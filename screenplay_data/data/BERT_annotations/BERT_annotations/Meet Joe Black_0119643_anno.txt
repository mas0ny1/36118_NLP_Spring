scene_heading: --------------------------------------------------------------
scene_heading: EXT. ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. - 4:00 AM
dialog: A patch of water. PULL BACK TO REVEAL more water. BACK
text: FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to
text: massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River
dialog: manor house; the country estate of William Parrish.
scene_heading: INT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 4:00 AM
text: MOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into
text: an expansive living room, DOWN wide corridors lined with
dialog: Bierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists
text: and trees and small boats and distant humans.
scene_heading: INT. PARRISH BEDROOM - 4:00 AM
text: MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish-
text: ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping
text: occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a
text: man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm.
text: Although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him.
text: Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain. Now the severity
text: of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm. The wind comes
text: up, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the
dialog: wind itself:
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: ... Yes.
dialog: Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is
text: not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades,
text: the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided.
text: He rises now, crosses to the bathroom. As he pees, a breeze
text: outside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes
dialog: up:
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Yes...
dialog: It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has
text: heard something, he looks around, but no one is there. He
text: can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom. All beweild-
text: ered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed,
dialog: trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't
dialog: heard; he is not sure.
text: He pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Yes.
text: Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one
text: there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up,
dialog: should he not, what is happening? He looks out: absolute
text: stillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a
text: light FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but
text: then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and
text: finally, exhausted, falls back asleep.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR TERRACE, PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - NEXT MORNING
text: The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un-
text: rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and
text: adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms,
text: speakers, lights. Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's
text: older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she
dialog: relishing every moment.
text: A Painter approaches.
speaker_heading: PAINTER
dialog: The big tent, Miss Allison --
speaker_heading: ALLISON
text: Paint is rust and moss green.
dialog: Medieval colors -- Daddy's like
dialog: an old knight.
text: A Florist stops her.
speaker_heading: FLORIST
dialog: The head table --?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: FLORIST
dialog: The flowers, ma'am--?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Freesia, freesia, everywhere. Daddy
dialog: loves freesia -- and you, over there,
dialog: lights. Not too bright. I'm looking
dialog: for a saffron glow -- sort of tea-
dialog: dance twenties.
scene_heading: EXT. GREAT HALL, COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING
text: Parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ-
text: ing the activity outside through the windows. He checks his
text: watch, strides down the hall, encounters MAY, 50, a family
text: retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish
dialog: passes.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What do you think of all this, May?
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: It's going to be beautiful. And
dialog: Miss Allison says the President may
dialog: come.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Oh, the President's got better
dialog: things to do than come to my
dialog: birthday party.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: What?
text: Parrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by Allison who,
text: on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Daddy!
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Hi, Allison --
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Have you got a minute?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Not much more. Big day in the big
dialog: city. What's on your mind?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Fireworks. Update -- we're con-
dialog: structing the number '65' on the
dialog: barge, archers from the State
dialog: College at New Paltz will shoot
text: flaming arrows at it, when it
dialog: catches fire it will give us the
dialog: effect of a Viking funeral with none
dialog: of the morbidity... The Hudson River
dialog: Authority says, for you, they'll
dialog: make a special dispensation - of
dialog: course there'll be an overtime bill
dialog: for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Allison, I trust you. This is your
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: But it's your birthday.
text: Parrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break-
text: fast room where SUSAN, 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is
text: grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Good morning, Dad.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Hi, honey.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (to Susan)
dialog: I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Drew called from the AStar, they're
text: still two minutes away.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Drew's aboard?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: He wanted to ride back down with
dialog: you. Now sit and relax, get some-
dialog: thing in that flat tummy of yours --
text: But Parrish only pours coffee.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: (to Allison)
dialog: You coming?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: You've got patients waiting, I've
dialog: got three hysterical chefs, one
dialog: loves truffles, the other hates
dialog: truffles, the third one doesn't know
dialog: what truffles are. I'd better drive
dialog: down.
text: Parrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing
dialog: in intensity.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (unconsciously)
dialog: I hate parties --
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're
dialog: going to love it.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Isn't it enough to be on this earth
dialog: sixty-five years without having to
dialog: be reminded of it.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: No.
text: Allison goes, Susan observes Parrish fidgeting.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Will you relax? I know it is a big
dialog: deal day --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: How did you know?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Drew told me.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Does Drew tell you everything?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I hope so.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You like him, don't you?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yeah. I guess so.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't like to interfere.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: ...Then don't.
text: The helicopter CHOPS in overhead.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: -- Here comes our boy now --
dialog: Shall we?
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING
text: A BUTLER and May carry the overnight bags for the family as
text: led by Parrish, they hurry towards the helicopter. En route
text: they pass QUINCE, 38, Allison's husband, who is perched at a
text: portable bar with AMBROSE, the head caterer, tasting wines.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: ...This shit's not bad.
speaker_heading: AMBROSE
dialog: -- The late harvest Riesling, Mr.
dialog: Quince, a possibility for dessert.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: (pointing to another
dialog: bottle)
dialog: And that?
speaker_heading: AMBROSE
dialog: Pinot Grigio. We're considering it
dialog: for the appetizer.
text: Ambrose takes a sip, swishes the wine in his mouth, spits it
text: in a bucket.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: What do you do that for?
speaker_heading: AMBROSE
dialog: Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: 9:30's almost 10:30. Where I come
dialog: from, the sun's over the yardarm,
text: m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
text: Quince drains his wine, presents it for a refill, when he is
dialog: hailed by Allison.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Quince! Everybody's waiting!
text: Quince downs this glass too, runs for the helicopter as
text: DREW, 34, a young man going places, emerges from it,
text: approaches Parrish and Susan.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Susan)
dialog: Hello, Beautiful.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hi.
text: Drew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Good morning, Drew. Thanks for
dialog: coming out.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Well, it's a big day. Wanted to
text: line up a few ducks before kickoff.
dialog: Any thoughts? Last minute refine-
dialog: ments or variations?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: 'Thoughts'? Not a one -- but I did
dialog: hear a voice last night.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: A voice?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: In my sleep.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What'd it say?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: 'Yes'.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: 'Yes' to the deal?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Maybe, who knows? You know how
dialog: voices are. Let's go.
text: Quince comes running up now.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Hi, Bill --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Good morning, Quince.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: How're you doing--?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I'm doing great. You ready?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: I am, this is it. B Day.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: How's that, Quince?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
text: Bontecou Day. Going to close
dialog: with Big John -- Look at you, Bill,
text: all cool as a cat and over at
dialog: Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting
text: in his pants.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (to Quince)
dialog: Honey, please.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Okay. All aboard - New York, New
dialog: York!
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Remember everybody, tonight, dinner
dialog: in the city at Daddy's. You too,
dialog: Drew. We've still got some loose
dialog: ends --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Not my birthday again?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're only six-five once.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Thank God. Now could we go? Let's
dialog: get this day started.
text: Drew ushers everybody on, first Parrish, then Susan and
text: Quince, Drew the last to climb on, shuts the door behind him
text: As Allison hurries away from the whirling rotors.
scene_heading: INT. ASTAR HELICOPTER - DAY
text: The configuration of seats has Drew beside Parrish, in front
text: of them Quince and Susan opposite each other in single seats.
text: Just as Drew removes color-coded folders from his attache
text: case and spreads them out for Parrish on his tray table, the
text: pilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'. Drew gets up
text: and heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances
text: over at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own.
text: He motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks
text: that Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into
text: her carryall, and crosses over to Parrish who folds away the
text: work that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I thought you were in a meeting--?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I am. With you.
text: He peers up ahead at Drew, on the telephone and gesticulat-
text: ing intensely, right at home in the cockpit despite the CHOP
text: of the blades and the pilot pressed up against him.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Do you love Drew?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: ...There's a start for a meeting.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I know it's none of my business --
text: Susan doesn't answer for a moment, then impulsively kisses her
dialog: father on the cheek.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, it's none of your business.
dialog: Another moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Do you love Drew?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You mean like you loved Mom?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Forget about me and Mom -- are you
dialog: going to marry him?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Probably.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Don't get carried away.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Uh oh --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Susan, you're a hell of a woman.
dialog: You've got a great career, you're
dialog: beautiful --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And I'm your daughter and no man
dialog: will ever be good enough for me.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Well, I wasn't going to say that --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What were you going to say?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Listen, I'm crazy about the guy --
dialog: He's smart, he's aggressive, he
dialog: could carry Parrish Communications
dialog: into the 21st century and me along
dialog: with it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: So what's wrong with that?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: That's for me. I'm talking about
dialog: you. It's not so much what you say
dialog: about Drew, it's what you don't say.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're not listening --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Oh yes, I am. Not an ounce of
dialog: excitement, not a whisper of a
dialog: thrill, this relationship has all
text: the passion of a pair of titmice.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't get dirty, Dad --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Well, it worries me. I want you
dialog: to get swept away. I want you to
dialog: levitate. I want you to sing with
text: rapture and dance like a dervish.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That's all?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Be deliriously happy. Or at least
dialog: leave yourself open to be.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: 'Be deliriously happy'. I'm going
dialog: to do my upmost --
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I know it's a cornball thing but
dialog: love is passion, obsession, someone
dialog: you can't live without. If you
dialog: don't start with that, what are you
dialog: going to end up with? I say fall
dialog: head over heels. Find someone you
dialog: can love like crazy and who'll love
dialog: you the same way back. And how do
dialog: you find him? Forget your head and
dialog: listen to your heart. I'm not
dialog: hearing any heart.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll
dialog: come back. Because, the truth is
dialog: there is no sense living your life
dialog: without this. To make the journey
dialog: and not fall deeply in love -- well,
dialog: you haven't lived a life at all.
dialog: You have to try. Because if you
dialog: haven't tried, you haven't lived.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Bravo.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Aw, you're tough.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'm sorry. But give it to me again.
dialog: The short version.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Stay open. Who knows? Lightning
dialog: could strike.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Forgive the lecture --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I won't. And when I tell Drew about
dialog: it, he won't either.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You won't tell him, and even if you
dialog: did, he'd clock it and punch it into
dialog: his laptop in order to pull out some
dialog: key phrases when he gives the
dialog: Commencement Speech at Wharton.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're terrible.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I know. But I'm the only father
dialog: you've got.
text: She kisses him on the cheek.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Thank God.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: He doesn't care. But thanks anyway.
scene_heading: EXT. 34TH STREET HELIPAD, NEW YORK CITY - DAY
text: The AStar lands, an attendant, waiting with a luggage cart,
text: rushes to open the door and unload the bags. The passengers,
text: Parrish paired with Quince, Drew with Susan, file off the
text: rooftop through a door which opens into an elevator.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR, NEW YORK CITY - DAY
text: Parrish, Susan, Drew and Quince face forward as they ride
dialog: downwards.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Hey, this is it, the hour approach-
dialog: es, I'm getting all excited. So
dialog: what do you think, is it --
dialog: (indicates Drew and
dialog: Parrish)
dialog: -- just the 'Executive Committee' or
dialog: could you guys use me?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer,
dialog: but it's all set for just me and Bill.
dialog: More people might --
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: I know. Gum up the works.
text: Parrish is about to make some reassuring comment to Quince
dialog: when the Voice suddenly intrudes:
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: '...I know, it's none of my
dialog: business.'
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I was saying to Quince we won't
dialog: need --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Did you just hear something?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Why yes, Bill, I was saying to
dialog: Quince --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No no, not you.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Daddy, what's the matter?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Nothing. I'm sorry.
text: A respectful silence, the elevator continues downwards,
text: suddenly the Voice intrudes again:
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: '...I want you to levitate. I want
dialog: you to sing with rapture and dance
dialog: like a dervish.'
text: Parrish grunts bizarrely, Susan notices and reacts:
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What is it, Daddy --?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Nothing.
text: Parrish's eyes dart about, confirming no one has heard a
dialog: thing but him.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Just talking to myself again. You
dialog: know me --
text: The elevator door opens.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Well, here we are --
text: Parrish leads the group out.
scene_heading: EXT. 34TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY - DAY
text: They exit the building.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: A-Okay. Got my gloves on, my ears
dialog: pricked. I'm ready for action.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, go get 'em, Pops.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yer damn right.
text: Parrish, followed by Drew, steps into a waiting limousine,
text: Quince looks longingly after them. Susan, blowing a kiss
text: goodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a
dialog: cab.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, BONTECOU WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: ...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo
dialog: opportunity, you and Big John, it'll
dialog: lead network news. Okay so far?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Sounds good.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: It's going to be great --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Do you think I need a haircut?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Bill, after this deal, you'll be
dialog: able to afford one.
text: Parrish smiles, they step into the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. BONTECOU EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY
text: Parrish and Drew emerge from the elevator, Parrish observing
dialog: the overkill decor.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Their PR guy asked me, what did I
dialog: think Parrish Communications stood
dialog: for, that's principle and ethics-
dialog: wise? I came up with something, but
dialog: then it occurred to me, why don't I
dialog: ask Bill? What do you think?
text: A moment, Parrish shrugs.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Our first annual report, must be
dialog: thirty-five years ago now, I owned
dialog: two stations, I wrote down a state-
dialog: ment of purpose, that one day you
dialog: would wake up to a Parrish radio
dialog: station, read a Parrish paper at
dialog: breakfast, catch our news on tele-
dialog: vision during the day, and go to bed
dialog: with one of our books or magazines
dialog: and you would always be told the
dialog: truth and in the bargain, have a
dialog: good time.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: That's great! Wait 'til I show it
dialog: to Bontecou.
text: Drew opens a door, a conference room, a circle of top exec-
text: utives, now stepping out from the group is a huge, white-
text: haired man, JOHN BONTECOU, 55.
speaker_heading: BONTECOU
dialog: Bill, thanks for coming over...
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: And how're you doing today, Drew?
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: You've got a firecracker here, the
dialog: kid's really set the table.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Good, good. Glad to hear it.
speaker_heading: BONTECOU
dialog: We've met before, y'know, that White
dialog: House function, the President had
dialog: you on his right and you know where
dialog: I was?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I'm sorry, I don't recall --
speaker_heading: BONTECOU
dialog: Left field somewhere. Well, Bill, I
dialog: want to come in from the outfield,
dialog: bat cleanup like you have, learn the
dialog: plush ropes --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I thought you were buying my company.
speaker_heading: BONTECOU
dialog: Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy
dialog: Parrish Communications. I could pay
dialog: for it, of course, but it would
dialog: always have your imprint.
text: Silence. Parrish looks around at the circle of 'suits',
dialog: Bontecou holding away.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Well, that's very nice to hear.
text: Drew nods excitedly.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL CORNELL MEDICAL CENTER - DAY
text: The busy medical community at 68th Street and New York Avenue.
scene_heading: INT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK AVENUE - DAY
text: A thriving eatery diagonally across from the hospital's
text: entrance, customers cheek-by-jowl as a pair of waiters
text: juggle breakfasts served to a noisy throng of doctors,
dialog: residents and interns.
text: Susan has squeezed into a seat in the corner. A counterman,
text: with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front
text: of her. A sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for
text: the day; immediately she becomes aware of a man behind her
text: speaking into the pay phone.
text: An attractive YOUNG MAN, early 30's, a pair of suitcase at
text: his feet, a raincoat slung over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: ...Honey, you've got to go on...
dialog: there's a time to sow and a time to
dialog: reap, you sow now and forget about
dialog: him... yeah, I liked him, I don't
dialog: like him anymore... because you're
dialog: my honey and anybody messes with you
dialog: messes with me -- I'm on a plane in
dialog: a minute... as soon as I get my
dialog: phone in, you're my first call,
dialog: that's a promise... where you going
dialog: now?... good, hit the books, get that
dialog: degree, one day we'll hang out a
dialog: shingle together... you bet, honey...
dialog: later.
text: The Young Man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an
text: overflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the
text: counterman refills his cup and the Young Man ties into the
dialog: breakfast, eating it with such relish that Susan can't take
text: her eyes off him. He senses her eyes, glances over, his
text: cheeks filled with a mouthful of food, swallows embarrassedly.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Good morning, I was talking kind of
dialog: loud there, sorry.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Not at all. It was fascinating.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Oh yeah? What was 'fascinating'
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You and 'Honey'?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: My kid sister. She just broke up
dialog: with her boyfriend and she's
dialog: thinking about dropping out of
dialog: law school.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'm sorry --
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Nothing to be sorry about. That's
dialog: the way with men and women, isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What's the way?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Nothing lasts.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I agree --
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I was just being agreeable, now I've
dialog: got to explain why?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I'm not trying to sharpshoot you,
dialog: but that 'nothing lasts' stuff,
dialog: that's what was the trouble with
dialog: Honey's guy. He was fooling around
dialog: and Honey caught him at it. One
dialog: girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: So you're a one-girl guy?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Damn right. Looking for her right
dialog: now. Who knows? You might be her.
dialog: Susan laughs.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
dialog: Well, don't laugh. I just arrived
dialog: in town, got a new job -- I'm trying
dialog: to get into this apartment. You a
dialog: doctor?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: How'd you know?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Everybody's a doctor around here.
dialog: This apartment house is all green
dialog: pajamas and slippers. The guy I'm
text: waiting for to vacate is a doctor.
dialog: What kind of doctor?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Me? Internal medicine.
text: The Young Man smiles.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: So if I needed a doctor, you could
dialog: be it?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I could be her.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: 'Her'.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes, I could.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: I have an office in the hospital.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: -- This is my lucky day. I arrive
dialog: in this big bad city and I not only
text: find a doctor, a beautiful woman as
dialog: well.
text: Susan looks into her coffee.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sorry, you mind my saying that?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: How 'bout another cup of coffee?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I've got patients coming in --
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: And I want to get into my apartment
dialog: and go to work. Please, what do you
dialog: say, another cup of coffee?
text: Two pots are warming behind the counter, he reaches over and
text: refills her cup and his. Pushes a container and pitcher to-
dialog: wards her.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
dialog: I see you use lots of sugar and
dialog: cream. Me, too...
text: They smile at each other, fix up their coffee.
scene_heading: EXT. PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS, NEW YORK CITY - DAY
text: A magnificent granite building, a monument to good taste in
text: the midtown sea of glass and aluminum.
scene_heading: INT. OUTER LOBBY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY
text: Parrish and Drew enter, no particular fanfare but an aware-
dialog: ness the 'Chief' has arrived, everyone giving Parrish the
text: appropriate wide berth, Drew right beside him.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I'm all excited --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I thought it was great, I thought
dialog: you and Big John would be like a
dialog: couple of bulls in a china shop --
dialog: (faltering)
dialog: Instead it was --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Like a marriage made in heaven?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You have a way with words.
text: They stride to the main bank of elevators.
scene_heading: INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICES, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY
text: Parrish, Drew beside him, proceeds through a high tech, but
text: tasteful, maze, spiffy executive secretaries at burnished
text: desks. Neither looking right or left, somehow Parrish man-
text: ages to acknowledge their bright smiles and deferential nods
text: despite his swift entrance.
text: He passes through an open set of doors and he is into his
text: own suite, commanded by JENNIFER, his assistant.
speaker_heading: JENIFER
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Hi, Jennifer.
text: Drew is still at Parrish's heels, but now Parrish stops at
text: the open door, turns back to him, reminding Drew that this
dialog: is as far as he goes without being invited.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll
dialog: recommend, we close and it's a deal,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: As close as a deal could be.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (bursting)
dialog: Olympic.
text: Parrish disappears into his office. Drew, on his way out,
text: glides past Jennifer's desk.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: This is our lucky day.
text: Jennifer acknowledges Drew with a smile, rises and moves to
text: Parrish's doorway, waiting for the day's instructions, but
text: Parrish only nods to the door and Jennifer quickly closes
text: it, returns to her desk.
scene_heading: INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Alone in his office, Parrish's ebullient mood immediately
text: changes. Leaning against the back of the couch, he stares
text: out through floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the
text: Manhattan skyline: cogitates.
text: He takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he
text: flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder. It is sharp
text: but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he
dialog: ignores it.
text: Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the
text: pain comes again. He reaches for his shoulder, tries to
text: massage the pain, it does not subside. Parrish stands,
text: trying to shake it off, but it refuses to go away, some-
text: thing is unmistakably wrong. Now a SOUND which he has
dialog: come to recognize, makes itself heard:
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Yes.
text: Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the
dialog: source of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction,
text: yet surrounds him. Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply
text: intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a
text: corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other
text: clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently
text: seized the upper part of his body. He breaks out in a sweat,
text: his pallor now waxen as the Voice repeats itself:
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
dialog: ...Yes.
text: Parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him
text: on the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer,
text: each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself,
text: consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a
text: hallucination but which he is certain is not. Parrish is
text: possessed. He angles his face in every direction, arbi-
text: trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly, unconsciously,
text: enrage, responds to the Voice.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: 'Yes' what?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: 'Yes' is the answer to your
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I didn't ask any question.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I believe you did.
text: Parrish is absolutely confounded, seized up with pain and
dialog: consternation at this unseen Voice which has such presence
dialog: and reality.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Goddammit, what is going on?!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I think you know --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Try. Because 'if you haven't tried,
dialog: you haven't lived'.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What you were talking about.
dialog: Parrish gasps.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What is this? Who is this fucking
dialog: guy?
text: He holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping,
text: his skin ashen. Now he addresses the Voice again, searching
dialog: for it in another direction:
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Tell me who you are!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Are you giving me orders?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I'm sorry, I --
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: No, you're not. You're trying to
dialog: 'handle' the situation but this is
dialog: the one situation you knew you never
dialog: could handle.
text: A spasm, the worst one yet, finally it subsides and there is
text: an eerie silence in the room, a VOID, almost more disturbing
text: than the voice that has filled it.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Where are you? Are you there?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It's enough now.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Please. Talk to me --
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: There's going to be plenty of time
dialog: for that.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What do you mean?!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I think you know --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Know what?
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Know what, goddammit!
text: The VOICE is gone. Parrish searches the corner, but the
dialog: room has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by
text: the VOICE, it is now just Parrish's office. Faint SQUEALS of
text: traffic from the street, then a KNOCK at the door.
text: Parrish touches his shoulder, the pain is gone, but he is
text: still wet with sweat, the KNOCK again. Parrish straightens
text: himself up, adjusts his tie, runs his fingers through his
text: hair, blinks as he addresses the door.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Come in.
text: Jennifer enters.
speaker_heading: JENIFER
dialog: I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish.
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: JENIFER
dialog: Lunch is 'in' today, have you given
dialog: it any thought --_
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: No. Nothing.
speaker_heading: JENIFER
dialog: Nothing?
text: Parrish is within himself, doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: JENIFER (cont'd)
dialog: Why don't I think of something?
text: Parrish still doesn't answer, however Jennifer is satisfied,
text: correctly hearing his silence as an affirmative. She has her
text: hand on the door, 'Open' or 'Closed'? He nods and she closes it.
text: Utter silence again. Parrish's eyes search the room, nothing
dialog: there.
scene_heading: INT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, YORK AVENUE, DAY
text: The place has cleared out now, the counterman busy bussing
text: tables laden with dishes and cups, Susan and the Young Man
text: are still at the counter, but about to leave.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: ...It's kind of a pro bono job.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: 'Pro bono'. That means doing good
dialog: -- Going to be doing good all your
dialog: life?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I know what you're saying. Doesn't
dialog: pay very well. Depends on the woman
dialog: I marry. Maybe she'd like a bigger
dialog: house, a better car, lotsa kids,
dialog: college doesn't come cheap --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You'd give up what you want for the
dialog: woman you marry?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I would.
text: Susan rises now, the Young Man with her, leaving money for
text: their checks they head for the door.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
dialog: If I married you, I'd want to give
dialog: you what you wanted, I know it's
dialog: old fashioned and all that, but
dialog: what's wrong with taking care of a
dialog: woman? She takes care of you.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You'll have a hard time finding a
dialog: woman like that these days --
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You never know. Lightning could
dialog: strike.
text: Susan at the door now, pauses abruptly, her eyes on the
dialog: Young Man.
scene_heading: EXT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, YORK AVENUE - DAY
text: The Young Man holds the door for Susan as they step out
text: onto the street.
text: Susan is staring at him now, he smiles, all open and
dialog: vulnerable.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I've got to go --
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Did I say something wrong?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, it was so right it scares me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I've been thinking... I don't want
dialog: you to be my doctor. Because I
dialog: don't want you to examine me.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Because I like you so much.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: You have coffee here every morning,
dialog: don't you? If I came by, could you
dialog: give me the name of a doctor?
dialog: Another moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Sure, I'll give you the name of a
dialog: doctor.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: ...And I don't want to examine you.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Because I like you so much. Now
dialog: I've got to go.
text: She hurries away down the sidewalk, the Young Man watching
text: her. Now he turns and starts off in the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - SUSAN
text: She looks back at the Young Man, then turns and walks on.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - THE YOUNG MAN
text: He looks back at Susan as the distance between them widens,
text: now he turns and walks on.
speaker_heading: ON SUSAN
text: She looks around once more but the Young Man is still headed
text: in the opposite direction, his back to her. She turns the
text: corner and continues on.
speaker_heading: ON THE YOUNG MAN
text: Approaching the corner, he looks back for Susan yet again,
text: but she is gone, still turned he steps off into the street
text: and a hospital supplies truck, speeding down the curb lane,
text: HITS HIM BROADSIDE, a horrific impact, the THUD echoes as
text: his body arcs through the air.
text: Another sickening THUD as it lands, the Young Man lies
text: crumpled, still.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
text: A beautiful space adjacent to the dining room, it has a
text: glass roof which offers a superb view of the Manhattan sky-
text: line. The hour is before dinner: gathered on one side of
text: the room are Allison and Parrish, on the other side Drew and
text: Quince. COYLE, a butler, and LUISA, the housekeeper, pass
dialog: hors d'oeuvres and drinks.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: ...Music, I know how you love music,
dialog: Daddy, and I want to have music that
dialog: pleases you -- and of course doesn't
dialog: put a thousand other people to sleep
dialog: -- I've agonized over this and
dialog: finally settled on Sidney Brown,
dialog: twenty-four men, very eclectic, plus
dialog: I'm feathering in a Latin sextet on
dialog: their breaks - Tito Puente, Trini
dialog: Lopez-zy, I forget their names --
text: Parrish has tuned Allison out, he tried to stay with it, but
dialog: his mind has wandered, the event of the day too much with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: You haven't heard a word, have you?
dialog: I keep talking and all you do is nod
dialog: like Mr. Himmelfass in The
dialog: Nutcracker.
text: Parrish still doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: You don't care, do you?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What, honey?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I lay awake nights in a cold sweat,
dialog: I want this party to be like some-
dialog: thing Mom would have made for you,
dialog: I want it to be perfect --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (attentive now)
dialog: I know you do, darling.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: And you could care less --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Oh, you couldn't be more wrong,
dialog: sweetheart. I can' tell you how
dialog: much I appreciate it and how I'm
dialog: looking forward to it.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Good. Songs. What songs should
dialog: Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we
dialog: can forget about -- what songs do
dialog: you think he should play?
text: A stab of pain, Parrish discreetly grabs his upper arm but
text: manages to keep his attention on Allison.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Tell it to me again.
text: Suddenly, the Voice cuts in:
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: ...Yes.
text: Parrish's head snaps, startled by the SOUND.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Did you miss me?
text: Parrish reacts once more, aware again he is the only one who
text: has heard the Voice, as an oblivious Allison continues:
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Never mind. Leave it to me.
text: Parrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the
text: Voice. His eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy and fearful.
speaker_heading: LUISA
text: Mr. Parrish, dinner is served.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (to Quince and Drew,
dialog: across the room)
dialog: Chow-time, you guys.
text: Parrish is confounded. Blindly and disconcerted, he follows
dialog: Allison and Drew and Quince.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: As a disturbed Parrish approaches the table, he hears the
dialog: Voice once more:
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: What are you looking so provoked
dialog: about? 'Did you miss me?' It's
dialog: a normal question. I missed you.
dialog: But what do I get back? 'Not an
dialog: ounce of excitement, not a whisper
dialog: of a thrill --'
dialog: Parrish sits.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
dialog: '-- This relationship has all the
dialog: passion of a pair of titmice'.
text: Parrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his
dialog: panic.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
dialog: I'm waiting outside.
text: The conversation swirls on around Parrish, he is deaf to it:
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: Did you speak to the Governor?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: He's coming.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: His wife?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Unfortunately. I sat between them
dialog: at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was
dialog: better than Seconal.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: I'm waiting outside. Won't someone
dialog: come to the door?
text: Parrish is in shock, still striving to gain control of
text: himself. As Coyle serves him, Parrish turns to Luisa:
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Is somebody waiting outside, Luisa?
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: I didn't hear a ring, sir.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Please have a look --
text: Luisa goes as Coyle continues serving.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (to Quince)
dialog: What about the Mayor?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: He said he would be there with bells
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Good, maybe they'll drown him out.
text: Parrish is still not hearing a word, preoccupied with the
dialog: return of Luisa.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Please don't be negative, Drew, we
dialog: have an acceptance list that would
dialog: do The White House proud -- The
dialog: Secretary-General of the UN, the
dialog: Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators,
dialog: I don't know how many Congressmen,
dialog: and at least twelve of the Fortune
dialog: '500'.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: No jocks? A twenty-game winner or a
dialog: Masters champion? Someone I could
dialog: talk to.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Or would talk to me.
text: Luisa returns to Parrish as the others' conversation drones
dialog: on:
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: You're right, Mr. Parrish. There
dialog: was a gentleman at the door. He's
dialog: waiting for you in the foyer.
text: Parrish is stunned.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: Show him into the library, tell him
dialog: I'll be right there.
text: Parrish, spinning with anxiety, tries to summon up his courage
dialog: to go as Allison continues:
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I've arranged for favors -- silver
dialog: charm bracelets for the women,
dialog: platinum keychains for the men --
dialog: all engraved 'W.P.' -- but now I'm
dialog: thinking of scrubbing them, they
dialog: seem so ordinary.
text: Finally Parrish rises from the table, starts out.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: Are they ordinary? Do they seem
dialog: that way to you, Daddy?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Uh -- I don't know. No - uh - I
dialog: don't...
text: Allison is about to press the point, but then drifts into
text: disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Allison)
dialog: You're overthinking it --
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: I don't think they're ordinary. I
dialog: love keychains.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Parrish moves deliberately down the hall, slows as he nears
text: the doorway to the library. The door is open. He hesitates
text: before he crosses the threshold, taking in as much as his
text: eye can see, now tentatively, he enters.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: A beautiful, classic room, areas of dim, warm light, club
text: chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library
text: ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, a model boat
text: carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from
text: the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured
dialog: glass.
text: Parrish, poised in the doorway, looks around, nothing in
dialog: sight.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Hello?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Anyone here?
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: I said is anyone here?!
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Quiet down.
text: Parrish is startled, he shrinks backward for a moment, his
text: eyes searching the room for the Voice, the timbre and pitch
dialog: of which is exactly what he has heard before. There is the
text: sense that someone is there but Parrish cannot see him, and
text: he does not dare look.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: I'm here.
text: Now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured
text: glass, the section of the room most distant from Parrish,
text: there is a shape. Something is there.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What is this, a joke, right? Some
dialog: kind of elaborate practical joke?
dialog: At my 40th reunion, we delivered a
dialog: casket to the Class president's
dialog: hotel room and --
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Quiet.
text: Parrish falls silent, something in the SOUND and TONE of the
text: Voice muting him. He takes a step backwards.
speaker_heading: VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I - I - uh --
text: The shape moves, makes itself more visible. Although still
text: diffused by the glass, the shape has definition, a person, a
text: man, his features are not yet distinguishable, but he is
dialog: there all right.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: The great Bill Parrish at a loss for
dialog: words? The man from whose lips fall
dialog: 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses-
dialog: sion'...all those admonitions about
dialog: being 'deliberately happy', what
dialog: there is no sense 'living your life
dialog: without...', all the sparks and
dialog: energy you give off, the rosy advice
dialog: you dispense in round, pear-shaped
dialog: tones --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What the hell is this? Who are you?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Just think of millenniums multiplied
dialog: by aeons compounded by infinity,
dialog: I've been around that long, but it's
dialog: only recently that your affairs here
dialog: have piqued my interest. Call it
dialog: boredom, the natural curiosity of
dialog: me, the most lasting and significant
dialog: element in existence has come to see
dialog: you.
text: Parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I want to have a look around before
dialog: I take you.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: 'Take me'...? Where?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It requires competence, wisdom,
dialog: experience -- all those things they
dialog: say about you in testimonials --
dialog: and you're the one.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: 'The one' to do what?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Show me around. Be my guide. And
dialog: in return, you get...
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Get what?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Time.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What the hell are you talking about?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Watch it!
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I'm sorry --
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: In return you'll receive minuets, days,
dialog: weeks, I'm not going to go into details
dialog: ... what matters is that I stay
dialog: interested.
text: Parrish squints, trying to make sense of what is happening.
speaker_heading: VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: ...'Yes'.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yes what?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: 'Yes' is the answer to your ques-
dialog: tion.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What question?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Bill. Come on. The question. The
dialog: question you've been asking yourself
dialog: with increased regularity, at odd
text: moments, panting through the extra
dialog: game of handball, when you ran for
dialog: the plane in Delhi, when you sat up
dialog: in bed last night and hit the floor
dialog: in the office this morning. The
dialog: question that is in the back of your
dialog: throat, choking the blood to your
text: brain, ringing in the ears over and
dialog: over as you put it to yourself --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: The 'question' --
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (urging)
dialog: Yes, Bill. The question.
dialog: After a moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: ...Am I going to die?
text: The figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no
text: longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, re-
dialog: vealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the
text: coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, off-
text: center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Yes.
text: A moment, Parrish beside himself. He cannot bring himself
dialog: to speak, finally:
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Am I dreaming this?
dialog: (Another moment)
dialog: Are you a dream?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I am not a dream.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You're coming to 'take me'. What is
dialog: that? Who the hell are you?
text: The Young Man steps closer to Parrish, his face is inches
text: from a shaking, sweating Parrish's face, the Young Man
dialog: daring Parrish to identify him:
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You are --?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: (urging again)
dialog: '...Yes --'
text: Parrish turns away. But the Young Man, spectacularly, is in
text: front of him again.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Who am I?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: ...Death.
text: Parrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what
text: he has comprehended. He surveys the Young Man who, at this
text: moment, actually seems bewildered by his effect.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: You're Death?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Death!
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: That's me.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You're not Death. You're just a kid
text: in a jacket and a pair of pants.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
text: The jacket and the pair of pants
dialog: came with the body I took. Let me
dialog: ask your opinion. Do I blend in?
text: A hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You want me to be your guide --?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You fill the bill, Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I do?
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: How long will you be staying?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You should hope quite a while.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: And then --?
text: The Young Man nods, gently.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: It's... it's... over.
text: A long silence. Parrish and the Young Man take each other in,
text: the sense that now they understand each other. A SOUND at the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: LUISA (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Parrish?
text: Parrish does not hear her for the moment, Luisa steps inside
dialog: the Library.
speaker_heading: LUISA (cont'd)
dialog: Will the gentleman be staying for
dialog: dinner, sir?
text: Parrish ignores her at first, finally he looks at Luisa then
text: at the Young Man, then once more at both of them as if to
dialog: verify the Young Man's presence has been acknowledged by
dialog: Luisa. The Young Man interjects:
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: (to Luisa)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (a polite afterthought)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Luisa nods perfunctorily and exits. Parrish is frozen,
dialog: dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Where is dinner?
text: Parrish does not answer at first.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: This is crazy -- you're not going to
dialog: eat dinner with us.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Bill, I am eating dinner with you.
dialog: And your family. And that's what
dialog: we're doing. It's not open for
dialog: discussion. Nothing is. Don't
dialog: you understand?
text: Parrish is frightened by the response.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
dialog: Good. Now lead the way.
text: Parrish hesitates, then obediently leads the Young Man out
text: of the library, down a long hallway and across the foyer.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Excuse me? Could I say something?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It just occurred to me --
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Speak up, please.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (louder)
dialog: When I introduce you, if I say who
dialog: you are, I don't think anyone will
dialog: stay for dinner.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Then don't.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: As Parrish and the Young Man enter, Allison is heard in the
dialog: background.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: ...Well, here's another possibility.
dialog: It's a little last minute, but how does
dialog: this strike you? Kaleidoscopes. Little
dialog: gold kaleidoscopes. Some German firm
dialog: went kerplunkt, Tiffany's picked these
dialog: things up, they're perfect party favors,
dialog: however they're not personal, they're
dialog: winter scene or something, snow-flakes
dialog: and dachshunds...
text: Parrish and the Young Man appear at the table, an awkward
text: pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family
text: dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully survey-
text: ed. Finally, Allison breaks the ice:
speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: (to the Young Man)
dialog: Hi there --
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Hello.
text: Parrish is horribly uncomfortable as the Young Man looks at
text: each person as if he were discovering a face of the first
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Uh -- sorry -- to have stepped away
dialog: for so long -- uh -- this is a
dialog: friend of mine I asked to drop by --
dialog: we got to talking and stuff -- uh --
dialog: he's going to join us for dinner --
dialog: um --
text: Parrish drifts into another awkward pause.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (to the Young Man)
dialog: Hello, how nice to meet you. And
dialog: wouldn't it be nicer if my father
dialog: would introduce you?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: (to Allison)
dialog: '...How nice to meet you.'
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. This is my daughter,
dialog: Allison, and her husband, Quince,
dialog: Drew, my number one, works with me...
text: Parrish drifts off as the Young Man awkwardly shakes hands
dialog: with each person.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (prompting)
dialog: Daddy. Does your friend have a name?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: A name?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (pleasantly, going
dialog: along with the joke)
dialog: Yeah, something he goes by --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Oh, excuse me. This is -- uh --
dialog: this is --
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Daddy! Come on, a name.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone
dialog: right out of my head --
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sorry. This is - uh - uh...
text: The group waits patiently.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Joe!
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Joe...
text: Parrish once more drifts into silence. (The YOUNG MAN is now
dialog: identified as "JOE".)
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Just plain 'Joe'?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Love that name.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Me, too. Hey, buddy!
text: Joe, turned on by Quince's broad smile, reacts to it as Drew
text: squints observingly at Joe.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: 'Joe...'
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Is there any more to it?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
text: Parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name,
text: a furtive glance at Joe. Parrish's brow darkens and a name
text: tumbles from his lips:
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: -- Black.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Whew, at last. Nice to meet you,
dialog: Mr. Black.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: 'Joe Black'. Won fifteen and lost
dialog: two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in
dialog: 1952.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: You bet. I'm kind of my Rotisserie
dialog: League.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: He is! Let's sit down --
text: Luisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which
text: was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned.
text: Joe looks over at the other guests, then picks up his uten-
text: sils gingerly, strives to copy the others, stops, staring at
dialog: his foot.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: Paillarde of veal.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Yeah, they hit the calf over the
text: head with a mallet and then Luisa
text: hits it again in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Honey --!
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: You know what I'm saying, Joe?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (laughing emptily)
dialog: Joe knows what you're saying, just
dialog: being polite --
dialog: Drew is studying Joe.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: Have we met?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Uh -- he's from out of town --
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: How long you here, Joe?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: As long as it takes.
text: Drew is provoked by the response, but remains polite:
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You and Bill old friends?
dialog: Parrish jumps in:
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: I get the feeling you've done some
dialog: business before.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We have an arrangement now.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What side of the industry did you
dialog: say you were on?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I didn't say.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill. I
dialog: have the feeling you guys got the
dialog: broad strokes already. Need any
dialog: help with the details?
text: Parrish falls silent again, looking for an answer.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sorry -- business at dinner...
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: Forgive me for being so rude.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sure.
text: The doors to the dining room open, Susan appears.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hi, everybody. Sorry to be late -
dialog: had to have dinner with my depart-
dialog: ment chief --
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: You ate?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: ...I'm here, aren't I? Wouldn't
dialog: miss a loose end meeting. What's on
dialog: the table for discussion? Party
dialog: favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
text: She kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have ob-
text: viously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water
text: toys and their lips meeting mid-air.
text: At the kiss's conclusion Susan suddenly notices Joe is
text: present and has been watching. She is shocked, embarrassed,
text: pleased, conflicted, an instant and wide spectrum of emotions.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: What are you doing here?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: You know each other?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: We've met.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: -- This morning. The Corinth Coffee
dialog: Shop. He was looking for a doctor.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Well, I guess he's found one.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Joe, you do get around.
text: Joe is happily confounded by all the interaction.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That's your name?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: And isn't it a lovely one? So
dialog: sturdy, so straight --
text: Joe has heard Susan's question but, as he studies her,
dialog: doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Incidentally, Joe, where're you
dialog: staying?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Here...
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: 'Here'?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: In this house?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Great!
text: Parrish pushes his plate away.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Black.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Hey, this is fun.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: So, what are you doing here?
text: Parrish tenses, but Joe doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Cat got your tongue? You weren't so
dialog: silent this morning.
text: Drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Now, I'm getting interested. I want
dialog: to know more ---
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: We've got some things to discuss.
text: Parrish stands, motions for Joe to rise.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: -- Did I hear 'business'?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What 'business'?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Don't bother asking, we already
dialog: tried.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's so very nice to see you again.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Funny, I don't get that feeling.
dialog: Maybe it's because you found out
dialog: I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Cut it out, Susan.
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: You and I've got to talk. Big day
dialog: tomorrow, everybody. Joe, let's go.
text: Joe rises, follows Parrish to the door, stops:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Susan)
dialog: Susan.
dialog: (to Allison)
dialog: Allison.
dialog: (to Quince)
dialog: Quince.
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: Drew.
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Bill...
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: Thank you.
text: He makes an awkward little bow, then heads for the nearest
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Joe, that's the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thank you.
text: Joe pivots, and he follows Parrish out the proper door.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: That was 'Joe'.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: He's cute.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Very.
text: Susan's eyes are still on the door where Joe exited, her
text: face reflecting her irritation and bewilderment, as well as
text: a tinge of excitement.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Parrish leads the way, Joe beside him as they progress through
dialog: the huge house.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: ...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon-
dialog: certed, that stuff between you and
dialog: Susan -- uh -- threw me.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: 'Threw' you? Where?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Shook me up. I mean that you knew
dialog: her and everything --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I didn't know her. The body I took
dialog: knew her. The man she met in the
dialog: coffee shop this morning. I - uh -
dialog: took him.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: So there's nothing between you and
dialog: Susan?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I wish you had said something to me
dialog: about staying here --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It hadn't occurred to me until then.
dialog: I was just having such a wonderful
dialog: time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm
dialog: here for?
text: Parrish suddenly looks very anxious, Joe stops.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: You seem uncomfortable, Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No, I'm okay with this - uh - I
dialog: think. So --
text: He opens a door.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: Bathroom...tub...towels, sauna --
text: Parrish turns back to the bedroom.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: ...Chair, lamp, bed --
text: Parrish is in a stunned state, chatters on unconsciously:
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Box springs, they're assembled in
dialog: Jakarta. Had to stay in a station
dialog: manager's house there unexpectedly
dialog: - best night's sleep I ever had.
dialog: Ordered twenty, they filled a con-
dialog: tainer and shipped them right over,
dialog: I've put one in every bedroom here
dialog: and in the country.
text: Joe tests the springs.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What a good idea.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Thank you. Would you like the man's
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No.
text: Parrish glances around, a room in which the occupant could
dialog: not want for anything.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: If there is anything else, don't
dialog: hesitate --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: How long have I got?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: Let's put it this way. When I go,
dialog: you go.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: When you go, I go.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's the best I can do.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: ...but minute-by-minute, I find
dialog: myself lingering.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: ...I just saw my doctor, he told me
dialog: everything was fine.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Your doctor?
dialog: (icily)
dialog: Did your doctor say anything about
dialog: a tiny, undetectable hole in your
dialog: aorta? Did he mention an irreparab-
dialog: ly weak vein in the further reaches
dialog: of your famous brain? Were they any
dialog: prognostications about the possibil-
dialog: ilites of a fatal collision on a golf
text: cart of suffocating in an avalanche
dialog: on a skin vacation in Gstaad?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I hope you realize, Bill...in your
dialog: office this morning, that was your
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Closer than that.
text: Parrish keeps still, trying to cool the heat of Joe's
dialog: temper.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: ...But meanwhile, you are still
dialog: here. Count your blessings. Call
text: it gravy, frosting on the cake,
dialog: whatever it is you say.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Well, thank you for letting me know.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: And - uh - I guess, 'goodnight'.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Good night to you, Bill.
text: Parrish gently closes the door.
text: Joe looks around, checks out his surroundings: curious,
dialog: attentive.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Parrish, unsteady, starts back down the hall, Luisa appears.
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: ...Miss Allison asked if you would
dialog: like to have your dinner kept warm?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No. Thanks, Luisa.
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: Very good, sir.
dialog: Luisa turns:
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Luisa --
dialog: She stops.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Mr. Black's luggage was misplaced by
dialog: the airlines. Would you mind get-
dialog: ting a few things together for him?
dialog: A couple of suits, some shirts,
dialog: ties, underwear, shoes. Have Coyle
dialog: take his measurements off what he is
dialog: wearing tonight.
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: Certainly, sir.
text: Luisa nods, and heads back downstairs. Parrish enters
text: his den, takes a seat in his chair, stares into the middle
text: distance, ruminates.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Joe has been examining his room, full of curiosity and
text: wonderment at the oddest things, the handle on a casement
text: window, the hem and weight of the fabric of a drape, hinges
text: on the bedroom door. In the process he opens this door,
text: steps out into the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Joe wanders down the hallway past the occasional Dufy or
text: Miro, a Venetian tapestry cheek-by-jowl with a miniature
text: Ming vae, and even a Bonsai garden with a trickling vein
dialog: of water.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: In the "back" of the house now, utilitarian paint and decor,
text: the SOUND of laughter and a glare of light. Joe enters.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The staff is at ease, some smoking, remains of food around.
text: Coyle, the butler, has his back to Joe and does not see him
text: for a moment. In front of Coyle, an open jar of peanut but-
text: ter which he is spreading in generous hunks of Wonder Bread.
text: Joe is fascinated by the process. Coyle suddenly hears the
text: silence, looks up and see Joe, standing up embarrassedly.
speaker_heading: COYLE
dialog: Yes, sir?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hello. I'm Joe Black. Nice to meet
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: COYLE
dialog: Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
text: The staff all mumble expansive "Good evening, sir"s to Joe.
text: He motions to them to sit, they do but Coyle does not. Coyle
dialog: shifts from foot-to-foot, the staff is not used to having
dialog: Parrish family or guests in this part of the house.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Coyle)
dialog: What are you eating.
speaker_heading: COYLE
dialog: You mean this, sir?
text: Coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly.
speaker_heading: COYLE (cont'd)
dialog: Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: 'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: You like it?
speaker_heading: COYLE
dialog: I would say, sir, it is right up
dialog: there with Jif and Skippy. But
text: miles ahead of Peter Pan.
dialog: (another moment)
dialog: Like a taste?
text: Joe nods, Coyle fashions a spoonful, offers it to Joe. Joe
text: swallows it. But he has not yet found a comfortable way of
text: masticating, his mouth and tongue go every which way, the
text: staff observes him, fascinated.
speaker_heading: COYLE (cont'd)
dialog: You're a peanut butter man now, eh,
dialog: sir?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes, I am. I thoroughly enjoyed
dialog: this - uh - peanut butter.
dialog: (to the staff)
dialog: And I thoroughly enjoyed meeting
dialog: you.
text: Joe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast
dialog: to the staff.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: I'll be moseying on.
text: He heads out, with the spoonful of peanut butter, to cheer-
dialog: ful "Goodnight, Mr. Black"'s, his tongue again licking the
dialog: edges of the spoon.
scene_heading: INT. SWIMMING POOL, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY
text: A spectacular indoor Olympic pool, window commanding views
dialog: of the skyline.
text: Susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black
text: Speedo suit, Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter.
text: He observes her, but she is unaware of him, however now, as
text: she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection
text: from a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm lost.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: -- Can't seem to escape you today.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Susan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder,
text: points to a stack of towels.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hand me one of those, will you?
text: Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the
text: spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand,
text: can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants
text: the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and
dialog: presents it to Susan.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: You must have something really big
dialog: going on with my father --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: 'Big'?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You appear at his side out-of-the-
dialog: blue, stay at his house, eat dinner
dialog: with his family, it's practically a
dialog: first. You're in the red-hot center
dialog: of big business and I thought you
dialog: were a regular Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I am Joe.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Not the one I met this morning, hit-
dialog: ting on me in as nice a way as I've
dialog: been hit on in a long time, but the
dialog: moment you find out I'm my Dad's
dialog: daughter, you act like a stranger.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That is not my intention.
text: Joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What are your intentions? To make
dialog: little dreams in coffee shops, turn
dialog: a woman's head, and I don't mind
dialog: admitting it was turned, I liked it,
dialog: but ten hours later I feel like a
dialog: fool. I don't get it. You, my
dialog: father, here in this house, the cof-
dialog: fee shop, it's making me upset, and
dialog: I don't like being upset. Who are
dialog: you anyway? And what are you eating?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (mumbles)
dialog: Peanut butter.
text: He finishes the spoonful.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: But it's gone now.
text: He shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in
text: his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate. Susan holds her
text: hand out to him, he places the spoon in it and she sets the
text: spoon on the table with the towels. She watches, fascinat-
text: ed, as Joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his
dialog: spoonful.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You act like you never had peanut
dialog: butter before --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I haven't.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: -- What kind of childhood did you
dialog: have?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Do you love Drew?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Come again?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: When you put your mouth to his,
dialog: Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Drew is none of your damn business.
dialog: Nor is where I put my mouth.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm sorry. Do you live here?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, Joe, I'm swimming here. Then
dialog: I'm going home.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I guess what I'm trying to say is --
dialog: I'd like us to be friends.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I've got plenty of friends.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't have any.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I can see why.
text: She finishes drying herself, drops the towel on a chair, and
text: prepares to leave.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: ...I didn't mean to offend you at
dialog: dinner. I'm not quite at home some-
dialog: times with people. I get busy doing
dialog: - uh - what I do, and I don't seem to
dialog: have developed --
text: He drifts off.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes --?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I have a certain function to per-
dialog: form, and that seems to take all
dialog: of my time. Bu sometimes - uh -
dialog: I speculate - uh - I haven't left
dialog: room for - uh - anything else.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'm sorry to say I know what you're
dialog: saying.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Susan?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Did you know you have a wet spot on
dialog: your shoulder?
text: She glances at her shoulder, he grabs a towel, touches the
text: drops of water, pats them dry, hands her the towel. She
text: flashes a nervous smile.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Goodnight, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Goodnight to you, Susan.
text: Susan steps towards a door, Joe takes a step in the wrong
text: direction, they almost walk into each other. Now she takes
text: a step in another direction, as does Joe, again they almost
dialog: collide.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Shall we dance?
text: Joe is completely puzzled, finally Susan heads for one door,
dialog: Joe for another.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Joe --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I think you want to go to the west
dialog: wing. Through there.
text: Susan indicates yet another door.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Joe redirects himself, goes to the door. As they both are
text: about to exit, Joe and Susan sneak furtive looks at each
text: other across the pool, smile at catching each other's
text: glances. Joe exits. For a moment Susan's eyes remain on
text: the door through which he has gone. Now she grips the towel
text: over her shoulders, the one Joe gave her, pats the same spot
dialog: he did.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NEXT MORNING
text: Parrish, dressed for the day, passes servants busy with
text: their morning tasks, polishing doorknobs, putting away
text: linen, dusting picture frames. He nods and greets them as
text: he strides down the hall, brisk "Good morning"'s to Coyle
dialog: and Luisa.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - MORNING
text: Parrish knocks, waits a courteous moment, opens the door,
text: finds Joe in an elegant shirt and trousers trying to tie his
dialog: tie.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Good morning, Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: How are you? How're you feeling?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: 'Feeling'? I feel fine. How do you
dialog: feel?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well.
dialog: This is crazy. This is the left-
dialog: field thing of all time. What do I
dialog: do? What do I tell my family?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything,
dialog: Bill. You'll ruin the good start we
dialog: had last night. I felt as if I were
dialog: being treated like a person. 'Joe'
dialog: this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile
dialog: - Quince passed me the rolls -- no
dialog: 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of
dialog: those mighty things you seem so
dialog: intent on imparting, but I am cer-
dialog: tain, should you - uh - say - uh -
dialog: who I am - our adventure would end
dialog: abruptly.
text: Parrish regards Joe, the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing
text: of silk stretching across his collarbone.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: But I did so enjoy your family.
text: Parrish is startled, he regards Joe carefully.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What about my family? This 'adven-
dialog: ture' involved only me, right?
text: Silence as Joe considers the point, Parrish quickly crosses
text: to him, undoes the tie, and now begins tying it for him.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Tell you what, you promised that it's
dialog: going to be only me and --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And what?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: And I won't tell anyone who you are.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sounds fair enough.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: It is a deal?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A 'deal'?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You give your word, I give mine --
dialog: that we'll do what we say. It's a
dialog: truth exchanged between two people.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Bill --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You've got a deal.
text: Parrish seems relieved. He has now, with some difficulty,
text: completed the tying of Joe's tie, adjusts it beautifully on
text: Joe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror.
text: Joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the
text: balls of his feet, quite taken.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: This is great!
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Now what do we do?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Shake hands.
text: Joe immediately extends his hand toward Parrish, but
text: Parrish freezes on seeing the hand, stares at it, now takes
text: it. Joe pumps Parrish's hand vigorously, then breaks into a
dialog: broad smile.
scene_heading: EXT. 5TH AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY - DAY
text: Parrish and Joe striding downtown, Joe's jacket fits per-
text: fectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part
text: of the smart Fifth Avenue crowd on the way to work. Parrish
text: senses Joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check-
text: ing out the good-looking women headed for the offices at the
text: top of corporate high-rises.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You know, I got to thinking last
dialog: night -- with you here, and seem-
dialog: ingly occupied, how's your work
dialog: going - uh - elsewhere?
text: A flicker from Joe. He has heard what Parrish has said, his
text: eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue, but
text: he is concentrating on Parrish's words.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: When you were shaving this morning,
dialog: you weren't just shaving, right?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You were hatching ideas, making
dialog: plans, arriving at decisions, right?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I guess so.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So you understand the concept then.
dialog: When you're busy here, your work,
dialog: what your task is, is being executed
dialog: elsewhere.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So you've grasped the idea. Con-
dialog: gratulations. Now multiply it by
dialog: infinity and take it to the depth
dialog: of forever, and you still will
dialog: have barely a glimpse of what I
dialog: am talking about.
text: Parrish falls silent, chewing over Joe's admonition.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Joe --?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes, Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: How about giving a guy a break?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Make an exception?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: There's one to every rule.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not this.
text: They stride on, cutting through the crowd, Joe all at home
text: in his new surrounding, but Parrish just the opposite, un-
text: characteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his
text: lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out:
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: -- I don't deserve this. I'm still
dialog: young, this is not my time --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's what everybody says.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I'm not everybody.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's what everybody says.
text: Parrish is trying to control himself, glances at Joe.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I want to live.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I understand.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: But you can't.
text: A sudden silence between them. Parrish's shoulders appear
dialog: to have stopped slightly, the courage he displayed at rais-
dialog: ing these issues has vanished.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What's it like?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What's it like where I'm going?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Can you keep a secret?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So can I.
text: They turn into Parrish's office building.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY
text: As Parrish and Joe enter, Parrish is hailed by JAIME, the
dialog: Elevator Starter.
speaker_heading: JAIME
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Good morning, Jaime.
speaker_heading: JAIME
dialog: Knight's Reward in the 4th at
dialog: Calder --
text: A bemused Parrish walks on, Joe beside him, Jaime pursuing
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: JAIME (cont'd)
dialog: -- A closer in today with cheap
dialog: speed. The colt will come from the
dialog: clouds and boom! Fifty-eight dollar
dialog: horse. I get you down, Mr. Parrish,
dialog: just say the word.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I'm sorry, not today, Jaime.
text: Parrish and Joe arrive at the bank of elevators. Jaime,
text: back at his post, hits a button.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: You know, everyday I've walked into
dialog: this building, Jaime gives me a
dialog: horse.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: I wonder if any of them won.
text: The elevator materializes, Parrish and Joe step on.
scene_heading: INT. PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS, OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN - DAY
text: Parrish and Joe emerge from the executive elevator, Jennifer
text: is waiting as usual with her pad, "Good morning"s, etc. As
text: Parrish strides down the hall, Joe right beside him, he passes
text: instructions back to Jennifer who, scribbling, hurries along
dialog: behind them.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: -- And call my family, I'd like them
dialog: to come over for dinner tonight.
speaker_heading: JENIFER
dialog: Didn't the family get together last
dialog: night --?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (remonstrating, gently)
dialog: Jennifer.
speaker_heading: JENIFER
dialog: Of course, Mr. Parrish. Right away.
text: Jennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as
text: Parrish arrives at the door to the Board Room.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: Perhaps you would like to wait in my
dialog: office --?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What I'm trying to say is this is a
dialog: Board meeting and you are not a mem-
dialog: ber of the Board.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm sure you'll see to it that it
dialog: won't be a problem.
text: Parrish hesitates, nods, conceding the point, reaches for
text: the doorknob.
scene_heading: INT. BOARD ROOM, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY
text: Parrish enters, Joe following right behind him. A euphony
dialog: of "Good morning"'s from the various members of the Board,
text: including Quince. Everyone sits when Parrish does but Joe,
text: right at home, spots a tray of refreshments: coffee, pas-
text: tries, he heads for them.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (to the Board)
dialog: -- This is Joe Black, a personal
dialog: associate of mine - uh - he'll be
dialog: joining us today. I know it's --
dialog: uh -- unusual, and my apologies --
dialog: and Drew -- uh -- carry on.
text: Immediately indications of surprise on Board members' faces at
text: Parrish bringing in an 'observer', Drew's reaction guarded
dialog: but intense.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (after a moment, to
dialog: Joe)
dialog: Nice to see you. I didn't expect
dialog: you, but certainly you can't get
dialog: enough of a good thing.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to the Board)
dialog: The Board of Parrish Communications -
dialog: is hereby called to order. Our sole
dialog: order of business is an acceptance
dialog: of John Bontecou's generous offer
dialog: and --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: Do you have any more of these deli-
dialog: cious cookies?
text: A hushed silence at the inappropriateness of Joe's inter-
dialog: ruption.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: And a cup of tea. With milk, I
dialog: think. I'd like to try it English-
text: style. Yes, a cup of tea with milk.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Anything else, Mr. Black? How about
dialog: some water?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why yes, thank you.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hot or cold.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Cold.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: And a glass.
dialog: Drew indicates to the Board's Stenographer to arrange Joe's
dialog: refreshments.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (quietly, indicating a
dialog: chair)
dialog: Would you like to sit down, Joe?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Joe sits.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: To review -- we're really crossing
dialog: the 't's and dotting the 'i's here.
dialog: Bill had a great and conclusive
dialog: meeting with John Bontecou yester-
dialog: day, all that remains for us is to
dialog: put it to a vote.
text: Smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from
dialog: the Board at Drew's news.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (emptily)
dialog: Thank you, Drew.
text: Parrish takes a moment, draws himself up to say something
text: official then stops himself, what follows is spontaneous,
text: reflective, deeply felt.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Umm -- I did enjoy -- or rather I
dialog: was interested in meeting John yes-
dialog: terday -- impressive... I suppose...
dialog: But it did get me to thinking. I
dialog: started in this business because
dialog: this is what I wanted to do. I knew
dialog: I wasn't going to write the Great
dialog: American Novel, but I also knew
dialog: there was more to life than buying
dialog: something for a dollar and selling
dialog: it for two. I wanted to give the
dialog: news to the world, and I wanted to
dialog: give it unvarnished. The more we
dialog: all know about each other, the
dialog: greater the chance we will survive.
dialog: Sure, I want to make a profit, you
dialog: can't exist without one but John
dialog: Bontecou is all profit. If we give
dialog: him license to absorb Parrish
dialog: Communications, and he has his eye
dialog: on a few others after us, we'll be
dialog: appointing him to the position he
dialog: craves -- Gatekeeper. In order to
dialog: reach the world you will have to go
dialog: through John Bontecou. And not only
dialog: will you have to pay him to do this,
dialog: far more expensive, you'll have to
dialog: agree with him. Reporting the news
dialog: is a privilege and a responsibility
dialog: and it is not exploitable. Parrish
dialog: Communications has earned this priv-
dialog: ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy
dialog: it. As your chairman, I urge you to
dialog: agree this company is not for sale.
text: A silence, everybody shifts, the Board is in shock, Drew is
text: trying to maintain his balance.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: ...Sounds like you're not leaving
dialog: much room for discussion.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (to the Board)
dialog: Sorry. I know it looks like I'm
dialog: reversing my field.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: That's your privilege, Bill. But
dialog: given our needs, given the absolute
dialog: necessity for growth, given the fu-
dialog: ture, the truth is... joining John
dialog: Bontecou is every bit as certain as -
dialog: Death and Taxes.
dialog: Joe interjects:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: 'Death and Taxes'?
dialog: After a moment.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: "Death and Taxes"?
dialog: Another moment.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What an odd pairing.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Of whom?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: It doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Then why did you bring it up?
dialog: Drew regards Joe.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You're not familiar with the phrase,
dialog: "In this world, nothing is certain
dialog: but Death and Taxes"?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I am now.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Glad I could be of some help.
text: The Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by
text: his presence, they cast meaningful glances at Parrish, Drew
text: coolly grasps the irritation of the members. Parrish breaks
dialog: the silence.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Shall we adjourn?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: But the matter's still on the table,
dialog: Bill --
text: EDWARD SLOANE, a contemporary of Parrish's, has been warily
text: silent, but extremely observant. Protective of Parrish, and
text: sensing his burgeoning difficulty, he interrupts:
speaker_heading: SLOANE
dialog: Why don't we let it rest for the
dialog: moment? Give it some air?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Well said, Eddie. Mr. Black, shall
dialog: we?
text: Joe rises.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: Those cookies were excellent.
text: He exits with Parrish, the door closes behind them. A BABBLE
dialog: of disturbed reactions from the Board.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Who is that guy?
dialog: Drew grabs a telephone:
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: Felicia?
speaker_heading: FELICIA (O.S.)
dialog: Yes, sir?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Get me a Field Background check on
dialog: Joe Black. Litigations. Bankrupt-
dialog: cies. Credit ratings. The works.
dialog: Got it?
text: Drew hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Parrish enters, Joe right on his heels. They booth stop,
text: Parrish regards him.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: -- What's the deal here? Are you
dialog: going to be breathing down my neck
dialog: right 'til the very end?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't understand.
text: Parrish tries to gather himself.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: ...I'd like to be alone for a while.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Are you sad, Bill?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yes, I am. There's a research lib-
dialog: rary on the fourth floor. Why don't
dialog: you go down and read some magazines?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're not thinking of going some-
dialog: where, are you, Bill?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Joe, could I ask you to take a walk?
dialog: Buy a tie or something. I know I'll
dialog: be seeing you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Of course.
text: But Joe doesn't move.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (prompting)
dialog: Now I'd like to be alone.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh. Okay.
text: Parrish reaches into his pocket and hands Joe some cash.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Here -- this will hold you for a
dialog: while.
text: Joe stares at the money as Parrish shows him the door.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: You know about money, don't you?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It can't buy happiness?
text: Parrish opens the door.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of
dialog: the city.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No thank you, Bill. I can manage.
dialog: Joe goes.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM AREA, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Susan is busy giving instructions to a Nurse, a patient on
text: an examining table beside them. As she finishes, she
text: suddenly notices Joe down the corridor in the reception
text: area. She is startled for the moment, quickly makes a last
text: notation, hands a chart to the Nurse and heads down the
dialog: corridor.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Joe --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How nice you look. Is that your
dialog: uniform?
text: Susan regards him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Why did you come here?
text: Joe doesn't have an answer.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Are you ill?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh goodness, no.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Then why are you here, Joe?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I came to see you.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't have any time to see you
dialog: now. I'm doing grand rounds and
dialog: then I'm examining back-to-back
dialog: patients until dinner and then --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Very well, I'll watch.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Watch me do what?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Whatever you do.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That's impossible. I'm a doctor,
dialog: I'm --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And I'll be a visitor.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Patients have visitors, not doctors.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't mind --
text: Visible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid-
text: thirties, TEENA, an arm around her mother, EASTER, who is
text: holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in her seat,
dialog: in great pain.
speaker_heading: TEENA
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: Miss? Miss Doctor?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Just a minute, please.
speaker_heading: TEENA
dialog: Please. My momma's sicker'n he
dialog: is.
text: Easter looks up and sees Joe. She abruptly becomes still,
text: eyes wide, as if sudden recognition.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: Obeah.
speaker_heading: TEENA
dialog: No, Momma.
text: But Easter just stares at Joe, fearful.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: Obeah mon. I gonna die.
speaker_heading: TEENA
dialog: Momma, stop it. Is just a man.
text: Joe looks at Easter, curiously.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (to Teena)
dialog: What's obeah?
speaker_heading: TEENA
dialog: Bad spirit. She just all fever, she
dialog: don' mean nothin'. Please help us?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Have you filled out the insurance
dialog: forms?
text: Teena shakes her hand anxiously. Joe leans forward to
text: Easter and speaks softly in perfect, lilting West Indian
dialog: dialect.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No obeah, sister. No duppy, no
dialog: jumbie. Evera ting gon' be irey.
text: Susan and Teena both look at him, astonished. Easter's
text: fearful gaze remains locked on him.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: Go wi' de doctor lady. Momma be
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: Don' leave!?
speaker_heading: TEENA
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Momma.
text: Susan leads Teena away. Easter is riveted on Joe.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: (with certainty)
dialog: Obeah.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Obeah evil. I not evil.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: What you then?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I from dat nex' place.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: You wait here'n to take us? Like
dialog: you bus driver to dere?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No, no. I on holiday.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: (looks around, dubious)
dialog: Some spot you pick.
text: She winces with pain, gasping.
speaker_heading: EASTER (cont'd)
dialog: Pain is bad.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: Make it go 'way.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Doctor lady make it irey.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: Not dis pain. Dis pain tru an' tru.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Can't, sistah.
speaker_heading: EASTER

dialog: Can, mistah. Take me to dat nex'
dialog: place.
text: Joe regards Easter, a long moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not time yet.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: Make it time.
text: Joe shakes his head, a firm no. But when he looks and speaks
text: to Easter again, it is with concern and even regret.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Can't feel wi' de way tings gotta
dialog: be, Easter.
text: Susan and Teena return with an Orderly and a wheelchair for
dialog: Easter.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: TEENA
dialog: Come now, Momma.
text: Easter is helped into the wheelchair. She looks pleadingly
text: at Joe. The Orderly starts to wheel her away. Joe stays him,
text: putting his hand on Easter's arm.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Close your eyes, Easter.
text: She does, her pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: Soon.
text: He takes his hand away, and the Orderly wheels Easter off.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (to Teena)
dialog: Go with her. I'll be right there.
text: Teena goes. Joe remains his normal voice.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: She's in a great deal of pain.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes.
text: Susan regards Joe, puzzled.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Have you spent a lot of time in the
dialog: islands?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Some.
dialog: Joe shifts.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: I - uh - I - realize now - uh - my
dialog: being here - um - your patient --
dialog: this is not really appropriate --
dialog: and I - uh --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't apologize. There's nothing
dialog: to be sorry for -- every hospital
dialog: should have someone like you.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Well...I'm glad you came.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thank you. I'm so very glad to be
dialog: here.
dialog: Another awkward silence.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: I guess you're busy --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes.
text: She doesn't move, they search for words.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, I could come again some other
dialog: time.
text: Susan regards him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Joe, I'm with Drew.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: Not now.
text: Susan smiles gently.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: Don't you want me to come again...?
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Be sorry for nothing.
dialog: Another moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes. Well...thank you, Joe.
text: Susan turns to go, hesitates.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Good-bye, Susan.
text: Susan waves softly to him, heads down the hall, glances back
text: once to see Joe has not moved, is watching her depart.
scene_heading: INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
text: Jennifer shows Joe in, Parrish is deep in thought, beside
text: him a meal laid out beautifully on his desk with linen and
text: silver, but untouched.
text: Joe is more abstracted than usual, he is starting at
dialog: Parrish's food.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Are you going to eat your lunch
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: It's all yours.
text: Joe starts eating, Parrish watches him, somewhat fascinated,
text: Joe's chewing has improved.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Good?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Excellent. What is it?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro. A
dialog: little Coleman's mustard.
text: Joe takes another big bite.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Truly - uh - splendid.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Glad you like it. My wife turned me
dialog: onto cold lamb sandwiches. Joan --
dialog: that was my wife --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (familiarly)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy
dialog: as roast beef, not as boring as
dialog: chicken. She knew stuff like that.
text: Silence, Parrish getting lost in his memories.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: -- Everything reminds me of her --
dialog: there isn't a day that goes by that
dialog: I don't think about her -- One day
dialog: she was here. The next day she was
dialog: gone. What are you going to do? --
dialog: I guess you've heard all this a
dialog: trillion times before.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And more.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Why didn't you stop me?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well...I don't know.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: How was it the first time you met
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I thought you'd heard a trillion
dialog: times --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: This part I'm interested in.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: She had on this little blue suit --
dialog: with a little white collar that had
dialog: little red piping on it --
text: Joe is riveted on Parrish ow, Parrish aware of him, has
dialog: paused.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: You could have put her under glass
dialog: and I would have just stood and
dialog: looked at her. But when she spoke
dialog: -- I loved the sound of her voice
dialog: and her laugh --
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: -- I couldn't get enough of her --
dialog: and gradually -- or maybe it wasn't
dialog: gradually -- I realized I couldn't
dialog: live without her.
text: A KNOCK, the door opens and Drew enters, looks at Parrish,
text: then at Joe, stands poised in the doorway.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: May I interrupting?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to joe)
dialog: 'Just kidding'?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Sit down, Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Before I do --
dialog: (glances at Joe)
dialog: I was hoping we might be alone,
dialog: Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Joe and I have no secrets from each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: How nice for you both.
text: Drew takes a moment, then plunges in.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: Bill, pardon my candor, but I was
dialog: confounded by your decision this
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I was hired, you told me, to help
dialog: bring Parrish Communications into
dialog: the 21st Century. This merger is
dialog: the vehicle --
dialog: Joe interrupts:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Perhaps a merger is a way to bring
dialog: Bill's company into the 21st cen-
dialog: tury. And perhaps it isn't. And
dialog: perhaps cheating on your French
dialog: Philosophers exam at The Groton
dialog: School was an expedient way to get
dialog: your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't.
dialog: Be that as it may, Drew, a question
dialog: can often be argued both ways.
text: Drew is stunned.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Joe, cut it out. And you too, Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: I thought this was practically a
dialog: done deal --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Well now it's undone, okay? Forget
dialog: Bontecou! Scrub him! I'm tired of
dialog: his fancy name and his fancy offer.
dialog: I'm not going for it.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Okay.
text: Drew heads for the door, turns around.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Can I invite myself to dinner
dialog: tonight?
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Susan and I had ticket for the
dialog: Knicks game. But she said you
dialog: guys were getting together --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Dinner? Absolutely.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: Damn decent of you.
dialog: Drew exits.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why, at this juncture, are you
dialog: letting yourself be so concerned
dialog: by business matters?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't want anybody buying up my
dialog: life's work and turning it into
dialog: something it wasn't meant to be. A
dialog: man wants to leave something behind.
dialog: And he wants it left behind the way
dialog: he made it. And he wants it to be
dialog: run the way he run it -- with a sense
dialog: of honor, of dedication, of truth.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: And I don't need your goddamn permis-
dialog: sion either! You! Drew! I don't
dialog: need anyone to tell me how to run my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Easy, Bill. You'll give yourself a
dialog: heart attack and ruin my vacation.
scene_heading: INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
text: The skyline glitters through the terrace windows. The hour
text: is before dinner, Coyle and Luisa weave seamlessly among the
text: family, offering hors d'oeuvres and drinks on a tray.
text: Allison and Susan together by a piano; Parrish, Quince and a
text: distracted Joe are gathered near the terrace. Joe's eyes
text: are on Susan across the room. Her eyes flicker towards him,
text: aware of his gaze.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (to Susan)
dialog: ...We're never all together two
dialog: nights in a row. Maybe Christmas,
dialog: Thanksgiving, that's it. What's
dialog: going on?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Nothing's going on. Maybe he
dialog: doesn't want to be alone. He's go-
dialog: ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: ...I don't know, Daddy seems funny
dialog: to me. Ever since Joe showed. It's
dialog: like he dropped from the clouds...
text: Drew enters. He nuzzles Susan's neck, out of the corner of
text: her eye she sees Joe still observing them.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: ...When Daddy walked in with him, he
dialog: couldn't even remember his name. Now
dialog: he's his house guest. And you know
dialog: how he hates house guests. What is
dialog: going on?
text: Drew, whose eyes have also been on Joe across the room, turns
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Susan and Allison)
dialog: Good question.
text: Allison sees Susan's eyes flicker over towards Joe.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: -- But he does seem very nice.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Over at the terrace, Quince buttonholes Parrish, Joe stand-
dialog: ing by.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: ...I read you all the way on the
dialog: Bontecou thing, and I know where
dialog: you're coming from. And I'm with
dialog: you a hundred and one percent.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Thank you, Quince.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: But I've got to tell you, if mergers
dialog: are in the wild, I've got some great
dialog: prospects I've developed. I want to
dialog: talk to you about them next week.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Next week?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Yeah. Or the week after.
text: Quince sees Parrish hesitate.
speaker_heading: QUINCE (cont'd)
dialog: No good?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No, anything is possible.
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: It's up to Joe.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Joe, you don't know how glad I am
dialog: you're aboard. Anybody who can take
dialog: some of the weight off the old man,
dialog: I'm in his corner.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's very gracious of you, Quince.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: No problem. I'll leave you two
dialog: alone. I can tell you guys have
dialog: something on the fire --
text: An excited Quince drains his drink and heads for Drew as
text: Allison appears.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Did you know twenty-six members of
dialog: your rifle company are coming?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: From the Korean War.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Conflict, honey. Korean Conflict.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Whatever it was, they'll be here.
dialog: We sent out invitations to everyone,
dialog: plane tickets included -- the RSVP's
dialog: are amazing. A few of them we didn't
dialog: hear from, and some of them are dead,
dialog: of course --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: You know, we're going to give this
dialog: party for you whether you like it or
dialog: not.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I like it. I like it. I'm sorry I
dialog: don't seem more appreciative.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (resignedly)
dialog: That's okay, Daddy.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Across the room, Quince has pulled Drew aside:
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: ...I know you're down, but you know
dialog: when you're down, Drew, there's no
dialog: place to go but up.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Thanks, Quince.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Never mind Bontecou. I've got some
dialog: other merger possibilities up my
dialog: sleeve, and I'm putting them to see
dialog: old man.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: We'll do it together. I'll clue you
dialog: in. Timing's got to be right. The
dialog: old man says it's up to Joe.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: 'It's up to Joe'? Those were his
dialog: words?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: 'It's up to Joe', huh?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Yeah, that's what he said.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Well, that's very interesting.
text: Drew gazes intently over at Joe who is crossing to Susan,
text: for the moment by herself near the piano.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: I thought so, too. Joe's a neat
dialog: guy.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yeah. Neat.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Joe approaches Susan.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I wanted to apologize, Susan --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I thought you said 'Be sorry for
dialog: nothing'.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, now I am sorry. For intruding
dialog: on you this afternoon.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It wasn't an intrusion. And if it
dialog: was, it turned out to be welcome.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I appreciate you --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I mean I appreciate that.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And I appreciate you, too.
text: A moment between them.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: You do? Well, thank you very much.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Drew crosses over to Parrish.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I was a little abrupt with you this
dialog: afternoon, Drew. Forgive me. I want
dialog: you to know I value your advice.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: As much as Joe's?
text: Parrish doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: Who is this man? He's giving
dialog: ubiquitous a bad name.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You're competitive soul, Drew.
dialog: That's what makes you a great addi-
dialog: tion to the money. Joe is just...
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: For how long? And why?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Please. Don't worry about him. And
dialog: above all, don't antagonize him.
text: Drew glances over at Joe.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Boss's orders, huh? I'm great at
dialog: following them. And I think I'll
dialog: start right now.
text: Allison calls out from the other side of the room:
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Dinner's ready, everybody!
text: A BUZZ as Coyle opens the doors to the dining room and the
text: family files in, Drew lingering behind with Joe.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I have a confession to make to you,
dialog: Joe.
text: Joe just smiles in response.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: Do you want to hear it?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Well, I'm going to tell you anyway.
dialog: I did cheat on that exam at Groton.
dialog: But so did twenty-six other guys,
dialog: and nobody ever mentioned it until
dialog: today. And I'm expecting you won't
dialog: mention it again. I don't know who
dialog: you are and where you're getting
dialog: your information, but I'm willing to
dialog: pretend I did not hear it, and let
dialog: bygones be bygones. But can I tell
dialog: you something else, it'd be nice to
dialog: see the big guy without you next to
dialog: him. What are you, his shadow? Do
dialog: you hold his dick for him when he
dialog: goes to take a leak? You know some-
dialog: times somebody would like a few min-
dialog: utes alone with W.P. That means
dialog: without you. Okay, pal? Let's eat.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Everyone eating silently but looks are exchanged, glances
text: averted, Allison notices Susan and Joe looking at each
text: other, Drew observes Parrish watching Joe, Quince, on the
dialog: other hand, just eats.
text: Breaking the silence, Parrish chinks his glass, stands.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: -- I - uh - want to thank you all
dialog: for coming - uh - my family --
text: Everyone at the table is all attention.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: -- Allison and Quince, Susan -- and
dialog: the other members --
text: He glances at Joe, stops.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: -- I'm so happy when we can get
dialog: together -- I mean I know you all
dialog: have busy lives --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Look who's talking.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (a laugh)
dialog: Yeah, speak for yourself.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Anyway -- I remember when you were
dialog: little girls --
text: An awkward pause. Quince chooses to fill the silence.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: I love little girls --
text: Allison elbows him.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: And now you're all grown up -- and
dialog: I'm - uh - um --
text: Parrish struggles to keep his emotions in check, Drew
text: clocking his behavior very carefully.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: I had some words all prepared but
dialog: now I've forgotten them - uh - um -
dialog: wait a minute.
text: Silence, everyone waiting for Parrish to proceed.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Uh, it's gone...um -- it was on the
dialog: tip of my tongue.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It'll come back, Daddy.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Will it?...
text: Parrish looking around, searching for words he will not find.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Anyway, I'd like to go on but...
text: He hesitates, drifts into silence.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: Daddy, you could sit down if you
dialog: wanted to.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: There is so much I would like to say
dialog: -- but I can't --
dialog: (another moment)
dialog: So I better sit down. Carry on,
dialog: everybody.
text: He sits, then immediately stands up again.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: One other thing -- why don't we all
dialog: have dinner again tomorrow night?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Dinner? Again?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (with great sincerity)
dialog: No.
dialog: The word lands with effect, Susan and Allison have heard it
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: We'll be here.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: You bet.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
text: With bells on.
text: The guests try to return to their food, Susan is the most
text: concerned about Parrish's lapse, she does not say anything
text: but Drew next to her senses her empathy and, in something of
text: a display, gives her a pro forma hug. Joe has observed
text: every instant of Drew's performance, his anxiety is palpable
text: when Coyle leans over to serve him, offering a tray of a
text: roast that has been carved.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Coyle)
dialog: I would prefer some peanut butter.
speaker_heading: COYLE
dialog: How would you like that, sir? On
dialog: some kind of toast?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Toast? No...just the butter.
speaker_heading: COYLE
dialog: Right away.
text: Coyle heads for the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Why do you love peanut butter so
dialog: much?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (intimately)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I adore things like that....food I
dialog: can't do without. Don't you?
text: Joe is locked on Susan, it is as if there is nobody else in the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It comforts you, doesn't it?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (captivated)
dialog: Yes...I've found that it does.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Mind if I throw up?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (admonishing gently)
dialog: Please, Drew.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Susan)
dialog: I'm very concerned about the woman
dialog: you attended to today.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I am, too.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Has her pain abated?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: We're doing what we can for her.
dialog: But it doesn't look good.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Who are we talking about?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Susan)
dialog: But I know she's grateful for the
dialog: care you're giving her.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Is this a state secret or are we
dialog: being excluded just for the fun of
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: Susan's patient is whom we are
dialog: talking about.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Joe visited the hospital today.
text: Parrish's head swivels to Joe.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Did he? That's more than we get to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Well, maybe next time Joe goes,
dialog: he'll take us along.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Perhaps you could remind me.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I'll make a note of it. Anything
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: I'd like to come, too. See Susan
dialog: strut her stuff.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You're on, Quin-cee. Destination
dialog: Hospital. Joe, you'll be the Tour
dialog: Guide. Okay? How's that sound to
dialog: you?
text: Silence. Parrish regards Joe, then Susan, his face reflects
text: a sudden concern with their relationship.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Susan is a wonderful doctor.
scene_heading: INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: After dinner, the family and guests file back in from the
text: dining room, Drew alongside Parrish.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I have to go, Bill -- it's been a
dialog: helluva day. Need a few minutes to
dialog: sort everything out.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Sure.
text: Drew peels off, heads for the foyer and front door, Susan
text: follows him.
dialog: Parrish corners Joe.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Why did you go to the hospital?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You were just curious?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I guess...
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: About Susan?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I wouldn't put it that way.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What way would you put it?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You tell me, Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: How about you telling me? When I
dialog: ask a simple question, I expect a
dialog: straight answer. That's what I'm
dialog: used to. Anybody who doesn't give
dialog: it to me, I fire.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Are you going to fire me, Bill?
text: Silence, Parrish is at a loss.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - NIGHT
text: Drew is putting on his coat, Susan with him, a tension between
text: them, a heavy silence finally broken.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: ...See you tomorrow night.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Include me out. I've had enough of
dialog: the conversations.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You don't mean that. You wouldn't
dialog: disappoint Daddy --
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Daddy'll do fine. Besides, he's got
dialog: Joe.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: And so do you.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Drew, you're out of line.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: That may be. But I don't like the
dialog: fucker. I don't like the way he
dialog: looks at you and talks to you. And
dialog: vice versa.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Sorry, but I like the way he looks
dialog: and talks to me. And vice versa.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: No, not okay. I thought we had a
dialog: good thing going here.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: It shows you never know.
dialog: Silence, neither knows how to continue.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well... goodnight.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yeah. Goodnight.
text: Drew goes, Susan turns to find out at the far end of the foyer,
text: he's been observing them. She walks up to him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: How long have you been standing
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't like the way Drew spoken to
dialog: you. But I feel better about it now
dialog: because of the way you spoke back.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Tell me about yourself, Joe. Who
dialog: you are. What you're doing with my
dialog: father.
text: Susan's directness has caught him by surprise, Joe blinks.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: So you're not going to tell me?
text: Joe remains silent, rendered extremely anxious by Susan's
dialog: inquiries.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: You're married, aren't you?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Because guys who never say anything
dialog: about themselves are always married.
text: Joe doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: So you are married.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, I'm not.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Girlfriend?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Gay?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No.
text: Susan comes closer to Joe.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Then tell me, Joe, how come a man
dialog: as attractive, intelligent, well-
dialog: spoken ,diffident in the most sed-
dialog: uctive way, and yet powerful, is all
dialog: alone in this world?
text: Joe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted
dialog: by Susan.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sorry, I don't want to pry and
dialog: you don't want to tell me. So let's
dialog: leave it a mystery. That's the way
dialog: you want it, isn't it?
text: Susan takes another step closer to Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thank you, I appreciate that.
text: They are inches apart now, the smell of each other surrounds
text: them, a heaviness to the moment, now Joe turns to head up the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: To bed.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (suddenly fragile)
dialog: 'To bed'?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes. I'm tired.
text: He excuses himself with an ineffable gesture, now climbs the
text: stairs, Susan watches him disappear.
text: She turns back into the salon just as Allison and Quince are
text: exiting, "good-byes" all around. Susan is left alone now
text: with Parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: That was wonderful.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yeah, it's good to get together.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Do you mind if I raise a little
dialog: caution flag?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Raise away.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What is the nature of your interest
dialog: in Joe?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, remember how you told me about
dialog: "lightning striking"? The nature of
dialog: it's in there somewhere.
text: Parrish drops another cube of ice in his drink, takes his
dialog: time before answering.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I won't say you may be getting onto
dialog: shaken ground --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Then what will you say?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't think this is the lightning
dialog: you are looking for. Drew's a good
dialog: man. I know I didn't seem to be
text: completely in his corner before, but
dialog: I've come to appreciate --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo-
dialog: ten? What's going on?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: When you say 'nothing' that way,
dialog: it's not nothing.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Then what is it?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It's something.
text: She kisses him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: G'night, Daddy. See you tomorrow.
dialog: This is getting interesting.
dialog: She goes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE CARLYLE HOTEL - NEXT DAY
text: A large suite, room service carts creaking with pots of
text: coffee and half-eaten pastries. The Board of Parrish
text: Communications is gathered, absent are Parrish and Quince.
text: Felicia, Drew's secretary, takes notes.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: ...I know you're all as uncomfor-
dialog: table as I am to be meeting without
dialog: Bill, but I got a call last night
dialog: from John Bontecou. Not only is he
dialog: still interested, he is sweetening
dialog: his offer.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Although it pains me to say it, in
dialog: my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with
dialog: us peremptorily in dismissing any
dialog: deal with Bontecou. Therefore, I'm
dialog: sorry to say that if we are to exam-
dialog: ine this new offer responsibly as
dialog: the Board of Directors of Parrish
dialog: Communications, we must do so with-
dialog: out its Chairman.
dialog: (another moment)
dialog: Oh yes, there is one additional
dialog: element: Bontecou is so anxious to
dialog: get us, he said he'd take Parrish
dialog: Communications with our Chairman or
dialog: without.
text: The Board falls silent. Sloane, a peer of Parrish's,
text: fidgets. Drew milks the moment.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'D)
dialog: It's no surprise if I suggest to you
dialog: that the Bill Parrish we know is not
dialog: the Bill Parrish you saw yesterday.
dialog: You heard that speech -- some strange
dialog: emotional rationale to buttress a
dialog: knee-jerk rejection of a legitimate
dialog: offer. Does it not strike you that
dialog: something is possibly affecting this
dialog: man's judgement? More specifically
dialog: -- his judgement to make a critical
dialog: business decision?
text: Silence, the Board clocking Drew's argument.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'D)
dialog: It's not pleasant to say the follow-
dialog: ing, but I would be remiss, in this
dialog: crisis, if I did not. When we pre-
dialog: sent Bill with the improved Bontecou
dialog: offer, and if he refuses to let us
dialog: consider it -- once more makes an
dialog: adamant or emotional rejection -- we
dialog: will have no choice but to seek an
dialog: alternative.
speaker_heading: SLOANE
dialog: And what would that be?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Bill's birthday is the day after
dialog: tomorrow. There is a provisory by-
dialog: law in our charter. Per the discre-
dialog: tion of the Board, Corporate off-
dialog: icers can be retired at age sixty-
dialog: five.
speaker_heading: SLOANE
dialog: You're taking this too far, Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Am I not obligated to?
text: Drew leans over to Felicia, speaks quietly and she leaves
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: How did this all come about? Crisis
dialog: -- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com-
dialog: pany, crisis for us. I came about
dialog: with the arrival on the scene of --
dialog: Mr. Joe Black. Mr. Joe who? Joe
dialog: Black. He attends our Board meet-
dialog: int, he sleeps at Bill's house, re-
text: sides in his office. Never leaves
dialog: his side. And, in my opinion, is
dialog: always in his ear. Telling him what
dialog: to do and Bill is listening. Who is
dialog: Joe Black? What is his relationship
dialog: to Bill Parrish? And most important,
dialog: what is behind his influence on our
dialog: Chairman?
speaker_heading: SLOANE
dialog: You're building this thing up too
dialog: much, Drew. He's had advisors be-
dialog: fore. Nobody tells Bill what to do.
text: The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, sur-
text: prised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Thank you for coming.
speaker_heading: SLOANE
dialog: Hello, Quince.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Hi, Ed, hi folks, I didn't know
dialog: everybody was going to be here, what
dialog: a nice surprise. What's the big
dialog: confab?
speaker_heading: SLOANE
dialog: (acidly)
text: This is a secret meeting.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Quince)
dialog: I hope you'll respect its nature --
dialog: What we're trying to do here is
dialog: gather our thoughts -- in light of
dialog: Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer
dialog: -- and make an appropriate presenta-
dialog: tion to him as to how we think the
dialog: company might proceed. Won't you
dialog: share with our Board the information
dialog: you gave me last night?
text: Quince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind.
text: He nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the
dialog: Board.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got
dialog: good news. As I was telling Drew,
dialog: I've been making a little hay while
dialog: the Bontecou sun was shining -- two,
dialog: possibly three new and boiling hot
dialog: prospects for merger.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: How did Bill react to the leads
dialog: you've developed?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: He was interested.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (prompting)
dialog: -- But he was concerned about the
dialog: timing?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: The timing -- yes. He says it's up
dialog: to Joe.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: 'It's up to Joe'?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: That's what he said.
text: Quince, having dispensed his information, looks proudly
text: around at the Board members. They are stunned, Sloane in
text: shock. Drew is absolutely still, letting Quince's words
dialog: sink in.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Parrish, Joe, Susan, Allison and Quince are seated at the
text: table, dessert plates in front of them, coffee cups beside.
text: Allison and Susan's eyes are on Parrish, looking for some
dialog: clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet
text: again. Parrish is somewhat within himself, but he peeks
text: over his demi-tasse cup at Joe, Parrish aware of Joe's
text: heightened interest in Susan, and Susan's reciprocation.
text: Coyle enters carrying two imposing stemmed silver trays with
text: cakes on them, Luisa follows with one other. They set them
text: down in front of Parrish.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Annie made them.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Who's Annie?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: From La Rosette, only the greatest
dialog: pastry chef in America.
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: This is orange, from real Seville
dialog: oranges. Lemon, on a mille-feuille
dialog: crust, a little on the fanciful.
dialog: And a while, nothing like a good old
dialog: white cake, vanilla, with Angel food
text: but some maroons shavings thrown in.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't like cake.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: It's for the party, Dad --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Oh, the goddam party --
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: 'Goddam party'!
text: Allison bursts into tears.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: (to Quince)
dialog: Did you hear that?
text: Quince quickly slashes a piece, takes a huge bite.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: This is great, honey. The orange.
dialog: Has it got a little vodka in it?
dialog: Like that Finnish stuff, orange
dialog: vodka --
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Put your lips around this one, Bill.
dialog: It's out of this world.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No thank you, Quince.
dialog: (to Allison)
dialog: I'm sorry, honey. I'm no good at
dialog: this. Why don't you choose whatever
dialog: cake you like?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I knew you were going to say that.
dialog: Tito Puente. The old platoon. Now
dialog: the cake. You just don't care. Why
dialog: did I do this? I should have my head
dialog: examined. I'm trying to throw the
dialog: party for the century for my father -
dialog: and you know what -- he doesn't give
dialog: a shit.
text: She bursts into tears all over again.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: But he does give a shit. Don't you,
dialog: Bill?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yeah, I give a shit.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: See. There. What'd I tell you?
text: Joe watches as Quince dabs at Allison's tears with a napkin.
speaker_heading: QUINCE (cont'd)
dialog: Feel better?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Yeah, but --
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: But what?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: What will I tell Annie?
text: Parrish forks a bit of a cake.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: This one.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: The vodka. What'd I tell you?
text: Quince puts a reassuring arm around Allison, she seems to
dialog: relax now, Joe has been a keen observer of what has trans-
dialog: pired between husband and wife, between man and woman, a
dialog: sense that he has taken in the virtue of such a relation-
dialog: ship.
scene_heading: INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: After dinner, Parrish, Allison and Susan are gathered to-
text: gether. At the bar on the other side of the room, Joe
text: watches as Quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Quince)
dialog: Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth
dialog: leading killer of adult Western
dialog: males.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: I didn't know that.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: On the other hand, Winston Churchill
dialog: drank a bottle of cognac a day and
dialog: lived until he was ninety-one.
dialog: After a moment.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: You're an original, Joe. A little
dialog: hard to figure, maybe...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And you're a nice man, Quince.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're welcome.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Drew appears unannounced in the doorway, exchanges a tense
text: glance with Susan, then heads straight for Parrish who seems
text: surprised to see him.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Sorry to intrude, Bill, but we've
dialog: got a bit of a crisis downtown --
dialog: it's not something we could talk
dialog: about on the phone.
text: Parrish takes Drew aside.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: The Board's real unhappy, Pappy --
dialog: they felt you dealt with them pre-
dialog: emptorily, you never gave them a
dialog: chance to speak --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What is there to say? They know
dialog: what John Bontecou is -- and if they
dialog: didn't, they know now.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yes, you made your feeling abun-
dialog: dantly clear. Now they want to do
dialog: the same with theirs.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What are their feelings?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: If I read this Board right now, they
dialog: want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Over my dead body.
text: Parrish's burgeoning anger has now gotten the attention of
text: Joe, Susan, Quince and Allison.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What do you think the Board is going
dialog: to say when I tell them that?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: With all due respect, you damn well
dialog: better care because if you try to
dialog: stonewall them again, there'll be
text: blood on the floor.
text: Silence, Parrish carefully calibrating Drew's remark.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Whose?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yours.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I'm feeling real uncomfortable right
dialog: now because the guy who reports to
dialog: me is threatening me.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I'm just giving you the truth. There
dialog: was a time when William Parrish liked
dialog: the truth.
text: Joe, although across the room, is all attention.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I think it's time you went home,
dialog: Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Certainly. Goodnight.
text: Drew goes, everybody is in shock, Susan pursues him out into
dialog: the hallway.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Drew!
dialog: He stops.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Never talk to my father like that
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Don't worry about it. There's a
text: beginning and a middle and an end
dialog: to everything. And I think I've
dialog: come to the end of my chapter with
dialog: the Parrishes.
text: Joe has followed them into the hallway.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: And the end began with this guy.
text: Drew looks down towards Joe.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: Mr. Black --? We ran a check on you
dialog: and you know what we came up with?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, I don't --
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Not good, not bad, you know what we
dialog: got? Nothing. No credit, no cars,
dialog: no mortgages -- no wives. Nothing.
dialog: Joe waits.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
text: All of a sudden a guy appears on the
dialog: scene with the Chairman of one of
dialog: the greatest communications corpora-
dialog: tions of the world, the boss makes
dialog: him privy to all the company's
dialog: secrets, he attends the Board meet-
dialog: ings, and us working stiffs with
dialog: MBA's up the ass and years and years
dialog: and years of experience, we're left
dialog: outside with our noses pressed
dialog: against the window.
text: Joe doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: This is a big-time operation, deal-
dialog: ing in big-time issues, demanding
dialog: big-time executives who make big-
dialog: time decisions. So, Joe, why don't
dialog: you tell me exactly what it is
dialog: that's big time about you?
dialog: After a moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You first.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: Why don't you get off his case?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney
dialog: now? Are we going to go to court?
dialog: Or are we going to go to bed? And I
dialog: don't mean you and me. I mean you
dialog: and him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That's it. It's over. Get out.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: So I guess a blowjob's out of the
dialog: question?
text: Joe clears his throat.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: Did you say something?
dialog: Joe considers him evenly.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Almost.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: I said get out.
text: Now Drew wheels, heads right for the front door and exits with
dialog: a SLAM.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What an angry fellow.
text: A moment passes before Susan realizes she and Joe are alone,
dialog: and Joe does as well.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'm sorry about --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Please. We don't need to talk about
dialog: Drew.
dialog: She regards Joe.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No. We don't.
text: They drift, osmotically, into the library in awkward silence.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Brave you had a chance to look at
dialog: Dad's rare books? Jefferson's
dialog: Parliamentary Manual, a first
dialog: edition Bleak House --
text: Joe comes closer, takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I love your smell.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: -- I guess you haven't.
text: Now Susan, close to Joe, leans closer, her nose in Joe's
text: neck. Joe holds himself very still.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: I like your smell, too.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It was everything.
text: Silence, the TICKING of the clock.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: When I was little, my mother used to
dialog: say, "Darling, you could set your
dialog: heart by this clock".
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- Could you?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Never tried, 'til now.
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Joe, may I kiss you?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why, yes. Thank you.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're welcome.
text: Susan reaches out for Joe, they kiss, he is awkward but his
text: very awkwardness endearing. Susan pulls him closer, they
text: linger now, mouths on each other's, then separate.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're welcome.
text: The clock TICKS on. A sense of foreboding falls over Joe's
text: face, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a
dialog: point of no return.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Joe?
text: The apprehensive expression on Joe's face fades away.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't know who you are.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well...I'm -- uh, Joe. And you're
dialog: Susan. And I - uh - have this weak
dialog: feeling in my knees --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And is your heart beating strangely?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Faster. And I want the scent from
dialog: underneath your ears and the taste
dialog: of your lips and the touch of your
dialog: tongue to stay with me -- forever.
text: An intake of breath. She is about to speak.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: And you don't even have to say a
dialog: word.
text: Their faces inches from each other's.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I have to go home.
dialog: But neither Susan nor Joe moves.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Don't I?
text: Her question makes Joe, almost involuntarily, smile. Susan
text: takes the opportunity to step back from him. The SOUND of
text: someone at the door, it is Parrish, Susan turns, comprehends
dialog: immediately how the situation will appear to him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Goodnight, Daddy.
text: She drifts right past him, exits. Joe and Parrish are left
text: alone now, eyes on each other's.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hello, Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Hello. Would you like to join me,
dialog: Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Um -- not right now.
text: An awkward moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Okay. Goodnight.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Goodnight.
text: Parrish turns and exits, Joe's head inclines, he breathes in
text: the scent of his collar.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. EXECUTIVE SUITE, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - NEXT DAY
text: Parrish, followed by Joe, emerges from his private elevator,
dialog: is greeted as usual:
speaker_heading: JENIFER
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Good morning, Jennifer.
speaker_heading: JENIFER
text: The Board is waiting.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JENIFER
dialog: Didn't you call a Board meeting?
text: Jennifer sees Parrish is trying to right his balance, she
dialog: knows better than to press the point.
speaker_heading: JENIFER (cont'd)
dialog: Yes, the members are waiting. They
dialog: are in the Board room now.
text: Jennifer nods respectfully as Parrish doesn't cast a flicker
text: of any further surprise, heads straight for the Board room,
text: Joe right beside him.
scene_heading: INT. BOARD ROOM, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY
text: Parrish and Joe enter, the entire Board is assembled, includ-
dialog: ing Drew, Quince and Sloane.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Good morning.
text: An odd mixture of responses, the Board sheepish and at the
text: same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting,
text: its sudden convening clearly a problem for Parrish, a prob-
text: lem which he does not attempt to hide, only control.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Did you want to have a cup of coffee
dialog: or something, Bill?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't think so. Do you?
text: Drew gets the message, at the same time Joe is checking out
text: all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: To get to the point, we have re-
dialog: ceived new information from John
dialog: Bontecou concerning his desires for
dialog: this company to merge with his, and
dialog: we wanted to set the details before
dialog: you.
text: A moment as Parrish looks around, the moment extends, it
text: appears he may not ever answer.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Bontecou wants a quick response
dialog: and --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: The answer is no, quick enough for
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Don't you want to hear the details?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I'm not interested in the details.
dialog: And I'm not interested in the big
dialog: picture either. What I am inter-
dialog: ersted in is how my Board got conven-
dialog: ed behind my back, is entertaining a
dialog: further proposal from a man whom it
dialog: offends me to do business with,
dialog: moreover has the audacity to present
dialog: this to me like a prize fish, and I
dialog: am expected to clap for it like a
dialog: performing seal. No, thank you.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: So I am to understand from your re-
dialog: sponse that you do not want to hear
dialog: the details of Bontecou's offer?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yes, you are to understand that, and
dialog: now may I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Certainly, Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Are you running this Board or am I?
dialog: Sloane leans in.
speaker_heading: SLOANE
dialog: We're not getting anywhere here.
dialog: Why don't we take some of the best
dialog: out of this thing, let's consider
dialog: it coolly, let's take a week --
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Bontecou wants a speedier response
dialog: than that.
speaker_heading: SLOANE
dialog: He'll wait --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Doesn't need to. Today, tomorrow,
dialog: a week from now -- 'a week from
dialog: now', who can think about a week
dialog: from now -- the answer is going to
dialog: be the same -- a loud, unmistakable,
dialog: all-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'.
text: A BUZZ amongst the Board, they finally rustle into silence
text: under Parrish's withering glance.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: That's it? I've got a busy day
dialog: and this meeting has already set
dialog: me behind. Shall we adjourn?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Before we do, while we're here,
dialog: there is a second question the
dialog: Board would like a response to,
dialog: a far simpler one.
dialog: Parrish waits.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: Who is the man sitting to the right
dialog: of you?
text: Everybody's eyes are on Joe.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I've already introduced Mr. Black to
dialog: you all.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: But who is he? What are his creden-
dialog: tials? What is his relationship to
dialog: you?
dialog: No response from Parrish.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: The feeling of the Board is this: we
dialog: fear Mr. Black is not only influenc-
dialog: ing your decisions in regard to this
dialog: company, but that you are relying on
dialog: him to make them for you.
text: Quince flinches at these words, his hands clasped in front
text: of him, his knuckles white as Parrish regards Drew, but still
dialog: does not answer.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: The lack of response, Bill, is not
dialog: appropriate. We are your Board, we
dialog: have a right to know how you are
dialog: managing the operations of this
dialog: company, and most importantly, that
dialog: you have not delegated someone to do
dialog: it for you.
text: Parrish squirms, desperately uncomfortable but still does
dialog: not speak.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: Okay, one more time.
dialog: Drew regards Joe.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: Who is Joe Black?
text: Parrish stares stoically into the middle distance as
text: Quince's head sinks into his hands.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: (to the Board)
dialog: A motion has been brought before
dialog: the Board to invoke Article 19 of
dialog: the corporate charter.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: In English, please.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Mandatory retirement upon our
dialog: Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
text: Parrish is expressionless.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: At which time, the Chairman will be
dialog: named Emeritus, he will be welcome
dialog: to attend all meetings, and will
dialog: serve as International Spokesman for
dialog: the corporation plus, of course, a
dialog: settlement, a golden parachute of
dialog: such magnitude that his feet will
dialog: never touch the ground.
dialog: Drew pauses.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: Please indicate your vote by a "Yes"
dialog: or "No".
text: A "Yes" is heard, now another "Yes", now more "Yes"es, all
dialog: reluctant, "No" from Sloane, "No" from Quince who realizes
text: he is the instrument of Parrish's dismissal.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: The motion is passed. We will of
dialog: course delay the announcement, out
dialog: of respect for our former Chairman,
dialog: until after the celebration of his
dialog: birthday this weekend.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Thank you for allowing me to save
dialog: face, Drew.
text: Joe's eyes are riveted on Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to the Board)
dialog: The other motion before us is the
dialog: acceptance of John Bontecou's offer
dialog: to merge this corporation with
dialog: Bontecou International --
text: Parrish stands, Drew stops speaking.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Joe?
text: Silence, then Joe rises.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to the Board)
dialog: Who I am, and my relationship to
dialog: Bill, will be divulged in our own
dialog: good time.
text: Joe follows Parrish out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE BOARD ROOM - DAY
text: Sloane has pursued Parrish and Joe.
speaker_heading: SLOANE
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: ...It's not over, 'til it's over.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings"
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: SLOANE
dialog: I still sense some doubt in this
dialog: group, we could turn it around.
dialog: You'll be up in the country?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yes, the big 'celebration' of my
dialog: mandatory retirement birthday.
dialog: You're an honored guest, Eddie.
speaker_heading: SLOANE
dialog: I'm going to stick it out here. We
dialog: still have a shot.
text: The elevator door opens, Parrish and Joe step inside and the
text: door closes, leaving Sloane behind.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY
text: The Board meeting has broken up, clusters of members have
text: lingered, exchanging post-mortems. And enraged Quince has
text: cornered Drew, out of earshot of the others.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: What have you done? You've gotten
dialog: the old man fired!
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: That we did. Thanks to you. He was
dialog: wobbling, mind you, but you stupid
dialog: the coup de grace.
text: Quince falls silent, aquiver with this reality.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: I'm going to put a stop to this!
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Quince, you can't unscramble
dialog: scrambled eggs.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: But I didn't mean to do it!
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: The train's left the station, pal,
dialog: and you're aboard. Would you like
dialog: to hear the silver lining? Check
dialog: that, gold. I've been working with
dialog: John Bontecou all along. We had
dialog: a game plan -- acquire Parrish
dialog: Communications then break it apart
dialog: and peddle it piece-by-piece to the
dialog: highest bidder. I set it up for
text: him, he smacks it out of the park.
text: Quince is struck dumb.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: Don't you know what this'll mean?
dialog: You'll be rich. You'll sell your
dialog: stock, you can stop kissing ass --
dialog: What'll it feel like to be a man?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: I don't want to get rich this way --
dialog: I'm going to expose you.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Go right ahead. Tell William
dialog: Parrish how you betrayed him at
dialog: a secret Board meeting. And tell
dialog: Allison how you got her father
dialog: fired -- and he lost his company.
text: Quince goes ashen.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: It's just life, Quin-cee.
text: Drew hails an employee across the hall.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: (to Quince)
dialog: Wake up and smell the thorns.
text: Drew joins the employee as Quince slumps against the wall.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY
text: Parrish enters, Joe right behind him, Coyle takes their coats,
text: disappears. Parrish hesitates for a moment, shrugs as if he
text: has a thought he doesn't want to share, then heads upstairs
text: with Joe. He is trudging a bit, Joe senses his mood.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm sorry, Bill --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: That's okay.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What's okay?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Just a manner of speaking.
text: Joe seems puzzled.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's
dialog: over. We've got bigger fish to fry,
dialog: don't we, Joe?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: 'Fish'?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Never mind. I'm tired. I'm going
dialog: to take a nap.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Are you hungry? Coyle will have
dialog: Luisa fix you something to eat.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm not hungry.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Then I can't help you.
text: Parrish turns into his bedroom, closing the door gently
text: behind him. Joe continues down the hall, enters the guest
dialog: wing.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY
text: Midday sunlight streams into the sitting room, Joe passes
text: through to his bedroom, sits tentatively on the bed, feels
text: the edge of the silk spread, touches the pillow, then rises
text: again, crosses back to the sitting room.
text: Susan appears in the doorway, Joe suddenly senses her, turns
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're here?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I am.
text: He stands, they regard each other for the moment.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: May I take your coat?
text: She doesn't answer, starts to take off the coat herself, Joe
text: comes around her to help, Susan senses him breathing in the
text: scent at the back of her neck.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge
dialog: a little lunch, I was in the neigh-
dialog: borhood --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How beautiful.
text: He starts to hang Susan's coat up.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Just throw it on the chair.
text: Joe holds her coat carefully on the chair. An awkward
text: moment, the two of them shifting from foot-to-foot.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: When I called, they said that you
dialog: and Daddy had just left the office.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: He's taking a nap.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: He must be tired -- this Bontecou
dialog: thing --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes, he's tired. I believe so.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: You must be hungry?
text: Susan sits on the couch.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, not anymore. Are you?
text: Joe hears the question but doesn't answer, sits down on the
text: couch beside her.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: Are you cold?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: ...No.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Maybe it's the draft through the
dialog: door.
text: She gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to
text: Joe. A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each
text: other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes
text: as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but
dialog: has no knowledge where it is leading. His movements are
text: instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin-
dialog: gers, odd things about her seem to interest him. This
text: excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the
dialog: very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other
dialog: are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know-
dialog: ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions
dialog: are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it
dialog: before.
dialog: Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert-
dialog: ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak-
dialog: ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and
text: Susan builds. Joe has found himself in an unexplored land
dialog: of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet
text: at the same time, is terrified by it. He feels himself being
dialog: lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but
dialog: is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing
text: is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on.
text: The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in
dialog: the end there is the knowledge they have together made a
text: journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events
dialog: they have created; and they don't care about the consequences.
text: Spent, they lie in silence. Finally Susan speaks:
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It's so wonderful to make love to
dialog: you. It's like making love to some-
dialog: one who has never made love before.
dialog: Joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has
dialog: said, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself.
text: He weighs, then resists, the impulse.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thank you.
text: Her head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his
text: comforting her without knowing that he is doing so.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Did you like making love to me?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I loved it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: More than you love peanut butter?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes!
text: She laughs at the earnestness with which he answers.
text: Joe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for
text: the first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone
text: to some distant, distant land.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Nowhere? I'm...here.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: For how long?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh, I hope a long, long time.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Me, too.
dialog: Another moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What do we do now?
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It will come to us.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE (LATER) - DAY
text: Joe and Susan are at the front door, he has helped her
text: on with her coat, she turns around, they kiss. The kiss
text: lingers, Susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back
text: longingly at Joe and then she is gone, Joe closing the door
text: softly after her.
text: He turns back into the foyer, looks up, Parrish is on the
text: balcony, it is clear he has observed Joe and Susan.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hello, Bill.
text: Parrish, in a state of shock, doesn't answer for a moment.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: Did you have a nice nap?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I couldn't sleep.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that.
text: He starts up the stairs.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No, I'll come down
text: Joe waits guardedly at the bottom of the stairs as Parrish
dialog: descends.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: What's going on?
text: Joe senses Parrish's tone, doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: I saw you kiss Susan.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes, I saw you see me.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Well, you're at the wrong place at
dialog: the wrong time with the wrong woman.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'll be the judge of that.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I'm her father!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: With all due respect, Bill, I'm not
dialog: asking your permission.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Well, you goddam well should. You
dialog: walk into my life, give me the worst
dialog: news a guy can get, have me dancing
dialog: on the heads of pins with my busi-
dialog: ness and with my family, and now
dialog: you're spooning with my daughter.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: 'Spooning'?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yes, and stop repeating everything I
dialog: sai, and turning it into a question.
dialog: Spooning, fooling around, God knows
dialog: what. You arrive on the scene -- why
dialog: you picked me, I still don't under-
dialog: stand --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I picked you for your verve, your
dialog: excellence, and for your ability to
dialog: - how shall I say - instruct. You've
dialog: lived a first-rate life. And I find
dialog: it eminently usable.
dialog: Parrish measures Joe.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What do you want?
text: Joe doesn't answer, riveted now on Parrish.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Everybody wants something, Joe.
dialog: You've been taking me from pillar
dialog: to post here. I thought I knew who
dialog: you were, and it wasn't a whole lot
dialog: of fun, however it was almost bear-
dialog: able. Now I'm getting something
dialog: else from you, something very, very
dialog: strange -- what is it that you want,
dialog: Joe?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm only following the Parrish
dialog: bywords. Looking for that 'ounce
dialog: of excitement', that 'whisper of a
dialog: thrill' -- What there is no sense
dialog: living your life without. You know
dialog: what I mean, Bill.
text: Parrish's jaw sets.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You're violating the laws of the
dialog: universe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: This universe?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Any universe that exists or ever
dialog: existed. You may be the pro, Joe.
dialog: But I know who you are. And you're
dialog: all fucked up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't like your tone, and I don't
dialog: like your references.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: And I don't give a shit.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: May I remind you this is not just a
dialog: dispute with a putative suitor, this
dialog: is me. So watch it...Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you
dialog: sonofabitch.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I told you, 'watch it'.
text: Silence. Now Joe turns on his heel, heads right out the
text: front door. Parrish is left solitary, confounded, staring
text: at the closed door.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM AREA, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Joe walks down a hallway, a bouquet of flowers in hand,
text: looks around the usual feverish activity, he seems lost for
text: the moment, but a Receptionist catches his eye.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Dr. Parrish.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
text: She comes on at 6.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh.
text: He looks at the flowers, regards them for a moment, then
text: heads for an elevator.
scene_heading: INT. EASTER'S ROOM, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Easter is sitting up in bed, hooked up to an TV and moni-
text: tors. She glances over at the doorway, Joe is standing
text: there, observing her. An awkward silence, he looks at
text: his flowers again, now sets them respectfully on Easter's
dialog: bedstand.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: Mistah Bad News. 'Bout time you
dialog: show up.
text: Joe speaks to her in the dialect.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don' be facety, woman.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: None facety, mistah. You come for
dialog: me? Dat's good news.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, I come to see Doctor.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: Doctor? What could be wrong wit'
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Nuthin'.
text: Silence, then Easter smiles.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: My Doctor Lady?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Mine, too.
text: She thinks about this for the moment, Joe grows uncomfort-
dialog: able.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: You in love?
text: Joe seems slightly tormented by the question, Easter senses
text: him trying to frame a respect.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yah.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: You loved back?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: She knows you real self?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: She knows how she feel.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: Rass!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (irritably)
dialog: Don' need you okayin'.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: Schoolboy tings is you head.
dialog: Badness for you, badness for her,
dialog: badness for me, lyin' here tumor,
dialog: big as breadfruit, poison my inners
dialog: an' waiting.
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Can do no right by people. Come to
dialog: take, you wan' to stay, leave you
dialog: stay, you wan' to go. Rahtid!
text: Silence, Easter waits, watching Joe.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: You not in you right place, mistah.
text: Easter's response stops Joe cold, he looks away and then
text: back at her, she had clearly reached him.
speaker_heading: EASTER (cont'd)
dialog: I ain' either. No more. You come
dialog: wi' me now. Take me.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But I not lonely here. Somebody
dialog: want me here.
text: Easter considers Joe, she smiles sympathetically.
speaker_heading: EASTER
dialog: It nice it happen to you. It like
dialog: you came to Cat Island and you had
dialog: a holiday, sun didn't burn you red,
dialog: just brown, sleep no mosquito eat
dialog: you, rum no poung you head nex' day.
dialog: But trut' is, dat bound to happen,
dialog: you stay long enough. So tak dat
dialog: nice picture home wi' you, but don'
dialog: be fooled. We lonely here mostly,
dialog: too. If we lucky, we got some nice
dialog: pictures.
text: Easter drifts into silence, her eyes and Joe's meet, a sense
text: they understand each other. Easter shifts, trying hard to
dialog: ease her discomfort.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Got enough nice pictured, Easter.
text: She looks at him and nods gratefully and closes her eyes.
text: Joe watches her, now his eyes close. Easter exhales
text: raspingly, falls still. The monitors flatline. A beeping
text: alarm sound somewhere down the hall.
text: Joe opens his eyes, takes a deep breath, he seems troubled.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: G'bye, sistah.
text: She slips out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Parrish is playing solitaire. The SOUND of the front door
text: closing, HEELS crossing the foyer, he looks up, at the foyer
dialog: door is Susan.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Hello, honey.
text: He starts to get up, she motions to him to stay, looks
dialog: around now.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Where's Joe?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Joe?
dialog: A silence.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Joe's not around.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't know.
text: Susan seems distracted.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Why are you looking for Joe?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Because I was sitting in a staff
dialog: meeting, incredibly bored, my mind
dialog: kept wandering and the only place it
dialog: landed was -- Joe.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Love. Passion. Obsession, all
dialog: those things you told me to wait
dialog: for. Well, they've arrived.
text: Parrish blinks, stares down at his cards.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: This is crazy --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Why? A man appears at your side,
dialog: almost never leaves it, you clearly
dialog: trust him, depend on him, I sense
dialog: you value him deeply, why aren't
dialog: those things good enough for me?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You don't know anything about Joe --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What are you afraid of, Dad? That
dialog: I'll fall head over heels for Joe --
dialog: well, I have -- as you did with Mom.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: That's always been standard,
dialog: whether you like or not.
text: Parrish tries to get hold of himself, changes gear now.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Susan, I don't think Joe is going to
dialog: be with us long.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Where's he going?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't know, I can't say --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: C'mon! The guy's working with you.
dialog: You always know chapter and verse
dialog: about everyone who works --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: In this case, I can't. I - uh -- I
dialog: just can't help you. I only would
dialog: tell you -- that with Joe, you are
dialog: on very, very dangerous ground.
text: Susan doesn't answer for a moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I love him.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't care if you love him! I'm
dialog: telling you he's no good for you!
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Of course not, Daddy. I'm sorry.
text: There is something in Susan's tone that lets him know not a
text: word has sunk in. Parrish slumps.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: I love you, too.
text: She kisses Parrish, rearranges one of his ranks of cards,
text: shuffles through the deck, turns over the top card, lays
dialog: down a card Parrish needs.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
text: Lightning does strike.
text: Parrish watches as Susan turns, disappears out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. THIRD AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY - TWILIGHT
text: Joe walking disconcertedly up the street, bumping shoulders
text: with the rush hour crowd, trapped in the life of the city,
text: he peers intently at faces, cars, into store windows. He
text: stops now at the window of a Korean grocery, something has
text: caught his eye, he steps inside.
text: Through the window, Joe can be seen making a purchase, he
text: hands the Korean Clerk some money, walks out.
text: Joe, back on the street now, unscrews the top of a jar of
text: peanut butter, dips a wad out with his fingers. The Korean
text: Clerk runs out after him.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Change! Change!
text: Joe stops, uncomprehending. The Clerk hands Joe bills and
dialog: coins.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why are you giving me money?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Change.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I am who I am. I cannot change.
text: Joe tries to hand the money back, but the baffled Clerk
dialog: refuses it.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: You change!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's impossible. You're wasting
dialog: your money. I couldn't change even
dialog: if I wanted to.
text: The Clerk, exasperated, murmurs something in his language
text: and returns to the store. Joe continues on down the street.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Parrish is sitting in a wing chair staring at the fire. Joe
text: appears in the doorway, Parrish doesn't notice him. Joe
text: waits, finally Parrish looks up. They regard each other.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Uh --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- I have the feeling that, all in
dialog: all, what I made this voyage for --
dialog: has served its purpose.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What are you saying, that it's time
dialog: to go?
text: Joe doesn't respond, Parrish and Joe measure each other for
dialog: the moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: I'm ready.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You are?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Good. Tomorrow, after the party.
text: Parrish nods, Joe nods back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HELICOPTER POV, HUDSON VALLEY - AFTERNOON
text: A bird's eye view of the Hudson, over the George Washington
text: Bridge, past the widest expanse of the river at the Tappan
text: Zee, coming in now over the great lawns and old estates of
dialog: the Upper Hudson Valley, down towards Annadale-on-Hudson
dialog: and the Parrish country estate, which commands a beehive of
text: activity, tents and workmen and vehicles.
scene_heading: EXT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON
text: The Parrish AStar sets down in its roped-off landing area.
text: The Butler runs towards it to open the door, Parrish and
text: Joe disembark. Following the Butler, they make their way
text: through the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for
text: music groups, portable pools with clusters of florists
text: leaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within. Parrish
text: and Joe move solemnly, observing the activity, not speaking
text: to one another. Although they are shoulder-to-shoulder,
text: there is a distance between them. They walk on past chan-
text: deliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven
text: through their branches. Adding to the confusion, the AStar
text: lifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling
text: from the blast of the rotors. May, the housekeeper, appears.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Telephone call, sir. Mr. Sloane
dialog: from New York.
text: Parrish nods, starts up for a wing off the main house, Joe
text: right at his side. Parrish stops.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Joe, not knowing whether to be affronted or not, hesitates,
text: and Parrish strides away. Joe does not follow.
scene_heading: INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON
text: A low-slung but well-appointed room with a writing table, a
dialog: working fireplace, expensive and appropriate Hudson Valley
dialog: prints.
text: Parrish enters, clicks on the SPEAKERPHONE, observes the
text: party activity through a wide, bow window.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Eddie?
speaker_heading: SLOANE (O.S.)
dialog: (speakerphone)
dialog: Yeah - Bill - How are you? You okay?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Fine, fine. Big doing up here. Why
dialog: are you still down here?
speaker_heading: SLOANE (O.S.)
dialog: (speakerphone)
dialog: The Board's working through the
dialog: weekend, trying up the loose ends
dialog: this damn thing. But I want to give
dialog: it one more try, I'm still holding
dialog: out some hope.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Eddie, hold out all the hope you
dialog: want but, I promise you, it's hope-
dialog: less, it's over. Come on up, let's
dialog: get drunk, if I had your shoulder
dialog: to lean on I might actually enjoy
dialog: this --
speaker_heading: SLOANE (O.S.)
dialog: (speakerphone)
dialog: No, I'm going to stay down here,
dialog: keep my finger in the dike and maybe
dialog: by Monday, the waters could recede.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: If you're trying to show me lay-
dialog: down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty,
dialog: forget it.
speaker_heading: SLOANE (O.S.)
dialog: (speakerphone)
dialog: Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your
dialog: cake, blow out the candles and make
dialog: a wish. Talk to you Monday. Okay?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for
dialog: the memory.
text: Parrish clicks off the SPEAKERPHONE, turns around and looks
text: out the window again, the party preparations in full swing,
text: colored lights are tested, they flicker on and off.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON
text: Allison is everywhere, Parrish emerges from his wing, she
text: catches his eye immediately, the calm director of a DeMille-
text: like epic, politely giving workers instructions, making
dialog: lightning decisions.
text: Parrish turns his attention now to an ice-filled fountain
text: encircling two giant topiary letters written in faux-
text: Cyrillic, a 'B' and a 'P', as rubber-booted delivery men
text: carefully arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each
text: letter. A smile creases Parrish's face as, in an unexpected
text: lull, Allison backs into him at the fountain.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: It's starting to grow on me. But
dialog: what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: The fountain is the Caspian Sea and
dialog: the Sea is serving up caviar. The
dialog: 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for
dialog: Petrossian. Of course, they also
dialog: stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Do they, m'dear?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: -- Plus we've got a baritone with a
dialog: balalaika coming from The Russian
dialog: Tea Room. I've dressed him in a
dialog: Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson
dialog: Eddy songs.
text: Parrish shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You are amazing. Why, oh why,
dialog: Allison, are you doing all this?
text: But before she can answer, a workman is tugging at Allison's
text: sleeve, she turns away from Parrish to give him instructions
text: out of Parrish's earshot, and then turns back, they step away
text: now, daughter and father, alone.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I do it because I love you. Because
dialog: everybody I loved you. Mommy -- wher-
dialog: ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the
dialog: people who work for you, everybody
dialog: who's ever known you.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yeah? And what about my enemies?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: They respect you. Isn't that a kind
dialog: of love?
text: Unexpectedly, Allison brushes a lock away from Parrish's
text: forehead, with a flick she has rearranged his hair, he
text: blinks, a little embarrassed, but having liked it.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: Above all, you've been a wonderful
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I haven't been the father to you
dialog: that --
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: That you've been to Susan?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I wasn't going to say --
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: But that's what you were thinking.
dialog: And that's okay. Because I know you
dialog: love me. Not like it is with Susan,
dialog: the way your eyes light up when she
text: comes in the room and the way she
dialog: always gets a laugh out of you, as
dialog: opposed to me when I walk in a room
dialog: and that look comes over your face,
dialog: "What does she want now?"
text: A weather-beaten military parade ground pennant passes, 24th
dialog: Infantry Regiment "C" (Charlie) Company.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: I already feel I've had everything I
dialog: could have wanted for my birthday --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Hey, there's lots to come.
dialog: (gesturing to me
dialog: activity)
dialog: A little excess -- like you love.
text: The preparations are building to a climax, all the elaborate
dialog: plans coming to fruition.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You know, darling, this is going to
dialog: be a wonderful party.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Yes, it is.
text: Allison wades into the maelstrom now, Parrish watches her
text: go, swarms of purveyors and caterers following her.
scene_heading: EXT. WINE BAR, LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON
text: Ambrose, the head caterer, is making a last minute check
text: of the bar's stock, Quince ambles up, in the background the
text: activity has built to a pitch, waiters adjusting their uni-
text: forms, purveyors' trucks pulling out in a cloud of dust.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Give me a Seagrams and '7'.
text: Ambrose looks at him blankly.
speaker_heading: QUICNCE (cont'd)
dialog: No got? Okay a double V.O., water
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: AMBROSE
dialog: I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr.
dialog: Quince.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
speaker_heading: AMBROSE
dialog: Red or white?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Both.
text: Joe appears, looking bewildered, jostled by caterers setting
text: up last-minute tables, a drummer from the band rolls his
text: traps past on a little cart. Joe doesn't seem to know where
text: he is, when his eyes alight on Quince, he heads for this
text: oasis. Ambrose sets down two bottles of wine and departs.
speaker_heading: QUINCE (cont'd)
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: Red or white?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, thank you.
text: Quince sips the red, now the white, now he pours some of
dialog: each into one glass.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: C'mon, have a drink. You look like
dialog: you need one bad as me.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Do I? I'm a little confused.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Confused, huh? About what?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Love.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: 'Love'? Oh, man, I've got troubles
dialog: of my own.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You love Allison, don't you?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Oh yes, I do.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How did you meet?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: I was a world-class loser and she
dialog: was a happy, little rich girl --
dialog: and for some reason she took me in.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But she loves you?
text: Quince smiles, nods embarrassedly.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Because there's nothing we don't
dialog: know about each other and it's okay.
dialog: I mean the deeper, darkest secrets
dialog: -- they don't matter.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: 'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Yeah, it's like you know every inch
dialog: of each other's souls -- and then
dialog: you're free.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What do you mean 'free'?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Free to love each other. Com-
dialog: pletely. Totally. No fear.
text: Quince seems uncharacteristically within himself.
speaker_heading: QUINCE (cont'd)
dialog: All that hoopla up there reminds me
dialog: how I will never measure up to a man
dialog: like Bill Parrish - or his daughter.
text: He drains his wine.
speaker_heading: QUINCE (cont'd)
dialog: Do you like me, Joe?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: What would you say if you knew
dialog: it was me who brought down Bill
dialog: Parrish?
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: I told Drew and the Board that Bill
dialog: depended on you. Drew led me on,
dialog: but I had no business telling him
dialog: in the first place. He was setting
dialog: up Bill from day one. Drew and
dialog: Bontecou are going to chop up the
dialog: company and sell it off for parts.
dialog: Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr.
dialog: Inside. And I was the fool who made
dialog: it all happen. Oh God, what do I do?
dialog: Joe regards Quince.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Go to Bill Parrish and tell him
dialog: everything. He'll forgive you.
text: Quince drains one more glass of wine.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: You think so? How do you know?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Because that's the kind of man Bill
dialog: Parrish is.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Well, maybe... I guess you know him
dialog: better than anybody.
dialog: Another moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- Getting to.
text: The orchestra behind them plays a few riffs, sound checks,
dialog: getting close.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Do you think I should wait to tell
dialog: him 'till after the party?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No.
text: Quince nods anxiously, then smiles gratefully. They look on
text: as the pre-party activities swirl on around them.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET (LATER)
text: The moment just before sunset, the last pre-party minutes,
text: a procession of guests' cars winding up to the guest house,
text: being directed into adjacent fields. Susan cuts past a re-
text: ceiving line that files up the stairs, she skirts the house
text: and heads straight for the action, the party on the lawns in
text: the rear, climbs a terrace where she commands a view of the
text: event on which the curtain is just about to rise.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWN, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET
text: Guests milling, emerging from the crowd Susan sees, isolated
text: by a fountain, Joe. He looks up towards her, he knows she
text: has seen him, they proceed to a rendezvous that has not been
text: prearranged but which they intuit. Susan slants through the
text: guests, stopping here and there, excited greetings and cha-
dialog: tter float on the wind, "He, Susie!", "What a party", "You
text: look great", she keeps moving, a shimmering wraith.
text: Joe is on the right coordinate to meet her, his graceful,
text: unfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is
text: not certain of, but where he knows he will find Susan.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET
text: The very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse
text: of river, the light catching Susan and Joe as they enter the
text: garden, the party forming behind them, the river flowing in
text: front of them.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I like you in a black tie.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I love you in an evening gown.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Daddy told me you might be leaving?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes. Your father and I, our time
text: together has come to an end.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Where are you going?
text: Joe attempts to answer, but nothing comes out.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: You won't tell me?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well -- I --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And you can't tell me who you are.
text: Again the same indescribable gesture from Joe.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: I'm in love with a man, I don't know
dialog: who he is, where he's going or when.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I can tell you the when part. Tonight.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It gets worse.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No worse than it gets for me. I'm
dialog: in love with a woman whom I don't
dialog: want to leave.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Then don't.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We know so little about each
dialog: other --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: We know all that we need to know --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But there's so much to tell you --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't. That will come later.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Will it?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Lightning struck. We caught it in
dialog: a bottle. Don't let it out. I want
dialog: to be with you, Joe --
dialog: Another moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What will we do?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: 'Love will find out the way'.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: 'Love will find out the way'?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It's a saying.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I believe that, don't you?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes, that's why I said it.
text: They are on the brink of some decision, Joe is about to make
dialog: some declaration when Allison is heard --
speaker_heading: ALLISON (O.S.)
dialog: There you are!
text: Allison appears.
speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: What's going on here? Tete-a-tetes
dialog: on my big night?
dialog: (to Susan)
dialog: C'mon honey, you're needed.
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: Can it wait?
dialog: But before he can answer --
speaker_heading: ALLISON (cont'd)
dialog: Glad to hear it!
dialog: (to Susan)
dialog: Let's go.
text: She takes Susan's arm and marches her off, Joe, in thrall,
text: watches them go as the MUSIC erupts behind them, as 'up'
text: dance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all. The
text: curtain has risen on William Parrish's 65th birthday party.
scene_heading: INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT
text: Quince is "on the carpet", sweating through a confession,
text: Parrish moroses but philosophical at his desk.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: ...what can I say after I say that
dialog: I'm sorry? I zipped when I should've
dialog: zagged, I opened my big mouth one
dialog: too many times, everything got all
dialog: twisted --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: It's okay, Quince. I understand.
dialog: You've always meant well and I
dialog: appreciate that. Sometimes things
dialog: just turn out -- wrong.
text: A KNOCK on the door, it opens, Joe appears.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Excuse me --
text: He starts to step out.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you
dialog: -- okay, Bill?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Sure.
text: As Joe enters, Quince flashes a warm smile at him.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Joe knew the whole story. I told
dialog: him. It was his idea that I come
dialog: clean. I mean I wanted to come
dialog: clean but he gave me a pair of
dialog: balls, you know what I mean?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yes, I believe I do.
text: Quince now drifts off.
speaker_heading: QUICHE
dialog: Yeah, well -- I can tell you guys
dialog: got business --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No, I'm out of business, right,
dialog: Quince? However I do have some
dialog: unfinished business -- with Drew.
dialog: Get him out here. Get him on the
dialog: chopper and get him out here to-
dialog: night. I want to tell this guy
dialog: how I feel about him face-to-face.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Oh, that could be a tall order, B.P.
dialog: I doubt that Drew's anxious to see
dialog: you face-to-face.
text: Joe steps in.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Quince)
dialog: Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges
dialog: that this was a contest and he's
dialog: lost. The race is to the swift,
dialog: but could Drew summon a modicum
dialog: of understanding and allow Bill to
dialog: save face. Tell him Bill wants it
dialog: understood in the business community
text: he has merely moved upstairs in his
dialog: own company, and the executive
text: continuity is unbroken. Tonight's
dialog: the night to do it. He'll introduce
dialog: Drew to his press friends as well as
dialog: some of his close acquaintances from
dialog: Washington and Drew can tell them
dialog: that everything's sailing along just
dialog: fine.
text: Parrish is impressed by Joe's acumen, a look of grudging
text: admiration. He nods to Joe, summarizes:
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (to Quince)
dialog: All in all, what Bill wants to do is
dialog: build the golden bridge to Drew with
dialog: no hard feelings.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: You think Drew will go for it?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Quince, I've got confidence in you.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Sir, I'll deliver the package.
text: He heads out, Parrish and Joe fall silent.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not at all.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: How are you doing?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What the hell do you care?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I was just asking, Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You 'want to know', I'll tell you.
dialog: You're looking at a man who tonight
dialog: is not about to walk through the
dialog: Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's
text: galloping into it. And the same time,
dialog: the business he built with his own
text: hands and his own head is being
text: commandeered by a couple of cheap
dialog: pirates. And, oh yes, I almost
dialog: forgot, my daughter's fallen in
dialog: love with Death.
dialog: Another moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- And I'm in love with your
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Say again?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm in love with your daughter, and
dialog: I'm taking her with me tonight.
text: Parrish is stunned.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You're what?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I think you heard me, Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You're not taking Susan anywhere.
dialog: And what the hell does that mean
dialog: anyway?
text: Joe doesn't answer for a moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: I thought we had a deal.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm sorry, Bill --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Susan is my daughter, she has a
dialog: wonderful life ahead of her and
dialog: you're going to deprive her of
dialog: it and you're telling me you're
dialog: sorry? Well, I'm sorry, apology
dialog: not accepted.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I love her, Bill. She is all that
dialog: I ever wanted, and I've never wanted
dialog: for anything because I've never
dialog: wanted anything before, if you can
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: How perfect for you -- to take
dialog: whatever you want because it
dialog: pleases you. It's not love --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Then what is it?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Some aimless infatuation in which,
dialog: for the moment, you feel like in-
dialog: dulging. It's missing everything
dialog: that matters.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Which is what?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Trust, responsibility, taking the
dialog: weight, for your choices and feel-
dialog: ings and spending the rest of your
dialog: life living up to them. And above
dialog: all, not hurting the object of your
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So that's what love is?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Multiply it by infinity and take it
dialog: to the death of forever and you will
dialog: still have barely a glimpse of what
dialog: I am talking about.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Those were my words, Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Well, they're mine now.
text: Joe is silent for a moment, cogitating.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Susan wants to come. She says she's
dialog: in love with me.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: With you?! Who is 'you'? Did you
dialog: tell her who you are?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Does she know where she's going?
text: Joe doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Susan went, in whatever way she did,
dialog: for that poor sonofabitch whose body
dialog: you took, and everything else since
dialog: has been aftermath. You say you love
dialog: her but you don't know what love is.
dialog: She 'loves' you but she doesn't know
dialog: who you are. You make a deal, you're
dialog: breaking it -- the bottom line is,
dialog: Joe, you're conducting a Great
dialog: Romance under false pretenses.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't like what you're saying.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I don't expect you to.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Are you threatening me?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan
dialog: from the moment she was born, and I
dialog: love her now, and every minute in
dialog: between, and what I dream of is a
dialog: man who will discover her and she
dialog: will discover a man who will love
dialog: her, who is worthy of her, who is of
dialog: this world, of this time and has the
dialog: grace and compassion and fortitude
text: to walk beside her as she makes her
dialog: way through this beautiful thing
dialog: called life.
text: Parrish is beginning to reach Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Are you telling me I can't be
dialog: part of it?
text: A pause, Parrish's posture changes.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Why did you come in here and tell
dialog: me, Joe? You are the Biggest Shot
dialog: of all, you don't have to ask my
dialog: permission, but that's what you're
dialog: doing. You know why? Because you've
dialog: somewhere, somehow, developed into a
dialog: good guy, and you know this is all
dialog: wrong... I don't know what you're
dialog: going to do -- how can this be love?
dialog: She doesn't know who you are. Why
dialog: don't you tell her? Try it out on
dialog: her? See what happens. Reveal
dialog: everything there is to know about
dialog: yourself and let the chips fall
dialog: where they may.
dialog: Joe has received what Parrish has said.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Okay? -- I've given it my best shot.
dialog: I wish I could tell you to sleep on
dialog: it but...
text: Parrish lets his words drift into silence, he shrugs, Joe
dialog: regards him.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT
text: Joe makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a
text: weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself
text: until he is hit by the lights and laughter and MUSIC of the
text: party. He drifts into the center and runs right into Susan,
text: couples swirl about them, the eye of a storm of gaiety.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hello, Joe. What'd you know?
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: There's something so indescribably
dialog: sexy about you in a crowd. I could
dialog: make love to you right here.
text: He hesitates, reaches out to take her hand, studies it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: If you're going to tell my future,
dialog: you're on the wrong side.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: There is something I do want to tell
dialog: you --
text: He stammers into silence.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: But you can't.
text: Joe is about to respond but doesn't.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Just then -- when you hesitated --
dialog: the way you shift from foot-to-foot,
dialog: I've always found endearing but just
dialog: now -- I got a chill.
text: But he drifts again, now she takes his hand.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Remember that morning in the coffee
dialog: shop? You said 'What's wrong with
text: taking care of a woman, she takes
dialog: care of you --"
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Did I say that?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And I said you'd have a hard time
dialog: finding a woman like that.
text: Joe shifts, she smiles at his embarrasement.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Well, you've found one, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: The 'coffee shop' --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: -- That was the place... and you were
dialog: the guy.
text: Joe seems resigned now, the air gone out of him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: And you said you didn't want me to
dialog: be your doctor because you didn't
dialog: want me to examine you --?
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Well, I got to examine you after
dialog: all --
text: Joe blinks, at a loss.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: I could come with you --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I - uh --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You want me to wait for you, you'll
dialog: be back --
text: Joe doesn't answer, Susan is suddenly anxious.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Why do I want this night to last
dialog: forever?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't you know, that's what I want
dialog: more than anything.
text: He touches her face.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You said before you couldn't tell me
dialog: who or where, only the 'when' -- Is
dialog: when now?
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: May I kiss you?
text: She waits. He kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That felt like a goodbye.
text: Joe's silence is heavy.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: What's going on, Joe? I feel like
dialog: we're lifting off --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm still here.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: But you're not. You're somewhere
dialog: else.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: You're someone else --
text: Joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he
text: drifts into a long silence. Susan is beside herself, her
text: emotions tossed in every direction, Joe steadies her.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Tell me you love me -- tell me
dialog: you love me now --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I love you now, I'll love you
dialog: always --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hold me --
text: He holds on tight to her. They are desperately entwined
text: until finally she releases him.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Susan --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: -- Yes?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thank you for loving me.
text: She smiles wanly, Joe leaves her.
scene_heading: INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT
text: Parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party
text: flashing past, the MUSIC and laughter audible but muted,
text: the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself.
text: Joe enters, Parrish looks up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: ...We should think about getting
dialog: started, Bill.
dialog: Parrish waits.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: It'll just be us.
text: The tension in Parrish's body releases, he takes a breath.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Thank you.
text: Joe nods an acknowledgement, but his face reflects his pain.
text: Parrish regards him sympathetically.
text: The silence is broken by a KNOCK on the door. Parrish, out
text: of politeness to Joe, does not respond.
speaker_heading: QUINCE (O.S.)
dialog: Bill --?
dialog: After a moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Come in.
text: Quince appears, flushed with excitement.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: -- I got him. The chopper's two
dialog: minutes away.
text: Parrish weighs the information for a moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: How are we on time?
text: Joe shrugs, nods gently.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (to Quince)
dialog: Get him in here.
text: Quince exits, Parrish presses the button for the speaker-
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: ...May? -- I know you're busy, but I
dialog: want you to put in a call to Eddie
dialog: Sloane for me --
speaker_heading: MAY (O.S.)
dialog: At home, sir --?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No, he's at the office.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT
text: An area on the fringe of the party, the helicopter blades
text: stop spinning. Quince hurries to the aircraft door, opens
text: it and Drew steps out. Quince leads the way through the
text: lights and MUSIC. Drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for
text: himself, hails partygoers as he passes, Quince enjoying the
dialog: irony.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: This is damn big of Bill, I also
dialog: think it's smart.
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: He had no choice. You're a
dialog: formidable adversary.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: He said that?
speaker_heading: QUINCE
dialog: Well, you've got him by the short-
dialog: hairs.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
text: He flashes a pleased-as-punch greeting to some unseen
text: acquaintance as they press on to Parrish's study.
scene_heading: INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT
text: Parrish is at his desk, Joe in a distant corner of the room.
speaker_heading: SLOANE (O.S.)
dialog: (speakerphone)
dialog: We're all here, Bill --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I appreciate this, Eddie, members
dialog: of the Board, this will just take a
dialog: minute of your time. As the custo-
dialog: dians of the company, you may re-
dialog: ceive information from what follows
dialog: that is valuable to you --
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: -- or not. Either way, thanks.
speaker_heading: SLOANE (O.S.)
dialog: (speakerphone)
dialog: We're all ears.
text: Drew enters with Quince, Quince nods, excusing himself, and
text: closes the door behind him.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hi, Bill, happy birthday --
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: DREW (cont'd)
dialog: I just wanted to say how appre-
dialog: ciative I am of this - uh - grand
dialog: gesture and --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Shut up and sit down.
text: Drew takes a seat.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: You're a worthless sack of shit, you
dialog: fucked me over, played footsie with
dialog: John Bontecou, sold my company out
dialog: to line your own pockets.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I don't know where you get that idea
dialog: -- the Board agreed --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: The Board didn't know you're a mole
dialog: who burrowed inside so you could bury
dialog: us all.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Is this Mr. Black's fantasy? Another
dialog: one of his whoppers? Aren't you
dialog: sick of this asshole lurking around?
dialog: No one knows who he is, but one
dialog: thing everyone does know, he somehow
dialog: got your ear and has been pouring
dialog: poison into it ever since.
dialog: Joe can no longer control himself.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're the poison, Drew. You've
dialog: operated behind-the-scenes to suborn
dialog: the trust of a man who has stamped
dialog: you with his imprimatur of class and
dialog: elegance and stature. I've seen all
dialog: kinds and degrees of deception in my
dialog: time, but Bill Parrish has been on
dialog: the receiving end of machinations so
dialog: Machiavellian that it has rarely
dialog: been my experience to encounter. And
text: yet he has combatted them stoically,
dialog: and selflessly, without revealing my
dialog: identity. Had he violated the vow
dialog: of secrecy he took, his task would
dialog: have been far easier, he could have
dialog: turned defeat into victory, but he
dialog: is too honorable a man to have done
dialog: that. And now I must release him
dialog: from that vow. Because of me, he
dialog: has lost his work, his company, his
dialog: reputation -- and now he's going to
dialog: tell you who I am.
text: Parrish is struck dumb. He looks at Joe pleadingly, shaking
text: his head imperceptibly, but Joe nods to him blithely -- and
text: then commandingly.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in
dialog: my pants.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- And now you're going to pee some
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Joe, don't do this --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's time to put this person where
dialog: he belongs.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: It's not necessary, Joe. Drew's
dialog: going to step aside --
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I'm not stepping anywhere --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I appreciate your gentlemanliness,
dialog: Bill, but what we need to do here is
dialog: drive the dagger home --
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: The dagger --?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I told you to shut up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: He is --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'll take it from here --
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: I am --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: -- An IRS man.
text: Drew is stunned, Joe glances at Parrish, hesitates.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Yes, he is. He's an -- IRS man.
dialog: Aren't you, Joe?
text: Joe is at a loss, Parrish's eyes are glued to his, Joe gets
dialog: the hint.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes, I am.
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: IRS man.
text: Drew's head swivels from Joe to Parrish and back again.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: The Treasury Department asked
dialog: my cooperation in his undercover
dialog: investigation of John Bontecou.
dialog: They were convinced that Bontecou,
dialog: on past deals, had structured his
dialog: mergers and acquisitions in sus-
dialog: picious and complicated ways so as
dialog: to evade paying the taxes he is
dialog: liable for. The IRS wanted to go
dialog: after him, and this deal offered
dialog: them the opportunity.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: I agreed to cooperate.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: And we're very grateful.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Moreover, Agent Joe Black here --
dialog: of course that's not his real name
dialog: -- smelled out your involvement,
dialog: Drew. He developed evidence you
dialog: were working both sides of the
dialog: fence. Unfortunately, that's known
dialog: as a conflict of interest --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Undisclosed conflict of interest --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: An offense --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: An indictable offense.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I think I'd like to talk to my
dialog: lawyer --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No lawyers, Drew. We're going to
dialog: offer you a deal.
dialog: Drew is all attention.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Confess to the Board every details of
dialog: your participation and then submit
dialog: your resignation.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: And what do I get?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You get not to go to jail.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You're talking through your hat.
dialog: You're offering a deal because
dialog: you've got no proof.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Proof? We've got plenty of proof.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Drew)
text: And he's talking through his lips.
text: Joe steps forward.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: Make no mistake, Drew, if you choose
dialog: to test my resolve in this matter,
dialog: you'll be looking at an outcome that
dialog: will have a finality that is beyond
dialog: your comprehension, and you'll not
dialog: be counting the days or the months
dialog: or the years, but millenniums in the
dialog: house with no doors.
text: Drew slumps.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: All right, you win. As soon as I
dialog: get back to the city, I'll meet with
dialog: the Board.
text: Sloane's voice erupts over the SPEAKERPHONE.
speaker_heading: SLOANE (O.S.)
dialog: You're meeting with the Board right
text: now, Drew. Resignation accepted.
dialog: Moreover, I propose a motion to re-
dialog: confirm William Parrish as Chairman
dialog: of the Board of Parrish Communica-
dialog: tions as well as a rejection of the
dialog: merger with Bontecou International.
dialog: How say you, Board?
text: A chorus of thunderous "Yes"es resounds through the
speaker_heading: SPEAKERPHONE.
speaker_heading: SLOANE (O.S., cont'd)
dialog: The motion is passed.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Well, thank you, that's great, but
dialog: it's more than I bargained for. I
dialog: just wanted to set the record
dialog: straight.
speaker_heading: SLOANE (O.S.)
dialog: But we want you back, Bill. Mean-
dialog: while, enjoy your party, celebrate,
dialog: we'll attend to the nasty details.
dialog: And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: My pleasure. This is an IRS Agent's
dialog: dream. I'll be promoted to Chief of
dialog: Section off of this.
text: Parrish clicks the speakerphone off. Drew is staring at
text: Joe, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Who would've ever believed it? You,
dialog: an IRS Agent --
text: Silence. Joe shrugs, smiles.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: 'Death and Taxes'.
text: The door flies open, an anxious Allison appears.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Daddy! We've been looking all over
dialog: for you - this is your party - what
dialog: are you doing in here? Never mind.
dialog: You're on. Let's go.
text: She pulls him out of his chair, hustles him out of the room,
text: Joe right behind them.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT
text: The guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the
text: orchestra strikes up "Happy Birthday" as Parrish appears
text: with Allison. An enormous cake is unveiled with one great,
text: lit candle, Parrish beams then laughs. He pauses over the
text: cake, now blows the candle out. APPLAUSE, cries of "Speech!
text: Speech!", Parrish tries to demur but the request becomes
text: loud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the
text: crowd. Joe observes from the fringe.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (to the guests)
dialog: I thought I was going to sneak away
dialog: tonight...
dialog: YELLS of "No!" "Never!"
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: ...What a glorious night, every
dialog: face I see is a memory. It may not
dialog: be a perfectly perfect memory --
dialog: sometimes we had our ups and downs
dialog: -- but we're all together, and
dialog: you're mine for a night.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: -- And I'm going to break precedent,
dialog: and tell you my one-candle wish --
dialog: that you would have a life as lucky
dialog: as mine, where you can wake up one
dialog: morning and say "I don't want
dialog: anything more."
dialog: (another moment)
dialog: Sixty-five years - don't they go by
dialog: in a blink?
text: Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows
text: into CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune. Quince
text: grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back. Now
text: Parrish spots Allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they
text: hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated
text: by a surge of guests. Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but
text: there is a tinge of sadness about her. He heads towards her,
text: they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What a night.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I'm having a helluva time.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You were right about Joe, he is
dialog: going somewhere --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: (gently)
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Susan is examining Parrish very closely.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Are you relieved?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Yes, but --
text: Parrish hesitates.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: But what?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I want you to know how much I love
dialog: you. That you've given a meaning
dialog: to my life that I had no right to
dialog: expect, and that no one can ever
dialog: take from me.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Daddy --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: No -- I love you so much and I want
dialog: you to promise me something. I
dialog: don't want you to ever worry about
dialog: me. If anything should happen, I'm
dialog: going to be fine and everything's
dialog: going to be all right.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: -- And I have no regrets.
text: Susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: And I want you to feel that way,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I love you, Daddy --
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: That's why it's okay.
text: They drift into silence.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: No regrets?
dialog: After a moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: 'No regrets'.
text: A long silence, Susan smiles.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: It's a good feeling, isn't it?
dialog: Silence again.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Everybody's saying goodbye...
text: They regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an
dialog: understanding.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I'm still here.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Would you like to dance with me,
dialog: Susan?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, yes --
text: He starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: If you don't mind dancing with an
dialog: old fogey like me.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, Dad, you're not old. You'll
dialog: never be old.
text: He takes her in his arms and they dance away.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: On a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still
text: commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe. His eyes are on
text: Parrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully.
text: A Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Can I get you anything, sir?
text: Joe regards the Waiter for a moment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Do you have any peanut butter?
text: The Waiter hesitates.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: I don't think so, sir.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thank you, anyway.
text: The Waiter moves off. Joe's attention returns to Parrish and
text: Susan, the dance number ends, a BOOM.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: On the dance floor.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: The fireworks are about to start.
text: Parrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: (to Parrish)
dialog: Shall we?
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: You go ahead, honey, I'm going to
dialog: catch my breath.
text: Suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close. She looks at
text: him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she
text: smiles back. Now she heads out with the crowd for the
text: fireworks. When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns
text: and heads up towards Joe.
text: Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Happy Birthday, Bill.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Thank you.
text: They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks.
text: Joe's gaze lingers.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Did you say goodbye?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not exactly.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I guess you have your reasons.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Now that we have a moment, would you
dialog: mind if I expressed my gratitude for
dialog: what you did for Susan?
dialog: Joe waits.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: I never heard her speak of any man
dialog: as she spoke of you -- It was always
dialog: what I wanted for her -- but what
dialog: happens to her now?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I wouldn't worry about it, Bill.
dialog: These things have a way of working
dialog: out.
text: Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish
dialog: has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues:
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: And would you mind if I expressed my
dialog: gratitude...?
dialog: Parrish waits.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: For you. For the time you've given
dialog: me. For the person you are.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll
dialog: ruin my autopsy.
text: Joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the
text: crowd below, searching.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: It's hard to let go, isn't it?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: That's life. What can I tell you?
text: A silence, an understanding there is another more to say.
text: Joe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say "Shall we?",
text: Parrish nods and Joe turns with him. They set off now away
text: from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking
dialog: the river.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Down below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial
text: fireworks display. Among them is Susan, but her interest
text: isn't there. Not something pulls her attention, an over-
text: powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a
text: distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow. Some-
text: thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens
text: her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the
dialog: fireworks.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Up the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him.
speaker_heading: PARRISH
dialog: I'm getting a little dizzy, I can
dialog: feel my heart pumping --
text: But Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on
text: up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: PARRISH (cont'd)
dialog: Should I be afraid?
text: Joe stops, Parrish stops with him.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not a man like you.
text: Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides
text: out again, Joe right with him. In tandem they continue
text: on and disappear over the crest of the hill. A barrage
text: of fireworks lights up the sky.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks
text: up towards the hill. There is nobody there. She hesitates,
text: now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she
text: walks up towards the hill.
text: Susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from
text: over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared.
text: He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out,
text: seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if
text: pulled by a magnet. Now she stops again. It is a man, he
text: keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Joe...?
text: He smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right
text: in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so
text: appealing. They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: You're here...
text: He is trying to get his bearings.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- You bet.
text: Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Where did you go?
text: Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of
dialog: time and place.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't know -- y'know, I don't know
dialog: -- it's all blurred up and hazy. And
dialog: would y'know what I mean if I said I
dialog: don't think it's worth figuring out?
text: Some realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her
dialog: lightheaded.
speaker_heading: JOE (cont'd)
dialog: ...But now I'm back.
text: Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, I don't know what else to say.
dialog: It's a helluva party --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah...and you're the prettier
dialog: thing here.
text: Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his
text: jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she
text: regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling
text: with the last moments fades away.
text: Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shaken,
text: a sudden intake of breath.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Hey, you all right?
text: His hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her
dialog: support.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: The coffee shop --
text: The Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I asked you if I said something
dialog: wrong and you said it was so right
dialog: it scared you.
text: Susan holds herself very still.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
dialog: And forgive me for saying this --
dialog: but then you said -- and it's been
dialog: with me ever since --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What has --?
text: He hesitates.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You said you liked me.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Y'didn't?
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I said I liked you so much.
text: She falls silent now, overcome by the last moments'
text: revelations. The Young Man senses her discomfort which
text: is on the edge of pain.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Hey, everything's going great --
dialog: don't y'think?
text: She doesn't answer for a moment.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
dialog: Don't you feel that way?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: ...We know so little about each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: But we've got time.
text: She searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open,
text: completely vulnerable, waiting for her response. A long
text: silence, the words come out haltingly:
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I wish you could've known my
dialog: father...
dialog: Another moment.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Me, too.
text: Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are
text: completely intent on each other.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: ...What do we do now?
text: A long silence.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: It will come to us.
text: Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes
text: up from below, the night fills with light. The Young Man
text: searches Susan's face, now takes her hand -- and together
text: they start back towards the party.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
