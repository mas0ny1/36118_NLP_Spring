text: His demeanor is gentle, philosophical. Almost a shrink's
dialog: probing bedside manner. He has great interest in the world
text: as he moves through it. As if he originally came from a
dialog: different world and his survival in this one depends on close
dialog: continual observation and analysis.
dialog: 
text: YOUNG COLIN looks up. CLOSE ON his eyes. He is fourteen or

dialog: 
text: COSTELLO eyes the proprietor's TEENAGE DAUGHTER, working

dialog: (whaling him in the beats)
dialog: But I'm still fucking arresting
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: COLIN is hammered to his knees. Head down, blood in his
text: hair, drooling blood, thinking (impossibly) about his next
text: move. He seems to realize he's fucked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: [You are what you do.] Get up.
dialog: (COLIN doesn't move.)
dialog: I said get the fuck up.
dialog: 
text: BILLY grabs the back of Colin's collar and puts the gun to
text: Colin's head. A crunch of gravel, off. BILLY and COLIN both
dialog: hear it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROWN
text: Put down the weapon and step away
dialog: from Sergeant Sullivan.
dialog: 
text: BILLY drags COLIN to his feet and using Colin as a shield

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I called you. You specifically.

speaker_heading: BROWN
text: Put the weapon on the ground and

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He was Costello's rat. I got

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Maybe you do, but right now I need

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I told you I've got the evidence

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I am killing you.
dialog: 
text: The doors open and for a frozen moment BILLY, holding the gun
text: on COLIN, stares out of the car. A LOUD BANG. BILLY is shot
text: through the head. BLOOD sprays the walls, and COLIN is hit by
text: flying blood and matter. BILLY falls, crumpled, on his face,
text: half in and half out of the elevator. The doors try to
text: close...open...COLIN, covered with blood, looks up.
dialog: 
text: BARRIGAN lowers his pistol.
dialog: 
text: COLIN slumps, covered with blood. BARRIGAN uncuffs him. COLIN
text: feels his wrists. BARRIGAN picks up BILLY'S gun. The other

text: bloody elevator and down at the dead man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: (holstering his gun)
dialog: Shit...
dialog: 
text: BARRIGAN raises BILLY'S GUN and shoots BROWN in the head.
text: COLIN stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRIGAN
dialog: Did you think you were the only one
dialog: he had? Costello was going to sell
dialog: us to the FBI. It's you and me now.
dialog: We have to take care of each other.
dialog: You understand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: All right. Give me that.

scene_heading: EXT. THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who
dialog: I now understand to have been
dialog: Francis Costello's informer in SIU,
dialog: intercepted us in the lobby and
dialog: shot Trooper William Costigan once
text: in the head.
dialog: (drinks water)
dialog: At that time Barrigan retrieved
dialog: Trooper Costigan's undercover
text: weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he
dialog: was approaching our location. I
dialog: attempted to subdue Trooper
dialog: Barrigan and in the ensuing
dialog: struggle was struck several times
dialog: with the Walther pistol. I was
text: able to wrestle the weapon away, at
dialog: which time Barrigan drew his own
text: weapon and took aim at me. I was
text: able to get off a single shot,
dialog: striking Barrigan in the head. I
dialog: then checked for vital signs of
dialog: Troopers Brown and Costigan and
dialog: discovered that they had expired.
dialog: 
text: COLIN looks up, eyes clear, perfectly believable. As we
text: transition to the FUNERAL...bagpipes coming up.

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY. DAY
dialog: 
text: BILLY'S GRAVESITE. The same cemetery as his mother is buried
text: in. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN (not only State, but MDC, the way
text: they do it, for "brother officers"), saluting.
dialog: 
text: MADOLYN is at the gravesite, dry-eyed though in, distinctly
text: apart from COLIN. He looks at her. She looks away from him,

speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: What about the baby?

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE STAIRWAY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: COLIN has a bag of expensive groceries and wine. Living the
text: Beacon Hill dream. He climbs the steps slowly. He nods to a
text: neighbor, an old lady coming down with her dog (who
dialog: incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and COLIN
text: briefly seems aware of this). (Don't be afraid to get a bit
text: French here). He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and
text: nearly crumples. But he gets the door open. He looks up and
text: sees a gun. Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows,
text: DIGNAM. Avenging a guy he didn't even like, because it's the
text: right thing to do. COLIN looks down and sees that Dignam has
text: plastic hospital boots on his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLIN
dialog: (accepting it, sort of,
dialog: but only in a COLIN way)
dialog: OK.
dialog: 
text: DIGNAM fires. Flash groceries fall all over the floor.
text: DIGNAM'S FEET step over COLIN's body, crushing one of a half
text: dozen croissants, and DIGNAM goes down the expensive
text: staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open. The
text: strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the
text: dead man's croissants. The rat hears something and runs so
dialog: it's not in the shot when it
