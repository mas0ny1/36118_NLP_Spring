dialog: fake. I mean, come on, solid red-
text: Guard 2 is cleaning his gun.
speaker_heading: GUARD 2
dialog: And what's with his forehead? Is that
dialog: goggles?
text: He looks out the window and sees the THE SHADOWY FIGURE
text: standing by the gates.
speaker_heading: GUARD 2 (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, we got us a wino.
text: He grabs his nightstick and steps outside.
dialog: 35
scene_heading: 35 EXT. RAILYARD - NIGHT
text: Waving his nightstick, Guard 2 approaches the intruder.
text: Their elongated shadows loom up above them on a brick wall.
speaker_heading: GUARD 2
dialog: Hey- buddy- get the-
text: The THE SHADOWY FIGURE whirls and drops his coat. He
text: unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the air around the
dialog: guard.
text: The guard's shadow in the background is cut into three parts
text: and collapses.
dialog: 36
scene_heading: 36 INT. GUARD SHACK - NIGHT
text: Guard 1 tunes in a game show. Looks outside-
text: -no sign of his buddy. Behind him, at the window, WINK
text: appears. Its MASSIVE ARM punches through the wall and hauls
text: off the GUARD and then slams his massive IRON MACE down!!!
dialog: BAMMKM ! ! ! !
text: THE SHADOWY FIGURE wipes off his sword over the crumpled
text: remains of Guard 2. Screams and bone crunching can be heard.
text: WINK emerges from behind the shack.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 19
text: Effortlessly, the SHADOWY FIGURE vaults the chainlink fence
text: and walks into the roundhouse. WINK smashes the fence and
text: follows him through.
scene_heading: 37 INT. ROUNDHOUSE - NIGHT 37
text: A few pigeons flutter through a forest of steel pillars.
text: Radiant fingers of moonlight shine on the old train tracks.
text: THE SHADOWY FIGURE and WINK stop as a dozen ROYAL GUARDS in
text: helmets and light armor march out from a tunnel.
text: After a pause, a CHAMBERLAIN joins them. He bows low in a
text: show of respect for the Shadowy Figure.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Prince Nuada- He awaits you- Please,
dialog: follow me, Sire.
scene_heading: 38 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 38
text: The Chamberlain leads the way down a tunnel lined with more
text: guards. The armed men surround the Prince as they stop at an
dialog: intersection.
text: The Prince prepares to unsheathe his sword- WINK growls.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: I beg you, your majesty. Before entering
dialog: the chamber you surrender your sword.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: I will not.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Then, I regret to say, you may not see
dialog: your father. It is the protocol, sire.
dialog: For peasant and prince alike. Please- for
dialog: the last time- surrender your sword.
text: A tense beat and then the Prince relents.
text: The guards accept his weapon, carefully pat him down-
speaker_heading: PRINCE
text: Mr. Wink however- cannot dispose of his
dialog: weapon. He will wait here-
text: WINK snorts as the Prince is finally escorted through a
text: huge, rusting iron door.

scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 20
scene_heading: 39 INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT 39
text: An abandoned machine shop functions as a council chamber.
text: High-ranking heads of outlandish MAGICK FAMILIES are there:
text: goblins, trolls, dwarves and elves.
text: At the center sits KING BALOR The One-armed King of Elfland
text: and, behind him, the willowy, beautiful PRINCESS NUALA, the
dialog: Prince's sister.
text: Both on the King's chest and her own, a large golden piece
text: dangles from a chain.
text: Nuala's resemblance to the Prince is uncanny, down to the
text: fine scars marring their perfect faces. They're YING and
text: YANG, almost the same being.
text: The Prince eyes the doors closing behind him. The armed
text: guards watch his every move.
text: He bows his head and kneels.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: Father.
dialog: (eyes the Princess)
speaker_heading: SISTER-
text: The KING gestures for him to rise.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Why have you done this??
text: His voice trembles with anger.
speaker_heading: KING (CONT'D)
dialog: Why? !
text: The Prince looks at him, defiant.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: I have returned from exile to set us
dialog: free. All of us, Father- And to reclaim
dialog: what has been taken from our people. The
dialog: land and the freedom that is rightfully
dialog: ours.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: No- You have broken a truce that has
dialog: lasted for centuries.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 21
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: A shameful truce, worth nothing. How can
dialog: you abide it? How- ? They have no respect
dialog: for themselves, their Gods or the earth-
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And they scorn us- every time they raise
text: a dead, cold building, destroy a forest,
dialog: or take more land-
text: The PRINCESS then steps forward.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS
dialog: What they do is in their nature. We must
dialog: honor our side of the agreement-
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: Honor-?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Look at this place. Is this where you
dialog: hold court??
speaker_heading: (BEAT )
dialog: Is this how we are to live?? Amidst their
dialog: filth, in their rubble??? Picking at
text: scraps from their table??? Where is the
dialog: honor in that??
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: And what would your solution be-? War?
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: It may just be that our days are ended...
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: It may be- but we will not go quiet. We
dialog: will not fade like this. Better to burn
dialog: than fade away... And for this...
text: Prince Nuada looks around, locking eyes with the heads of
dialog: the clans.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: .we'll need the help of the Good... the
dialog: Bad... and the Worst-
text: He brings out the gold artifact from the auction. Holds it
text: high.
text: The crowds GASPS. The King instinctively covers the
text: companion piece hanging from his chest as a medallion.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: No- you cannot be that mad-
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 22
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: Yes. I am.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: This is the path you wish to take?
dialog: Knowing the cost?
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: Yes, Father- it is.
text: The King takes the Princess' hand and mournfully lowers his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Then, I am sorry my son- you leave me no
dialog: choice.
dialog: (looks at his guards)
dialog: Death.
text: His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
speaker_heading: (GRIM)
dialog: I agree. Death it is-
text: And the guards turn toward the king and stab him. The
text: Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch
text: tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to
text: flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: Hear me all!!! There are some amongst you
dialog: that have already seen the light-
dialog: (he nears the guards)
dialog: Seen the future...
text: The PRAETORIAN GUARDS cover his back as he leans forward to
text: his Father"s corpse and snatches the medallion.
speaker_heading: PRINCE (CONT'D)
dialog: As for you- You may join us in our quest
dialog: or die now-
text: His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together,
text: they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of
text: NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces
text: seamlessly into an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raises
dialog: IT-
speaker_heading: PRINCE (CONT'D)
text: All of those in favor, make it known.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 23
text: All of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads, then
dialog: kneel.
speaker_heading: PRINCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Good- I see the council is as brave as
dialog: it's always been...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And now, my sister-
text: The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone.
text: He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door.
speaker_heading: PRINCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Find her- Find her-
text: His minions surge into the tunnels.
scene_heading: 40 TNT. TUNNEL MAZE - NIGHT 40
text: Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs
text: down a tunnel. A CROWD gathers behind her, chasing her as
text: she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel.
text: With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down
text: a chute.
text: She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves.
scene_heading: 41 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - DAY 41
text: The Princess rushes to a small cabinet. She grabs an
text: ancient, leather-bound tome.
text: She turns to leave, but a horde of TROLLS rushes and quickly
text: surrounds her. One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty
dialog: sword.
text: It opens a gash in the princess' left arm-
scene_heading: 42 INT. TUNNEL 1 - DAY 42
text: The Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the PRAETORIAN
text: GUARDS, suddenly doubles over, cursing. Blood pours from a
text: wound in his left arm.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: No- no- you fools-
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 24
scene_heading: 43 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 43
text: As another troll lifts his sword high-
speaker_heading: PRINCESS
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Yrdrig!!
text: YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an
text: alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious. In
text: seconds, he's upon the TROLLS.
text: Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and
text: shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls.
text: The Princess slips through a secret door.
scene_heading: 44 INT. TUNNEL 2 -- SAME 44
text: The Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll
text: screams echo off the walls.
dialog: When they finally-
scene_heading: 45 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - SAME 45
text: -reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late.
text: Dead and dying TROLLS lie in a heap on the floor.
text: The Prince finds no sign of his sister. He clutches his
text: bleeding arm.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 46 INT. HELLBOY'S ROOM - DAY 46
text: Liz sprawls on a sofa, watching the 20-odd TV monitors in
text: Hellboy's room. All the news channels feature footage of
text: Heliboy's "outing" the night before.
text: HB is grinning at the camera. Now he's signing an autograph!
scene_heading: HELLBOY ON TV
dialog: Yes- yes- I'd say I am that strong- I've
dialog: fought many creatures over the years but
dialog: none as strong as me-
text: He winks at camera. Liz rolls her eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 25
text: Hellboy plunks himself down next to her, popping a can of
dialog: beer.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: I think I did good. And I looked good,
dialog: don't you think, Liz?
text: Abe stands behind them, juggling a dozen remote controls.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Look- there's Manning...
text: He raises the volume as Manning is shown, surrounded by
text: microphones.
scene_heading: MANNING ON TV
dialog: Evidently we have a- gas pocket-
dialog: somewhere in-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: A gas pocket??!! Ha-! I love it.
text: The door opens. Manning is there, holding a plastic box
text: overflowing with mail.
speaker_heading: MANNING
speaker_heading: PLEASE-
text: Disgusted, Manning turns off the TV's.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Aw- this is a disaster! A disaster- you
text: hear?? Worse than Cheney with a shotgun.
dialog: Only Liz-
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Only Liz handled herself with any
dialog: dignity.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (glancing at HB)
dialog: No one asked me anything.
text: Manning pulls a fistful of mail out and tosses it on a
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Don't bother starting a fan club. It's
dialog: trending five to one against us.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Against?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 26
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (glances at some letters)
dialog: Polls- protests- hate mail-
text: Liz grabs a few letters and scans them.
speaker_heading: LIZ
speaker_heading: (READING)
dialog: "Unwelcome species... mongrelizing...
dialog: lower orders... ungodly freaks..."
text: She glares at Hellboy.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Ungodly freaks-? Us?
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: You really did it this time- I'm under
dialog: review.
dialog: (to Hellboy)
dialog: But so are you- As of today, there's a
text: new team leader.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: New - ? What?
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Yes- You heard me. A new team leader.
dialog: We're to meet him at the conference room
dialog: at 0900-
text: (looks at his watch)
dialog: Now.
scene_heading: 47 INT. SECURITY POUND BPRD - SAME 47
text: The SECURITY POUND is row after row of stacked cages, each
text: one imprisoning a different CREATURE. BPRD AGENTS patrol the
text: pens, feeding the occupants, cleaning the pans-
text: HB looks at Manning, who is edgy and nervous.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: What's the matter, Manning?? Don't you
dialog: trust me anymore?
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Oh- I never did- But after last night,
dialog: Washington wants a new public face for
dialog: the BPRD-
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 27
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: What about me? What's wrong with my
dialog: face???
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Or mine??? The press loves me!! But now
dialog: you've ruined it all-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: But, who-? Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: How would I know? Evidently, he's quite
dialog: the big shot-
text: (he reads a file)
dialog: His name is Johann Kraus-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Akkk- Kraus??? He's German-
speaker_heading: MANNING
speaker_heading: (OVERLAPPING)
dialog: -a physical medium, head of the European
dialog: branch of the BPRD-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
speaker_heading: (OVERLAPPING)
dialog: You know I have a problem with Germans-
speaker_heading: MANNING
speaker_heading: (OVERLAPPING)
dialog: -a Doctor in Philosophy and Occult
dialog: Practice from the University of Munich
dialog: and a very eloquent speaker-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
speaker_heading: (OVERLAPPING)
dialog: -Germans make me nervous-
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: I guess they need a nice open face- A
dialog: face people can trust.
text: Finally, next to steel cage, they meet-
text: JOHANN KRAUS: about 6' tall, dressed in a canvas containment
text: suit full of tubes and taps. His hands are encased in thick
text: latex gloves with exit valves at the fingertips and his
dialog: head...
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: . Oh, my God-
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 28
text: .is a translucent glass bubble, full of gas!
text: He is studying a drawing of the royal seal we saw on the
dialog: Fairy Cages.
text: Johann approaches Liz. He takes her hand and bows.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Johann Kraus, at your service.
text: His unearthly voice is velvety and warm. Almost soothing.
text: Liz smiles. Hellboy glowers as Kraus' fishbowl head turns
text: toward them.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (whispers to manning)
dialog: That's an open face for you...
scene_heading: 48 INT. CONTAINMENT AREA - DAY 48
text: Johann pulls out one of the dead, singed Fairies. Hellboy
text: and the others gather around him.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Poor things, bought and sold on the black
text: market. Smuggled in tight, cramped cages.
dialog: Let's see what they can remember-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Memory gets pretty sketchy after you die-
dialog: (nudges Abe)
dialog: -but maybe I can be of help-
text: Nudges Abe and starts fishing for an amulet.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Oh, no, no- No amulets are required.
text: He adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and
text: approaches the lock.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: I can inhabit inanimate things: organic,
scene_heading: MECHANICAL-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
speaker_heading: INHABIT-
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 29
speaker_heading: ABE
scene_heading: TELEPLASTY-
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Exactly.
text: A PROTOPLASMIC emanation seeps out from his fingertips,
text: slightly deflating his body. The tendrils enter the-
dialog: -"Dead" Fairy.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: I can briefly take control of entities,
dialog: both mechanical and organic and
dialog: reactivate their neural system-
text: The "dead" Fairy snarls and bares its teeth at Hellboy. Two
text: more do the same from another pen.
speaker_heading: JOHANN (CONT'D)
dialog: (points at Hellboy)
dialog: You scare him-
text: The fairy blabbers furiously while glaring at HB.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (leering at it)
dialog: Whaddayawant??? You chewed off the tip of
dialog: my tail- Yes, you-
speaker_heading: JOHANN (CONT'D)
dialog: Rough translation: He says you are rude,
dialog: brutish and not too bright-
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Touche.
text: More high-pitched jabbering...
text: Johann replaces the little fairy in the holding pen.
speaker_heading: JOHANN (CONT'D)
dialog: Enough. it seems our little friend here
text: remembers a noise. A very peculiar noise
text: in the last place where his cage was
dialog: traded: market sounds-
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Troll language-
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: The troll market- ?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 30
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Exactly, Miss Sherman.
text: The Fairy starts babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and
dialog: weak.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Jeez- your buddy there doesn't look too
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: I'm losing my grip on its limbic system-
text: He feels nauseous. I'm afraid he's about
dialog: to die-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Wow- You have that effect on me too.
text: The Fairy's cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses.
text: Ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at Johan's
dialog: fingertips.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: How can we find the Troll market??? Its
dialog: location has been a source of speculation
dialog: for centuries
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Yes, well- Trolls dwell under bridges-
dialog: And Vladimir Vanya 18th century occultist-
dialog: places it under Washington Bridge
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: We've looked there before-- Staked it out
dialog: for weeks-
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Yes, but this time I have asked for a
dialog: very special piece of equipment-
text: He moves in to a large crate marked "Lot 336"
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: "336" The schufftein glasses??
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: (smiles knowingly)
dialog: On loan from the Smithsonian. Plus we
dialog: have this clue-
text: He produces the sketch of the ROYAL SEAL.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 31
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: In my mind we have enough to go by- Any
dialog: questions??
text: Abe is about to ask something when, abruptly, Hellboy raises
dialog: his hand-
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Yes- what is it?
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: If you're really German- how come you
dialog: don't have a funny accent?
speaker_heading: JOHANN
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: Get ready. We are on the move.
dialog: 49
scene_heading: 49 INT. GARAGE AREA / DRESSING LOCKER ROOMS
text: Hellboy is suiting up. Liz and Abe do the same.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: What a moron!! "We are on the move" He
dialog: thinks he's so hot!! We've been looking
dialog: for that place for years and we've never
dialog: found it-
dialog: (looks at Abe)
dialog: You said so-
text: Abe pulls out TWO headsets of COMPOSITE GOGGLES, made of
text: copper and glass, full of buzzing and whirring pieces. He
text: tries it on.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Get used to it. He might be here for good-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: For good?!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He has a nice voice.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Yes, very commanding, very soothing.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: I think he's a jerk.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: I like him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 32
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Well, then you're a jerk, too. "The

speaker_heading: JOHANN
text: They head towards the garbage truck. Manning, Abe and
dialog: are waiting there.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I think you feel threatened...

speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Ha! Me? Threatened??
text: Glaring, at Liz:
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: By whom? By him??
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Not just him- this whole thing you did.
dialog: The TV- the reporters-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: I did that?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Yes, Red- absolutely. 'Cause you did it
dialog: without thinking- You just wanted to be
dialog: in the public's eye- well- you're there-
dialog: but so are we.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Hey- We got some hate mail.
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: We'll deal with it. Together.

speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 33
text: He comes closer to her.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Something else bothering you-?

speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: So- Tell me about it-
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I will, but not now- I'm sorry if- I-
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I don't like being watched. I never have.
dialog: I feel like a freak only if someone's
dialog: watching me.
text: Suddenly: Angry YELLS... then fists pounding the walls and

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 52 EXT. WATERFRONT, BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT 52

text: Some of them chase run alongside the vehicle, carrying
dialog: support/hatred signs.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: May I suggest that tonight you refrain
text: from signing autographs.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: It's the garbage truck. It makes the

speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: You think that's what this is about?

speaker_heading: REPORTER 2
dialog: C'mon- show us your powers-
speaker_heading: ABE

speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Very well, if you insist.

text: A shrieking CAMERA CREW runs up loaded with video equipment.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: You! Demon-man! Will you take a DNA test?
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: It's "Hellboy" not "Demon-man"-
text: One of the projectiles hits him. The crowd roars. Hellboy

speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Let me take care of this.

speaker_heading: WE-

speaker_heading: JOHANN (CONT'D)
dialog: In due time- very soon- we will provide

text: An egg hits him in the face- hard. The crowd roars-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Great P.R...
text: He gets ready to pummel the crowd. Liz stops him.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shh! Give him a chance...
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: -it's been a long... long time... for
dialog: many decades really, that the BPRD has
dialog: served you- all of you... in silence. We
dialog: have waged an unknown war - but a very

dialog: unrecognized so that you might go about
dialog: your daily life. To work, to marry, to
dialog: bid your children goodnight.
text: Little by little, the crowd grows quiet.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: In exchange, we have been consigned to
dialog: the lies and racist innuendo of the

text: At kiosks and shops, Trolls peddle cats (skinned or alive)
text: cadres of Lovecraftian entities stroll about: Mer-men,
text: Goblins and a few select species unknown to any cosmology.
text: A dogfight of sorts is taking place in a small ring. Instead
text: of pitbulls, multi-limbed creatures leap at one another
text: while violent bettors laugh and shout.
text: At the rail, Abe watches in horror, then sees a woman in

speaker_heading: ABE

speaker_heading: PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)

text: Abe, shielding the Princess, demonstrates the way of the

text: Abe scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at

dialog: up through the Bridge overpass!!
text: Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into
text: the moonlit clouds.
text: Hellboy approaches the massive, trunk, gazing up in

text: Chinatown looks like the Garden of Eden.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa. Just like the story books.
text: Manning and Liz take a few steps into it: a SQUIRREL-BEING

text: BOOM!! the trunk rips in two, revealing a curled, dormant
scene_heading: ELEMENTAL.
text: Five stories high- Fierce as nature. THE ELEMENTAL steps out
text: of the tree and stares at Hellboy.
text: Uttering a weird, guttural SOUND, the Giant raises an arm
text: and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK!
text: WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight,
text: turning his baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks
text: back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling. In a
text: single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Good dog.
dialog: (to Elemental)
dialog: Now, Woody... You want to fight someone,
dialog: you fight with me.
text: Hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose, as in Bruce Lee.

speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (to the Princess)
dialog: This may not be the best place for you,
dialog: your majesty. With your permission...

dialog: ground where they had been standing!
text: Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and

text: Elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding. Growing
text: and discarding branches and roots.
scene_heading: 89 INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 89
text: Hellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated KITCHEN.
text: Behind him, the Elemental's massive BRANCH/FIST crashes
text: through the wall, then pursues him as he runs down a

text: Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section

speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: That's nine blocks from here, Fishbowl!
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: You'll figure it out.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: What's at the bridge? Abe - ? Liz?
dialog: Hello???
text: No answer. Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing
text: neon sign reading "Hotel".
text: The Elemental smashes the letters "tel"... so Hellboy climbs
text: the "0" to the roof.
scene_heading: 91 INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - SAME 91
text: Liz drives the garbage truck toward the Brooklyn Bridge.
text: Johann is sitting next to her.
scene_heading: 92 EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 92
text: Hellboy makes a running start and leaps off the building. He
text: sails over the alley, reaches for the approaching cornice...
text: and almost loses his grip! He hangs on for dear life.
text: Behind him, the Elemental appears, climbing onto an adjacent
text: roof. As his feet smash through the skylights, the Elemental
text: pulls down a WATER TOWER. A wall of water rolls toward
dialog: Hellboy, like an ocean wave!
text: Hellboy leaps to the next roof... and the water shoots over
text: the edge of the building, cascading onto the street below.
scene_heading: 93 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME 93

speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Yes. I had the very same idea...
text: He gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine

speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (gazing at the controls)
dialog: .but how do you operate this??
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: If you'll permit me...
text: Johann opens his fingers, and plunges both arms deep into
text: the mechanism! Instantly, the diesel engine STARTS UP.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: (to Abe)
dialog: Stand back, Abe.
text: A hydraulic strut lifts the spool, then pitches it through
text: the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable. It splashes down
text: near the far shore of the East River.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
text: Now, tie it onto the pontoons on the
dialog: other side.
dialog: (seeing Hellboy coming)
dialog: Quickly, Abe!
scene_heading: 94 IN THE WATER 94

dialog: shore.
scene_heading: 95 BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS 95

text: The cable is a yard short of the anchor point! Abe tugs on

speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: No more available!
text: The Elemental's feet stomp through the river; he stumbles as
text: he encounters the submerged cable.
dialog: 97
speaker_heading: 97 UNDERWATER
text: Clinging to the cable, Abe is dragged down, down down...
text: past rusting cars, oil drums... and a couple of rotting

text: Suddenly, Abe's head strikes a sunken truck, knocking him
text: unconscious. Blood seeps from his wound.

dialog: calling out from above:
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: (to Hellboy)
dialog: Haven't you managed to kill it yet? You,
dialog: who were so eager for a fight?
text: The Prince is standing on top of the tower. He points at
text: Hellboy, then yells at the Elemental.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: (to the Elemental)
dialog: Over here, dear friend...
text: SNATCH! The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy
text: wriggles in the massive wooden finger-like appendages.

speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 62

speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: This might be a good chance for you to
dialog: come to your senses. Help us.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: I've been all through this! The answer's
dialog: still no!
text: Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable,
text: bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a
dialog: steel snake!
text: The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the
text: Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cable
speaker_heading: TENSES-
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: (to Liz)
dialog: Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i
text: He points at the roots trailing into the river. Liz
text: concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out
text: of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet.
text: Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the
text: river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he
text: tosses Hellboy high into the air.
text: On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings
text: back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the
text: Elemental's back, right behind his head.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Nap time, Big guy-
text: He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back
text: of the neck.
dialog: The cable tenses-
dialog: -The Elemental pitches forward-
text: The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at
text: him; his mouth opens as if to scream...
text: The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop
text: the bridge... exactly where the Prince had been standing.
text: Putting an end, it seems, to both of them.

speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 63
text: The Creature dies, but even as it does, its branches embrace

text: of the city are now covered in trees and grass and mossy
text: leaves... A strangely beatific and precious change.
text: Liz runs up, looking out at the river as Abe emerges,
text: bleeding, but alive. Abe, Liz and Johann embrace firmly,

speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: You'll permit a small criticism? You take

dialog: Not my style. Watch and learn, fish bowl.

text: his knees; as he rises, Hellboy connects with a brutal
dialog: combination.
text: In the arms of the troll, the Princess' head rockets back
text: and forth, as if struck. A moan of pain escapes from her
text: lips.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (seeing this)
dialog: H.B., no! Stop - you mustn't harm him!

speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 87
text: Hellboy grimaces and looks down: the Prince's SPEAR TIP is

text: The Prince sneers and gives the spear a savage yank,
text: breaking off the blade! Hellboy's eyes roll upward; Liz
text: SCREAMS. She and Johann manage to catch Hellboy as he

text: The Prince reclaims the Princess and turns to the humans.
text: His eyes seek out Abe, who has rushed to Hellboy's side.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: (showing off the Princess)

text: Stretched out on an operating table, HB is barely conscious.
text: Abe, in surgical goggles, probes the wound.
text: In CLOSE-UP, Abe's webbed fingers lightly touch the glinting
text: metal that protrudes from Hellboy's sternum. The spear tip
text: responds, as if alive; it wriggles, producing a GROAN from
speaker_heading: HB.
text: Liz is near panic.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Abe, stop studying! Pull the friggin'

speaker_heading: ABE

text: He opens it to Chapter 23 and finds the gold piece.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Any luck?

speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: No. Sorry.
speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: ABE

speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: The map contained within the cylinder

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Now the case itself proves very useful-
text: He moistens the holding cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat
text: and imprints the surface pattern on the paper map. Glyphs

text: A silhouette of a twisted, gnarly tree is visible too.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her
dialog: brother were born there. They hold it
dialog: sacred.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Even if you're right, we sit tight and

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What about Red?? Don't you care about

speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 92
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: On the contrary. I've been giving it some

text: Abe is very quiet.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (in despair)
dialog: Its useless- I- I- can't- I can't pilot

speaker_heading: PRINCE

speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: This should be the portal. By all rights-
text: Johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Abe, bring the mapcase over here.
text: He's found a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Yes! Try it, Abe-

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You're wasting time!
text: Abe inserts and twists the cylinder.

speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Dangerous, deceptive... and hard to
dialog: leave.

speaker_heading: 150 FAIRY WORLD

speaker_heading: SATYR
dialog: I'm sure you can come to an

speaker_heading: GOBLIN
dialog: Room enough for all of you!
dialog: (looks at Hellboy)
dialog: Even your weary friend.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: What will it cost, boatman?

speaker_heading: GOBLIN

speaker_heading: SATYR

speaker_heading: GOBLIN
dialog: That!

dialog: That - in exchange for your crossing!
speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: GOBLIN
dialog: Is it so precious to you? Let me pull it

speaker_heading: ABE

text: A raspy voice utters something in an ancient language. The
text: Goblin replies, gesturing at Hellboy, who collapses on the
dialog: floor.
text: In a deep coma, Hellboy lies on the floor, near the

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: And I'll deal with it when that time

scene_heading: ANGEL OF DEATH
dialog: Ach, outside with you!

scene_heading: 162 AMONG THE SOLDIERS 162
text: Hellboy leads the way down a row of gleaming statues,
text: pausing to gaze up at the blank face of one of the
text: infantrymen.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Hey, amigo. You got some gum?
text: Two rows away, Johann examines the lethal weaponry that
text: terminates the arms of each soldier.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Most ingenious. A versatile, highly
text: mobile killing machine.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Make that machines, Johann. I see more
dialog: than one.
text: Hellboy taps on a soldier's mechanical chest, which booms
text: faintly, sending ECHOES up into the dark cavern.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Wow. You hear that? Listen -
text: He thumps it, harder. The mechanical thing rocks
dialog: backwards...
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Uh oh.
text: CRASH!!! The thing falls onto the soldier behind it! Then,
dialog: -
text: the ear-shattering noise of a hundred car wrecks builds as
text: - a toppling LINE OF SOLDIERS races away like falling
dialog: dominoes!!
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Whoops.
text: The sound dwindles, then builds again as ANOTHER LINE of
text: falling soldiers bears down on them!!
text: Liz screams and Hellboy pulls her aside. The soldiers crash
dialog: past them until -
text: - the din suddenly stops. The PRINCE stands revealed at the
text: head of the column.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 105
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: As a boy, they say I enjoyed toy
dialog: soldiers. So do you, I see.
text: He strolls past the mechanical figures, pausing to kick
text: aside some of the weapons.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: (to Hellboy)
dialog: You're bleeding. Most unfortunate.
text: Hellboy wipes at his oozing chest wound.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Yeah. Now it's your turn.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: Do you envy these contraptions? They
dialog: never bleed. They feel nothing. Not even
text: the zest of combat.
text: The Prince circles them, keeping an eye on Johann.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: These fighting men are the very model of
dialog: patience... merely awaiting word from
text: their lawful commander.
speaker_heading: AS
text: From his tunic, he brings forth two of the gold segments.
dialog: he fits them together...
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: You have the remaining piece, I presume.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: We do not -
speaker_heading: PRINCE
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: Then you are most foolish.
text: He gestures to some troll GUARDS near a tunnel entrance.
text: They lead the Princess out in chains.
speaker_heading: PRINCE (CONT'D)
dialog: You came here expecting what? Mercy?
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: The death you would unleash will never
dialog: happen! What you need is far from here
dialog: and will stay out of your reach forever.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 106
text: A VOICE reaches their ears from the tunnel entrance behind
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Stop - I have it.
text: Abe, dripping wet, stands there, the last gold segment in
text: the palm of his hand.
speaker_heading: ABE
speaker_heading: (APPROACHING)
dialog: Here... For her... Take it...
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Oh, my God. What has he done?
text: Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece
dialog: to the Prince.
text: Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Abe -
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (to Hellboy)
dialog: You cannot fight him- not without hurting
dialog: her...
speaker_heading: (BEAT )
dialog: What would you do if it was Liz??
text: CLICK! The Prince fits the gold parts together and places
text: the resulting crown on his head!
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: I am Prince Nuada and I command my army
dialog: to life once more. Does anyone dispute my
dialog: right?
text: With the deep sound of gears, ratchets and springs, the army
text: comes to life. Up comes the lances and shields.
speaker_heading: PRINCE (CONT'D)
dialog: (points at the team)
dialog: Kill them.
text: Abe is now aghast, seeing the Prince drag his sister back.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (to the Prince)
dialog: That was your price!! A ransom, you said -
dialog: paid in good faith!!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 107
speaker_heading: ABE(continued)
dialog: (to Hellboy)
dialog: Why, he lied to us!
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Abe old buddy. If we survive this, we
dialog: need to talk.
text: The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four
text: friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: He - he's a cad! Can you imagine, a
text: highborn heir to the throne, last in a
dialog: noble line of-
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Not now, Abe, okay?
text: The first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them, their
text: terrifying weapons slashing in unison. Hellboy brings out
text: his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and
text: swings it like a club.
text: A couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop
text: back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Let me -
text: Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each
text: hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the
text: oncoming fighters.
text: The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening
text: scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains
text: hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming,
text: marching on and over their scorched comrades.
text: Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it
text: his best. His wound is running with fresh blood.
text: He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against
text: his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy
text: groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect.
text: At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the
text: wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Invincibility!? So - the only one thing
dialog: may stop them -
text: Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self
text: flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 108
text: Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts
text: chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as
dialog: Johann rips into the enemy!!
text: But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen. As
text: the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell
text: is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically
dialog: dismember it like marauding insects!
text: As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless,
text: Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Ach. They are too many. Anyone have
dialog: another idea?
text: Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (a bellow)
dialog: Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to
dialog: command this army!
text: With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All
text: the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a
text: ledge with his sister.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (follows HB)
dialog: No= please- no-
text: Hellboy moves away from him.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: A challenge must be answered! Raise your
dialog: sword!
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: A challenge from you? A nobody?? You are
dialog: no one.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS
dialog: No!! He is Anung-un-Rma- son of the
dialog: Fallen one- He has the right!
text: Her eyes lock with Abe's: there's no other way.
text: The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks
text: up his sword.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HELLBOY 2 10 9
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: Very well.
dialog: (to the BPRD team)
dialog: May his fate show you the cost of pride
dialog: and blindness.
text: As the hall rings with their first blows of their swords-
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Hellboy's too weak-
text: Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to
text: drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where
text: they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army.
text: Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe
text: looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep
text: parrying off his enemy.
text: Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in
text: dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond.
text: The Prince is ready to kill him.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (witness to a nightmare)
dialog: No!! NO! !
text: A sudden movement at the ledge, where the Princess steps
dialog: forward and...
text: Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right
text: arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger.
text: Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away
text: red with blood. He looks over at his sister.
text: They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and
dialog: hatred.
text: Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly
text: raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has
dialog: the advantage.
text: He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the
text: Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: I- have- won-
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: No. You have not-
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 110
text: He impales himself on HELLBOY's sword. The blade goes
text: through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side. Hellboy
text: pulls it out, but it's too late. Both the Prince and the
text: Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded.
speaker_heading: ABE
speaker_heading: (GASPS)
dialog: NO-
text: Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his arms,
text: blinking in despair.
text: The pale young creature is now a ghostly white. She lifts
text: her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS
dialog: We'll find each other again, somewhere.
text: And she dies in his arms.
text: In the center of the arena:
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: (to Hellboy)
dialog: You... think you're any different from
dialog: me? The humans - they will tire of you.
dialog: They will disappoint you. And in the end,
dialog: they will betray you. You... are living a
dialog: lie. Your time will come again. May you
dialog: make a better choice.
text: Then, he, too, is dead. Both him and his sister turn to
text: fine, pale dust. And the wind carries away the ashes from
dialog: Abe's hands...
text: Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the Prince's head.
text: Looks at it carefully, as if considering the possibilities.
text: Suddenly, he rips it into pieces. As he crushes the first
dialog: segement...
text: . an entire division of the golden army collapses into a
dialog: heap of scrap metal!
text: Hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown and
text: another massive division of the army tumbles into junk!
text: HB is about the tear up the last segment of the crown, when
text: it explodes in his hands!
text: WHUMP! The last of the army disintegrates.
text: Hellboy confronts the Prince's frightened troll guards:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 111
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: (to the trolls)
dialog: You - and your kind! Leave here. And stay
dialog: in the shadows - where you belong.
text: As the ogres slink back into the tunnels, Liz looks at
text: Hellboy. He seems angry, stung by the Prince's last words.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
dialog: 163
scene_heading: 163 EXT. HILLS - DAY
text: The BPRD team crosses waterfalls and stone bridges, through
dialog: the magical hills.
text: Liz walks at Hellboy's side, but he avoids her glance.
dialog: 164
scene_heading: 164 EXT. TREE -- DAY
text: They reach the strange, twisted tree. Johann takes the map
text: cylinder and fits it into the slot.
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Any last minute requests?
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (very quiet)
dialog: Do it, please. I - I'm ready for the real
dialog: world now.
text: Johann turns the cylinder. The tree roots form their arch...
text: and the BPRD team walks through.
dialog: 165
scene_heading: 165 EXT. RENVYLE - DAY
text: On the other side of the tree: Manning and a bunch of agents
text: have set up spotter scopes and are gazing out over the
text: countryside, looking for them.
text: Suddenly, the team appears, literally from out of nowhere.
speaker_heading: MANNING
speaker_heading: (STARTLED)
dialog: Whoa! Where'd you come from? We were just-
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: I know, here to help. Well, I appreciate
dialog: that Manning.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELLBOY 2 112
text: Abe steps past Hellboy and removes his gunbelt and equipment
dialog: pack.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Yes, Mr. Manning. I want to thank you,
dialog: too. For all you've done for us over the
dialog: years.
text: He gives his stuff to the astonished agent.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: What? What, exactly is this?
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: I quit.
text: Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out the Samaritan and
text: shrugs off his pack, too.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Come on. You're resigning?
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Looks that way, doesn't it?
text: Hellboy starts to leave, but spins around and takes his gun
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I'll keep this.
text: He finally meets Liz's gaze. She crosses to him and takes
text: him by the arm. She walks off with Hellboy and Abe, clinging
text: tightly to the big, red daemon.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: Liz -- not you, too!?
dialog: (to Johann)
dialog: They can't do this. Stop them, Johann-
speaker_heading: JOHANN
dialog: Manning, you're an asshole.
scene_heading: 166 EXT. COASTLINE - DAY 166
text: Miles down the road, Abe stands on a promontory, staring off
text: at the ocean, which blazes with golden reflections.
text: Liz and HB sit next to each other on some mossy rocks.
text: Overhead: blue sky, puffy white clouds.

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What you said before - about us living
scene_heading: ANYWHERE-
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: I mean it! `Course, I'm thinking USA...
dialog: but, hey - you decide.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (breathing deep)
dialog: Let's find a place in the country. Clean
text: air - green hills - fresh milk from the
dialog: farm.
speaker_heading: HELLBOY
dialog: Milk? Yech.
speaker_heading: LIZ
text: A yard... With lots of room to grow in.
