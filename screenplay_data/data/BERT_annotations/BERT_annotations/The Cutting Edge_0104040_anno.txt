scene_heading: OFF THE ICE -=- JACK, ANTON, HALE, MARTIN, SEVERAL MAIDS and

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You’re still rushing the Lutz.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Maybe you just ought to go with it.

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let’s get down to business. It’s
dialog: Labor Day weekend, where do we stand?
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: First is to get Douglas eligible.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What’s that going to be like?
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: For you is like test pilot taking
dialog: driver’s exam.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And then into the sectionals?
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: We skip sectionals.

speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Hopes perhaps must be scaled back.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What’re you talking about?
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: Figure skating is not like hockey.
dialog: Team scoring most goals does not
dialog: always win. This is yery small
dialog: world. People will not be rushing
dialog: to welcome us.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: I am outsider. Douglas is freak.
dialog: Katya...well...
dialog: (he lets this go)
dialog: Let’s just say we are having three
dialog: strikes against us. To be winning

dialog: people happy. And for Rick Tuttle,
dialog: my God...
dialog: (she laughs)
dialog: I skated through fire for you.
