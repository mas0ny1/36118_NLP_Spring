dialog: "That's awful. What's it like to
dialog: freeze to death?"
text: PULL BACK: to reveal Aiken has been shot in the abdomen,

speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: "You get the shakes and pain in all
dialog: your fingers and toes. But eventually
dialog: you kind of drift off as if you're

dialog: How 'bout you? How'd you die?"

speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D
text: "Heart attack," says the first man.
dialog: "You see my wife was cheating on me.
dialog: So, I show up at home unexpectedly.
text: I burst into the bedroom. She's all

text: no one's there. I sprint up to the
dialog: attic, and just as I arrive... I had
dialog: a massive heart attack and died."
text: Baker's breathing becomes labored. He is beginning to fade.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
text: The second man shakes his head.
dialog: "That is so ironic!" "what do you
dialog: mean?" asks the first. "Well, if
dialog: you'd only stopped to look in the

text: Baker manages to turn towards Aiken, rolls his eyes, then
text: begins to gurgle, choking on his blood.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hang on, Nick. Help is on its way.
text: But there's no sign of anyone. Aiken, his own pain evident

speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
text: A blind dog walks into a saloon...
dialog: (Baker murmurs)
dialog: What is it, Nick?

scene_heading: STRETCHER BEARER #1
dialog: But, Colonel, he's as good as dead.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: That's an order.

dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No disrespect, Mister...
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Frederick Aiken.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Mr. Aiken, how many years have you?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I'm a month past 28.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Young man, you're barely older than
dialog: my son.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: The Senator would not have placed me
dialog: in this position unless he had
dialog: complete confidence in my abilities.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I take it then you've handled cases
dialog: like this before?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Ma'am, there's never been a case
dialog: like this before.
speaker_heading: MARY,
dialog: But, you have defended others?
text: Aiken is silent.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I see they've left nothing to chance.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I take it then you'd prefer to conduct
dialog: your own defense?
text: A beat. Off Mary's silence, Aiken opens his notes.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Very well. I understand you own a
dialog: boardinghouse at 604 H Street, is
dialog: that correct?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes.
text: Aiken awaits more information. Mary offers none.
dialog: 24.
dialog: Ma'am, all I know about you is what
dialog: I've read in the papers. And what
dialog: they're reporting isn't flattering.
text: Mary grudgingly.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I moved there a year ago with my son
dialog: and daughter after my husband passed
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: The conspirators were frequent
dialog: visitors to your boardinghouse, were
dialog: they not?
text: Aiken doesn't even bother to call them alleged conspirators.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: As were many others.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: But, you don't deny having been
dialog: acquainted with John Wilkes Booth
dialog: or the other prisoners behind bars?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No, sir. I do not.
dialog: (sternly)
dialog: Mr. Aiken, my husband died a drunk
dialog: leaving me with loads of debt.
dialog: I had no other way to support my
dialog: family, except by renting rooms to
dialog: boarders. I considered those men
dialog: customers, nothing more.
speaker_heading: / AIKEN ; ;
dialog: Did you 'consider' their sentiments?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I did not inquire as to their
dialog: "sentiments,' sir.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: What about yours, ma'am?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I am a Southerner by birth, a
dialog: Christian by belief, and a devoted
dialog: mother above all else. And I am NO
dialog: assassin!
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Ma'am, your freedom will depend on
dialog: far more assurance than that.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well, then you tell me what I should
dialog: say to those Generals?
text: A beat.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Nothing. The rules prohibit you
dialog: from testifying in your own defense.
dialog: I suppose you know of someone else
dialog: who would? Your son, John, perhaps.
dialog: Any idea where he might be?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I do not. Even at 21, Mr. Aiken
dialog: he's still my baby. My son will be
dialog: kept out of this.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: That won't be easy, ma'am. He's on
dialog: the wanted poster.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: How about his roommate, Louis
dialog: Wiechmann? Shall I call on him to
dialog: testify?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Louie is like a member of my family.
dialog: I don't want any harm coming to him
dialog: on account of me.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Is there anyone I can call upon to
dialog: give your version of events?
speaker_heading: MARY _ ; ;
dialog: Who are they calling to give their
dialog: version?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: The Government is not revealing its
dialog: list of witnesses, or the evidence
dialog: it plans to use against you.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: They can't do that, can they?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
text: This is a military proceeding in
dialog: which the Government can do just
dialog: about anything it chooses. Of course,
dialog: it makes preparing a defense more
dialog: difficult.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Of course. But what difference does
dialog: it make? Even these failing eyes of
dialog: mine can see those Generals made up
dialog: 
dialog: their minds -- just by the way they
dialog: were looking at me.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: "Looking" at you?
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Just like you, Colonel.
text: A GUARD appears with Mary's dinner, hardly appetizing. Aiken
text: heads for the door.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I must go.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Mr. Aiken
dialog: (Aiken stops)
dialog: I haven't a word from my daughter
dialog: since they put me here. Would you
dialog: check on her for me? Please.
text: He reluctantly nods.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Aiken. I see you've
dialog: got a spark of human feeling in you
dialog: after all.

dialog: I know who you are, Mr. Aiken.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Then you know I'm representing your
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: ANNA SURRATT
dialog: I was under the impression you could
dialog: not -- or rather, "would not".

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I'm sorry you heard that. It was

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Are you afraid or just embarrassed
dialog: to be seen with me, Mr. Aiken?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Your mother asked that I check on
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: If you will be so kind, please tell
dialog: her not to worry.
text: She begins to close the door.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Actually, I was hoping to get a look
dialog: inside.

scene_heading: INT. VESTIBULE -- CONTINUOUS
text: As Aiken enters the boardinghouse, he surveys the scene.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Are you the only one here?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Business tends to slow down when
text: there's a soldier stationed out front
dialog: day and night for my "protection".
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I'll take that as a "yes"?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
text: Aiken moves from room-to-room -- each strikingly cozy and
text: familial. DAGUERREOTYPES of the Surratts line the mantels.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: It's perfect.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Pardon.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Sorry, it's nothing.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please, do tell.
text: Aiken says nothing.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Aiken, I'm sure I've heard much
dialog: worse in the past month.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Very well. I was thinking this would
dialog: be the perfect place to conspire to
dialog: overthrow the government.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No one would ever suspect, right?
text: Aiken doesn't know what to make of Anna.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: May I take a look upstairs?
dialog: Anna knows why Aiken is here. Without missing a beat --
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: My brother's room is the third on
dialog: the left.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR -- A SHORT WHILE LATER
text: Aiken ascends the narrow STAIRCASE up to the SECOND FLOOR,
text: then crosses down a short HALLWAY. He enters a small BEDROOM
text: with two single beds, a desk and dresser inside.
text: Aiken begins to carefully search the bedroom -- underneath
text: the beds, the desk, then inside the DRESSER. He finds
text: undergarments, rolled socks...and, finally, a slip of PAPER.
text: Just as he pockets the paper, Aiken is startled from behind.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Find what you were looking for?
text: Aiken quickly recovers. Rises.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Louis Wiechmann shared this room,
dialog: correct?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That's correct.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Have you seen him recently?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, I haven't. Did you see much
dialog: action?
text: Anna is staring at Aiken's UNIFORM.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: A bit.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Kill any on our side?
text: A beat.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Miss Surratt, do you have records
dialog: indicating who stayed here? A
dialog: registry? A book of accounts?
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: Do you want me to help your mother
dialog: or not?

scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. VESTIBULE -- SHORT TIME LATER

dialog: Anything else you're hiding?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Such as?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Your brother to start.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: If you know where he is, I need to
dialog: know. Is that clear?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Do you have siblings, Mr. Aiken?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I thought not.
text: Suddenly, there is a tremendous CRASH --
text: Glass sprays across the floor
text: Aiken dives on top of Anna, placing them nose-to-nose.
text: A large ROCK rests beside them, inscribed in blood-red:
speaker_heading: DIE REBEL DIE
text: Aiken pulls himself off Anna, races OUTSIDE revolver drawn...
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Aiken turns to the Guard outside the door, still standing in

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Who did that?
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Did what, sir?
dialog: You're telling me you didn't just
dialog: see someone throw that rock

speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Guess I missed it, sir.

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Pack up. I'm getting you out of

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm not going anywhere.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: It's not safe for you to be here all
dialog: alone.
text: Anna calmly picks up the rock, and walks it across the room.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I've managed thus far.
text: She places the rock on a shelf, steps back revealing a small
text: pile of similar rocks.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Let's go. I will arrange for other
dialog: accommodations.
dialog: ANNA ; ;
dialog: A cell at Arsenal Penitentiary? No,

text: Aiken, startled AWAKE from a deep sleep, tries to make out

speaker_heading: STAIRWELL,
text: Tiptoeing downstairs to the --
speaker_heading: GROUND FLOOR,

text: slightly ajar. Aiken creeps forward, trying to peek inside.

text: Anna is serving them coffee.
text: Aiken inches closer to get a better look. The FLOORBOARD

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: HOLT.
dialog: ...the People call as their first
dialog: witness -- Lieutenant Louis Wiechmann.
text: LOUIS WIECHMANN, 22, marches in, PATRIOTISM personified --

text: Aiken leans over to Mary.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Why would the prosecution be calling

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Take this Bible in your right hand.

speaker_heading: HOLT (0.S.)
dialog: Lieutenant Wiechmann, are you
dialog: acquainted with the defendant, Mary
dialog: Surratt?
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: Yes. Yes, I am. I attended divinity
text: college with her son, John.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Until recently you resided at the
text: boardinghouse owned by Mrs. Surratt.
dialog: Isn't that correct?
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: That is correct, sir.
text: Holt gestures to the prisoners' dock
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Were any of those prisoners ever
dialog: present in her home?
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: Yes, sir. Those five to the right.
text: Pointing at the five furthest to the right -- HEROLD, ARNOLD,
text: O'LAUGHLIN, ATZERODT and PAYNE.
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN (CONT'D)
dialog: They were 'present' many times.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: At whose invitation?
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: Her son's.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Objection?
text: Aiken rises, but tentatively.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Uh, yes, there's no way of knowing...
dialog: I mean no foundation John Surratt
dialog: even knew these men -- let alone
dialog: invited them. And since Mr. Surratt's
dialog: whereabouts are_unknown at this time,
dialog: the question calls for speculation.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Mr. Surratt's absence from this

text: Aiken sits down.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Was John Wilkes Booth a frequent
dialog: guest of John Surratt's?
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: Indeed. But all the Surratts adored
dialog: him. John. His sister, Anna. And
dialog: their mother, too.
text: Wiechmann glances at Mary.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Were there ever meetings at the
dialog: boardinghouse involving Mr. Booth?
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: Many. Sometimes lasting two, three
text: hours. And always in secret, behind
text: closed doors.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Did you ever see Mary Surratt object
dialog: to these meetings?
speaker_heading: . WIECHMANN
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Or to the presence of those men?
text: Pointing at the prisoners.
text: Wiechmann and Mary's eyes meet, then Wiechmann looks away.
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: No, I did not. She appeared to
dialog: welcome them.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you
dialog: very much. That'll be all for now.
text: Wiechmann rises and begins to leave. Aiken is fumbling
text: through his notes. He seems lost.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (0.S.)
dialog: How long did you say these â€˜secret
dialog: meetings' lasted?
text: Wiechmann stops in his tracks. Returns to the witness box.
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: At least, two...three hours.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Yes, that's right.
text: Finally, Aiken looks up from his notes.
speaker_heading: AIKEN. (CONT'D)
dialog: So, if you were timing them,
dialog: Lieutenant...then, I suppose, these
dialog: "secret meetings' weren't actually a
dialog: secret kept from you.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: I knew about them, sir. But, I had
dialog: no knowledge of what they were about.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: That's because you never attended
dialog: any yourself?
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: Exactly!
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: And why was that?
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: I thought them suspicious.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: "Suspicious'! So then, you did know
dialog: what they were about?
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: No, sir. I did not.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Then why were your suspicions aroused?
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
text: By the snatches of rebel conversation
dialog: I overheard in the hallways. And by
text: their frequent whisperings.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Well, in that case. Why didn't you
dialog: immediately report your 'suspicions'
dialog: to your superiors at the War
dialog: Department?
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: My suspicions weren't of a fixed and
dialog: settled nature.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: "Fixed and Settled.' Were you
dialog: instructed to use those words?
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: Absolutely not.
text: Aiken ponders a moment, then sits down.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: If there's nothing else, Colonel.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Uh, I do have something else, sir.
dialog: Tell me, Mr. Wiechmann. Tell us.
dialog: Have you ever been to Richmond?
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Objection.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I merely wish to know if the
dialog: Lieutenant has ever visited the
dialog: capital of Virginia - and Confederacy.
text: General Hunter nods for Wiechmann to answer.
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: I don't recall.
text: Aiken withdraws the slip of PAPER -- the one he pocketed the
text: night before at the boardinghouse.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Perhaps, this train receipt will
dialog: refresh your memory. It indicates
dialog: passage to Richmond, and has your
dialog: name on it.
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: Yes. That's right. I considered
dialog: continuing my divinity studies there
dialog: after the war. I plan on becoming a
dialog: minister.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: A noble calling, indeed. At what
dialog: institute in Richmond did you think
dialog: of enrolling?
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: The name?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Yes, Lieutenant. The NAME!
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: Well, ah...
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: There is no academy of the kind in
dialog: Richmond, is there, sir?
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Objection, your honor!
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Perhaps, you visited Richmond for
dialog: another purpose entirely?
speaker_heading: HOLT
text: The question is argumentative.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I'll withdraw the question.
dialog: Lieutenant, you worked for the General
dialog: in charge of rebel prisoners, did
dialog: you not?
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: Yeah, so?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: So perhaps, a distinguished clerk
dialog: like yourself knew information.
speaker_heading: WIECHMANN
dialog: What sort of 'information'?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Of the sort that might've been of
dialog: divine interest to many rebels within
dialog: the capital of the Confederacy.
dialog: | ; HOLT .
dialog: Objection, your honor! The witness
dialog: is not on trial here.
text: The prisoner, LEWIS PAYNE, yells out from the dock.
speaker_heading: LEWIS PAYNE
dialog: He ought to be!
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Objection allowed. The witness is
dialog: not on trial.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Sir, I am simply trying to establish
dialog: theâ€™ credibility... or rather, the
dialog: lack of credibility.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Colonel Aiken, you are incriminating
dialog: the witness.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: "incriminating the witness"! The
dialog: Lieutenant shared a room with John
dialog: Surratt. I think it reasonable to
dialog: conclude Mr. Wiechmann might know a
dialog: thing or two about this plot to
dialog: assassinate our President.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: what the Colonel
dialog: is entirely irrelevant!
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Counselor, unless you have something
dialog: more pertinent to ask, the witness
dialog: will stand down.
speaker_heading: ; AIKEN ;
dialog: No, sir. No. I have nothing more
dialog: "pertinent" to ask.

speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Fred's right.
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: My mistake then. I just thought the

text: Several laugh at Aiken.
speaker_heading: AIKEN

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I've got to prepare for trial.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: You've got time enough for a drink.

speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: So, Freddie. Tell us. How did you
dialog: know?
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: "Know"?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: That the Lieutenant was lying. That
dialog: there's no divinity schoo in â€œall of

speaker_heading: AIKEN

speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: You bluffed?

dialog: Not one court in the nation has

dialog: The Lord knows the way of the wicked,

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Is your world so black and white?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: When it comes to doing what's right.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So, what is it you wish to know?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Why Booth and his associates were
dialog: constantly in your home?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I ran a boardinghouse, Mr. Aiken.
dialog: Forgive me if I chose to fill it
dialog: with boarders.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I checked your registry. There's no
dialog: record Booth ever stayed with you.
dialog: Fact is, he checked into the National
dialog: whenever he came to town. So, why
dialog: was he a regular in your home?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I suppose my son invited him. They
dialog: were friends.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: A famous actor like Booth engaging
dialog: your son out of friendship. I find

dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Ny Johnnie is no less a gentleman

dialog: late husband contributing to the
dialog: Confederate cause; about your eldest
dialog: son, Isaac, fighting for the rebel
dialog: army down in Texas; and about your
dialog: 'Gentleman' Johnnie, too.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: He made quite a sum as a Confederate
text: courier carrying rebel secrets across
dialog: enemy lines. So, I know damn well
dialog: what your family's capable of, and I
dialog: know you're not telling me the truth.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Then you know what I do not.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You were despondent over losing the
dialog: war, and would've done anything to
dialog: save the Confederacy -- including
dialog: using your own son, John.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Honestly, Mr. Aiken.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: So, you arranged a meeting with Booth --
dialog: figuring he'd befriend your son
dialog: because of what John knew -- what
dialog: expert couriers know --
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And what might that be?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: The best escape routes out-of-town.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I take it there's more.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Your son was supposed to lead the
text: other assassins to freedom that night.
dialog: Except, your son was the only one
dialog: that got away.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Quite persuasive, Mr. Aiken. Except
dialog: my son was up in Canada at the time

speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)

text: Aiken LIES to her.
speaker_heading: AIKEN

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: MARY,
dialog: You're cruel, Colonel Aiken.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: If you want to help her, ma'am, you
dialog: better start telling me the truth.

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Try me.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: My son abhorred the North. We all

text: DOWNSTAIRS, Anna cooks a meal for many. UPSTAIRS, Mary enters
text: her son's bedroom to find John busy packing.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Wash up, Johnnie. Supper will be
text: ready shortly.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
dialog: I can't stay, mama. I have to leave
text: town straightaway.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What could be more pressing than
dialog: fried chicken?
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
dialog: Nothing that need worry you. Just
dialog: some cotton speculating, that's all.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don't sport with me, son! You're
dialog: not stepping outside this house.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
dialog: Don't speak to me like I'm a child.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You and Anna are all the family I've
dialog: got left. I'll be damned if I let
dialog: you run off and do something else
dialog: oolish.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: "Foolish!" What I'm fighting for is
dialog: far more important than any of us.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sweetheart, nine tenths of our army
dialog: is buried underground. You think
dialog: they'll wait until we grow another?
text: The war is all but over, love. There
dialog: is nothing more you can do.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The war is far from over, mother
dialog: There's still much we can do!
text: John turns to leave. Mary grabs hold.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: John, please.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Unhand me, mother.
text: But Mary won't let go. John pushes Mary as he tries to break
text: free. She stumbles, banging her face on the table -- cutting
text: her eyebrow. Blood begins to trickle down her face.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: BOOTH (0.S.)
dialog: (shouts from downstairs)
dialog: John, are you coming or not?
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
dialog: For God's sake, mother, if this cause
dialog: ain't worth dying for, what is?
text: He turns and exits. Off Mary's dismay we CUT BACK TO --
speaker_heading: AIKEN (0.S.)
dialog: And this happened when?
scene_heading: PRESENT TIME: INT. MARY'S CELL --
text: A SCAR, now healed, is above Mary's RIGHT EYE.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: April 3rd.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Eleven days prior to the
dialog: assassination?
text: Mary nods. Tears are streaking her face.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: So then you admit your son did
dialog: conspire to murder President Lincoln?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: May God help you.
text: Aiken turns for the door
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Honestly, I don't. Lord, I pray
dialog: not. I only know that I did not.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I swear.
text: Mary's hand is on the Bible. Off Aiken and Mary in silence.
scene_heading: EXT. ARSENAL PENITENTIARY -- MOMENTS LATER, DUSK
text: As Aiken exits the front gate.
text: He stops and turns back toward the prison -- with a look of
text: stunned disbelief.
text: And then continues on his way...
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE -- SHORT TIME LATER
text: Aiken purposefully ascends the front stoop. He salutes the
text: new SOLDIER posted out front, and enters without knocking.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDINGHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 50.
text: Aiken beelines for Anna, who is sweeping up shattered glass.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You knew about the train ticket,
dialog: didn't you?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And good evening to you, Colonel.
dialog: Did you see my mother?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: She's fine.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You told her not to worry about me?
text: Again, Aiken lies.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Yes, I told her. Why didn't you
dialog: just give me the ticket? Instead of
dialog: oping I'd find it.
text: Anna ascends a ladder to fix a broken window.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Because you never would've offered
dialog: it in Court.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Chain of Custody: the ability to
dialog: guarantee evidence from collection
dialog: to presentation in Court.
text: Off Aiken's surprised look, Anna explains --
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
text: Counselor, a boardinghouse with no
dialog: guests leaves one with plenty of
dialog: spare time.
text: Then nods to a stack of law journals nearby.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Then you're aware I can't possibly
dialog: defend your mother unless I know
dialog: what's coming next.
speaker_heading: / ANNA
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I believe you know what witnesses
dialog: the prosecution may call, and the
dialog: evidence they'll use against her.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Wonderful, Mr. Aiken. Now, you're
dialog: accusing me of "building the. nest".
dialog: At least you're introducing reasonable
dialog: doubt for my mother.
text: Smash! Anna whacks a broken pane from the window.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Do you need some help?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I can manage.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Please let me do it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thanks just the same. But my father
dialog: and brother's example taught me never
dialog: to depend on a man.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: How dong . did you know Lt. Wiechmann
dialog: was working for the Confederacy?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: A while. And he didn't work hard
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Lou was too much of a coward to devote
dialog: himself to the Cause. That's why
dialog: I'd never consider marrying him.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: He proposed to you?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Don't seem so surprised by the notion
dialog: Mr. Aiken. Fact is, I was in love
text: with a man -- not_a boy. Lt.
dialog: Wiechmann didn't like that.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You really think that's why he
dialog: testified against your mothe
dialog: . ANNA | |
dialog: For it is written, vengeance is mine.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Any other Louis Wiechmanns I need to
dialog: be prepared for?
text: Anna, atop the ladder, turns and catches Aiken's eye wandering
text: up the back of her skirt.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Are you more interested in me or
dialog: defending my mother, Colonel?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I'm interested in the truth. Starting
dialog: with: where's your brother?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don't have the slightest idea.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Then perhaps you'll level with me
dialog: about what I can expect next at trial.
text: Several beats ensue.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're going to have to learn to
dialog: "depend" on me, Miss Surratt.
text: Anna thinks on it.
text: Finally, she descends the ladder. She gestures Aiken into
text: the PARLOR -- the exact spot where Booth and the others met.
text: As Anna and Aiken begin to go over the case, we CUT TO --
speaker_heading: HOLT (0.S.)
dialog: ...Let us_ proceed with events
dialog: immediately following the
dialog: assassination of President Lincoln.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. ARSENAL PRISON - COURTROOM -- NEXT MORNING
text: MAJOR H.W. SMITH, precise in manner and response, fills the
text: WITNESS BOX. (The Major was seen earlier reporting to Stanton
dialog: immediately after the assassination.) The prosecutor, HOLT,
text: is beside him, as the case against Mary Surratt continues.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Major Smith, what were your duties
dialog: that night?
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: I was charged with finding John
dialog: Surratt.
scene_heading: INT. SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE - PARLOR -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: A DOZEN POLICEMEN ransack the house, fii pping over furniture,
text: paintings and rugs. A PATROLMAN approaches Major Smith.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN #1
text: No sign of the son.
text: PATROLMAN #2 comes down the stairs.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN #2
dialog: Major, take a look.
text: He hands the Major a stack of card-sized PICTURES.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: We found these upstairs in the
dialog: daughter's bedroom.
text: Pointing at Anna Surratt, still in her nightshirt. Louis
text: Wiechmann is nearby, looking fearful.
text: INSERT: Each IMAGE as the Major flips through them:
text: -- First, a half-dozen DAGUERREOTYPES of CONFEDERATE GENERALS,
text: including pictures of Generals Lee, Beauregard and Jackson.
text: -- Then, a PRINTED CARD featuring the seal of the state of
text: Virginia with Confederate flags.
text: -- And lastly, a color LITHOGRAPH of a nursery fable, titled:
dialog: "Morning, Noon & Night".
text: The Major examines the fable more closely. He flips it over
text: revealing a PHOTO on the reverse side of JOHN WILKES BOOTH.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Young lady, does this belong to you?
dialog: Mary shields her daughter
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: This young lady belongs to me!
scene_heading: PRESENT TIME: INT. COURTROOM --
text: Holt holds up the CARD baring the Virginia state seal.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Major. Please read aloud what's
dialog: inscribed here.
text: The Major positions his reading glasses.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Sic semper tyrannis.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Can you translate?
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Of course. "Thus always for tyrants."
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Are these words familiar to you?
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Indeed. Booth yelled them after he
dialog: butchered our President.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: And you found the same -- just an
text: hour later -- in her daughter's
text: bedroom next to a photo of the
dialog: assassin himself?
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Like a shrine, sir.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: That's preposterous. Sic semper
dialog: tyrannis is the state motto of
dialog: Virginia. This is hardly proof of a
dialog: shrine to Booth.
text: General Hunter interjects with contempt.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: No more proof is needed, Colonel.
text: Aiken is stunned silent.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Major Smith, please tell us what
dialog: happened next.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: As I was fixin' to take the Surratts
dialog: down to headquarters for questioning,
dialog: I heard a commotion outside...
text: ...The sound of several men SHOUTING.
scene_heading: INT. SURRATT BOARDINGHOUSE - FOYER -- NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: Major Smith draws his gun before opening the back door
text: Lewis Payne (Booth's TALL ASSOCIATE, who attacked the
text: Secretary of State) is standing in the doorway.
text: Payne is sweating profusely -- like the fugitive he is --
text: with PICKAXE in hand. He is surrounded by TWO SOLDIERS.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER #1
dialog: We found him sneaking around outside.
speaker_heading: PAYNE
dialog: I told these imbeciles a lady inside
dialog: asked me to dig a gutter for her.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: At this time of night?
speaker_heading: PAYNE
dialog: In the morning. I just wanted to
dialog: know what time I should start.
text: Major Smith turns to Anna, who is watching from the doorway.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Is this true?
text: Anna says nothing. Major Smith calls into the PARLOR.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Mrs. Surratt. Come here a moment.
text: Major Smith spots BLOODSTAINS on the back of Payne's sleeve.
text: He takes the pickaxe from his hand.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH (CONT'D
dialog: Did you hire this gentleman to do a
dialog: job for you?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Absolutely not. I've never seen him
dialog: before in all my life.
scene_heading: PRESENT TIME: INT. COURTROOM --
text: Holt stands beside Lewis Payne at the prisoners' dock
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Is this man, Lewis Payne, the one
dialog: she denied knowing?
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: HOLT
text: The same man, who has confessed to
dialog: boarding at the Surratt's several
dialog: times -- prior to daggerin' the
dialog: Secretary of State and his kin.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Thank you, Major. Nothing further
text: Holt sits down triumphantly. Aiken rises.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Are you aware Mr. Payne boarded at
text: the Surratt's under an alias, claiming
dialog: to be a Baptist minister from
dialog: Baltimore named Wood?
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: That's what she claimed.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
text: Supposing it was the truth. Supposing
dialog: Mrs. Surratt simply failed that night
dialog: to recognize Wood, the preacher, in
text: the guise of Payne, the ditch digger.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Not possible. He stood barely two
text: paces in front of her.
text: Aiken pulls a LETTER from his briefcase.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Your honor, I present the court with
dialog: a notarized letter from Dr. Sanford
dialog: Wilkerson, a well respected
text: optometrist in town.
text: Aiken presents the letter to General Hunter.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mary Surratt has been a patient under
dialog: his care for the past six years,
dialog: suffering from severe presbyopia --
dialog: more commonly known as farsightedness.
text: General Hunter examines the letter. But not before having
text: to put on a pair of READING GLASSES himself.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Major Smith, it was late at night.
dialog: The defendant was dressed for sleep.
dialog: Isn't it possible she merely had
dialog: trouble seeing him?
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Well, I uh..
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: A simple yes or no.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Yes, it's possible...I suppose.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: So, it's also possible you -- or
dialog: rather we -- might also be wrongfully
dialog: accusing her of disloyalty too?
text: Major Smith holds up the daguerreotypes.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: I_think these more than indicate her
dialog: allegiances, Colonel.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Have you not seen the like in stores
dialog: around town?
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Yes, of course, but...
speaker_heading: _ AIKEN
dialog: So, do you intend to arrest me too?
text: Aiken presents to the Court an identical set.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: What's next? Roun ing up everyone
dialog: whose name rhymes with General Lee?
text: Several laugh aloud, including Baker and Catherine.
speaker_heading: MAJOR SMITH
dialog: Course not.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Then I dare say, we ought to presume
dialog: the accused is innocent unless we
dialog: have proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: A thirst for vengeance, Major, is
dialog: not enough to avenge this crime.
text: Even Hamilton has to admire Aiken's commanding presence....
scene_heading: INT. REVERDY JOHNSON'S HOME -- LATER THAT EVENING
text: Reverdy Johnson is eating his supper ALONE.
text: The doorbell rings. A STEWARD goes to answer the door.
text: Reverdy calls out.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: I'll take the transcript in here.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.
dialog: Sure you don't want me to read it
dialog: aloud?
text: Reverdy instantly recognizes the voice, looks up. It's
text: STANTON. He hands Reverdy the transcript.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: You're associate is putting up quite
dialog: a spirited defense. Reminds me of a
dialog: lawyer I faced 35 years ago.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: He learned to fight in your army.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Our young men certainly have been
dialog: through four years of hell.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: And we older ones better ensure it
dialog: was worth the fight.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Reverdy, you've done as much for our
dialog: nation as anyone I know.
scene_heading: | REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: Feeling's mutual, Ed.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Don't you think it's time us war
dialog: horses called a truce?
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: Not if you insist on staging this
dialog: abomination.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: What you consider an 'abomination'
dialog: will do more to keep the peace than
dialog: any paper treaty could.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: How'd you convince yourself of that?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Because it will deter the South from
dialog: conspiring again. And discourage
text: the North from seeking revenge.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: What about the rule of law?
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: For God's sake, we've never known an
dialog: enemy like this. They enjoy our
dialog: freedom at the same time they plot
dialog: to destroy us. Your actions only
dialog: serve to aid them -- by eroding our
dialog: unity and diminishing our resolve.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: By abandoning our laws we become
dialog: just like them.
text: Stanton begins to leave.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: You may prefer eating alone, Senator
dialog: But do you really want the Colonel
dialog: doing so the rest of his life?
dialog: qa beat)
dialog: If_he continues this way this case
dialog: will destroy him. You know I'm right
dialog: about this.
dialog: Off Reverdy Johnson taking this in...
speaker_heading: BAKER (0.S.)
dialog: So, this one time we were surrounded
text: by a rebel column.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. PRIVATE RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM -- SAME
text: Aiken is seated at an elegant DINING TABLE surrounded by
text: friends -- notably Baker and Hamilton. Catherine is across
text: from Aiken. Baker is mid-story.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Their General yells out, "I demand
dialog: you surrender immediately !" Well,
dialog: Freddie shouts back, "my compliments,
dialog: General. But we don't Surrender!"
text: All eyes are once again on Aiken.
speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: "Hope you said your prayers," the
dialog: General replies. "Cause they're 400
dialog: of us. And only 100 of you!"
text: Aiken pretends not to revel in the attention.
speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: "Heck, we've got less than that,"
text: Freddie hollers back
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: "But we don't surrender. So, shut
dialog: up and come get some." And with
text: that, Freddie pulls down his pants
text: and bares his ass.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST
dialog: No, he didn't.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: As the moon is my witness.
text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST #2
dialog: So, did they come?
text: Hamilton jealously glares at his date.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Six times. And each time the General
dialog: shouts out, "I won't ask you again.
dialog: Now, surrender at once."
dialog: (a beat
text: "Pray don't," Freddie shouts back.
dialog: "For we never surrender!" And then
text: he blows a tremendous fart in their
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST #3
dialog: He didn't!
dialog: ; BAKER ;
dialog: His seventh was so deadly it sent
dialog: them runnin' for their lives!
text: The TABLE erupts in laughter.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Doesn't seem like the Colonel ever
dialog: intends to surrender.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Only for the right woman.
text: Baker smiles reassuringly at Catherine.
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: Appears the Colonel has surrendered
dialog: to one -- she's fair, fit and 45.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I don't see why the Lieutenant insists
dialog: on bringing his mother into this.
text: More laughter. Hamilton seethes. Baker attempts to pacify.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Freddie, why don't you tell _us what
dialog: your conspirator is really like.
dialog: I'm sure we'd all like to know.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST #1
dialog: fcontemptuously)
dialog: I understand she's a Catholic.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST #2
dialog: Is it true she wears black from head-
text: to-toe as if she's in mourning?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Perhaps, by papal decree.
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: How did you do it, Fred?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: How did I do what?
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: Destroy that Major on cross like
dialog: that? The doctor's letter, the
dialog: postcards... You didn't bluff your
dialog: way through this one.
text: As Baker raises his artificial leg --
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: My leg's falling asleep. Let's go
dialog: dance.
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: You knew what was coming, didn't
dialog: you, Fred? Those meetings with the
text: Surratt girl seem to be paying off.
text: An awkward silence. Baker glances at Catherine.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Are you through, Bill?
dialog: (Hamilton says nothing)
dialog: Good. Now, let's dance.
text: Baker rises. The others follow suit. We HOLD ON Aiken and
text: Catherine -- still seated...
text: ...Gradually, PIANO MUSIC begins to fill the room.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. SALON -- LATER
text: As Baker is now at a piano, playing/singing, "The Children

speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Upon the Field of Gettysburg

speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: If I had known it was a wake, I'd
dialog: have dressed more appropriately.
text: Aiken turns to take in Catherine's floral dress.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You're the vision of perfection,
dialog: Catherine.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: You lie, pass gas and never surrender
dialog: Quite a catch.
dialog: a_beat)
dialog: Why defend her, Freddie?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Not you too, Catherine.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Is it because of Senator Johnson? I
dialog: know your father and he were very
dialog: close. But you don't owe it to either
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Does it have to do with Anna Surratt?
text: Aiken is taken aback.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Bill is an ass.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I understand she's very beautiful.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Catherine, please.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I accepted not hearing from you for
dialog: 18 months. The front must've been
dialog: horrible. But I will not accept
dialog: our silence on why you're defending
dialog: er.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (off her skepticism)
dialog: Honestly, Catherine. I don't.
text: Catherine can see Aiken means it. A beat.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Just one more thing.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You're the one who doesn't
dialog: "surrender". What? What do you
dialog: need to know?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Does the Colonel still remember how
dialog: to dance?
text: They exchange looks.
text: He holds out his hand. She takes it. Baker starts to pray
text: a slow waltz on the piano. With each turn across the floor,
text: the distance between Aiken and Catherine becomes less.
text: Aiken inhales Catherine's scent as she grasps his shoulder.
text: His eyes begin to fall to half-staff. His head rests against
text: hers. It looks as if Aiken is finally going to surrender.
text: Suddenly, he pulls away.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: There's something I need to ask you.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Of course, Freddie. You can ask me
dialog: anything?
text: Off Catherine waiting expectantly...
speaker_heading: AIKEN (0.S.)
dialog: I want you to wear this in court
dialog: today.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. MARY'S CELL -- NEXT MORNING
text: As Aiken presents Mary with Catherine's floral DRESS. Mary
dialog: doesn't take it.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I want the truth from you this time.
text: Aiken knows exactly what she's after.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Anna never went missing.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: She's been helping you all along?
text: Aiken nods.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: How could you lie to me about such a
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I needed to know the truth about
dialog: your son.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Nothing they do to me could compare
dialog: to the torture of not knowing my
dialog: daughter was ok.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Aiken pulls out NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS from his briefcase.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Please leave.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D.

dialog: (re. other clippings)
dialog: The others are less kin
text: Aiken holds out the dress. Mary refuses it.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It matters none to me what they think.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: It matters to me. This country has
dialog: never executed a woman. We need
dialog: those Generals to begin seeing their
dialog: own wives in you.
text: Mary grimaces momentarily, but conceals it from Aiken.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You speak of womanhood with such
dialog: reverence, Mr. Aiken. Yet, we aren't
dialog: trusted enough to vote, while a former
dialog: slave now can as long as he has $250.
dialog: (heavy Southern drawl)
dialog: Yes, I'm certain y'all would prefer
dialog: I acted like a good Southern lady.
dialog: Met my fate in that pretty dress
dialog: with a painted face. But, I'd prefer
dialog: to act naturally . And take the
dialog: consequences like a man.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Please. Ma'am. Wear the dress,
dialog: smile at those Generals and pray
dialog: they show you some mercy.
text: Mary holds a beat. She starts undressing in front of Aiken.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MARY
text: Just obeying orders, Colonel.
dialog: 64.
text: She drops her black dress to the floor. Starts unlacing her
text: corset. She is now standing in a calf-length chemise. She
text: slips off her pantalettes, and tosses it into the bucket.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come now, Freddie, don't be shy.
dialog: Surely, you've undressed a woman.
speaker_heading: ; AIKEN
dialog: You're insane.

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Fyou can arrange a meeting for me

speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: So I heard. Just a touch of the
dialog: woman's curse, thank goodness. She'll
dialog: be well enough to continue with her
dialog: trial within a few days. In the
dialog: meantime, we'll pursue our case
text: against the other Conspirators.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: My client requires a proper meal and
dialog: some fresh air. Otherwise, I can
dialog: not assure you she'll be fit for

dialog: Secretary -- immediately.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Unfortunately, he's quite busy right

speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: How dare you accuse US of savagery?

speaker_heading: HOLT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HOLT

speaker_heading: AIKEN

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: "US!" Whose side are you on?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I'm trying to save your life.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: By suggesting I trade my son's life

speaker_heading: AIKEN

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Anna chose to flee? Why would she

speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: Perhaps she's as guilty as her
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Do you believe that?
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: It matters none. Fact is with two
dialog: children abandoning Mrs. Surratt,
dialog: it'll only be seen one way -- their
dialog: mother must be guilty.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I think Mary may be innocent.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: Is that so? Well, "Mary" and "Anna"
dialog: they're my concern now. Your wish

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: So, you don't think I'm up to the
dialog: task of defending her?
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: Quite the contrary. I just think
dialog: it's best for all concerned that I
dialog: take over from here.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: But_your presence in that courtroom

dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: According to her daughter, she was
text: merely returning a favor to Booth.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: Dr. Mudd did Booth a favor by fixin'
text: his broken leg. Now, he's facing
dialog: life in prison. Edward Spangler
text: held Booth's horse outside Ford's
dialog: Theater and is looking at hard labor
dialog: So, don't do your client any "favors"

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: What do you suggest I do?
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: If it's John Surratt they want, then

speaker_heading: AIKEN

speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Objection?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Yes. There's no proof the defendant

speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: She damn well handed it to him.

speaker_heading: LLOYD

speaker_heading: HOLT

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Army rifles, sir. Hidden in the

speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: By whom?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: By her son, John. Six weeks earlier
text: Lloyd glares over at Mary.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: And were these weapons called for as
dialog: per the defendant's instructions?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yes, sir. Around midnight, sir, the

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Mr. Lloyd, you just testified Lt.
dialog: Wiechmann accompanied the defendant
dialog: that afternoon?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: So then I can correctly assume he'd
dialog: also testify to having heard Mrs.
dialog: Surratt's instructions to you?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: "No"? But they were seated side by
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: She took me out by the wood pile and
dialog: told me out of earshot.
speaker_heading: _ AIKEN ;
dialog: You're saying no one else heard this

speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's just the way it happened.
dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Of course it is.
text: Aiken and Holt exchange glances.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: When did you first learn the President
dialog: had been assassinated, Mr. Lloyd?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: No one will ever forget the moment
dialog: they heard. I was told early the
text: next morning by a Captain Cottingham,
text: who was searching for the assassins.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: No doubt, you were most upset!
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Indeed. I got myself right smart in
dialog: liquor the remainder of the day.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: In fact, you're right smart most
dialog: days. Aren't you, mate?
speaker_heading: ; LLOYD
dialog: I enjoy a round or two.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You shared a few with the defendant's
dialog: late husband, isn't that right?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Every now and again.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You were fond of him, weren't you?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: He was always good for a laugh.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: And for overlooking a debt.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: We had an understanding.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Which you and the defendant don't.
dialog: In fact, the day she and Mr. Wiechmann
dialog: visited the tavern, Mrs. Surratt
dialog: inquired about a significant sum you
dialog: owed her late husband. Isn't that
dialog: correct?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yeah, so?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: So, you have a financial stake in
dialog: the outcome of this trial.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: If you're suggesting I aim to profit
dialog: from our President's death, I've got
dialog: a good mind to put you in the ground.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Your words, Mr. Lloyd, not mine.
text: Lloyd stands up as if he's going to attack Aiken.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Objection! This courageous witness
dialog: is a former policeman. He deserves
dialog: our gratitude, not unfounded
dialog: accusations.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Sustained. Mr. Aiken, show the
dialog: witness some respect.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Yes, General. Thank you, Mr. Lloyd.

dialog: (a beat)
dialog: May I continue, your honor?
text: General Hunter nods.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Please be seated, Mr. Lloyd.
text: Lloyd does as told. Reverdy enters the back of the courtroom.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Mr. Lloyd, when this Captain
dialog: Cottingham visited you after the
dialog: assasSination, did he ask anything
dialog: in reference to the assassins?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: He asked if any parties had passed
dialog: through. Naturally, I told them
dialog: about the two I knew.
text: Aiken withdraws a document from his files.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: According to this witness report,
dialog: you didn't actually inform him until
dialog: wo days later.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I was frightened is all.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Perhaps, you feared you might be
dialog: considered an accessory.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I told him it was through the Surratts
dialog: that I'd gotten myself in such a
dialog: difficulty.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: John Surratt to be more precise.
dialog: After all, he's the one who concealed
dialog: those "shooting irons" inside your
dialog: tavern months earlier. Not you.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Perhaps, he threatened to foreclose
dialog: on your tavern if you refused.
text: Lloyd looks confused. Mary leans forward in her chair
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Were those John Surratt's
dialog: "instructions" to you?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: (getting Aiken's ist)
dialog: Yes, exactly. He said he'd take it
dialog: away from me if I didn't do what he
dialog: said.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Objection. There's no evidence John
dialog: Surratt did anything of the sort.
dialog: And since Mr. Surratt's whereabouts
dialog: are unknown at this time --
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: -- As the General said, Mr. Surratt's
dialog: absence from this proceeding is Mr.
dialog: Surratt's problem.
text: By quoting Hunter's own words, he's forced his hand --
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Objection overruled.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: So, if John Surratt could implicate
dialog: a dear friend of his father's, like
dialog: yourself, who's to say he didn't do
text: the same to his own mother as well.
text: Mary lunges at the rail.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Stop this. Stop this right now.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Objection.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Or that the only crime Mary Surratt
dialog: may be guilty of is having given
dialog: birth to her son, John.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: How dare you! You have no right.
text: General Hunter bangs his gavel repeatedly.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Objection, your honor. This is an
dialog: outrage.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Objection sustained. Mr. Aiken, I'm
dialog: warning you.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: But sir --
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: That will be all, counselor

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: So, what did they promise you?
speaker_heading: an HOLT
dialog: Objection, your honor!
scene_heading: GENERAL HUNTER AIKEN
dialog: Counselor, control Bet a case of whiskey is

speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Control yourself. Or I will hold
dialog: you in contempt.

speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll reconvene promptly at 09:00.
dialog: (to Aiken)
dialog: And when we do, young man, you'd
dialog: better comport yourself in a more
dialog: appropriate manner. Or else you'll

dialog: What are you talking about?
text: As Catherine waits patiently, she spots a BULLETIN BOARD
text: posted nearby.
speaker_heading: DEAR MEMBERS:
dialog: .Reverend Peale has agreed to.
dialog: .Construction will begin on.
text: Finally SETTLING on:
scene_heading: .The membership of MR. FREDERICK AIKEN
dialog: has been rescinded effective immediately
dialog: as a result of conduct unbecoming
dialog: The Century Club.
dialog: E.M, Stanton
dialog: Chairman, Board of Governors
text: Suddenly, the sound of LAUGHTER -- Hamilton, with beauty in
text: tow, and Baker arriving. Aiken turns to Baker.
speaker_heading: AIKEN. (CONT'D)
dialog: Nick, would you please take Catherine
dialog: inside for me.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Is everything alright?
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Everything's fine. I'll join you as
dialog: soon as I can. Go ahead, darling.
dialog: Enjoy the evening. Gentleman.
text: Aiken turns and heads for the door. Baker extends his arm.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Even on one I can outdance him.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: And one less foot for me to step on.
dialog: Another night, Nick.
text: Catherine kisses Baker on the cheek, and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Shall I call you a carriage, Miss
dialog: Morgan?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Thank you, Otis.
text: Hamilton calls out.
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: Sure you don't want to join us
dialog: Catherine?
text: She turns and glares at Hamilton. And heads out the door
text: without answering.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTURY CLUB -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Catherine exits. Otis motions for a carriage to pull forward.
text: Aiken suddenly appears.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I've got it, Otis.
text: Aiken helps Catherine into the CARRIAGE.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I saw the announcement.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I'll take care of it in the morning.
dialog: I'm sorry about this evening.
text: Tears begin to fill her eyes.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'm sorry too.
text: She slips off her engagement ring and returns it to Aiken.
text: The Carriage rides off. Aiken is now the outsider, and ALONE.
text: . A flash of LIGHTNING.
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: EXT. WASHINGTON CITY - STREET -- LATER
text: As BOLTS now light up the sky, replacing the fireworks.
text: They illuminate Aiken, who waiks alone in a torrential RAIN.
text: A THUNDERCLAP echoes overhead. A UNION BAND marches past
text: joyfully playing "Yankee Doodle" in the downpour.
text: Aiken is forlorn and soaking wet. He spots a PUB ahead --
text: THE BLUE GOOSE & OYSTER BAR -- and quickly ducks inside.
scene_heading: INT. BLUE GOOSE SALOON & OYSTER BAR -- CONTINUOUS
text: Aiken enters the pub, which is filled with a much ROUGHER
text: CROWD than the upper crust at the Century Club gala.
text: All eyes seem to follow him as he removes his drenched Union
text: coat, and settles on a stool at the end of the bar.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Whiskey.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Got none.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: How 'bout that bottle over there?
text: Aiken points to a WHISKEY BOTTLE, three-quarters full.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I don't want no trouble, Colonel.
text: He gestures to the PATRONS, all fixed on Aiken. A BLOCK-
text: HEAD leans in from Aiken's right, glaring at Aiken's uniform.
speaker_heading: BLOCK-HEAD
dialog: (southern accent)
dialog: Yanks ain't welcome here.
text: Several MORE TOUGHS now circle behind. There's no mistaking
dialog: now this is a Rebel bar.
text: Nervously, Aiken rises to leave. A BARREL-CHEST blocks him.
speaker_heading: BARREL - CHEST
dialog: You're the one defending that Surratt
dialog: women, aren't you?
text: Aiken nods as he prepares for the worst.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Why didn't you say so?
text: Suddenly, the entire pub descends upon Aiken. But instead
text: of attacking him, they're hailing Aiken like a hero.
text: HOLD ON: Aiken's expression registering his DISMAY.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: INT. AIKEN'S RESIDENCE -- A SHORT TIME LATER
text: Aiken stumbles home dripping wet and drunk.
text: He crosses inside his modest flat -- legal briefs, army
text: mementoes and dirty clothes are strewn about.
text: Framed DAGUERREOTYPES fill his mantel, including one of a
text: young woman (Aiken's MOTHER). A closer look reveals she's
text: inside a coffin, her death portrait. Another image is of a
text: young Aiken with his very formal-looking FATHER. A portrait
text: of PRESIDENT LINCOLN is the last photo shown.
text: Aiken's windows are also broken like Anna's -- a ROCK pile
text: is on the sill. One is inscribed: DIE REBEL DIE.
text: Aiken begins removing his soggy clothes to prepare for sleep --
text: suddenly, a HAND grabs his bare shoulder from behind.
text: Aiken whirls, takes the attacker's feet out from under him,
text: knocks him to the ground, and pins him...pins HER!
speaker_heading: FAMILIAR VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Frederick, stop. It's me.
text: As we reveal ANNA SURRATT, with Aiken straddling her, one
text: hand to her throat, another raised to strike.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: What the hell.
text: Aiken, now suddenly sober, relaxes his grip.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: She's very beautiful.
dialog: (Off Aiken's confusion)
dialog: I saw you go in your club tonight.
text: Aiken rolls off of Anna.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Anna. They think you're as guilty
dialog: as your brother. Where have you
dialog: been?
text: A long beat. Then softly --
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You still want to know where he is?
text: Another beat.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You don't have to do this. No one
dialog: should have to choose between their
dialog: mother and their brother
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I found out how...
text: Aiken cuts her off.
dialog: 84.
dialog: Please. I never should've put you
dialog: in this position. I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Can you save my mother without him?
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: Can you, Fred?
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Probably not.
text: Anna's eyes fill with tears. Aiken desperately wants to
text: comfort her. She desperately wants to be comforted. Instead,
text: she hands him a NOTE and flees. Off Aiken's turmoil...
text: ...A splash of WATER.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. CATHEDRAL -- EARLY MORNING MASS
text: As we reveal a BABY being BAPTIZED. Proud PARENTS and
text: GRANDPARENTS surround a PRIEST performing the ritual bath.
text: Aiken watches the tender scene from a rear pew.
text: The Priest, his identity still obscured, passes the Infant
text: off to an ASSOCIATE, then exits through a side door
text: Aiken follows behind.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (0.S.)
dialog: I'm told you know the whereabouts of
dialog: John Surratt.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. CHAPEL ANNEX -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The Priest's identity is now revealed -- FATHER JACOB WALTER
text: (the Cleric twice shown visiting Mary in jaity) Aiken shows
text: him the note on Anna's stationary with Walter's name on it.
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTER
dialog: You've been misinformed.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I need to see him right away.
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTER
dialog: Not possible, Colonel. As I told
dialog: Miss Surratt, I can only pass along
dialog: a message. We believe it safer for
dialog: everyone concerned.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: 'we'?
text: Father Walter pinches his cleric's COLLAR.
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTER
dialog: A few of us have chosen to provide
dialog: him sanctuary.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You don't seem troubled by your
dialog: choice.
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTER
dialog: You prefer he, too, be crucified by
dialog: this mob?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: "Crucified'!
text: Aiken's loud exclamation brings one of Father Walter's
text: ASSOCIATES to the CHAPEL DOOR. Aiken lowers his voice.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: John Surratt is hardly the 'Prince
dialog: of Peace.' He's accused of murder
dialog: and treason. Concealing him is not
dialog: only immoral, Father, its illegal.
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTER
dialog: (clutching a Bible)
dialog: My laws are written here, counselor.
dialog: My allegiance to God.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Forgive me, Father, but that's a
dialog: bunch of cock-and-bull. The Bible
dialog: bears just as many interpretations
dialog: as does anything else. It does not
dialog: give you the authority to decide
dialog: right from wrong.
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTER
dialog: You prefer Stanton having the power
dialog: instead?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I will pass along a_message, Colonel.
dialog: But John Surratt, alone, Will choose
dialog: whether or not to turn himself in.
dialog: Off Father Walter...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER (0.S. -)
dialog: Colonel Aiken, do you wish to call a
dialog: witness in defense of the accused?
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. PRISON - COURTROOM -- A SHORT WHILE LATER
text: The courtroom is sweltering like an inferno. Many fan
text: themselves with little relief.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Yes, your honor. I do. Will Miss
dialog: Anna Surratt please step forward.
text: Anna Surratt enters the courtroom.
dialog: 86.
text: As Anna is seated inside the WITNESS BOX, she gets her first
text: glimpse of her mother, nearly moving both to tears.
text: Aiken, sensing Anna is coming apart, steps near. Just as
dialog: he's about to say something --
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: resolute)
dialog: I'm fine.
dialog: As we CUT TO --
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- SAME
text: A flock of GEESE fly over a secluded LOG CABIN, tucked inside
text: a dense WILDERNESS. A RIVER roars beside.
text: A MAN in a dark suit wades across the river towards a YOUNG
text: FISHERMAN casting for SALMON. A closer look reveals the
text: suited man is a GRAY-HAIRED CLERIC. He bears an ENVELOPE,
text: which he hands to the Young Fisherman.
text: A closer look reveals the Young Fisherman is JOHN SURRATT,
dialog: as we CUT BACK TO --
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM -- SAME
text: Aiken stands beside Anna at the witness box.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Miss Surratt, when is the last time
dialog: you saw your brother, John?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Monday, the 3rd of April.
text: Aiken turns to the Commission for emphasis.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Eleven days prior to the
dialog: assasSination. Did he say where he
dialog: was headed?
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Please answer for the record.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He did not. He only told me he had
dialog: to leave town.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Miss Surratt, was your brother
dialog: involved in a conspiracy to
dialog: assassinate President Lincoln and
dialog: other members of the Government?
text: Anna looks at her mother, then looks away.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I can't say.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You can't? Or you won't?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I don't know if he was involved. I
dialog: only know that my mother was not.
text: Aiken glances at Wiechmann, seated in the gallery.
text: Anna nods.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: According to Lt. Wiechmann, your
dialog: mother "welcomed" these prisoners
text: into her boardinghouse with open
dialog: arms.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It's not true. He's lying.
dialog: (turns to wiechmann)
dialog: How could you? She would sit up and
dialog: wait for you at night, the same as
dialog: for my own brother.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Objection.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Miss Surratt. You will address this
dialog: Commission, not the gallery. Is
dialog: that understood?
speaker_heading: ; AIKEN |
dialog: Did your mother object to these men
dialog: being at the boardinghouse?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: She said she did not_understand why
dialog: strange persons should call there.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Then why didn't she refuse them?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: She Supposed their object was to see
dialog: my brother.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: John Surratt?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: So_she_was merely treating them
dialog: politely as any lady would?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: What about John Wilkes Booth? Did
dialog: she object to him as well?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Mr. Booth was not a stranger.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: In fact, he was friends with your
dialog: brother, John. Was he not?
text: Mary calls out to Aiken.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That is enough.
text: Anna glances at her mother.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Please answer the question, Miss
dialog: Surratt.
text: Anna proceeds, tentatively.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I never asked my brother what his
dialog: friendship was to Booth.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: But the fact remains, Mr. Booth
dialog: frequently called on your brother.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes.
text: Aiken presents a piece of evidence already presented in court --
dialog: the picture called "Morning, Noon and Night"
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Does this belong to you?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It was given to me by that man
dialog: Wiechmann.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: But it was you who put the photo of
dialog: John Wilkes Booth behind it?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes. I went to a daguerrean gallery
dialog: one day to get a picture taken. I
dialog: saw some photographs of Mr. Booth
dialog: there, and being acquainted with
dialog: him, I bought one, and took it home.
speaker_heading: IKEN
dialog: Your brother must've been pleased
dialog: you thought so highly of his friend.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: When my brother saw it, he told me
dialog: to tear it up and throw it in the
dialog: fire. And that if I did not, he
dialog: would take it from me.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Why? Why would your brother tell
dialog: you to do that?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You'll have to ask him.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Thank you, Miss Surratt. That will
dialog: be all. Your witness.
text: He turns to Holt.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: We have nothing, your honor. The
dialog: People view Miss Surratt's situation
dialog: with compassion. And can understand
dialog: how she'd be moved to conceal her
dialog: mother's guilt, even offering up her
text: own brother as a sacrificial lamb.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: But I'm telling the truth. My mother
dialog: is innocent.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: The truth is based in fact -- not
dialog: emotion.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: The truth, sir, is the truth. Not
dialog: what you choose to make of it.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: If there are no further questions
dialog: the witness may stand down.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You've got to believe me.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: Please call your next witness, Mr.
dialog: Aiken.
text: Anna remains in the witness box.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Miss Surratt, you are dismissed.
text: Anna tentatively begins to leave the witness box. She looks
text: to her mother. Mary looks back with disappointment.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Your honor, everyone else I wish to
dialog: call has either been silenced by
dialog: jail or the threat of one.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: HAMILTON
dialog: (asides to Baker)
text: Distoyalty surrounds itself with
dialog: disloyal friends.
text: Anna overhears Hamilton on her way to the door
speaker_heading: GENERAL HUNTER
dialog: I take it then the defense rests.
text: Aiken glances at Mary. She won't even look at him. Aiken
text: turns back towards General Hunter -- and nods. Anna holds a
text: moment at the door, devastated. As she exits, we CUT TO --
text: ...A SALMON flipping for its life inside a WICKER CREEL.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: EXT. FOREST -- DAY
text: As JOHN SURRATT sits mournfully beside his fishing basket
text: the opened ENVELOPE in hand, flapping in the wind.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (0.S.)
dialog: After the most thorough investigation
dialog: in our nation's history...
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. COURTROOM -- SAME
text: As Aiken begins his closing argument.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: ...the government's entire case
dialog: against Mary Surratt rests on three
dialog: acts alone:
text: The courtroom is rapt -- Baker, Catherine, even Hamilton.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: 1.) That she befriended John Wilkes
dialog: Booth and his fellow Conspirators;
dialog: 2.) That she carried a package from
dialog: Booth with "instructions" the day of
dialog: the assassination; and
dialog: 3.) That she failed to recognize
dialog: the prisoner, Lewis Payne, at the
dialog: time of her arrest.
text: Aiken rises from his chair.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: By themselves, these three acts
dialog: constitute no crime. You, or I,
dialog: might've done the same. But the
dialog: prosecution insists she did so with
dialog: evil intent -- largely on the
dialog: testimony of two witnesses: Louis
dialog: Wiechmann and John Lloyd.
text: Aiken glances at WIECHMANN and LLOYD in the Gallery.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Yet, all the facts suggest they should
dialog: be on trial. At best, their own
dialog: actions undermine their credibility.
dialog: At worst, they've done the unspeakable --
dialog: gained their freedom by falsely
dialog: accusing another of their crime.
dialog: (crossing the courtroom)
dialog: But let there be no doubt why Mary
dialog: Surratt is here today. It is because
dialog: of one person: her son, John.
dialog: (his back to Mary)
dialog: John Surratt invited Booth and his
text: associates into her home. She did
dialog: not. And he hid the rifles and
text: ammunition inside Lloyd's tavern.
dialog: Not her.
text: Aiken spots Reverdy, who nods his approval.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: If John Surratt was part of this
dialog: conspiracy, I hope he receives every
dialog: punishment known to man. But if
dialog: Mary Surratt can be convicted on
dialog: such insufficient evidence, then
dialog: none of us is safe.
text: Aiken pauses in front of Baker and Hamilton.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D
dialog: To preserve the Union, I'd have given
dialog: my life. Now, I find myself without
dialog: a side. Neither with the North or
dialog: against the South. My friends have
dialog: become foes -- my enemies, allies.
dialog: (looks at Hamilton)
dialog: But to abide by our Constitution is
dialog: not a question of latitude and
dialog: longitude -- North or South. It's
dialog: about what kind of nation are we.
dialog: One ruled by laws? Or by the fury
dialog: of our People?
text: Aiken examines a picture of Lincoln.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: What enemy should we fear most?
dialog: Lincoln was asked. Will it come
dialog: from Europe, Africa or Asia? No, he
dialog: replied. If we're to be destroyed,
dialog: it'll be from within. By failing to
dialog: rotect our Constitution and its
dialog: aws.
text: He puts the image of Lincoln back down.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D
dialog: So, if we are willing to die on the
dialog: battlefield defending our nation
dialog: against a hostile force... then we,
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: AIKEN foonT'd)
dialog: too, must safeguard our founding
dialog: principles with our lives.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Above all, we must never sacrifice
dialog: our sacred rights -- out of a desire
dialog: for revenge -- when so many have
dialog: given their lives to preserve them.
text: Aiken returns to his seat, and glances at Mary. A small nod
text: expresses her gratitude. Out of the corner of his eye, Aiken
text: spots Catherine, who is visibly moved.
speaker_heading: HOLT (0.S.)
dialog: Gentlemen. One bullet may have killed
dialog: our beloved President.
text: Holt begins his rebuttal.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: One bullet, but not one man!

scene_heading: INT. MARY'S CELL -- SAME
text: Aiken enters.
speaker_heading: AIKEN

speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry I went after your son like
dialog: that. I felt I had no choice.
text: After several moments.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: How 'bout we forget about the trial
dialog: for a while?
text: Aiken nods, pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Surely, there must be others you'd
dialog: prefer to play with.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: AIKEN

speaker_heading: AIKEN

text: inside. She takes the flask.
speaker_heading: MARY ;
dialog: I fancy both -- straight up and seven

text: And she starts shuffling -- like a pro.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hopefully, my luck's about to change.
dialog: What are we wagering?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Always the clothes on our backs.
text: A beat. Then Mary smiles. Aiken finds a spot across from
text: her, on the floor. As she starts to deal, we hear --
speaker_heading: MILITARY COMMISSION (0.S.)

scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. WAR DEPARTMENT - STANTON'S OFFICE -- LATER
text: SECRETARY STANTON is irate. HOLT attempts to appease him.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Only four of the nine agreed with

dialog: avored a more merciful sentence -
dialog: life in prison - on account of her
dialog: age and sex.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: How else will her son surrender if
dialog: he's not forced to offer his life
dialog: for hers?
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: I understand, sir. Unfortunately,

speaker_heading: STANTON

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: He hates me.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: My son. It wasn't Lincoln he
dialog: despised. It was me.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I don't follow.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I refused to have him turn out like
dialog: his father. I wouldn't let him out
dialog: of my sight. Kept him so close I
dialog: made him sit out the entire War.
dialog: Finally, he got the courage to break
dialog: free, and become what he always wanted -
dialog: what you are, Frederick.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Your own man.

speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You were in love with Booth. That's

speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
dialog: Booth is crazy. He's gonna get us
dialog: into trouble -- or worse.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Calm down, John. Just tell me what
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
dialog: He told me to pack a bag. He didn't
dialog: say where I'm going. He just insists
dialog: I leave town tonight.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Ok. Then go pack your bag.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
dialog: Ma won't let me go -- even if I
dialog: wanted.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What he's fighting for... what we're
dialog: fighting for is more important than
dialog: any of us.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
text: Richmond's fallen. The War is over
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: The War is far from over, John.
dialog: There's still much we can do!
dialog: (John doesn't budge)
dialog: Don't be like Pa. Have the courage
dialog: to see something through.
text: John angrily turns away, and storms up the stairs.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Impressive.
text: Anna is startled. Booth is standing in the kitchen doorway.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Mr. Booth.
speaker_heading: _ BOOTH
text: Anna. Looking as lovely as ever.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: "Lovely". Indeed, you are a fine
dialog: actor.
text: Anna removes her apron in an attempt to make herself
dialog: presentable.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: How long have you been there?
speaker_heading: BOOTH
dialog: Long enough to know the Cause would
dialog: be better off with more like you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Booth. That's a
dialog: compliment I will accept.
text: There is an undeniable chemistry here.
text: Off-screen, Mary and her son are in a heated conversation.
text: (NOTE: The rest of this scene is familiar from earlier in
dialog: the script -- only we saw it from Mary's POV, not Anna's.)
speaker_heading: MARY (0.S.)
dialog: There's nothing more you can do.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT (0.S.)
dialog: The war is far from over, Mother
dialog: And there's still much I can do!
speaker_heading: BOOTH
dialog: Does he not have an original thought?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Think what you will, Mr. Booth, but
dialog: he's still my brother.
speaker_heading: BOOTH
dialog: My apologies, Miss Surratt. I'll
dialog: see to it he makes you proud.
speaker_heading: MARY (0.S.)
dialog: John, please.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT (0.S.)
dialog: Unhand me, Mother.
text: Suddenly, there is a CRASH upstairs. Silence follows. Anna
text: moves towards the stairs, but Booth grabs her arm.
speaker_heading: BOOTH.
dialog: (shouts upstairs)
dialog: John, are you coming or not?
text: Moments later, John Surratt comes down the stairs, a packed
text: bag in hand. He blows past Anna, and says to Booth.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
dialog: Let's go.
text: Booth and Anna exchange a look. Booth follows John Surratt
text: out the front door.
text: Several moments later Mary comes down the stairs. She is
text: bleeding from a cut above her eye.
text: Off Mary exchanging a long look with Anna, we CUT BACK TO --
scene_heading: PRESENT TIME: INT. BOARDINGHOUSE -- AFTERNOON
text: Anna, tears now streaking her face, is holding a WANTED POSTER
text: featuring John Surratt.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: it should be my face on this -- not
dialog: is.
text: Aiken remains silent.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: I am such a coward. He's my younger
dialog: brother. I should've protected him.
dialog: But instead, I pushed him into it.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You didn't know exactly what you
text: were pushing him into.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I know now. And yet I still told
dialog: you where to find him, and damned
text: im on the stand.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You did so to save your mother.
speaker_heading: ANNA ;
dialog: They need to know what I did.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: To what end? Because it will help
dialog: your mother none.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: But it's the truth.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Does she know?
text: Anna nods.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Then no one else needs to.
text: And Aiken turns for the door, and exits, leaving Anna alone.
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDINGHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Aiken begins to descend the steps. He hesitates a moment
text: thinks on it, and then continues on his way.
scene_heading: INT. CELL
text: Mary, at her cell window, soaks in the late afternoon
text: sunlight, as we hear, off screen --
speaker_heading: PAPER BOY (0.S.)
text: DEATH BY HANGING! DEATH BY HANGING
scene_heading: PULL BACK: EXT. WASHINGTON STREET

text: the headlines aloud, almost gleefully.
speaker_heading: PAPER BOY
dialog: Mary Surratt To Meet Her Doom..

scene_heading: FOUR CONSPIRATORS TO BE EXECUTED
dialog: Herold, Atzerodt, Payne
dialog: &
speaker_heading: MARY SURRATT
dialog: Others Get Prison Terms
dialog: 101.
text: Aiken looks up from the paper and spots Catherine -- along
text: with his mates -- across the street.
text: Aiken takes off. Only Catherine sees him scurrying away.
text: While the others chatter about the impending executions,
text: Catherine remains apart, with a look of dismay, as we cut to --
text: FULL SCREEN: Of a ROCK, wrapped with the latest newspaper
text: surrounded by shattered GLASS...
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - FOYER
text: Revealing Anna, slumped, sobbing, with the rock beside her
text: It's clear she's now heard the news.
scene_heading: INT. U.S. CAPITOL - AIKEN'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Aiken, in disbelief. Reverdy Johnson is behind his desk
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Mudd, Arnold and O'Laughlin got life
dialog: in prison instead of death. And
dialog: Spangler only a half a dozen years.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: Stanton doesn't want their sons.
dialog: Any word from hers?
text: Aiken shakes his head.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
dialog: qhen there's nothing more you can
speaker_heading: oO.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: There has to be something.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: Fred, you ve done everything you
dialog: ossibly could. Better than I would
dialog: ave done. But your only allegiance
dialog: now must be to yourself.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: There are at least a dozen grounds
dialog: on which to appeal this verdict.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: And you know there's no appealing
dialog: it. That's why Stanton tried her in
text: a military court.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: What about petitioning the President
dialog: for a stay?
scene_heading: _. REVERDY JOHNSON ;
dialog: The President signed the execution
text: order. It's over.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Can you get me in to see him? I'll
dialog: plead her case directly...
text: Reverdy cuts him off.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: If John Surratt won't sacrifice
dialog: himself, son, why should you? She's
dialog: not your mother.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: And you're not my father.
speaker_heading: CHOIR BOY (0.S.)
dialog: Colonel Aiken?
text: A CHOIR BOY, 12, is standing in the doorway. Aiken nods.
speaker_heading: CHOIR BOY
dialog: This here's for you.
text: The Boy passes him a NOTE. Aiken quickly reads it, then
text: grabs his jacket and heads for the door
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: Stanton will destroy you if you
dialog: persist. Freddie, this is not a war
dialog: you can win.
text: But Aiken is gone, as we CUT TO --
text: ...The SOUND of screeching across a stone floor.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. ARSENAL PRISON - SECOND FLOOR -- DUSK
text: A GUARD pushes a CART down the second-story CATWALK, stopping
text: in front of DAVID HEROLD's CELL. He passes a TRAY inside.
text: HEROLD receives the BEER and SANDWICH, his FINAL MEAL.
text: LEWIS PAYNE chews on a FAT CIGAR.
text: GEORGE ATZERODT cradles a BOTTLE of BOURBON.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. MARY SURRATT'S CELL -- MAGIC HOUR
text: Aiken enters with Mary's TRAY. He raises the cover
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Boiled oysters!
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: And some laudanum to calm the nerves.
text: Aiken hands her a small bottle filled with liquid.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: My goodness, you remembered the
text: spanish olives.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: It wasn't I.
text: Aiken nods toward the door, as Anna suddenly appears. Anna
text: freezes in the doorway. Doesn't know what to do.
text: Mary opens her arms. Anna rushes into them. For the first
text: time in a long while Anna is allowed to be a young girl again.
text: Mary cradles Anna in her arms. She takes in every inch.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I think this is what I'm going to
dialog: miss most.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please, Mama. Don't...
text: Aiken moves toward the door to give them privacy.
speaker_heading: MARY ;
dialog: You've heard from my son, Frederick
dialog: haven't you?
text: Aiken stops in his tracks.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Fred.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don't be. He's safe this way. These
dialog: smell delicious, Anna. Let's just
dialog: enjoy your oysters, shall we? Come,
dialog: Frederick.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I'm going to appeal to Father Walter
dialog: one last time.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I forbid you.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: If I can produce your son, you just
dialog: might live.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: If you "produce" my son, they will
dialog: hang him alongside of me.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You don't know that. For God's sake,
dialog: Mary, make Father Walter tell us
text: where they're hiding him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'll do no such thing. Some day,
dialog: John will be found.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hopefully then, vengeance will no
dialog: longer rule the day.
text: Anna can remain silent no longer.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: This is my fault.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hold your tongue.
text: She glances at Aiken.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He knows, Ma. He knows I pushed
dialog: John into this.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You poor dear. You must put your
dialog: mind at ease.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I will never forgive myself.
speaker_heading: MARY,
dialog: You are not to blame, Anna.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Nor you Mary. It is your son who
dialog: should be held accountable. Forget
dialog: what he did to the country. Look at
dialog: what he's done to your family.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I assure you, Frederick, we will all
dialog: be summoned before the judgment bar
dialog: of God -- where every knee must bend
dialog: and every tongue confess.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please, Ma. Let me tell them.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Shhh, my sweet. I've lived a blessed
dialog: life. 'm at peace with this. One
dialog: day, when you have a child, you'll
dialog: understand why it must be this way.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: All I ask is that you be there for
dialog: your brother -- more than you've
dialog: ever been.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Promise me.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'll try, Mother.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Good. Now, let's eat.
text: Aiken turns for the door
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Frederick. It's over. You must
dialog: stop pursuing John. Is that clear?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: IKEN
dialog: I will stop pursuing John. You have
dialog: my word.
text: And Aiken departs.
text: The sound of HAMMERING fills Mary's cell. As Mary pulls
text: Anna closer to her, we CUT TO --
text: The PRISON COURTYARD below, where WORKMEN are beginning to
text: construct the GALLOWS. The SETTING SUN envelops the PRISON
text: in a fiery orange.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - SITTING ROOM -- SAME
text: Catherine is meeting with several SOCIETY WOMEN. We don't
dialog: know exactly what is being said except that she's arguing
text: with passion -- and seems to be convincing a few.
scene_heading: INT. WAR DEPT. - HOLT'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING
text: As Aiken pleads with Holt, far less successfully.
speaker_heading: HOLT
text: The death sentence is signed, Colonel.
dialog: There's nothing I can do.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I'm not asking to overturn the verdict --
dialog: merely for a stay. So, I can petition
dialog: for a new trial, in a civil court
text: before a jury of her peers.
speaker_heading: OLT
dialog: Then, you â€˜ll Have to speak directly
dialog: with the President. He's the only
dialog: one who can grant such a delay.
text: Aiken begins to leave. Holt calls out.
speaker_heading: HOLT (CONT'D)
dialog: I dare say, you have a better chance
dialog: overturning this building than getting
dialog: him to save your client. Lest, he
dialog: arouse suspicion his own hands have
text: Lincoln's blood on them.
text: Aiken seems about to disclose John Surratt's whereabouts.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: HOLT (CONT'D
dialog: Something you wish to tell me,
dialog: Colonel?
text: Aiken considers, then shakes, No.
speaker_heading: HOLT (CONT'D)
dialog: In that case, dear boy, there's
dialog: nothing more you can do.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN -- EARLY EVENING
text: Catherine is now surrounded by a larger crowd of SOCIETY
text: WOMEN -- all near her age. Seems she's won more converts to
text: her side, though her exact cause is not yet clear to us.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. WHITE HOUSE -- SAME
text: The lights are on UPSTAIRS in the President's private
text: residence, but he's nowhere to be found DOWNSTAIRS.
text: Aiken appeals to two graybeards -- CONGRESSMAN KING and
text: SENATOR LANE -- just inside the front FOYER.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: All I require is a few moments of
dialog: the President's time.
speaker_heading: CONGRESSMAN KING
dialog: I've already told you, Colonel, the
dialog: President won't interfere with the
dialog: Court's ruling. This is a military
dialog: matter, and must be taken up with
dialog: the War Department
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: And I just told you, they're insisting
dialog: the decision is up to the President.
speaker_heading: SENATOR LANE
dialog: We're sorry.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
text: Congressman King. Senator Lane. At
dialog: least, permit me to ask President
dialog: Johnson for a week's delay.
speaker_heading: SENATOR LANE
dialog: The judges have ruled, and there's
dialog: nothing the President can do.
text: Off Aiken appearing to have run out of options, we CUT TO --
text: ...The SOUND of shattered GLASS.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. MARY SURRATT'S CELL - SAME
text: As Mary smashes the empty laudanum bottle into pieces. She
text: checks Anna, who is in a laudanum-induced deep sleep, before
text: selecting the largest SLIVER. Mary begins to raise the knife-
text: like shard up towards her THROAT...
dialog: 107.
text: Slice...Slice...SLICE... STRANDS of HAIR falling gently into
text: her lap. Mary starts WEAVING the LOCKS together as the sound
text: of HAMMERING fills the room like a rhythmic DIRGE...
scene_heading: EXT. U.S. CAPITOL BUILDING -- EVENING
text: As the MOON rises high in the sky.
scene_heading: INT. AIKEN'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Aiken enters, crestfallen, seemingly nothing more he can do.
text: To his surprise, Reverdy Johnson q5 seated behind his desk --
text: surrounded by LEGAL TOMES.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: Pull up a chair, Freddie. We've got
text: a long night ahead.
text: Aiken does as told. The men start working away, their heads
text: buried in case law. After several beats --
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Know any jokes?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Matter of fact I do.
scene_heading: INT. U.S. ARSENAL PRISON - COURTYARD -- MIDNIGHT

speaker_heading: JULY 7, 1865
scene_heading: INT. U.S. CAPITOL - REVERDY JOHNSON'S OFFICE -- SAME
text: SUNLIGHT catches Aiken in the EYE. He looks at Reverdy, who
text: is writing away, then glances at the WALL CLOCK, which reads:
text: 6:05 A.M.
text: Suddenly, CATHERINE appears in the doorway accompanied by a
text: DOZEN WOMEN in their Sunday best.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Catherine? What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: We wish to help your client.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: How?
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: By petitioning the President on her
dialog: behalf.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: You're serious.
text: Catherine nods. So do the other women.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a_very kind gesture. Thank
dialog: you. But I've tried. It's impossible
dialog: to even get through the door.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Perhaps, the daughters of a senator,
dialog: congressman, two ambassadors and a
dialog: cabinet member may persuade him to
dialog: let us in.
text: Aiken looks at Reverdy for his response.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON
dialog: "Impossible" may have been a bit
dialog: strong, Fred. Ladies, good luck
text: Reverdy, Catherine exchange smiles. Aiken is clearly touched.
text: Reverdy hands Aiken a DOCUMENT he's been working on.
speaker_heading: REVERDY JOHNSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Frederick. Run.
text: Catherine gives Aiken a kiss, as he rushes out the door
scene_heading: INT. U.S. CAPITOL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Aiken sprints across STATUARY HALL past the BUSTS of our
text: Founding Fathers, then out the Capitol doors.
text: ...Pounding and POUNDING.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: EXT. TOWNHOUSE -- A SHORT WHILE LATER
text: Aiken beats on the FRONT DOOR of a three-story BROWNSTONE,
text: along a quiet, residential street.
text: No street TRAFFIC outside. No LIGHTS on inside. No ANSWER.
text: Aiken pounds again and again. Moments later, a fragile, OLD
text: MAN opens the door, still tying on his robe.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: What in God's name?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Justice Wylie
scene_heading: OLD MAN/JUSTICE WYLIE
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Frederick Aiken, your honor. TI have
dialog: an application here for a writ of
dialog: habeas corpus.
speaker_heading: JUSTICE WYLIE
dialog: Are you daft, young man? It's barely
dialog: light.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: It can't wait, sir. The Supreme
dialog: Court of the District of Columbia is
text: out last hope.
speaker_heading: JUSTICE WYLIE
dialog: What's this about?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Mary Surratt.
text: Wylie becomes agitated.
speaker_heading: JUSTICE WYLIE
dialog: I can't help you, son. I'm sorry.
dialog: Now, please go.
text: Aiken holds up the WRIT APPLICATION.
speaker_heading: _ AIKEN
dialog: Please, sir. Either you act_now -
dialog: or else an innocent woman will die.
text: Wylie begins to close his door... then pauses to reconsider
text: He checks the street both ways before waving Aiken inside.
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE -- SAME
text: Catherine leads her small army inside the White House, past
text: the gatekeepers -- SENATOR LANE and CONGRESSMAN KING.
scene_heading: INT. JUDGE'S STUDY -- SHORT WHILE LATER
text: MRS. WYLIE enters with tea and biscuits. Aiken anxiously
text: waits as Justice Wylie reviews his WRIT.
speaker_heading: JUSTICE WYLIE
dialog: During the War, Lincoln suspended a
dialog: number of our rights -- including
dialog: the writ of habeas corpus, which you
dialog: seek here today. If he hadn't, we
dialog: might've lost the Union. So, how
dialog: can you argue with his decision?
dialog: What good is our Constitution if
dialog: our nation is destroyed?
text: Aiken looks distraught.
speaker_heading: JUSTICE WYLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: But then again, what good is our
dialog: nation without our Constitution...
text: Off Aiken's expression changing to relief --
dialog: 110.
scene_heading: INT. WAR DEPARTMENT - HOLT'S OFFICE -- SHORT WHILE LATER
text: As Aiken slams the WRIT down on Holt's desk. Holt, caught
text: off-guard, shaving foam still on his face, examines the WRIT.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: You had no right, Colonel.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Wrong, "dear boy". It's our
dialog: Constitutional right. She should be
text: released no later than noon.
text: Aiken exits. Holt turns to an aide.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: Sergeant. Find Secretary Stanton --
dialog: immediately!
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE HOUSE -- SHORT TIME LATER
text: As Catherine and her group emerge from the White House,
text: Stanton rushes inside. Catherine looks on with concern.
scene_heading: INT. ARSENAL PRISON - MARY'S CELL -- SHORT WHILE LATER
text: Anna has a look of shock
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: So there'll be a civil trial next
dialog: time? No generals?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: No generals.
text: Anna can barely believe Aiken's news. Mary too.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Bless you, son.
text: Mary regards Aiken as if he were her own. He's clearly moved.
text: Anna and Mary embrace. Aiken glances out the window.
text: AIKEN'S POV: From the window down into the COURTYARD below --
text: FOUR CHAIRS are being set up atop the HANGING PLATFORM.
text: Aiken's face fills with panic.
text: As he turns back from the window, SOLDIERS suddenly appear
text: at Mary's door. Leading the way is the prison's COMMANDANT.
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Ma'am, it's time.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: We need to prepare her with the
dialog: others.
dialog: 141.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: The only preparing should be for her
dialog: release.
text: The Commandant glances toward Anna.
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: I advise sedating the young lady.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You'll do no such thing.
text: Aiken presents the Judicial Order.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I've got a writ that says Mary Surratt
dialog: is to be released into my custody.
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Colonel. The President just suspended
dialog: your writ.
text: He hands Aiken the Executive Order from the War Department.
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. She's to hang alongside
text: the others no later than noon. Now,
dialog: step aside. We've got less than an
dialog: our.
text: On the Commandant's signal, the Soldiers move Aiken aside.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Frederick. Do something.
text: Anna clutches her mother. Mary slips a HAIR BRACELET she's
text: woven from her own locks onto her daughter's wrist.
speaker_heading: MARY,
dialog: I'll always be with you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please. Tell them they can't.
text: Aiken scans the Executive Order. His expression indicates
text: there's nothing he can do. As the Soldiers begin to escort
text: Mary, she clasps her BIBLE and ROSARY beads.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No mother was ever more proud, Anna.
dialog: Frederick. Thank you.
text: Aiken steadies Anna. But it's as if he's steadying himself.
text: Suddenly, Anna pulls away from Aiken.
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: Let go of her.
text: And she pounces on the soldiers. They quickly restrain Anna,
text: as the Prison Doctor injects her with a sedative.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: MARY ANNA
dialog: Please, God. Don't No. Mama. No....
dialog: let them hurt her.
text: Anna screams as her mother is being led away. Mary, stricken
text: with concern, calls out.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I love you, darling.
text: Anna crumbles as Aiken catches her
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: I've got her, Mary. It's ok.
text: Mary, seeing that Aiken has Anna, relaxes slightly, then
text: calls out to Aiken.
speaker_heading: MARY ; /
dialog: Proverbs 29:16, Frederick. Promise
dialog: you won't forget.

dialog: I promise.
text: And Mary disappears from view. As Anna begins to fade from
text: exhaustion and the sedative, she mumbles aloud.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'll never forgive myself.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: It's ok, Anna. It's ok.
text: Anna gently lays Anna down. The Commandant retrieves Mary's
text: white HANDKERCHIEF from the cell floor, and hands it to Aiken.
speaker_heading: COMMANDANT
dialog: Proverbs 29:16?
text: Aiken repeats by rote, staring off, in shock
speaker_heading: AIKEN

scene_heading: INT. WAR DEPARTMENT - STANTON'S OFFICE -- SHORT WHILE LATER
text: Aiken rushes past Stanton's AIDE.
speaker_heading: STANTON'S AIDE
dialog: Sir, you can't enter without an
dialog: appointment...
text: Aiken ignores the Aide, and bursts inside STANTON'S OFFICE.
text: He finds the War Secretary seemingly OBLIVIOUS to events
text: beyond -- reading a paper, while devouring a hearty breakfast.
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: You're too late, counselor. You had
dialog: your chance.
text: Stanton's Aide rushes inside.
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: I'm so sorry, Mr. Secretary.
text: Stanton waves the Aide off.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: For God's sake, she's innocent.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: I didn't sentence her, the Court
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: At your request, no doubt.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Assuming I could, why would I ever
dialog: choose to do such a thing?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Revenge.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Goodness, no. I'd never go to such
text: lengths out of vengeance.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: But to assure the safety and security
dialog: of this nation, indeed, I'd do
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: But you want her son.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: At this point, I'll settle for either
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Like a human sacrifice?
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Just think of her as another casualty
dialog: of war.
text: He points to a stack of CASUALTY PHOTOS from the war.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: On which side?
speaker_heading: ; STANTON
dialog: Union over Disunion.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Not the Union I fought for. Nor the
dialog: one Lincoln gave his life to save.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: No Union is worth preserving unless
dialog: it guarantees justice for all.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Words for rallying the troops, Colonel --
dialog: Not for running a nation.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: If you permit this injustice, I
dialog: promise you'll regret the day.
speaker_heading: STANTON
dialog: Is that a threat, young man?
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: It's a prediction.
text: ...A Slip of PAPER with "MARY SURRATT" written across it.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. ARSENAL PRISON - COURTYARD -- NEAR NOON
text: Mary's NAME is put inside a BOTTLE. The bottle is then placed
text: inside a GUN CRATE baring a "WINCHESTER" label.
text: The CRATE is set next to THREE identical BOXES -- each with
text: a bottled name inside -- "ATZERODT," "HEROLD" and "PAYNE".
text: The FOUR COFFINS now wait to be filled alongside the GALLOWS.
text: Nearby, a SOLDIER passes the PRISON COMMANDANT a NOTE.
dialog: ; SOLDIER ;
dialog: Captain, the prisoner, Lewis Payne,

scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
text: Aiken tugging on a HORSE'S REINS.
speaker_heading: BEGIN MONTAGE:
dialog: (No dialogue, just music)
text: Aiken races across town in a horse-drawn BUGGY, desperate to
text: reach Mary before it's too late.
text: A GUARD unlocks a METAL DOOR as the PRISONERS -- Atzerodt
text: Herold, Payne and Mary Surratt -- are led from their CELLS.
text: Mary clenches ROSARY BEADS firmly in her RIGHT HAND.
dialog: 115.
text: The Prison Doctor tends to Anna inside Mary's cell. He places
text: her hand across her chest -- Mary's HAIR BRACELET now rests
text: on Anna's heart.
text: Aiken abandons his buggy in TRAFFIC, and begins weaving his
text: way through the crowd. He throws off his UNION JACKET as a
text: passing carriage rides over it, grinding it into the ground.
text: Inside the PRISON COURTYARD, HUNDREDS of SPECTATORS and PRESS
text: excitedly await the spectacle about to happen.
text: A Soldier opens a BLACK PARASOL over Mary's head to
text: chivalrously shield her from the broiling midday SUN. The
text: FOUR PRISONERS are now led across the COURTYARD, forced to
text: pass a GAUNTLET of onlookers on their way to the GALLOWS.
text: Aiken navigates a gauntlet of his own OUTSIDE the PRISON
text: WALLS as VENDORS gleefully hawk LEMONADE and CAKES.
text: Mary ascends the GALLOWS where the HANGMAN now awaits. Aiken
text: ushes past the MOBS, racing inside the PRISON WALLS. Father
text: alter, now by Mary's side, administers FINAL RITES.
text: The other THREE PRISONERS are readied, with WHITE HOODS
text: covering their heads to conceal their panicked faces. The
text: HANGMAN removes Mary's BONNET and VEIL, fastening her hands
text: behind her back, and her skirt about her knees.
text: Aiken rushes inside the COURTYARD, past BAKER and CATHERINE
text: desperate to see Mary before it's too late.
text: He spots Mary. She sees him too. A SMALL SMILE springs to
text: her lips. Aiken SMILES BACK, wiping tears from his eyes.
text: He nods one LAST TIME to her. And she to him.
text: The HANGMAN places the HOOD and NOOSE over Mary's head, as
text: Aiken looks away -- unable to watch any more.
text: Aiken feels a HAND on his shoulder. It belongs to REVERDY
text: JOHNSON, who buttresses Aiken for what's about to happen.
text: The PRISON COMMANDANT claps THREE TIMES --
text: Followed by FOUR SOLDIERS, who knock away the support beams
text: beneath the platform holding up the PRISONERS --
text: The HANGING PLATFORM swings down on its hinges as Mary and
text: the others jerk downward with a terrifying...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUMP !
text: Then, silence -- a long deafening SILENCE -- broken, finally,
text: by the sound of a FLASH BULB.
text: We HOLD ON an image of the scaffold, as Mary Surratt becomes

scene_heading: WASHINGTON, D.C. CRIMINAL COURT
scene_heading: AUGUST 10, 1867 - TWO YEARS LATER
text: The FOREMAN, 43, rises.
speaker_heading: FOREMAN (0.S.)
dialog: No, your honor. We have not.
text: The FOREMAN & JURY are distinct for being indistinct -- 12
text: CIVILIANS mixed equally of Northerners and Southerners.
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
text: We are deadlocked on the eighth ballot
dialog: as we were on the first.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FISHER
dialog: Do you think you'll ever reach a
dialog: unanimous verdict in this matter?
text: The Foreman looks troubled and weary.
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: No, your honor. I'm afraid not.
speaker_heading: JUDGE FISHER
dialog: In that case, I declare a mistrial.
dialog: The defendant is hereby free to leave.
text: But the DEFENDANT, now revealed, hardly looks free -- JOHN
text: SURRATT looks more like a prisoner of guilt.
text: His sister, ANNA, is beside him. She shows no sign of joy,
text: or even relief. Instead, she glances to the back of the
text: courtroom to FREDERICK AIKEN, just a bystander now.
text: Aiken nods to Anna. John Surratt attempts to see where Anna
text: is looking. But when he does, Aiken is long gone.
text: ...The sound of WEEPING
scene_heading: PULL BACK: INT. COURTHOUSE -- BATHROOM - SHORT WHILE LATER
text: As we reveal John Surratt is sobbing inconsolably, his face
text: buried into the wall. He senses someone watching, and turns.
text: The POV on John Surratt belongs to Aiken, who just stares at
text: him without a word. John Surratt gathers his emotions.
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
dialog: You're Frederick Aiken, aren't you?
text: Aiken nods.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT (CONT'D)
dialog: I...I never...I wish to thank you
dialog: for the kindness you showed my mother
text: Aiken says nothing.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Believe me, Mr. Aiken, I never thought
dialog: they'd kill her. Sheâ€™ committed no
dialog: crime.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Well, now you have your freedom.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
dialog: i killed my mother. I will never be
dialog: ree.
text: Neither says a word. Tears streak Surratt's face. Aiken
text: removes a white HANDKERCHIEF from his pocket.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: It belonged to her. I hope it
dialog: comforts you in your grief.
text: Aiken begins to leave.
speaker_heading: JOHN SURRATT
dialog: Keep it, Colonel. She now belongs
dialog: to you.
text: Aiken pauses a moment and decides to keep the handkerchief.
text: He exits without a word as we HOLD ON John Surratt's grief.
scene_heading: EXT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- HALLWAY - DAY
text: Aiken exits the majestic building. He is met by Catherine
text: and Baker. He spots Anna across the way, in conversation.

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It's good of you to come, Frederick.
dialog: I'd like you to meet my husband.
dialog: William Tonry, this is...
speaker_heading: WILLIAM TONRY
dialog: It's an honor, Mr. Aiken.
text: WILLIAM TONRY, mid-20s, shakes Aiken's hand.
text: Anna lovingly grabs her belly, which we now realize is
text: pregnant. Her mother's hair bracelet is apparent.
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: If she's a girl, we're naming her
dialog: Mary.
speaker_heading: AIKEN
dialog: Your mother would like that.
text: An awkward beat.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I should be getting back.
text: Anna nods sweetly.
speaker_heading: AIKEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Congratulations to you both.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM TONRY
dialog: It was nice meeting you.
text: Aiken smiles, and rejoins Catherine and Baker.
text: As they descend the Courthouse steps, several YOUNG TURKS
text: watch Aiken with a look of awe -- reminiscent of Aiken with
text: his buddies spotting luminaries at the start of the story.
text: One of the young turks begins to approach Aiken, but his
text: buddy grabs him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TURK #1
dialog: You can't just go up to him without
dialog: an introduction.
text: We pull back as Aiken crosses beneath a grand STATUE of LADY
text: JUSTICE -- a SCALE, in one hand, and SWORD, in the other
text: We continue pulling back until Aiken and the others are
text: SWALLOWED by the People below ...
