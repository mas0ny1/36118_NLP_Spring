scene_heading: EXT. BURGUNDIAN COUNTRYSIDE - SUNRISE - 1892 1
text: The first light is breaking over the fields and hedges of
text: this timeless rural landscape. With the clanking of bells,
text: a herd of cows makes its way to the first milking.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE FAMILY HOME - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 2
text: The room is simple with a few sticks of worn wooden
text: furniture. A young woman is asleep under the covers, with a
text: cat curled up on the bottom of the bed. This is GABRIELLE-
dialog: SIDONIE COLETTE, or as she will later be known, simply
speaker_heading: COLETTE.
text: A voice calls from down the corridor - her mother SIDO.
speaker_heading: SIDO (0.S.)
dialog: Gabrielle!
text: The girl stirs but her eyes remain stubbornly closed.
speaker_heading: SIDO (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Gabrielle!! Wake up.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (murmuring)
dialog: Let me sleep!
speaker_heading: SIDO
dialog: Come on, Gabrielle!!
text: Sido is now at the door frame. A handsome country woman,
dialog: forthright and practical - nobody’s fool.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: SIDO
text: It’s 8 o’clock. Willy is coming today.
text: Colette just murmurs.
speaker_heading: SIDO (cont’d) (CONT'D)
dialog: Good. Then you won’t want your
dialog: hair doing.
text: She disappears. After a moment, a head emerges from under
text: the pillow and looks to the empty doorway. We get our first
text: look at the milky skinned, precocious, whip-smart, Colette.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY TRAIN STATION - DAY 3
text: A train belches steam as it slowly moves toward the station.
text: A MAN IN A TOP HAT leans out of the window.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2.
speaker_heading: OMITTED 4
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN CARRIAGE - DAY 5
text: Dismounting, Willy sees a waiting carriage across the platform.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE - PARLOR 6
text: Wearing her best frock, Colette carries a large TEA SERVICE
text: down a corridor and into the main room. Willy is seated, in
text: conversation with Sido and JULES, the patriarch, an affable
text: old soldier, with one leg, who is smoking a pipe.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: And how is Paris these days,
dialog: Willy?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It’s a hot bed! It’s “Electric!”
dialog: Heaving with artists, writers,
dialog: poets, all seeking to say
dialog: something profound... most of them
dialog: are too young or crazed but still,
dialog: they do generate a certain... life
dialog: force!
text: Colette, her hair neatly plaited, puts the cups out for
text: everyone then takes over the teapot and pours.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: We were going to see a play in
dialog: Paris - weren’t we?
speaker_heading: SIDO
dialog: La Tosca.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I was at the opening. I wouldn’t
dialog: bother, quite frankly. Sarah Bernhardt
dialog: did her best, she always does, but the
dialog: piece is too overwrought in a
dialog: particularly feminine way...
dialog: melodramatic in extremis! Tears on the
text: stage but all dry eyes in the house.
speaker_heading: SIDO
dialog: Maybe I'11 go and make up my own mind.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Well, just remember... if a book bores
dialog: you, you can throw it away. If a
dialog: painting is garish, you close your
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 3.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Whereas bad theatre is like dentistry;
dialog: you are compelled to stay in the chair,
dialog: having your skull drilled, until the
text: entire grizzly procedure is over.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Good point, Willy. Painful business!
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Though I imagine it must hold a secret
dialog: source of enjoyment - for the dentist.
text: Willy raises an appreciative eyebrow and chuckles.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Indeed... Oh - I almost forgot. A
dialog: small gift.
text: He reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small package. She
text: unwraps it to find a SNOW GLOBE OF PARIS.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Thank you. I’ve read about these.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Shake it.
text: She does and looks, fascinated, at the twirling flakes.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Look, Sido. A snow globe.
text: She holds it up for her mother.
scene_heading: EXT. COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE — LATE AFTERNOON 7
text: M. Willy bids good-bye to Jules, Sido and Colette, before
text: the carriage moves off. Colette is holding her comfortable
text: old cat which she hands off to her mother.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Sido, I’m going for a walk.
speaker_heading: SIDO
dialog: Change your dress first.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I’1l stay on the path.
speaker_heading: SIDO
dialog: Change it!
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 4.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE - STAIRS - MINUTES LATER 8
text: Now in a different dress, Colette starts to come down stairs.
text: Hearing her parents talking in the kitchen, she slows up,
text: listening carefully.
speaker_heading: SIDO (0.S.)
dialog: There’s something about him I find
dialog: suspect... something disingenuous.
speaker_heading: JULES (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, not in my reckoning... He’s a
dialog: good man. He has a reputation,
dialog: yes, but there comes a time ina
dialog: man’s life to settle down...and
dialog: she’s the right age for it. She’ll
dialog: be twenty next time around.
speaker_heading: SIDO (0.S.)
dialog: I just worry that he won’t
dialog: understand her. That girl said her
dialog: first word at nine months. She was
dialog: always reading, way ahead of her
dialog: class, she was the lead in the
dialog: school play - every year.
speaker_heading: JULES (0.S.)
dialog: My dear, would anyone be good
dialog: enough for you?
speaker_heading: SIDO
dialog: Hmmph.
text: Now on the ground floor Colette waits outside the door as
text: her parents talk. Sido moves into view by the kitchen sink.
speaker_heading: SIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you finished the letter to
dialog: his father?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I keep starting but I can’t seem
text: to finish it. A girl without a
dialog: dowry, -that just doesn’t happen
dialog: in their circles. They may cut him
dialog: off if he marries her.
speaker_heading: SIDO
dialog: So they call it off. The world
dialog: won't end.
text: As her father talks, Colette sneaks back up the last five
dialog: stairs...
dialog: 10
dialog: 11
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 5.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Sido, he clearly adores her - he’s
dialog: visited four times. He’ll give her
dialog: status, not to mention a
dialog: tremendous cultural life - the
dialog: theater, the opera. He’1ll give her
dialog: Paris for heaven's sakes!
text: Colette comes clumping down the stairs, slightly too loudly
text: and into the room.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Can I go now?
speaker_heading: SIDO
dialog: Yes. Take this - for blackberries.
dialog: (hands her a pot)
dialog: I’m making a tart tomorrow. And
dialog: don’t be late back.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (eye roll)
dialog: I won't...
text: Sido watches her daughter, not without suspicion, as she
text: takes off across the garden.
scene_heading: EXT. SAINT-SAUVEUR — COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON 9
text: Colette runs down a path, then backs up, picks a few prime
text: blackberries, and continues on.
text: She moves through the woods, with the stealth of an animal
text: then breaks out across a broad green meadow towards a barn.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD BARN — LATE AFTERNOON 10
text: She approaches the gaping black door of a dilapidated barn.
scene_heading: INT. OLD BARN 11
text: Entering the darkness, Colette blinks to re-adjust her
text: eyes. A flutter of wings attracts her attention. She turns
text: to see an ascending pigeon. Then, below, a tired old horse.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Over here. Enjoying the simple
dialog: pleasures of country life!
text: Behind a partition, she sees Willy, reclining on a pile of
dialog: straw.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 6.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You look at home in the hay.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I think I might be! And you look like
dialog: a beautiful young country girl. Right
dialog: there. With the light...What’s that?
text: Colette shows him, putting the bowl between them as she
text: nestles beside him. Her hands are blue with the juice.
dialog: She looks
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Your fingers are stained.
dialog: (he takes her hand)
dialog: Mm... Maybe I could just leave
dialog: Paris behind.
dialog: (he takes a blackberry)
dialog: You could feed me berries. I’d catch
dialog: a fish with my teeth. Then come back
dialog: here to my cave. Like a bear. Bliss.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I'd like that.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (he caresses her braids)
dialog: Your hair is a phenomenon.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: In the village, they call me “the
dialog: girl with the hair.”
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I can see why. I’m sure you’re famous
dialog: here in your village.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: A little.
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (cont'd) (CONT'D)
dialog: How long until your train goes?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: In about 40 minutes. But I have
dialog: to walk to the station.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Normally takes me about 15
dialog: minutes. Will probably take you
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 7.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes. Right. So if my
dialog: calculations are correct...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: We have time - if we’re quick.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes, we do.
text: He smiles, moved by her beauty, kisses her, then breaks
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I just can’t say how unimaginably
dialog: happy I am, Gabrielle.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: So am I.
text: He holds her by her shoulders firmly.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I adore you.
text: He kisses her shoulder. Feeling his beard brush against her
text: skin, Colette smiles as they move into a passionate embrace. A
text: nearby horse chews hay as they proceed to take their clothes
dialog: off.
scene_heading: 11A INT. COLETTE’S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 11A
text: Colette sprawls out on the bed, her hair in plaits. She is
text: writing a letter in a school exercise book in pencil, resting
text: on an encyclopaedia.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Dear Willy, As I walked home by the
text: river, the light shining through
dialog: the trees, my heart filled with a
dialog: kind of delicious pride. After all,
dialog: you know all those fine women of
dialog: Paris...so I must have something.
dialog: (smiles to herself) )
dialog: I want to wake up next to you.
dialog: Trace your profile with my finger
dialog: while you sleep. Know that the day
dialog: is ours. That life is ours for the
dialog: taking. We will be so entire and
dialog: so happy, my love.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 8.
scene_heading: 12 EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON 12
text: At the Wedding Party, Jules is making a toast Colette and
text: Willy in front of a MIXED CROWD of WEDDING GUESTS.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: It’s the proudest time in a father’s
dialog: life, but also - I now find - one of
dialog: the saddest. I have to hand over my
dialog: beloved daughter, who has lit up our
dialog: lives for so long, with her wit, her
dialog: brilliance, her beauty. I will miss
dialog: you, Gabrielle. Almost as much as
dialog: your mother will...
text: A murmur of acknowledgement from the assembled. Colette
text: smiles at her father, and catches her mother’s eye, holding
dialog: back emotion.
speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D)
dialog: But it is no small compensation that I
dialog: give her to a man of such inestimable
dialog: standing. There are many celebrities
dialog: in Paris but few are famous enough to
dialog: be known by -- by a single name.
dialog: WILLY - Welcome to the Colette family.
text: Everyone cheers. Colette turns to her new husband,
dialog: glowing.
scene_heading: SOME TIME LATER - EVENING
text: A COUNTRY BAND strikes up. COUPLES polka around the
dialog: garden.
text: A COUPLE OF PEASANTS carry trays of drinks from a kitchen
text: tent to the GUESTS. Some CHILDREN chase a chicken through the
dialog: dancers.
speaker_heading: WILLY (cont'd)
dialog: This is definitely a country wedding.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It’ll make a good story -- in Paris.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You'll be the story in Paris,
dialog: Gabrielle. Just wait ‘til they
dialog: get a look at you.
text: Willy twirls Colette round and round and round...
dialog: 13
dialog: 14
dialog: 15
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 9.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY OF PARIS - EVENING - 1893 13
text: Across the river Seine - the center of the demi-monde; the
dialog: Left Bank. This is not postcard Paris - the buildings are
text: sooty and chimneys are filling the sky with smoke. On the
text: quay, PEOPLE go about their business as a YOUNG ATTENDANT
text: lights the gas lamp.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - BOUDOIR - EVENING 14
text: MATILDE, the maid, is winching Colette into a very tight
text: red froufrou dress. A knock on the door.
speaker_heading: WILLY (0.8)
dialog: Are you ready yet?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No - not yet.
dialog: (to the maid)
dialog: What do you think, Matilde?
speaker_heading: MATILDE
dialog: It’s pretty, Madame.
text: Colette looks at herself critically.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM/HALLWAY 15
text: Willy returns and prepares to knock again.
speaker_heading: WILLY (0.8)
dialog: We should try to get there before
dialog: it ends.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m coming...
text: The door opens. Colette is in another dress - the one from
text: their meeting in Saint-Sauveur. Matilde hovers nervously.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Is the carriage waiting?
text: Willy looks disappointed but together they proceed through
text: SEVERAL ROOMS to the front door. We get a feeling for Willy's
text: apartment - a warren of dark rooms overcrowded by boxes, papers
text: and Wagnerian bric-a-brac. Willy, it seems, is a hoarder.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Where’s your new dress?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It looks ridiculous. I couldn't
dialog: breathe in it.
dialog: 16
dialog: 17
dialog: 18
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 10.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: That thing cost me two hundred and
dialog: thirty-seven francs.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I know. We'll get it adjusted.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (half joking)
dialog: More money!
text: They exit.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEGANT PARISIAN STREET — EARLY EVENING 16
text: The carriage pulls up. Colette is fiddling with a spot of
text: tooth powder on her dress.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: ...It’s tooth paste.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (amused)
dialog: My God! Here...
text: He rubs a little spit on it.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: That’1ll do. Let’s go in...
scene_heading: INT. MME. DE CAILLAVET’S SALON — HALLWAY 17
text: They approach the giant door.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Ready for the lions...?
text: She lets out a nervous exhale. The double doors glide open.
scene_heading: INT. MADAME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - MAIN ROOM 18
text: Willy and Colette proceed into a reception room filled with
dialog: the beautiful, the sparkling, and the eccentric of Paris’
dialog: Golden Age. The mirrors have been polished; so have the
text: epigrams. Amidst the gas lamps, the India rubber plants,
text: and the zebra skin rugs, the energy is bouncing off the
dialog: walls.
text: Willy acknowledges hellos and nods to people along the way.
text: With her tight braids and country dress, Colette looks drab
text: in this sea of peacocks.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 11.
text: They arrive at a circle of conversation -- that of MME. DE
text: CAILLAVET, the hostess, the debonair COUNT MUFFAT, and a
text: few SALONITES and FRIENDS.
scene_heading: MME. DE CAILLAVET
dialog: It’s monstrous. I can’t look at
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: COUNT MUFFAT
dialog: At least it’s temporary.
scene_heading: MME. DE CAILLAVET
dialog: Oh here’s Willy -- Willy! Eiffel’s
dialog: Tower, are you for or against?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I’m for it, if a little jealous of this
dialog: giant erection in the heart of our
dialog: capital... belonging to someone else.
text: Laughter from the circle.
scene_heading: MME. DE CAILLAVET
dialog: You rogue, Willy. And you’ve
dialog: brought a... an orphaned relative?
speaker_heading: COUNT MUFFAT
dialog: A secret love child?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (acknowledging their mockery)
dialog: Very good... May I present to you
dialog: my wife, Gabrielle-Sidonie
dialog: Colette.
text: Colette curtsies politely, her cheeks flushing.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Pleased to meet you.
scene_heading: MME. DE CAILLAVET
text: Delighted. Well, astonished
dialog: actually. You have caught the
dialog: slipperiest eel... How does one do
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I’m not sure...
text: Colette smiles, a little nervously.
scene_heading: MME. DE CAILLAVET
dialog: Where are you from, you sweet thing?
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 12.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I’m from Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye...
dialog: (no reaction)
dialog: ...it’s in Burgundy.
scene_heading: MME. DE CAILLAVET
dialog: Hence the dress!
speaker_heading: COUNT MUFFAT
dialog: Have you “relocated,” Willy?
text: This is apparently hilarious and there is laughter.
scene_heading: MME. DE CAILLAVET
dialog: Tst...ignore him... But how on
dialog: earth did you two meet?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Our fathers served together in the army...
speaker_heading: COUNT MUFFAT
dialog: (riding over her)
dialog: Willy married! The wild days are done,
dialog: eh?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You’re quite mistaken, sir. The
text: wild days have just begun.
text: Willy smiles at his new bride’s moxie. A business-like
text: young man rushes up to Willy. This is PIERRE VEBER.
speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: Willy, thank God you're back. That
dialog: short story for La Forgue —
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Pierre. Let me introduce you to my
dialog: wife, Gabrielle.
speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: What..? Very pleased to meet you.
text: Before she can speak, he turns to Willy with a more urgent tone.
speaker_heading: VEBER (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s due on Tuesday and you
dialog: haven’t given me the slightest
dialog: clue.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Amuse yourself for a moment, Gabrielle.
dialog: 19
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 13.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I will.
text: Willy draws Veber aside to continue the shop talk.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It’s simple - an eight hundred word
dialog: sketch. Small coastal resort, damp
dialog: bathing-costumes. The perfect place to
text: rejuvenate a de-iodized constitution.
text: A buxom girl approaches, long legs...
text: Colette is left standing by herself. Nearby, a silver tray
text: displays a living turtle with an exquisitely jeweled shell.
text: She takes a lettuce leaf from a salad dish and feeds it.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Poor thing. You want the earth and
dialog: the grass don’t you?
text: Across the room she sees Willy, with Veber, lifting the glass
text: on a wall candle and lighting a cigar.
text: Feeling out of sorts, she moves through to an adjacent room
dialog: where...
scene_heading: INT. MME. DE CAILLAVET’S SALON — MUSIC ROOM 19
text: A STRING QUARTET is giving a recital to the assembled.
text: Across the room a group of SALONITES are clearly discussing
text: her. Embarrassed, Colette finds an empty seat. She looks
text: across the room - the salonites are still whispering.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: Are your ears burning?
text: Colette looks up and sees - Marcel SCHWOB, an intellectual
text: with a humane gleam in his eye. He sits next to her.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m Schwob, a friend of Willy's.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Hello. I’m Gabrielle. Willy
dialog: described you to me.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: I hope he was kind.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (wryly)
dialog: Hope costs nothing.
dialog: 20
dialog: 21
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 14.
text: Schwob raises an amused eyebrow, then looks out into the
text: room where people are stealing glances at them.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: The modern day mob, aren’t they?
dialog: (Colette nods)
dialog: But their goddess is gossip instead of the
dialog: guillotine. Are you feeling overwhelmed?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
text: They may look grand and intimidating.
dialog: But just imagine them shitting. Each
dialog: and every one of them.
text: Colette looks at him, incredulous.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB (CONT’D)
dialog: Well they all do, don’t they?
text: Across the room, AN IMPORTANT-LOOKING GENTLEMAN, waves to
dialog: Schwob.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB (CONT’D)
dialog: (to the Gentleman)
dialog: Good evening, Sir!
dialog: (to Colette)
dialog: Try it.
speaker_heading: AEROPLANE VERSION
speaker_heading: SCHWOB (CONT'D)
dialog: They may look grand and
dialog: intimidating. But just imagine
text: them perched over a chamber pot.
dialog: Each and every one of them.
scene_heading: INT. MADAME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - VARIOUS ROOMS 20
text: We follow Colette as she searches for Willy in the sea of
text: SOCIALITES. She walks through rooms where PEOPLE are now
text: dancing in an avant garde fashion then through a series of
text: SMALLER COMPARTMENTS, where SERVANTS are polishing glasses
text: and CHEFS are preparing hors d’oeuvres, past palms and oil
text: lamps, to a distant room at the far end of the salon.
scene_heading: INT. MME. DE CAILLAVET’S SALON — SMOKING ROOM 21
text: From the doorway, Colette spies Willy leaning on the
text: mantelpiece talking to a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in a red
text: dress. The woman leans in close to him, laughing. He
text: whispers something and she laughs even harder.
dialog: 22
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 15.
text: There's a shrieking coming from the corner of the main room.
text: Colette turns to sees the crowd laughing as a BOHEMIAN pours
text: milk into an upright piano.
scene_heading: INT. HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE — MOVING — NIGHT 22
text: Colette looks out the window into the night-time streets.
text: After a moment, Willy ventures a question.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: So what did you think of the
dialog: salon?
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: That was essentially - what you
dialog: witnessed tonight - everyone who’s
dialog: anyone in Paris...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Was it..?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Who did you like? Who did you talk to?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I liked the tortoise. I think he
dialog: was as bored as I was.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I suspect you were more
dialog: intimidated than bored?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No. I found them...shallow. Pretentious.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Ah, you're reading them wrongly. It’s
dialog: not pretension so much as
dialog: exaggeration. The ideal is to be
dialog: authentic yet larger than life. To
dialog: present a personality with a capital
dialog: P. You could do it too with your
dialog: country girl charm ...
text: She turns to him.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Did that woman have a capital P?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Which one?
dialog: 23
dialog: 24
dialog: 25
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 16.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: The one you were talking to? In
dialog: the red dress. With the breasts?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Nicole D’Allier? That was just...
dialog: flirtation. It means absolutely
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Then why do it?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It’s what one does... to pass the time.
dialog: It staves off boredom. You’re reading
dialog: it all completely wrong.
text: Colette sighs, frustrated. Willy changes tack.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Maybe...
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Forget about all of them now. Any way -
dialog: haven’t you heard the news? Willy is
dialog: married. Happily married. And he’s
text: going home with his bride, who he
dialog: loves very much.
text: Colette nods, looks at him with a half-smile. He is forgiven.
scene_heading: EXT. PARIS STREET 23
text: The carriage rides off into the distance.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S BUILDING - STAIRCASE - MORNING 24
text: From directly above, we see Pierre Veber dash up the
dialog: stairs.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - ENTRANCE ROOM 25
text: Colette is seated at a desk, carefully roughing out a
text: letter. She writes a line then crosses it out, rephrases
dialog: it.
text: There’s a knock at the door. Veber enters in the hallway
text: and looks through to Colette’s small room where she sits
text: with a large pile of correspondence.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Hello, Veber.
dialog: 26
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 17.
speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: Gabrielle. It’s cold out there today.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I’m under house arrest so it
dialog: doesn’t affect me.
dialog: (gestures to the other room)
text: Schwob’s already in there.
text: We follow Veber through the maze-like apartment to Willy's
text: office. He passes through the front room which is semi-dark,
text: its furniture covered by dust sheets.
scene_heading: INT. WILLY’S STUDY 26
text: Willy, mid-flow, barely notices Veber enter. Schwob sits by

dialog: melodramatic swamp! Or... it released
text: the toxins of man’s very soul, leaving
text: the audience pale, and nauseous as
dialog: though having eaten a bad oyster.”
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: It’s a bit extreme. The ending was

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Hmmph - I prefer my version.

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The factory’s on fire... We’re on
dialog: fire...! Sit. I’ve hada
dialog: remarkable idea - it could be,
dialog: anyway...
speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I’m going to launch a novel.
speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We've had stories by Willy, music
dialog: reviews by Willy. Now Willy’s first
dialog: novel. There’1l be enough literature
dialog: in it to appeal to the high-brows and
dialog: enough filth for the great unwashed.
speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: And who's going to write it?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: -.-You are!
text: Veber shakes his head, absorbing this.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Brandy? Cigar?
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE ROOM 27
text: Schwob stops to chat to Colette by the desk. Matilde is
text: stoking the fire.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: Are you writing for him too? He’s
dialog: made you one of his ghosts
dialog: already?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Just letters...
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: You're fastidious... exacting.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: A lot of crossing out, you mean.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: ...well, yes.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 19.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy copies them out afterwards -
text: so they are in his handwriting.
speaker_heading: MATILDE
dialog: No one has handwriting like M. Willy.
scene_heading: 28 INT. WILLY’S STUDY 28
text: Willy is completely absorbed in his pitch, sweat beading
text: from his forehead as he paces.
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: He first sees her, Monna, held aloft on
text: the shoulders of her admirers.. She’s
dialog: eighteen, beautiful, wild and she’s from
dialog: the streets, eats men up, never wears a
dialog: corset. And our hero, Renaud - a writer,
text: a genius - he’s captivated by her. She
text: seduces him in her shabby rooms - five
dialog: entire days of carnal bliss - but she has
text: a powerful hold over him. She
text: instinctively understands his base
dialog: desires. We wonder - will Renaud escape -
dialog: go back to his wholesome friends and his
dialog: burgeoning career - or will he be dragged
text: down by her toxic embrace, forgetting all
dialog: about writing to live forever in a sexual
dialog: quagmire. .?
text: Willy ends with a flourish, eyes slightly damp.
scene_heading: 29 INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT 29
text: Colette gets up from her desk, as Willy escorts Veber

speaker_heading: WILLY

speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: Two or three months?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No no...weeks, Veber! It has to be weeks!
dialog: Write for four hours at a time...
speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: All right... I’1l1 come back to you if
dialog: I get stuck.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 20.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes...Just write it...and fast!
dialog: Let’s get some money coming in.
speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: Goodbye, Gabrielle.
text: She waves. The door closes on Veber. A piece of wallpaper
text: has pulled free of the wall. Willy rubs it back in place.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Chaos. Working in these
text: conditions. Absolute...chaos.
text: Willy comes over to his wife and kisses her as they walk
text: back into the front room.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: You’ve married a literary
dialog: entrepreneur. What a phenomenal
dialog: disaster.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You’ve married a country girl. Not a
dialog: penny to her name.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We're utterly doomed aren’t we?
text: They both laugh. She hands him the rough draft of the
text: letter. He peruses it quickly.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Perfect... but how about; “The
dialog: contract you have sent me seems
dialog: eminently fair, with only one
dialog: shortcoming - the money.” Always
dialog: pump something up before you prick
dialog: it. You get more of a “POP” that
dialog: way.
text: Unexpectedly, Willy farts.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Intimacy in all its savage

scene_heading: INT. THEATRE - NIGHT 32

scene_heading: INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - ENTRANCE ROOM - DAY 33

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 35

scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - AFTERNOON 39

scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - LATE AFTERNOON 40
text: Colette walks across the courtyard, up the stairs, across a

speaker_heading: LOTTE

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: But for that money I could be laid
text: five times as often by a prostitute.
scene_heading: EXT. LOTTE’S KINCELER’S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 42
text: There’s the sound of a woman’s raucous laughter. Colette
text: turns to see TWO SEX-WORKERS across the courtyard. As she
text: turns back, Willy sees her at the window. Lotte
text: instinctively grabs a pair of dressmakers scissors.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Ah, my dear. You’ve come to fetch
dialog: me.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - LATE AFTERNOON 43
text: Now walking back down the stairs, Colette is struggling

scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 23.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: She’s not a disreputable woman.
dialog: There’s even a play about her - it’s a
dialog: shit play but nevertheless... I wonder
dialog: who the hell wrote that letter?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I don’t care who wrote it.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: She’s no rival to you, Gabrielle.
dialog: I promise, I’1l never sleep with
dialog: her again. But - you have to
dialog: understand - this is what men do.
dialog: We are the weaker sex. We don’t
dialog: have your strength. We are simply
dialog: slaves to our urges. And here in
dialog: the city - it’s perfectly
dialog: acceptable to...
text: Colette flies at him with inarticulate rage.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I don’t accept it! You’ve been lying to

dialog: because you say we have no money.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It’s true - we have no money.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Because you spend it all on her!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I really don’t!
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Then when you get into our bed...and I

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I’ve been inattentive. I’1l make amends.

speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: SIDO

scene_heading: EXT. SIDO’S KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY 47

speaker_heading: SIDO
dialog: Agh - ants. There must be honeydew...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (feels the leaf)
dialog: Yes.. it’s sticky.
speaker_heading: SIDO
dialog: The white flies have probably got to it.
dialog: They'll have sucked all the juice.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: We need some ladybirds?
speaker_heading: SIDO

speaker_heading: SIDO
dialog: In what way?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: As a wife... or a mother... That you

speaker_heading: SIDO

speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t feel like myself at all.
dialog: Everything seems...utterly

dialog: You mean more to me than all the

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Have you sampled them all?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Please don’t mock me.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You’re happy to mock everybody

speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 28.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: but if you trace mine to their source -

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I wouldn’t credit that as the organ
dialog: of origin.
text: He snorts.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You know me too well.
speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: That’s wonderful. Did you make it up?

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I won't. Never again! I promise.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I don’t want to be treated like a

dialog: May be. I want to be... part of

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You will be. You will be part of

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I’m being serious.

speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No - but she was always with me.
scene_heading: 49 INT. COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE - BEDROOM 49

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Sometimes she could be sweet.. but
dialog: she could also be very annoying.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: In what way?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Well, she was clumsy, more than
dialog: anything. One day in winter, when
dialog: the first snows started, I made a
text: compact little snowball and
dialog: smuggled it into the classroom. As
dialog: Miss Terrain was writing I passed
dialog: it along to the next person..
text: She strips down to her underclothes, shivers slightly.

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Get out! Both of you! This is harassment!
speaker_heading: SCHWOB

speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: This is the third time I’ve had to

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Then stop coming round and bloody
dialog: well asking!
speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: I am close to being evicted. You

scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 31.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: And I will - by Friday.
speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: You said that last week.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB

speaker_heading: WILLY

speaker_heading: VEBER
dialog: You'd better bloody have it!

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Damn them! They’d never get
dialog: published by themselves. I lend them
dialog: my name, my reputation... I take all
dialog: the risk. And there’s no money. We
dialog: simply need more output.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You could get another writer in.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: And pay them with what? We only have
dialog: about 1000 coming in this month - 300
dialog: from the Echo, 425 for the next vamp

dialog: But it doesn’t cover our outgoings.
speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: WILLY

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I’m just saying we could

dialog: the pennies and..”
text: Then lightning strikes...
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You... You!
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You could write them up. Those stories of
dialog: Saint-Sauveur you told me last year. They
dialog: could be Willy’s next novel.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: My school stories?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes. There may be something
dialog: there...You must start straight
dialog: away, my love. Aim for four hours

speaker_heading: WILLY

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I’ve changed a few things...for the

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Don’t worry about the facts. You can

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: So I should just write what I want?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes! No one will ever dispute it - and

speaker_heading: COLETTE (V.O.)
dialog: “I feel so much alone there, my eyes
text: lost far away amongst the trees, in the
text: green, mysterious daylight that is at
text: once deliciously peaceful and a little
dialog: unnerving because of the loneliness and
dialog: the vague darkness.”
scene_heading: INT. WILLY’S STUDY - MORNING 57
text: There’s a pile of five notebooks on Willy’s desk with a
text: ribbon round them and a label that says “For Willy.”
text: Seated behind his desk, Willy unties the precious package,
text: picks up the first book and settles in to read it.
text: After a few pages he takes a cigar and lights it.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 58
text: Colette is playing with TOBY CHIEN on the floor. She gets
text: up and looks at the grandfather clock in the hall - 1:30.
scene_heading: HALF AN HOUR LATER
text: Willy emerges with the books. Colette is on the sofa with
text: the dog, a novel open in front of her. He smiles,
text: congratulatory but awkward.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What?
dialog: 59
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 35.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Well... there we are. You did it.
dialog: I take my hat off to you.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It’s... beautiful. I spent the
dialog: whole day in Saint-Sauveur.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You don’t like it?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I do...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Truth?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes. The nature descriptions
dialog: are... charming.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: “Charming...?”
text: Willy heads off to boudoir.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes, perfectly charming! Sorry, I
dialog: need to take a piss.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What else?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Nothing - really - it’s a truly
dialog: wonderful depiction.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT —- BEDROOM 59
text: She follows him into the bedroom. He goes into the adjoining
text: boudoir, takes out a chamber pot and starts pissing. She
text: flops onto the bed.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: ..-And?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We won't be able to get it
dialog: published is the shame of it...
dialog: 60
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 36.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What's wrong with it?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Honestly...?
text: She nods. He takes a breath.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: So...I’1l treat you like any other
dialog: writer I’m giving a report to, shall
dialog: I?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Except I love you. I adore you.
dialog: Let’s be clear about that.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Just tell me.
text: He finishes up, zips up, and comes into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: There’s nothing driving it. No
text: plot. A novel by Willy... It grips
dialog: you from page one. Yours has...
dialog: (he gestures)
dialog: ...too many adjectives. Some of
dialog: the characters are interesting but
dialog: overall... Well, it’s just too
text: cloying. Too...feminine.
text: She says nothing, stares at the floor, anger mounting.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Well that was a waste of nine
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Not if you enjoyed it.
text: Not wanting to break in front of Willy, she storms off,
text: through the apartment.
scene_heading: INT. WILLY’S STUDY 60
text: Colette slams the door behind her, eyes brimming with
text: tears. She opens the notebook and looks at the first page.
dialog: It says, “School Notes by Gabrielle-Sidonie Colette.” She
text: takes a pen, crosses out her name.
dialog: 61
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 37.
text: And stops, leaving the single word “Colette.” She looks at
text: it for a moment, tears in her eyes, and underlines it.
scene_heading: INT. MME. DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - MUSIC ROOM - EVENING 61
text: A makeshift stage, where the famous mime artist, WAGUE,
text: performs a lip-sync sketch, accompanied by a PIANIST and a
text: FEMALE SINGER. The audience is transfixed by his mastery of
dialog: the form.
text: Colette and Schwob are at the edge of the crowd. Colette is
text: dressed in black and white, her style feels modern and edgy -
text: well ahead of the fussily-dressed socialites.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Wague’s mesmerizing, isn’t he?
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: Yes - he’s the king of
dialog: cantomime...
text: The song plays out its last few lines. Everyone bursts into
dialog: applause.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s get a drink.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Two champagne glasses are taken off a tray.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (to the servant)
dialog: Thank you, Geraud.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: Cheers.
text: They clink glasses.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB (CONT'D)
dialog: How’s it going with your book?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It’s gone. I tried but it wasn’t
dialog: any good.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: I can’t believe it.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy hated it. I don’t care. I don’t
dialog: need to leave a mark on this world.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 38.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Give me a flock of starlings and
dialog: that will intoxicate me. Something
dialog: real. Not just doing lines for the
dialog: headmaster..
dialog: (takes a moment)
dialog: Did you always write, Schwob?
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: I didn’t really have a choice. It was
dialog: simply... There.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Does it make you happy?
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: Oh god no! I do it to prevent me
dialog: from going mad. But sometimes,
dialog: occasionally, it will transport
dialog: me.
text: This registers with Colette. Despite her bravura - she misses
text: it. They are interrupted by a beautiful couple; GASTON and
scene_heading: JEANNE de CAILLAVET.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: Hello Schwob! Good to see you.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: Hello Gaston, Jeanne. Do you know
dialog: Colette?
speaker_heading: JEANNE
dialog: I think we've been introduced
dialog: but... I don’t remember that name.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
text: It’s new - in a manner of speaking.
speaker_heading: JEANNE
dialog: Well then, I will think of this as
dialog: our first meeting.
text: Schwob looks from one to the other, sensing a definite
dialog: energy.
scene_heading: INT. MME. DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - ENTRY ROOM 62
text: Madame de Caillavet is demonstrating the newly installed
text: LIGHT SWITCH to WILLY, who seems distracted.
scene_heading: MME. DE CAILLAVET
dialog: It’s so easy. On and off. No more
dialog: sooty candles.
speaker_heading: 62a
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 39.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes, maybe one day they will do my
dialog: building.
scene_heading: MME. DE CAILLAVET
dialog: It’s so much safer too. Even if the
text: light is a little... bright.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Indeed. If you’1ll excuse me.
text: Willy makes his exit and looks through the crowd for
text: Colette. He rounds a corner and sees, through one room in
text: which PEOPLE ARE DANCING, into a far room where Colette,
text: GASTON and JEANNE DE CAILLAVET are sitting together.
scene_heading: INT. MME. DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - SMOKING ROOM 62a
text: The newly introduced friends are all already quite tipsy.
text: They are sitting in front of a MIRRORED WALL that reflects
text: the DANCERS. Gaston is reading Colette’s palm. As Willy
text: stares, a flicker of jealousy passes through his eyes.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: You have a long life line. Very
dialog: strong head line - here. And your
text: love line splits in three.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: And what could that mean?
speaker_heading: JEANNE
dialog: Who knows?
text: Gaston laughs, somewhat flirtatiously.
speaker_heading: GASTON
text: So many intersecting lines.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I have the hands of a man - see.
text: She measures up to Gaston - hers are larger.
speaker_heading: JEANNE
dialog: You have a touch of Hermes,
dialog: Colette. There’s something
dialog: androgynous about you.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: No, I know what it is. You’ve the
dialog: soul of Narcissus! Filled with
dialog: sensuality and bitterness.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 40.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: My soul is filled with beans and
dialog: bacon rinds. You’1l find nothing
dialog: else there.
text: They all laugh. Willy arrives in front of them.
speaker_heading: GASTON DE CAILLAVET
dialog: Willy, you ogre, how are you? We've
dialog: been greatly enjoying the company of
dialog: Colette - now she is no longer hiding
text: her light under a bushel.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Quoting the good book, Gaston? You
dialog: may remember a little verse about
text: coveting other men’s wives.
speaker_heading: GASTON
dialog: And you may remember one about not
dialog: trying to remove a speck from your
dialog: brother’s eye with a log in your own.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Touché Gaston. Your wits are improving...
dialog: somewhat. We’d better go now, darling.
scene_heading: 63 INT. CARRIAGE - MOVING - NIGHT 63
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: His first play was absolute
dialog: rubbish - but his mother runs a
dialog: salon, so of course it was a huge
dialog: success and he was praised to the
dialog: skies for his brilliant “writing”
dialog: and sublime “talent.” Unctuous
dialog: prick... He was after you.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy, he’s not that type. Besides
dialog: they just got married.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: They’re no longer on honeymoon, my
dialog: dear.
text: Colette looks at him, slightly amused...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Your jealousy is misplaced.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Why so..?
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 41.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It was actually his wife I found
dialog: interesting.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Jeanne?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Willy considers this.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: What would you think of that?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Well, that’s a different case.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It is?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Perhaps...
text: Willy smiles to himself.
scene_heading: 64 INT. STAIRCASE - DAY 64
text: From above we see two burly men ascending the staircase.
scene_heading: 65 INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - DAY - 1898 65
text: A knock at the door. Colette answers to two rough-looking
dialog: bailiffs.
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Good Morning, Ma’am. I need to speak
dialog: to the gentleman of the house.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Monsieur Henri Gautier Villar - Is
dialog: he in?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You can speak to me about whatever
dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Sorry ma’am.
text: Willy walks up the hallway.
dialog: 66
dialog: 67
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 42.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes. What is it?
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Sir, I have a repossession order for
dialog: two arm chairs, one armoire, one oak
dialog: desk.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Do you have the court papers?
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Here you are. All in order.
text: Willy surveys them and resigned, steps to the side.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy?
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: It’s only bits of wood.
dialog: (to the Bailiffs)
text: The chairs are in the front parlour.
text: Armoire’s in the bedroom.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: With all my clothes in...
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Clear it out! I’1l see to the desk.
text: She storms off in exasperation. Willy goes into the office.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - OFFICE 66
text: The desk is surrounded by piles of paper and envelopes. He
text: clears the papers out of the second lowest drawer and opens
text: the bottom drawer. Inside are a stack of school notebooks —
text: Colette’s novel. He picks them out of the drawer.
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Take it! Take it away!
text: He opens the book and flips through a few pages. Then a few
dialog: more, his curiosity aroused.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - DAY 67
text: Willy sits on a single chair in the middle of the room.
text: This time he’s engaged - gripped! He makes margin notes in
text: spidery handwriting.
dialog: 68
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 43.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I am a bloody idiot.
text: Then, he skips back to the first page where it says “School
text: Notes by (crossing out) Colette.” He neatly rips out the
text: page and screws it up.
scene_heading: INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - WILLY’S STUDY — NIGH@&8
text: In a pool of gaslight, Willy and Colette are seated at the
text: desk. Willy is going through his notes.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: ..-example, “it’s a lovely spring
dialog: morning,” liven it up. How about:
dialog: (grand gesture)
dialog: “Perhaps it’s the season. It’s too
dialog: fine - almost disgracefully fine.”
text: She scribbles it down.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: And page 29 - that scene with
dialog: Luce.
dialog: (he finds it)
dialog: I’ve added: “she brushes up
dialog: against me suggestively, her blue
text: eyes half closed and her mouth
dialog: half-open.”
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: That’s quite louche.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Louche sells, my dear. Trust me -
dialog: all we need is a little more spice,
dialog: a little less literature. I know
dialog: what men want. And so do the
dialog: publishers.
text: Colette ponders this for a moment - not completely satisfied.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: And you really think they’1l take
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes! Ollendorff will go nuts for it.
speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: RACHILDE
dialog: ",..Claudine is a young girl froma

scene_heading: INT. BOOK SHOP - DAY 74

dialog: He is, if that book is anything to go by.

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Look at him. I haven’t seen him as

dialog: Well, we’ve never had one fly off

dialog: a phenomenon. Everyone’s talking
dialog: about it. And you know who’s buying
dialog: it? Young women!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: 46.
dialog: Really, I thought...that’s interesting.
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: We've also been having enquiries about
dialog: theatrical rights. Any thoughts?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Of course, the theatre is the next logical
dialog: step! With as large a stage as possible!
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: It’s the theatre-going public
dialog: which will make you rich, Willy.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Make us all rich, my dear Ollendorff.
text: They laugh as they leave the room.
scene_heading: EXT. PUBLISHING HOUSE

text: and Ollendorff coming down the stairs, talking
text: but can’t quite make out what they are saying.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: So what size are you thinking of..?
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: Perhaps - 20,000 units or 25,000
dialog: somewhere in that ballpark. I’m
dialog: waiting to see what the pre-orders
dialog: are like back from the sellers.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: And what kind of return would that

speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: Well, we’re calculating about 3

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Excellent.
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: I believe that Willy based

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Yes, I believe I had a little

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What. .?
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 48.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Finally...finally we’ve a success.
dialog: And then you imply that I’m not
dialog: the true author of it.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I didn’t... Most books are “based
dialog: on” something.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Listen, we’re holding dynamite here.
dialog: We have created something very
dialog: powerful. But if it goes off at the
dialog: wrong time it will blow our bloody

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It was only Ollendorff. He’s your
dialog: publisher, Willy.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Schwob also said something.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
text: Schwob’s part of the factory.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: People love to talk. They’1l praise
dialog: you to your face, but as soon as you
dialog: turn around...Tch! The knives are in
dialog: your back. You don’t know the
dialog: mentality here. I do.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I know it well enough to write a
dialog: book that’s the toast of Paris.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Shout it to the streets then. Tell
dialog: people. Roll up for the
dialog: massacre...
text: Colette sighs, Willy really is quite upset. The matter
text: seems to cut to the core of his identity.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m sorry. Perhaps I
dialog: overreacted... Anyway, I’ve a
dialog: surprise for you.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 49,
speaker_heading: WILLY

dialog: Douglas Fir.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: And that one?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
text: Chestnut...A weeping Chestnut.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I don’t know why you love nature so
dialog: much. Animals are vile to each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Animals are honest at least. They
dialog: never lie.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Well yes, my dear, that is because
dialog: they can’t speak.
text: They come out of the trees into a clearing. There is a
text: small lawn in front of a neoclassical country home.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Look at that!
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Yes, it’s somebody's house.
dialog: 83
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 50.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Wonder who lives there.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It’s beautiful.
speaker_heading: WILLY

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy, they might shoot at us!
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY 83
text: Willy and Colette stand at the door. He knocks and rings a

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Wait... they might be upstairs.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Or deaf... They’ve been deafened
dialog: by all the country silence.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Shhh... I thought I heard something.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Give me a kiss.
text: Willy is on good form and charming Colette. She kisses him,

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Someone might come.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Good...

speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Put your hand in my pocket.

scene_heading: INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 84

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: ...-Whose house is it?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: For you, my love, my heart. Lest
dialog: Paris drive you mad.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It’s yours. You’re always talking
dialog: about missing the countryside.
text: Willy kisses the key and gives it to Colette
text: him and then again at the house.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy, I can’t believe it.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Somewhere for you to write. And be

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: So...where did you get the money?
speaker_heading: WILLY

speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: WILLY

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy...
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We'll talk about the details
dialog: later.
text: (he looks up at the
dialog: house)
dialog: So...do you like it?
text: Colette takes in the house’s impressive dimensions.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It’s indescribable.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No such word. A good writer should
dialog: be able to describe anything no
dialog: matter what.
scene_heading: INT. COUNTRY HOUSE — LIVING ROOM — DAY 85
text: Inside, WORKERS are scraping the paint off the living room

scene_heading: INT. COUNTRY HOUSE 85a
text: Two workers carry in a sofa. Colette follows carrying a chair.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY 86
text: Colette digs a wild patch of garden. She is sweaty and covered
text: in earth but hugely exhausted and content. She plants carrots,
text: turnips and sweet pea shoots below their sticks.
text: In the background, we see the hoops of an OUTDOOR GYM.
scene_heading: INT. COUNTRY HOUSE — LIVING ROOM — DAY 88
text: Colette watches from the window as a carriage pulls into

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER 89
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: This is it? Your total output for
dialog: all these weeks?
text: Willy stands, holding a few manuscript pages.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I had to do the house - all the repairs.
text: The painting, the tiling...pruning the
dialog: roses.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Bugger the roses. We have a deadline.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It’s actually harder to write out
dialog: here... Alone. And I don’t want to
dialog: write another Claudine.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Are you out of your mind? Claudine
dialog: is a franchise! Do you realize how
dialog: rare this moment is? When people
dialog: are begging for more? Come.
text: He walks her through the house and up the stairs.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: What would the headmaster do if
dialog: Claudine had not done her
dialog: homework?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy. Don’t be silly.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (serious)
dialog: What would he do?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Make her do lines? Put her over
dialog: his knee and tan her hide?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Correct.
text: He arrives at the door of the study and stands expectantly
text: at the door jamb as she walks past him into the study.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I‘1l start tomorrow.

dialog: 91
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 54.

speaker_heading: COLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: No! Willy!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Write!
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy!!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You will do as I say! I will return in
dialog: four hours and I expect to see pages.
text: He pockets the key and goes off.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS 90
text: Frustrated, she tries the door handle. It’s locked.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy!! This isn’t funny.
text: She bangs on the door, anger building.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: LET ME OUT!!
dialog: (kicks the door.)
dialog: Bastard...absolute...arrogant
dialog: bastard! I’1l write the bloody
dialog: book! And I‘’11 tell them it was
dialog: me! Me! Me who wrote it! Bastard!
dialog: I‘11 tell them! Claudine is mine!
dialog: Mine!
text: She stands back breathing hard. Then turns with a look of
text: resignation to the writing desk.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: She sits for a moment, still smarting from the exchange, dips
text: her pen in the ink and writes “Claudine in Paris.”
scene_heading: EXT. BOOK SHOP WINDOW - DAY 91
dialog: Close on a book - CLAUDINE IN PARIS
text: It is revealed as part of a HUGE shop display. A LARGE SIGN

scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 55.
scene_heading: EXT. BOIS DE BOULOGNE - DAY 92
text: A beautiful day, PARISIANS are promenading and riding
text: bicycles and velocipedes in the open air. Colette and Willy
text: are pedaling a tandem. She’s at the front, putting in most of
text: the leg work, he, true to form, is taking it easy at the
dialog: back.
text: Under the trees, a cafe has been set up with delicate folding
text: chairs and small round tables. A few dozen SOCIETY TYPES are
text: enjoying tea and cakes.
text: Depositing their tandem by a tree. Colette and Willy
text: approach. There is a feeling that all eyes are on them.
text: Walking through the tables they go past a beautiful red-headed
text: heiress, named GEORGIE Raoul Duval. She is taking tea with her
text: companion, a pretty young girl named LILY.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Colette and Willy are here!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: So they are. Don’t stare.
text: Across the patio, Colette and Willy are seated by a WAITER.
text: Georgie takes out a small card and scribbles a note.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go take this to them.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Post-exercise the couple are eating cake.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Mmmm. It’s good.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Indeed.
text: He looks round.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: How many people here do you think
dialog: are reading Claudine in Paris -
dialog: right now?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I don’t know.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 56.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: At least three quarters, I'd say.
dialog: And those who haven’t yet will soon
dialog: catch up.
text: He notices Lily weaving through the tables towards them.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: What comes this way?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: M. Willy, Mme. Colette, I have a note
dialog: for you....from Mrs. Raoul Duval.
text: Clearly a little starstruck, she hands Willy the note and he
dialog: surveys it.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: Mrs. Raoul Duval. Georgie Raoul Duval?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Oh... wonderful!.. Please go tell
dialog: your mistress we accept her
dialog: invitation and look forward to her
dialog: delightful company.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: I will!
dialog: And off she goes.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Who is she?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: ..-An American - a wayward
dialog: debutante from Louisiana... she
dialog: married a munitions magnate three
dialog: times her age.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: They sound a bit dull.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: He is. She is anything but.
dialog: (glances at her)
dialog: We don’t have to...
dialog: 93
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 57.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No. Let’s go...
scene_heading: INT. CAFE NOIR - EVENING 93
text: In the high ceilinged cafe, we follow a WAITER who drops a
text: bill off at a table where Georgie and Colette are in fits of
text: hysterics - the kind of laughter sustained by the seriously
text: drunk and flirtatious. Willy is providing the after-dinner
text: entertainment. Lily sits by them, awed at getting to spend
text: time with such celebrities, autograph book at the ready.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (almost crying with
dialog: laughter)
dialog: That’s so funny. Did he really say that?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Oh yes - he would. He is such a
dialog: colossal snob.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Then Mme de Caillavet happened to
dialog: mention that he was only a baron
dialog: and not a Marquise. “Allow me, he
dialog: said “I am also Duke of Anjou,
dialog: Bishop of Coutances, Prince of
dialog: Joinville, of Asturias, of Orléans
dialog: and the Dunes. But all that isn't
dialog: of the slightest importance...
dialog: (with perfect timing)
dialog: ..-here.”
text: Everyone howls with laughter. A stray curl of her hair
text: falls down over Georgie’s face.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Wait a moment.
text: Colette takes the lock and tries to pat it back into place.
text: A moment of electricity passes between the two. Willy
text: watches fascinated.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Hold still. That’s it.
text: She takes her hands away. The disobedient lock immediately
text: falls back down. The women lose it.
text: The waiter comes back by the table.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (paying the bill)
dialog: Here you are.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 58.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Thank you, Monsieur Willy.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Is the evening over already? I
dialog: can’t bear it...
dialog: (turning to her assistant)
dialog: Lily, go tell the coachman to ready
dialog: the carriage.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Of course...
text: Lily doesn’t get up though.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Well..?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I’m sorry Ma’am but...
dialog: (thrusting an autograph
dialog: book forward)
dialog: M. Willy, may I have your autograph..?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Of course! My pleasure. I’1l even
dialog: do you a doodle. Of me.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Oh thank you!
text: He hands it back. Georgie looks impatient.
speaker_heading: LILY (CONT'D)
dialog: And yours too Madame Colette.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Oh come now...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Not at all. Spirit should always
dialog: be rewarded.
text: She returns the book to Lily who positively vibrates with
dialog: excitement.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Good night, my dear.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Good night!
text: She hurries off.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 59.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Well... I live at 74 Rue Goethe. If you’d
dialog: like to stop by for at nightcap...
text: The question hangs in the air.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Thank you so much. But I feel like I
dialog: will retire this evening.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Are you sure now?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy...
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We'll play again soon, my dear.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Yes...I hope so. Before my bore of
dialog: a husband returns. Well adieu!
dialog: And she’s gone. Willy weighs this.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You don’t want to go?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The invitation was clearly for
dialog: you.
dialog: This really lands for Colette.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: ++. Should I?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes, of course.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You don’t mind?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'd be a hypocrite if I did,
dialog: wouldn't I?
dialog: Colette considers this.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: If it’s any comfort to you, I will be
text: at home lying in bed, thinking of the
dialog: two of you in the fondest way possible.
dialog: 94
dialog: 95
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 60.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGIE’S BUILDING - STAIRCASE - NIGHT 94
text: Colette slowly ascends the dark staircase. Hiding her
text: nervousness and her excitement. She knocks on the door. After
text: a moment’s waiting Georgie answers.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Come in.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 95
text: Georgie’s apartment, naturally, is very stylish.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What a nice place.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Thank you. This is my little pied-a-tere.
dialog: Frederick is not so keen on the Art Nouveau
dialog: pieces. But I love nature...and women.
text: Colette looks at a painting of nymphs bathing.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I can see that.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I remember in Claudine At School when the
dialog: girls go swimming together at night...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Night is the best time to swim.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: When I was a girl, I was told all
dialog: the lakes in Louisiana have
dialog: alligators. So I never went for a
dialog: midnight swim but I regret it...
text: Georgie looks down then raises her eyes towards Colette.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: When you raise your eyelids, it’s as
dialog: if you were taking off all my clothes.
text: Georgie looks down, blushing.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t look away. Look at me. Look
dialog: at me looking at you.
text: She does. It’s electric. Colette slowly moves in and
text: kisses her for a long hot moment.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 61.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: You have the most beautiful teeth.
text: She indicates Colette’s slightly angled front canine.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
text: Like an alligator.
text: They smile and kiss again.
scene_heading: 96 INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - MORNING 96
text: Willy is perusing the morning mail. He hears the sound of Colette
text: entering and, affecting nonchalance, carries on reading.
text: Colette enters, also acting cool.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: My dear...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Have you fed Toby Chien?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I forgot. I thought Matilde does it.
text: She heads down the hallway towards the kitchen. He stops her
text: with a question.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: How was last night?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It was..interesting.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What do you think happened?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Ah... well don’t tell me. I‘11 wait
dialog: to read about it. When Claudine
dialog: develops tender feelings towards a
dialog: lady friend.
text: Colette rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I won’t be writing it down.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: But you must... It’s prime material!

speaker_heading: 97a
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 62.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No!
text: She heads out.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Will you see her again?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Probably.
text: Willy is somewhat unsettled by his wife’s casualness and...
dialog: independence.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGIE’S APARTMENT - DAY 97
text: As Georgie is finishing up her morning toilet, there’s the
text: ring of a doorbell.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (murmurs )
dialog: One moment, my darling.
text: She hastily wraps herself in a gown and makes her way through
dialog: the apartment.
text: As she opens the door she is taken a back to see the bald
dialog: pate of Monsieur Willy.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Wonderful, you’re here.. I was just
dialog: passing by...
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Yes...
text: He continues to stare at her. She flushes slightly.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Well -
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: You'd better come in.

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Slow...painful... How was your
dialog: meeting with the bank?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Good... yes, it was good. I won't
dialog: bore you with the details.
text: He heads off. She continues writing.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGIE’S STREET - AFTERNOON 98
text: MUSIC COMES UP. A carriage pulls up outside the beautiful

scene_heading: INT. GEORGIE’S BUILDING - STAIRCASE - DAY 99
text: Colette approaches the door and knocks.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Is she in?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes, please come in.
text: Lily leaves as Colette enters. Inside, Colette turns towards
dialog: Georgie’s bedroom.
speaker_heading: LILY (CONT'D)
dialog: She’s expecting you.
text: Lily gives Colette a smile and leaves discreetly.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGIE’S STREET - EVENING 100
text: A carriage pulls up - but this time it’s Willy who gets
dialog: out.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGIE’S BUILDING - STAIRCASE - EVENING 101
text: Willy approaches the door. Georgie opens it. He takes off

scene_heading: INT. GEORGIE’S APARTMENT - DAY 102

scene_heading: INT. GEORGIE’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 103b
text: Georgie and Willy come to climax.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGIE’S STREET - AFTERNOON 104
text: Colette walks down the street looks up at the apartment.
text: Someone who looks suspiciously like Willy is at the window.
scene_heading: INT. GEORGIE’S BUILDING - STAIRCASE - AFTERNOON 105
text: Colette marches up the stairs, rings the bell.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Georgie! I know you’re in there.
text: Still no answer. Colette knocks hard on the door.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: Georgie. Open up!
text: More loud knocks. Eventually Georgie answers in a
dialog: nightgown.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Colette, I was taking a nap.
text: Colette pushes past her.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Who’s been in here?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: No one. What are you doing?
text: Colette looks to the bedroom where tell-tale cigar smoke
text: hangs in layers.
scene_heading: INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - STUDY - DAY 106
text: Colette is writing at her desk.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (V.O.)
text: Blue cigar smoke feted the air...
text: (she pauses, crosses out,
dialog: then continues)
dialog: I marched in and looked straight in the
text: face of the Renaud. He recoiled, saying,
dialog: “It was wicked of me. I’m sorry.”
dialog: 107
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 65.
text: Colette looks at the statue of Willy on her desk,
dialog: wistfully.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (V.O.)
dialog: Rezi was there, of course she was
dialog: there - covering herself up...
scene_heading: INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT 107
text: Colette and Willy’s voices merge as the story transfers
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: ..-I shall always remember her lily
text: white face decomposing, as if it were
text: dying right under my gaze.
text: Once again at the desk under the circle of light, Willy is
text: reading aloud from the notebooks, giving his customary
text: polish to the latest Claudine. Colette sits quietly by as
text: this chapter of their own lives is read. But she has more
text: confidence now - more poise. She is growing into herself.
text: He sets the book down. A moment’s thought.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s good.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I'd suggest you change the line when
dialog: Renaud says, “It was wicked of me to
dialog: do it.” But I know that you won’t.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (piqued)
dialog: What do you think Renaud would
dialog: say, in those circumstances?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Hmmm...something like, “Why...we
dialog: were waiting for you, my dear.”
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I don’t think she would believe him.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Of course not.
dialog: This is a sore point.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 66.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: But don’t you think she’s being
dialog: hypocritical - I mean, it’s acceptable
dialog: for Claudine to sleep with Rezi but
dialog: she doesn’t want Renaud to do the
dialog: same?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Not behind her back, no. The betrayal
dialog: came when Renaud lied to her. Renaud
dialog: who swore he would always be honest.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Perhaps he wanted to tell her, but he
dialog: was frightened of her terrible
dialog: jealousy?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Then he was a coward as well as a
dialog: liar.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You’re very harsh on him.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Who else will be? And Renaud would
dialog: never be jealous? If for instance,
text: Claudine went off with.. A young
dialog: man, for a change?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: He would find that unacceptable.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Infidelity, for Renaud is a matter
dialog: of gender.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It is...
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: How long have you known..?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: For a month or so.
text: Colette has won this one. Willy clears his throat.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Well I must say, I’m impressed with the
dialog: way you’ve handled yourself. The
dialog: younger Claudine would have thrown a
dialog: fit.
dialog: 108
dialog: 109
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 67.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I’m planning on killing Renaud off

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No - you can’t. Please.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (quoting Willy)
text: “The hand that holds the pen writes
dialog: history.”
text: Willy shoots her an amused but slightly threatened look.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Renaud’s moral shadings aside, the
dialog: writing is very good. Quite a work
dialog: of art. Those little scratches you
dialog: make on the paper -
dialog: (he indicates)
dialog: - very powerful. And it will have a
dialog: powerful effect. Everyone will immediately
dialog: know whom it’s about, there will be a huge
dialog: scandal, the books will spread like
dialog: thistledown all over France.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: And M. Willy will have yet another
text: hot book on his hands.
text: An uneasy truce has been declared.
speaker_heading: WILLY (cont'd)
dialog: You know what? I’m tempted to go
dialog: back and put even more Georgie into
dialog: Rezi.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy, we have to draw the line
dialog: somewhere.
speaker_heading: WILLY

speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: My husband - he’s just...pure rage. He

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I’ve put him off. Hopefully it
dialog: won’t come to that.
dialog: (she looks at Colette)
dialog: You've read it, yes?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I have.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: How worried should I be?
text: Georgie walks across to her with the drink.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: The names have all been changed.
dialog: It’s not blatantly obvious who is
dialog: who...
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I don’t believe you. Everyone is
dialog: chattering about it - saying it
dialog: will be salacious in the extreme.
dialog: (She clears her throat)
dialog: I know you have no time for me since our
dialog: separation and I know I behaved badly.
dialog: But I’m begging you... Ask Willy to
dialog: change it - before publication?
text: Colette slowly shakes her head.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Please Colette... One woman to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No, I can’t.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It’s not just Willy, Georgie,

text: Georgie downs her drink and switches gears - no more tears,
text: a hardness comes to her eyes.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: You had your chance to be decent. So,
dialog: it will be left to my husband to settle
dialog: it.
dialog: Ollendorff has agreed to a lump sum for
dialog: the destruction of the entire print
dialog: run.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What? You can’t do that.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: He has already accepted.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: The sly bastard. You can’t. You just
dialog: can’t.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: We have. And that is how it is.

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Like a true French heroine, our
text: daughter was burnt at the stake.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I said it would be a “hot book.”
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: The thing is though, Ollendorff signed
dialog: the deal but unfortunately failed to
dialog: mention...
dialog: (drum rolls the table...)
dialog: That he didn’t own the copyright. I
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: Unbelievable!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: All I had to do was trot round to
dialog: another publisher and collect a second

dialog: we speak.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: How do you two do it?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I think we got very lucky...
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Not at all! That American tart
dialog: and her senile lackey didn’t stand
dialog: a chance. We are with the times!
dialog: The wind is under our wings! And I
dialog: have a little plan that will make
dialog: Claudine the most popular girl in
dialog: France, if not the entire world.
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: With the play?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Not just that. We’1ll have Claudine

text: Colette and Willy are sitting in the tenth row of the theatre.
text: In front of them are the DIRECTOR and two FINANCIERS.
text: Colette, now in her late twenties, seems to have grown
text: comfortable in her skin. Willy, on the other hand, is showing
text: the tell-tale signs of a life too-well lived.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: She’s not bad.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: She’s terrible.
speaker_heading: INSIPID ACTRESS
dialog: Montigny is a village, not a town:
dialog: its streets, thank heaven, are not
text: paved; the showers roll down them
text: in little torrents that dry up in
dialog: a couple hours; it is a village,
dialog: not even a very pretty village,
dialog: but, all the same, I adore it.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (to Colette)
dialog: Yes, you’re right.
dialog: (shouts )
dialog: Thank you very much. Next.
text: A SECOND ACTRESS comes up on stage and starts repeating the
text: line. Colette notices the impressive hourglass silhouette
text: of a woman in the rear doorway.
text: The woman marches down the aisle and plants herself in
text: front of them. Wearing a schoolgirl smock, she is vibrant,
text: Algerian, with bobbed hair and a tiny waist. This is
speaker_heading: POLAIRE.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 72.
speaker_heading: POLAIRE
dialog: M. Willy. I am the real Claudine!
text: Colette and Willy exchange an intrigued look.

dialog: Me? My name is...Polaire!
scene_heading: 115 INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 115
text: Colette and Willy sit, examining photographs of Polaire.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Polaire! Polaire! Daughter of the
dialog: desert. Look at her! Look at her! She
dialog: knows the role instinctively.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: She talks about the book as though
dialog: it were a religion.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: A “Sister of Perpetual Claudine.”
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It’s interesting. She’s started to copy
dialog: little gestures and mannerisms that I do.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Do you think I could act?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You? No. It would be a criminal waste.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Waste of what?
text: Willy shrugs, dismissing the thought. He picks up a photo
text: and examines it closer.
speaker_heading: WILLY (cont'd)
dialog: That bobbed hair... I’ve never seen
dialog: anything like it. Have you?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: I always imagined Claudine had
dialog: long hair.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 73.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: That was the 19th Century
dialog: Claudine...this is now.
text: He holds the picture up beside her.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Would look good on you, actually. Very
text: fetching.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No. Willy, I couldn't.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It would make you look younger.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You’re turning thirty soon - what
dialog: better time to turn the clocks...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Thank you... But I’ve always had my
dialog: hair... Sido would kill me.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Just think of it... You and Polaire
dialog: - The Claudine Twins!
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It’ll be a goldmine of publicity.
dialog: All Paris will be atwitter.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No! Never... in a thousand years.
scene_heading: 116 INT. HAIR SALON — DAY 116

scene_heading: 117 INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM — EVENING&G7
text: Colette enters the room shorn. The haircut looks awkward -
text: it hasn’t quite settled in yet. Willy looks up from his
text: newspaper and stares at her amazed.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 74.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: My word! Where have you gone?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy, I hate it.
text: Willy circles his strange new wife.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: No... I like it very much.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It’s absurd. My head looks too big
dialog: for my body.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It’ll just take a bit of getting
dialog: used to...
text: Colette goes to a mirror.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Oh — what did I do?
text: Colette covers her face with her hands. She starts to
text: hyperventilate, holding back sobs.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: She butchered me. I look ten years
dialog: older. You made me do this.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Oh come now, you went along with it...
dialog: you always do.
text: Unexpectedly, she flies at him. He holds her arms away from
text: his chest. As they struggle -
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You bastard! Look at me...and all
dialog: for your damned publicity?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Gabrielle!
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You crowd-pleaser! You cheap

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I thought of all my novels, this was
dialog: the one that would translate to

scene_heading: MME. DE CAILLAVET

speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: Can you believe this crowd?
dialog: Everyone’s here! Look there’s the

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: A woman?
speaker_heading: SCHWOB
dialog: Descended from Empress Josephine
text: on one side, the Tsar of Russia on
dialog: the other - She only shows up for
dialog: very special occasions.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
text: Fascinating.
text: The moment is interrupted by a hubbub. Colette looks around
text: the corner where Polaire is making her entrance carried
text: aloft on a litter by FOUR MUSCULAR GUYS. She is showered
dialog: with praise and flowers.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Polaire! Over here!
speaker_heading: POLAIRE

speaker_heading: MISSY

speaker_heading: WAGUE
dialog: We’re all bloody exhausted!
text: She snorts.
speaker_heading: WAGUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Have you got any kohl I could

speaker_heading: COLETTE

scene_heading: INT. MONTMARAULT THEATER - NIGHT 166
text: With the scene set for a peasant’s cottage, Colette is
text: flirting with a SECRET LOVER.
text: The AUDIENCE is not paying much attention - they are
text: drinking, talking, eating.
text: Wague, playing Colette’s husband, discovers them and has a
text: fit of jealous rage; he shoves Colette around, smashing
text: dishes and goes to attack the lover.
text: Colette pleads and tries to explain (silently, of course),
text: but Wague’s rage just builds. He goes to attack the lover
text: but Colette gets in between them.
text: Wague grabs her collar and TEARS IT ASUNDER REVEALING HER
text: BREAST. Shocked he prostrates himself on the stage as though
text: struck by lightning.
text: The audience is awestruck. Colette stands frozen in her pose
text: as the piano restarts. We see something in her expression -—
text: the exhilaration that comes with discovering a new source of
dialog: personal power.

scene_heading: INT. COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - WILLY’S STUDY - DAY167
text: Willy is looking helplessly through a stack of bills. He
text: looks like he’s recovering from a rough night.
text: Moments later, he is at his desk in front of a typewriter.
text: He cracks his knuckles and prepares to work. In front of
text: him is the GREAT BLANK PAGE.
text: He types “WHAT CLAUDINE DID NEXT.” Then, “A NOVEL BY WILLY”
text: But nothing will come. The page remains blank. He stares at
text: it with growing frustration.
text: He types a letter, the word “I.” Then dots. ..... I... I...
text: then just scrambles on the typewriter anything.
scene_heading: HJIDGJYGEBNFJH jhgiuyi8t/[108450io0df jnaf;knakgjhuyatuhrtka
text: He stops. Then...
scene_heading: KSJhdiuyrug jhabvdf jhqyt5pquojbf ’ auyt[ 085yioqhohhtuhwqout
text: He types faster and faster and faster and starts to bang
text: the keys - first with fingers then with his fists so that
text: he is likely to hurt himself. Then he stops, breathes and
text: almost at the point of tears, and looks desperately at a
text: picture of Colette on his desk.
scene_heading: INT. OLLENDORFF PUBLISHING — DAY 168
text: Willy walks slowly up the grand staircase.
scene_heading: INT. OLLENDORFF’S OFFICE - DAY 169
text: The men are seated on either side of Ollendorff'’s wide

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Tell me something...the sole rights to
dialog: the Claudines, Ollendorff... What would
dialog: you give me for them?
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: Are you serious? All of them?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Make me an offer.
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: How much are you thinking?
dialog: 170
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 105.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Let’s say 25,000. In a few years -
dialog: they’1l recoup ten times that.
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: Possibly...but I don’t have that much.
dialog: Publishing is a volatile business, Willy...
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: How much then?
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: ..-For the sole rights in
dialog: perpetuity?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes.
text: Ollendorff eyes him, calculating. He takes a small slip of
text: paper and scribbles a number on it and passes it over the
text: desk. Willy looks at it, dismayed.
scene_heading: INT. A BAR IN STRASBOURG - NIGHT 170
text: A warm crowded table in a lively low-roofed cellar filled
text: with life and music. Colette and BAPTISTE, a Vietnamese
text: conjurer, are having an arm wrestle across a table. Wague
text: with a YOUNG FLIRT, a RUSSIAN ACROBAT and some SHOWGIRLS
text: cheer Colette on. There is the feeling of merriment, of
text: circus. Colette almost loses then makes a final mighty push
text: to bring her opponent’s hand down. Cheers from the
dialog: assembled.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Did you let me win?
speaker_heading: BAPTISTE
dialog: Of course!
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Bastard! That’s worst than losing!
speaker_heading: ACROBAT

speaker_heading: BAPTISTE
dialog: No no. I have a great affection

scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 106.
text: Laughter. Across the room, Missy enters at the main door.
text: Wearing a SKIRT.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Missy! Missy!
text: Missy expertly detaches the skirt revealing trousers
text: underneath. Everybody cheers.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Hello, my love.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: I’m sorry the train was waiting

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Come here...next to me.
text: Missy snuggles on to the bench by Colette.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: How was it tonight?
speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: MISSY
text: The gang is in a good mood.
speaker_heading: BAPTISTE
dialog: Hey Missy, I’m going to the bar do you
dialog: want anything?-
speaker_heading: MISSY
text: Order champagne. Three bottles.
dialog: Make it five.

speaker_heading: FLOSSY
dialog: Santé, you beautiful gal.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Santé, Flossy. You’re the best.

scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 107.
text: Her friend, MOLLY, agrees. Colette’s eyes glow at this

speaker_heading: MISSY

speaker_heading: MISSY (CONT’D)
dialog: You don’t need to worry about
dialog: Willy. You don’t need to earn your
dialog: own money or stay in these kind of
dialog: places. I could arrange
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Too much of my life has been “arranged.”
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: I just want you to be able to
dialog: write if you want to.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I don’t want to. I’m happy. And I
dialog: like my threadbare lodgings...I
dialog: like making my own money. Even if
dialog: it’s only 50 francs a show.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 108.

speaker_heading: MISSY

speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: It’s not the traditional reply but

speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Get up. Now! We’re coming in.

speaker_heading: MANAGER'‘S WIFE
dialog: You see? I told you!

speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Please fuck off.
dialog: (alternate take)

scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 174

scene_heading: INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 175
text: The house has taken on a depressing air - pictures have

text: packaging up her collection of paperweights.
text: Across the room, Willy is packing up some bric-a-brac.
text: They work in silence, at opposite ends of a wide frame.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I’ve been thinking about this new craze
dialog: for moving pictures. Do you think we
dialog: could adapt Claudine for a cineplay..?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: (half to herself)
dialog: Do you never stop?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We could write a completely fresh
text: story. Claudine by the Sea.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No... Adapt the old ones...
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Perhaps...
text: There’s a flash of guilt in Willy’s eyes.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Catch!
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 110.
text: She throws the original Paris snow globe across to him. Half
text: the water has leaked out and it looks pretty deteriorated.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Oh yes! How sad.
text: Tears come to his eyes but she doesn’t see.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)
dialog: I’ve missed you.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No, you haven’t.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Of course I have... your ambiguous
dialog: smiles, the insane speed of your
dialog: thoughts, your absurd joys, your
text: brief but violent anger...
text: Colette is affected by this but won’t let it show. She
text: finishes up a crate and puts the lid on.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: How’s the book going with Meg..?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Terrible! All spice and no literature.
dialog: (Colette snorts a laugh)
dialog: She’s not you and she never will be.

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: What are we doing, Willy?
text: They look across to each other but the distance between

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: ...Are we finished?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I don’t know.
text: Willy sighs, wants to cry. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You can’t.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Why can’t I?
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 111.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Because I love you and you at your

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Am I?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yes, you know you are. But you still

speaker_heading: COLETTE

text: Willy enters, dressed in his nightshirt.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: May I get in with you, Gabri?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: - Yes. Get in.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I couldn’t sleep. It was too

dialog: (a quiet moment)
dialog: Listen. The silence. It’s
dialog: terrifying isn’t it?
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No...I love it.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Of course, you do - you country girl.
text: He kisses her on the cheek.
speaker_heading: WILLY (CONT’D)

scene_heading: INT. THEATRE - BACKSTAGE 178
text: The troupe descend a spiral staircase leading down from the

speaker_heading: FLOSSY
dialog: Went well tonight!

speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: Madame Willy.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Monsieur Ollendorff!
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: I'm here in Lille on some family

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: It’s kind of you to come and see it.
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: It was quite a spectacle.

speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF (cont'd) (CONT'D)
dialog: I was thinking, if you were free,
dialog: I would like to take you and the

scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 113.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Thank you. I’m always up for a free

dialog: company.
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: It’s the very least I can do for you,
dialog: Colette. After all the money you’ve
dialog: made for me. And will continue to make.
text: (he gives a tight-lipped smile)
dialog: I wish I had been able to give Willy
dialog: a better settlement. But one can
dialog: only pay what one can afford.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I’m not sure I quite understand.
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF
dialog: For the Claudines. For the rights
dialog: to the Claudines.
text: A STAGEHAND passes between them carrying a bunch of flowers
text: up the stairs.
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you mean to say he didn’t tell you?
text: Colette looks at him stunned.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Willy sold you the Claudines?
speaker_heading: OLLENDORFF

speaker_heading: COLETTE

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Ah... You've heard... Yes...
dialog: Well...I was in a corner.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Traitor. Liar. Thief.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Don’t be so melodramatic. I was
dialog: trying to keep the house for you.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I gave you the house!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We still owed the bank so much on
dialog: it.
scene_heading: COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 115.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You could have sold Veber’s
dialog: novels. Some of your other trash.
dialog: You only did it to stick the knife
dialog: in me. Didn’t you?! DIDN’T you?!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I wouldn’t have got anything for
dialog: Veber’s or Schwob’s or anyone
dialog: else’s. Please calm down...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Why? Why should I calm down? You hurt
dialog: and you hurt and you think that by
dialog: saying “I’m aman, that’s what men
dialog: do,” you clear it all away...
text: He reaches for her hand. She explodes, recoils as if at an
dialog: electric shock.
speaker_heading: COLETTE (CONT’D)
dialog: DON’T YOU TOUCH ME! What you did was
dialog: not just hateful - it was stupid. Now
dialog: we'll have no say over our books and
dialog: we'll never see another sou from them.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We can write some more...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: No! Never again! NEVER!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: My dear, you’re over-reacting. It
dialog: was purely a business decision.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: That’s what our whole marriage has
dialog: been! Wasn’t I the best investment
dialog: you ever made? No dowry but my
dialog: God, she can write for her keep?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: If you were an investment then you
dialog: were a highly speculative one. I
dialog: gave up my inheritance for you.
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: I paid you back a thousand times.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Colette stop, damn it!! Stop
dialog: talking about money. You were my

speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: You've killed our child.

speaker_heading: COLETTE (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: My dear, Claudine was only a...
speaker_heading: COLETTE
dialog: Don’t! Don’t tell me what Claudine
dialog: was. I am the real Claudine!!!
dialog: (he tries to interrupt)
dialog: Everything I thought and felt went
dialog: into those books. They were me. My
dialog: childhood, my memories, my opinions.
dialog: Everything. And then the hours and
dialog: hours I spent, alone, slaving away for
dialog: you. Churning out scenes just to try
dialog: and please you. I am so ashamed of
dialog: myself for that. But I knew and you
dialog: knew - that I was bound to do it.
dialog: (she shakes her head)
dialog: You found me when I knew nothing,
dialog: Willy. You molded me to your own
dialog: designs...to your desires. And you
dialog: thought I could never break free...
dialog: But you’re wrong. Claudine is dead
dialog: now. She’s gone. You betrayed her. And
dialog: I...I’ve outgrown her.
text: Willy sinks into a chair. He looks exhausted, deflated. He

dialog: She walks
speaker_heading: WILLY

text: He is thinking out loud to Heon...
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: You see - that’s mine, that’s mine -

dialog: hour.
