dialog: 
text: The events in this film are real.
dialog: Names and places have been changed to protect the Lorien Six,

dialog: Take this as your first warning. Other civilizations do exist.

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: A BILLION STARS
text: pinprick the velvet-black sky that stretches over a vast
text: sleeping jungle. A fingernail moon silvers the whispering
text: canopy while gentle tendrils of steam rise.
scene_heading: TITLE ON SCREEN: REPUBLIC OF CONGO, AFRICA.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
text: CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the eternity of treetops until it FINDS
text: A BUNGALOW.
text: It's 20x20 square, with a wraparound porch and simple wooden
text: shutters. The structure is hidden in a clearing that's been
text: crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness.
scene_heading: INT. HUT - NIGHT
text: Two beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the
text: space. A TEEN BOY sleeps in one and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN lies
text: in the other. Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat.
text: The numbing THROB OF INSECTS fills the silence until
text: THE DOOR SOFTLY RATTLES.
text: The Teen's eyes fly open. Fear grips his face as he looks
text: over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold
text: their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS.
scene_heading: ANOTHER RATTLE.
text: It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as
text: the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow
text: and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans
text: in and peers through the bamboo slats.
text: WHAT HE SEES: The empty porch. No sign of life.
text: Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his
text: face contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of
scene_heading: A SERRATED METAL BLADE
text: protruding from his chest. As the sword is viciously
text: protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted
text: eyes and whispers his last, desperate word...
speaker_heading: MIDDLE-AGED MAN
dialog: Run!
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
text: The Teen's naked feet pound the hot, wet earth as he sprints
text: through the maze of trees. Flecks of moonlight ricochet off
text: the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck. He moves
text: impossibly fast. Faster than any human could.
text: A MONSTROUS HOWL
text: ECHOES as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins
text: thrashing in pursuit. The Teen's face tightens with dread
text: and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears.
text: He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive. He races
text: up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of
scene_heading: A 100-FOOT-WIDE RAVINE!
text: GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as the Teen leaps across the abyss. He
text: kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite
text: lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of
text: A HULKING BEAST.
text: It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side.
text: It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of frustration. Relieved,
text: the Teen turns to make his escape when
speaker_heading: A HAND
text: wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly hoisted by a
text: TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster.
text: THIS IS A MOGADORIAN.
text: He wears the long red coat of a Commander. We catch the
text: briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the
text: geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant. Silhouetted
text: against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises
text: A SWORD.
text: Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps
text: towards the Teen. The boy's DEATH CRY echoes as the CAMERA
text: ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright.
speaker_heading: FORM CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE SAME SYMBOL.
text: It glimmers to life on the ankle of another TEEN 10,000 miles
text: away. His name's DANIEL and he's in the middle of a wild jet-
text: ski race with TWO BUDDIES.
scene_heading: TITLE ON SCREEN: BIG PINE KEY, FLORIDA, USA.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
text: The trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages
text: on the beach.
text: Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his
text: opponents and victoriously pumps his fist. But his moment of
text: triumph is cut short. His face contorts in agony as he feels
speaker_heading: THE SYMBOL
text: searing into his skin. As he leans forward to grip his
text: ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body-slams
text: across the water.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
text: LOOKING UP as Daniel crashes into view. Needles of light
text: flicker from the symbol. It's cauterizing into his flesh
text: like a brand.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
text: Daniel stumbles through the surf and collapses onto the sand,
text: clutching his ankle. He rolls onto his side as a CROWD OF
text: PARTYING TEENS gathers. A BLONDE GIRL leans down to help.
speaker_heading: BLONDE GIRL
dialog: Daniel, what's wrong? Did you
dialog: break your ankle?
text: But as she turns him over, she sees the light leaking from
text: between his fingers and reels back.
speaker_heading: BLONDE GIRL
dialog: Oh my God.
text: He stares up into the crowd's fearful faces, then staggers to
text: his feet and takes off running.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY
text: The busy road runs parallel to an expanse of ancient pines.
text: Through the trees, we CATCH THE SHUTTER IMAGE of a figure
text: outrunning the hurtling vehicles.
scene_heading: EXT. COASTAL FOREST - DAY
text: Trees whip past as Daniel sprints down a sandy track. The
text: pendant that knocks against his chest was carved by the same
text: hand as the African Teen's, but the symbol is unique. He
text: peels off to the right and bursts out onto a long drive.
scene_heading: A STILT HOUSE
text: sits at the end. It's cake-frosting pink and is built right
text: on the edge of a coral-white beach.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
scene_heading: EXT. STILT HOUSE - DAY
text: The door flies open and Daniel stands on the threshold.
text: HENRI looks up from his bank of laptops that scroll with news
text: feeds. He is decades older than his suntanned face betrays
dialog: and you'd be way off if you guessed his accent was French.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: Number 3 is dead.
text: Henri's eyes narrow with urgency. He is immediately on his
text: feet, he kneels at Daniel's side and studies the symbol on
text: the teen's ankle. It has stopped glowing but is painfully
text: raw. Directly below this fresh wound are
scene_heading: TWO OTHER GEOMETRIC BRANDS.
text: They are the same size, but each symbol is subtly different.
text: Time has transformed them into raised, snake-smooth scars.
text: Henri's penetrating eyes look up at the shell-shocked teen.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Did anybody else see this?
text: OFF Daniel's panicked nod...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - STILT HOUSE - DAY
speaker_heading: A GECKO
text: skitters across the ceiling, its glossy black eyes watch as
text: Daniel frantically stuffs his clothes into a duffel bag. The
text: walls are bare. No photos, no posters, no personality.
text: Henri enters, holding a crate of computer cables.
speaker_heading: HENRI
text: Taillights in five minutes. What
dialog: we can't carry --
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: -- we burn. I know the drill.
scene_heading: EXT. STILT HOUSE - DAY
text: TIGHT ON A BOX. It's exquisitely carved and inlaid with an
text: intricate geometric design.
text: Henri carefully hides it under the driver's seat of an old
text: Jeep Wagoneer. It's the kind with wooden trim. He looks at
text: Daniel who feeds homework assignments into a roaring FIRE.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Time to go.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
text: Daniel clicks the SIM card from his cell phone, snaps it in
text: two and drops it into the fire. Bitter, he takes one last
text: look at the glittering azure sea, then climbs into the Jeep.
text: As the engine HUMS to life, CAMERA FOLLOWS
speaker_heading: THE GECKO.
text: It darts up the fender, squeezes into the jamb of the trunk,
text: and Houdinis into the vehicle with a flick of its tail.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAUSEWAY - DUSK
text: The Jeep powers across the long elevated bridge. The dying
text: sun tints the clouds and the sky in violent apocalyptic hues.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: This is the part I hate the most.
dialog: The running. But it's the only
dialog: thing in my life that's real. The
dialog: rest is a lie. My name. My
dialog: birthday. Even Henri. People
dialog: think he's my father. He's not.
dialog: His job is to keep me alive.
scene_heading: INT. JEEP - NIGHT - MOVING
text: Henri's eyes scan the rear view, on constant vigil. The
text: speedometer never brushes past 60. Daniel has his head
text: against the window, brooding, listening to an iPod.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: We are hiding from the Mogadorians.
dialog: A brutal race that wiped out our
dialog: entire planet, Lorien.
scene_heading: EXT. USED-CAR LOT - DAY
text: Plastic flags whip overhead. Daniel leans against a silver
text: SUV and watches Henri negotiate with the DEALER.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: Only nine children escaped the
dialog: genocide. We were each given a
dialog: number and sent here to hide. I
dialog: don't know where the others are. I
dialog: only know when one of them is
dialog: murdered.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - MOTEL - NIGHT
text: Daniel sits on the edge of a bathtub. He gently unwraps the
text: bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat
text: scab that has formed over the wound.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: I got the first scar when I was
dialog: eight. I woke up screaming. We
dialog: lived in Vermont. The second was
text: on a Tilt-a-Whirl at a fair in
dialog: Michigan. I was 12. Yesterday was
dialog: the third.
text: His finger traces the lines of the other two scars.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY
text: The lush tropical landscape has browned into flat, dormant
text: farmland. The silver SUV charges through the bleak monotony.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: Because of the spell our Elders
dialog: cast, the Mogs can only kill us in
dialog: order. That's the reason I've
dialog: survived this long. But our enemy
dialog: is relentless.
scene_heading: INT. SUV - NIGHT - MOVING
text: Daniel is asleep with his earphones on. Henri glances over,
text: his mask of certainty momentarily slips. He looks like a
text: soldier heading into a battle he knows cannot be won.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: Now their hunt has turned to me. I
dialog: am number 4.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. REST-STOP DINER - NIGHT
text: A tired neon sign illuminates the big rigs that RUMBLE past,
text: headed to destinations unknown.
scene_heading: INT. REST-STOP DINER - NIGHT
text: Daniel sullenly stares at a stack of untouched pancakes.
text: Henri slides into the booth, all business.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Florida's clear. I sent a letter
dialog: to the school and there's nothing
dialog: in the papers.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I didn't even get a chance to say
dialog: goodbye.
text: Henri keeps going, passes an envelope across the table.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: New IDs.
text: Daniel pulls out his birth certificate, reads the name.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Just when I think you can't get any
dialog: less original, you lower the bar.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I'm not interested in originality.
dialog: I'm interested in untraceable.
dialog: There are 335,321 John Smiths in
dialog: the United States.
dialog: (Note: from this point on, Daniel will be called John.)
text: John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away.
text: Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him.
scene_heading: INT. ARCADE - REST STOP - NIGHT
text: A row of ancient arcade games blinks. John angrily stabs the
text: buttons of a Space Invaders machine as Henri approaches.
text: They are alone. John's eyes never leave the video screen.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's been so long since the last
dialog: scar.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You got lulled into a false sense
dialog: of security. That's my fault.
text: John struggles to keep his temper in check.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I liked Florida. I liked having
dialog: friends. I liked feeling normal.
text: Henri's face softens with paternal compassion.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I wish that you could have a normal
dialog: life -- but you can't.
text: Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with
dialog: frustration.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Then why fake it? Why not just go
text: hole up in the wilderness.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: That's exactly what Number 3 did.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
text: John looks at him, confused. Henri pulls up an article on
text: his iPhone and hands it to John.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: It's from an African news site. A
dialog: man and his son went missing two
dialog: nights ago. The locals think they
text: were taken by strange beasts.
text: John understands the implication.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Piken.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: The Mogadorians are natural-born
dialog: hunters. Blending in is our best
dialog: protection.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So we just keep moving from town to
dialog: town?
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Until I say otherwise -- yes.
text: John waits as a TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice
text: softens but never loses its intensity.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I want to be from someplace, Henri.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You are.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Lorien's your home, I don't even
dialog: remember it.
text: John's tone rubs Henri the wrong way.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Like it or not, it's your home too.
dialog: You have a responsibility to those
dialog: who died.
scene_heading: INT. SUV - NIGHT
text: Henri and John climb in.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I want a say in where we live.
dialog: (off Henri's face)
dialog: You already picked it, didn't you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
text: Henri REVS the ENGINE to life.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Cheer up, you're going to be living
dialog: in Paradise.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A frigid sheet of RAIN POUNDS the sign that's planted on the
text: side of this narrow stretch of rural blacktop:
scene_heading: âWELCOME TO PARADISE, OHIO. POP. 5,243â
text: The silver SUV streaks past, its wipers working overtime. It
text: kicks up a spray as it speeds down Main Street. The dinky
text: storefronts are garishly decorated for Halloween.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: The leaves are washed in a thousand shades of gold. The SUV
text: barrels along the drive that twists through the woods.
scene_heading: INT. SUV - DAY - DRIVING
text: Henri pulls up in front of a small house. It sits by itself,
text: surrounded by trees. Water sluices off the weather-worn
text: garage in the yard behind it. A WOMAN steps out of a minivan
text: to greet them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: She looks even perkier than the
dialog: realtor in Florida.
text: A warm smile graces her round face and she's clutching a
text: fruit basket. For the record, she is called ANNIE.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: John Smith.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Where are you from, John?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Arizona.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Why did you move to Paradise?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Because you're an asshole.
text: John waits for a reaction but doesn't get one...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Because my dad needs peace and
text: quiet to research his book.
text: Henri nods and smiles wryly.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: This was a lot easier when you were
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
text: The front door swings open and Annie proudly escorts Henri
text: and John inside.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Here we are. Home sweet home.
text: They scan the faded interior. The place is in desperate need
text: of a makeover. A grandfather clock pensively TICKS at the
text: end of the hall. Annie remains relentlessly optimistic.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: First impressions?
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: It's perfect.
text: Annie places the fruit basket on the dining table and begins
text: turning on the lights.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That's one word for it.
text: Stewing, John exits into the hall with his duffel bag. Annie
dialog: reads the strained dynamic.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I feel your pain. I have a
dialog: daughter his age. Apparently, I
dialog: ruin her life on a daily basis.
text: John steps back in, holding a sun-faded poster featuring NFL
dialog: great Bernie Kosar.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This guy was covering a hole in my
dialog: wall.
text: Annie's cheeks blush with annoyance.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I told the handyman to patch that
dialog: before you arrived. I'm so sorry.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
text: Henri is all charm, gently leads her to the front door.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Don't you worry about it.
text: She nods, grateful.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We'll knock it off the rent. Keep
dialog: the poster, Bernie Kosar brings
dialog: good luck here in the Buckeye
dialog: State.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The rain has stopped. The wind RUSTLES the trees. John
text: lifts out the last box. As he closes the trunk, he doesn't
text: notice the hitchhiking gecko hotfoot it out.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Henri is busy setting up his computer station. John dumps
text: the box on the floor.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That's the last of them. I'm
text: hitting the sack.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I need a new photo first.
text: John crosses and stands against the wall.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Say Paradise.
text: John gives him a withering look. Henri flashes off a shot.
text: The camera is cabled to one of the laptops.
text: TIGHT ON LAPTOP: The image of John pixelates onto a digital
text: grid and a face-recognition program begins to map his facial
dialog: structure.
text: Henri turns to another laptop.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I've imputed the new search words:
dialog: Daniel Jones. Big Pine Key.
dialog: Sunset High School. You think of
dialog: any others?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah, this place sucks.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
text: Henri swivels to face him.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: If there's a story or picture of
dialog: you on the internet, this program
dialog: will find it. Our enemy doesn't
dialog: know who you are -- I want to keep
dialog: it that way.
text: John nods, knows he's being a jerk.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sand Dollar Beach, that's where we
dialog: were jet skiing.
text: Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door.
text: Their heads instantly turn towards the sound. Tense SILENCE.
text: SLOW PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes.
text: Henri is on his feet. He flicks off the lights and silently
text: signals John to retreat down the hall. With the cool air of
text: an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek
text: crystal-handled dagger. As he steps to the door...
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: ... John crouches in the dark, clutching a baseball bat.
text: Suddenly, the light in the bedroom buzzes back on. He holds
text: his breath as the door swings open. He looks up and is
text: relieved to see Henri.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I found our intruder -- he's a
dialog: little small for a Mogadorian.
dialog: At that moment,
speaker_heading: A BEAGLE
text: slips between Henri's legs. It cocks its head, studies
text: John's face, then pads forward and licks his cheek.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The dog greedily laps a bowl of milk.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He's starving, doesn't have any
dialog: collar or tags.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Must have been dumped.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You know, another pair of eyes and
dialog: ears watching the house wouldn't be
dialog: a bad thing.
text: Henri considers the request, nods. John playfully ruffles
text: the dog's head.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: What are you going to call him?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Since I need all the luck I can get
dialog: -- how about Bernie Kosar?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - MORNING
text: John enters, dressed in black, ready for his first day of
text: school. He dumps his backpack on a chair. Henri places a
text: plate with an omelette and perfectly browned hash browns in
text: front of him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Wow. You outdid yourself. What's
dialog: up?
text: Henri lifts a red backpack into view. John stares at it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I already have a backpack.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: This one has five days of rations,
text: spare clothes, cash and a handheld
dialog: GPS. Keep it with you at all
dialog: times.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Henri, come on.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Game's changed. You're in the
dialog: crosshairs now. You have to be
dialog: ready to leave at a moment's
dialog: notice. With or without me.
text: John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality. He
text: pushes the plate away, snatches the backpack and heads out
text: the door. Henri stares at the omelette, tastes a pinch of
text: hash browns, then puts the plate on the floor on his way out.
text: It takes Bernie 2.5 seconds to race over and start to eat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
text: Jack-o'-lanterns stare out from the âHALLOWEEN BLOCK PARTYâ
text: banner strung across the red brick facade. Henri drives
text: away. John slides the red backpack onto his shoulder when he
text: hears a FAMILIAR BARK. He turns and is surprised to find
scene_heading: BERNIE KOSAR.
text: The little dog is sitting by the flagpole wagging his white-
text: tipped tail. John crosses to him, baffled.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Bernie, what the hell... were you
dialog: hiding in the car?
text: He scoops the dog into his arms.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, I was about to take a picture
dialog: of the little guy.
text: John turns and finds
speaker_heading: SARAH HARTE.
text: She's his age and is holding an old 35mm Nikon. There is
text: something about her unforced beauty that is instantly
text: enchanting. John shuffles, uncharacteristically nervous.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He's not supposed to be here.
speaker_heading: (TO BERNIE)
dialog: Go home. Now.
text: Bernie hops out of his arms and obediently runs towards home.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: He's really well-trained. How long
dialog: have you had him?
text: John turns away.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sorry about your shot.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No worries.
text: He begins walking towards the entrance.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You just moved into the house on
dialog: Old Mill Road. It's John, right?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
text: John swings back, concerned.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don't worry, I'm not stalking you.
dialog: My mom said she rented it to a guy
dialog: with a son my age. Since I know
dialog: every other face on this quad, that
dialog: had to be you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm Sarah.
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Where are you from?
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: Someplace warmer.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don't think that qualifies as an
dialog: actual answer.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I need to register.
text: She raises her camera to snap a shot of him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Whoa. What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Capturing your first day, even
dialog: though you're technically six weeks
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Please don't point that at me.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Afraid the camera's going to steal
dialog: your soul?
text: She lifts the viewfinder to her eye, adjusts focus. Annoyed,
text: he covers the lens with his hand.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What's your problem? I said no.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's only for the yearbook.
text: John regains his composure.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm not big into having my picture
dialog: taken. Sorry.
text: As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued. CAMERA TRACKS TO
text: REVEAL MARK JAYNE monitoring the encounter. He's the star
text: quarterback and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
text: Loaded with textbooks, John instinctively bows his head as he
text: passes the black eye of a hall security camera and steps to a
text: locker. He reaches for the combination lock when
speaker_heading: A BACKPACK
text: viciously sideswipes him. The textbooks scatter across the
text: checkerboard linoleum. John sees the culprit is Mark Jayne,
text: who offers him a taunting grin. John fights his urge to
text: react and watches as Mark struts over to his POSSE OF JOCKS.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Welcome to Paradise, irony not
dialog: included.
text: John looks at the teen standing two lockers down. He's got a
text: battered skateboard tucked into his backpack and wears an
dialog: Army surplus jacket. This is SAM GOODE -- genius by birth,
text: slacker by choice. He nods after Mark.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: His name's Mark Jayne.
dialog: Quarterback, sheriff's son, he's
dialog: three years into the best four
dialog: years of his life.
text: John begins retrieving the fallen books. Sam helps.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do yourself a favor -- stay off his
dialog: radar.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Didn't know I was on it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You were talking to Sarah Harte.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: She was talking to me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mark and Sarah have been exclusive
dialog: since Freshmen year.

text: Sarah's shoulder.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: If there's another guy in her
dialog: airspace, he shoots them down. You
dialog: got a warning shot.
text: John piles the books into his locker.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Maybe I'll fire back next time.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look, you're new, so let me tell
dialog: you how things work in this
dialog: misnamed backwater. Football
dialog: players are gods -- the rest of us
dialog: are mere mortals. If you want to
dialog: survive, keep your head down and
dialog: don't make waves.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You sound like my dad.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Obviously a wise man.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm Sam by the way.
text: Sam extends his hand. John doesn't take it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Thanks for the download.
text: As he SLAMS his locker shut...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY
text: It's an impressive structure with wraparound bleachers. The
text: Junior gym class jogs around the track. John hangs in the
text: middle of the pack, with his hoodie up, blending in.
text: They pass the GIRLS who are stretching on the pristine field.
text: Sarah's eyes drift towards John. The COACH blows a whistle.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: Alright, people. Let's hit the
dialog: gym.
text: The assembled teens GROAN and fan off towards the mouth of a
text: tunnel that stares out from the base of the bleachers.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
scene_heading: INT. GYM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY
text: John emerges from the tunnel via a door by the stage. Some
text: of his classmates are on the court, passing and dribbling.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: Okay, half court, three on three.
dialog: Girls have this basket, boys have
dialog: that one.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Two simultaneous games are in progress. John sits on the
text: sidelines waiting his turn. He avoids eye contact with Sarah
text: who is sitting in the shadow of the basket. However, he does
text: notice Mark Jayne enter and approach her.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: New kid, you're up. Show me what
dialog: you've got.
text: John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his
text: way. He steals a glance and sees Sarah and Mark arguing. A
text: blur of orange. John swings back and catches the ball.
text: Just as he shoots, he's distracted by Sarah's upset voice.
speaker_heading: THE SHOT
text: goes wild, misses the basket but hits the glass backboard
dialog: with such force that it
speaker_heading: SHATTERS.
text: Mark and Sarah are inadvertently forced to separate as shards
text: rain down. All eyes turn to John, who's annoyed at his
text: momentary lapse. TEENS HOOT. The Coach BLOWS his whistle.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: Enough! Hit the showers.
speaker_heading: (TO JOHN)
text: LeBron, grab a broom.
text: As the gym empties, John looks over and catches Sarah
text: watching him. OFF this silent exchange...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
scene_heading: THE INTRICATELY CARVED BOX
text: is clutched in Henri's hands. He heads down the hall and
text: stops in front of the grandfather clock. Its tarnished
text: pendulum sways. He unlocks the glass panel and slots the Box
text: out of sight behind the clock's brass face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
text: Satisfied with the hiding place, he locks the front and takes
text: the key. When he turns back, he finds
scene_heading: BERNIE KOSAR.
text: The dog is studying him with his head cocked.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Let's keep this our little secret.
text: OFF Bernie's inquisitive eyes...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - DAY
text: John joins the line. He sees Sarah sitting by herself,
text: inspecting a photographic contact sheet. His view is blocked
text: by Sam. John rubs his hands which are oddly sweaty.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: First day here and you're already
dialog: destroying school property. So
dialog: much for not making waves.
text: John moves past him and grabs a tray. He's flushed and his
text: face is now hot and red.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It was an accident.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I hear the real spectator sport was
text: Mark and Sarah's blowout.
text: John wipes his brow, distracted.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dude, you okay?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Fine.
text: At that moment, Mark Jayne and his buddy, KEVIN, cut in front
text: of them. Annoyed, John taps Mark on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You got a problem?
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: Line starts back there.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Football players get priority.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where's that posted?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Unwritten rule.
speaker_heading: (RE: SAM)
dialog: I'm surprised your boyfriend didn't
dialog: tell you.
text: Sam puts his hands up and backs away. Mark smirks at John.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: If you don't know your place around
dialog: here, things can get rough.
text: John holds his ground.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: In that case, I guess I better ask
dialog: you where I should sit. I was
dialog: thinking about grabbing that chair
dialog: next to your girlfriend.
text: In a flash of anger, Mark whips up his tray, hammers it into
text: John's chest, knocking him to the floor.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You want to talk trash? Let's see
dialog: you back it up.
text: John tries to stand, but is suddenly overcome with a wave of
text: pain. He looks down at his hands and is alarmed to see
speaker_heading: LIGHT
text: blooming from his palms! He quickly balls them into fists,
text: extinguishing the light from view.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Get up!
text: SILENCE has fallen. Still clenching his fists, John rises
text: and stumbles out into the hall. OFF Sarah's concern as she
text: watches him exit...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - HOUSE - DAY
text: Henri is on a ladder, adjusting a hidden surveillance camera
text: above the front door, when Bernie starts BARKING. It's an
text: anxious, urgent BARK.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
text: Henri steps inside and sees the dog is BARKING at --
text: THE GRANDFATHER CLOCK.
text: A shaft of white light blooms from within. The shadow of the
text: swaying pendulum cuts across Henri's face. As he sprints for
dialog: the door...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY
text: Disoriented, John staggers down the hall. Sam catches up.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dude, hold up!
text: John leans against the wall, keeping his hands out of sight.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You look like crap. I'll get the
dialog: nurse.
text: But as Sam runs off, John heads in the other direction.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY
text: Henri's SUV roars into view, whipping up a tornado of leaves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY
text: Strips of negatives hang on drying lines. John bursts in and
text: SLAMS the door. He slips off his backpack, opens his hands.
text: TIGHT ON HIS EYES -- the brilliant light from his palms
text: shrinks his irises to pinpricks.
text: The luminescence is crisp, mercury-glass bright and grows
text: stronger every second. Suddenly, the door opens. John spins
text: in shock. A figure strides through the blinding glare,
text: gently takes his hands and folds them into fists.
text: IT'S HENRI.
text: John looks at him, confusion and fear etched on his face.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Henri, what's happening to me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Calm down. You're going to be
dialog: okay.
text: John angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: On what planet is this okay?
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Yours.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I need to get you out of here.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY
text: John steps out of the darkroom wearing Henri's heavy coat.
text: His hands are balled and stuffed into the pockets. Henri
text: leads him quickly down the hall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SUV - DAY - MOVING
text: John fearfully studies his hands which have returned to
text: normal, then looks over at Henri who seems oddly calm.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Okay, start talking. What the
dialog: hell's going on?
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Your first Legacy is starting to
dialog: manifest.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Legacy?
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: An extraordinary ability. Yours is
dialog: called Lumen. They start a lot
dialog: sooner on Lorien. I was beginning
dialog: to fear yours would never emerge.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You knew this was going to happen?
dialog: Why didn't you say anything?
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I didn't want to worry you. You
dialog: were already under enough pressure.
speaker_heading: (SINCERE)
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: John acknowledges the apology, but looks at him, suspicious.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What else have you been hiding from
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The curtains are drawn. Bernie Kosar dozes on the couch
text: while John and Henri sit at the table, staring at the Box.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: This couldn't be opened until your
dialog: first Legacy appeared. Ready?
text: John nods nervously. Henri places the fingertips of his
text: right hand onto five petal-shaped discs inlaid onto the lid.
text: John cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the
text: âpetalsâ fanned across the opposite side.
speaker_heading: THE DISCS
text: momentarily glow and a SHARP CLICK echoes from within. John
text: and Henri pull their hands away and watch as the Box
text: miraculously comes to life. Fissures of light sweep across
text: the lines of inlaid stone, dividing the lid into sections
text: that begin to twist and reform like high-tech origami.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Whoa.
text: PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold.
text: Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally regroup,
text: creating a new pattern on the lid. It's a familiar geometric
text: symbol. John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his
text: neck -- the symbols are an exact match.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Open it.
text: John nods, cautiously lifts the lid, revealing a neat
text: assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored rocks.
text: They range in size and color but all share a serene beauty.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What are they?
speaker_heading: HENRI
text: Crystals from Lorien's core.
dialog: They'll guide us in your training.
text: John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Place your hand over them.
text: John follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut-
text: sized crystal floats up from the Box. It slowly begins to
dialog: spin and project
text: A SWIRLING HOLOGRAPHIC GALAXY.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Our solar system.
text: Henri points to a planet. Its oceans are dark with pollution
text: and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: That's what Lorien looked like
dialog: thousands of years ago. We had all
dialog: the problems that Earth has today.
dialog: The planet was dying until our
dialog: people made a collective decision
text: to change and slowly Lorien began
dialog: to heal itself -- that's when the
dialog: Legacies started.
text: John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his
text: eyes. Its oceans turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land
text: masses become a lush emerald green.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Only a select few developed these
dialog: abilities. They became known as
dialog: the Garde.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That's what I am?
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Like your parents and grandparents.
dialog: John considers this new information.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The other children in the ship...
text: Henri finishes John's thought.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: They're Garde as well. Once you've
dialog: mastered your Legacies, we'll find
text: them and face the Mogadorians
dialog: together.
text: John looks at Henri, curious.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What Legacy do you have?
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I don't have any and never will.
dialog: I'm your Cepan -- a teacher. My
dialog: job is not just to protect you but
dialog: to train you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Give me your hand.
text: Henri takes one of John's hands and pulls a cigarette lighter
text: from his pocket. John flinches, unsure.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Trust me.
text: Henri flicks a flame to life and sweeps it under John's
text: outstretched palm.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You feel that?
text: Amazingly, the flame harmlessly licks the skin. But when
text: Henri moves the lighter further up John's arm --
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ouch.
text: John jerks his hand away. Henri kills the flame, shrugs.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: When we're done, your entire body
dialog: will be shielded against fire.
text: John rubs his singed wrist.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You'll get other Legacies too.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Flying would be cool.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You don't get to pick them off a
dialog: menu.
text: KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. As John spins to the door, the
text: shimmering galaxy fades and the crystal drops to the floor.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Mogs don't knock.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
text: Henri steps to his computer bank and examines a laptop
text: featuring live feeds from a dozen surveillance cameras he's
text: installed around the property.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: It's a girl.
text: John looks over his shoulder and reacts with surprise.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: John opens the door and finds Sarah amped.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How'd you do it?
text: Her accusation startles him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Eviscerate the entire senior class?
text: She pulls a strip of overexposed 35mm film from her coat.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I was in the darkroom before lunch
text: and they were hanging on the line
text: smiling and looking forward to the
dialog: future. When I got back, I found
text: 15 rolls of negatives wiped clean.
text: John shrugs innocently.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So you weren't in the darkroom
dialog: today?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Here's a tip. If you're going to
dialog: lie, don't leave a big red backpack
text: at the scene of the crime.
text: She swings his backpack into view. John is mortified. He
text: struggles to find a plausible answer and silently tries to
text: quell the feeling welling in his chest.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don't know what happened. Maybe
dialog: it's a sign that you should invest
text: in a digital camera.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Digital sucks. Film tells the
dialog: truth. Clearly, I'm not going to
dialog: get that from you.
text: He watches as she angrily heads down the steps and climbs
text: into her car. John glances at his palms and is surprised to
text: find they are dimly luminescent.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Sarah's car sweeps out of the drive and powers towards town,
text: unaware of the truck parked in the shadows.
speaker_heading: MARK JAYNE
text: is behind the wheel and watches as her headlights fade into
text: the night. OFF his simmering jealousy...
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Bernie Kosar waits expectantly as Henri pours âDoggie Chowâ
text: into a bowl. John steps in.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Everything okay?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: She was returning my backpack.
text: He dumps it by the door.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I think you should stay home from
dialog: school for a couple of days.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Just to be safe.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER
text: Moonlight cuts across Bernie Kosar who is SNORING peacefully

text: sits up, unable to sleep.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - DAWN
text: Nursing a mug of black coffee, Henri diligently scans the
text: laptop screens. He's clearly never gone to bed. He looks up
text: as John enters wearing track gear.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm going for a run.
text: Bernie trots out and wags his tail pleadingly.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: hopscotches from boulder to boulder to the other side.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HILL - DAWN
text: It offers a high-def view of Paradise. John reaches the top

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I think you have the wrong room.
text: She rises, walks past him and begins searching the photos

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Wanted to apologize.
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: SARAH

text: Sam catches John at the lockers.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Nice freakout the other day.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Wasn't feeling well.
text: They twist their combination locks. Sam swings open his
text: door, there's a HISSING POP and
text: A RED INK PACK EXPLODES.
text: It's the kind banks use to foil heists. In a shocking
text: instant, Sam and the contents of his locker are splattered.
text: It bears a gruesome resemblance to arterial spray.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: has his door halfway open and ducks back a second before the
text: ink pack planted in his locker ERUPTS. The spray misses his
text: face but violently spits across his chest and arms. LAUGHTER
text: echoes behind them. John spins and finds Mark and his posse.
text: TIGHT ON John's hands as he balls them and an angry glow
text: flickers through his gloves.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (to John, taunting)
dialog: Told you it wasn't over.
text: Behind them, Sam's laid-back persona cracks. He frantically
text: clears his locker, looking for something. He finally pulls
text: out a photo which drips with ink, reels at the jocks.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Assholes.
text: John looks back at Sam. Mark seizes his chance and launches
text: a sucker-punch at John. But John sees it out of the corner
text: of his eye and in a blur of motion whips up his hand and
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
scene_heading: CATCHES MARK'S FIST.
text: John squeezes it vice-tight. Mark grimaces in agony. His
text: buddies back into the CROWD OF TEENS that has gathered. John
text: leans in close.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That sensation you're feeling --
dialog: remember it.
text: With a quick push, John shoves Mark back against the lockers.
text: Mark DENTS a door and slides to the floor, his eyes flaring
text: with lacerated pride.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Show's over.
text: The crowd disperses. Mark gets to his feet and exits with
text: his friends, but shoots John one final wounded glare...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - DAY
text: Red, ink-stained water Hitchcocks down the drain. John
text: wrings out his black T-shirt. He sees Sam's reflection in
text: the mirror. Sam puts some clothes on the bench.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I raided lost and found.
text: He holds up a puke-green sweater decorated with red snowmen.
text: John turns back to the sink.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know. Nobody loses anything
dialog: cool.
text: He sits and begins to change.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dude, the way you thrashed Mark
dialog: back there. Awesome move.
text: John acknowledges that with a nod. Whip-dries his shirt.
text: Sam plucks up the photo. The ink is now dried and cracked.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Who's in the picture?
text: Sam stares at it, nostalgic.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: My dad. My real dad. I took it
dialog: the summer before he split.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: He dragged me and my mom all over

text: evidence of ancient astronauts.
dialog: All I got was Montezuma's Revenge.
speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (DEADPAN)
dialog: Sounds like a fun vacation.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know. Insane. He called himself
dialog: an anthropologist even though he
dialog: only made it through one semester
dialog: of college.
text: He rises and tosses the ruined picture into the trash.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Always thought he'd come back one

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I heard about the lockers. I'm

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'll live.
text: He starts off again.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I broke up with Mark.
text: He stops, slowly turns back.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I've been thinking about doing it
dialog: for a while... today just finally
dialog: pushed me over the edge.
dialog: 
dialog:

text: He studies her face.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Why are you telling me?
text: She bows her head, suddenly embarrassed.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You made the right call.
text: The certainty of his voice soothes her. She looks up and
text: holds his gaze. Their attraction is undeniable.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Halloween Block Party's tonight.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I saw the banners.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'll be on Main Street hiding
dialog: behind my camera if you want to
dialog: swing by.
text: He says nothing.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I wasn't expecting an actual
dialog: response. I could text you later.
dialog: Do they have cell phones on Planet
dialog: John?
text: She holds out her phone. John looks at it tentatively, then
text: takes it. As he inputs his number, he hears the BLARE of a
text: car horn, looks up and sees Henri waiting in his SUV.
scene_heading: INT. SUV - DAY
text: John climbs in.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Wasn't that your friend from the

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Her name's Sarah.
speaker_heading: (ANNOYED)

speaker_heading: HENRI

text: John stares out the window, guilty.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: A guy was messing with me. I took

speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You're stronger and faster because
dialog: of Earth's gravity -- you shouldn't
dialog: use that advantage to settle petty
dialog: scores.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It was no big deal. Don't blow it
dialog: out of proportion.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You can't risk everything over
text: wounded pride.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I wasn't looking for a fight. It
dialog: just happened. Get off my back.
text: Henri pulls a printout from his coat. John unfolds it.
text: ANGLE ON PRINTOUT: It's from the Florida Keynoter website
text: and features a photo of the charred stilt house.
text: John's gut churns as he stares at the image.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Article says it was arson.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We were clean. There's no way the
dialog: Mogs can track us here.
text: Henri shakes his head, shifts into gear and starts off.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: They can track us anywhere. I
dialog: think it's time you saw what you're

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - DAY

speaker_heading: THE BOX
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 39.
text: is open on the floor between them. John lifts his hand and
text: holds it over the crystals.
text: ONE RISES.
text: It's white and as thick as two fingers. It floats in front
text: of John's face. He tentatively reaches out. When he grips
text: it, a shock wave of light blasts out, totally WIPING OUT THE
text: FRAME and transporting him into
text: A VISCERAL MEMORY.
scene_heading: EXT. LORIEN - NIGHT
text: EXPLOSIONS rock and the SCREAMS of the dying echo. AN OLD
text: MAN hustles A TERRIFIED BOY through the murderous
text: bombardment. The air is choked with ash and smoke.
text: The boy is 7-year-old John. The man is his grandfather.
text: Young John glances up and sees
text: AN ARMADA OF BATTLESHIPS
text: eclipsing Lorien's two moons. The angular hulls of the craft
text: are scarred from galactic battles new and ancient and unleash
text: an endless crisscrossing FRENZY OF MISSILES.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: (in Loric with subtitles)
dialog: Keep moving.
scene_heading: EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT
dialog: It wouldn't look out of place in ancient Rome. Young John
text: and his grandfather race up the steps.
scene_heading: INT. SANCTUARY - TEMPLE - NIGHT
text: A statue of Lorien's most famous warrior, Pittacus Lore,
text: towers in the middle of the chamber. His noble face is
text: illuminated in a shaft of flame-tainted moonlight.
scene_heading: FOOTSTEPS ECHO!
text: Young John and his grandfather scramble across the space and
text: straight into the path of
scene_heading: TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS.
text: The Soldiers' pallid faces flash with smiles. Swords drawn,
text: they move in for the kill when one is skewered in the throat
text: by a crystal-handled dagger.
speaker_heading: MAGENTA LIGHT
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
text: spurts from the wound. The Soldier's body fractures like
text: glass and DISINTEGRATES in a shower of embers as he drops to
text: the floor. The other Mogadorian spins and trades SPARKING
dialog: sword strokes with
text: A CLOAKED FIGURE.
text: It's a violent battle of wills which ends when the Cloaked
text: Figure kicks up the dead Soldier's sword and impales it into
text: the Mogadorian's chest. The Soldier EVISCERATES in a cloud
text: of HISSING cinders.
text: Young John watches in awed terror as the Cloaked Figure steps
text: towards him and pulls back his hood.
text: IT'S HENRI.
text: He looks younger, the years of hiding have aged him. John's
text: grandfather lifts a familiar crystal pendant from his neck
text: and places it over Young John's head.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: This is your Cepan. Go with him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOHN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Your life is my life now. I will

speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
speaker_heading: (TO HENRI)
dialog: He must survive.
text: A BLAST scorches across the space. Henri spots
scene_heading: A MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
text: hunkered behind a column, his red coat billows behind him
text: like a curse.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: They are already hunting you! Go!
text: Henri plucks a crystal ankle-dagger from his boot, grabs
text: young John and charges up. As the Commander breaks cover,
text: Henri hurls the dagger.
speaker_heading: THE COMMANDER
text: dives out of its path but ROARS as the blade SPARK-RIPS
text: across his right cheek like a hot poker.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
scene_heading: EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT
text: Henri yanks Young John by the hand. They take off in one
text: direction while John's grandfather heads off in the other.
scene_heading: A MOGADORIAN TRANSPORT CRAFT
text: suddenly swoops between them. The HOWLS of its occupants
text: ricochet through the night. The heat from its engines washes
text: the ground, warping the destruction like a ghastly mirage as
text: two bay doors open. Young John looks back through the heat-
text: haze and catches a impressionistic view as
speaker_heading: TWO PIKEN
text: leap out. Their reptilian bodies ripple with muscle and
text: their oversize heads glint with raptor-like jaws. The Piken
text: mercilessly rip into John's grandfather. Young John races to
text: help, but Henri wrenches him back. CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT ON
text: YOUNG JOHN'S FACE as he screams...
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOHN
dialog: Nooooooooooo!
dialog: THE MEMORY ENDS and we...
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - DAY
text: TIGHT ON JOHN screaming...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Nooooooooooo!
text: He drops the crystal and stumbles back. The experience has
text: left him traumatized. Henri steps towards him, but John is
text: too overwhelmed and runs out.
scene_heading: EXT. STREAM - WOODS - DAY
text: A stone angrily SKIPS across the water. John is about to
text: toss another when Bernie Kosar trots into view. He ruffles
text: the dog's fur but doesn't turn when Henri steps out of the
text: woods and crosses to his side.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I saw my grandfather. I saw what
dialog: you did to the Mogadorians -- you
dialog: saved my life.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: A lot of Lorics sacrificed their
dialog: lives so that you could live.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
text: John is still trying to process the memory.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He said I must survive.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: The Elders had a plan. You weren't
text: on that ship by chance. The nine
dialog: of you were chosen for a reason.
dialog: Even if only two of you live,
dialog: together you'll pose a grave threat
dialog: to our enemy.
text: Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You saw what they did to Lorien.
dialog: How can nine or six or two of us
dialog: take on that army? It's hopeless.
text: Henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I never thought we'd get off Lorien
dialog: alive -- but we did. I didn't know
dialog: how we could survive on a strange
dialog: planet -- but we have. I gave us
dialog: six months before the Mogs found us
dialog: -- it's been 10 years. Don't give
dialog: up now.
text: Henri grips John's shoulders.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You have the potential to do great
dialog: things. Even if you don't see it --
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: How can you put so much faith in
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Because your life is my life. If
dialog: you quit, then everything I've
dialog: worked for and sacrificed is
dialog: meaningless.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Remember -- nothing is inevitable.
text: The fragile SILENCE is broken when John's cell phone BLEATS.
text: He scans a text.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's Sarah. The Block Party's
dialog: tonight. I'll say I can't make it.
text: Henri sees John is wracked with doubt and confusion.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: No... go.
text: John looks at him, surprised by this paternal gesture.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You've had enough for one day.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - PARADISE - NIGHT
text: A Halloween parade drifts past the CROWDS packing the

text: in costume zigzag past John. It's small-town Americana at
text: its best. ET waddles by holding a JEDI's hand.
text: A SLAP ON GLASS.
text: John turns and is amused to find Sam standing among the
text: mannequins in the display window of a sporting goods store.
scene_heading: INT. ED'S SPORTING GOODS STORE - NIGHT
text: An annoying CHIME plays as the door opens and John enters.
text: The store is deserted. The stock needs to be updated and the
text: shelves could use a dust. Sam approaches wearing an apron.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You work here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Not by choice.
dialog: (pointing to sign)
dialog: Ed's my stepdad. He's under the
dialog: delusion that if people eat enough
dialog: candy apples and kettle corn,
dialog: they'll suddenly have the urge to
dialog: buy sporting goods.
text: John plucks a hockey mask from the basket on the counter.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I put those on special tonight for

dialog: the words âFuture Supervillainâ.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Screw this. Let me lock up. I'll
dialog: hang with you.
text: He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What about your stepdad?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: He hit the tavern at 6:00. He's
dialog: already hammered by now. I'll
text: probably find him passed out on the
dialog: doorstep. Every night is trick âr
dialog: treat at my house.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: John and Sam wander past the parade floats lined up along the

text: candy. John subtly scans the crowd.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: She's over there.
text: John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some
text: KIDS dunking for apples. She pulls the camera from her eye,
text: sees John and smiles as he approaches.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You made it.
dialog: (re: Sam's shirt)
text: Like the T-shirt, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Guidance Counsellor said I need to
dialog: set goals for myself. Figured I'd
dialog: aim high.
text: She looks back at John.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What do you think of Halloween in
dialog: Paradise?
text: John regards a particularly over-the-top float.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They should pull out all the stops

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Well, you haven't had the full
dialog: experience until you've been on the
dialog: Haunted Hayride.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

text: She motions to the picnic area where TEENS are lining up to
text: get on tractor-pulled hay wagons. The wagons lurch through
text: the mouth of a giant cutout devil and into the woods.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Give me a sec.
text: She steps to the face-painting booth. It's sponsored by the
text: local realtor who is Sarah's mom, Annie. Sarah hands Annie
text: her camera. Sam whispers to John.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm impressed.
text: Before John can respond, Sarah steps back.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You guys ready?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Three on a wagon might get a little
dialog: crowded. I'll meet you two on the
dialog: other side.
text: He gives John a not-so-subtle wink of encouragement. John
text: and Sarah join the end of the line and watch Sam head away.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sam's cool.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Definitely unique.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I haven't really talked to him
dialog: since 8th grade. Mark had a tight
dialog: circle. If you weren't a jock or
dialog: cheerleader, you didn't exist.

scene_heading: FIVE GIANT RUBBER SPIDERS

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Not even a flinch. None of this
dialog: scares you, does it?
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: I'm trembling on the inside.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You can smile. I was starting to

speaker_heading: TABLEAUX:

speaker_heading: SARAH

dialog: free.
speaker_heading: A SKELETON
text: pendulums in front of them. Sarah SCREAMS and clenches

scene_heading: âYOUR NUMBER'S UP!â
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
text: are scrawled across it in fake blood.
scene_heading: EXT. TUNNEL - WOODS - NIGHT
text: John and Sarah step through the gate and enter a natural
text: tunnel of dense, overhanging branches. A fog machine gently
text: COUGHS, and spiderwebs stretch across the sides.
text: They are about 20 feet into the tunnel when the lights go
text: out. Somewhere a CHAINSAW sputters to life. White strobe
text: lights suddenly flare on and
scene_heading: TWO CHAINSAW-WIELDING ZOMBIES
text: burst through the gates behind them. The teens take off.
text: It's like a flickering scene from a demented silent movie.
text: The Zombies have almost caught up when the strobe abruptly
text: ends. The SOUND of the chainsaws FADES and John and Sarah
text: stop, panting and LAUGHING with relief.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That was insane.
text: IT'S PITCH BLACK.
text: A werewolf HOWLS somewhere in the darkness. Something
text: brushes past John's leg. He spins, suddenly unsure.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Just part of the ride.
text: He turns, sees a flash of purple light and hears the rustle
text: of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS on all sides.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Are you sure?
text: As he steps forward,
scene_heading: A THICK BRANCH
text: cuts through the dark and viciously SMACKS John on the back.
text: He drops to the ground like a sack. Figures emerge from the

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Let go! Stop it!
text: John tries to stand, but a boot CRACKS him in the ribs.
text: Another strikes the side of his face. He is surrounded. His

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sarah! Sa-
text: His voice is cut off as a fist SMASHES into his jaw and the

text: but is viciously kicked back to the ground.
text: PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as it hardens with blind rage. In a
text: blur of motion he reaches up, grabs two of his attackers by
text: their coats and hammers their skulls together. As they drop,
text: John spins to meet his other two foes with
text: BLINDING PALMS OF LIGHT.
text: The assailants are illuminated in the phosphorescent glare.
dialog: They're not Mogadorians but rather
text: FOOTBALL JOCKS.
text: One is Mark Jayne's buddy Kevin. They're wearing zombie
text: makeup and military fatigues and have night-vision goggles
text: strapped to their faces.
text: John angrily strides forward, palm outstretched.
text: NIGHT-VISION POV: Everything is an overexposed blur until --
dialog: WHAAAAM!!!
text: John brutally clotheslines one, then pummel-rams Kevin in the
text: chest, sending him flying back 10 feet into a tree. Kevin
text: slumps, out for the count. John arcs a glowing hand through
dialog: the darkness.
dialog: SARAH IS GONE.
text: He plucks up the Jocks' fallen goggles and heads off with
text: Terminator-like determination.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: Sarah is carried through the woods by TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS in

speaker_heading: SARAH

scene_heading: EXT. PICNIC AREA - WOODS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SARAH (O.S.)
dialog: (in the woods)
dialog: Help! Somebody!
text: Something about her terrified tone alerts Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sarah?

scene_heading: INT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: Freaky shadows crisscross as John uses his luminescent palms

scene_heading: INT. CLEARING - WOODS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
speaker_heading: SARAH!
text: Sam turns in the direction of JOHN'S VOICE. He's about to
text: head towards it when
speaker_heading: TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS
text: trudge into view. Sam darts behind a tree. Suddenly, the
text: area is flooded with preternatural white light. He can hear
text: the sounds of a SCUFFLE and one of the Jocks flies past and
text: CRASHES in a heap while the other SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: JOCK (O.S.)
dialog: You're blinding me! Stop!
text: Sam cautiously sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where's Sarah? Tell me!!
speaker_heading: JOCK
dialog: Shepherd Falls. Now turn off that

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Are you crazy! Where's John?

speaker_heading: MARK

text: Appalled by his hubris, Sarah turns to leave.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Don't walk away from me!

speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: Back off!

dialog: John! Are you okay?
text: He nods. Mark looks past him, confused.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Where the hell are Kevin and Joe?
text: John holds up a clutch of night-vision goggles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They got spooked.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hey, those are police property!
text: John flings them over Mark's head into the water.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm going to kill you!
text: With lightning speed, John grabs Mark's arm, spins him,
text: pinning him to a tree. Blinded by rage, John jerks Mark's
text: arm up behind his back.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: John! Stop!
text: Mark is in real pain. Transfixed with anger, John keeps
text: twisting. Sarah looks at him, pleading.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That's his throwing arm!
text: But he doesn't stop until she finally steps forward and slaps
text: him across the face. Startled, John lets go.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Football's all he's got.
text: John stumbles back, ashamed, and heads into the woods. Sarah
text: offers Mark a look of disgust and follows after John.
scene_heading: EXT. TREE LINE - NIGHT
text: John charges into view.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: John! Wait.
text: Sarah catches up.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm sorry, I didn't want you to

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at
dialog: myself.
text: She stops, faces him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I had no idea Mark would pull

text: seriously gone off the deep end.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The guy's in love with you. Wants
dialog: you back.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That's not love.
text: Their eyes meet in the moonlight.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Walk me home?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: It's a picture-book perfect neighborhood. Most of the houses
text: are festively decorated with front-yard graveyards and cobweb-
text: festooned trees. John walks with Sarah. They come to the
text: prettiest house on the block.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: This is me.
text: John stares at the dozen jack-o'-lanterns arranged on the
text: porch. They glare back with flickering bucktooth grins.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I know. Wait until the Christmas
dialog: decorations go up. My mom decks
dialog: the halls with so many lights, you
dialog: can see our house from space.
text: Stray TRICK-OR-TREATERS race past. She motions to the cut
text: above his eye, concerned.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You should see a doctor.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: For this? Wouldn't waste their
dialog: time.
text: She looks at him, curious.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You're not going to tell me how you
dialog: took out those football players,
dialog: are you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
text: He says nothing. She smiles.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I really don't get you.
text: She steps closer.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: But I feel like I can trust you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You can.
text: The air is charged.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Good night.
text: Sarah swings open the white picket gate.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Wait.
text: As she turns back, John steps forward and kisses her.
text: Although taken by surprise, Sarah quickly succumbs to his
text: passion. However, as their kiss intensifies,
scene_heading: THE JACK-O'-LANTERNS
text: rise and hover in midair. Sarah has her back to them, but
text: when John's eyes momentarily flicker open, he sees the orbs
text: grinning back. Startled, he pulls away from her.
speaker_heading: THE PUMPKINS
text: instantly drop and SMASH onto the porch, their candles
text: blowing out on impact. Sarah spins and stares at the jack-o'-
text: lanterns, pulp oozes through their cracked shells.
text: Suspicious, she slowly turns, looks at John for an
text: explanation. He does his best to cover his stunned reaction.
text: Fat drops of RAIN begin to fall. John puts up his hood.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I better go.
text: OFF Sarah, watching him melt into the downpour...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I heard on the police scanner that
text: eight boys were beaten up in the
dialog: woods tonight.
text: Henri turns on a light, nursing a mug of coffee. Bernie
text: wakes. John pulls off his hood. Henri looks at the cuts and
text: bruises on John's face.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They won't talk.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: That was a stupid thing to do.
dialog: What were you thinking?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They attacked me. If I hadn't
dialog: defended myself, I'd be in the ER
dialog: right now. Would that have been
dialog: the better choice?
speaker_heading: (STEPPING FORWARD)
dialog: You've got to start trusting me!
text: Emotionally charged, John points his finger at Henri,
text: accidentally causing the mug to telekinetically
speaker_heading: EXPLODE.
text: Coffee and shards splatter across the floor. Henri looks at
text: John, stunned. John shrugs sheepishly.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I was getting to that. I got a new
dialog: Legacy.
text: Henri absorbs that revelation.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Telekinesis. That's a big step.
dialog: Must have been triggered by the
dialog: fight.
text: John doesn't correct him, averts his gaze.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I need to teach you how to control
dialog: these abilities. We'll start
dialog: working on that tomorrow.
text: The conversation is suddenly interrupted by the repetitive
text: WHINE OF AN ALARM. They cross to the bank of computers.
text: Henri urgently stabs commands into a keyboard.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What is it?
text: Henri pulls up a website.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: We got a hit on one of the search
dialog: words.
speaker_heading: (SCANNING)
dialog: It's a paranormal blog. âThey Walk
dialog: Among Us!â
text: ANGLE ON COMPUTER: A video buffers into motion. It's
text: handheld and jerky. It WHIP-PANS over some sand and joins a
text: group of Teens huddled over a figure lying in the surf. He's
text: holding his ankle and light seeps between his fingers.
text: John's chest pounds with fear as he realizes...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That's Sand Dollar Beach.
speaker_heading: HENRI
text: Looks like a cell phone camera.
dialog: There's enough for the Mogs to ID
dialog: your face.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Can you take it down?
text: Henri remains ice calm and starts typing commands.
speaker_heading: HENRI
text: Working on it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm sorry, Henri.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: This isn't your fault. There's
dialog: still nothing to trace us here.
text: Henri glances up from his screen.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: This could take all night. Get
text: some sleep.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: John dumps his hoodie on the floor and slumps on his bed. He
text: pulls his phone out of his jeans and sees a new text message
text: from Sam. He CLICKS it open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
text: PUSH IN ON JOHN'S FACE as he scans the message with alarm.
text: He sits bolt-upright, gripped with dread. He checks the
dialog: message again.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON PHONE: âI SAW WHAT U DID IN THE WOODS. NEED 2 TALK.
scene_heading: 2NITE. MY GARAGE.â
text: JOHN hits delete and clenches the phone in his palm. A bad
dialog: night just got worse.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Henri is illuminated by the dirty glow on the computers.
text: His fingers work the keys with expert precision. He's so
text: focused on the task that he doesn't notice
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: blur ACROSS THE FRAME of one of the surveillance camera
text: screens and disappear into the woods.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: John cautiously approaches. It's a â50s ranch style. The
text: garage adjoins the house. The lights are out. RAIN bullets
text: off the garage door which is partially concertinaed open.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: John slides into view. It takes a second for his eyes to
text: adjust. A pickup sits under a white tarp. There's no sign
text: of Sam until he Boo Radley's out of the shadows behind him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I've narrowed it down to three
dialog: possibilities: you're a genetic
dialog: experiment, you're a freak of
dialog: nature, or you're an
dialog: extraterrestrial.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don't know what you think
dialog: happened tonight...
text: Sam steps closer, watery reflections ripple down his face.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Your hands lit up like a firefly on

dialog: players around like crash test
dialog: dummies, and you took off faster
dialog: than an Olympic runner.

speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Did I leave anything out?
text: John silently reels.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What do you want from me?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I just want to know who you are.
text: John looks at Sam, realizes he's not going to give up. He
text: hesitates, then finally surrenders...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm a survivor from a planet called
dialog: Lorien.
text: Sam absorbs this confession with awe.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Your dad... he's from there too?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Henri's not my dad. He's my
dialog: Guardian. If he found out you knew
dialog: about us, we'd be gone by morning.
speaker_heading: (PLEADING)
dialog: I don't want to leave Paradise.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I won't tell anyone.
text: John nods, grateful.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: There's something I want to show
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The tarp is whipped off the pickup truck. It's an old Ford.
text: Sam and John stand before it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The cops found it abandoned in the
text: middle of Route 20, just south of
dialog: White Sands, New Mexico. It was my
dialog: dad's. He went missing six years
dialog: ago. He was on one of his crazy
dialog: fact-finding trips. He believed we
dialog: weren't alone in the universe.
text: Sam rubs his hand across the hood, wondering.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mom figured he was having an affair
dialog: and took off. All these years I
dialog: thought she was right. Now you're
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That doesn't prove anything.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It proves he wasn't crazy. I'm
dialog: starting to think that he didn't
dialog: bail on us... that maybe something
dialog: else happened out there -- that he
dialog: was taken.
text: The moment is broken by the SLAM of the front door and the
text: sound of ANGRY FOOTSTEPS. Sam instantly tenses.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Guess the bar closed.
speaker_heading: ED (O.S.)
dialog: Sam! Where are you?
text: His speech is slurred and aggressive.
speaker_heading: ED (O.S.)
dialog: You think I wouldn't hear you
dialog: locked up early!
text: John looks at Sam, shocked and concerned.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You going to be okay?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: If he finds you here, it'll be
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Go.
text: Sam crosses to the door leading into the main house and heads
text: inside. SHOUTS erupt almost immediately. John flinches,
text: wanting to intervene, but finally turns, hustles under the
text: garage door and slips into the night...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You look wiped.
text: Henri turns and smiles playfully.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I wasn't the only who was up last
dialog: night.
text: John nervously hands Henri one of the cups and lies...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sarah texted me. I went over to
dialog: her house.
text: Henri buys the explanation and swings back to his computers.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I've tried every trick I know, but
dialog: I can't crack that blog's firewall.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: There must be a way.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: We need to find where the site's
dialog: located and take it offline
dialog: manually. The URL source has been
text: run through a labyrinth of servers,
dialog: it could take weeks to track down.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I want to help.

speaker_heading: HENRI

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - DAY
text: The walls are now adorned with Thanksgiving banners. John

text: of their way, acknowledging the new high school dynamic.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Using his telekinesis, John strains to lift a tennis ball.
text: It momentarily RATTLES, then stops. Henri is not impressed.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: Bernie darts ahead as John and Sarah walk through a crimson
text: cascade of falling leaves. As they kiss, the leaves around
text: them freeze midair and slowly begin to drift upwards.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: John helps Sam with a dusty box. It's stuffed with Sam's
text: dad's old papers and books. We CATCH tantalizing glimpses of
text: images: Stonehenge, Machu Picchu, the Rings of Saturn...
scene_heading: INT. INTERNET CAFE - NASHVILLE - DAY
text: It's a Vandy student hangout. CAMERA DRIFTS over a row of
text: computer terminals and FINDS the Teen Girl who torched the

text: REVERSE TO REVEAL: She is watching the cell phone footage of
dialog: John on the âThey Walk Among Usâ blog.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - DAY
text: Under Henri's watchful gaze, John focuses on a tennis ball.
text: It RISES. John grins in triumph, causing the ball to drop
text: and bounce on the floor. Strike two.
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - DAY
text: Mark silently stews when he sees Sarah and John sitting
text: together at a table.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY
text: Bernie pogos on his back legs, trying to bite the tennis ball

scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY
text: John is fully submerged in an old claw-foot tub.
text: GO TO JOHN'S DISTORTED VIEW LOOKING UP at Henri as he drops a
text: match into the tub. The liquid instantly IGNITES and we
text: realize John's lying in gasoline. He sits up, rests his
text: hands behind his head as the FLAMES harmlessly lick his face.
scene_heading: INT. BACK YARD - HOUSE - DAY
text: The trees are now bare. John stands 20 feet from Henri and
text: nods. Henri flicks the switch of an automated tennis ball
text: server. John's face is a mask of concentration as the yellow
text: balls fly towards him. He holds up his hand and the balls
text: STOP IN MIDAIR.
text: It's like they've hit an invisible wall two feet from his
text: hand. They hang there. John sees a smile sneak onto Henri's
text: face and momentarily loses focus, causing the wall to
text: collapse and the balls to drop into the mud.
scene_heading: END MONTAGE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Bernie looks like a drowned rat. He's sitting in the tub
text: being scrubbed by John and Sarah.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don't see any family pictures
dialog: around. I guess the photo aversion
dialog: is hereditary.
text: He greets the observation with a shrug. She carries on.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Your mom... grandparents. Is there
dialog: anyone else in your life?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They died.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It was a long time ago. It's just

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I get the feeling he doesn't like
dialog: me very much.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: It takes him a while to warm up to

dialog: Sarah considers this.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thanksgiving's tomorrow. Why don't
dialog: you bring your dad and celebrate
dialog: with us?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don't know. Are there going to
dialog: be a lot of people?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: A tsunami of relatives. But don't
dialog: worry, I'll shield you from the
dialog: wave. Besides, I want everyone to

speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I've found the --

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: HENRI

speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I finally tracked the location of

dialog: here. I'm heading up there
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sarah invited us to Thanksgiving.
dialog: I told her we'd be there.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Send my regrets.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You shouldn't go alone. It could
dialog: be dangerous.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I won't risk taking you. I'll
dialog: leave early and be back by five.
text: John looks up and sees Henri sitting in solitude.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Don't you ever get lonely?
text: Surprised by the question, Henri swivels to face him.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: How could I? I have you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You know what I mean. All these
dialog: years, there's never been anyone.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: We aren't like humans. Once we
dialog: fall in love, it's for life. The
text: pain of separation is unbearable.
text: Henri's face clouds with melancholy and he abruptly gets up.
text: As he heads into the kitchen John studies him with new eyes.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - DAY
text: Steam billows as Henri washes up. He keeps his back to John

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What was her name?
text: Henri slots a plate onto the draining board.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Anastasia.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You left her to save me.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You're not responsible for what
dialog: happened to her -- they are.
text: He slowly turns and regards John with deep paternal concern.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I looked at her the way you look at
dialog: Sarah.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: She can't come with us when we
dialog: leave -- and we always have to
dialog: leave, you know that.
text: John nods, not wanting to deal with that reality.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I was hoping to protect you from

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You can't protect me from

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY

text: up the front path. The warm sound of LAUGHTER drifts from
text: inside. He takes a breath and rings the doorbell.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY
text: It's like a Norman Rockwell cover come to life. Every inch
text: of counter space is filled with platters of food.
text: John watches Sarah, Annie, and a boisterous ASSORTMENT OF
text: RELATIVES put the finishing touches to the Thanksgiving
text: feast. KIDS rush in and out in a manic game of tag.
text: John is captivated by the sense of family and celebration --

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Just taking it all in.

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm glad you came.
text: They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Don't mind me.
text: She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Let's get a picture of you two

text: Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Mom. No. John really doesn't like
dialog: having his --
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's okay. Let her take it.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Henri?
text: CLICK. The call is hung up. Suddenly on edge, John redials.

speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)

speaker_heading: MAN (V.O.)
speaker_heading: (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Are you one of them too?
text: John reacts to the chilling menace of the Man's tone.
speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Who are you? Where's Henri?
text: CLICK. John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it,

speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: I need your help.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
text: The teens sit in silence.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Number 417. Henri tracked the URL
dialog: to that house.
text: Sam scans the street.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: I don't see his SUV anywhere.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He would have parked it across

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Stole it from Ed.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Let's move.
text: John yanks Sam's arm away from the door handle.
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Go home. I'll call you when I get

text: OFF Sam as John climbs out alone...
scene_heading: EXT. WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT
text: It's graveyard quiet. John nervously sneaks down the side of
text: the house. His breath fogs as he inch-CREAKS up the wooden
speaker_heading: STEPS TO
text: THE KITCHEN PORCH.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
text: He squats in front of the door. He holds up a luminescent
text: palm and uses it like a flashlight to sweep the interior.
text: WHAT HE SEES: Take-out boxes litter the filthy counter. The
text: sink is swamped with dirty dishes. The light washes across a
text: semiautomatic sitting by a packet of Lucky Strikes.
speaker_heading: SAM (O.S.)
dialog: See anything?
text: Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam creeping towards him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I told you to go!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They might know where my dad is!
text: John realizes Sam is determined. He sweeps his hand back
text: over the kitchen door. His palm illuminates a familiar
scene_heading: CRYSTAL-HANDLED DAGGER.
text: It's lying on the counter by the fridge.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Henri's here.
text: John âturns offâ his palm and reaches for the door handle.
text: Sam anxiously swats his arm away.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Wait! Other than strength, speed
dialog: and night-light, what powers have
dialog: you got?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Telekinesis -- but that's a work in
dialog: progress.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No invisibility, X-ray vision,
dialog: flight?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sam, we drove here.
text: Sam takes a deep breath, psyching himself up.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Okay. I'm ready. Let's do it.
text: But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light
text: suddenly turns on and a MAN enters. He's built like a
text: wrestler and goes by the name of FRANK.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT
text: With a Lucky Strike clenched between his lips, Frank picks up
text: the packet on the table and is pissed to discover it's empty.
text: He crushes it in his fist and crosses to the door.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK PORCH - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT
text: John and Sam are gone. Frank steps out and locks the door.
text: He flicks away his cigarette as he heads down the stairs.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS the butt as it cartwheels into
speaker_heading: SAM'S LAP.
text: He's crouched next to John at the side of the porch. He
text: frantically begins trying to extinguish the stub. John
text: clamps his hand over Sam's mouth and snuffs the cigarette
text: between his fingers. Once Frank's safely around the corner,
text: John releases his hand.
text: The duo silently climbs onto the porch. John squats in front
text: of the door. His hand shakes as he holds it out towards the
dialog: lock and concentrates.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
text: There's a LOUD CLICK.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You just dead bolted it! Way to
dialog: go!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: New plan -- follow Lucky Strike.
dialog: Text me if he comes back.
text: Sam sneaks off after Frank.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT
text: TIGHT ON LOCK as the dead bolt turns by itself and the door
text: swings open. John cautiously crosses the threshold. He
text: holds up his right hand, dims his palm to a dull-blue glow.
text: He retrieves Henri's dagger and tentatively heads into...
scene_heading: INT. HALL - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Everything is filmed with dust. It's freezing and John's
text: BREATH FOGS in the hazy aura his palm casts. The naked
text: floorboards CREAK. Fear bites as John scans the lifeless
text: gloom, not sure where to start.
text: TIGHT ON HIS SHOE as it brushes a mousetrap. SNAP!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
text: His breath catches in his throat. He âturns offâ his hand.
text: His heart thumps as he waits for something to react to the
text: noise. But nothing does. As his eyes adjust to the dark, he
text: notices a rectangle of light faintly leaking from the door
dialog: that leads down into...
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The ancient stairs sag as John slowly descends. The space is
text: illuminated by a single naked bulb. The sound of DRIPPING
text: WATER hammers the silence. John scans the rabbit warren of
text: rooms and sees a figure chained to a chair in the corner.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Henri!
text: He races over. But as he reaches for Henri's gag, a YOUNG
text: MAN steps out of the shadows holding a baseball bat. John
text: turns too late and the bat strikes his left side. He drops
text: the dagger as he falls to the floor, his ribs searing. The
text: man, BRET, raises the bat again. John focuses his mind.
speaker_heading: THE BAT
text: whips out of Bret's grip and torpedoes towards John -- who
text: ducks out of the way as the bat flies past. Confused, Bret
text: lurches forward. John scrambles for the bat, clenches it in
text: his hand, and swings it into the young man's legs.
speaker_heading: BRET
text: knocks the light as he topples into a column and CRASHES onto
text: the cement, out cold. It's over in a violent blur. John
text: sits stunned for a moment. The swinging bulb casts surreal
text: shadows as he spins back to Henri, telekinetically âunlocksâ
text: the padlock securing the chains, and rips off the gag.
text: Henri is groggy and his face is swollen from brutal beatings.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You shouldn't be here.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Your life is my life, remember?
text: Henri tries to shake his drug-induced haze.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I talked my way in. Thought the
dialog: big guy was buying it.
text: He rubs a wound on his neck.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I was asking him about the video
dialog: when the other one shot me from
dialog: behind... some sort of animal
dialog: tranq.
speaker_heading: (DISPIRITED)
dialog: I'm getting rusty.
text: Suddenly, John's phone VIBRATES. It's a message from Sam --
dialog: âGET OUT NOW!â
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We have to leave!
text: John helps Henri up, they race for the stairs when Bret's
text: hand grabs John's ankle, tripping him to the floor.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Henri!
text: Henri smashes his boot into Bret's face, knocking him out for
text: good. John staggers up, they spin for the stairs just as
speaker_heading: SAM AND FRANK
text: head down them into view. Frank holds the revolver against
text: Sam's neck. Their shadows crisscross under the swaying bulb.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Stay planted or I'll blow your
text: friend's head off.
text: Henri looks at John in shock.
speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (RE: SAM)
text: He came to help.
text: John and Henri put up their hands. John focuses on the gun,
text: but as the light bulb sweeps past, he causes it to EXPLODE.
text: THE ROOM PLUNGES INTO DARKNESS.
text: Henri body-slams Frank, sending the revolver skittering. But
text: as he wrenches Sam to safety,
speaker_heading: THE KEYS
text: to the pickup fly out of Sam's pocket and slide under the
text: stairs. John flashes on his palm, casting everything in
text: eerie blue light.
text: On all fours, Frank scrambles for the fallen weapon. It's
text: almost within reach when he is lifted right off the ground by
text: an invisible force.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
text: Sam looks over at John, impressed.
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: (FREAKING OUT)
dialog: You're the one from the video!
dialog: You're the one they're after.
text: With tremendous telekinetic effort, John slams Frank against
dialog: the ceiling.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Tell me what you know!
text: Franks says nothing. John trains his palm light on the big
text: man's face. It's like a blinding interrogation lamp.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Start talking!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't know what they're called.
dialog: The one in the red coat said he'd
dialog: kill me if I didn't do what he
dialog: wanted.
text: This revelation stuns Henri.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: The Mogadorians... they've been
dialog: here?
text: Frank nods in terror.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He told me to call if anyone came
text: asking about the video.
text: Sweat beads John's face from the mental exertion.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: (RE: HENRI)
dialog: They wanted me to hold your friend
dialog: until they got here.
text: Henri urgently retrieves Sam's gun and his dagger.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: We need to go! Now!
text: John âreleasesâ Frank, who drops onto the floor like a whale
text: and is knocked out. At that moment, a razor-thin line of
text: dust drops from the floorboards above.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
text: SOMEONE IS UPSTAIRS.
text: John immediately extinguishes his palm. The trio stands
text: frozen, necks craned up, ears pricked as the floorboards
text: CREAK above them. They are definitely not alone.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT
text: FOUR MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS stalk through the house. Their long
text: black coats SILENTLY sweep. One sniffs the air like a
text: bloodhound and motions towards the basement door...
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT
text: BLAAAAM! -- the door is shredded off its hinges and flies
text: down the stairs. The Mogadorian patrol storms through the
text: cloud of splinters. Frank and Bret lie where they fell, but
text: there's no sign of John, Henri or Sam.
text: Pissed, one of the Mogadorians strides towards a small
text: blacked-out window. He punches out the glass with his fist
text: and catches sight of Sam clambering over the back fence!
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP - NIGHT
text: John, Henri and Sam pile in.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sam, get us out of here!
text: Sam reaches into his jeans, then frantically checks his
dialog: pockets.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I must have dropped the keys!
text: Henri keeps his cool, looks at John.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Start the engine.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I can't.
text: Henri's calm eyes never leave him.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Yes, you can.
text: John nods, puts his hand on the dash and closes his eyes.
text: The engine TURNS OVER but doesn't start. Sam looks up the
text: street, panicked, as
speaker_heading: A MOGADORIAN
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
text: climbs out of a black SUV and storms towards them.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hurry up!
text: John's brow is furrowed with concentration. The Mog
text: unsheathes his sword as he runs. With a superhuman leap, he
text: lands on the hood -- TWAAAAACK! John and Henri spin out of
text: the way as the sword SHATTERS the windshield and impales in
text: the back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair.
text: As the Mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri
text: sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the Mog's neck.
speaker_heading: VRRRROOMMM!
text: The engine ROARS to life. The Mogadorian tumbles off the
text: hood, magenta light spurting from his wound. John turns to
text: Sam, who is petrified, and SCREAMS...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: DRIVE!
text: Sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors the gas. The
text: Mogadorian EVISCERATES in a frenzy of embers. The truck
text: bursts through the blizzard of sparks and STREAK-PEELS away.

scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
dialog: He's the one who slaughtered Number 3 in Africa. His men
text: part as he steps into view and crosses to Frank and Bret who

text: Frank looks at the Commander in terror.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I called you like I said. It's not
dialog: my fault they got away!
text: The Commander steps into the moonlight that seeps through the
text: window. We get our first good look at his face. A gnarled
text: scar runs down his right cheek, identifying him as the same
text: Mogadorian Henri wounded in the escape from Lorien. His skin
text: is deathly pale and his eyes have a cold purple tint.
speaker_heading: MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
dialog: Where did they go?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.

dialog: How should I know? The kid had me
text: pinned to the ceiling.
text: The Commander turns to Bret.
speaker_heading: MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
dialog: Where did they go?
text: Bret is too freaked to even speak. The Commander nods to the
text: Soldiers. They grab Frank and Bret by the heads and yank
text: open their mouths. Frank watches in confused terror as the
text: Commander holds one of the meditation balls.
scene_heading: DOZENS OF TINY RAZOR-BLADES

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: It's only a matter of time. They

dialog: long has he known?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Since Halloween.

speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I trusted you and you lied to me!

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No.
text: His tone is defiant.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: This isn't a discussion.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm not leaving without saying

text: basement. Terrified Teens scramble. John thrashes through
dialog: the crowd, SHOUTING --
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sarah!
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The panicked evacuation spills out. A window EXPLODES and
text: orange flames lick the cold night air. John sees Emily
text: stumble out clutching one of Mark's dogs, Abby.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where's Sarah?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Went back for Dozer.
text: Another EXPLOSION rocks. A COUPLE of drunk Jocks CHEER.
text: John looks back at the house. The fire has taken hold with

text: cuts over the sound of the HISSING FLAMES. It's coming from
text: the second floor. John charges past Mark, towards the house.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's too late. You can't get
dialog: through!
text: John ignores him and runs into the inferno.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: FLAMES sprint up the walls and clouds of black smoke spew
text: from the sectional sofa. Immune to the heat, John heads into
text: the front hall and finds
speaker_heading: THE STAIRCASE
text: is fully engulfed. Fearless, he clambers up the flaming
text: steps. His jeans and shirt catch fire. He's almost reached
text: the top when the staircase BREAKS AWAY behind him and
text: DISINTEGRATES in a cloud of embers.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: It's a raging conflagration. The family portraits blister on
text: the walls. John beelines towards Dozer's PLAINTIVE WAIL
text: which reverberates over the UGLY ROAR of the fire.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST ROOM - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sarah is crouched by the heavy oak bed that dominates the
text: corner of the room, COUGHING, eyes burning from the smoke and
text: heat. Dozer is cowered underneath, HOWLING. Sarah
text: desperately tries to move the bed but it won't budge.
speaker_heading: CRAAAACK!
text: The door rips off its hinges. Through the smoky half-light,
text: Sarah watches as John strides into the room, heroically
text: backlit by flame.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: John!
speaker_heading: (FRANTIC)
text: Dozer's under the bed. He's too
dialog: scared to come out!
text: John strides forward, grips the bed with one hand and
text: effortlessly hoists it. Sarah looks at him, amazed, then
text: scrambles forward and gently scoops Dozer into her arms.
text: John puts the bed back down.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Don't let go of him. I promise I
dialog: won't let go of you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
text: As he lifts them...
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The trio heads into the hall just as an 8-foot section of the
text: floor collapses in front of them. Unfazed, John sprints
text: forward and bridges the hole.
text: ANGLE ON SARAH as she stares at the burning chasm in terror
text: and grips Dozer tighter.
text: John touches down on the other side and doesn't slow as he
text: powers down the hall, which is a SHRIEKING tunnel of fire.
scene_heading: A BURNING BEAM
text: breaks free and swings down in front of them. Sarah SCREAMS,
text: but watches in stunned amazement as John sweeps it out of the
text: way with a telekinetic flick of his hand.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE - MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The second-floor window SHATTERS as John leaps out holding
text: Sarah and Dozer. A ROARING tongue of fire whips his back as
text: he drops to the ground and touches down with Sarah and Dozer.
text: COUGHING and shell-shocked, Sarah puts the dog down.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You okay?
text: She stares at him, unsure.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You walked through that fire
dialog: without getting burned. I saw you
dialog: stop that beam.
text: SIRENS wail in the distance.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'll explain everything... but not
dialog: here...
dialog: (offering his hand)
dialog: Sarah... please?
text: As they take off into the woods, the IMAGE FREEZES, then
text: REWINDS. John and Sarah kneel in the shadows, then FLY
text: BACKWARDS up through the window and INTO the burning house.
text: REVERSE TO REVEAL the Red-Haired Teen watching playback on
text: his FlipVideo camera, amazed. He runs to the back of the
text: house and finds Mark.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
scene_heading: RED-HAIRED TEEN
speaker_heading: (RE: VIDEO)
dialog: Check this out, man!
text: PUSH IN as Mark stares at the footage, stunned.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: John and Sarah walk in SILENCE, dappled in moonlight. He
text: catches her staring at him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Please don't look at me like that.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm still trying to
dialog: process everything I saw and I keep
dialog: coming to the same conclusion --
dialog: what you did isn't possible.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It is for me.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: (off his hesitation)
dialog: For once please tell me the truth.
dialog: It's the hardest thing he's ever had to do.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: My name isn't John. I don't have a
dialog: name, just a number. 4. In fact,
dialog: my whole life can be reduced to
dialog: numbers: like 15 million -- that's
dialog: how many light years it takes to
dialog: get from my planet to Earth. 38 --
dialog: that's how many towns I've lived
dialog: in. Or 3,671 -- that's how many
dialog: days I've been running from an
dialog: enemy that wants me dead. I lied
dialog: to you, Sarah, because I lie to
dialog: everyone. That's how I stay alive.
text: Tears of relief brim as he finally reveals his soul.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I shouldn't be telling you any of
dialog: this. It's dangerous.
text: Emotionally spent, John leans against a tree. She steps

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don't care. I just want to be
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I want that too. But if I stay you
dialog: could get hurt. I have to leave to

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: There's something I want to give
dialog: you first.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: A PHOTOGRAPH OF SARAH AND JOHN

text: She gently tongs the image into a bath of fixing solution.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So you'll always remember me.
text: With exquisite tenderness they kiss. John's palms shimmer.
text: The intensity of the luminescence builds with their rising

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DEPUTY
text: The FBI showed up flashing their

scene_heading: INT. SUV - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Where are we going? Is this about

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: Only now do we REVERSE TO REVEAL
scene_heading: THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER

speaker_heading: MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
dialog: We're hunting for one of the guests
dialog: at your party.
text: He holds up a netbook which flashes with the FlipVideo
text: footage of John's rescue of Sarah. It's posted on YouTube.
speaker_heading: MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
dialog: Do you know this boy?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah, John Smith. But I didn't
dialog: invite him.
speaker_heading: MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
dialog: He's a fugitive. We've been
text: tracking him for some time.
text: Mark smirks, vindicated.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'll help you find him.
text: He points to Sarah's image on the screen.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He's not at Sarah's, I already
dialog: checked. And one of my dad's
dialog: deputies drove by his house --
dialog: nada.
speaker_heading: MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
dialog: He poses a great threat to us.
dialog: Where else could he be?
text: Mark pulls out his cell phone.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I've got Sarah's cell number, maybe
dialog: you guys can trace it?
text: The Commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his men

speaker_heading: MOGADORIAN COMMANDER

speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: John's not at the house. Is he
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: No, but he's all over the internet.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I know.
text: He turns back to his SUV. Sam follows.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Those things from Warsaw -- they're

speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Go back inside. This isn't your

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The hell it isn't. I'm coming with

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL OFFICE - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: The crystal pendant glints against John's chest as he grabs a

speaker_heading: SARAH
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: HENRI
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: High school.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Get out now!
text: At that moment, all the POWER in the school DIES and the
text: headlights of an SUV flash across the window. Fear registers
text: in John's eyes as he realizes...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Too late... they're here.
scene_heading: EXT. SUV - NIGHT
text: The Commander climbs out. Mark follows but is distracted as
text: a trio of black SUVs speeds into the lot followed by a
text: tractor trailer from which inhuman GROWLS echo.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What the hell's in there?
text: He looks back at the Commander who is arming up from the
text: trunk of the SUV. Mark glimpses the arsenal of future-tech
text: machine pistols, double-bladed swords and heavy-duty daggers.
text: He backs away in fearful realization.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You guys aren't FBI.
text: Before he can run, a Mogadorian Soldier grabs him by the neck
text: and constrains him. The Commander pulls
speaker_heading: TWO BANDOLIERS
text: over his broad shoulders. The cartridges are made of crystal
text: and swirl with purple light. Finally, he slips on his
text: trademark red coat and spins towards the school.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: One of John's hands holds Sarah's while the other lights
text: their way as they hurtle down the passage. They've almost
text: reached the doors when they suddenly fly open and
speaker_heading: A FIGURE
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
text: struts into view. We RECOGNIZE her as the mysterious Teen
text: Girl. She swings up an awesome hand-cannon and FIRES right
text: at them. THE BLAST scorches the air between John and Sarah
dialog: but takes out the
scene_heading: MOGADORIAN SOLDIER
text: who was stalking up the hall behind them! John watches in
text: shock as the Mogadorian keels over and SHATTERS into embers.
text: John swings back to the Teen Girl as she strides forward.
text: SHE IS NUMBER 6.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: You oughta keep your heroics off
dialog: the internet.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: Number 6. Where's your Cepan?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: On his way. Where's yours?
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: Dead. The Mogs got her four months
dialog: ago. We had been tracking them.
text: She heads past. John and Sarah follow after her.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Tracking them?
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: We discovered they plan to attack
dialog: Earth. The only thing standing in
dialog: their way is the six of us.
text: The revelation hits John like a wrecking ball.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: You know what that means?
text: John nods with new purpose.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The war starts tonight.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: First we have to get out of here
text: alive and find the others.
text: Six leads them past the impressive trophy case.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What are we up against?
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: There's a commander, a bunch of
dialog: soldiers and two Piken. They'll
dialog: have all the main entrances
dialog: covered.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: The gym, there's a tunnel under the
dialog: stage.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It'll take us out to the stadium.
text: Six acknowledges that info with a curt nod. FOOTSTEPS. Six
text: grabs John and Sarah by their arms and yanks them back
text: against the wall.
text: They hold their breath as one of the Mogadorian Soldiers
text: prowls straight past. He stops for a moment, then turns the
text: corner. Sarah looks across at the mirrored trophy case and
text: sees there's no reflection.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We're invisible.
text: John realizes, turns to Six.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You got any other Legacies?
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: I can control the elements. You?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Lumen and telekinesis.
text: More FOOTSTEPS. John turns and watches in horror as the
text: Mogadorian Commander and a trio of Mogadorian Soldiers sweeps
text: into view. The Commander is holding
speaker_heading: MARK.
text: He is ashen with fear. Sarah has to catch herself from
text: screaming. John makes a move, but Six holds him in place.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: Stay put. They want to draw you
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He's not dying because of me!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
text: ANGLE ON THE SOLDIERS AND MARK. They're heading past the
text: trophy case when JOHN'S VOICE booms out of nowhere.
speaker_heading: JOHN (O.S.)
dialog: Mark! Linoleum! Now!
text: Mark rips free and hits the deck a second before the trophy
text: case EXPLODES. Shards of glass rip into the Mogadorians and
text: trophies torpedo off the shelves and impale the aliens
text: against the far wall. The Mogadorians SCREAM as they flail.
text: John, Sarah and Six break cover. John wrenches Mark to his
text: feet and they take off running. They dash around the next
dialog: corner and find
scene_heading: HENRI, SAM AND BERNIE
text: sprinting towards them, followed by two Mogadorians! Six
text: raises her hand-cannon, BLOWS one of the Mogs away, while
text: John safely leads everybody into...
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
speaker_heading: SIX
speaker_heading: (TO JOHN)
dialog: Barricade the doors!
text: John telekinetically uproots a trio of bookcases that fly
text: across the space and block the door. Sarah turns to Mark who
text: is totally shell-shocked.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What are you doing with them?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They said they were FBI. That John
dialog: was a fugitive. What the hell's
dialog: going on?
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: You've stumbled into a war. So
dialog: shut up and keep your head down.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I see age hasn't mellowed your
dialog: attitude, 6.
text: Mark turns to John, guilt-wracked.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I didn't know they were trying to
dialog: kill you.
dialog: (genuine, to John)
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This isn't your fault -- it's mine.
text: He offers Mark his hand. Mark shakes it. Suddenly, Bernie
text: begins to GROWL.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What is it, boy?
text: Henri sees where Bernie is staring and realizes...
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: He's telling us to run!
text: They take off a second before
speaker_heading: A PIKEN
text: PUMMEL-RAMS through the wall in a shower of bricks, books and
text: paper. It utters a glass-shattering ROAR. John looks back
text: and sees Bernie bravely holding his ground.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Bernie!
text: He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself
text: at the monster. Bernie clamps onto the Piken's neck. He's
text: hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the Piken
text: tries to buck him off. Then something amazing happens --
text: BERNIE BEGINS TO MORPH.
text: He doubles, triples in size and keeps growing. His features
text: become reptilian, gecko-like, his fur turns to spines and in
text: a matter of moments Bernie has transformed into a hulking
scene_heading: ALIEN CREATURE.
text: John looks to Henri as the truth of Bernie's origin dawns.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Bernie's a Chimera. He came with
dialog: us from Lorien.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Guess I wasn't the only one keeping
dialog: secrets.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Somebody had to watch you when I
dialog: wasn't around.
text: They exit while Bernie and the Piken continue to battle.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: John and Henri catch up to the others.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: The gym's this way.
text: A projectile HISSES past John's ear and DETONATES a row of
text: lockers -- BOOOOOM! -- it's like an incendiary grenade. The
text: paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by FIRE.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling heavy-duty weapons that
text: use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts. One
text: FIRES another round. John telekinetically RIPS a door off
text: its hinges. It flies forward, blocks the charge and IGNITES.
text: John spins back and SCREAMS --
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Go! Go! Go!
text: They take off. John follows and uses his telekinesis to
text: fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the
text: fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a
text: projectile SMACKS him in the back. It's like being hit by
text: napalm. As FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps on
scene_heading: THE SPRINKLER HEADS
text: that run the length of the hall. A deluge sprays, dousing
text: the fire. With his clothes smoking, John tears around the
text: corner. The Mogadorians charge after him, but find
text: SIX IS WAITING.
text: BOOOOMM! BOOOOMM! She blasts them at point-blank range.
text: Magenta light gushes from their wounds. Like rain hitting
text: hot coals, their bodies HISS as they crack and cinder.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: Keep moving!
text: Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race out of view. Then John sees
text: something emerge through the smoky, water-choked haze.
dialog: IT'S THE SECOND PIKEN!
text: It utters a low, predatory GROWL and launches itself forward.
text: Oddly, Six doesn't move. She closes her eyes and lays one
text: hand on the flooded floor, turning the water to
dialog: ICE!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
text: In a matter of moments, the hall has been transformed into an
text: icy tunnel. The sprinklers spray snow. The Piken struggles
dialog: to find purchase in this new frozen environment and slip-
text: slides after John and Six, who disappear into...
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: CRAAAAACK! The doors are DEMOLISHED as the Piken flails off
text: the ice. It takes out a row of tables and chairs and skids
text: to a stop. It ROARS in humiliated FURY, and its red eyes
text: scan for John and Six who are nowhere to be seen.
text: The Piken prowls behind the serving counter. Snow beads off
text: its back. Its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare, sensing
text: something. It hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans
dialog: that are stored below.
text: REVEAL JOHN AND SIX. They're invisible. John clutches Six's
text: arm. They're lying between a stack of roasting dishes.
text: Threads of foamy drool drip onto their faces as the Piken
text: pokes its head further. Its ghoulish red eyes seem to stare
text: right at them. With a final frustrated SNORT, it carries on.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: Henri, Sarah, Sam and Mark race into view. Sarah stops,
text: panicked and afraid.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Where's John?
speaker_heading: HENRI
text: Right behind us.
text: He offers her his hand. She's about to take it when
scene_heading: A MOGADORIAN SOLDIER
text: steps out of the shadows. There is nowhere and no time for
text: Henri and the others to run. But as the Mogadorian squeezes
text: the trigger of his hand-cannon, the wall on his right
speaker_heading: ERUPTS!
text: Bernie and the first Piken crash into the hall. They are
text: still at each other's throats and don't even notice as they
text: steam-roller over the Mogadorian, squashing him like a bug.
text: The creatures SMASH through the opposite wall and out of
text: sight. It's over in a violent blink.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: John and Six sneak through the shadows. She steps to the
text: door, but it won't budge.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: They've blocked it. Use your
dialog: telekinesis.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We're not leaving without my
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: Don't you mean the girl?
text: John ignores the jibe and turns back. Six grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: I broke the Elders' spell to find
dialog: you. The Mogs can kill me now. We
dialog: have to go.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We stay and fight.
dialog: OFF his determination...
scene_heading: INT. HOME ECONOMICS ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: Henri and Sam crouch behind one station while Sarah and Mark
text: hide in the one opposite. Henri pulls a selection of weapons
text: from the backpack. He hands one to Sam, looks over at Mark.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: You know how to use one of these?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: My dad's the sheriff.
text: He slides two across the floor. The door opens. They swing
text: up to fire but find -- John and Six.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Save it for the Mogs. Let's go!
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: Bernie and the Piken pummel the rows of lockers which
text: COLLAPSE like dominos. Gashed and exhausted, the battling
text: duo SHATTER-SMASHES into
text: THE SHOWER STALLS.
text: Water SPURTS from a broken pipe. The Piken slips on the
text: slick tiles. As it struggles to right itself, Bernie seizes
text: the moment and sinks his fangs into the monster's neck.
speaker_heading: THE PIKEN
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
text: desperately thrashes. Its talons viciously rip into Bernie's
text: side. Ignoring the pain, Bernie doesn't let go until his foe
text: finally jerks to stillness. As Bernie sinks to the floor, he
text: MORPHS back into a beagle and lies spent and bleeding...
scene_heading: INT. GYM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: John leads the group past the bleachers and points to the
text: side of the stage.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The door's over here. The tunnel
text: leads out to the stadium.
text: Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of
text: metal doors. John holds up his hand, snaps the lock and
text: whips the chain free. The doors fly open,
speaker_heading: TWO MOGADORIANS
text: spring out of the dark. One tackles Henri while the other
text: blindsides John. Henri struggles until
speaker_heading: BOOOOOM!
text: The BLAST cinders the Mog's head clean off. Henri looks over
text: and sees Mark holding a smoking shotgun and nods his thanks.
text: The second has John pinned when it suddenly ROARS in agony
text: and disintegrates into a shower of sparks, revealing
dialog: SIX.
text: She sheathes her dagger and helps John up.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: Saving your life. My new hobby.
text: Sarah notices a smile of respect flicker between John and
text: Six. PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! -- three Mogadorian
text: knives razor the air. One impales Six in the shoulder. She
text: slumps at John's feet. Henri opens FIRE on the
scene_heading: THE COMMANDER AND TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS
text: who storm towards them. John SCREAMS to Sam and Mark.
speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (RE: SIX)
dialog: Get her down the tunnel!
text: They grab Six by the arms and drag her into the tunnel.
text: Sarah glances back at John and follows after them. Henri
text: takes out a Soldier. John sweeps up his hand and
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
text: THE WOODEN FLOOR OPENS LIKE A ZIPPER!
text: The Commander and the other Soldier are sent flying as the
text: planks rip free of their nails. John and Henri charge into
text: the tunnel. The doors fly shut behind them and the bleacher
text: stand rolls forward to seal the entrance.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: Sarah is in the lead. Sam and Mark follow, holding the
text: wounded Six. They've almost reached the end when
speaker_heading: A MOGADORIAN
text: lurches into the mouth of the tunnel. Without a second's
text: hesitation, Sam swings up his gun and BLASTS it. Mark looks

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I play a lot of Xbox.
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Don't stop! Get to the woods!
text: She nods and exits with the others.
text: John and Henri head onto the field after them when
speaker_heading: THE SECOND PIKEN
text: leaps out of the mouth of the tunnel behind them. It's
text: seriously pissed. It bounds straight towards John. Its
text: fangs glint like barbed wire as it launches itself towards
text: him. At the last second,
speaker_heading: HENRI
text: nobly shoves John out of the way and is plucked into the
text: Piken's jaws. The creature shakes him like a rag doll and
text: flings him 50 feet down the field. John watches, anguished,
text: as Henri lands in a heap.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
text: The Piken pivots, turns its crimson eyes on John. It almost
text: seems to smirk. Its fangs are stained with Henri's blood.
text: John's face hardens into a mask of rage.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
text: He makes no attempt to flee as the Piken charges. As it
text: springboards into the air...
text: ANGLE ON JOHN'S HANDS -- as they suddenly clench.
text: ANGLE ON THE GOALPOSTS -- as they're SNAPPED clean off their
text: bases and fly skyward.
text: ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him.
text: ANGLE ON THE PIKEN -- as it arcs towards John with its mouth
text: open and teeth bared. Suddenly, the goalposts spear its
text: flanks, impaling it like supersize BBQ forks.
text: The three-ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks
text: onto the 20-yard line. John watches impassively as the red
text: life-fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: The stadium looms in the distance. Sam wrenches the dagger
text: from Six's shoulder while Sarah and Mark anxiously watch.
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: John sinks by Henri's side.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Henri.
text: Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked
text: with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John tries to
text: drag him to his feet.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Come on, taillights in five.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: I won't be coming with you this
dialog: time. Save yourself.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We go together!
text: Henri smiles, grateful, but at that moment
scene_heading: THE COMMANDER'S SWORD
text: flies past John and impales Henri in the chest. Henri utters
text: a GROAN and his dying eyes meet John's.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Find the others.
text: His voice is a GRAVELLED WHISPER.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: Your life is my life... always.
text: His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip.
text: Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily
text: flicker with a radiant blue light. He angrily spins to face
scene_heading: THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
text: But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps
text: his hand around John's throat and plucks him into the air.
text: He's flanked by the remaining Soldiers. John's feet kick
text: uselessly as he's lifted face to face.
speaker_heading: MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
dialog: Number 4.
text: Three Loric pendants dangle from the Commander's belt like
text: mocking trophies.
speaker_heading: MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
dialog: Your Cepan saved you on Lorien.
text: The Commander's voice hisses with cruel certainty. He
text: wrenches his sword from Henri's corpse.
speaker_heading: MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
dialog: But this moment was inevitable.
text: The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it.
text: John's eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him. This is
text: the moment his adolescence officially ends. This is the
text: moment when a warrior is born.
text: ANGLE ON BLADE as it SHATTERS into a million pieces, which
text: flutter to the ground like glittering confetti.
text: John stares at the alien with calm confidence.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Nothing is inevitable.
text: ANGLE ON JOHN'S HAND AS IT IGNITES.
text: The flame is hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene
text: torches. He grips one of the Commander's bandoliers.
text: TIGHT ON THE MOGADORIAN'S FACE as he realizes it's over.
text: The glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction.
text: IT'S LIKE A NUCLEAR IMPLOSION!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
text: John, the Commander, the Mogadorian Soldiers, in fact every
text: goddamn thing in the stadium is obliterated in the
scene_heading: SUPERNOVA OF FIRE
text: that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: Sarah looks back as the blistering vortex of flame lights the
text: night sky. Her breath catches in her throat.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh my God... John.
text: Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting
dialog: for the stadium.
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT
text: It's a smoking ruin. The seats have melted into puddles.
text: Sarah bursts into view. She looks across the devastated
text: field. The grass has been reduced to a charred black carpet
text: of stubble. Nothing remains of Henri or the Mogadorians.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: John!
text: She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope.
text: Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes
text: completely burned away. She stops, puts her hand to her
text: mouth to stifle a sob, when he COUGHS and stirs.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: John!
text: Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side. They wrap
text: each other in their arms. Neither wanting to ever let go.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PICNIC AREA - WOODS - DAWN
text: The sky is cracked with the first light of day. Sarah is
text: dressing Six's wound at a table. Six winces.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn't
dialog: cover extraterrestrial dagger
dialog: wounds.
text: Six smiles, grateful.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
text: As the two teens size each other up, CAMERA FINDS Mark. He
text: hangs up his cell and crosses to John and Sam, who are
text: talking intently by the motorcycles. John is now wearing a
text: pair of old jeans and a faded denim jacket.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The Sheriff's Department is
dialog: starting to put up roadblocks. You
dialog: guys better get moving.
text: Six and Sarah join them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You good to go?
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: Don't worry about me.
text: John nods to Sam.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sam, ride with Six.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: We don't need baggage.
text: Sam steps in front of her, determined.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I have to find out if the Mogs took
dialog: my dad.
text: Six turns to John, who is not bending, then glares at Sam.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: You slow us down, I'll shoot you
dialog: myself.
text: Sarah looks at John, tries to rein in her emotions.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I want to come too.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You need to stay here.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You could have died last night.
dialog: I'm not putting you in danger
dialog: again. Mark's promised to look
dialog: after you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
text: Tears tumble down her cheeks.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don't want to say goodbye.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'll come back for you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: When it's safe.
text: She bows her head, anguished. He gently lifts her chin.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where I'm from, we only give our
dialog: heart to one person. I've given
dialog: mine to you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I love you, Sarah.
text: Their lips meet and they kiss. It only ends when John hears
text: an URGENT RUSTLE in the woods. They turn and watch as
speaker_heading: BERNIE KOSAR
text: limps into view. Blood mats his fur and his face is
text: scratched but he's alive. OFF John's relief...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PICNIC AREA - DAY
text: Sam sits behind Six on her motorcycle. John holds Bernie as
text: he straddles his Harley. Bernie morphs into a gecko and
text: darts into his pocket. Sarah studies John and Six, unsure.
text: John THROTTLES the bike to life, then looks back at Sarah.
text: He fights a pang of jealousy when he sees her standing at
text: Mark's side. RAIN spits as the motorcycles start off.
speaker_heading: JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: This is the first town I've left
dialog: without Henri. The first one I
dialog: have a reason to come back to.
text: John and Sarah hold each other's gaze, desperately trying to
text: brand the image of their faces onto their memories.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY
text: The bikes blur past the âWelcome to Paradiseâ sign.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: He warned me the pain would be
dialog: unbearable if I left her. He was
dialog: right.
scene_heading: EXT. TEXAS PLAINS - DAY
text: A straight stretch of blacktop bisects the sunbaked flatness.
speaker_heading: JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: But I don't regret it. The pain
dialog: reminds me what's at stake.
text: A dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view.
speaker_heading: JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: We must find the others and face
dialog: our enemy together. I'm not sure
dialog: how we can stop them. But nothing
dialog: is inevitable. I know that now.
text: Thunderheads darken the horizon.
speaker_heading: JOHN (V.O.)
dialog: I am Number 4.
text: His eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the
text: battles yet to be fought. He's ready to face a future
text: unmapped and uncharted. Ready.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
