dialog: Dear patrons of the Silent Drama ...
dialog: In this present era of discovery and invention
dialog: Spiritualism and other psychic phenomena are scoffed
dialog: at by the masses in general. Therefore, we ask you
dialog: to bear with us while we unfold for your entertain-
dialog: ment, the story of the "Opera Ghost" which really
dialog: did exist according to the memoirs of the late M.
dialog: Faure, Chief of the Paris Secret Police, whose
dialog: weird tale of a criminal investigation which lead
dialog: him to an opaque veil that cloaked the supernatural
dialog: now lies in the archives of the National Academy
dialog: of Music in the French Capitol.

text: CLOSE SHOT on a volume which rests on a rich
dialog: velvet table scarf-- on the book is the title in
scene_heading: French --MEMOIRES OF M. FAURE, CHIEF OF THE PARIS
text: SECRET POLICE. As the French letters dissolve into
dialog: English and we play long enough to identify, a
text: hand enters scene and opens volume to the preface.
text: 2.			CLOSE VIEW of the first page of the Preface which reads:
dialog: To whom it may concern:-
dialog: Before unfolding my hair-raising experience in
dialog: making an investigation of the murderous crimes at-
dialog: tributed to the "Opera Ghost" it will be necessary
dialog: for me to relate a few interesting facts concerning
dialog: the Paris Opera house, where the Ghost existed.
dialog: The Paris Opera house was conceived by Louis
dialog: Napoleon III, after an unsuccessful attempt to
dialog: duplicate the world power of his illustrious uncle,
dialog: the great Napoleon, as a sop to his suffering and
dialog: war-ridden subjects.
text: (a hand turns the page over revealing a picture of
dialog: Louis Napoleon III, as the military emperor)
dialog: It was designed and executed by that
dialog: celebrated architect, Jean Louis Charles Garnier, who
dialog: later built the Forum of Trajan and the Temple of
dialog: Vesta in Rome--and the Casino at Monte Carlo.
text: (A hand turns the page over revealing a picture of
dialog: Jean Louis Charles Garnier)
dialog: No European capital possesses an opera house
dialog: so comprehensive in plan and execution, nor can
dialog: boast an edifice so vast and splendid.
text: (A hand turns the page over revealing a picture of
dialog: the Paris Opera house to show its magnitude and
dialog: decorative design.)
dialog: Its construction began in 1851, and was es-
dialog: timated to cost thirty-five million francs, and it
dialog: required twelve years for completion. It contains
dialog: 583 dressing rooms, 2551 doors and 7893 keys; 14
dialog: furnaces and 450 grates; 16 miles of gas pipe, 9
dialog: reservoirs and two tanks holding 22,222 gallons of
dialog: water.
text: (A hand turns the page over and we read further)
dialog: During the revolution of 1870, the con-
dialog: struction was halted for a time, when Napoleon III
dialog: lost his throne and the present Republic of France
dialog: was declared.
dialog: It was during those dark days of bloodshed
dialog: that the building was used as a military head-
dialog: quarters. Its vast cellars turned into dungeons
dialog: for prisoners, and secret passages and torture
dialog: chambers installed to satisfy the blood lust of a
dialog: crazed populace.
text: (A hand turns the page over revealing the first
dialog: page of M. Faure's memoirs.)
dialog: Many were the skeptics who scoffed at the
dialog: idea of the "Opera Ghost" but the few upon whose
dialog: word I could rely believed in its existence;
dialog: vowing that the opera house bore a curse, dating
dialog: back to the time when the Second Commune carried on
dialog: a wholesale massacre of the Nobility in the dark
dialog: cellars. LAP DISSOLVE INTO:
scene_heading: 3.			EXT. PARIS OPERA HOUSE.
dialog: It is night and under the gas lights we see the
dialog: arrival of the nobility and the elite of Paris in
text: carriages. There are a throng of curious bystanders
dialog: of both sexes eager to see the aristocracy.
scene_heading: 4.			INT GRAND STAIRCASE #1. . . AMBER
dialog: This is a cross shot of the staircase, something of
text: the view shows in the first illustration in the book.
text: The scene presents a gorgeous picture. Circulating
dialog: on the stairway are the elite, the wealthy, the aris-
dialog: tocratic, the military, the fashionable of Paris.
dialog: The carriage and general manner of the people is very
text: light and informal. Some wear opera hats tilted at
dialog: an angle, and others not. The men, women, officers
dialog: and attendants of the opera are dressed for the
dialog: period of approximately 1890. The women are
dialog: beautifully gowned as the Paris Grand Opera is the
dialog: show place of the fashionable world. The number of
dialog: people will be governed by what is required to
dialog: comfortably fill the big set. Crowds will also be
text: seen moving in the four galleries, while others will
text: circulate upon the staircases which lead downward at
text: either side of the main stairs. It is a scene of
dialog: gaiety and laughter.
scene_heading: 5.			INT. GRAND STAIRCASE #2. . AMBER.
dialog: This is a longer shot taking in the set -- up to
dialog: and including the third gallery. This is as high

speaker_heading: LONG SHOT. . AMBER.
dialog: It is the hour before the overture and first
dialog: curtain of the opera Faust --The curtain is down
dialog: and people are entering from both side entrances,
dialog: and the entrance below the Portierre. The
dialog: aisles are crowded, not only with those seeking
dialog: their seats, but also with groups. All are laughing
text: and talking. The atmosphere is free and informal.
text: Many are standing or lounging against the seats,
text: gossiping with acquaintances a few seats distant.
text: The chandelier is a blaze of light. The musicians
dialog: (71 including the director) are filling in and
text: taking their places in the orchestra pit. There is
text: life and a fluttering of motion in all of the boxes
text: except Box Five and one on the opposite side.
speaker_heading: 8.			A LONG SHOT. .AMBER
text: As people are seen from high, shooting down upon
dialog: the orchestra and stage and is calculated to show

scene_heading: 11.			INT. ON BACK STAGE. . AMBER
dialog: This is a general shot of the backstage before
dialog: the rise of the curtain and must be most interesting
dialog: and picturesque. THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE IS ONE
text: OF CHAOS and confusion. Sixty stage hands are
text: moving about the large pieces of scenery. They are
dialog: putting up the set for the first scene, the
dialog: home of Faust the aged alchemist. In evidence
dialog: are carpenters, florists, drapers, curtain hangers,
dialog: firemen, call-boys and property men. In the rear
dialog: of the stage is the dressing room corridor
dialog: leading to the numerous dressing rooms.

text: forehead and exhales deep sighs of despair while
text: Poligny stares into space with a gloomy expression --
text: at his desk nearby sits M. Lavelle, their secretary,
dialog: a bright dapper fellow, whose whistling at such

speaker_heading: CLOSE UP OF JOSEPH
dialog: 
dialog: This is a character study of an opposite type to

dialog: and making agonized faces.
dialog:

speaker_heading: SEMI C.V. JOSEPH BUQUET.
dialog: 
text: As Simon enters scene and affectionately rubs his

dialog: 
dialog: Another section of same corridor as in 13. Here we see a
dialog: general commotion of ballet girls, some in pink
dialog: tights and others partly dressed running in and
dialog: out of dressing rooms buying and drinking cassaie
text: and beer from a vendor. Some are singing - some
dialog: dancing and some quarreling.
dialog: 
text: AN INTIMATE SHOT OF GROUP OF BALLET GIRLS.

dialog: GO DOWN IN THE CELLARS AND

dialog: 
text: As frightened ballet girl runs toward rear while

text: the rear. He starts up the step toward the
dialog: dressing room corridor. The six ballet girls,
text: holding each other by the arms and huddled together,
text: enter to the landing in the stairs. They pretend

scene_heading: INT. CELLAR SHOT. .#4. . FAINT GREEN
text: This is the set in which there is a headless statue.
text: In this scene, however, the light is not on the
text: headless statue and it can hardly be seen. Joseph
text: Buquet is at work under a shaded gas jet, sewing up
dialog: the cheek of John the Baptist. Florine and the ballet
text: girls enter. The girls huddle around Buquet as
dialog: if they found protection in his presence. They begin
text: to question the glassy eyed man, he looks around
dialog: apprehensively as if all the shadows might be
text: inhabited. As Buquet talks he switches the head
dialog: around, sometimes holding it by the hair. This
text: head has practical eyes that open and close. Buquet
dialog: tells them:
dialog: "HIS EYES ARE SO DEEP THAT YOU
text: CAN HARDLY SEE THE PUPILS. .
text: JUST TWO BLACK HOLES IN A DEAD
speaker_heading: MAN'S SKULL."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BACK:
dialog: The girls show horror and fascination. A pained

dialog: tinues:

speaker_heading: STRETCHED ACROSS HIS BONES LIKE
scene_heading: A DRUMHEAD. HIS NOSE. . THERE
dialog: IS NO NOSE!"

dialog: 
dialog: "YOU KNOW THE GHOST DOESN'T
text: LIKE BEING TALKED ABOUT."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BACK:
text: Buquet looks into Florine's face with his big

speaker_heading: BETWEEN THE SCENE OF A FARM HOUSE

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BACK:
dialog: This is too much for Florine. He decides not to go
text: with them and begins to walk away, but the girls
dialog: grab him. They are not going to be left alone
dialog: with Buquet after what he has said. Buquet leads
text: them down a flight of stairs; after he has care-

text: on the head until he is out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CELLAR SET #5. . FAINT GREEN
dialog: This is the "King of Lahore" set. On the left is
dialog: a suggestion of a farm house scene, the elaborate
dialog: piece of "King of Lahore" scenery, then a circular
text: staircase, and on the right, a scene rack which is
text: moved by a hand switch. In front of the "King of
dialog: Lahore" scenery is a concealed trap in the floor

dialog: 
text: Buquet points his skinny finger at the dark
dialog: column of the "Lahore" set and begins to explain
dialog: that it was in that shadow that he saw the Ghost.
text: The girls are looking into the shadow, fascinated,
dialog: as if the Ghost might appear there again. But
text: Florine is looking at the dark opening in the wall
text: behind the set. His eyes are fixed upon something
text: and he stands stiff and paralyzed.

dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE UP FLORINE. .FAINT GREEN

scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT. . FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
dialog: The girls almost die of fright, genuine fright this
text: time. There is a frightened clamor on the part of
dialog: the girls and Florine to be the first to reach the
text: circular staircase. Buquet stands quietly looking
text: at them with his hollow, glassy eyes. The girls
dialog: reach the stairs and run up the circular stairs
text: laughing at each other and screaming. Florine
text: tears up the staircase to the first landing when
text: his momentum carries him out of the opening and
text: upon the floor at his starting point. He tears
dialog: up the stairs again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CELLAR #4. . FAINT GREEN.
dialog: 
text: This set is now seen in another lighting so that
text: the big headless statue with outstretched arms
text: stands in bold relief. The girls fleeing in
text: terror, followed by Florine, run up the stairs into
text: the picture and almost into the arms of the headless
dialog: statue. They break away from the statue and
dialog: run out the right. Florine takes a short cut,
text: running out the right, back of the pile of prop-
dialog: erties.
speaker_heading: CELLAR #3. . FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
dialog: This is the Sigfried dragon's head. The girls
dialog: run in from the left, get their reaction of fright
text: from the dragon and run off to the right. Florine
text: runs in and stops to get his breath. He knows all
dialog: about the ordinary props down here and is not
text: afraid. Door in dragon's mouth opens and in-
text: definite shadowy figure is seen in back. He gives
text: one sickly look of terror and runs out to the right.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CELLAR #2. . FAINT GREEN.
dialog: This is the dummy set. The girls run in and shrink
dialog: from the dummies which are hanging in insane
text: postures, one up-side down, another with a broken
text: back. One of the girls gets tangled up in the
dialog: ropes which hold the dummies and they begin to
text: jerk up and down and their arms flap. The other
text: girl rescues the one in the ropes and they run out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CELLAR BRIDGE SET. . FAINT GREEN
text: At the right of this set is a trap-door elevator.
text: Florine runs in, jumps on the elevator and pulls a

scene_heading: EXT. ON BACK STAGE. .AMBER
dialog: 
text: This shot is back of the scene. Simon is peeping
text: through the scenery and talking to a stage hand.
text: A couple of feet from him a trap falls open and
text: Florine shoots up into the air about four feet,
text: lights on his feet, nonchalantly tries to appear
dialog: that he is doing his regular work, picks up a
text: prop and walks off. Simon looks after him with
dialog: suspicious exasperation.

scene_heading: INT. LA SORELLI'S DRESSING ROOM. . AMBER
dialog: 
dialog: This is a conventional dressing room, such as
dialog: would be furnished to a star, or to La Sorelli, who
dialog: is the head of the ballet. She is also the
dialog: friend of the younger dancers. The scene is one
dialog: of languor, a little of what people expect of Parisian
dialog: naughtiness. A beautifully formed, languorous
text: creature is reclining upon a couch and is being
dialog: entertained by two or three smartly dressed young
text: Parisians. La Sorelli is before the mirror with
text: an admirer and her maid. The admirer playfully
dialog: takes the place of the maid and is allowed to
text: fasten the top button in the back of her dress.
text: Their playful pastimes are interrupted by a violent
dialog: knocking at the door.

dialog:

dialog: They all cluster around La Sorelli and cry out
dialog: together:
dialog: "WE SAW THE GHOST!
speaker_heading: THE OPERA GHOST!"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BACK:
dialog: La Sorelli is superstitious concerning the ghost
text: and she shudders. She of all in the room takes it
text: seriously. The dandies laugh at the idea, as if
dialog: it were some new trick the girls were playing.
dialog: The girls all continue talking at once to La Sorelli
text: who tries to conceal her growing fright by laughing.

scene_heading: CLOSE UP FIRST BALLET GIRL. . AMBER

scene_heading: SHOOTING FROM THE STAGE. .AMBER.
dialog: 
dialog: This shot shows the vast audience from this angle,
dialog: settled in their seats for the performance, but in
dialog: the f.g. is the prompter's box. The prompter is
text: arranging his papers. He is a dapper, grouchy little
text: fellow. He bends down until he is almost out of
text: sight, the opening from the stage to the prompter's
dialog: box must be large enough to admit a person through it.

dialog: and machinery. This room is under the stage and
text: in it is a short flight of steps leading to the
text: platform upon which the prompter is standing. The
text: light control man is standing near his levers but
dialog: has evidently neglected to watch the time. The
text: prompter, who can be seen bending down from his
dialog: box, calls the man's attention to the time. The
text: control man looks at his watch which is hanging in
text: front of him and immediately begins to pull two
text: levers, each in an opposite direction. Aside from
dialog: the interesting nature of this shot it seems to

text: This is located in the rear of the stage.
dialog: The richness of this room is executed principally

dialog: inence are the dancers' practicing bars. They hold
dialog: to those bars while standing upon their toes or
dialog: place one ankle upon the bar while they stand upon
dialog: one toe and while they are doing these things
dialog: they are talking to their admirers. This is a gen-
dialog: eral entrance scene of the ballet girls and thirty
dialog: or more young and old Parisian dandies, patrons of
dialog: the opera, who are allowed in the foyer de dance
text: during the intermissions. It is a picture of pink

scene_heading: INT CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM. AMBER
dialog:

speaker_heading: C.V. OF RAOUL.

dialog: thoughts of long ago. Christine's dress is so
dialog: conceived that it will lend to the spiritual quality
dialog: of her character. She is sad and passive and looks
dialog: a frail little figure.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP CHRISTINE.
dialog: 
dialog: Her spirituality and the mystery surrounding her are

dialog:

dialog: impetuously:
dialog: 
dialog: "WHY DIDN'T YOU WISH TO RECOGNIZE
dialog: ME IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM?... WHY
dialog: WERE YOU SO ANXIOUS FOR ME TO GO?"
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK: The bright eagerness dies out of her eyes.
text: She stands staring at Raoul without replying.
dialog: She cannot answer because there is too much to
dialog: explain. 'You don't answer' he indicates
text: unhappily. Then with an outburst of jealousy
dialog: and suspicion, he exclaims:
dialog: 
dialog: "I'LL ANSWER FOR YOU! ..IT WAS
dialog: BECAUSE THERE WAS ANOTHER WITH YOU...
dialog: A MAN FROM WHOM YOU MUST HIDE OUR
dialog: ROMANCE!"
text: BACK: Christine's eyes dilate wider in

speaker_heading: CLOSE UP RAOUL & CHRISTINE.
dialog: 
text: At these words from Raoul, a deathly pallor spreads
text: over Christine's face...she almost faints. Raoul
dialog: becomes conscious of his odious behavior and seeks
text: to apologize. Then suddenly her eyes moisten and
text: two great tears roll down her cheeks. Raoul tries
text: to take her in his arms, but she escapes and flees
dialog: in great disorder. Raoul calls after her, then
text: angry at himself...turns and gazes, gloomily out
dialog: over the sea.
dialog: 
text: ANOTHER SECTION OF THE LITTLE GARDEN.
dialog: 
text: As Christine flees into scene from behind camera.

dialog: 
text: Raoul is gazing despondently out to sea when Christine

dialog: her to him, when she says:
dialog: 
dialog: "I WANT TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO YOU"
dialog: 
dialog: BACK: Raoul is at once interested. He releases
text: her hands and permits her to tell him of the past.
text: She leads him off scene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT.
dialog: Christine leads Raoul to the little arbor on the
text: right. Both sit down upon the moss covered bench.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP RAOUL AND CHRISTINE.
dialog: 
dialog: He is sorry for the pain he has caused her. He
text: begs her forgiveness and tries to take her into
text: his arms. She repulses him gently. The moment is
dialog: too serious for this. The tears trickle down her
dialog: cheek as she begins to speak:
dialog: 
dialog: "YOU REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE WERE
dialog: CHILDREN, MY FATHER TOLD US OF THE
scene_heading: ANGEL OF MUSIC...HOW WHEN HE VISITED
dialog: PEOPLE, THOSE PEOPLE HAD GENIUS?"

scene_heading: SEMI CLOSE UP OF CHRISTINE & RAOUL.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "IT WAS HIS VOICE YOU HEARD. HE
text: VISITS ME NIGHTLY IN MY DRESSING
dialog: ROOM TO GIVE ME MUSIC LESSONS."
text: BACK: Raoul bursts out laughing - a mad laugh -
text: and to Christine, a rude, insulting laugh. She
text: draws away from him with a hostile air. He tells
dialog: her with intensity:
dialog: "CHRISTINE SOMEBODY IS MAKING A
dialog: GAME OF YOU."
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK: She cries out at him and her eyes flash.
text: She is deeply hurt. She thinks that he does not

text: to fade and long shadows creep out into the garden.
text: Raoul is sitting in the little alcove just where
text: he was left. He is downcast and gloomy. His

text: opens - The door to the Inn and he arises. Slowly
text: the door opens and Christine enters, dressed all in
text: white. Her eyes are fixed and look into space. She

dialog: mood that she entered. Raoul's eyes follow Christine
text: for a second. Then again he begins to search for
dialog: the source of the music with his eyes. He
text: thinks he hears a noise in the direction of the bone
dialog: heap and he takes two or three steps in this
dialog: direction.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 246.			ANOTHER SHOT. BLUE.

dialog: look at each other.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP RAOUL & PERSIAN AMBER.
text: The two men stop and look at each other, just for
dialog: an instant, one look, but in that look the Persian
dialog: expresses a friendly compassion for Raoul. The
text: Persian then passes on toward the stage; Raoul
text: looks after him. It strikes Raoul with sudden
dialog: force that perhaps this Persian is Christine's
dialog: Angel of Music. Raoul shows his suspicions and
text: again turns toward Christine's dressing room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR...AMBER.
dialog: 
text: Raoul raps at Christine's door. As there is no

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM AMBER
text: Raoul enters and finds a gas light burning but

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: in a great emotion for the new Marguerite. After
dialog: the French style, they are wild with acclaim.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM AMBER
dialog: 
text: This is a very long shot. The curtains at the

scene_heading: INT. CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM
dialog: 
dialog: Raoul becoming angrier every moment. Then he
text: arises. He will go. As he moves to the door, he
dialog: stops as he hears:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRESSING ROOM CORRIDOR.
dialog: 
text: As Christine comes happily down the corridor,
dialog: her arms laden with flowers and accompanied
dialog: by a group of admiring ballet girls who shower
dialog: her with praise.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Raoul looks about in a panic. Then he decides
text: he will hide. He conceals himself in her closet
dialog: just in time, for the door opens and Christine
text: enters. She waves good-bye to the ballet girls
text: and closing the door, crosses quietly to her
text: mirror, where she hugs the flowers happily.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP AT CLOSET DOOR. AMBER.
dialog: 
text: Raoul is looking at her from the closet. He takes
text: a step forward to go to her, then sees a change in
dialog: her which causes him to pause.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP CHRISTINE...AMBER
dialog: 
text: A strangeness has come over Christine. She
text: raises her head in an attitude of listening. Her
text: eyes seem to be fixed upon space.
dialog: 
text: PASSAGE WAY BACK OF MIRROR.
text: As the masked Phantom plays his violin.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT IN CLOSET.
dialog: 
text: Raoul is suspicious yet puzzled. He feels that he
text: is about to witness the proof of her perfidy.
text: He watches intently.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE UP OF CHRISTINE BEFORE MIRROR.
dialog: 
text: She stretches out her arms toward the mirror and
dialog: with an exalted look, says:
dialog: 
dialog: "I AM HERE, ANGEL OF MUSIC."
dialog: 
text: BACK: The glass begins to quiver. A dozen images
dialog: of Christine are seen, all quivering. Christine
text: herself is terrified. She gropes blindly at
text: a long white drape hanging beside the mirror.
text: The terrified Christine disappears through the mirror
text: and is gone with the mirror hanging and the
text: torn drape with her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER
dialog: 
text: Raoul runs into the room from the closet. He
text: pounds at the glass with his fists. He tries to
text: move it. He strikes at the walls wildly. Then,
text: worn out, empty-brained, he takes up a chair and
text: with all his strength, hurls it at the mirror.
text: The chair is shattered and the mirror uninjured.
text: Then exhausted, he sinks down upon the couch and
text: buries his face in his hands.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY. BACK OF MIRROR (FAINT GREEN)
dialog: 
text: Christine finds herself in a gloomy passage
text: lighted by a single ray of light which comes
text: from some unseen source. Christine clutches the
text: drapes - bewildered and terrified - but she does
text: not cry out. She looks ahead of her in the
dialog: direction of the improvised runway, but she does
text: not look directly downward. Then she turns to
dialog: the mysterious door thru which she has just
text: entered. Near her from below a long arm is
text: extended into the scene. The fingers of the hand
dialog: are held close together, stiff and straight. The
dialog: hand itself is not made up for a skeleton's hand,
dialog: but merely to suggest one slightly. Then, without
text: a step, the figure of Erick moves upward into
dialog: scene, without motion on his part as if he were
text: being lifted upon an elevator. Erick wears
text: a black mask covering his eyes and nose. The
dialog: eyes seem to be two black holes. The part of
dialog: the face that is visible, the chin and the
dialog: mouth, is hideous. There is practically no
text: hair on the head. He is dressed all in black,
dialog: his own peculiar fashion of evening
text: clothes. The whole is covered by a long black
dialog: cloak.
dialog: 
text: Erick extends his hand and grasps Christine by
text: the wrist. She stands motionless, burned to
text: stone, but does not turn her eyes upon him yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A STONE COLD HAND THAT
speaker_heading: SMELLED OF DEATH!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK: Christine screams in sudden hysterical
text: terror and looks up into his face. She screams
text: and begins to fight him hysterically. This
dialog: scene is played very rapidly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT. FAINT GREEN
text: This shot shows an improvised runway with the
text: exit in the left f.g. In the b.g. can be seen
dialog: the machinery of the mirror, the two counter-
text: pieces, etc. One of Erick's feet is still
text: resting upon one of the counterpieces to explain
dialog: how he came to be elevated into the picture.
text: He rode up upon the moving counterpiece.
text: Christine is fighting him hysterically. He takes
text: her bodily in his arms. The drape is partially
dialog: folded about her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE UP ERICK & CHRISTINE. FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
text: As Christine struggles and screams, Erick's
text: skeleton hand closes over her mouth. When her
text: horrified eyes catch sight of Erick's face
text: close to hers, she partially swoons but does not
dialog: entirely lose consciousness. (This screaming is
dialog: employed to key the scene down so that it can
text: again be keyed up when Christine enters Erick's
dialog: abode.) There must be this transition here,
dialog: because if Christine continues to oppose
dialog: Erick, she would not sit willingly upon the
text: white stallion nor row quietly in his arms in
dialog: the boat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: A LONGER SHOT. FAINT GREEN.
text: Christine in his arms, Erick sweeps over the
text: improvised runway with her and exits to the left.
text: The long drape is floating after them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE IN CELLAR. FAINT GREEN.
dialog: 
text: Erick swoops in on the bridge from the right,
text: carrying Christine, the drape floating behind
text: them. Christine is pliable in his arms,
text: half in a swoon. Christine is reluctant. Erick exits
text: with her to the left. The scene changes by employ-
text: ing a traveling iris. As one picture irises out
dialog: of one corner,
text: the next simultaneously irises in another.
text: Thus there is not an instant of blank screen.
dialog: These irises should always travel in the
dialog: direction of the action. (It is suggested
dialog: that in each of these lapses, the fade-outs
dialog: be taken three ways, by lap dissolving, fading
dialog: and the moving iris.)
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR BLANK CORRIDOR. FAINT GREEN.
speaker_heading: MOVING IRIS IN
dialog: 
dialog: Caesar, the great white stallion is tethered
text: here and beside him upon the floor is a lantern.
dialog: With a gliding motion, Erick, Christine in his
text: arms, moves to the horse. As he lifts her upon
text: the horse's back, Christine mildly resists, but
text: fixes herself upon the horse, and remains there.
text: Erick takes up the lantern and leads the horse
text: out, the long drape making a picture.

dialog: 
scene_heading: KEY SET FOR EXPLANATION SHADOW EFFECT. FAINT GREEN

scene_heading: CROSS SECTION SHOT OF THREE CELLARS. FAINT GREEN.
speaker_heading: MOVING IRIS IN.
dialog: 
dialog: This shows diagonal runways leading from one
dialog: cellar to another. Erick leading the horse
dialog: carrying Christine, is in the middle cellar
text: of the three. He leads the horse around the
text: turn and starts down the runway toward the
text: bottom cellar. MOVING IRIS OUT.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ON LAKE #1 FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
text: This first shot is looking from the distance
text: over the still waters to the approach in the
dialog: b.g. Behind the boat and the landing place,
dialog: there is quite a deep view into the cellar
dialog: approach. This is for the end drama with the
text: mob. A boat, moored in front of this approach,
dialog: has a fantastic shape, say a Venetian line, and
dialog: is painted black.
dialog: 
dialog: Erick enters leading horse. This is all in b.g.
text: He places the light in the boat, takes Christine
text: in his arms and as he does so, the horse exits as
text: if by habit. Erick steps into the boat with
text: Christine and the drape. With his free hand, he
text: takes a long pole and gives the boat one shove. He
text: glides toward the camera into the darkness, the
text: drape floating upon the water in its wake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAKE SHOT NO.2 FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
dialog: This is the big lake shot. This shoots from the
text: light into the darkness. The boat glides in from
text: the darkness, the figure in it motionless. The
text: boat glides up to two or three stone steps before
text: a deep stone casemented door in the masonry on
text: the left. The boat comes to a stop before the
text: steps. Erick pulls a ring attached to a heavy
text: chain, hanging from a hole in the masonry. The
text: heavy door swings open and Erick and Christine
text: is lying in his arms as a flood of dazzling light
text: shows she is in his arms limply and without any
dialog: movement of resistance. She is like one in a dream or
text: stupor. Erick carries her from the boat through
dialog: the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM. AMBER
dialog: Following are the elements in this room for
dialog: the action:
dialog: 
dialog: 1- Opening from it thru a bread vaulted opening
dialog: is a music room in which is an organ, violin,
dialog: musician's composing stand.
dialog: 
dialog: 2- The door to the lake landing.
dialog: 
dialog: 3- The door to Erick's bedroom.
dialog: 
text: 4- A short flight of steps leading up to a
text: screened opening leading to the torture chamber.
dialog: 
dialog: 5 - A Spanish chest which contains: the Cricket
dialog: and the Grasshopper.
dialog: 
text: 6 - A trap door on the floor opening upon steps
dialog: leading into the cellar.
dialog: 7 - The hidden opening to Erick's secret passage
dialog: and stairs by which Erick leaves the house by a
dialog: route other than by the lake.
text: 8 - A sounding device upon the wall.
dialog: 
dialog: This room is artistically arranged.
dialog: This suite of rooms is in the very foundation of
dialog: the opera house. Thousands of tons of masonry is
text: above and are being upheld by the arches and walls
dialog: of the room. There is nothing of fantasy in the
dialog: actual lines and construction of the suite. The
dialog: fantastic is applied by Erick's hand in the
dialog: lighting, furnishings and draperies.
dialog: 
dialog: Artistically arranged with many variations of
dialog: freshly cut flowers. Each of the furnishings
dialog: is old-fashioned, the idea being that it belonged
dialog: to Erick's mother. The couch is very light,
dialog: much higher than an ordinary couch.
dialog: 
text: Erick enters carrying Christine. He crosses the
text: room to the high couch and gently places her upon
text: it. He then returns to the door and closes it.
text: Christine's stupor is giving way to astonishment
text: and bewilderment. She begins to look at the
text: strange room when Erick returns to her. She still
dialog: is not sufficiently recovered from her stupor to
text: be startled and shocked by Erick's approach. He
text: observes her for an instant with folded arms in an
dialog: attitude of humility.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP ERICK & CHRISTINE AMBER
text: Slowly Erick sinks to his knees upon a footstool.
text: He is most abject and humble. He touches the
text: fold of her dress. He presses it to his breast
text: and then to his lips. Christine is watching him
text: as one hypnotized. Then she screams a sudden
text: and terrified scream. She springs from the couch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT. AMBER
dialog: 
text: In the center of the room Christine hesitates,
text: then wildly runs out through the door leading
text: to Erick's bed chamber. Without haste and in
dialog: humility, he moves after her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S BED CHAMBER. AMBER
dialog: 
text: The walls and the low ceiling are hung in black.
text: In the middle of the room there is a canopy from
text: which hangs curtains of red brocaded stuff. Under
text: this canopy there is an open coffin, an elaborate
text: affair lined with wuffed silk. It is fantastic
text: but must look like a coffin - the lid is open.
text: When Christine enters the coffin is not seen.
text: She enters and stands frozen to the spot. Her
text: wildness gives way to a dumb terror. The
text: camera pans revealing the coffin and the canopy,
text: but keeping Christine in the scene. Erick enters
text: to her side in a quiet humble way. Indicating
dialog: the coffin, he tells her in a matter-of-fact way:
dialog: "THIS IS WHERE I SLEEP."
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK: She looks at him with quiet horror and
text: incredulity. She begins to get an idea. It begins
dialog: to force itself upon her. Erick continues:
dialog: "ONE HAS TO GET USED TO EVERYTHING
text: IN LIFE, NEVER TO ETERNITY."
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AND ERICK. AMBER
text: The shot cuts out the coffin. Christine's
text: terrified eyes are now fastened intently upon
dialog: Erick's face. The thought that has forced
text: itself upon her, is a revelation to her. She
dialog: cries at him with loathing:
dialog: 
dialog: "YOU ARE NOT THE ANGEL OF MUSIC....
dialog: YOU ARE THE OPERA GHOST!"
dialog: 
text: BACK: Erick ignores this. He indicates toward
dialog: the coffin, "This is not a pleasant sight for you.
dialog: You had better go into the next room."
dialog: Christine here begins a transition. From the
dialog: positive, assuming attitude, one of hopelessness
text: and fear begins to envelope her. She begins
dialog: to tremble and without removing her eyes from
text: his face, backs into the drawing room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER.
dialog: 
text: Christine enters from Erick's bed chamber to the
text: center of the room. She is now a pathetic,
dialog: helpless little figure, hopeless, without under-
dialog: standing of what is to happen to her and trembling
text: with fear. Erick enters from his bedchamber and
text: goes to her with a humble stoop of the shoulders.
text: He stands before her an instant in an abject attitude.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERIK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER
dialog: Erick seems to fully understand her attitude. He
dialog: tells her humbly:
dialog: 
dialog: "CHRISTINE, YOU MUST KNOW THE TRUTH.
dialog: I'M NOT A GHOST...NOR AN ANGEL OF
dialog: MUSIC..."
dialog: 
text: BACK: She is wide-eyed and motionless and remains
dialog: this way throughout the scene. Erick continues
dialog: sadly:
dialog: 
dialog: "JUST A MAN OF FLESH AND BLOOD....
dialog: I AM ERICK!"
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK: Christine is stunned by this knowledge
text: for she recognizes the voice. She says angrily
dialog: though frightened:
dialog: 
dialog: "IF YOU ARE HUMAN, REMOVE THAT MASK
dialog: SO THAT I MAY SEE YOUR FACE."
dialog: 
text: BACK: Erik recoils in alarm and takes a step
dialog: backward.
speaker_heading: C.V. ERIK.
dialog: 
text: His face and frame tremble with emotion as he answers
dialog:

dialog: UNLESS YOU RESIGN YOURSELF TO THE
speaker_heading: FATE OF NEVER AGAIN SEEING THE
speaker_heading: LIGHT OF DAY"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ERIK'S DRAWING ROOM.
dialog: 
text: Christine is terrified...she becomes hysterical
text: and sinking to her knees, pleads with him to
dialog: release her - to take her home. Instead, Erik
text: gazes at her with folded arms and he says with
dialog: tragic sadness:
dialog: 
dialog: "I LOVE YOU CHRISTINE....I HAVE
dialog: BROUGHT YOU HERE A PRISONER..."
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK: There is a movement of Christine's eyes,
dialog: something to indicate terrible suspense...He
dialog: continues the title, humbly:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "...FOR LOVE!"
dialog: 
text: BACK: Christine's hands go to her temples. She
text: totters an instant - then swoons. As she falls,
text: he catches her in his arms and allows her to
text: sink gently to the floor. He kneels beside her
text: and sways and moans and beats his chest and
text: groveling, he kisses the hem of her garment.
text: Slowly then Christine regains consciousness. She
text: is at first terrified; then as he sees the
dialog: tragic outpouring of a sublime love, she can only
dialog: feel pity for the strange creature who weeps and
text: beats his breast. When Erik sees she is
text: conscious, he seizes her hands and covers them
text: with burning kisses. Christine draws away and
dialog: says:
dialog: 
dialog: "I CAN ONLY DESPISE YOU, IF YOU
text: HOLD ME HERE AGAINST MY WILL."
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: C.V. OF ERIK
dialog: As he realizes that there is truth in her
dialog: statement. The fear of losing her is as

dialog: "AT THE END OF FIVE DAYS, YOU SHALL
scene_heading: BE FREE....FEAR NOT. FOR HE WHO
dialog: WORSHIPS YOU I AS I DO, ALSO RESPECTS!"
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: INT CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM...AMBER
dialog: 
text: The room is dimly lighted and all that is seen
text: is the dim outline of a bed and a door. This is
dialog: an extraordinary bed, a something dramatic, something
dialog: that does not exist. Erik enters with Christine
text: and places her gently upon the bed. He stands
text: for an instant in the doorway in silhouette and
text: looks at her, then exits and closes the door.
text: Christine arises to a sitting position.

dialog: "OH HOW I HATE RAOUL. BUT HE'LL NEVER
dialog: HAVE YOU CHRISTINE****NOT IN THIS LIFE!"
dialog: 
text: BACK: Erick moves closer to Christine as if he is
text: going to take her in his arms--she throws up her
dialog: hands to warn him off. This brings Christine to
dialog: herself. Somethings has been revealed and it sha-
dialog: dows the tone of the scene. Up to this moment Chris-
dialog: tine had been hypnotized by his music. The spell
text: of the music now dispelled and she begins to look
dialog: at the man with curiosity and increasing antagonism--
text: then as his horrid face comes closer and closer, she
text: suddenly seizes the mask and tears it from his face--
text: then repelled against the wall with a scream of terror
text: and revulsion. Facing Christine is a death's head
dialog: that is alive with four black holes for its eyes,
text: nose and mouth, a skin pallid and yellow--Erick utters
text: a terrible cry of grief, despair and rage, then towers
text: over her, hissing words and curses upon her.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog:

text: Christine shrinks from him and falls, upon her knees.
text: Erick follows her, towers over her and cries:

dialog: "FEAST YOUR EYES, GLUT YOUR SOUL ON MY

dialog: 
text: BACK: Christine lifts her arms and begs for mercy.
text: He grabs her and draws her to him, brutally, twist-

dialog: 
text: BACK: He seizes her by the hands and digs them into
text: his awful face. He tears his flesh with her hands
dialog: and cries:
dialog: "KNOW THAT I AM BUILT OF DEATH FROM
dialog: HEAD TO FOOT.. THAT IT IS A CORPSE
dialog: THAT LOVES AND ADORES YOU!"
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK: Christine is so horrified and aghast that, though
text: she speaks, her words are sobs, heaving sobs. Erick
text: releases her and goes down at her with his terrible face
text: contorted with a hideous grin, then he stops,
text: pulls backward laughing wildly. Her hair is lopsided
text: and streaming over her shoulder. Torn by uncontrolled
text: hysteria, tears, she raises to him appealing and makes
text: two steps forward, upon her knees, begging forgiveness
dialog: for the terrible thing she has done. He is towering
text: over her with folded arms, his face slowly loosing
text: his hideous grin and mourning convulsively as the
text: tragedy of his love comes over him. Then he sobs
dialog: piteously.
dialog: 
dialog: "NOW THAT YOU KNOW MY HIDEOUSNESS,
dialog: YOU WOULD NEVER COME BACK, IF I LET
dialog: YOU GO FREE --THEREFORE I CRY FOR YOU---
dialog: BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE ME AGAIN."
dialog: 
dialog:

text: brother in contempt for his weak and silly infatuation.
text: The door opens and a servant with a message enters
dialog: and carries it to Raoul --Raoul takes it without

text: crumples the message in his fist---a look of intense
text: anger spreads over his face--he strides over to his

dialog:

dialog: are so filled up with people that it is almost a
dialog: jam--Although most of the people are costumed,
dialog: many are in evening dress and wear opera masks.
text: It is a scene of noise, laughter and color, gaiety
text: and emotion. On the left side of the staircase,
text: where it takes a left angle turn, Raoul is walking.
text: He is masked in evening dress and wears a black

dialog: 
text: Raoul hurries through the crowd following Christine
dialog: and they exit. The moment they are out of the picture

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRAND STAIRCASE NO 1 PRIZMA
dialog: 
text: This is a crop shot at the right staircase. The hush
dialog: has extended to all the people in the scene. All
dialog: motion has died out except at the entrance to the
text: right of the staircase. There is a stir, a shrinking
dialog: away of the people, there. The Red Death creeps into
text: the picture from the corridor. It is a man dressed in
text: all scarlet, with a huge hat and feathers, on the top
text: of a wonderful death's head. From his shoulder hangs
text: an immense red velvet cloak, which trails along the
text: floor like a King's train. It is plainly to be seen

dialog: 
text: The noise and the gaiety is at its height. A number of
dialog: masked ballet girls are in evidence. Florine enters
text: from the center door. He is costumed as a swash-
dialog: buckling pirate, the terror of the spanish Main. We
text: see he wears a broadsword and all the other finery.
dialog: His mask has the habit of falling off. Sometimes
text: it is on his chin like a beard and at other times on
text: his forehead. He enters swaggering and his broad
text: sword gets mixed up in his legs thereby attracting
dialog: attention.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP OF FLORINE...PRIZMA
dialog: 
text: As he untangles his broadsword his masked face
text: falls off and he quietly fastens it on again.

dialog: 
text: MED. CLOSE UP CENTER DOOR LEADING TO LANDING OF STAIRS
dialog: 
dialog: Florine has not been quick enough with his mask how-
dialog: ever. The ballet girls have recognized him. They all
dialog: are friends of his and like teasing and playing around
text: with him. Two of them take him, each by the arm and
text: lightly kid with him for an instant, then leads him
text: out to the left. All the while Florine is swashing
dialog: buckling, taking joy in enacting the role of a cut
dialog: throat.
dialog: 
text: MED CLOSE UP OF RED DEATH..AND SHRINKING PEOPLE
text: As the Red Death comes into scene. Florine enters

text: furious gasps, cries out in pain and terror and is
dialog: flung onto the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MED C.V. IN CROWD
dialog: 
text: As Florine lands on the floor- he picks himself up---
dialog: his dignity has suffered, he will have revenge---
text: he draws his sword and taking off his mask challenges
text: him to come out and fight like a man. He fights the
dialog: air with his sword...at that instant a man costumed
text: as a jester steps up and taps Florine's shoulder.
text: As Florine turns, the jester takes off his mask re-
dialog: vealing the funeral face of the Persian, who in a
dialog: hushed voice of horror indicates "Do you know what
dialog: this is?" Florine is very sober. He answers "No
dialog: Sir." The hushed voice tells him:
dialog: 
dialog: "THAT WAS THE OPERA GHOST!"
dialog: 
text: BACK: Florine stands perfectly still and his eyes
text: widen. Florine gives a low moan and swoons. All is
dialog: excitement - some run out. The girls fan him with
dialog: their skirts, smelling salts are produced and they
text: try to revive him. Someone enters with a glass of
dialog: water.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP OF GROUP AND FLORINE AMBER
dialog: 
text: The glass of water is dashed in his face. Florine
text: opens his eyes and shakes his head to shake off the
text: water. He looks around the room. Florine gets to
text: his feet, looks quickly and tears out of the picture
dialog: down the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT GRAND STAIRCASE #1 PRIZMA
dialog: This is the same shot of the staircase. The crowd
dialog: is gayer and noisier than before. There is a commotion
text: at the upper left hand entrance to the staircase.
text: An aisle is made and Florine runs in fleeing for his
text: life. When he reaches the turn on the platform, he
text: gets his legs tangled up with his broadsword and he
text: falls, but quickly regains his feet and dashes down
dialog: the stairs. It is suggested that this scene be not
dialog: under speed. About 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHOOTING INTO GALLERY ...PRIZMA
dialog: 
text: This is the first opening on the left of the second
text: gallery. There in the gallery all are looking down
text: at the ghost. Raoul, following Christine, passes
text: through from left to right. Christine looks down
text: and sees the ghost, then she clutches at Raoul to
dialog: keep him from looking down on the staircase. They
dialog: pass out to the right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHOOTING INTO GALLERY PRIZMA
dialog: 
text: This is the second opening of the second gallery.
text: The onlookers are motionless looking down over the
dialog: rail. Raoul and Christine enter from the Left.
dialog: Raoul's curiosity overcomes Christine's apprehension
text: although she is pulling at his sleeve. Raoul leans over
text: the rail and looks down. Christine is terrified that
dialog: the Phantom will recognize Raoul with her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHOOTING AGAINST THE GRAND STAIR CASE PRIZMA
dialog: 
dialog: The Red Death has almost reached the foot of the

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP OF RAOUL AND CHRISTINE PRIZMA
dialog: 
text: They are at the rail in the center opening in
dialog: the second gallery. Christine sees that the Red Death
dialog: has seen her and Raoul. Her action shows that there
text: is fear and excitement. She clutches him by the sleeve
text: and half drags him through the door in the rear which
text: reveals a stairway going upward.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAND STAIRCASE #2 PRIZMA
dialog: The Red Death is looking upward. We now see him
dialog: creep up the grand staircase, much more rapidly than
text: he came down, the crowd parting before him, making
text: an aisle. When he reaches the landing he turns to
dialog: the left.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHOOTING REVERSE DOWN UPON GRAND STAIRCASE PRIZMA
dialog: 
text: This shows all eyes looking toward the left staircase.
text: There is a beginning of fluttering relief and relax-
text: ation. Then the crowd begins to mix and the gaiety
dialog: is resumed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT FIRST CORRIDOR AMBER
dialog: 
text: This is an overhead corridor. A flight of stairs in
dialog: the f.g. leads from below. In the b.g. is a single
text: staircase leading upward. The entrance to the stair
text: case is a high area, almost into the top of the ceiling
dialog: so that the camera while taking in the people looks a
dialog: long distance up the stairs. If a person were coming
dialog: down these stairs, their lower extremities would be
dialog: seen some time before the full figure. In the f.g.
text: there is a door covered with a portierre. Immediately
dialog: beyond this portierre is a full sized mirror. There
dialog: is a door and number of other exits. Raoul and
text: Christine enter from below. She has Raoul by the arm
text: and almost drags him along. Raoul is extrapolating
dialog: with her excitedly - He wants to know what all the
dialog: mad rushing about is for.
dialog: 
dialog: Christine has the manner of a hunted person. Hardly
dialog: listening to Raoul's excited cry for an explanation
text: she pauses at the portierres and listens.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AND RAOUL AMBER
dialog: 
text: She listens pushes aside the portierres and peers
dialog: up the stairs then she whispers:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "HE MUST HAVE GONE HIGHER UP."
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK: Raoul is baffled, amazed, impatient for an ex-
dialog: planation. Christine listens at the portierre, this
text: time with sudden alarm. This time she speaks directly
dialog: at Raoul.
dialog: 
dialog: "HE IS COMING DOWN AGAIN."
text: BACK: She grabs Raoul's arm and pulls him up the steps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT OVER HEAD CORRIDOR #2 AMBER
dialog: 
text: A flight of stairs leads into this from below and
dialog: another flight leads upward. There are three or
dialog: four exits in this set. Christine and Raoul enter
text: from below. Christine is still pulling at his arm.
text: He will go no further. He glances down the steps that
dialog: they have just mounted.
scene_heading: SHOOTING DOWN NARROW STAIRWAY
dialog: 
dialog: This is shooting in the corridor number one. The
text: camera sees a crimson cloak and a slippered foot
dialog: disappear around the corner of the passage. Sug-
dialog: gesting that the phantom has seen Raoul's movement and
text: is dodging out of sight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT. CORRIDOR #2 AMBER
speaker_heading: MED CLOSE UP RAOUL AND CHRISTINE
dialog: 
dialog: So this is the sum of Christine's fears. This is
text: an object for Raoul's anger. He moves towards the stair
dialog: with a purpose of provoking this phantom and laying
text: hands upon him. Christine is thrown into near
text: hysterics. She clutches at Raoul's arm. He now has
text: one foot upon the stairs. He is drawing away from
text: her and in so doing he pulls her to her knees.
text: Pleading she cries at him.
dialog: 
dialog: "DON'T DON'T DON'T AS I LOVE YOU,
dialog: RAOUL. IT WILL MEAN YOUR LIFE AND MINE"
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK: Raoul undergoes a complete transition. What
text: she has said hits him violently and with great weight.
text: He sees her before him a helpless pathetic little
dialog: figure. He feels the utmost pity and love for her.
text: Gently he takes her by the elbow and lifts her to her
dialog: feet. She indicates to him weakly "Come"
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER
dialog: 
text: This time he follows her willingly and she hastily
dialog: leads the way still upward.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT GARRET SET ADJOINING ROOM ROOF BLUE

scene_heading: EXT AT ENTRANCE ON ROOF...BLUE
dialog: Christine and Raoul enter from garret set. Christine
dialog: is greatly relieved. She breathes in the freedom of
text: the night air and as she removes her mask Raoul
dialog: removes his mask and she tells him:
dialog: 
dialog: "BELOW IS HIS WORLD ABOVE IT OURS."
dialog: 
text: BACK: In a gray way Raoul pauses and presses her for
text: an explanation. She becomes at once tragic and appre-
text: hensive. She indicates for him to come. He follows
dialog: her out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT ROOF AT FOOT OF APOLLO'S LYRE...BLUE
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: SEMI CLOSE UP OF RAOUL AND CHRISTINE...BLUE
dialog: 
dialog: Both indicate that they feel safe here. Raoul
text: faces her questioningly. He is waiting for her
dialog: to answer the many doubts that trouble on his lips.
text: She draws close to him, confident that he will
dialog: believe him. She begins:
dialog: 
dialog: "I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING RAOUL.
dialog: PITY ME PRAY FOR ME."
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK: Raoul gasps in amazement and suspicion
text: and softens as she begins to cry gently. She continues:
dialog: 
dialog: "WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE VIOLIN AND
scene_heading: THE BEAUTIFUL VOICE IN MY DRESSING ROOM
dialog: I BELIEVED IT TO BE THE ANGEL OF MUSIC."

dialog: "FOR FIVE DAYS UNTIL THIS AFTER NOON
dialog: I WAS HELD PRISONER IN HIS CHAMBER OF

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "HE FILLS ME WITH HORROR YET I CANNOT

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK: Then in a hushed way as if she were hardly speak-

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "HE MADE ME PROMISE THAT I WOULD NEVER
dialog: FORSAKE HIM. THAT I WOULD ALWAYS COME
dialog: BACK TO HIM."
dialog: 
text: BACK: Raoul is moody and depressed. He is keeping
dialog: his eyes averted. Where one might expect to see anger
text: there is none. Raoul is burning up inside with
dialog: jealousy - guilty jealousy. Christine has been so
dialog: engrossed in her terrible story that she has not
dialog: understood his attitude. She is shocked now as an
text: understanding of Raoul's suspicions comes to her.
text: Her lips tremble and she feels helpless and alone.
text: She is almost at the point of tears. She tries to get
text: his eyes but he averts them. She touches him upon
dialog: the arm and speaks with appeal:
dialog: 
dialog: "RAOUL DO YOU THINK THAT I AM NOT
dialog: A GOOD WOMAN? DO YOU NOT LOVE ME?"
dialog: BACK: This challenge startles Raoul. He is
text: ashamed of himself. He takes both of her hands and
dialog: speaks with fervor:
dialog: 
dialog: "I LOVE YOU CHRISTINE..I WANT YOU TO
dialog: GO AWAY WITH ME TONIGHT WHERE WE CAN
text: BE MARRIED AND ENJOY OUR LOVE."
dialog: 
text: BACK: The tremble vanishes from her face and her

dialog: strangler's lasso. The multiple reflections of the
dialog: tree gives the effect of a forest, in the mirrors.
dialog: Out of reach of anyone is the torture chamber and
text: out of the picture in the right top wall is an
text: aperture opening into Erick's living room, an opening
dialog: through which a person in the living room can see into
dialog: the torture chamber. Ben Carre is working out the
dialog: details of this chamber.
dialog: 
dialog: There is no effect of a reflected forest until
text: Erick turns on the overhead lights. The dark lantern
dialog: would not cause those multiple reflections. The
text: Persian gets to his feet, turns lantern to
text: mirrors and feels them. Then examines iron tree and
dialog: lasso - turns to Raoul, recovering from fall and says:
dialog: "WE HAVE DROPPED INTO ONE OF THE
text: TORTURE CHAMBERS OF THE OLD COMMUNE.
speaker_heading: IF ERICK DISCOVERS US, MAY GOD HAVE
dialog: MERCY ON OUR SOULS!"
dialog: 
text: BACK: Raoul's reaction is horror. Suddenly both men
text: are startled and look up and to the right. They
text: hear Erick's voice. Raoul is thrown into great
text: terror and opens his mouth to cry out but the Persian
text: grabs Raoul and puts his hand over Raoul's mouth.

dialog: of heavy material closely woven from wire and
text: locked with a fancy weird sort of padlock. Erick is
dialog: standing below Christine, Erick is making love to
text: her, in his way, and Christine is flattened against
text: the wall crying hysterically.
text: Erick is not touching her but close to and below
dialog: her he tells her:
dialog: 
dialog: "YOU SHALL BE THE HAPPIEST OF
dialog: WOMEN...WE WILL SING BY OURSELVES

text: BACK: Christine shrinks from him, shrinks away

dialog:

speaker_heading: CLOSE UP RAOUL AND THE PERSIAN
text: Raoul is in agony and struggles with the Persian
dialog: who tries to get it over to him that it will mean his

text: now begins to feel the walls for the hidden spring
dialog: that will release them.
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S LIVING ROOM ...AMBER...MED. CLOSE UP
speaker_heading: OF ERICK AND CHRISTINE
dialog: 
text: Christine looks up terribly startled at a resounding
text: clang. Erick too is startled into a dramatic tension.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE OF QUEER SOUNDING DEVICE...AMBER
dialog: This is a weird, oriental, beautifully tooled
dialog: affair. There are three bars such as are used in
text: chimes. An arm about 18 inches long systematically
dialog: strikes the chimes - all three at once. This
text: sounding device is placed in a prominent place in
dialog: the room and continues striking regularly through
dialog: the next number of scenes. This is for the dramatic
dialog: affect of its stopping at the proper moment.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AND ERICK. AMBER
dialog: 
dialog: Erick, realizes that opposition is now at hand and
text: a satanic smile overspreads his horrible face,
dialog: mockingly he tells Christine:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "SOMEBODY IS RINGING! WE
dialog: HAVE CALLERS!"
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK: Christine's first reaction is one of relief.
text: Help is at hand. Then almost instantly she is
dialog: thrown into anguish. Her lips form the name "Raoul"
text: Erick studies her for an instant and then moves out.
dialog: Swiftly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT...AMBER
dialog: 
text: The arm is rhythmically falling upon the chime.
text: Erick moves to a beautiful throw hanging over the
text: back of a chair, sweeps it off. Swiftly he begins
dialog: to bind Christine to the center pillar.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE...AMBER
dialog: 
text: She offers no resistance. The throw passes around
text: Christine's waist and is tied on the side of the pillar
dialog: opposite Christine. Erick tells her hurriedly:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "FORGIVE ME...THIS IS TO SAVE YOU
speaker_heading: FROM HARMING YOURSELF."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONG SHOT. AMBER
text: The chimes are sounding. Erick now sweeps from the
text: room, leaving by the door which leads to the lake.
text: He closes the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: LAKE SET LOOKING FROM ERICK'S ROOM FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
text: The boat is discovered here. Erick enters from
text: his drawing room. From a rack he takes up a metal
text: tube, the shape of a reed, about four feet long
dialog: and less than half an inch in diameter. Erick
dialog: puts one end of this tube in his mouth and swiftly
text: walks down into the water. As he walks he goes down
text: and down until his head disappears and only the
dialog: ripple caused by the end of the gliding reed is
text: seen. This ripple moves away with remarkable swiftness.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE FIRST LAKE SET...FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
text: Philippe is standing at the boat landing. He has

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER...FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
dialog: Raoul and the Persian are listening to make sure
dialog: that Erick has gone, then, before the Persian can

text: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE LASHED TO THE CENTER PILLAR
text: Christine hears Raoul's agonized cry, answers it
dialog: and gives away to fear for Raoul.
scene_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER...FAINT GREEN.
dialog: 
dialog: Raoul is crying out - wild inarticulate things
dialog: to Christine - The Persian grasps him by the
dialog: wrist and sternly indicates for him to keep
dialog: quiet. The Persian addresses himself toward
dialog: the overhead window:
dialog: 
text: "WE ARE IN THE TORTURE CHAMBER.
text: THE DOOR IS IN THE WALL FROM WHICH

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT RICK'S LIVING ROOM...AMBER
text: A shot of Christine taking in the drape at the
text: head of the little stairs behind the couch.
dialog: Christine hears this title and fires her gaze
text: upon the drape. She cries out that she is bound
text: and begins to struggle with her bonds.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT THE FIRST LAKE SET...FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
text: This is medium closeup of Philippe at the boat landing.
text: Philippe is kneeling, holding up the lantern, peering
text: into the darkness. He shouts Raoul's name. Unseen by
text: Philippe and directly in front of him there is a dis-
text: turbance in the water. The reed-like tube glides in
text: making a V-shaped line of ripples. Then Erick's
text: long arm shoots out of the water and grasps Philippe's
dialog: wrist of the hand that holds the lantern, and the
text: scene is plunged into darkness.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S LIVING ROOM...MED CU CHRISTINE
dialog: 
text: She has worked around to the rear of the pillar within
dialog: reach of the knot. She unloosens the knot
dialog: sufficiently to allow her to slip under the throw
dialog: which has held her prisoner.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LONGER SHOT AMBER
dialog: 
text: Christine flies across the room and runs up the few
text: steps to the door to the torture chamber.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE BEFORE DOOR...AMBER
text: Christine parts the drapes and tries to look
text: through the heavy mesh, but evidently can see
text: nothing. She shakes the door and registers that it
text: is locked. She cries out in distress to the men in
text: the torture chamber that the door is locked.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TORTURE CHAMBER FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
text: The Persian is listening to Christine intently.
text: At the same time he is forcing Raoul to be quiet.
dialog: The Persian tells Christine:
dialog: 
dialog: "THE KEYS ARE IN A CHAMOIS BAG HANGING
speaker_heading: NEAR THE ENTRANCE DOOR."
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
text: This is a shot taking in the entrance door.
text: Christine is before the door to the torture chamber,
text: and the sounding device rhythmically beating. Christine
text: runs down the steps and approaches the entrance door,
dialog: looking for the chamois bag. This bag is not in plain
dialog: view, so that she cannot locate it at a glance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE UP SOUNDING DEVICE. AMBER
dialog: 
text: It continues to strike twice and stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER.
dialog: 
text: Christine is looking at the sounding device.
dialog: With dread anticipation she senses that Erick
text: is returning. She flies back to the center
text: pillar and slips under the throw. She is now
dialog: apparently in the position that Erick left her.
dialog: From this moment Christine begins to act a
dialog: double role. She is now matching her wits against
dialog: Erick's...Above all things she must keep Raoul's
dialog: presence in the torture chamber from Erick.
dialog: 
text: The entrance door opens and Erick enters
text: dripping wet. He closes the door goes to
dialog: Christine and tells her sardonically:
dialog: 
dialog: "MY DEAR. IT IS RAINING CATS
dialog: AND DOGS OUTSIDE."
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER
dialog: 
dialog: Christine is looking at the sounding device
dialog: with dread anticipation - it is still. Her fear
text: is just as apparent as her pretense. She does not
dialog: fail to notice his wet clothes and the mystery
text: behind his absence. Erick now drops his sardonic
dialog: mood which caused the last title. As he releases her
dialog: he tells her:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "COME I WILL PLAY YOU OUR WEDDING MASS.
dialog: YOU CAN TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, IT IS MAG*
speaker_heading: NIFICENT."
dialog: 
dialog: BACK: From this point, Erick seems to forget Christine's
dialog: presence, so absorbed is he in his new purpose. Erick
text: turns away from her toward the organ and Christine
dialog: registers her involved complexity, fear that Erick
dialog: may discover her intention, eagerness to possess the
dialog: chamois bag.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER.
dialog: 
text: Erick sits down at the organ and begins to play
dialog: seeming almost wholly to have forgotten Christine.
text: She works her way toward the entrance door and
text: when Erick does glance her way, she pauses and
text: pretends that she is listening.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AT ENTRANCE DOOR AMBER
dialog: 
dialog: Christine discovers the chamois bag partly concealed
text: behind a drape, up in a little recess. She is at
text: a high tension, she gives Erick a frightened look,
text: then snatches the little bag from its hiding place.
text: Instantly she looks back at Erick in terror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONG SHOT AMBER
dialog: 
dialog: Erick has stopped playing and is looking at Christine
text: in an attitude of alarm. He rises and swiftly strides
text: to her. In an hysterical way she tries to conceal the
dialog: bag.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MED CLOSE UP CHRISTINE & ERICK
dialog: He cries at her in anger:
dialog: "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY BAG? DON'T
dialog: YOU KNOW THAT IS THE BAG OF LIFE AND

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK: Erick forces the bag away from her and she
text: gives a cry of dismay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
text: Raoul and the Persian are listening at a great tension.
text: Raoul gives an unexpected cry of rage - This startles
dialog: the Persian, who indicates with certain horror,
dialog: "He has heard you!"
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
speaker_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE
dialog: 
text: Erick is listening. He has heard Raoul's cry of rage.
dialog: He now understands why Christine wanted the keys.
dialog: He also knows that only for Raoul would Christine
dialog: do as she has. From this moment Erick becomes cruel
text: and Christine combats him on the verge of hysterics.
text: He asks her in a quiet but very dangerous manner:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "DID YOU HEAR, CHRISTINE?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK: "No" she cries "no, I heard nothing."
dialog: Erick tells her quietly but pointedly:
dialog: 
dialog: "YOU ARE LYING."
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT
dialog: 
text: Erick moves swiftly up the few steps to the screened
dialog: opening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AMBER
dialog: 
text: He brushes aside the drapery and discloses the window.
dialog: But he does not so much as look thru it. The screen
text: is set back somewhat and there is an open space between
text: the screen and the wall of the room. Erick puts his
text: hand out of sight in this opening and turns something.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER FAINT GREEN
dialog: From semi-darkness the chamber is flooded with
text: a brilliant, dazzling light from overhead.
dialog: Under the overhead light the single iron tree
dialog: is multiplied into thousands of trees, into a
dialog: forest. Raoul's reaction is astonishment, be-
dialog: wilderment, the Persian's horror - for he knows
dialog: what this means. The torture has begun. The
text: sudden flood of brilliant light causes them to blink.
text: Then Raoul tries to hide his eyes from the brilliant,
dialog: blinding light. The Persian now realizes the necessity
dialog: of searching for the secret spring which he knows
text: to be in the floor. Excitedly he begins to feel over
dialog: the floor with the tips of his fingers, to feel the
text: joints in the glass. Raoul watches him in excited
text: bewilderment. This is a short scene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S ROOM AMBER
dialog: 
text: Erick is now coming down the steps leading to the
dialog: screened opening. Christine senses that Erick
dialog: has put into effect some of his cruel mechanisms.
text: She is becoming frantic in her attempt to carry
text: on her acting. Her composure is palpably nervous
dialog: and forced. Erick pantomimes for her to go up
text: and look thru the screen. She moves mechanically
text: up the steps. Her attitude is entirely false to him.
text: In a mechanical way she parts the drapes concealing
text: the opening. A strong light is apparent back of
dialog: screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AMBER
dialog: 
text: She peers through the screen. There is just the
text: slightest fleeting tremor about her eyes. She
dialog: turns to him with poorly affected surprise and
dialog: tells him:
dialog: 
dialog: "WHY...THERE IS NO ONE THERE!"
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER
dialog: 
text: Christine comes down the steps, trying to affect
text: an air of being nonchalant. Erick steps up to her
dialog: and takes her by the wrist, asking her:
dialog: 
dialog: "NOT EVEN THE LITTLE CHAP YOU
dialog: WERE GOING TO RUN AWAY WITH?"
text: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE AMBER.
dialog: 
text: He holds her with his hollow eye. The terrible
dialog: realization comes over her that Erick knows that
text: Raoul is in the torture Chamber. In a helpless
dialog: automatic way, knows that he knows she is lying.
dialog: She repeats "No! No! Nobody is there!"
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TORTURE CHAMBER AMBER
dialog: 
text: The heat in the chamber has now become intense.
dialog: Both men are perspiring profusely. Excitement
text: approaching panic is overtaking the Persian
text: as he continues his search for the secret spring.
dialog: They are mopping their faces with their handker-
text: chiefs. Raoul tears off his collar and flings it
text: from him. He wants air. He begins to beat at
dialog: the mirrors with his fists and the Persian shows
text: his apprehension for Raoul. He tries to quiet
dialog: Raoul.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXT IN PARIS STREET BLUE
dialog: 
text: (In this scene begins the gathering of the mob, it
dialog: must not have the appearance of an open revolt against
dialog: constituted authority. It is rather the quiet myster-
dialog: ious gathering of about five hundred men, under the
text: very eyes of the police. Until they begin rushing
dialog: wild in the opera, they must do everything to con-
dialog: ceal their designs from the police. Mob psychology
dialog: is only suggested here and allowed to grow to
dialog: dramatic proportions later.)
dialog: This is a general view of the street. The streets
text: are wet. It has just stopped raining. The streets
text: glisten from the lights reflected on the pavement.
text: Only about half the mob is shown here. The men are
dialog: gathering in small groups, not more than ten in a
dialog: group. The groups are so placed as to be near exits
dialog: for a sudden disappearance effect. A nervous buzz
text: of suppressed excitement prevails. The center of
text: the scene is a dark doorway around which the largest
text: group is gathered. Beside the door is a flight of
text: steps leading down into a dark cellar. Standing
dialog: beside this door is Simon with Florine. Mysterious
dialog: packages (torches) the contents of which are not shown
text: to the audience, are passed out of the doorway and
text: instantly secreted under the coats of the receivers.
dialog: The mysterious packages are being distributed among
dialog: the other groups, and in each case are instantly
dialog: secreted.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MED CLOSE UP CENTER GROUP BLUE
dialog: 
text: A fanatical fire shines from Simon's eyes, as he
dialog: directs the distribution of the mysterious packages.
text: The packages are passed out of the doorway. Florine's
text: attention is concentrated upon a deaf man. He is
text: shouting in the man's ear, trying to make him under-
dialog: stand something.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANOTHER SHOT BLUE
dialog: 
text: This is shooting down the street upon the mob.
dialog: In the f.g. is a cross-road. One of the mob is
dialog: picketed on the corner to keep an eye out for
text: the police. A gendarme approaches upon the cross
dialog: street. He will not be in a position to catch
text: sight of the mob until he reaches the corner.
text: The picket spots him.

dialog: 
text: SHOOTING DOWN STREET TOWARD CROSS ROAD BLUE
dialog: 
text: The mob melts and disappears - vanishes. The
dialog: door through which the packages were being passed
text: closes. This leaves Florine alone yelling at the
text: deaf man. The deaf man sees and he too disappears.
text: Florine looks around and finds himself all alone.
text: He runs down into the cellar just as the gendarme
text: rounds the corner and takes a diagonal course
text: across the street. Florine fairly bounces, flies
dialog: out of the cellar. The idea is that he has been
dialog: confronted by something terrible in the
text: cellars - just as rapidly as he comes out. The
text: gendarme, however, does not see him and exits. The
text: door opens, Simon enters and the mob reappears, just
text: as rapidly as it faded away. Florine enters
dialog: from the cellar, sort of creeping up backwards
text: looking into the dark hole with fright. Simon gives
text: an order to move. He conceals a package and gives it
text: to Florine. Florine's package sticks up about a
text: foot back of his head in plain sight. The mob moves.

dialog: Christine is in the position now that one false
dialog: step will cause Raoul's death. If Erick makes love
dialog: to her she cannot tell him flatly "No"
dialog: Therefore she continues her acting, depending upon
text: evasions. At the same time she is in trembling
dialog: and fear for Raoul. What is being done to him?
text: Erick is frenzied and insistent. Christine is hard
text: pressed. He follows her into a corner and is telling

dialog: and is mechanically searching for the secret
dialog: spring. If the forest from the reflected iron
dialog: trap is seen here, it is just as it was when first

dialog: discovered exploring the box with torches. Others
text: are in the ante-room. One man lifts a rug - another
text: begins to tap the big pillar with a small iron bar.
text: He suddenly cries out that it is hollow. He taps it
text: and all listen to the hollow sound. One man with a
text: fireman's ax ruthlessly pries at a square ornament
text: on the pillar. The ornament gives way - revealing
text: a passageway down thru the pillar. They peer down.

dialog: 
text: Erick is still in the midst of his terrible scene with
dialog: Christine. He is thundering at her. "Tell me that you
dialog: love me!" Christine is groggy - she has the intention
dialog: of telling Erick, "Take me!" but her emotions have
text: exhausted her. She is almost out of her mind. Her
text: eyes are wild and she sways groggily, staggers to the
text: couch and sinks down upon it. Erick bends over her
text: in an ecstasy. He bends within a short distance of
dialog: her white face and tells her: "You are as beautiful
dialog: as if you were dead!" Erick continues along the
dialog: same line.

speaker_heading: INT TORTURE GARDEN AMBER
dialog: 
text: Raoul is lying upon the floor, panting, exhausted,
text: crazed. The Persian, who himself is beginning to
dialog: grow wild, is feeling aimlessly about the floor for
text: the hidden spring. His finger touches something
text: that gives, a nail head, which slightly protrudes
text: above the floor...which responds to his touch.
text: In his semi-delirium, he cries out in exultation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
dialog: 
text: A shot including screened opening. Erick is bending
text: over Christine declaiming, bemoaning her beauty.
text: This scene is instantly broken when Erick hears the
text: Persian's cry of exultation. He is thrown out of his
text: wild ecstatic mood and moves swiftly up the steps,
text: draws back the drape and looks through the screened
dialog: opening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER AMBER
dialog: 
text: The Persian is crying out in mad exultation that he
dialog: has found it. - But Raoul is too far gone to hear him.
text: The Persian takes the nail head between his fingers
text: and pulls it up about an inch. There is an instant
text: of suspense in which nothing transpires. Then a
dialog: section of the floor about three by five, falls about
text: two inches. -then slides away horizontally, and
text: reveals a wooden stair leading downward. The Persian
text: inhales the cool air from below, then drags Raoul to
text: the opening. Raoul drinks of the cool air as if water.
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM ERICK LOOKING THRU OPENING
text: He is not the least perturbed. He is amused.
speaker_heading: INT CELLAR #2 AMBER
dialog: 
text: This is the dummy set. The mob, led by Simon, are
text: waving torches and exploring, pulling down dummies
dialog: and exploring dark recesses. This is sort of a pro-
dialog: perty room and members of the mob pick up spears,
dialog: bludgeons, and executioner's axes, which they brand-
text: ish. Mob psychology is beginning to manifest itself.
text: The men stab the dummies with their spears, while
dialog: Florine is active in giving directions. He is afraid
text: and like a child keeps near and clings to Simon. In
dialog: the scenes to follow he always manages to keep be-
text: tween two strong men with bludgeons and spears.
dialog: (These cellar scenes may be cut in at will, may be
dialog: used as flashes or in whole.)
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT CELLAR #3 AMBER
dialog: 
text: This is the dragon set. The mob sweeps in led by
dialog: Simon, and again all stage properties in the nature
dialog: of weapons are appropriated. It will be especially
dialog: good if there are lots of spears. In passing the
dialog: dragon Florine clings very closely to Simon. There
dialog: is a reason for not having Florine point out here
text: what he sees in the dragon's mouth.
speaker_heading: INT CELLAR #4 AMBER
dialog: 
text: This is the headless statue set. The mob, led by
dialog: Simon sweeps in, appropriates any properties that
dialog: are valuable and pass out down the stairs leading to
dialog: the Roi de Lahore set. Florine is especially fearful
dialog: of going down these stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT CELLAR BRIDGE SET AMBER
dialog: Another portion of the mob, in which Simon and Florine
text: are absent, passes over the bridge, while others
text: with torches, run over the bridge.
speaker_heading: INT TORTURE CHAMBER AMBER
dialog: The cool air has revived Raoul and his senses have
text: returned to him. The Persian holds his dark lantern
text: in his hand and is urging Raoul to follow him down-

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT BOTTOM CELLAR FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
text: The source of light is from the torture chamber.
dialog: The location of cellar is directly under Erick's
text: living room. A set of wooden steps lead up to
text: a trap opening in the floor of the living room.
dialog: This is a very low cellar and enough barrels of
dialog: all sizes are stacked about to give the appearance
dialog: of a big wine cellar. The ceiling of this cellar
dialog: is necessary for the action. The Persian, carrying
text: his dark lantern, and Raoul enter down the stairway
text: leading from the torture chamber. They are looking
text: back apprehensively because a grating of heavy
text: bars descends behind them, cutting off their retreat
dialog: to the torture chamber, and by no action of their
dialog: own. While they are most dying of thirst, they
text: still are mystified at the great number of barrels.
text: They run to the barrels and each kneels at the one
text: he has chosen. They kneel and begin to pull at
text: the bungs, long enough to take hold of and pull out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
dialog: 
text: Erick is in the act of sweeping down the steps from
text: the screened opening. In a sardonic, demoniacal manner
dialog: he begins to sing:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "BARRELS! BARRELS! ANY BARRELS TO SELL?"
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK: This singing revives Christine - she gathers her
text: scattered senses, and shrinks from Erick as if he
text: were crazy. He strides up and down the room singing
dialog: his strange song.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT BOTTOM CELLAR FAINT GREEN
speaker_heading: MED C.V. RAOUL & PERSIAN
dialog: 
dialog: This strange song coming directly from above their

text: look upward with new dread then back to the bungs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: C.V. RAOUL KNEELING BEFORE BARREL FAINT GREEN
text: Raoul pulls the bung, cups his hands to catch the
dialog: precious water, but instead of a fluid running into
text: his hands, it is filled with something that looks
text: like black sand. Raoul looks at it stupidly as it
text: runs through his fingers.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
text: The Persian pulls the bung stopper of his barrel
text: and the same black powder flows into his hand. He
text: looks at the material in horror, empties it out of
text: his hand and removes the lantern to a safe distance.
dialog: He then tells Raoul with dread:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "IT IS GUNPOWDER!"
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK: Raoul is bewildered but the Persian flies into
dialog: action.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
dialog: The Persian runs around the cellar experimenting
text: and examining it with his dark lantern. He is
text: followed by Raoul. They pause at the steps which
text: lead to Erick's voice above. They then go up the
dialog: steps as far as they can go and listen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
dialog: 
text: Erick is striding down the room toward the camera
dialog: singing in his demoniacal manner, "Barrels, Barrels
dialog: Any Barrels to sell?" Christine has risen from the
text: couch and is crouching against the wall. She believes
text: Erick has turned maniac. Erick stops singing, turns
text: and takes a step toward her. There is a lightning
text: transition in his manner. Pointing at her, he hurls
dialog: the final threat:
dialog: 
dialog: "SHALL YOU BE ERICK'S BRIDE OR NOT?"
text: BACK: He strides over to her without waiting for her.
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE AMBER
text: Erick is becoming rapidly carried away by his own
dialog: weird madness. Still without waiting for a reply
dialog: from Christine he pantomimes something being blown
dialog: up and continues:
dialog: 
dialog: "IF NOT, EVERYBODY WILL BE DEAD AND BURIED
text: BENEATH THE RUINS OF THE PARIS GRAND

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT BOTTOM CELLAR FAINT GREEN CLOSE UP RAOUL & PERSIAN
text: Their lantern is upon the highest step. The two

dialog: understand that Erick will ignite the tons of
dialog: gunpowder.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S
dialog: 
text: Erick continues in his mad wild ecstasy. Without
text: waiting for Christine's reply - he grabs her by the
text: wrist and drags her across the room to a Spanish
dialog: chest on the left.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE AMBER
text: From his chamois bag he takes a key and unlocks
text: the chest. He opens the chest revealing the
dialog: following contrivance:
dialog: 
text: Upon a piece of plate glass are two objects - a grass
text: hopper and a scorpion, both made of Japanese bronze.
dialog: From each of these objects a rod runs downward out
text: of sight. Coming up thru the glass is a liquid, watery
text: light effect. Coming up thru the glass is light.
text: Christine feels an unaccountable dread at the sight
dialog: of the little bronze objects. Erick tells her:
dialog: "IF YOU TURN THE SCORPION AROUND
dialog: IT WILL MEAN THAT YOU HAVE SAID 'YES'
dialog: THE GRASSHOPPER WILL MEAN 'NO'!"
speaker_heading: LONGER SHOT AMBER
text: Erick turns and walks wildly and rapidly toward
dialog: the music room. Upon the steps leading to this
text: room, he turns upon Christine and in a demoniacal
dialog: manner tells her:
text: "BE CAREFUL OF THE GRASSHOPPER.
dialog: IT HOPS...AND IT HOPS JOLLY HIGH"
dialog: 
text: BACK: With this he swings into the music room, sits
text: down at the organ and begins to play wildly,
text: a skeleton gone mad. Christine stands in terror,
text: fascinated by the scorpion and the grasshopper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT CELLAR #5 AMBER
dialog: 
dialog: This is Roi de Lahore set. The mob is sweeping
dialog: down the circular staircase. Florine very much
dialog: frightened - is talking, telling where the body
dialog: of Buquet was hanging and where he saw the move-
dialog: ment in the dark opening - some of the mob runs
text: out toward the spot of the hanging while others
text: begin to break down the door in the dark opening.
text: Simon herds the men out toward the camera. These
dialog: cellar scenes are wild and rapid and are not held
dialog: up by individuals, closeups, business, so that the effect
dialog: will be the that of the menace sweeping downward like a
dialog: great wave.
scene_heading: CLOSE VIEW CHRISTINE BENDING OVER CABINET

dialog: 
dialog: "DON'T TOUCH THE SCORPION!"
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER C.V. CHRISTINE
dialog: 
text: As she jerks her hand away from the scorpion as if it
dialog: had stung her. Christine's indecision and agony
text: leave her. It is as if her mind suddenly cleared.
text: She becomes very calm. It is here that she makes her
dialog: her decision that she will become Erick's wife. She is in
dialog: the spirit of a nun taking her final orders that will
dialog: forever remove her from society. With quiet delib-
text: ration she turns toward Erick.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LONGER SHOT AMBER
dialog: 
text: Erick is playing wildly upon the organ. But this
text: is held only for a few feet. Erick senses the change
text: of atmosphere, stops playing, turns toward Christine
text: and rises. This places him at the top of the two steps
text: between the two rooms. Christine walks toward him,
text: quietly and with deliberation and pauses at the bot-
dialog: tom of the steps.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED CLOSE UP ERICK AND CHRISTINE AMBER
dialog: 
text: Christine gazes up at him earnestly and the picture
text: is held for an instant. Erick realizes that the
dialog: final moment is at hand and there is a sense of
text: terror in his manner. She asks him in a trembling
dialog: voice:
dialog: "DO YOU SWEAR TO ME THAT THE
dialog: SCORPION IS THE ONE TO TURN?"
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK: For the first time Erick shows fear. In a
dialog: hushed way he answers her:
dialog: 
dialog: "YES...IF YOU WISH TO BE MY BRIDE"
text: BACK: Quietly she turns from him.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AMBER
dialog: Without an instant's hesitation, but with
dialog: thorough consciousness of what she is doing
dialog: she turns the scorpion.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
text: A tremendous volume of water is rushing into the
dialog: cellar. To make this effective it must be arranged
dialog: so that this cellar can be completely filled in
text: twenty feet of film. As the water reaches the barrels
dialog: they float and spin around, but they float like filled

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT ON LAKE #2 FAINT GREEN
dialog: 
dialog: This is the lake shot outside of the door to

scene_heading: INT CELLAR CROSS SECTIONAL SHOT AMBER
dialog: 
text: The three levels are filled with the mob.
text: Torches are aflame. Hundreds of spears are in the

dialog: Many jump from one level to another. Others slide
dialog: down pipes. The general effect is of a multitude
dialog: pouring downward.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Erick is discovered as he was left, cringing before
text: Christine, afraid. She lays a hand upon his shoulder
dialog: and reminds him of those whose cries for help
text: both can hear. Like a dog, Erick obeys her. He throws
text: back a rug, revealing a trap door. This he throws
dialog: open. Raoul and the Persian are discovered, half
dialog: drowned in the water which has risen to within a few
text: inches of the floor. The two men are so far gone that
dialog: they are in do condition to engage Erick in battle.
text: Erick, aided by Christine, drags both of the men out
text: of the water. The trap is left open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP OF GROUP AMBER
dialog: 
text: Raoul is still alive and conscious. He is saved.
text: Christine is calm and very sad. Erick steps back
dialog: and tells the two men:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "I HAVE SAVED YOU TO PLEASE MY WIFE."
dialog: 
text: BACK: Raoul's eyes, dread and questioning, are upon
text: Christine. Very quietly and sadly, she indicates
dialog: "Yes, it is true." Slowly the arm of the sounding
text: device rises, unseen by those in the picture and
text: falls with a clang. All are checked at this un-
text: suspected interruption. The arm continues falling.
speaker_heading: INT ON LAKE #1 AMBER
text: The water has receded almost two feet. The action
dialog: in these scenes is swift. Simon and Florine are
dialog: standing on the spot where Philippe was strangled.
text: Simon is beckoning the mob toward him. The first of
text: the mob is running down a runway thru a distant
dialog: arch. Spears and weapons are flourishing, torches
text: flaring. As the first of the mob reaches the boat
text: landing, the rest of the mob continues to bank up
dialog: the background.
speaker_heading: A CLOSE SHOT OF FLORINE AMBER
text: The mob is behind him and no one is paying the least
text: attention to him. Simon is doing all of the talking.
dialog: Florine indicates "Follow me" Florine plants the
dialog: idea that he is going to jump into the water about
text: three feet deep. Florine jumps and lights stiff
dialog: legged in the water about six inches deep. (The
dialog: audience will think that he is going right out of
dialog: sight) Florine shows quick surprise "This is easy."
dialog: He beckons to the others, "Come in" - takes a step and
text: disappears, shoots straight out of sight. Without any
dialog: attempt to save himself. Still no one pays any
dialog: attention to his disappearance.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE LONG SHOT AMBER
dialog: 
text: The first of the mob wades into the water. They
text: continue wading, shouting, waving their torches and
dialog: spears, until the entire set, water and back of boat
text: landing is filled. The mob is still pouring in from
text: the distant background. Florine comes up to the sur-
text: face blundering and spitting water. He swims out of
dialog: the little hole he has fallen into and follows the
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: INT LAKE #2 AMBER
dialog: 
text: The mob is approaching. Hundreds of torches appear.
text: The mob does not move directly to Erick's door, but
text: does some exploring. Erick swiftly enters from the
text: door in the f.g., runs along the shelf, looks at the
text: mob and swiftly moves back into the drawing room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE UP FLORINE AMBER
dialog: 
dialog: He is somewhat apart from the others who are wading
text: waist deep. Florine is swimming dog fashioned. A
text: peculiar expression comes over his face as he stops
text: swimming and feels under the water. Then he stands up.
text: The water is only to his knees.
speaker_heading: A LONGER SHOT AMBER
text: A number or the mob catches sight of the door to
dialog: Erick's living room. News of the discovery travels
dialog: quickly and this is a general wild movement in
dialog: that direction.
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER
dialog: 
dialog: Raoul and the Persian are still upon the floor,
dialog: but are rapidly regaining their strength. Christine
text: is in misery, half in tears, explaining to him that
text: someday he will understand. Erick swiftly enters
dialog: from Christine's bedroom carrying a cloak. Erick
text: throws the cloak over her shoulders. He indicates
dialog: for Christine to come. She does not wish to but
dialog: she is willing to live up to her promise. She allows
text: Erick to sweep her out of the room into his bedroom.
dialog: This is all very flat. Raoul is very weak but he will
text: fight for Christine. Raoul staggers to his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ON LAKE #2 AMBER
dialog: 
text: The space around the door and the lake are filled
text: with the mob. They begin to pound upon the door
dialog: with their weapons.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM
dialog: 
text: The Persian staggers to his feet and goes toward
text: the door of the lake. Raoul drags himself towards
text: Erick's bedroom. Both men are very worn and weak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S BED CHAMBER AMBER
dialog: 
text: The action here is swift. Erick jerks down one
text: of the black velvet drapes in the f.g. revealing
text: a door and a staircase leading upwards. The drape
dialog: that Erick jerks partly falls obliquely across
text: the coffin. The coffin is hidden from the entrance
dialog: view but not from the camera view. The moment the
text: door is opened, a draft comes down the stairs
dialog: corridor and causes all of the draperies in the
text: room to shimmer. Erick softly leads Christine up
dialog: these stairs closing the door after him. Raoul
text: drags himself in and reels towards the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM AMBER
dialog: 
text: The Persian unlocks the door leading to the
dialog: lake. The mob led by Simon, floods in and fills
text: the room. The mob is wet. Florine is still in
dialog: evidence. The Persian indicates Erick's bed
text: chamber. He and Simon and others run toward the
dialog: chamber.
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S BEDCHAMBER AMBER
dialog: 
text: Raoul has opened the door leading to the stair
text: corridor, and all of the draperies are shimmering.
text: He is looking up the stairs. Simon, the Persian
text: and the others rush in. Simon excited sees the
text: coffin in only passing image. It is apparent
dialog: the direction Erick has fled. Simon gives the
dialog: Persian an order, Simon and about twenty others run up
text: the stairs, sweeping Raoul along with them.
text: The others all exit swiftly to the drawing room,
text: led by the Persian. When the last man has left the
text: room Florine enters. The coffin is not visible to
dialog: him, while it is to the audience. Florine is
dialog: a forlorn figure. He calls:
dialog: 
dialog: "SIMON! SIMON!"
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BACK: The audience first sees what is happening.
text: There is a gust of wind from the corridor stairs.
text: It blows the drape which is lying obliquely over
text: the coffin in such a manner that it looks like a man's
text: head moving behind it. Florine now sees this.
text: But he is tired of being afraid. He picks up a club
text: which one of the mob left. He sneaks up to the
text: imaginary head, takes aim and gives it a terrible
text: whollop. The blow reveals the coffin and knocks
text: it over. It reels over twice and comes to rest face
text: up. Florine drops the club and tears out of the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT ERICK'S DRAWING ROOM AMBER
text: The room is empty. Florine tears in, running,
text: looking back at the coffin room. He pauses on the
text: very edge of the open trap. He stands, his back to
text: the trap, looking toward the coffin room as if he
dialog: anticipated someone to come out and attack him.
text: Then he backs, steps over the missing trap, paying
text: no attention to it. He backs until his heels hits
text: the first step of the entrance door. Then he turns
dialog: and flies for his life.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT ROI DE LAHORE SET...AMBER
dialog: 
dialog: This is played very swift and is made as short as
dialog: possible. Christine and Erick enter through the dark
text: opening, the door to which has now been battered down,
text: like two swiftly moving shadows. Erick sweeps her
text: along. They pass across the set and exit to the right.
text: The set is lighted by torches of the approaching
dialog: mob. The moment that Erick and Christine are out,
text: the mob enters from the left, Simon and Raoul in

dialog:
