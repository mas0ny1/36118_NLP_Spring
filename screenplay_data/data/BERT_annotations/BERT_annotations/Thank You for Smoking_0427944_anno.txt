dialog: A couple years ago, RJR Nabisco, the

speaker_heading: OPRAH

speaker_heading: NICK (V.0.)
dialog: This is the man they rely on, Erhardt Von

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I’m sorry, but I don’t think that’s

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I have to agree. I don’t see the humor in

text: Whip to Robin for reaction... but Cancer Kid is laughing.
text: Nick is beside himself. He smiles as if he just became a

text: Nick looks back to Mr. Ron Goode with renewed confidence.
text: Nick attacks.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (to Ron)
dialog: Oh, why don’t you leave him alone and
dialog: stop trying to tell him how he ought to
dialog: feel.
dialog: (to Oprah)
dialog: This is typical of the attitude of the
dialog: federal government. It’s this same
dialog: attitude that brought us Prohibition
dialog: Vietnam, and fifty years of living on the
text: brink of nuclear destruction.
dialog: (pointing to Ron)
dialog: But for a member of the government to
dialog: come on this show and lecture about
dialog: cancer, when the same government for the
dialog: last sixty years has been producing
dialog: atomic bombs, twenty-five thousand of
dialog: them, capable of giving every man, woman,
dialog: and child on this planet cancer so awful,
text: so ghastly, so untreatable, that medical

dialog: yet, is just beneath contempt.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Beneath contempt? This from the man whose

speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: RON(CONT'D)
dialog: This from the man who will profit off

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oprah, how on earth would “Big Tobacco”
dialog: profit off of the loss of this young man?
dialog: I hate to think in such callous terms,
dialog: but if anything we’d be losing a
dialog: customer. It’s not only our hope but it’s
dialog: in our best interests to keep Robin alive
dialog: and smoking.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: That’s ludicrous!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Let me tell you something Oprah, and let

text: concerned people in the audience today.
dialog: The Ron Goode’s of this world want the
text: Robin Willigers to die.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (Holds Robin’s shoulder)
dialog: Awful, but true. I’m sorry, but it’s a
dialog: fact. And do you know why? I’1l1 tell you
dialog: why. So that their budgets will go up.
dialog: This is nothing less than trafficking in
dialog: human misery, and you, sir, ought to be
dialog: ashamed of yourself.
dialog: (back to audience)
dialog: Of course the Academy does not condone
dialog: underage smoking, or drinking and driving
dialog: for that matter, for the simple reason
dialog: that they are against the law.
dialog: (time for the ammo)
dialog: As a matter of fact, we’re about to
dialog: launch... a fifty-million-dollar campaign
dialog: aimed at persuading kids not to smoke.
speaker_heading: OPRAH

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Eight 0’Clock is when the little hand is

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jill, I can’t help feeling that Joey is

dialog: give him a fair and balanced perspective.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Nick, you had plenty of time to be his

speaker_heading: BRAD

dialog: Perhaps then cigarettes will finally be

dialog: be holding a congressional hearing to
dialog: discuss the inclusion of the skull and

speaker_heading: BR
dialog: Not specifically.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (imitating Bacall)
text: She sort of shimmies in through the

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: ...And she catches them. Greatest romance

dialog: These days when someone smokes in a

dialog: (even worse)
dialog: European.
text: Nick goes in for the kill.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The message Hollywood needs to send out

dialog: his box of chocolates. Hugh Grant earning
dialog: back the love of Julia Roberts by buying

speaker_heading: BR
dialog: Well, it’s a thought. I was hoping for

speaker_heading: NICK (V.0.)
dialog: The Club was founded by the Tobacco

text: The Captain takes a long sip.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Do you enjoy your current work, Nick?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes, it’s challenging. If you can do
dialog: Tobacco, you can do anything.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: You kind of struggled before this.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes, briefly.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: It’s one of the reasons we hired you.
text: Nick looks up in disbelief (”really?”).
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Nothing pushes a man harder than the need

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: You know Nick, you remind me just a

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thank you sir.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Tell me, what is your opinion of BR?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: BR is... my boss.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: I like to think that I’m your boss, son.
dialog: But I do admire loyalty in a man. I can
dialog: forgive almost anything in a man if he’s
dialog: loyal. Like that Oprah show you did. You
dialog: could have given up, cried and
dialog: apologized, but you stayed loyal. And you
dialog: gave it to that son’v’a bitch good.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thank you sir.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: BR’s come under the idea that we should
dialog: start bribing Producers in Hollywood to

text: It takes every part of Nick’s strength to not verbally

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Is a mortgage really much of a life goal?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ninety-nine percent of everything that is
dialog: done in the world, good or bad is done to

dialog: be a better place if everyone rented.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Why don’t you rent?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, I rent as well.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Really?

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: JOEY

text: Jill raises an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I just don’t want to become a pawn in

speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: JEFF

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Do I have flexible morals?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, lets say you became a lawyer, right?
dialog: And, you were asked to defend a murderer.
text: Worse than that, a child murderer. The law

dialog: I mean, when I was growing up. We all
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: Last year, after I got diagnosed, I flew
dialog: east to attend the annual stockholders’

dialog: And do you know what your boss said to
dialog: me?
text: Nick knows, but doesn’t interrupt.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: He said ‘We’re certainly sorry to hear
dialog: about your medical problem.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH(CONT'D)
dialog: However, without knowing your medical
dialog: history, we can’t comment further.’ Then
dialog: they tried to pretend I never worked for
dialog: them. I mean I’ve got pay stubs, but hell
dialog: I’m on the damn billboards.
dialog: (breaks for breath)
dialog: I never even smoked Marlboro. I smoked
dialog: Kools.

speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: PEARL

text: Hold on Nick as he chooses his words carefully.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I’m good at it. I’m better at doing this
dialog: than I ever was at doing anything else.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: Well hell, son, I was good at shooting
dialog: Koreans, but I didn’t make it my career.
text: There is a pause as Lorne studies Nick.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: I suppose we all got to pay the mortgage
dialog: somehow.
text: Nick exhales.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: So, you here to talk me into shutting up?
dialog: Is that what’s in that case of yours?
text: Joey stares, trying to keep up with the action.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, basically...
dialog: (picking up the briefcase)
dialog: No, not basically. That’s exactly it.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: My dignity ain’t for sale.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: This isn’t an offer. It’s a gift. The
dialog: taxes have all been paid. You get to keep
dialog: it no matter what you do. The idea is
dialog: that your guilt will prevent you from bad-
dialog: mouthing us.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: Were you supposed to tell me all that?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No. Just apologize, give you the money,
dialog: and leave.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: Then why are you telling me this?
text: A moment. Joey gets closer. Then...
text: Nick ignites. He looks up at Lorne.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Because this way, you’1ll take the money.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: Why would I do that?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Because you’re mad. The first thing
dialog: you’1l do is call the LA Times and CNN.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: Damn straight.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And insist on Bonnie Dalton. She does
dialog: really good controlled outrage. Tell them
dialog: no Bonnie, no story, watch it on MSNBC.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: (trying to keep up)
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: When they get here, open up the case and

speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: Why?
text: Nick is really cooking now. He gets up...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’1l look more effective. Here, look...
text: Nick opens the briefcase and begins to dump the MONEY onto
dialog: the floor... it’s a lot of money.
text: Joey’s eyes widen.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (shaking the case)
dialog: Don’t forget to shake every last bundle

text: Nick dumps the briefcase.
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH

speaker_heading: NICK

dialog: (back to pitch)
dialog: The TV coverage will be great...
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: Wait, what about my family?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Whoa, Lorne, you can’t keep the money.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: (caught in the enthusiasm)
dialog: Why the hell not?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What, denounce us and then keep the blood
dialog: money? Look at it.
text: Lorne looks at the pile of money. One million dollars is a
dialog: lot of money.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: I’ve got to think it over.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You can’t denounce us next week. News
dialog: doesn’t work that way Lorne.
speaker_heading: LORNE LUTCH
dialog: I don’t suppose I can denounce you for

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No Lorne. You either keep all the money

text: Nick shoots a look at Joey, ready to question how he saw
text: Lorne and the briefcase, but relents - He saw.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You’d have to be crazy to turn down all
dialog: that money. As soon as I saw he wasn’t
dialog: crazy, I knew he’d take it.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Would you have taken it?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: If I were him?
dialog: (thinks for a second)

speaker_heading: JOEY

dialog: with pride.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Now Nick, you created quite a fuss on the
dialog: Oprah Show, didn’t you?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I’ll say this. I don’t think I will be
dialog: getting my annual invitation to the
dialog: Finistirre Labor Day Barbecue.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: Uh, Larry, as you probably know, I don’t
dialog: believe in the annual barbecuing of
dialog: livestock which only adds to the animal
dialog: cruelty problem that permeates the
dialog: heartland.
speaker_heading: LARRY KING
dialog: Well, Senator, it doesn’t sound like
dialog: you’1ll be having Nick over anytime soon
dialog: for anything.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: I continue to offer an open invitation to
dialog: Mr. Naylor to join us in Congress to
dialog: discuss the inclusion of our new poison
dialog: label, which if I may say...
speaker_heading: LARRY KING
dialog: How ‘bout it Nick? Will you be making an
dialog: appearance in Congress.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Not as long as the Senator is calling for
dialog: me to be fired. It’s not exactly a
dialog: welcome invitation.
speaker_heading: LARRY KING
dialog: It could be considered a mixed message,
dialog: Senator.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: Not as mixed as Big Tobacco’s stance on
dialog: the dangers of smoking cigarettes.
text: Nick begins to laugh. This takes both Larry & Finistirre off
dialog: guard.
speaker_heading: LARRY KING
dialog: Nick, now you’re laughing? The Senator
dialog: does have a point, doesn’t he?
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: I can’t help myself. I’m tickled by the
dialog: idea of the gentleman from Vermont
dialog: calling me a hypocrite. This from a man,
dialog: who in one day, held a press conference
dialog: where he called for the American tobacco
text: fields to be slashed and burned. Then,
text: jumped on a private jet. Flew down to
dialog: Peru for the Eco Summit and denounced the
dialog: Meed corporation for deforestation. I’m
dialog: sorry, I find that funny.
dialog: Joey’s smile says: My dad is one bad ass motherfucker
speaker_heading: LARRY KING
dialog: Would you like to respond, Mr. Senator?
text: Finistirre thinks about this. He’s really holding back.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: (straining)
dialog: Um. No.
speaker_heading: LARRY KING
dialog: Emotional issue.
dialog: (switches gears)
dialog: Lets take some calls. Herndon, Virginia,
dialog: you’re on the air.
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: Larry, has anyone ever announced that
dialog: they’re going to kill someone live on
dialog: your show?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: No, but we get a lot of angry calls.
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: Then it’s your lucky day, because I’m
dialog: here to tell you that within a week,
dialog: we’re going to dispatch Mr. Naylor from
dialog: this planet, for all the pain and
dialog: suffering he’s caused the world.
text: The phone clicks. An awkward pause. Nick is stunned.

scene_heading: INT. BOEING 767 - DAY
text: Nick walks back from the bathroom to his seat. On his way, he
text: observes each passenger, trying to discern the amount of fear
text: in their eyes.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.0.)
dialog: Most people don’t want to die. Cigarette
dialog: smokers included. It’s funny how many
dialog: times a day people say things like, “I
dialog: ought-a KILL him” or “Don’t make me KILL
dialog: you.” Only with me, they are usually
dialog: being serious.
text: Nick takes his seat next to Joey in the BULKHEAD. Joey has

text: A FLIGHT ATTENDANT stops at their row.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: (to Joey)
dialog: I’m sorry, young man, but you can’t keep
dialog: your feet on there.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: If you don’t want people putting their

dialog: carpet?
text: The flight attendant has to hand it to him. Good point. She
text: winks and doesn’t say another word. Nick smiles at his son.
scene_heading: INT. DULLES AIRPORT - DAY
text: Nick pushes a LUGGAGE CART. Joey walks next to him, one hand

scene_heading: EXT. JILL NAYLOR’S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

scene_heading: EXT. NICK’S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING
text: Nick rounds the corner and is about to pull into his garage,

scene_heading: INT. UNKNOWN APARTMENT - EVENING

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Nick and Heather fuck. Meanwhile, on the TV behind them a

text: Heather sees Nick on TV and suddenly stops.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Oh my god, you’re on TV!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You were watching TV?

speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Okay, Joey, you’re up.
text: Joey stays seated for a moment and takes in a deep breath
dialog: like his father usually does.
text: He gets up and swaggers to the front of the room, taking each
text: step with confidence, swallowing the entire room. Joey then
text: spins and faces the class.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What makes America the best government? A
dialog: passion that doesn’t exist anywhere else
dialog: in the world? Sure, you can call it
text: capitalism. A free market. A celebration

speaker_heading: SON
dialog: Dad, when do I get to smoke?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: When you’re eighteen, son. If you tried

dialog: Then you could never play in the major

text: Father laughs and pats his son’s head.
speaker_heading: SON
dialog: When I get older, I’m going to smoke your

text: An AD MAN steps forward and turns off the Monitor.
speaker_heading: AD MAN
dialog: It’s brilliance, if I may say so, is in

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: How’s that?
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: AD MAN
dialog: Say the last three words of the tag out
dialog: loud.
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: BR

speaker_heading: AD MAN

dialog: dike you.’
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The Captain will be pleased.
dialog: (switching gears)
dialog: What about these skull and crossbones
dialog: they want us to put on the packs?
text: The AD MAN pulls out a DISPLAY CARD, hidden by a sheer cloth.
speaker_heading: AD MAN
dialog: Okay, now this was a challenge. However
dialog: nothing in the verbiage of the bill
dialog: specified that we couldn’t make it our
text: own skull and crossbones.
text: Nick and BR nod. Impressed by the logic.
speaker_heading: AD MAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Gentlemen, let me introduce you to...
dialog: (whips back the cloth)
dialog: . HAVE A NICE DEATH!
text: The DISPLAY shows a SKULL AND CROSSBONES contorted into the
dialog: happy face associated with “have a nice day” - It’s horrifying.
speaker_heading: BR
dialog: Is that what I think it is?
speaker_heading: AD MAN
dialog: It scored just slightly higher than our
dialog: second place design... “Mr. Death’s
dialog: neighborhood.”
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It’s awful.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: BR
dialog: Nick, we can’t let that bill pass...

speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: INT. JOEY’S CLASSROOM - EARLIER

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No, for being his father.

speaker_heading: POLLY(CONT'D)
dialog: Did you see the coverage the fetal-
dialog: alcohol people got themselves over this
dialog: weekend. They made it sound like we
dialog: encourage pregnant mothers to drink. I’m
dialog: surprised I didn’t get kidnapped on the

text: This catches Nick’s attention.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (patronizing)
dialog: I don’t think people who work for the

text: All movement stops. Polly stares Nick down.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Pardon me?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look, nothing personal, but tobacco

speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Oh, this is news.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: My product puts away 475 thousand a

speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (rhetorical)
dialog: Oh, now 475 is a legit number?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Okay, 435 thousand, that’s twelve hundred
dialog: a day. How many alcohol related deaths a
dialog: year? A hundred thousand, tops? Two
dialog: hundred seventy something a day? Well wow-
dialog: wee. Two hundred and seventy people. Oh,

speaker_heading: BOBBY JAY
dialog: Okay, let’s breathe.
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: BOBBY JAY
dialog: Eleven thousand.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Eleven thousand? You’ve got to be kidding

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Wo, wo, wo!... Can we get a dialogue
dialog: going here?
dialog: No answer.
text: Then, a voice breaks the silence. A friendly voice, actually.
text: Saturday morning cartoon friendly. It could be Mr. Rogers.
speaker_heading: KIDNAPPER
dialog: Hi Nick.
text: The kidnapper sits behind Nick’s head. His face is hidden in

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Can we talk about this? Usually, they let

dialog: That’s kind of the whole point.
speaker_heading: KIDNAPPER
dialog: Nick, we want you to stop killing people.
dialog: So many people. Half a million people a

dialog: SLAP!... SLAP!, SLAP!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look, I think it’s perfectly legitimate

speaker_heading: KIDNAPPER
dialog: Nick, just listen, all right? Says here

speaker_heading: DOCTOR

speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: I must be, because I thought you were
dialog: apologizing.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I’m getting to that. Look, you two are
dialog: basically my only friends. The last thing
dialog: I ever wanted to do was hurt either of
dialog: you. I can only imagine how the two of
dialog: you must have felt...
text: Bobby Jay cracks a smile. Nick stops in question of the look.
speaker_heading: NICK

dialog: (immediately to Polly)
dialog: Why is he smiling?
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: He won a hundred bucks on you.

speaker_heading: BOBBY JAY
dialog: I bet Polly that you’d spill the

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: NICK (ON TV)
dialog: To all the people who were mentioned
dialog: in the recent newspaper article, please
dialog: take comfort in knowing that I will not
dialog: rest until your names are cleared. This
dialog: experience has taught me an important
dialog: lesson: Having sexual affairs with
dialog: members of the press is just unfair. Not
dialog: unfair to me mind you, but to all the
dialog: people in my life whose only crime is
dialog: knowing me.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: NICK(CONT'D)
dialog: It was your names, not mine, that
dialog: suffered from my entertaining of a
text: meaningless affair with a seductress in
text: the form of a young blond Washington Post
dialog: reporter, whose name I won’t mention
dialog: because I... have dignity.
text: Finistirre simply grunts at this.
speaker_heading: NICK (ON TV)
dialog: There have been wide accusations of me
dialog: dropping out from tomorrow’s senate sub-
dialog: committee. Let it be known, that unless
dialog: Senator Finistirre has withdrawn my
dialog: invitation to speak...
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: (to TV)
dialog: It’s called a subpoena.
speaker_heading: NICK (ON TV)
dialog: it is my plan to be present in

dialog: its products. Thank you for your time.
dialog: See you tomorrow.

text: As we get closer, a phone rings in the background. Then a

text: The Senator looks to his desk, where his phone’s many lines
text: are all blinking.
text: He goes to his desk, and pulls out a sheet that reads:
scene_heading: SCHEDULE OF EVENTS

scene_heading: INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - DAY
text: The hearing is just beginning. Senator Finistirre and nine of
text: his colleagues sit at a long table before the audience. Each
text: one has a pitcher of water and a microphone. Finistirre scans

speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: Okay, lets bring this meeting to order.
dialog: We’ll try our best to keep everything
dialog: brief and concise, so we can all make it

speaker_heading: MEDICAL ADVISOR
dialog: The skull and crossbones means one thing:

dialog: Like any other product that carries the
dialog: branding, if you take it, you will die.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: Is this not overkill? I mean, why not
dialog: just use words as we currently do?
dialog: Something that describes the dangers of
dialog: cigarettes?
speaker_heading: MEDICAL ADVISOR
dialog: The American public is not affected by
dialog: mast head anymore. They need photographs.
dialog: We’ve done studies which show that
dialog: consumers react up to eighty percent more
text: to imagery rather than words. The stats
dialog: are there. It’s just sad that the Academy
dialog: of Tobacco Studies did not release this
dialog: type of information earlier...
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: And when you say the Academy of Tobacco
dialog: Studies, you are referring to the
dialog: coalition represented by...
text: FREEZE FRAME on the Senator.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.0.)
dialog: Let it be known, the public beating has
dialog: not gone out of style.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
speaker_heading: LATINO MAN
dialog: The current use of words instead of

speaker_heading: LATINO MAN(CONT'D)
text: The skull and crossbones speaks loudly in

speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE

text: back is... Joey. The twelve year old sneaks an excited wave.
text: Nick suddenly becomes uncomfortable. He waves back, but we
text: can tell he is bothered.
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Please state your name, address, and
dialog: current occupation.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: My name is Nick Naylor. I live at the
dialog: Watergate. I am currently unemployed, but
dialog: until recently, I was the Vice President
dialog: of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: Mr. Naylor, as Vice President of the
dialog: Academy of Tobacco Studies, what was
dialog: required of you? What did you do?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I informed the public of all the research
dialog: performed in the investigation on the
dialog: effects of tobacco.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: And what, so far, has the Academy
dialog: concluded in the investigation on the
dialog: effects of tobacco?
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, many things actually. Why just the
dialog: other day, they uncovered evidence that
dialog: smoking can offset Parkinson's disease.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: I’m sure the health community is
dialog: thrilled. Mr. Naylor, Who provides the
dialog: financial backing for the Academy of
dialog: Tobacco Studies?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Conglomerated Tobacco.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: (clarifying)
dialog: That is the cigarette companies?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: For the most part, yes.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: Do you think this affects their
dialog: priorities?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No. Just as I’m sure campaign
dialog: contributions don’t affect yours.
text: Senator LOTHRIDGE from Washington pipes in, to break it up.
speaker_heading: LOTHRIDGE
dialog: Gentlemen, Mr. Naylor is not here to
dialog: testify on the goings on of the Academy
dialog: of Tobacco Studies. We’re here to
dialog: examine the possibility of a warning
dialog: logo on cigarettes. Now, Mr. Naylor, I
dialog: have to ask out of formality, do you
dialog: believe that smoking cigarettes over
dialog: time can lead to lung cancer and other
dialog: respiratory conditions such as
dialog: emphysema?
dialog: Finistirre rolls his eyes. (What do you think?)
text: A long pause, as Nick searches through everything. The people
text: in this room. The people watching on television. The people
dialog: watching down from heaven.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 106.
text: Finistirre looks up in astonishment as the whole room suddenly
text: bustles with energy. Polly and Bobby Jay exchange glances.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: In fact, I think you’d be hard pressed to
dialog: find someone who really believes that
dialog: cigarettes are not potentially harmful.
dialog: (turns to audience)
dialog: I mean, show of hands...
speaker_heading: LOTHRIDGE
dialog: Mr. Naylor, there is no need for
dialog: theatrics.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I’m sorry, I just don’t see the point in
dialog: a warning label for something people
dialog: already know.
text: Senator DUPREE from Michigan joins in.
speaker_heading: DUPREE
text: The warning symbol is a reminder of the
dialog: dangers of smoking cigarettes.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, if we want to remind people of
dialog: danger, why don’t we slap a skull and
dialog: crossbones on all Boeing Airplanes,
dialog: Senator Lothridge...
text: We notice for the first time, Lothridge’s name plate says (D)
text: WASHINGTON.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: and all Fords, Senator Dupree.
text: Dupree’s name plate says (R) MICHIGAN.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: That’s just ridiculous. The death toll on
dialog: passenger planes and car fatalities
text: doesn’t even skim the surface of
dialog: cigarettes. They don’t even compare.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, this from a Senator who calls
dialog: Vermont, home.
text: Finistirre raises an eyebrow.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: LOTHRIDGE
dialog: I don’t follow, Mr. Naylor.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well the real demonstrated number-one
dialog: killer in America is cholesterol.
text: Still stares. Nick continues.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And here comes Senator Finistirre, whose
dialog: fine state is, I regret to say, clogging
dialog: the nation’s arteries with Vermont
dialog: cheddar cheese. If you want to talk
dialog: numbers, how about the millions of people
dialog: dying of heart attacks. Perhaps Vermont
dialog: cheddar should come with a skull and
dialog: crossbones.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: You little...
text: Lothridge covers Finistirre’s mic so we don’t hear the word,
text: “shit”. Finistirre is fuming. Lothridge cools him down.
text: Nick looks back at Joey who gives him the thumbs up.
speaker_heading: LOTHRIDGE
dialog: Mr. Naylor, we are here to discuss
dialog: cigarettes. Not any other products. Now,
dialog: as discussed earlier, these warning
dialog: labels are not for those who know, but
dialog: rather for those who don’t. What about
dialog: the children?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Gentlemen, it’s called education. It
text: doesn’t come off the side of a cigarette
dialog: carton. It comes from our teachers and
dialog: more importantly our parents. It is every
dialog: parents’ job to warn their children of
dialog: all the dangers of the world, including
dialog: cigarettes. So one day, when they get
dialog: older, they can make an educated choice.
dialog: Not to be corny, but that is what this
dialog: country is supposed to be all about. Some
dialog: say it takes a village to raise a child.
dialog: I disagree. It takes two parents. And
dialog: sometimes, just one.
text: Nick looks back at his son.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I look at my son today, and I can’t help
dialog: think of myself as responsible for his
dialog: growth and his development. And I’m proud
dialog: of that.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: In that case, Mr. Naylor, would you
dialog: condone him smoking?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Of course not, he’s not eighteen. That
dialog: would be illegal.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: Yes, I heard you deliver the same
dialog: response on 20/20. But enough dancing.
dialog: What about when he does turn eighteen?
text: Nick is momentarily speechless.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: Come on Mr. Naylor? On your son’s
dialog: eighteenth birthday, will you share a
dialog: cigarette? Enjoy the afternoon like one
dialog: of those sick tobacco advertisements? You
dialog: certainly have a lot to say on how we
dialog: should raise our children. What of your
dialog: own? What will you do when he turns
dialog: eighteen?
text: Joey looks to his father.
text: Nick looks up at the various senators. He takes a breath.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: If he really wants a cigarette... I’1l
dialog: buy him his first pack.
text: Joey smiles proudly.
text: Finistirre rocks back.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Naylor.
text: Nick nods and stand up to leave. As he does, many of the
text: spectators stand to leave with him out into the...
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN FOYER, CAPITAL BUILDING - DAY
text: Nick, now surrounded by REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, ADMIRERS,
text: and DETRACTORS, tries to make his way outside. Somehow, the
text: crowd separates momentarily and BR squeezes in next to Nick.
speaker_heading: BR
dialog: Well done, my boy!
text: Nick looks over, confused. My boy?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Were you in the same room as me?
speaker_heading: BR
dialog: The whole personal choice thing. They ate
dialog: up that shit. We checked the whip count
dialog: The bill is going down in flames. Your
dialog: speech was... unorthodox, but you did
dialog: it... You crushed the fucker.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That’s great news for you guys.
speaker_heading: BR
dialog: Hey, now. We’re still a team, right?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What about, “damage control”?
text: Nick and BR stop at the MAIN DOORS. The crowd still
text: surrounding them.
speaker_heading: BR
dialog: (levels with him)
dialog: Look, Nick. Winston-Salem is ready to do
dialog: whatever it takes to keep you on board...
text: Nick thinks for a moment, then smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MAIN STEPS, CAPITAL BUILDING - DAY
text: Nick and his son Joey stand on the main steps, surrounded by
text: reporters. Joey looks to his dad with pride.
speaker_heading: REPORTER 1
dialog: Nick, will you continue to fight for
dialog: cigarettes?
text: BR enters and puts his arm around Nick.
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: BR
dialog: Of course he will! This man here is our
dialog: general. We’re not going to just let him
dialog: retire.
speaker_heading: REPORTER 2
dialog: Is that correct, Nick? You’re sticking
dialog: with tobacco?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (smiles, then...)
dialog: Smoking is a personal freedom that is
dialog: enjoyed by countless Americans, and
dialog: although I cannot smoke anymore due to my
dialog: injurious kidnapping, I believe in
dialog: protecting all freedoms...
text: Meanwhile, as Nick continues, we take a look at JOEY. He’s so
text: proud of his dad. So proud, that he opens a pack of MARLBORO
text: REDS and pulls out a cigarette. He takes it between his
text: fingers and raises it to his twelve year old LIPS.
text: Out of the corner of Nick’s eye, he sees his son about to lock
text: onto a cigarette. And before Nick can stop himself, his arm
text: whips down and SLAPS the cigarette out of his son’s mouth.
text: We see this repeat through the eyes of the cameras:
speaker_heading: C-SPAN - SLAP!
speaker_heading: MSNBC - SLAP!
speaker_heading: CNN - SLAP!
speaker_heading: CBS - SLAP!
text: The cigarette flies through the air in super Slo-Mo as:
text: Camera men smile.
text: Videotape rolls.
text: A SATELLITE circles the Earth.
text: Controllers in a TV STUDIO switch to camera A.
text: Multiple TELEVISIONS broadcast the event in a window of an
dialog: electronics shop in Tokyo.
text: And of course... BR’s eyes bulge in horror.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: AND THEN:
text: The cigarette hits the ground. Nothing big. Just drops.
text: P.O.V. - One of the TV cameras. Slightly shaky close-up of the
text: cigarette sitting on the Capital Steps. It looks pathetic.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.0.)
dialog: My father gave me one word of advice
dialog: before he died: Prioritize.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.0.)
dialog: So, what happens to a guy a like me? I
dialog: know what you’re probably thinking...
text: Close of a PAIR OF LOAFERS standing on the ledge of a
text: skyscraper. One foot steps out over the edge, then FREEZES.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.0.)
dialog: No, nothing like that. In fact, not much
dialog: has changed.

scene_heading: INT. ACCESS HOLLYWOOD INTERVIEW - DAY
speaker_heading: NICK (V.0.)
text: Senator Finistirre is still fighting for
dialog: his causes.
text: Finistirre is interviewed by a plastic HOLLYWOOD INTERVIEWER.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: Movies are ruining our children. Every
text: time they see an actor engaging in
dialog: violence, casual sex, or smoking, they
dialog: lose a year on their childhood.
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD INTERVIEWER
dialog: What’s you favorite movie?
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: FINISTIRRE
dialog: Well you can’t mess with a classic. I

text: Penn punches her in the face, leveling her to the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL GAME - DAY
text: Nick is lost in his thoughts.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.0.)
dialog: Not much changes at all.
speaker_heading: POLLY

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: BOBBY JAY
dialog: (complete sincerity)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Wow, I can finally go kill myself a

speaker_heading: BOBBY JAY
dialog: You could kill ten spotted owls.

scene_heading: INT. BOARD ROOM - UNKNOWN COMPANY - DAY

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So, be straight with me. Is it true?
text: Obvious embarrassment and confusion around the table.
speaker_heading: GENTLEMEN 1
dialog: It could be.
speaker_heading: GENTLEMEN 2
dialog: Well, we don’t quite know that. It’s
dialog: complicated.
speaker_heading: GENTLEMEN 3
dialog: Very few cases, really.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look, gentlemen. Practice these words in
