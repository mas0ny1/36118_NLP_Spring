dialog: October 15, 1958. The Radio and Television News Directors
dialog: Association Annual meeting.
text: We're in the wings of the theater. Standing there alone
text: is Edward R. Murrow. He looks slightly ill at ease. He
text: lights a cigarette... he looks at some notes in his hand
text: as we overhear his glowing introduction by the Mc.
text: Cheers and applause as we walk with him to the podium.
text: A long awkward pause.
speaker_heading: MURROW
dialog: This might just do nobody any
dialog: good. At the end of this
dialog: discourse a few people may accuse
dialog: this reporter of fouling his own
dialog: comfortable nest, and your
dialog: organization may be accused of
dialog: having given hospitality to
dialog: heretical and even dangerous
dialog: thoughts.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
text: Close ups of people listening. Smiling. Not aware that
dialog: this is not to be the comfortable acceptance speech you
text: might hear of a retiring employee getting his gold watch.
text: This will become what will later be called "The Box of
text: Lights and Wires Speech”. One of THE MOST IMPORTANT
text: broadcast journalism speeches EVER. It is an attack on
dialog: everyone in this room... an attack on himself. And, at
text: this point, it has just begun.
speaker_heading: MURROW (CONT'D)
dialog: But the elaborate structure of
dialog: Networks, Advertising Agencies and
dialog: Sponsers will not be shaken or
dialog: altered. It is my desire, if not
dialog: my duty, to try to talk to you
text: journeymen with some candor about
dialog: what is happening to radio and
dialog: television. If what I have to say
dialog: is responsible, then I alone am
dialog: responsible for the saying of it.
speaker_heading: MURROW
dialog: Our history will be what we make
dialog: of it. And if there are any
dialog: historians about fifty or a
dialog: hundred years from now, and there
dialog: should be preserved the Kinescopes
dialog: for one week of all three
dialog: networks, they will there find
dialog: recorded in black and white, or
dialog: color, evidence of decadence...
text: escapism, and insulation from the
dialog: realities of the world in which we
dialog: live. We are currently wealthy,
text: fat, comfortable and complacent.
dialog: We have a built in allergy to
dialog: unpleasant or disturbing
dialog: information. Cur mass media
dialog: reflect this. But unless we get up
dialog: off our fat surpluses and
dialog: recognize that television in the
dialog: main is being used to distract,
dialog: delude, amuse and insulate us,
dialog: then television and those who
dialog: finance it, those who look at it
dialog: and those who work at it, may see
dialog: a totally different picture too
dialog: late.

dialog: damning Joe McCarthy and resorting
dialog: to the vilest smears I've ever
dialog: heard. Well? This is the answer.
dialog: And if I could express it in

dialog: do it in the terms of the poet who

speaker_heading: MURROW (CONT’D)
dialog: Earlier, the Senator asked, “Upon
dialog: what meat does this our Caesar
dialog: feed?” Had he looked three lines
dialog: earlier in Shakespeare's “Caesar”
dialog: he would have found this line
dialog: which is not altogether
dialog: inappropriate: “The fault, dear
dialog: Brutus, is not in our stars but in
dialog: ourselves.” No one familiar with
dialog: the history of this country can
dialog: deny that congressional committees
dialog: are useful. It is necessary to
dialog: investigate before legislating,
dialog: but the line between investigating
dialog: and persecuting is a very fine
dialog: one; and the Junior Senator fron
dialog: Wisconsin has stepped over it
dialog: repeatedly. We must not confuse
dialog: dissent with disloyalty. We must
dialog: remember always that accusation is
dialog: not proof and that conviction
dialog: depends upon evidence and due
dialog: process of law. We will not be
text: driven by fear into an age of
dialog: unreason, if we dig deep in our
dialog: history and our doctrine, and
dialog: remember that we are not descended
dialog: from fearful men, not from men who
dialog: feared to write, to speak, to

dialog: freedom abroad by deserting it at
dialog: home. The actions of the Junior
dialog: Senator from Wisconsin have caused
dialog: alarm and dismay amongst our
dialog: allies abroad and given
dialog: considerable comfort to our
dialog: enemies. And, whose fault is
dialog: that? Not really his. He didn’t
dialog: create this situation of fear, he

dialog: Last week, Senator McCarthy
dialog: appeared on this program to
dialog: correct any errors he might have
dialog: thought we made in our report of
dialog: March 9th. Since he made no
dialog: veference to any statements of
dialog: fact that we made, we must
dialog: conclude that he found no errors
dialog: of fact. He proved again that
dialog: anyone who exposes him, anyone who
dialog: dees not share his hysterical
dialog: disregard to decency and human
dialog: dignity and the rights guaranteed
dialog: by the Constitution must be either
text: a Communist or a fellow traveler.
dialog: I fully expected this treatment.
dialog: The Senator added this reporter's
dialog: name to a long list of individuals
dialog: and institutions he has accused of
dialog: serving the communist cause, His
dialog: proposition is very simple:
dialog: Anyone who criticizes or opposes
dialog: McCarthy's methods must be a
dialog: Communist. And if that be true,
dialog: there are an awful lot of
dialog: Communists in this country. For
dialog: the record, let’s consider briefly

dialog: they’re too complacent,
dialog: indifferent and insulated, I can
dialog: only reply- there is, in one
dialog: reporter's opinion, considerable
dialog: evidence against that contention.
dialog: But even if they are right, what
dialog: have they got to lose? Because if
dialog: they are right, and this
