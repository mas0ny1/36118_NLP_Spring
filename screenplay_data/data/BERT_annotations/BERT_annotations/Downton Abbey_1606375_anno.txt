dialog: Based on the television series created by Julian Fellowes
text: MONTAGE UNDER CREDITS.
text: In a gilded room a crested letter is signed and placed inside
text: a leather satchel to be carried away by a liveried official.
text: At King’s Cross Station, silhouetted men load the mail bags
dialog: on to the night train. Further down, a man we will later know
text: as Major Chetwode walks through the steam to climb aboard.
text: Out of a burst of more steam the train thunders through the
text: darkness. Chetwode finds his compartment. Inside a dimly lit
text: carriage, postal workers sort the post into pigeon holes. A
text: man pauses as he finds our letter. The train continues
text: through the countryside as day breaks. At dawn, we follow a
text: royal mail van, winding its way through a waking Downton
text: village until it stops by the post office. The letter lands
text: on the counter where it attracts attention. A postman on a
text: GPO motorcycle takes us to our first view of the iconic
text: house, bathed in the morning light. When Andy opens the back
text: door, the postman holds up one envelope in particular.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Morning.
speaker_heading: POSTMAN
dialog: Special one today.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Blimey!
text: He takes it, with the rest of the post and starts down the
text: kitchen passage. He is unusually dignified in his manner.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: What have you got there?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Wouldn't you like to know?
text: He sweeps on, leaving Mrs Patmore and Daisy to register his
text: air of importance. Andy gives the letters to Thomas, who
text: raises his brows, picks up a salver and starts up the stairs.
scene_heading: END MONTAGE.
scene_heading: INT. HALL/DINING ROOM. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Robert is coming down with the dog Teo as Thomas enters the
text: hall. He stops to take the letters from the salver.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Just arrived, m’lord. There’s one
dialog: from Buckingham Palace.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Heavens.
text: He walks into the dining room. We hear Mary speaking.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But we really need to cut back
dialog: until the farms repay the
dialog: investment. And we must make a plan
dialog: for the roof.
text: Robert is reading the letter, standing by the sideboard.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Well, this won't help us to
dialog: economise.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: The King and Queen are coming to
dialog: stay.
text: He helps himself.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What? During their Yorkshire tour?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: That's it. Just for a night.
dialog: They'll spend one night at Downton
dialog: and then go on to Harewood for a
dialog: ball. While they're here, there's
dialog: to be a parade of the Yorkshire
text: Hussars in the village. Is there
dialog: any chance Henry might be back?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I doubt it. I'll send a telegram.
dialog: But there's a motor show in Chicago
dialog: that I know he cannot chuck.
text: Robert sits to eat and gives some bacon to Teo.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Tom, you're keeping your enthusiasm
dialog: under control. Is this the Irish
dialog: patriot making a reappearance?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I know you find my opinions highly
dialog: entertaining.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I suppose they'll send people to
dialog: check that Mrs Patmore isn't a
dialog: Russian spy. Will you tell them
dialog: downstairs, Barrow? I'll see to Her
dialog: Ladyship.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Yes, m'lord.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN/KITCHEN PASSAGE. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Mrs Hughes and Mrs Patmore are with Daisy and Andy.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
text: A Royal luncheon, a parade and a
dialog: dinner? I'm going to have to sit
dialog: down. What about Mr Branson?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Well, he’s a Republican, isn’t he?
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Should Mr Carson look in, no one is
text: to say that word in front of him.
text: She walks out, into the kitchen passage.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I agree with Mr Branson. I don't
dialog: like kings either. I suppose that
dialog: makes me a republican too.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Are the English allowed to be?

speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: It's quite an honour.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: It is. But if I know anything about
dialog: Royal visits, we will never stop
dialog: changing our clothes.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: I've just been on a buying spree,

speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Madame Handley-Seymour is making me
dialog: a ball dress, so I'll get her to
dialog: hurry it up.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Have her send it here. How are
dialog: things otherwise?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Oh, you know. I've got a luncheon
dialog: for thirty today in aid of the
dialog: lifeboats. Or is that tomorrow?
dialog: Anyway, it's in aid of something.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Sounds like business as usual. I'll

scene_heading: EXT. THE CARSONS’ COTTAGE. DAY.
text: Carson works on a vegetable patch. Mrs Hughes joins him.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: You know I can bring back as many
dialog: vegetables as we could eat.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I like to keep busy. How have they
dialog: taken the news up at the house?
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
text: Daisy's singing "The Marseillaise",
dialog: so no surprises there. What's the
dialog: matter? I thought you'd be pleased.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I am pleased. The visit is a great
dialog: honour. But members of the Royal
dialog: and Imperial Household are coming
dialog: to Downton who will have visited
dialog: the greatest houses in the land.
dialog: Blenheim, Chatsworth, Arundel. Does
dialog: Mr Barrow know what he's taking on?
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Why should it affect you? You're
dialog: not in charge anymore. Now come in
dialog: for your lunch and let me get back.

speaker_heading: LANDLADY
dialog: All right, sir. Here we are.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: This will do very well. Thank you.

speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: Good. We'll go to the 1844 room as

speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I've just received the plan for the
dialog: tour of Yorkshire, ma'am.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: Yes. It's just been finalised. I
dialog: think we'll enjoy it.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I didn't realise we would be
dialog: staying at Downton Abbey.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: Only for a night. There's to be a
dialog: parade and a dinner and then we go
dialog: on to Princess Mary at Harewood.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I just wondered if I might,
dialog: perhaps, go straight to Harewood.
text: Queen Mary is rather surprised.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Lord Grantham is my cousin and the
dialog: two families have... fallen out. Or
dialog: at least we might if I were there
dialog: in person.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: And what would cause this quarrel?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Lord Grantham's mother believes her
dialog: son should be my heir.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: Old Lady Grantham can be very hard
dialog: to resist, as I am well aware.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Exactly, ma'am.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: But surely they need to know if
dialog: their hopes are to be disappointed.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DOWNTON. EVE.
text: Mrs Patmore is with Daisy, Anna and Mrs Hughes.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: I wish I knew if they like simple
dialog: food or fancy.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I can't think they'll want simple
dialog: food. With that sort, don't they
dialog: like sauces and everything velouté
dialog: and frappé and smothered in cream?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: "That sort"? He's the King of
dialog: England! There's only one of them
dialog: in the world. "That sort" indeed!
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Don't plan too much. Not until we
dialog: know what's expected.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Well, I know what's expected of me--
dialog: food. You too, Daisy. So less
dialog: philosophy, more elbow grease.
text: Andy enters with an empty tray. He heard this.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Is the pudding ready?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
text: It is. Daisy take the soufflés out
text: of the oven while I find my specs.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: This country needs a shake-up.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You should run for Parliament.
text: Daisy scoffs.
speaker_heading: ANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Why not? Lady Astor's done it.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: And so an under cook from Yorkshire
text: is bound to follow her.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You've got to have big dreams.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: But do you have big dreams, Andy?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I've not offended you, have I?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Well, for a start, you never talk
dialog: about the wedding anymore.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: We'll get wed when we're good and
dialog: ready and not before.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: But, you see, I am ready.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Take those up before they collapse.
text: He goes. Mrs Patmore has been listening.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. DOWNTON. EVE.
text: Andy and Thomas serve. Violet, Isobel and Merton are among
dialog: the party.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Maud Bagshaw is coming to Downton?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Yes, as the Queen's lady-in-
dialog: waiting.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh, my goodness.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Why so surprised? Who is she?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: She's a cousin of your father's.
text: Violet hesitates slightly. She glances at Thomas and Andy.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: We'll discuss it later.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You're not to make things awkward.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: How's it all going?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Mary's got it under control.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hardly. There's so much to do.
speaker_heading: MERTON
dialog: Who were those men measuring on the
dialog: green as we came past?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: They're building the dais for the
text: Queen at the parade.
speaker_heading: MERTON
dialog: How exciting.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: It seems rather a waste of money.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Here we go.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Isn't that what the Monarchy's for?
dialog: To brighten the lives of the Nation
dialog: with stateliness and glamour?
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: To quote Tennyson, "Kind hearts are
dialog: more than coronets, And simple
dialog: faith than Norman blood."
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Will you have enough clichés to get
dialog: you through the visit?
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: If not, I'll come to you.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: They have their coffee and other drinks and the servants
text: leave them. Teo is lying by the fire. Violet sits in state.
speaker_heading: MERTON
dialog: And now, you were going to tell us
dialog: about Lady Bagshaw. Is she a very
dialog: distant cousin?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: No. Her father was my great-uncle.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Then why have I never heard of her?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Because she chose to cut herself
text: off from the family.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Do you know the reason?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Maybe. I believe she means to cheat
dialog: your father of his rightful
dialog: inheritance. She has no children.
dialog: Your father is her nearest
dialog: relation.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I won't have her put on the spot.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: You're plotting something. I see a
dialog: Machiavellian look in your eye.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Machiavelli is frequently
dialog: underrated. He had many qualities.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: So did Caligula, not all of them
dialog: charming.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What are you up to, Granny?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Ideally, I would like Maud to see
dialog: your father as the son she never
dialog: had.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Will she be the mother I never had?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.

speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Mr Molesley, it's very late for you

text: Molesley is breathless.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: Is it true?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Is what true, Mr Molesley?
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: Mr Bakewell said that you'd warned
dialog: him that there was to be a Royal
dialog: visit.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Well, now I know who not to trust
text: with a secret.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: That we should deserve such honour!
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Not you too. I am disappointed.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Ignore her.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: I wonder, do you think I might be
dialog: allowed to slip on my livery again?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Would the school let you?
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: They'll give me time for this, I
dialog: promise.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Let's wait ‘til we know our orders.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: What about it, Mr Barrow? Will you
dialog: let me wait upon my King and Queen?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Uh, well--
text: Bell rings.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: That’s us.
text: He is stumped for words. Anna has taken in his terror.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Good night, Mr Molesley
text: Molesley goes, flabbergasted. Bates stands.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: When we're done, shall I fetch
dialog: Johnnie, or will you?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I can fetch him.
text: They leave. Daisy and Mrs Patmore are left alone.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: How exciting.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: They're all mental. All this fuss
dialog: for a man and woman we don't even
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Never mind that. I wanted to tell
dialog: you: I've had some ideas about what
dialog: to serve at your wedding.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Stop going on about my wedding.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. MONTAGE. DOWNTON. DAY.

dialog: be coming over from Raby Castle
text: with a lady's maid and a valet.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: To give us our instructions?
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: With the Royal servants, are we to

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: That is what will be made clear.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I won't be waiting on any valets
dialog: and lady's maids, thank you very

speaker_heading: BRANSON

speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: It's really you I came to see.
text: He is a British officer type, in tweeds, with a slight drawl.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: How can I help you, Mr...?
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: Chetwode. Major Chetwode. Am I
dialog: right, you're Mr Branson, Lord
dialog: Grantham's son-in-law?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I am.
text: Chetwode nods. It is hard to tell where this is going.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: The papers tell me the King and

dialog: Abbey during their tour of
dialog: Yorkshire.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Well, if it's in the papers, it
dialog: must be true.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: Yes, a great honour. Although, as
dialog: an Irishman, you may feel
dialog: differently.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I know when my parents-in-law have
dialog: been paid a compliment.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: There's to be a military parade, I
dialog: gather. How do you feel about that?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: What do you mean, "how do I feel"?
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: Only you didn't say whether you
dialog: support them. The King and Queen.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I support Lord Grantham.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: Very neat. Until we meet again, Mr

scene_heading: INT. THE SILVER PANTRY. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Thomas is staring at a vast display of silver. Mary enters.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Ah, Barrow. They said you'd be in
dialog: here. Heavens! We can still put on
dialog: quite a show when we need to, I'm
dialog: glad to see. Has it all been
dialog: cleaned?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: More or less everything's been done
dialog: to a basic level, m'lady, but we
dialog: haven't done the final buffing-up.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I was waiting for Their Majesties'
dialog: butler. I thought I'd ask his
dialog: advice on what to use on the table.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Really? Can't we decide what we lay
dialog: on our own dining table?

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: This way, Mr Wilson.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Mary enters, taking Caroline from the nanny. The family is

speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Oh, dear. Should I go down?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: They know what they're doing.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: Do they? They're hideously behind.
text: There's a mark on the Blue Room
dialog: carpet we can't shift, I have no
dialog: chairs for the parade, and we
dialog: haven't even decided on the
dialog: footmen.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I'm going to have another cup, if
text: no one's coming up to serve.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: This is nice. Princess Mary wants
dialog: us for tea tomorrow at Harewood.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I've got so much to do.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I wonder if that means the young
dialog: couple have taken over the big
dialog: house?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: They're hardly the "young couple".
dialog: Well, he isn't anyway.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: She always seems quite shy to me.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: A shy Royal? Is that an oxymoron?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Anyway, we're going.
scene_heading: INT. SERVANTS’ HALL. DOWNTON. DAY.

speaker_heading: WILSON

dialog: Their Majesties on Thursday. But
dialog: His Majesty's valet, Mr Ellis, and
dialog: Her Majesty's dresser, Miss Lawton,
dialog: will stay on, if that is
dialog: convenient. Or they can put up in
dialog: the village.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: No, we'll find them rooms.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Then Monsieur Courbet, the chef--
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Excuse me, "Mr Courbet, the chef"?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: That's right. We'd be very grateful
dialog: if you could make the kitchens
dialog: ready.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: So what should I order?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Nothing. He will bring it all.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: And we don't cook any of the food?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Cook for the servants. Monsieur
dialog: Courbet won't have time for that.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Oh, I say! That is something to
dialog: look forward to!
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Calm yourself, Mrs Patmore. If it's

speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Mrs Webb and four footmen will
dialog: arrive with Monsieur Courbet the

speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Who is this... Mrs Webb, is it?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: She is the housekeeper. She will

speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: The housekeeper?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: While Their Majesties are here.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: And the maids?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: They will make the beds, clean the
dialog: bathrooms, that sort of thing.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: I see. So my maids and I will not
dialog: be involved in the preparations?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You mean, during the stay you'll be
dialog: the butler, and--
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Excuse me. I am not a butler. I am
text: the King's Page of the Backstairs.
text: They almost reel. Daisy rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: So our staff has nothing to do.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I'm sure they can be useful.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: How can they eat and get dressed at
dialog: Raby Castle if the chef and the
dialog: valet and the maid are all here?
dialog: 17.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: We have two of each. The principal
dialog: valet and the principal dresser
dialog: will arrive in advance of Their
text: Majesties, who bring an equerry, a
text: lady-in-waiting, two detectives and
text: two chauffeurs. The other chef goes
text: from Raby to Harewood. Four footmen
dialog: go with him and the other four come
dialog: here. Do you all understand me?
dialog: No, judging by their expressions.

speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: Oh, and you're an expert in the

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I am an expert in every matter.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: You must have some idea why she
dialog: doesn't want Robert as her heir.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I have none. He is her closest
dialog: relative. The family have held
dialog: Brompton for three centuries. But
dialog: she wants to give it to who?
dialog: Charity? The dogs' home?
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: I would have thought the family had

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That's not the point.

speaker_heading: ISOBEL

dialog: What possible reasons can there be?
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: That's what I intend to find out.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. THE CARSONS’ COTTAGE. DAY.
text: Carson is with Mrs Hughes. There’s a knock. Mary is outside.
text: He leads her inside.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Carson.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: M'lady. Please, come in. This is an
dialog: honour.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don't want to be a nuisance, but
dialog: I need your help, Carson. Barrow
dialog: just isn't up to the task.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: M' lady?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: He won't clean the silver. Or he
dialog: won't let Andrew clean it.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: He says the page of the...
dialog: thingummy will choose which pieces
dialog: to use.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: The truth is, he's in a sort of
dialog: trance. Won't you help me? I feel
dialog: I'm pushing a rock uphill.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I'll be there in the morning,
dialog: m'lady. Don't you worry.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You're a treasure, Carson. That's
dialog: all there is to say. I'll see
dialog: myself out.
text: She slips away.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: You could never refuse her
dialog: anything. And what about Mr Barrow?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Mr Barrow can like it or lump it.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Then I'm afraid he'll lump it.
text: Carson sits, pleased.
scene_heading: INT. MENSERVANTS’ BEDROOM CORRIDOR/ELLIS’ ROOM. EVE.
text: Thomas leads Ellis to his room.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: We have supper after the upstairs
dialog: dinner, so you've plenty of time.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: How does it work with two valets?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I prepare His Majesty's clothes and
dialog: uniforms for Downton. Then, when Mr
dialog: Miller arrives, I get the stuff for
text: Harewood ready. Then I head back to
dialog: London and prepare for their
text: return. It all overlaps.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: So, Mr Miller's the one who
dialog: actually dresses the King?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Unless he's ill. Then it's me.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Is he often ill?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No.
text: Which makes them both laugh.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN/KITCHEN PASSAGE. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Mrs Patmore is by the sink. Daisy is with her.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I think it's rubbish. They impose,
dialog: they demand, and now we're to be
dialog: made nothing in our own house.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: It's very disappointing, I won't
dialog: deny it. This water's not too hot.
dialog: Have they all been having baths?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: How should I know?
dialog: 21.
text: She walks into the passage where Anna and Bates are waiting.
text: Bates carries their little boy. Thomas is coming downstairs.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Mr Barrow, don't you think you
dialog: should speak to His Lordship?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Well, it's not right, surely, for
dialog: us to be humiliated in this way.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What could he do about it?
text: He walks off.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is the staff always ridden over
dialog: roughshod whenever Royalty come to
dialog: stay? Why do they bring so many
dialog: servants with them?
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Maybe it's because they go from
dialog: house to house around the county
dialog: and they need to know things are
dialog: done the way they like.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: As if we couldn't manage that.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: We're not footballs, Mr Bates, and
dialog: we don't deserve a kicking.
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PARK. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Carson strides purposefully up the drive, like a proud king
text: returning to claim his throne.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Robert is with Mary.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: But what are we to say to Barrow?
dialog: After all, he's done nothing wrong.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: He's done nothing at all. That's
dialog: the problem.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: But it feels very unfair.
text: Carson enters the library, clearing his throat to announce
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, I see. So it's now.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I've sent down for Mr Barrow to
dialog: join us, m'lord.
text: The door opens and Thomas comes in.
dialog: The sound
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You wanted to see me, m'lord? Mr
dialog: Carson! What brings you here?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Well, this is the thing...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Carson is going to move back into
dialog: the house for the Royal visit.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What?
text: of the word is very bald. He stares at Carson.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: You are coming back here as butler,
dialog: when I am the butler here?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Yes, that is--
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Can I ask how long this has been
dialog: planned, m'lord?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I wouldn't say it's been exactly
dialog: planned.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Because I don't quite understand
dialog: where it leaves me.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Well, you can be a sort of--
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: With your permission, I'd prefer
dialog: not to be a "sort of" anything,
dialog: m'lord. I will surrender my
dialog: position for the duration of the
dialog: visit, if I must, and serve you
dialog: again when Their Majesties have
dialog: gone, if you so wish.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Please don't think that--
text: But Thomas has made up his mind. He walks towards the door.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
text: By the way, the boiler's playing up
dialog: and there's no hot water.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: God, that's all we need.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Now, Barrow--
text: He leaves in a white rage, more or less slamming the door.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Not to worry. The plumber will soon
dialog: have it mended, m'lady, and we'll
dialog: bring water jugs up to the bedrooms
dialog: tonight and in the morning. It
dialog: can't be that hard. We did it for
dialog: three hundred years.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Thank you, Carson. Well, that went
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Will you sack him?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: No. As a matter of fact, I was
dialog: quite interested. I never thought
dialog: of him as a man of principle
dialog: before.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE. DAY.
text: A new day. Mrs Patmore and Daisy are on the pavement.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: I'll have to tell him I'm only
text: ordering for the servants' hall.
dialog: I'm afraid I've got his hopes up.
text: They walk into Mr Bakewell’s shop.
scene_heading: INT. BAKEWELL’S SHOP. DOWNTON VILLAGE. DAY.
dialog: 24.
text: Mr Bakewell is serving Molesley. He is delighted to see her.
speaker_heading: BAKEWELL
dialog: Speak of the devil! Come in, come
dialog: in. I was just saying you'll be
dialog: wanting to finalise the order.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Were you, indeed?
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: Honestly, no one in the village can
dialog: talk about anything else!
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: BAKEWELL
dialog: I know it's a bit of a liberty, but
dialog: I've made a list of all the
dialog: ingredients of your favourite
dialog: dishes. I know them well enough
dialog: after all these years, but some
dialog: things will have to be brought in,
dialog: so we should really get on with it.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: I appreciate everything you've
dialog: done, Mr Bakewell--
text: Mr Bakewell laughs.
speaker_heading: BAKEWELL
dialog: My heart is fit to burst, I don't
dialog: mind telling you. I shall have fed
dialog: the King Emperor from my own shop.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: BAKEWELL (CONT'D)
dialog: If only my father were alive. He'd
dialog: be so proud of me. He would.
text: He is almost crying.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: I'm sure he'd be proud of you
dialog: anyway, Mr Bakewell.
speaker_heading: BAKEWELL
dialog: Oh, no, not like this. No. This is
dialog: the peak of my career. The peak of
dialog: my life, really. Everyone's so
dialog: jealous. Now, I've put ticks next
dialog: to the ones I think you'll go for.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: The thing is--
speaker_heading: BAKEWELL
dialog: I'm guessing the luncheon will be
dialog: for around a dozen? Of course, the
dialog: dinner will be larger. Let's say
dialog: thirty or thereabouts? You'll
dialog: correct me if I'm wrong.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Well, you see--
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You're not wrong, Mr Bakewell. But
dialog: we'll say if the numbers change.
text: Mrs Patmore stares at her but Daisy is defiant.
speaker_heading: DAISY (CONT'D)
dialog: The pavlova's not realistic. We'd
dialog: be safer with a charlotte russe. We
dialog: can do most of the work before.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: And I shall be serving! Think of
dialog: that!
text: He bursts into song, waltzing with Mrs Patmore.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: (sings)
dialog: I've danced with a man who's danced
text: with a girl who's danced with the
dialog: Prince of Wales
dialog: I'm crazy with excitement,
text: completely off the rails
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: BAKEWELL
dialog: All of my suppliers are so excited.
dialog: Oh, Mrs Patmore, I shall never be
dialog: able to thank you enough. Not if I
dialog: live to be a hundred.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE. DAY.
text: They emerge from the shop doorway and walk away.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: I feel like a liar. I should go
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: And lower yourself to a kitchen
dialog: skivvy in the eyes of the village?
dialog: Never mind ruining Mr Bakewell's
dialog: year. You'll do no such thing.
text: She stamps off. Mrs Patmore hesitates.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Robert, Cora, Mary, Andy, Albert, Carson and Mrs Hughes watch
text: as a car comes to a halt. Edith, Bertie and Marigold climb
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: No maid, no valet, no nanny, even.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It's nineteen twenty-seven. We're
dialog: modern folk.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Nanny will take care of Marigold.
dialog: And Anna can look after you.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Really? Can she?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Of course. Just like the old days.
dialog: Granny's here, and Isobel, and
dialog: we're paying a call this afternoon
dialog: on Princess Mary.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Has my new ball dress arrived?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Not yet, but it will.
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: INT. BOOT ROOM. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: The Queen’s dresser, Lawton, is cleaning shoes with Anna.
text: Bates is in there, polishing a pair of Robert's.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: How long have you worked for Her
dialog: Majesty, Miss Lawton?
speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: Six years.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: How interesting. I expect you're a
dialog: skilled needlewoman for that job.
text: Lawton’s pitying, smug smile confirms the truth of this.
speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: I've had no complaints. I trained
dialog: under Madame Lucile. Her Majesty
dialog: wanted a professional dressmaker.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And they found you?
speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: My reputation found me.
text: Anna catches Bates’ eye. He giggles. Lawton doesn’t notice.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: The end of luncheon. Carson is supervising. Cora stands.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Come on, you two, it's nearly
dialog: three. We ought to get ready.
speaker_heading: MERTON
dialog: Will the Princess be at the parade?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: They both will.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: I always find her rather sad,
dialog: Princess Mary.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: She is Royal. Royal women are not
text: meant to grin like Cheshire cats.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: They don't have to look miserable.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: To you she looks miserable. To me
text: she looks dignified.
speaker_heading: MERTON
dialog: Doesn't that say it all?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: How comforting to see you here,
dialog: Carson. What prompted you to take
dialog: up the flaming sword again?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I felt I should go where I could do
dialog: the most good, m'lady.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Wise words for all of us.
text: They have risen now and they are leaving the room.
scene_heading: EXT. HAREWOOD HOUSE. YORKSHIRE. DAY.
text: The splendid palace sits comfortably in its setting. A car
text: drives up. The three women walk from their car to the
dialog: entrance.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. HAREWOOD HOUSE. DAY.
text: A footman announces the family. They have shed their coats
text: but retained their hats and they carry their gloves.
speaker_heading: FOOTMAN
dialog: The Marchioness of Hexham, the
dialog: Countess of Grantham, the Lady Mary
dialog: Talbot.
text: They advance towards a rather sad-looking woman of thirty,
text: near the fire. They sink into deep court curtseys.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Your Royal Highness.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: Please, sit down, Lady Grantham. I
dialog: suppose you're in turmoil because
dialog: of my parents' visit. I do
dialog: sympathise.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: We don't need to explain it to you.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: Just don't paint anything. They're
text: sick of the smell of new paint.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I hope it's not too late.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Are you living here now, ma'am?
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: No, we're still at Goldsborough.
dialog: But Lord Harewood's not well, so
dialog: we've come to run the visit and the
dialog: ball.
text: The door opens and a nanny appears with two boys, aged four
text: and three. The Princess opens her arms. The boys run to her.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY (CONT’D)
dialog: Hello, my darlings! How have you
dialog: been? Have you been having a lovely
dialog: day?
text: Her face lights up which all the Crawley women notice.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN/KITCHEN PASSAGE. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Daisy is working when a young man enters. He’s very handsome.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: SELLICK
dialog: This is your lucky day. I'm the new
dialog: plumber, Tony Sellick.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Oh, yes. Right. Well, I'd better
dialog: show you where the boiler is.
text: She is flustered, as she starts to go, when Andy appears.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Where are you off to?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: This is Mr Sellick, the plumber.
dialog: I'm taking him to the boiler house.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I’1l do it.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: No, you're all right. Just tell Mrs
dialog: Patmore where I am.
text: She and Sellick leave. Andy is none too pleased.
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. HAREWOOD. DAY.
text: They have been served tea. The nanny plays with the boys.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Please bring the boys on Thursday.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: Oh, how lovely!
speaker_heading: LASCELLES
dialog: Why are the children in here?
text: The Princess' husband has entered the room. The nanny
text: stutters.
scene_heading: HAREWOOD NANNY
dialog: We just got back and they wanted to-
speaker_heading: LASCELLES
dialog: They're not allowed in the drawing
text: room before six.
scene_heading: HAREWOOD NANNY
dialog: I know, m'lord. But they-
speaker_heading: LASCELLES
dialog: Take them upstairs. And don't bring
dialog: them down again tonight.
scene_heading: HAREWOOD NANNY
dialog: Yes, m'lord.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: But they were only-
speaker_heading: LASCELLES
dialog: Thank you, Nanny.
text: The boys are led out by their nurse.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: You remember Lady Grantham and her
dialog: daughters?
speaker_heading: LASCELLES
dialog: Lady Grantham.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: They want us to bring the boys to
dialog: the parade.
speaker_heading: LASCELLES
dialog: No. They'd only cause a ruckus.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: We were hoping you would both stay
dialog: for dinner that night, Lord
dialog: Lascelles.
speaker_heading: LASCELLES
dialog: No, I'm afraid not. Well, I'll
dialog: leave you to it.
dialog: 31.
text: All of which seems oddly rude. He goes and closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. BOILER ROOM. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Sellick and Daisy survey the boiler.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Well, I suppose I'd better let you
dialog: get started. So I'll be on my way.
speaker_heading: TONY SELLICK
dialog: Aren't you going to wish me luck?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You don't look as if you need me to
dialog: wish you luck, Mr Sellick. Or
dialog: anyone else, for that matter.
speaker_heading: TONY SELLICK
dialog: You don't know what I need.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: And I don't intend to find out.
text: He smiles as she goes, blushing at her own boldness.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE GREEN. DAY.
text: Bertie and Branson cross the green to look at the finished

text: bunting.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Do we need to cut the grass again?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: They're doing it tomorrow morning.
text: But a man is coming towards him. It is Major
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: Hello, Mr Branson. Getting ready
dialog: for Their Majesties, I see.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: That’s right. This is Lord Hexham.
dialog: May I present Major Chetwode.
dialog: Chetwode.
dialog: 32.
text: Bertie shakes his hand.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Are you here for the parade?
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: I am. I'm staying at the pub.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Bertie goes to talk to the workman. Branson comes closer.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Or are you here to keep an eye on
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: I was rather hoping you'd be my
dialog: guide for the ceremony. Would you
dialog: like a drink?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I'll join you in a minute.
text: Chetwode walks off towards the King’s Arms.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Who’s he?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I don't really know. Army, perhaps.
dialog: Or maybe a civil servant. But I'll
dialog: drink with him and try and put his
dialog: mind at rest.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What does he want?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Maybe to make sure I'm a leopard
text: who has changed his spots.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON. EVE.
text: The darkening sky is filled with clouds.
speaker_heading: ANNA (V.O.)
dialog: What about you, m'lady? Is

scene_heading: INT. MARY’S BEDROOM. DOWNTON. EVE.
text: Mary is dressing for dinner with Anna’s help.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No. And my heart is pounding. By
dialog: the way, have you seen the silver
text: box from the table by the fire in
dialog: the drawing room? My grandmother
dialog: used to keep playing cards in it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I know the one. Is it missing?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes. And so is the little cupid
text: from the mantelshelf. They must
dialog: have been taken downstairs for
dialog: cleaning.
text: The door opens and Edith enters, changed.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I was just coming to you, m'lady.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Oh, don't worry. I'm fine.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: If that's all, m'lady?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I suppose. Can you manage the jug
dialog: and basin? Or are they too heavy?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, no. I can do it.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: How's the boiler?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm sure they'll fix it soon.
text: She takes the jug and the china basin and goes.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Bertie was with Tom earlier.
text: Mary looks at her, curious. Edith ploughs on.
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't think Tom would ever...
dialog: try to make trouble?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Bertie says there's some army type
text: who has him under surveillance.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Tom likes to shock, that's all.
dialog: He'd never be disloyal to this
dialog: family. Never. Shall we go down?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Yes, let's.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Sellick, the plumber and raconteur, is there while dinner is
text: being served upstairs. Daisy pours tea for him.
speaker_heading: SELLICK
dialog: So I said to her, "Listen, lady,
dialog: there's a little one here who still
dialog: needs turning."
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Oh! Careful, Mr Sellick, you'll
dialog: make Daisy blush.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Takes more than that to make me
dialog: blush. Now get that down you.
text: But she is smiling up at him as she gives him the tea.
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: You deserve that. It's very late.
speaker_heading: SELLICK
dialog: Well, I've got to get it done. And
dialog: I don't mind long hours. I mean to
dialog: build my own business and you can't
dialog: do that working nine to five.
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: These water jugs nearly killed me.
dialog: How did we manage in the old days?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Maybe people were tougher then.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Maybe they expected less from life.
speaker_heading: SELLICK
dialog: Well, I expect a lot from life.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: So do I. And I mean to have it,
dialog: too.
text: He laughs, admiringly.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Are you still here?
text: He is carrying a tray. How long was he watching?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Mr Sellick's been working hard for
dialog: hours for our benefit, Andy.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Then it's time he went home. Is the
dialog: savoury ready?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Take this.
text: Andy collects the tray of savouries and goes.
speaker_heading: SELLICK
dialog: He's right. The new pump should
dialog: arrive around nine. I'll be here.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: So will we.
speaker_heading: SELLICK
dialog: Ta-ra!
text: Sellick puts down his cup, walks to the door and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Robert pours some whisky as Cora appears.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: That was Mama. She's in London.
text: She's staying with Rosamund.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: She can't be. She was here for
text: lunch. She didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: She went up this afternoon. She'll
dialog: be back tomorrow, so I've asked her
dialog: to come for tea. You must persuade
text: her to leave Maud Bagshaw alone.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I don't believe even Mama will pick
text: a quarrel in front of the King.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I wonder if he can come early.
text: They laugh.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Are you excited?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I am a bit. Are you?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Would it be common to admit it?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Not to an American.
text: And with that he takes her in his arms and kisses her.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. MONTAGE. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Gardeners trim the grass and rake the paths. Others clean the

scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON. DAY.

speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Here we go, Mr Carson.
speaker_heading: CARSON

text: Mrs Webb, the housekeeper.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Ah. Follow that path and it'll take
dialog: you into the kitchen courtyard.
speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: I said, I am Monsieur Courbet, chef

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You've seen many that are finer.

speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)

text: Lawton leads the way out.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DOWNTON. DAY.

speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: You. Where can I put this?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Don't tempt me.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: We've cleared some space in the
dialog: scullery. And that cupboard.
text: She rolls her eyes at Mrs Patmore and murmurs.
speaker_heading: DAISY (CONT'D)
dialog: What a lot of fuss over nothing!
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Where's our order from Mr Bakewell?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Follow me.
scene_heading: INT. CUPBOARD. DOWNTON. CONTINUOUS.
text: She leads the way down the crowded passage to a door, pushes
text: Mrs Patmore in and turns on a light. The cupboard is packed.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: How did you manage it?
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: A gardener helped me carry
dialog: everything in, so no one saw.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: I suppose you could sell the lot
dialog: and use the money to pay Mr
dialog: Bakewell.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Don't worry. They can eat it
text: gradual when the visit's over.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN PASSAGE. CONTINUOUS.
text: As they emerge, Tony Sellick walks towards them.
speaker_heading: SELLICK
dialog: It's done, Mrs Patmore. The new
text: pump's installed.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Hail the conquering hero!
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It's Mrs Hughes you should be
dialog: telling. Or Mr Carson. Not them.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: It's all right, Mr Sellick. We'll
dialog: see the news gets through. Thanks.
text: Sellick leaves as Daisy rounds on Andy. They pass Mrs Hughes,
text: engaged in a row with Mrs Webb.
speaker_heading: MRS WEBB
dialog: But I don't need your help, Mrs
dialog: Hughes. I just want to know where
text: Their Majesties are sleeping so
text: Miss Stinson can prepare the rooms.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Then I will show you, Mrs Webb.
dialog: Because, without my help, you will
dialog: not find them.
text: She is livid.
scene_heading: INT. BOOT ROOM. DOWNTON. CONTINUOUS.
text: Baxter, Anna and Thomas are with Ellis.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is it always like this?
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
text: A Royal visit is like a swan on a
text: lake. Grace and serenity above,
text: demented kicking down below.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I wish I could get away.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I've got tomorrow night off when Mr
dialog: Miller arrives. I told my mum I'd
dialog: look in. Why don't you come to York
dialog: with me? We could have a drink.
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: You should go. You're not on duty.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: That settles it, then. I'll come
dialog: find you when I'm released. We can
dialog: borrow a car.
text: Ellis leaves them. By now, a fight has broken out in the
dialog: passage.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Mrs Webb, I am the housekeeper
dialog: here.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN PASSAGE. DOWNTON. CONTINUOUS.
speaker_heading: MRS WEBB
dialog: You are not housekeeper so long as
dialog: His Majesty is under this roof.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: But he's not here yet, is he?
scene_heading: INT. HALL. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Robert, with Teo, walks through the hall as servants scrub
dialog: and clean every surface.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Robert, Edith and Bertie join the others for tea. The
text: children are there.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: It's like living in a factory.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It reminds me of our days as a
text: convalescent home during the war.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I enjoyed that, although I always
dialog: feel guilty saying so. Where's Tom?
speaker_heading: SYBBIE
dialog: Daddy's in the village.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Again? What's he playing at?
text: Nanny steps forward, gathering the children. They leave,
text: passing Violet in the doorway, still in her hat.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I saw Tom looking very stern as I
text: came up the drive.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I hope he's not building a bomb.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: Many a true word is spoken in jest.
dialog: We think he's being tailed by
dialog: Special Branch.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Nonsense. Mama, how was London?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: What were you there for?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh, various things.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But you hate London.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Whoever told you that? Now, when do
dialog: you want me tomorrow?
speaker_heading: CORA
text: Twelve at the latest. They arrive
dialog: at half past. But, Mama, you must
dialog: promise not to attack Maud Bagshaw.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I can't ignore her. She is my
dialog: cousin.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Exactly. Greet her as a cousin and
dialog: leave it at that.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'll think about it.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: But even if she has left everything
dialog: to an outsider, what could we do?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Challenge the will.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: On what basis?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Undue influence.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: But how could you know that? And
dialog: how would you prove it?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: We'd find a friendly judge.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Friendly or corrupt?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Whichever does the trick.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Are you here for dinner, Mama? It's
text: a buffet.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm not changed.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: We won't change either, so you just
dialog: need to take off your hat.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You talk as if that were easy.
text: Edith scoffs.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Where's the paper knife, the silver
dialog: one with my regimental crest?
text: At this, Mary looks over sharply.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DOWNTON. EVE.
dialog: 41.
text: Mrs Patmore is nearly mad. She turns a tap on as she speaks.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: They won't help tonight,
dialog: apparently. They won't lift a
dialog: finger. But then, my food is only
dialog: fit for servants. Well, at least
dialog: your young hero seems to have
text: sorted out the water.
text: Daisy laughs as she answers but they have not noticed Andy.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: He's not my hero.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yes. Why did you call him that?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: It was just a joke.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: But why's it funny?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Oh, Andy, leave it.
text: He storms off. Mrs Patmore looks at Daisy but she is unmoved.
scene_heading: EXT. KITCHEN COURTYARD. DOWNTON. EVE.
text: Andy comes out, fuming. He crosses the courtyard.
scene_heading: INT. BOILER ROOM. DOWNTON. EVE.
text: Andy looks at the boiler. He picks up a shovel leaning
text: against it and smashes part of the boiler until steam
text: escapes. He drops the shovel.
scene_heading: INT. MANSERVANTS’ BEDROOM CORRIDOR. EVE.
text: There’s trouble here too. Thomas watches from a doorway.
speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: But this is a rabbit hutch.
speaker_heading: ROYAL FOOTMAN
dialog: Don't look at me, Mr Courbet. You
dialog: couldn't swing a cat in my room.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Gentlemen, please. I'm sure you'll
dialog: find-
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: Out of my way! I will have a bath
dialog: and then I will decide. Perhaps I
dialog: will find a hotel.
text: He has walked into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: ROYAL FOOTMAN
dialog: Where can we eat? Somewhere apart?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Why not in the servants' hall?
speaker_heading: ROYAL FOOTMAN
dialog: We never eat with the resident
dialog: staff.
speaker_heading: COURBET (V.O.)
dialog: The water's cold. What's happening?
text: He reappears in the bathroom doorway.
speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: This is impossible. We can't stay
dialog: here with no hot water. Are you
dialog: crazy?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: But the boiler was fixed today. It
dialog: was hot an hour ago.
speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: Well, it's cold now!
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Why are you here again, Mr Carson?
dialog: So you could keep control when I
dialog: would fail? Was that it? I forget.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Mr Barrow, would you mind?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I'm not on duty, Mr Carson, you
dialog: are.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Downton in a torrent of rain.
scene_heading: INT. BUTLER’S PANTRY. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Carson enters to find Wilson working at his own desk. Wilson
text: decants a bottle of wine.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Since you are in my room, sitting
dialog: at my desk, it is for me to ask
dialog: what you want.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Nothing from you.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I would remind you that I have been
dialog: in charge of Downton for many
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Mr Carson, you are a retired
dialog: servant in a minor provincial
text: house, serving an undistinguished
dialog: family.
text: This is like a physical blow for Carson.
speaker_heading: WILSON (CONT’D)
dialog: Your history is of no interest to
dialog: me. Now, if you will excuse me.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: So, what would you like me to do?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I would like you to find a good
dialog: book and read it until we leave.
text: Anna appears at the door.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Mr Carson, you'd better come and
dialog: see this.
text: She goes and Carson follows, bruised.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN PASSAGE. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Sellick is with Mrs Patmore and Daisy. Andy sees them from
dialog: the passage.
speaker_heading: SELLICK
dialog: It's well and truly damaged.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Can you mend it in time?
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: SELLICK
dialog: Oh, yes. But somebody should tell
dialog: them someone wanted to wreck the
dialog: Royal visit. They ought to know.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: They help themselves from a buffet laid on the sideboard, and
text: then sit at the table. Cora turns to Edith as Carson enters.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Has the dress arrived?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Not yet. What am I going to wear?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Carson, what is it?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Some folding chairs-- Well, a great
dialog: many chairs have been delivered,
dialog: m'lady. They're at the back door.
dialog: Anna thought you should be told at
dialog: once.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: She's right. They're for the
dialog: parade. We'll have to set them out
dialog: tonight, there'll be no time
dialog: tomorrow. The villagers will start
text: arriving from nine onwards.
text: She hurries away.
speaker_heading: MERTON
dialog: I'm not sure fate is on our side.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Poor little Mary. Have we let her
dialog: take on too much?
speaker_heading: MERTON
dialog: You're right. Come on. We should
dialog: lend her a hand.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: You can't go out in this.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Of course we can. Good night, Mama.
dialog: Remember to pray for us, mainly for
dialog: better weather.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'll put in a word.
dialog: 46.
text: He hurries away with Merton.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: Of course, little Mary could hammer
text: in a tent peg with her teeth.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: I wonder who she got that from.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You know, I'm always surprised when
dialog: you praise me.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: I'm surprised to hear that I have.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN PASSAGE. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Outside the kitchen Mary’s with Anna, in the passage. We can
text: hear the heavy rain.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: As if things aren't bad enough
text: without a thunderstorm.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: We'll manage. I've roped in Mr
dialog: Molesley, and Andy's gone for the
dialog: truck. But Mr Bates can't help and
text: Mr Barrow has vanished.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Ditto. Lord Hexham's out looking
dialog: for Mr Branson. We'll have to do
dialog: our best without them.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You're not going yourself?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: How else will they know what to do?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Then I'll fetch our coats.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You don't have to come.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Of course I do. I'll just tell Mr
dialog: Bates where I've gone.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You're a good friend to me, Anna.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I hope we're good friends to each
dialog: other, m'lady.
text: She hurries off. For once, Mary is quite moved by this.
scene_heading: EXT. KITCHEN COURTYARD. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Andy and Molesley are loading the chairs into a truck with
text: Mary and Anna, when Robert and Merton come hurrying up.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Here we are. All set and ready.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh, Papa, Dickie, you're so kind.
dialog: But are you sure? You'll be soaked
text: to the skin and filthy.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: What's that to us? We're hunting
dialog: men. Come on.
speaker_heading: MERTON
dialog: You don't need to come, my dear. We
dialog: can manage it between us.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Of course I'm coming. Come along.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Cheer up, Molesley.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. KING’S ARMS. DOWNTON VILLAGE. NIGHT.
text: Through the pub window, in the rain, Branson and Chetwode are
text: talking over their pints of beer.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: The villagers and guests will watch
text: from both sides of the dais. And
dialog: there'll be seats at the front kept
dialog: for the family.
text: They sit near the fire.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: I'll join you there.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I suppose so.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: We'll meet in the high street where
dialog: we planned. Don't bring anyone.
dialog: Come on your own.
dialog: 48.
text: He smiles.
dialog: Naturally,
speaker_heading: CHETWODE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's all ridiculous, of course.
text: It's a lot of fuss over nothing.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: What? I thought you were here to
dialog: check I didn't do anything foolish
dialog: and spoil things.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: In what way?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I don't know. Throw eggs or wave a
dialog: banner or shout.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: Will you?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: No. But I'm starting to wonder
dialog: about you.
text: he’s joking, but Chetwode returns his stare.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: I don't throw eggs. Have another?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Yes.
text: He stands to buy the drinks, leaving Branson with an opaque
text: expression that is hard to read.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: Same again, please.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE GREEN. NIGHT.
text: In lashing rain, Molesley, Andy, Robert, Merton, Mary and
text: Anna carry folded seats towards the dais. Mary counts.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: We'll bring a special chair up for
dialog: the Queen after breakfast when,
dialog: hopefully, it will have stopped
text: raining.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: I shall carry it myself, m'lord!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What about the King?
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: MERTON
dialog: He'll be on his horse.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: But suppose it's still raining?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: God will make it stop.
text: Across the green, Branson is leaving the pub.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Is that Tom? Has he been in the pub
dialog: the whole evening? Huh.
text: Mary stares at Branson.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON. DAY
text: Downton on a beautiful, sunny day.
text: Mary stands near Carson. The servants stand in a line.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well, the day has dawned and the
text: weather proves conclusively that
dialog: God is a Monarchist.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Who could doubt it, m'lady?
text: Robert comes out with Bertie, Branson, Edith, Violet and the
text: Mertons, the men all in tweeds.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Here they come now.
text: She’s right. The two gleaming cars are progressing up the
text: drive. The first car stops beside them. The doors are held
text: open and King George V and Queen Mary get out. Molesley
text: starts to hyper-ventilate.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Mr Molesley?
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: I'm all right. I just need a moment
dialog: to catch my breath.
text: Cora plunges into a deep court curtsey before the King and
dialog: Queen.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Your Majesties, welcome to Downton
dialog: Abbey.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: We're glad to be here, Lady
dialog: Grantham. Grantham.
text: Robert gives a sharp neck bow. Cora takes over.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: You remember Lord Grantham's
dialog: mother.
text: Violet curtsies deeply. The King gives her his hand.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: Hello, Lady Grantham. Can I help
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Someone must, sir, or I may never
dialog: rise again. Thank you.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: My daughter, Lady Mary Talbot, The
dialog: Marquess and Marchioness of Hexham,
dialog: Mr Tom Branson.
text: Branson gives a very slight neck bow. Mary sighs with relief.
text: She looks at Bertie.
speaker_heading: CORA (CONT’D)
dialog: Lord and Lady Merton.
text: The Queen is being led down the same line by Robert.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: This is kind of you, Lord Grantham.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Not at all. It is a great honour.
dialog: I'm sure you know, but Princess
dialog: Mary and Lord Lascelles will be
dialog: joining us for luncheon and the
dialog: parade.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: They're both coming?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: As far as I'm aware.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: What a relief. Please forget I said
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Said what, ma'am?
dialog: 51.
text: She squeezes his arm. The others have curtsied and bowed. Now
text: Robert gestures to the servants. Behind them walks
text: Bagshaw. She and Violet will be equally matched.
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Cousin Maud.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Violet.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Are we going to kiss?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I'm glad you want to kiss me. It
dialog: wasn't quite what you said when I
dialog: last heard from you.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It wasn't quite how I felt when I
dialog: wrote.
scene_heading: EXT. KITCHEN COURTYARD. DOWNTON. DAY.
dialog: Lady
text: Branson is loitering outside when he sees a young woman
text: arrive, struggling with two cases. He walks towards her.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Can I help you at all?
speaker_heading: LUCY
text: Thanks. The others all shot off,
dialog: and I'm not sure if this is the
dialog: right way.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: If you just come with me. What's
dialog: your part in this circus?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I'm Lady Bagshaw's maid.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Oh well, then it's this door. If
dialog: you just ask for Mrs Hughes. She'll
dialog: look after you.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Thank you.
text: They have reached the back door. He watches her go
dialog: in.
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN PASSAGE. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Lucy walks past the others as Albert gives a bandbox to Anna.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: This has just arrived for Lady
dialog: Edith.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Lady Hexham these days, Mr Bates.
dialog: But-- Thank you, Albert. It's a
dialog: relief.
text: She starts up the servants’ staircase.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Courbet is in his chef’s toque and screaming at his minions.
speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: I want the milk now! I want the egg
dialog: yolks now! I want the olive oil
dialog: now! And I want the vanilla pod
dialog: now!
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: He wants a clip round the ear now.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Careful, Mrs Patmore. Right. Who's
dialog: taking this up? Mr Molesley?
text: Molesley, in day livery, lifts the serving plate as Anna
text: enters with Bates. Wilson pushes forward.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: There's no need for you to meddle,
dialog: Mrs Hughes. We will see to it.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Meddle? I don't believe I'm
dialog: meddling in my own house, thank
dialog: you. Andrew, yes. You take that
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: But it's not your house, is it? So
dialog: would you like to go and sit down?
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Now, just a minute.
text: He is infuriated by what he is witnessing. Molesley has
text: carried his plate out of the room. So has Andy.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: You! Leave those! Put them down.
dialog: For heaven's sake, go after them!
text: Two Royal footmen race out. Carson has seen the end of this.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I really must protest. My staff are-
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Keep them down here, Mr Carson.
dialog: That goes for you too. Stay out of
dialog: our way! You've seen Their
dialog: Majesties. Let it be enough.
text: Wilson has gone, leaving them all dumb struck.
scene_heading: INT. SERVERY. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Andy and Molesley prepare their plates, but the Royal footmen
text: snatch the dishes out of their hands.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: Wait a minute. What are you playing
dialog: at?
text: The footmen carry the plates out of the servery. Andy scoffs.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. DOWNTON. DAY.

text: Cora on his right.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
text: Things seem calmer in the north.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: You mean after the strike, sir?
dialog: Yes, if calmer means more resigned.
dialog: I'm not sure what the future holds.
text: The King looks towards Violet.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: And you, Lady Grantham? Were you
dialog: affected by the general strike?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: My maid was rather curt with me
dialog: while it was on, Sir. But she is a
dialog: communist at heart so I suppose it
dialog: was only to be expected.
dialog: 54.
text: Robert is sitting on the Queen’s right.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: Wasn't the Princess joining us?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: They telephoned. Lord Lascelles has
text: been held up by something. But they
dialog: are planning to come for the
dialog: parade.
text: The Queen raises her eyebrows slightly. Down the table Maud
text: Bagshaw is on Branson's left. Edith on Branson’s right.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I imagine the servants' bedrooms
dialog: are quite pleasant here.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Why? Are you worried for your maid?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: How clever of you. Lucy is more of
dialog: a companion than a maid. I'd hate
dialog: for her to be uncomfortable.
text: Branson is getting restless.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Of course.
text: He turns to Edith.
speaker_heading: BRANSON (CONT'D)
dialog: I really have to go.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: You can't embarrass Mama. I'm
dialog: sorry, but you must wait until we
dialog: stand.
text: Branson snatches up the menu holder, reads it and groans.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: Lord Hexham, how is Northumberland?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: As beautiful as ever, sir.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: Can it spare you, do you think?
text: Edith glances at her husband.
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN PASSAGE/SERVANTS’ HALL. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Molesley and Andy hurry down the stairs and head into the
text: hall. Mrs Patmore, Carson, Bates, Anna, Mrs Hughes and Daisy
text: are in a huddle.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: We might as well all go for a walk.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: We cannot challenge the way a Royal
dialog: visit is conducted, Mrs Patmore.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: I'm not so sure.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why don't we all meet back here
dialog: after the parade?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Anna, Mr Bates, there must be no
dialog: trouble or disloyal tomfoolery of
dialog: any kind. Do you hear me?
text: He strides away. The others share the moment.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: We'll meet in the wine cellar. Tell
dialog: the others. Now, I'm walking to Mr
dialog: Bakewell's, if you've any errands.
text: Mrs Patmore shakes her head.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM/HALL. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Luncheon is over. The equerry catches the King’s eye.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: We should get moving.
text: He stands and they all rise to their feet. He leads the way
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: What was the King saying earlier? I
dialog: couldn't hear.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: He's planning a tour for the Prince
dialog: of Wales next March. It'll take in
dialog: most of the African colonies and
dialog: finish in Cape Town.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: And he wants you to go?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: He thinks I'm a steadying

speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: How long would you be away?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: About three months. I can't believe
dialog: my luck. Can you?

text: In the hall, Branson hurries off, watched by Mary.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE. MAIN STREET. DAY.
text: The mounted squadron moves forward, down the main street,
text: towards the green. As they pass they reveal Branson
text: approaching the pub. He does not see Mary following him.
scene_heading: INT. A ROOM AT THE KING’S ARMS. DOWNTON VILLAGE. DAY.
text: Chetwode takes a revolver out of a drawer. He checks that
text: it’s loaded and puts it in his inside coat pocket.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE. MAIN STREET. DAY.
text: Chetwode comes out of the pub. Branson is walking towards him
text: as Mary arrives.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Tom!
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: What on earth are you doing here?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I might ask you the same question.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Go back or you'll ruin things.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Isn't that what you're doing?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: You don't know what I'm doing.
text: Chetwode has walked over to them so Branson cannot explain.
text: The crowd continues to cheer as the troops pass.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: Who's this?
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: This is my sister-in-law, Lady Mary
dialog: Talbot.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: I told you to come alone.
text: With a glance at Mary, he hurries away.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Leave this to me.
text: He runs off. Mary follows him.
text: Chetwode disappears into the crowd, turns and runs across the
text: street between mounted horses and gun carriages. Branson is
text: in pursuit, but he cannot cross as the street is now filled
text: with cavalry. Chetwode ducks into a side alley and then into
text: an empty barn. Branson dodges the horses and gives chase,
text: followed by Mary.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE. BARN & COURTYARD. DAY
text: Chetwode emerges from the barn to see the King on horseback,
text: with his equerry in front of him. They are walking slowly
text: towards the parade and don’t see Chetwode emerge. He lifts
text: his gun to take aim, when Branson slams him to the ground and
text: as they struggle.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Tom!
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Get the gun!
text: Mary steps on the wrist with the gun, forcing Chetwode to let
text: go. She kicks the gun away. Two plain clothed officers arrive
text: at the run and pull Chetwode up, leading him away. Branson
text: gets up.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE. DAY.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Are you all right, sir? Your
dialog: Ladyship?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Why are you even here? I didn't
dialog: suspect him myself until last
dialog: night.
text: Branson shakes his head. So does Mary. As Chetwode is cuffed
text: his anger takes over.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: How was I to know you'd given up on
dialog: a free Ireland?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Isn’t it free now?
speaker_heading: CHETWODE
dialog: Not with the bloody Crown around
dialog: its neck!
text: They watch him bundled into a police car.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I'm not impressed you all decided I
dialog: was a Royal assassin.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I didn't. It was really the others.
text: Branson’s expression rather questions this.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: If you'll follow us to the station.
text: They nod and set off after the police van.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Why didn't you tell us?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I thought he'd come to check up on
dialog: me and didn't want to drag you into
dialog: it. I assumed he'd back off if I
dialog: answered his questions and met him
dialog: for a drink. But last night at the
dialog: pub, I realised he wanted to use me
dialog: to get close to the King.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE GREEN. DAY.
text: Everyone stands as the King rides on to the parade ground,
text: attended by his equerry and other mounted officers.
text: The national anthem strikes up.
text: Anna creeps up to Mrs Patmore and Daisy. Bates is there. Anna
text: nods at him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Sorry. Excuse me.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: We thought you'd miss it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I was just in time.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I don't know why I bothered.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Shh!
text: The commanding officer rides up to the King, salutes with his
dialog: sword and asks:
speaker_heading: COMMANDING OFFICER
dialog: Your Majesty, The Yorkshire Hussars
dialog: are formed up, ready and awaiting
dialog: your inspection.
text: Escorted by the commanding officer, the King rides to the
text: right of the line, accompanied by the escorting officers. The
text: band plays as the inspection begins. The Queen has noticed an
text: empty chair next to her daughter.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
text: He's not feeling well.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: Wasn't he out shooting yesterday?
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: What do you want me to say?
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: You have to let me leave him.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: We will not talk about it now.
text: Cora turns to the Princess. Further down, Maud waves at Lucy
text: in the crowd.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Is that your maid?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: That’s right. Lucy.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Don't you call her by her surname?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: She's been with me so long.
text: This troubles Violet which Edith registers. In the background
text: the magnificent parade is still in full swing.
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: EXT. THE VILLAGE POLICE STATION. DAY.
text: Mary and Branson come out and start walking up the street.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's so strange. He seemed so
dialog: English.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: And so he was. A pillar of the
dialog: establishment until the notion of
dialog: Irish independence took him over to
dialog: the other side. That's where I came
dialog: in. He'd heard my sympathies lay
dialog: with Ireland and the republic.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don't they?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Not at any cost. I'm a law-and-
dialog: order man these days. That's what
dialog: you lot have done to me.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So will there be a great splash all
dialog: over the newspapers? Poor Papa.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Oh, no. You'll find there isn't a
dialog: whisper about this anywhere.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: An establishment cover-up. I don't
dialog: believe in conspiracy theories.
text: But he just smiles and they walk on.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTON VILLAGE GREEN. DAY.
text: The crowd disperses. Lucy Smith is also leaving. Branson
text: quickens his pace. Edith, with Bertie and others, notices.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Ah, Miss Smith. Did Mrs Hughes sort
dialog: you out?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: She did.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: And have you enjoyed the parade?
text: They laugh. She gives him a glance but he smiles and so does
dialog: she.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Do you work at the house?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Not exactly. I sell cars and I help
dialog: with the estate. Lord Grantham is
dialog: my father-in-law.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh, I do beg your pardon, sir.
text: She starts to drop back but he slows for her to join him.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: No, please, let me explain. I
dialog: started here as the chauffeur.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You must be Lady Sybil's husband.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Lady Bagshaw and I followed the
dialog: story. We were so sad when she
dialog: died. How long ago was it?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Seven years, or nearly. My God.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I'm sorry. It's still painful.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Not in that way. It doesn't hurt
text: anymore, but it's still there.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Was it hard, coming up like that?
dialog: Joining the family.
text: He looks at her. Then he decides to answer her question.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Very hard. Between my old world and
dialog: the new one, sometimes I didn't
dialog: know who I was.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: But you do now?
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I think so, yes. I came to terms
dialog: with it. Why?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I'm just curious.
text: Once again, Edith is watching them.
scene_heading: INT. THE WINE CELLAR. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: The Downton servants are in the wine cellar. Anna is ushering
text: them along. Baxter and Barrow are the last to enter.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Can somebody tell me what's going
dialog: on? Anna?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Shh!
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: What are we all doing down here?
text: Bates locks the door and turns to face the others.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: This is most improper.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Yes, why have you got us all here?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I will tell you. Mr Bates and I, we
dialog: want to defend Downton's honour.
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: In what way?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Would you like a repeat of how you
dialog: were all treated at luncheon?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: No, I bloody well would not.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Andrew! There are ladies present.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: We think we should fight back.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I don't like the sound of this. I
dialog: do not like this at all.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Anna, tell them.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: We are going to clear the way so
dialog: you cook and serve dinner for the
dialog: King and Queen at Downton Abbey. As
dialog: you should.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Oh, my God! Is this a revolution?
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: Shall I fetch the pitchforks?
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: We're serious, Mr Molesley.
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: But do you know what Mr Courbet has
dialog: brought in for tonight?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Never mind that. We've got our own
dialog: supplies.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And you can leave Mr Courbet to me.
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: What do you want us to do?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Don't bother with the maids and
dialog: valets. We've no quarrel with them.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: But we need to get rid of the Royal
dialog: butler for the night.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: The Page of the Backstairs, if you
dialog: don't mind, Mr Bates.
text: He is loving it. Bates is more serious.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: And the footmen need to be out of
dialog: commission from seven until you
dialog: finish serving.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: This is treason!
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What can we do about them?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: We could lock them in the attic.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Any more talk like that and we'll
dialog: all end up in Botany Bay.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: And did you enjoy being pushed
dialog: around and passed over and told to
dialog: stay down here by Mr Wilson?
text: She has been silent until now. Carson is caught. In agony.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I will play no active part in this.
dialog: Suppose His Majesty sees what's
dialog: going on and is displeased?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Why? Do you think I'm not capable
dialog: of cooking a decent dinner?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Oh, no, of course not. But I-
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I'll see to the footmen.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You'll find out.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: So, does this mean we're back on
dialog: duty after all? Me and Mr Molesley?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And Albert as well. You know where
dialog: to find the state liveries.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: Will I pour wine for the Queen's
dialog: sweet lips?
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Any more of that and we'll lock you
text: in the attic.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I don't know why you're bothering.
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: What about that Mrs Webb who keeps
dialog: telling us she's the housekeeper?
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Don't you worry about Mrs Webb. I
dialog: am more than a match for Mrs Webb.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN PASSAGE. DAY.
text: By the cellar door, they are dispersing.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I still don't know how you're going
dialog: to manage Mr Courbet.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well, there’s--
text: At that moment Courbet appears, yawning.
speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: I'm just going upstairs to lie
dialog: down. Can you get things ready for
dialog: when I come back?
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: And when will that be, Oh Mighty
dialog: One?
text: He does not like her tone, but he decides not to quarrel.
speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: Wake me in half an hour if I'm not
text: already in the kitchen.
text: But he is stifled by his yawns as he sets off for the stairs.
text: They are all amazed. The others stare at Anna. Bates smiles.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Trust us.
scene_heading: INT. HALL. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: The King and Queen, the family, Maud Bagshaw and the Mertons
text: are having tea. Other guests, who came to watch the parade,
text: have joined them. They are served by the four Royal footmen.
text: Mary is with Violet, Maud, Merton and Isobel.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Tell us about your maid.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Lucy is the daughter of David's
dialog: army servant, Jack Smith. And, like
dialog: my husband, he died in the Boer
dialog: Wars.
speaker_heading: MERTON
dialog: So you looked after his child?
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Lucy had no mother, you see. So I
dialog: gave her a home.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: That's very generous.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Generosity that has been amply
dialog: returned, I can assure you.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I’m glad.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You don't sound very glad.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDENS. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Branson, now in a morning coat, is watching Sybbie and the
text: others play. Nanny waits nearby. There is movement in the
text: shadows and Branson investigates. Princess Mary is crying.
text: She sits on a bench. Branson clears his throat to announce
dialog: his presence.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: Goodness. I thought everyone was in
text: the drawing room.
text: She looks at him and wipes her eyes briskly.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I've been dodging it, I'm afraid. I
dialog: suppose I ought to get back. Can I
dialog: get someone for you?
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: No. Thank you. You're the widower
dialog: of the youngest daughter, aren't
dialog: you? I've heard of you, Mr...
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Branson. Tom Branson. And who are
dialog: you? I should know, but I'm no good
dialog: at that sort of thing.
text: After a puzzled moment, this pleases her.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: I suppose you can't be expected to
dialog: know everyone. Did you enjoy the
dialog: parade?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I'm afraid I missed it completely.
dialog: I got distracted.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: What a shame.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Well, to be honest, I'm not much of
dialog: a Royalist. Although, I probably
dialog: shouldn't say that out loud.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: Certainly not to a stranger. That
dialog: seems odd as the Crawleys would die
dialog: for the Crown if they had to.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: You can love people you disagree
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: And you love them?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: They're decent at the core.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: People can be decent at the core
dialog: but very difficult to live with.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: True enough. They're silly too and
dialog: snobbish at times. And I wouldn't
dialog: give tuppence for their politics.
dialog: But I've learned to be happy with
dialog: all of that. And, besides, they're
dialog: my daughter's family.
text: She looks over to where the children are playing.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: And she lives here?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I nearly took her away once. She
dialog: belongs here now. I spent so much
dialog: of my life not belonging anywhere.
dialog: That's important to me.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: I suppose, in the end, it's
dialog: deciding what's important, isn't
dialog: it? You've given me a great deal to
dialog: think about, Mr Branson.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Good things, I hope.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: That may be so, but now we must go
dialog: in.
dialog: 68.
text: They get up.
scene_heading: INT. HALL. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Violet is now with Maud and Isobel.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: We must change. And you leave in
dialog: the morning. I wonder if we might
dialog: have a talk later? We'll finda
dialog: cosy spot. And Robert can join us.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I won't be interrogated, Violet.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: Please, don't miss the chance to
dialog: settle things between you.
text: She glances at Violet. Maud looks at them both for a moment.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Very well. But now I must go.
text: She joins the Queen and Their Majesties lead the way out.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That was helpful. Thank you.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: I told you I wanted to help.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Well, thanks to you, we have her
text: cornered.
text: She leaves. Isobel is not entirely sure she is pleased.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN PASSAGE. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Wilson is walking past. Bates and Baxter are waiting.
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: Mr Wilson, there's a telephone call
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: For me?
scene_heading: INT. BUTLER’S PANTRY. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Wilson, talking on the telephone, is bewildered.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: But, Sir Harry, they wouldn't get
dialog: to London until nine.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (OVER TELEPHONE)
text: It doesn't matter. The ball at
dialog: Clarence House won't start ‘til
dialog: ten.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: What ball at Clarence House?
speaker_heading: ELLIS (OVER TELEPHONE)
dialog: The Duke of Connaught's. What are
dialog: you playing at, Wilson?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I'm not questioning you, sir. Not
dialog: if it's what the Duke of Connaught
dialog: wishes. But how do I manage here?
speaker_heading: ELLIS (OVER TELEPHONE)
dialog: Don't they have footmen at Downton?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yes. There are footmen. But won't
dialog: His Majesty--
speaker_heading: ELLIS (OVER TELEPHONE)
dialog: His Majesty won't give a tinker's
dialog: cuss. Now do as I say!
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Of course, Sir Harry, at once.
text: He puts down the receiver.
scene_heading: INT. POST OFFICE. DOWNTON VILLAGE. DAY
text: Ellis hangs up the telephone. He and Thomas stifle laughs.
scene_heading: INT. BUTLER’S PANTRY. DOWNTON. DAY
text: Bates and Baxter are watching.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Everything all right, Mr Wilson?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I need to see my footmen, and the
text: house footmen and the hall boy.
dialog: When is the next train to London?
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: I hope it's not bad news.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Not bad, exactly, but irregular.
dialog: Very irregular indeed.
scene_heading: EXT. POST OFFICE. DOWNTON VILLAGE. DAY.
text: Thomas and Ellis leave the post office. They are in stitches.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'll get drummed out of the
dialog: regiment if they ever find out.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You sounded convincing to me.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'm very good at doing Sir Harry
dialog: Barnston, I can assure you.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What if Mr Wilson rings back?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
text: No one queries Sir Harry's orders.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: But if he did?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Then they'd uncover the trick. But
dialog: they couldn't trace it back to me.
dialog: Right. Shall we go into York?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I'm sorry to miss out on the fun in
dialog: a way. Where shall I wait for you
dialog: when you're with your parents?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We'll find a pub.
scene_heading: INT. EDITH’S BEDROOM. DOWNTON. DAY.
text: Edith is wearing her new ball dress. It is huge. Prettily
text: embroidered but huge. Anna comes in.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Did you manage to speak to someone?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I got hold of Madame Seymour's
dialog: assistant. They've sent you the
dialog: wrong one. It's similar in style,
dialog: but not, as you can see, in size.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Where's my dress now?
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: On its way to New York.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Well, that's that, then. Wonderful.
dialog: Everything's going wrong for me
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: M’ lady?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Never mind. How are things
dialog: downstairs? Any better?
text: Anna helps Edith out of the dress and into a dressing gown.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: A bit better. Yes, m'lady. In fact,
dialog: I ought to be getting back.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Of course. One thing. The painted
dialog: glass that used to sit by my bed,
dialog: was it broken while I was away?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Leave it with me, m'lady, and the
dialog: dress. You wouldn't mind a fitting
dialog: later tonight, would you?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: I don't understand. Who with?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I’ve just had an idea.
scene_heading: INT. MAUD BAGSHAW’S BEDROOM. DOWNTON. EVE.
text: Violet opens the door. Maud sits at the dressing table. Her
text: maid, Lucy, stands beside her. Both are chuckling.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I shouldn't think so, not if she
dialog: knows what's good for her.
text: They peal with laughter again. Now Violet speaks.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I'm sorry to interrupt.
text: Maud swings round, her eyes narrow.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: How clever of you to find me.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Not really. I lived here forty
dialog: years. I assume this is your maid.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Yes. This is Lucy Smith.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh, good evening, Smith.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Good evening, m'lady. Shall I go?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Not for me. Not for me. I'm
dialog: delighted to meet you. I've heard
dialog: so much about you.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Is there something you want?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Just to see you're comfortable, and
dialog: to confirm our little chat for
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I live my own life now, Violet. I'm
dialog: not what I was. My father is gone.
dialog: My husband is gone. I see no reason
dialog: not to do what I want.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That doesn't mean there is no
dialog: reason, merely that you cannot see
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I think Lady Merton is right. We'll
dialog: have it out, once and for all. But
dialog: now I must go to Her Majesty.
text: She puts on her gloves and leaves. Violet stares at Lucy.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Hmm.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DOWNTON. EVE.

speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: You're not to speak. You're not to

dialog: Do you hear me? I don't want them
dialog: to even notice.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: We will do our best, Mr Wilson.
speaker_heading: WILSON

speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Is everything under control here,

dialog: caught the train.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: And this is what we're left with.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Mind you don't disgrace the state

scene_heading: ALBERT THE HALL BOY
dialog: Of course, Mr Carson.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Where is Monsieur Courbet? I came
dialog: in here to see him.
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: He went out. So I thought I'd

dialog: right?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: No. You were not right. You were
dialog: entirely WRONG!
speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE
dialog: Oh!

speaker_heading: MRS PATMORE (CONT’D)

dialog: If you don't want me to, I won't.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: But you've already said that you
dialog: will.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Because it's a fantastic chance. It
dialog: didn't occur to me you'd mind.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: I don't exactly, not in that way.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Then in what way?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: I wasn't going to tell you. I
dialog: wasn't going to tell anyone. But...
text: He waits for her explanation.
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: I might be pregnant.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Oh, darling. How marvellous. How
dialog: fabulous. My heart is bursting.
text: They embrace.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Well, that's exactly what I don't
dialog: want. It could easily go wrong.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: But, if it doesn't-
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Then I'll give birth just as you
dialog: set off on your three-month
dialog: colonial tour.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Why didn't you say this when I
dialog: first mentioned it?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: You'd agreed before I had the
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Secrets always muddle things.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Oh, yes. That's right. Let's make
dialog: it my fault.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Well, I'll tell the King I can't
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: And he'll accept that, will he?

speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Hello. It's Miss Smith, isn't it?
dialog: We were talking about you earlier.
dialog: Weren't we?

speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Tom. What luck! You know Miss

text: She hurries away with a bewildered Mary.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Are you all right? Has something
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Old Lady Grantham came in while we
dialog: were dressing. I think the stage is
dialog: set for a fight later, about me.
dialog: She thinks Lady Bagshaw means to
dialog: favour me and she doesn't approve.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: What business is it of hers? Lady
dialog: Bagshaw must have her reasons. And
dialog: that's good enough for me.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Going down, Tom?
text: He has emerged from his dressing room. The two men walk off.
speaker_heading: BRANSON

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: There you are, Miss Lawton. I hope

speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: There's always less for me to do
dialog: when Miss Aplin arrives. But we
dialog: must be ready for the ball
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That's what I want to talk about.
dialog: Later this evening, when I go up to
dialog: help Lady Hexham, I want you to
dialog: come with me, fit a new ball dress
dialog: and sew it overnight so it's done
dialog: before you leave in the morning.
text: Miss Lawton stares at her.
speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: Why on earth would I do that?
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: The box and cupid from the drawing
dialog: room, the library paper knife, Lady
dialog: Hexham's painted glass?
text: The penny drops painfully.
speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: I never took the glass.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Then it must have been broken, like
dialog: she said. But you took something
dialog: from that room. What was it?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: LAWTON
text: A patch box from the dressing

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'd like them all back, please.
speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: I can't sew a dress in a night.
dialog: When would I sleep?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: When you get to Harewood tomorrow.
dialog: And don't think I won't tell.

scene_heading: INT. PUBLIC HOUSE. YORK. NIGHT.

speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: I'm going on to Turton's ina

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I'm waiting for someone.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: For a very long time. Perhaps he's

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Why don't you come with me? You

text: Thomas stares at him. He sups some beer and puts down the

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Excuse me, sir? My name's Barrow.
dialog: If someone comes looking for me,
dialog: could you tell him I've gone?
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: Shall I say where to?

speaker_heading: THOMAS WEBSTER

scene_heading: INT. SERVERY. DOWNTON. EVE.

speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I just cannot understand where Mr

dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Never mind him. What about you?
dialog: Surely you can't really mean to
dialog: leave His Majesty unattended.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: But is it for me to attend him?
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Well, you've got your breeches on.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I have, but-
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Mr Carson, this is your destiny.
dialog: You know as much, and so do I. Now
dialog: accept it proudly. And walk into
dialog: that room with your head held high.
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: You can do it, Mr Carson.
text: Carson pauses, thinks, nods and heads to the dining room. Mrs
text: Webb comes in. She is furious.
speaker_heading: MRS WEBB
dialog: Please tell me what is going on!
speaker_heading: BATES
dialog: Mr Courbet is missing, ditto Mr
dialog: Wilson, and your footmen are on
dialog: their way up to London.
speaker_heading: MRS WEBB
dialog: I am still in charge here.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: No, Mrs Webb. These are my people
dialog: now. So please, go back to the
dialog: servants' hall and sit down. Or
dialog: would you rather ruin the evening?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That's telling her.
text: Mrs Webb might protest but thinks better and retreats as Anna
text: and Baxter arrive, carrying sauce boats and bowls.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Mrs Patmore forgot to send up the
dialog: sauce.
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: And I've got the chopped egg.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: That's kind when it's not your job.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Nonsense. We must all pull our

speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Now, are you ready, boys?
scene_heading: ALBERT THE HALL BOY
dialog: Ready as we'll ever be.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: We'll be fine, Mrs Hughes.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: What about you, Mr Molesley?
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: I know I'm going to forget my

speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: You haven't got any lines!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You're on.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY

scene_heading: EXT. TURTON’S. YORK. NIGHT
text: Thomas and Webster approach a closed door. Webster knocks in

scene_heading: INT. TURTON’S. YORK. NIGHT.
text: Thomas enters the bar with Chris Webster. He looks round,
text: amazed. It is a covert gay club. Men are dancing with men.
speaker_heading: TURTON’S PATRON
dialog: Looks like we’ve got some new blood
dialog: here. Hello.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I can't believe this. I've never
dialog: seen anything like it.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: There's a first time for
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I know, but...
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Come dance with me.

scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. DOWNTON. NIGHT.

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: You were every bit as brave as I
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Mary, you're talking in the wrong
dialog: direction.
text: The other women have followed the Queen to face the other
text: way. Except Mary. She turns. Now Branson is talking to Edith.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Don't worry about Granny. She's
dialog: getting ready to give Cousin Maud a
dialog: grilling. Mainly, I suspect, about
dialog: her maid.
dialog: This isa
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I think Lady Bagshaw sees her as
text: more than just her maid.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: I'm sure she does. And that's what
dialog: Granny's afraid of.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I might as well admit... I like
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Good. Don't let them put you off.
text: surprise and Branson turns to look at her.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Tom, you're looking pleased with
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: He was just praising Lady Bagshaw's
dialog: maid.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: How did she contrive to make your
dialog: acquaintance?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: She didn't contrive anything. We
dialog: met by chance.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What simpletons men are.
text: The King speaks to Cora on his right.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: This is good. And I thought
dialog: something else was planned. But it
dialog: is excellent. So, a well done to
dialog: old Courbet.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: Oh, this wasn't Monsieur Courbet,
dialog: Your Majesty. Mrs Patmore cooked
dialog: it. In fact, it is the Downton
dialog: Abbey staff who are serving you
dialog: this evening.
text: This silences the room. Andy makes a horrified face at
text: Molesley who suddenly realises he’s broken every sacred law.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I do beg your pardon, Your Majesty.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: That's quite enough, Molesley.
text: Molesley is trembling with nerves and humiliation. He is
text: literally paralysed. The Queen decides to save the moment.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: You must give our compliments to
text: Mrs Patmore and to all the staff.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Molesley, Her Majesty is speaking
dialog: to you.
text: Molesley had been locked in a mist of dark, satanic horror
text: but now the sun breaks through. He opens, like a flower.
speaker_heading: MOLESLEY
dialog: With pleasure, Your Majesty
text: He plunges into a cross between a bow and a curtsey and
text: slowly backs out of the room.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: That was kind of you, ma'am.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: I suppose he's excited that they've
dialog: had to take over from our people. I
dialog: wonder what's happened.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Whatever may have happened does not
dialog: excuse his behaviour.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: I can assure you, Lady Grantham, we
dialog: are quite used to people behaving
dialog: strangely when we are near.
text: Which makes Cora laugh.
scene_heading: INT. TURTON’S. YORK. NIGHT.
text: Thomas is very drunk. He is also dancing the tango with
dialog: Webster. He has never had such a good time. Until the air is
text: rent with the sound of a loud whistle. The band stops. A
text: policeman in uniform is facing them.
scene_heading: EXT. TURTON’S. YORK. NIGHT
text: Black Marias are parked in the road. Policemen run towards
dialog: the club.
dialog: 84.
scene_heading: INT. TURTON'S. YORK. NIGHT
text: Policemen surround the men in the club.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: All right, gentlemen. That's the
dialog: end of your evening. Shut that
dialog: music up now! Right! You are all
dialog: coming to the station with us.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: We're just having a bit of fun,
dialog: Officer. No one's making any
dialog: trouble.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: That's for the judge to decide.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Judge?
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: What did you think? We were going
dialog: to slap your wrists and send you
dialog: home?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I've never been here before.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Well, you're here now. Right!
dialog: Gather your things. You're coming
dialog: with us, you dirty perverts.
scene_heading: EXT. TURTON’S. YORK. NIGHT.
text: The club is in a dark side street. The men are loaded in to
text: the Black Marias, Thomas among them. On the other side of the
text: road Ellis is watching from the car.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Supervised by Carson, Molesley and Andy dispense coffee and
text: drinks. Violet is with Isobel. She drops her voice.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I met the maid. She has Maud wound
text: around her little finger.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: Then we need to know why.
text: Bertie approaches the King, who turns to him, smiling.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: What is it, Hexham?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Well, Your Majesty, it's this. I've
dialog: just learned that Lady Hexham is
dialog: expecting our first child.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: But that's wonderful news.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: We're not telling anyone quite yet.
dialog: But I thought you'd be interested.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: And so I am. Congratulations.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The thing is, Sir, it's due to be
dialog: born around the time the Prince and
dialog: I will be setting off on tour.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: Excellent! Please make it register
dialog: with him. Help the Prince to
dialog: understand what it means to have a
dialog: real family life. You can be such
dialog: an example to him, I know it.
text: Bertie drops back, stumped. Maud, Violet, Cora, Robert and
text: Isobel are sitting together.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Very well. Let's get to the point.
dialog: Robert is my nearest relation on my
dialog: father's side.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: He is.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: But he will not be my heir.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: And there we have it.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Who will be? Can you tell us?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Lucy Smith, my maid.
text: This does not come as a surprise to Isobel. It does to Cora.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What? Are you out of your mind?
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: No. And I know what I'm doing.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: On the contrary, you're clearly
dialog: insane! You should be in an asylum!
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: How like you. A word of resistance
dialog: and you slash with your sabre.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It is lucky for Miss Smith that I
dialog: do not own a sabre.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: So this is truly your choice?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Lucy has taken care of me for many
dialog: years. I wish to show my gratitude.
text: She is very determined but Violet has boiled over.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: With the family house? With the
dialog: family estate? You belong in a
dialog: straitjacket! To treat your maid as
dialog: a blood relation is to unpick every
dialog: fibre of the English way of life.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: What piffle you talk.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Please, there is no need to argue.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I never argue. I explain.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Face it, Violet, I'll outlive you
dialog: anyway, so it need trouble you no
dialog: further. And now, I must attend Her
dialog: Majesty.
text: She stands and leaves. Robert has stood as she goes.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Game, set and match to Lady
dialog: Bagshaw.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Not while I'm the umpire.
text: Violet has lost her rag. Isobel has not.
dialog: 87.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION. YORK. NIGHT.
text: Ellis is talking to the sergeant.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We had a few drinks and Mr Barrow
dialog: thought it'd be fun to play a trick
dialog: on the queers, that's all. He was
text: only in there for five minutes.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
text: Dancing the tango with another man.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Come on, Sergeant. It was a joke.
text: But he sees he needs a new tactic.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Turns your stomach, though.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Relieved to hear it.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I'd rather be dead if I thought I
dialog: was one of them. But what can I say
dialog: to the earl?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: What earl?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: The Earl of Grantham. Mr Barrow is
dialog: his butler. Of course, you'll want
dialog: to see proof of my identity.
text: He hands over a card. The luckless copper stares at it in
dialog: horror.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION. YORK. NIGHT.
text: Thomas emerges, looking round. Ellis waves him over.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Was it you who got me out?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: No, the good fairy came down on a
dialog: moonbeam.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: How did you know where I'd gone?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: The landlord told me. I waited
dialog: outside, followed you here.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Then I showed the sergeant my card,
dialog: and that seemed to settle things.
text: He is still holding the card which Thomas takes.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: "The Royal Household." He must have
dialog: loved that. I'm afraid I've been a
dialog: silly boy.
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: You just need to be a bit more
dialog: circumspect in future, Mr Barrow.
text: He puts his finger to his lips and touches Thomas’. Thomas
text: slips the card into his pocket, which Ellis does not notice.
text: He has forgotten about the card completely.
scene_heading: INT. EDITH’S BEDROOM. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Edith is having the dress fitted by Lawton, watched by Anna.
speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: Could you please remove it, m'lady,
dialog: leaving the pins in place?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Can you really get it done before
dialog: you go? I don't see how.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: She'll finish it. Won't you?
speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: I'll do my best.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm sure you'll manage. By the way,
dialog: I think I know what happened to the
text: cupid from the drawing room,
dialog: m'lady.
text: Edith has stepped out of the dress. Now Lawton takes it.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Really? Was it missing?
speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: Your dress will be ready in the
dialog: morning, m'lady.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Thank you.
text: Lawton leaves.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know how you persuaded her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: She's nice, really. When you get to
dialog: know her. Is there anything else?
text: Bertie arrives in a dressing gown as Anna leaves.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Only to say that you're a genius.
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'm afraid I didn't get anywhere.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Well, that's that, just because the
dialog: King doesn't see that a man has any
dialog: part to play in childbearing.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Well, he doesn't. But you'd think
dialog: he'd know that one likes to be
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: You can't just tell him no?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Darling, I'm one of the senior
dialog: peers in the land. What do you
dialog: think that means? What do you think
dialog: I'm sworn to?
dialog: Edith has nothing to add.
scene_heading: INT. MAUD’S BEDROOM. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Maud comes in to find Isobel waiting.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: Lady Bagshaw, could I have a word
dialog: before you ring for your maid?
text: Maud, puzzled, nods.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL (CONT’D)
dialog: Does Lucy know that you're her
dialog: mother?
text: The bomb has dropped. Maud takes a deep breath.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: She does. For years I said I was
dialog: her godmother, but I told her the
dialog: truth on her eighteenth birthday.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: How old was she when Jack died?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Six. She'd lived with Jack and his
dialog: mother until then. But I took her
dialog: into the house and she went to the
dialog: village school until, eventually,
dialog: she became my maid.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: I suppose if she'd been your ward,
dialog: people would have guessed.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Exactly. Who takes notice of a
dialog: servant? I hid her in plain sight.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: Did you love Jack Smith?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Everyone should know a total love
dialog: at least once. Jack was mine. My
dialog: husband was very dull, you know? He
dialog: wasn't a bad man, but he wasn't a
dialog: clever one either. And... then he
dialog: died and Jack came to see me and it
dialog: began from there.
text: They sit near the fire.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: How daring.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I know it sounds reckless, but I
dialog: was thirty-nine when I got
dialog: pregnant. I thought I was barren.
dialog: Of course, I knew I couldn't tell
dialog: my father, so I went to America.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: They must have thought that wild.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Little did they know how wild it
dialog: really was.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: But you were happy with Jack?
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Very. We had ten years together
dialog: before he died. I'd have married
dialog: him if I'd had the courage. I was
dialog: weak. But you never knew my father.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: I suppose Royal service kept you
dialog: silent on the subject.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: In a way. But it was cowardice,
dialog: really. Now, by making Lucy my
dialog: heir, I will have taken the first
dialog: step.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: You must tell Violet at once.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I couldn't.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: You're wrong. As soon as she knows
dialog: the truth, she'll fathom your plans
dialog: and cease to fight you.
scene_heading: INT. MARY’S BEDROOM. DOWNTON. NIGHT.
text: Anna is looking after Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: The servants seemed to be enjoying

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It's a long story, m'lady. But
dialog: you're right. We did have fun.
text: Mary has tied her dressing gown and sits at a writing desk.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well, I'm glad it's gone well for
dialog: everyone. But I don't think I could
text: face doing it again.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You're not finished yet. You've

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes, but it won't be our fault if

speaker_heading: ANNA

dialog: think. Should we really go on with
dialog: it? We're running the house with
dialog: too few people as it is. And half
dialog: of those here now will leave soon.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What are you saying, m'lady?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Isn't it time to chuck in the
dialog: towel? Lots of people have.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You mean, leave Downton?
text: Mary moves to a chair beside the bed.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We could sell it for a school or an
dialog: old people's home or something. And
dialog: buy a manor house with a modest
dialog: estate, and live a normal life.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Is that what you want?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I want everything to stop being
dialog: such a struggle. Will the staff
dialog: stay? Will the farms pay? What are
dialog: we going to do about the roof? When
dialog: I was putting up the chairs in the
dialog: rain, I kept thinking, "What am I
dialog: doing?"
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'll tell you what you're doing,
dialog: m'lady. You're making a centre for
dialog: the people who work here, for this
dialog: village, for the county. Downton
dialog: Abbey is the heart of this
dialog: community. And you're keeping it
dialog: beating.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So you think we should battle on?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: While there's blood in your veins.

speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Ah, Miss Smith. Is she settled for
dialog: the night?
speaker_heading: LUCY
text: She's more rattled than settled.
dialog: And I was right. There was an
dialog: argument, and it was about me.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I hear from Lord Grantham she's
dialog: planning to alter your life for the
dialog: better. He says Old Lady Grantham
text: was up in arms.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I can imagine.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Are you entitled to your good luck?
dialog: Do you know why she's doing it?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I do. And I think it's fair.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Go forward in health and use your
dialog: luck wisely.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I have such a feeling that you can
dialog: understand what's going on inside
dialog: my head, when no one else does or
dialog: ever could. I'll miss our talks.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Would you like to write to me? I
dialog: could always provide a shoulder.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: May I? Really?
text: Branson holds Lucy’s hand.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: I should be pleased and flattered
dialog: if you would.
text: He leans in to kiss her. She responds but then pulls back.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: And now I think it's time to say
dialog: good night, Mr Branson.
dialog: She leaves

speaker_heading: BRANSON

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It was decent of her, Daisy, when

speaker_heading: EVERYONE

text: Daisy away from the others.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I've got to tell you something,
dialog: Daisy. It was me that broke the

dialog: doing. I was just in a jealous
dialog: rage.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It was that plumber you made eyes
dialog: at. I just saw red. And then when I
dialog: realised I'd brought him back to
dialog: the house, I went nearly mad.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I did not make eyes. I liked him,
dialog: but there was nothing more to it.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I feel a fool now.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You tried to wreck the visit of the
dialog: King of England. You risked being
dialog: sacked, you risked ruin, just for
dialog: the love of me?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: My feelings took over. That's all I
dialog: can say. Can you forgive me?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Forgive you? Oh, Andy, I'd have
dialog: done it myself if I'd had the
dialog: nerve. Don't you see what it means?
dialog: We're alike, you and I, full of
dialog: passion for what matters. I thought
dialog: you were easily satisfied, but I

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: We're talking now.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: And it feels good. Just to be two

speaker_heading: ELLIS

speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: Doesn't it ever worry you that on

dialog: ornament that you couldn't buy with
dialog: a year's wages?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And what's your answer? Because
dialog: everyone can't have them, no one
dialog: should have them?
speaker_heading: LAWTON
dialog: No. My answer is, "Why can't I have
dialog: them? Or some of them." Don't
dialog: worry. They won't miss what I take.
dialog: I doubt there's more than one in a
dialog: hundred will even notice they're
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: But they're not yours, Miss Lawton.
dialog: And they never will be. I'd give it
dialog: up, if I were you. What if people

dialog: We thought he'd gone out an' all.

speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES

speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: But who would do that?
speaker_heading: MRS WEBB
dialog: Who, indeed?
speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: We can investigate when we get to

speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I should be careful, Monsieur

speaker_heading: COURBET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I'd say the dinner was a success.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: They sent down their compliments,

speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: But what do we say if we're asked?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: There was a confusion in London.

speaker_heading: EDITH

speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: I just want to own my own life. I

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don't you now?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: No. I spend my time entertaining
dialog: people who bore me to death because
dialog: they're entitled to sit at our
dialog: table. I attend committees that I
dialog: haven't chosen because they've
dialog: chosen me. I used to have a job
dialog: that I loved, but not anymore. And

speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: Thanks.

speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not much, but I've had it for

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I hope you enjoy your time at

speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: Yes. I hope so too.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: It isn't really goodbye when we'll

speaker_heading: CORA

speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: Well, let's mount up , shall we?

speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT’D)
dialog: Well done, everyone! Shall we head
dialog: back in?
dialog: Carson, what happened to the Royal
dialog: servants last night?
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Hard to say, m'lord. They sort of
dialog: gave up the ghost.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Well, you managed splendidly.
dialog: Although, I could have done without
dialog: Molesley's aria. But please thank

speaker_heading: CARSON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: Are you very shocked by it all?
speaker_heading: CARSON

dialog: me part of it, to boot. I don't
dialog: know what came over me.
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES
dialog: But?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: They had it coming to them, Elsie.
dialog: Let's face it, they had it coming
dialog: in spades. Hello, what's this?

speaker_heading: CARSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Welcome back, Mr Talbot.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Hello, Carson, Mrs Hughes. Do you
dialog: know where I'll find Lady Mary?
speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES

speaker_heading: HENRY

speaker_heading: MRS HUGHES

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Never mind. You're here now. And I
dialog: don't have to go to the ball alone
text: like a sad little wallflower.
speaker_heading: HENRY

speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: If you continue in this vein, you

speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: What I say.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Are you keeping something from me?
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: Come with me.

speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: Why aren't you happy? I thought
dialog: you'd be delirious.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: We are happy, if you mean it. Very.
dialog: But how will you manage Henry?
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: By altering the way we manage each
dialog: other. And it may not be easy, but
dialog: I've decided that I'm staying with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: I just don't understand what
dialog: changed your mind.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: It was something Mr Branson said
dialog: about deciding what matters. For
dialog: me, the Crown matters more than any
dialog: of us. I can make it work.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: Branson? The Irish republican?
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: You're well informed.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: I'm better informed than you know.
dialog: So he persuaded you to do this?
speaker_heading: PRINCESS MARY
dialog: We were talking after the parade.
dialog: Oh, there he is. Say something
dialog: nice. Please.
dialog: 106.
text: The King walks through the crowd to where Branson’s standing,

speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: Mr Branson. I wish we had spoken
dialog: more while we were at Downton
dialog: Abbey.
text: Branson is completely bewildered.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Do you, sir?
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: Certainly. I believe I have more
dialog: than one reason to be grateful to
dialog: you. More than one.
text: He walks on. Branson, dazed, rejoins Henry and Mary.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What was that all about?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'll tell you when we're alone.
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: But why more than one?
text: He is amazed. Then he catches sight of the Princess.
speaker_heading: BRANSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Who is she?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That's Princess Mary. She was at
dialog: Downton for the parade yesterday.
dialog: Didn't you see her?
speaker_heading: BRANSON
dialog: Not at the parade. But I saw her
text: afterwards, at the tea.
text: The Princess nods to him. He gives a neck bow, with a smile.
text: Violet, Maud Bagshaw and Isobel sit together.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: So, you see, she has Brompton
dialog: blood, albeit from an unusual
dialog: angle.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Why did you not say this long ago?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: It seemed too great a leap for you.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Who do you think I am? Some maiden
dialog: aunt who's never left the village?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Obviously not.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Don't think I approve, because I
dialog: don't. But at least I understand.
dialog: Does Miss Smith know the truth?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Yes, she does. When I get home I
dialog: will hire another maid, and Lucy
dialog: can be my companion.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That's much more suitable.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: And I'm afraid you'll dislike it,
dialog: but she says that she and Tom
dialog: Branson have agreed to correspond.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Dislike it? I will lick the stamps
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: You are amazing, Violet. You
dialog: haven't won, you know.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I don't believe in defeat. But we
dialog: can hammer this out when you come
dialog: back to stay, you and Lucy, when
dialog: you've finished your tour of duty.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: You mean I am once more a member of
dialog: this family?
text: Violet smiles. The Queen makes a gesture and Maud goes.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: She's right, you know. Brompton is
dialog: gone. And you must all learn to
dialog: live with it.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I think we can get it back. For
dialog: Tom, at least. That's why we need
dialog: the girl back here.
speaker_heading: ISOBEL
dialog: Oh, Violet. After all these years,
dialog: you still astonish me.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Good. I'm glad I'm a revelation and
dialog: not a disappointment.
text: Meanwhile, the King stops Bertie and Edith as they pass.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: There you are, Hexham. I'm sad you
dialog: can't be part of the Prince's tour.
dialog: But we'll find something else for
dialog: you to do.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Sir, I didn't-
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE
dialog: I understood why not as soon as Her
dialog: Majesty had explained it to me.
text: Edith and Bertie look to the Queen who smiles.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: Congratulations to you both.
text: They drop back.
text: Bertie starts to talk to Henry but we follow Edith who is
text: joined by Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You're looking very sunny tonight.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: I'm happy. Why? Does it bother you?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No. But tell me, what are you
dialog: playing at with Tom and Cousin
dialog: Maud's famous maid?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I heard you at dinner last night.
dialog: What are you up to?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: You know she'll inherit the
dialog: Brompton estate.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So Mama told me.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Well, then? Wouldn't you like Tom
dialog: to have a proper establishment?
text: Mary stares at her.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You devious cat.

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I just want a word with Granny.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM. HAREWOOD. NIGHT.
text: Violet and Mary are together in an empty drawing room.

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: How long were you planning to wait
dialog: before you told us why you really
dialog: went up to London on Wednesday?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Since you ask, I haven't decided.
dialog: So, if I tell you now, will you
dialog: promise to keep it to yourself?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I promise.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Very well. I had some medical tests
dialog: a few weeks ago, and I went up to
dialog: London to hear the results.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: And I may not have long to live. It
dialog: won't be too quick. But, of course,
dialog: you can never get a London doctor
dialog: to be precise.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh, Granny.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, no, my dear, save your tears
dialog: for something sad. There's nothing
dialog: sad here. I have lived a privileged
dialog: and an interesting life. And now
dialog: it's time to go.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm leaving the family and the

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I know Papa will be-
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh, no. I don't mean your father. I
dialog: love him dearly. No, I mean you.
dialog: You are the future of Downton.

dialog: Just tell me.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Leave Downton? I think we're stuck

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes, I believe we are.
