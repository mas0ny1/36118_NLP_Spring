text: to the brother’s room.
scene_heading: INT. LISA'S DAD’S HOME/BROTHER’S BEDROOM - MORNING 107A
text: Lisa, with the field hockey stick, darts silently to behind
text: a bookcase just inside the door -~ in good position to nail
text: Rippner if he comes in.
text: (Note: Behind her, we see a bathroom that we can guess leads
text: to her bedroom. ) .
text: She raises the stick over her head, waiting for him.
text: But Rippner doesn’t come through the door more than a step
text: when he stops, suddenly wary -- he giances back into the
text: hallway, as if unsure if his strategy is sound.
scene_heading: IN THE FOREGROUND ~ LISA

speaker_heading: ON LISA
text: She can’t take the suspense any longer -- she hazards a look
text: Rippner is gone from the room, but she can still hear his
text: breathing, just beyond that doorway.
text: She ponders her next move. Rippner’s definitely just a few
text: feet, maybe a few inches away out there, invisible but clearly
text: hear-able, until — his breathing suddenly stops.
text: There’s a beat of RACKING ST. .
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON LISA
text: What the hell? She moves out of hiding and warily approaches
text: the doorway to the hall.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - ON LISA
text: Her look of confusion tells us Rippner’s not out there.
text: Lisa jerks around, looking back at the bathroom and its
text: passageway into her room. Shit. Rippner might be circling
dialog: around!
text: Stick ready, she darts through the
scene_heading: BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 107B
text: To the door that leads to her bedroom. Shuts and locks it.
scene_heading: ANGLE: CLOSE BEHIND LISA
text: She puts her ear to the door. Doesn‘t hear anything. She

text: breath outside her brother’s bedroom door, or worse -—- shit -—
text: is he behind the shower curtain? She whips it back. No

dialog: door to bathroom door --
text: Holding her breath, she reaches for the cordless phone on
text: the table. Her life might depend on her not making a sound —
text: so she doesn't even breath as she does this.
text: ON HER FINGERS — just about to touch the phone — when it
text: EXPLODES in a nerve-shattering RIIIIIIIIIING! Lisa grabs
text: the phone and hits “talk.” Only listens — not risking using
text: her own voice.**

dialog: he bathr: door to her bi !
text: She screams or we scream —— not important which — as Rippner
text: attacks, knife high. There’s a brief but terrifying struggle
text: — he’s slashing at her, feinting, thrusting... But she’s
text: also taking a toll on him — she’s damn fast with that stick
text: — she gets a couple of good ones — even catching him on
text: the wrist so hard that he loses control of the knife. It
text: flies out the door, clattering to the floor.

text: struggle as she swings again. Rippner sidesteps, grabs out
text: —- and suddenly has a grim hold on the stick.
text: This happens near the doorway to the hall. He spins her
text: around, slams her against the door (now it’s back wide open
text: again), flings her stick away — then they grapple. Both
text: nearly lose their balance, and they reel out through the
dialog: door onto the
scene_heading: SECOND FLOOR LANDING - CONTINUOUS 107D
text: Where Rippner SLAMS her against the wall --
text: But Lisa still has plenty of fight left —- she attempts a
text: knee to the groin, her hands claw for his eyes, but none of
text: it works. She’s pinned within moments. But she never takes
text: her eyes off him, never flinches or looks scared. Her face
text: is a study in fury and defiance.
text: It’s overwhelmingly clear that far from being afraid of him,
text: she’s just seeing him at last for what he is:
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You're pathetic.
text: And it’s almost as if we see Rippner see himself in the mirror
text: of her eyes -~ He sees that, and he can’t bear to look at
text: it. In frustration, Rippner tosses Lisa UP and OVER the
text: railing. Lisa, wide-eyed, SCREAMS as she flips back, TUMBLING
text: DOWN THE STAIRCASE to the first landing in the
speaker_heading: ENTRY HALL 108
text: below. Lisa's barely conscious. Unmoving. Her eyes flutter
text: open, catching Rippner, out of focus, making his way down

dialog: something
