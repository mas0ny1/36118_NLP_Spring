dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't talk about THIS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
speaker_heading: (DELICATELY)
dialog: Then write about it.

speaker_heading: NICK
speaker_heading: (SKEPTICAL)
dialog: Write?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Yes. Write.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Why would I do that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: After all, you said that writing

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, well. It didn't bring anyone

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No one need ever read it. You can

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What would I write about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Anything. Whatever you can't quite
dialog: talk about; a memory; a thought; a

dialog: CLOSE ON: Nick considering the challenge...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: A place...

dialog: 
text: HIGH AND WIDE: A vast dumping ground comprised of massive

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
text: New York's dumping ground, half way

dialog: 
text: IMAGES illustrate the poverty and hopelessness of life here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: ...Where the burnt out coal that

dialog: was discarded by men who moved

dialog: 
text: A train waits at a drawbridge spanning a small, foul creek.

speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: ...This fantastic farm was ever-

speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: Tom had invited me to town, on the
dialog: pretense of a lunch at the Yale

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)

speaker_heading: TOM

scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hello Wilson! How's business?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILSON
speaker_heading: (UNCONVINCING)
dialog: I can't complain. When are you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I've got my man working on it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Works pretty slow, don't he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
speaker_heading: (COLDLY)

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: If its business you're talking, you

dialog: (to her husband)
dialog: Get some chairs why don't you; so
dialog: somebody can sit down...

scene_heading: INT. MYRTLE'S APARTMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: The muffled sounds of sex...
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: A puppy mouthing a soggy dog biscuit that dissolves
text: into a saucer of milk.
dialog: 
text: Nick, horrified, perches on a couch in a small room stuffed
text: with tacky, pretentious objects; obviously bought by Tom.
dialog: 
text: Nick springs to his feet and yanks open the front door, only
text: to be startled by a slender, louche girl in her twenties,
text: with a sticky bob of red hair. This is CATHERINE.
dialog: 
text: She sweeps into the room, pivots, and extends her hand.

speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'm Catherine; ain't we havin' a
dialog: party?

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, I'm... I'm not sure now's a

speaker_heading: MRS. MCKEE

speaker_heading: MR. MCKEE

speaker_heading: MRS. MCKEE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: What's the matter? Don't ya like
dialog: me?
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY! The bedroom door whooshes open and Myrtle appears
text: wearing an astounding, red jersey sheath dress.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. MCKEE
dialog: Myrtle Turtle...! Oh, that dress is
dialog: adorable!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: (with impressive hauteur)
dialog: It's just a crazy old thing. I slip
dialog: it on when I don't care what I look
dialog: like!
dialog: 
text: Tom appears behind Myrtle, arrogantly buttoning his shirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Get some ice Myrtle, before

dialog: 
text: Myrtle sweeps into the kitchen; Tom opens the liquor cabinet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK

dialog: Tom, I really should be going...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (grabbing Nick's arm)
dialog: Nonsense...

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Tom; I don't think-- Daisy's my--
dialog: 
text: Tom pulls Nick back toward the party.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Listen Nick, you like to watch; I
dialog: remember that from college. And
dialog: that's OK, I make no judgment; but
dialog: we've got a whole summer - do you
dialog: want to sit on the sideline and
dialog: watch, or do you want to play ball?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yeah. Ain't we good enough for ya?
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Catherine winks, pushes Nick into his chair, and fearlessly
text: lands herself in his lap.

speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Take off yer hat and stay awhile...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hey Nick! McKee's in the artistic

speaker_heading: MCKEE
dialog: Photography.

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Nick's artistic.

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No...

speaker_heading: MCKEE
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ah, no, well, I write a little...
dialog: 
text: Tom clunks the gramophone needle onto a record and Catherine
text: raises her voice above the music.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Do you live on Long Island, too?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I live at West Egg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Really? I was there at a party
dialog: about a month ago. At a man named
dialog: Gatsby's. Do you know him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I live right next door to him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: He's a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's.

speaker_heading: MYRTLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not one of those models...! But
dialog: you can if you want...

speaker_heading: CATHERINE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Doesn't she like Wilson either?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
speaker_heading: (OVERHEARS)
dialog: ...He's a greasy little scumbag!
dialog: 
text: Tom grins arrogantly and offers a drink to Catherine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: No thanks; I feel just as good on
dialog: nothing at all...
dialog: 
text: With a suggestive glimpse of tongue, Catherine pops a pill...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nerve pills, I get them from a
dialog: doctor in Queens. You want one?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: My nerves are fine thanks...
dialog: 
text: Catherine smiles mischievously, puts a pill on her tongue and
text: suddenly kisses Nick... He splutters, but Catherine tips the
text: scotch to his mouth, washing the pill down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: I had been drunk just twice in my
dialog: life and the second time was that
dialog: afternoon...
dialog: 
text: DISSOLVE TO: Blurry freakish images of time passing... The
text: whiskey is in demand by all; Catherine dances a solo. The
text: music is sexy, dirty, deafening. The images become wilder,
dialog: nauseatingly violent...
dialog: 
text: As Catherine undresses Nick...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
text: That night, in the hidden flat that
dialog: Tom kept for Myrtle, we were buoyed
text: by a sort of chemical madness, a
dialog: willingness of the heart that burst
dialog: thunderously upon us all... And
dialog: suddenly, I began to like New York.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As the puppy sits on the table groaning faintly through the
text: smoke, Myrtle suddenly springs to her feet!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: ...I've got to get a massage, and a
text: wave, and a collar for the dog, and
dialog: one of those cute little ash-trays
dialog: where you touch a spring, and a
text: wreath with a black silk bow for
dialog: mother's grave!
dialog: 
text: Pivoting through the smoky air, Myrtle begins to strip...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRTLE (CONT'D)
dialog: My dear I'm giving you this dress!
dialog: 
text: Myrtle strips as Mrs. McKee greedily lunges for the dress.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. MCKEE
dialog: Adorable! Adorable!
dialog: 
text: SUDDEN CUT: Nick, very drunk, finds himself at the bathroom
text: window, observing the infinite life of the city...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: High over the city our yellow
dialog: windows must have contributed their
dialog: share of human secrets to the
text: casual watcher in the street...

scene_heading: INT. SANITARIUM - NICK'S ROOM - WINTER - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. THE STREET BELOW MYRTLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Nick, simultaneously in the street below, can see himself
text: upstairs looking out from Myrtle's window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: I was within and without; enchanted
text: and repelled by the inexhaustible
dialog: variety of life...
dialog: 
text: POETIC VISUAL: The Manhattan skyline - millions of lighted
text: windows frame silhouettes of this inexhaustible humanity...
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MYRTLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY WE HEAR Tom violently yelling!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You've got no right to speak her
dialog: name!
dialog: 
text: Tom and Myrtle emerge from the bedroom half-dressed...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! I'll speak it
dialog: whenever I want! Daisy! Dai--
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY! A short, sharp movement, Tom breaks Myrtle's nose!
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Nick. AS MYRTLE SCREAMS, BLOOD FLIES ACROSS THE
text: ROOM IN ABSTRACT SLOW MOTION!
dialog: 
text: PULL OUT: Through the window; this drama becomes merely one
dialog: more of the countless many that play out in this vast city...

scene_heading: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I have no clue how I got home.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - PORCH - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Nick is still asleep. Harsh morning light.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: His eyelids slowly flutter awake.
dialog: 
text: He realizes he's been sleeping on the porch in his underwear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: But I do know that I awoke with a
dialog: distinctly uneasy feeling...
dialog: 
text: His pants lie next to him, his shirt is on the railing, his
text: jacket is in a tree, and his car is parked in the bushes...
dialog: 
text: A sudden feeling of disquiet makes Nick look up...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: ....that Gatsby was watching me.
dialog: 27.

scene_heading: INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY

text: The Doctor leans forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
scene_heading: (SLIGHTLY INCREDULOUS)
dialog: Watching you...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I
dialog: know now that Gatsby was always
dialog: watching me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: And how do you know that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Because I got an invitation... I
dialog: was the only one.
dialog: 
text: FADE IN IMAGE: An immaculate CHAUFFEUR, in uniform of robin's
text: egg blue, stands on Nick's doorstep, holding a silver tray on
dialog: which rests an invitation...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK(CONT'D)
dialog: No one, except me, every received

speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: You see, the rest of New York
dialog: simply came, uninvited...
dialog:

speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: The whole city packed into

speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: And I mean everyone: from every
dialog: walk of life, from every corner of
dialog: New York City, this kaleidoscopic

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - HALL OF MASTERS - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - TWILIGHT

speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)

speaker_heading: (TO TEDDY)

speaker_heading: OWL EYES

dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: As the music nears its final crescendo, the evening's many
text: fantastical characters dance uproariously around the pool!!!
dialog: 
text: On an elaborate flotilla in the center of it all Jordan and
text: Nick are kicking a wild Charleston. The number finally peaks!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I didn't expect all this...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JORDAN
speaker_heading: (COY)
dialog: What did you expect?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: TEDDY
speaker_heading: (TO NICK)
dialog: Penny-less pantywaist!
dialog:

speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm stealing her away Carraway!
dialog: 
text: Over wild applause, the ORCHESTRA LEADER announces...

speaker_heading: ORCHESTRA LEADER
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, please make
dialog: your way to the grand terrazzo; for
dialog: the premiere of Mr. Vladimir
dialog: Tostoff's "A Jazz History of the

dialog: 
text: Nick follow Jordan, but Teddy cuts him off--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Look around you! Rich girls don't
dialog: marry poor boys--
dialog: 
text: On cue, a drinks tray floats into frame. There is a flurry of
text: movement... Teddy rudely snatches a couple of martinis...
dialog: 
text: Nick, disoriented and empty-handed, begins up the stairs, and
text: as he does so, hears the voice of the man holding the tray...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Your face is familiar. Weren't you
dialog: in the Third Division during the
dialog: war?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes; The Ninth Battalion.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: THE MAN. He is tanned and handsome; just past thirty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I was in the Seventh. I knew I'd
dialog: seen you somewhere before... Having
dialog: a good time, old sport?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
speaker_heading: (VERY TIPSY)
dialog: The whole thing's incredible - I
dialog: live next door...
dialog: (brandishing his now
scene_heading: CRUMPLED INVITATION)
dialog: He even sent me an invitation, but
dialog: I still haven't met Mr. Gatsby, no
dialog: one's met him; they say he's third
dialog: cousin to the Kaiser and second
dialog: cousin to the devil!
dialog: 
text: At the landing, half way up the steps, the man takes a drink

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
speaker_heading: (APOLOGETICALLY)
dialog: I thought you knew, old sport.
dialog: 
text: Gatsby smiles a dazzling smile; sound fades to a serene hum.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: His smile was one of those rare
dialog: smiles that you may come across
dialog: four or five times in life. It
dialog: seemed to understand you and
dialog: believe in you just as you would
dialog: like to be understood and believed
dialog: in.
dialog: 
text: All at once the bubble bursts, a silver-haired, fifty-ish man
text: in an immaculate tail-suit, (HERZOG) leans into Gatsby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERZOG
dialog: Excuse me sir; Chicago on the wire.
dialog: 
text: Gatsby nods, but before he departs he smiles at Nick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What time?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Any time that suits you.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Lovely to see you Miss Baker.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He kisses her lightly on the hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO NICK)
dialog: If you need anything, just ask for
dialog: it, old sport. I will rejoin you
dialog: later... Excuse me.
dialog: 
text: As Nick watches Gatsby walk away, he whispers with amazement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I expected him to be...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Old and fat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, yes; young men don't just
text: drift coolly out of nowhere and buy
dialog: a palace on Long Island.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: He told me once he was an Oxford

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: I don't know... I just don't

speaker_heading: HERZOG

speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)

speaker_heading: HERZOG
dialog: Yes, madame.

dialog: 
text: Seeing Nick, she rushes to him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Nick! Nick! I've just heard the

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Where have you been!? The car's

speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Simply amazing! It all makes sense.

scene_heading: EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What makes sense...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JORDAN

speaker_heading: JORDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And I swore I wouldn't tell.

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: JORDAN

dialog: 
text: The car takes off and Nick is left staring; mystified...

text: A voice startles him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Sorry to keep her from you, old
dialog: sport. Don't forget; we're going up

dialog:

speaker_heading: HERZOG

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Good night, old sport...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Good night. Thank you.
dialog: 
text: Gatsby nods warmly, and turns inside.
dialog: 
text: As Nick walks away he is confronted by a bizarre scene: a big
text: crowd gathers around a COUPÉ, resting on its side in a ditch.
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY! Owl Eyes pops from the wreck. He leers drunkenly...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OWL EYES
dialog: Whazza matter!? We run outta gas!?
dialog: 
text: The beep of a horn catches Nick's attention. Jordan, leaning
text: out of the window of her car as it sweeps away, calls to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Come and see me... We'll have tea!
dialog: I'm in the phone-book!
dialog: 
text: Nick waves, smiles, and cuts across the lawn.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - TOWER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: High up in the window, the shadowy figure of Gatsby stands,
text: phone pressed to his ear, watching Nick. After a moment, he
text: raises his hand in formal farewell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O)
dialog: We rode in the hydroplane... And I
dialog: attended two more of his parties,
dialog: even made use of his beach. But I
dialog: soon realized that I knew
dialog: absolutely nothing about Gatsby at
dialog: all, until...
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - MORNING
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. NICK'S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Gatsby's yellow Duesenberg hurtles up Nick's drive and skids
text: to a stop.
dialog: 
text: Nick emerges to his porch.
dialog: 
text: Gatsby leaps out!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Its pretty isn't it, old sport...?

speaker_heading: SLAM CUT TO:

dialog: anyhow?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: My... opinion?

dialog:

speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Yes, yes, your opinion!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't want you to get the wrong
dialog: impression from all those bizarre

dialog: pack of lies I assure you. You've
dialog: heard the stories...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
speaker_heading: WELL--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: I'll tell you God's truth. God's
dialog: truth about myself!
dialog: (raises right hand)
dialog: I am the son of some very wealthy
dialog: people from the Middle-West; sadly,
dialog: all dead now... I was brought up in
dialog: America, but educated at Oxford;
dialog: because all my ancestors have been
dialog: educated there for many years. You
dialog: see, it's a... a family tradition.
dialog: 
text: As Gatsby's speech continues at breakneck speed... Nick's
text: V.O. fades up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: The way he spoke... No wonder
dialog: people thought he was lying...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: After that I lived like a young
dialog: Prince in all the capitals of
dialog: Europe!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Europe?
dialog: 
text: Barrelling around a blind turn, Gatsby wrenches at the wheel
text: and maniacally overtakes a truck laden with farmhands...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Yes, Europe! Paris; Venice; Rome;
dialog: Vienna, Zurich, Helsinki...
text: Collecting jewels, chiefly rubies,
dialog: hunting big game, painting, a

dialog: and trying to forget something very
dialog: sad that happened to me long ago...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: It was a great relief and I tried

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: He became a war hero, single-

dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He speaks with sudden, subdued emotion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: In the Argonne Forest I took my
dialog: machine gun detachment so far
dialog: forward... We were outnumbered five
dialog: to one. There was a half mile gap
dialog: on either side of us where the
dialog: infantry couldn't advance. We
dialog: stayed there two days and two

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I was promoted to Major and every

dialog: Here's another thing that I always

dialog: days; the man on my left is now the
dialog: Earl of Doncaster.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The photograph. Young men in blazers loaf in front
text: of Oxford College. Gatsby stands with a cricket bat in hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: What could I say...? The photograph
dialog: was undoubtedly authentic. Could it

dialog: 
text: DING! The gate lifts. And as Gatsby peels out, towards New

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY (O.S.)
dialog: But don't take my word for it. At

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: One of your old Oxford pals?

speaker_heading: GATSBY

speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: Possibly, it had occurred to Gatsby

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Or wait a minute; it's the
dialog: opposite...
dialog: 
text: Tom stands and strolls to the open French window...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
text: The sun is getting colder every
dialog: year...
dialog: 
text: Daisy grips a wine glass in her trembling hand; her eyes are
text: terrified, perspiration forms on her upper lip. She glances
text: to Gatsby, who stares resolutely from across the table.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: A perspiring Nick. He glances from Daisy to Gatsby.
dialog: 
text: The tension is excruciating.
dialog: 
text: Out the window Tom catches sight of a sailboat across the
dialog: bay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: How I'd like to be out on that bay
dialog: today.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He looks up. Beyond the sailboat, he can
text: see the outline of his castle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: I'm right across from you.
speaker_heading: (POINTS)
dialog: Right there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
speaker_heading: (UNIMPRESSED)
dialog: So you are.
dialog: 
text: Gatsby slowly stands and walks behind Daisy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Every night I can see that light at
dialog: the end of your dock, blinking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What light?
dialog: 
text: Gatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy's...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: You see, Mr. Buchanan, I wanted to
dialog: be close-- Daisy and I--
dialog: 
text: With sudden intensity Daisy stands!
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (on the verge of tears)
dialog: It's so hot...
dialog: 
text: Agitated, she sweeps toward the sideboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything's so confused.
dialog: 
text: She plucks a cigarette from a carved box, and fumbles with
text: the paperweight-sized lighter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY (CONT'D)
dialog: What'll we do with ourselves this
dialog: afternoon...? And the day after
dialog: that...
dialog: (she snaps it again)
dialog: ...and for the next thirty years?
speaker_heading: (TURNS SUDDENLY)
dialog: Let's all go to town! Who wants to
dialog: go to town?
dialog: 
text: Her nervous hands drop the lighter, which crashes to the
text: mahogany floor. All but Tom recoil in shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Town!? Women... They get these
dialog: notions...
dialog: 
text: Gatsby walks to Daisy... As Tom puffs, Gatsby retrieves the
text: lighter in one hand, and with his other gently guides Daisy's
text: trembling hand... In that moment, their eyes tenderly meet...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Daisy...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (as if they are alone)
dialog: You look so cool. You always look
dialog: so cool, like the advertisement of
dialog: the man... in Times Square...
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Tom, his jaw tightening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY (CONT'D)
text: The man in the cool, beautiful,
dialog: shirts.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA FLOATS TOWARD TOM... He violently snuffs his cigar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: She had told Gatsby that she loved
dialog: him - and Tom had seen...
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY Tom explodes!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Let's go to town! I'm perfectly
dialog: willing...! That's a marvelous
dialog: idea! Henri! Have the car brought
dialog: around immediately!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Just like that? Can't anyone at
dialog: least have a cigarette?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We've smoked all through lunch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Oh, let's have fun. It's too hot to
dialog: fuss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It was your great idea Daisy. Why
dialog: don't we!? We'll all go to town!
dialog: 
text: Daisy doesn't budge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I've changed my mind...
speaker_heading: (TEASES)
dialog: You brute.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (a dangerous intensity)
dialog: You've got me all excited, and now
dialog: you don't want to go? We'll get a
dialog: great big room at the Plaza, a cold
dialog: bucket of ice, and some whiskey...
dialog: It will be fun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Fine. Have it your own way, Tom...
dialog: Come on, Jordan.
dialog: 
text: As she and Jordan rush past Tom, down the hall, Tom turns
text: calmly to Gatsby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby?
dialog: 
text: Then turns and calls to Henri...
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Henri! Get some whiskey! Two
text: bottles, wrapped in a towel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Shoes shifting on gravel. Gatsby and Nick stand
text: uncomfortably on the drive, waiting for Tom and the women.
dialog: 
text: BANG! Tom storms out wrapping a quart bottle in a towel.
dialog: 
text: Daisy and Jordan follow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Mr. Gatsby! Would you be good
dialog: enough to take my coupé? And I'll
dialog: drive everyone else in your circus
dialog: wagon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: I don't think there's much gas, old
dialog: sport.
dialog: 
text: Gatsby looks to Daisy, a burning stare.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (looks at the gauge)
dialog: Plenty of gas. And if we run out,
dialog: then we'll stop at a drug store.
dialog: I hear you can buy anything at a
dialog: drug store nowadays...
dialog: (savagely eyes Gatsby)
dialog: Isn't that right, Mr. Gatsby?
dialog: 
text: A moment of sharp tension; Daisy wrenches from Tom's arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You take Nick and Jordan, Tom!
dialog: 
text: She slips quickly into the coupé...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll meet you at the Plaza! I'll
dialog: be the man on the corner smoking
dialog: two cigarettes...
dialog: 
text: Gatsby's and Tom's eyes flash; a harsh, competitive glance.
dialog: 
text: Tom lunges into the Duesenberg, slams the gears and lurches
text: away, leaving Gatsby, Daisy, and the coupé in the dust.
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. GATSBY'S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tom throttles forward, watching Jordan and Nick...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You think I'm pretty dumb, don't
dialog: you? But I have a-- an almost
dialog: second sight, sometimes, that tells
dialog: me what to do. And I've made a
dialog: small investigation of this fellow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JORDAN
speaker_heading: (CONDESCENDING)
dialog: And you found he was an Oxford man?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oxford, New Mexico! He wears a pink
dialog: suit for Christ's sake!
dialog: 
text: With that, Tom shifts gears and the Duesenberg rockets on!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - WILSON'S GARAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: SCRREEECH! Tom slams the breaks and the Duesenberg slides to
dialog: a stop at Wilson's...
dialog: 
text: Wilson doesn't budge. He's staring with sickly eyes at the
text: giant billboard of Dr. T. J. Eckleberg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Wilson! Wilson! What are you
dialog: waiting for!? Let's have some
dialog: gas...
speaker_heading: (GETS OUT)
dialog: Do I have to do it myself?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I'm sick. I'm all run down. I need
dialog: money bad... My wife and I want to
dialog: go West.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Your wife does...?
dialog: 
text: Tom glances up to the window above the garage. Myrtle's face,
text: badly bruised, stares back. Tom clocks this, and hesitates...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
text: Tom was feeling the hot whips of
text: panic. His mistress and wife, an
dialog: hour ago so secure, were both
dialog: slipping from his control...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I just got wised-up to something
dialog: funny the last two days. She's
dialog: goin' whether she wants to or not.
dialog: 
text: Tom isn't listening... He sees the coupe approaching at high-
text: speed, threatening to leave him in the dust!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What do I owe you!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Dollar twenty.
dialog: 
text: The blue coupé flashes by. Tom glances back to Myrtle... And
text: then jumps into the Duesenberg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You can have the car! I'll send it
dialog: around tomorrow!
dialog: 
text: He throws coins into the dirt for Wilson to collect. Then he
text: floors the gas and peels out after the coupé!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. GATSBY'S CAR/TOM'S COUPÉ - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
text: As Tom and Gatsby shoot dangerous glances at one another,
text: Daisy waves carefree back to Tom....
dialog: 
text: PAN UP: The cars tear over the Queensboro Bridge, toward the
text: glimmering, golden city...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT TO:
dialog: 100.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLAZA HOTEL. SUITE - DAY
dialog: 
text: CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Shards of ice spilt off from a hunk as a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: That's enough...
dialog: 
text: The room is large and stifling hot, it has been filled with
text: huge ice buckets in an attempt to cool it. Gatsby, Tom, Nick,
text: Daisy and Jordan are bathed in a thin sheen of perspiration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Open another window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: There aren't any more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Then telephone for an axe...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Forget about the heat. You make it
text: worse by crabbing about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Why not let her alone, old sport?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: That's a great expression of yours,
dialog: isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: What is?
dialog: 
text: Tom turns to Gatsby...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: 'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it
dialog: up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Now see here, Tom; if you're going
dialog: to make personal remarks I won't
dialog: stay here one minute.
dialog: 
text: Gatsby's foot beats a restless tattoo; Tom eyes him suddenly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an
dialog: Oxford man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: No, not exactly.
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oh yes, I understand you went to
dialog: Oxford.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Yes - I went there.
dialog: 
text: Tom's laugh is incredulous and insulting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Sure; the man in the pink suit went
dialog: to Oxford!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Tom...!
dialog: 
text: Gatsby stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: (slow, intense)
dialog: I told you I went there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I heard you, but I'd like to know
dialog: when.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: You'd like to know when....? It was
dialog: in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed
dialog: five months. That's why I can't
dialog: exactly call myself an Oxford man.
dialog: 
text: Tom glances around to see if the others mirror his disbelief.
text: But they are all looking at Gatsby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You see, it was an opportunity they
dialog: gave to some of the officers who
dialog: actually fought in the war.
dialog: 
text: Nick can't help but smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby
text: on the back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I'll make you a drink Tom, then you
dialog: won't seem so stupid to yourself...
dialog: 
text: But Tom's not done yet.
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Wait a minute, I want to ask Mr.
dialog: Gatsby one more question.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Go on. Please Mr. Buchanan, go on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What kind of a row are you trying
dialog: to cause in my house anyhow?
dialog: 
text: They are out in the open at last and Gatsby is content.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: He isn't causing a row; you're
dialog: causing a row. Please have a little
dialog: self-control!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Self-control! I suppose the latest
dialog: thing is to sit back and let Mr.
dialog: Nobody from Nowhere make love to
dialog: your wife? Well, if that's the idea
dialog: you can count me out... See,
text: nowadays people begin by sneering
dialog: at family life and family
dialog: institutions and next you know
dialog: they'll throw everything overboard
dialog: and we'll have intermarriage
dialog: between black and white!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: We're all white here, Tom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Your wife doesn't love you. She's
dialog: never loved you. She loves me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You must be crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: No, old sport. See, she never loved
dialog: you... She only married you because
dialog: I was poor and she was tired of
dialog: waiting. It was a terrible,
dialog: terrible mistake, but in her heart
dialog: she never loved anyone but me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: We should go...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Daisy and I have nothing to hide...
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Jay let's go, please...!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Sit down Daisy!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
speaker_heading: (REASSURING)
dialog: Yes, Daisy, please sit down.
dialog: 
text: Tom's voice gropes unsuccessfully for the paternal note.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What's been going on? I want to
dialog: hear all about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: I just told you what's been going
dialog: on; its been going on for five
dialog: years...!
dialog: 
text: Tom turns to Daisy sharply.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You've been seeing him for five
dialog: years?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Not seeing. No, we couldn't; but
dialog: both of us loved each other all
dialog: that time, old sport, and you
dialog: didn't know. I used to laugh
dialog: sometimes, to think that you didn't
dialog: know...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oh - that's all; you're crazy! I
dialog: can't speak about what happened
dialog: five years ago, because I didn't
dialog: know Daisy then - but I'll be
dialog: damned if I see how you got within
dialog: a mile of her unless you brought
text: the groceries to the back door. But
dialog: all the rest of that's a god-damned
dialog: lie. Daisy loved me when she
dialog: married me and she loves me now.
dialog: 
text: Tom starts to make himself a drink...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: No...
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: She does, though... And what's
dialog: more, I love Daisy too. Once in a
dialog: while I go off on a spree, but I
dialog: always come back, and in my heart I
dialog: love her all the time...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You're revolting...
dialog: 
text: Daisy's voice drops an octave lower, filling the room with
text: thrilling scorn...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know why we left Chicago...?
dialog: I'm surprised they didn't treat you
dialog: to the story of that little spree.
dialog: 
text: Gatsby walks over and stands beside Daisy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: That's all over now. Just tell him
dialog: the truth, that you never loved
dialog: him; and all this... all this pain
dialog: will be wiped out forever.
dialog: 
text: Daisy looks at Gatsby blindly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Why, how could I love him,
dialog: possibly?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: You never loved him.
dialog: 
text: Daisy hesitates; too late, she realizes what she is doing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I never loved him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: That's right...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Not at Kapiolani?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (a husky tenderness)
dialog: Not that day I carried you down
dialog: from the Punch Bowl to keep your
dialog: shoes dry...? Daisy? Never?
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Please don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Daisy...
dialog: 
text: Her voice is cold, but the anger is gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: There, Jay.
dialog: 
text: She trembles as she looks to Gatsby...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY (CONT'D)
dialog: You want too much! I love you now;
dialog: isn't that enough? I can't help
dialog: what's past.
dialog: (begins to sob)
dialog: I did love him once; but I loved
dialog: you too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: (shocked, uncomprehending)
dialog: You loved me too?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
speaker_heading: (SAVAGE)
dialog: Even that's a lie. She didn't know
dialog: you were alive. There are things
dialog: between Daisy and me that you'll
dialog: never know, things that neither of
dialog: us can ever forget.
dialog: 
text: The words seem to bite physically into Gatsby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: I want to speak to Daisy alone.
dialog: She's all excited now...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Even alone I can't say I never
dialog: loved Tom. It wouldn't be true.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Of course it wouldn't.
dialog: 
text: Daisy turns to her husband.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: As if it mattered to you.
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Of course it matters. I'm going to
dialog: take better care of you from now
dialog: on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: You're not taking care of her any
dialog: more! Daisy's leaving you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Nonsense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (with visible effort)
dialog: I am, though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: She's not leaving me; and certainly
dialog: not for a common swindler!
dialog: 
text: Tom's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you
dialog: anyhow? You see, I have made a
dialog: small investigation into your
dialog: affairs... You're one of Meyer
dialog: Wolfsheim's bunch.
dialog: 
text: Tom turns to the others and speaks rapidly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: See, he and this Wolfsheim bought
dialog: up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold
dialog: bootlegged alcohol over the
dialog: counter!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: What about it, old sport?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Don't call me `old sport!' This
dialog: drug store business is just small
dialog: change compared to the bonds stunt
dialog: you and Wolfsheim have got going on
dialog: now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Well your friend Walter Chase isn't
dialog: too proud to come in on it.
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I've been giving that some thought.
dialog: How does a reputable banker like
text: Walter Chase find himself up to his
text: eyeballs in debt to a little kike
dialog: like Wolfsheim?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: It's called `greed,' old sport.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: That's right; you've got half of
dialog: Wall Street out there swilling your
dialog: free booze at that fun park every
dialog: weekend...
speaker_heading: (TO NICK)
dialog: I'm surprised he hasn't tried to
dialog: drag you in...
dialog: 
text: Nick looks away sharply. Tom registers this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: My God, he has...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: He's got nothing to do with--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: With your little racket...
speaker_heading: (TO DAISY)
dialog: Daisy... Can't you see who this guy
dialog: is? With his house and his parties
dialog: and his fancy clothes; he's just a
dialog: front for Wolfsheim, a gangster, to
dialog: get his claws into respectable folk
dialog: like Walter...!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: (a vicious sneer)
dialog: The only respectable thing about
dialog: you, old sport, is your money,
dialog: that's it, and now I've just as
dialog: much as you; so that means we're
dialog: equal!!
dialog: 
text: Tom smiles with smug, condescending scorn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oh no, no, we're different; I am,
dialog: (gesturing at Nick and
speaker_heading: JORDAN)
dialog: They are...
dialog: (now at Daisy)
speaker_heading: SHE IS;
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 108.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: we're all different from you - we
dialog: were born different, it's in our
dialog: blood, and nothing you do, or say,
dialog: or steal or dream up, can ever
dialog: change that... And a girl like
dialog: Daisy will never...!
dialog: 
text: Gatsby explodes with terrifying rage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
text: SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!!
dialog: 
text: Shock jolts the room. We float toward Gatsby. His rage-filled
text: eyes stare into the void, as, with all his willpower, he
text: restrains himself from ripping Tom apart...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O)
dialog: Gatsby looked, in that moment... as
dialog: if he had "killed a man."
dialog: 
text: Tom snorts a dismissive laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: That's right Mr. Gatsby, show us
dialog: those fine Oxford manners...
dialog: 
text: Gatsby recovers and turns to Diasy, who is trembling in the
text: corner, on the verge of tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: My sincerest apologies. I... I seem
dialog: to have lost my temper.
dialog: 
text: Struggling for self control, Gatsby turns toward her as if
text: Tom suddenly no longer exists.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Daisy darling... None of this has
dialog: any consequence. Don't listen to
dialog: him Daisy.
dialog: 
text: Daisy blanches; Gatsby, now desperate, babbles incoherently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going back to Louisville to
dialog: be married. Then we're going to
dialog: live together in our house; it's--
dialog: 
text: There is a feeling of excruciating unease in the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON: Nick.
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
text: He began talking excitedly, denying
dialog: everything... But with every word
dialog: Daisy was drawing further and
dialog: further into herself, until only
dialog: the dead dream fought on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Please Tom; I can't stand this
dialog: anymore!
dialog: 
text: Daisy is staring, terrified, courage gone; she looks to Tom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You two start on home...
speaker_heading: (TO GATSBY)
text: In Mr. Gatsby's car.
dialog: 
text: Daisy is alarmed now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on. He won't annoy you. I think
dialog: he realizes that his little
text: flirtation... is over.
dialog: 
text: Daisy, hysterical, runs from the room; Gatsby pursues her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATSBY
dialog: Daisy...!
dialog: 
text: Daisy and Gatsby are gone. A terrible silence fills the room.
text: Tom begins wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle in the towel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Want any of this? Jordan? Nick?
dialog: Nick?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Want any?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No... I just remembered - today's

speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
