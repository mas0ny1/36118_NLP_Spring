text: DOWN AND SHOOTS OVER JOHNNY'S SHOULDER at what he is gazing
text: at. It is a large photograph of Jane. CAMERA MOVES BACK TO A
text: MEDIUM SHOT as Johnny continues on his way, still absorbed

text: back from dream realms to the work-a-day world.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (murmuring an apology)
dialog: Sorry!
text: The passer-by has disappeared into the crowd. Johnny is about

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Hi, Johnny!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Beautiful morning!
text: By now he has reached an open elevator which is filling with
text: people. The door of the elevator next to it opens and starts
text: to discharge its passengers. A starter is stationed between
text: the two elevators. A definite reaction from the starter as
text: he sees Johnny. Johnny is about to enter the first elevator,
text: then, seeing that the second one is empty, starts toward it.
text: He finds his way barred by the starter who warmly grips his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: STARTER
dialog: "Morning, Mr. Mason.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE DOOR

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - GROUP AROUND JOHNNY
speaker_heading: AD LIB
dialog: A business trip. Huh?... Where's the
dialog: little woman, Johnny -- why didn't
dialog: you bring her along?... Is she one
dialog: of the Lodges or one of the Cabots?...
dialog: What's she got that I haven't got?...
dialog: You'd better be careful with your
dialog: expense account -- no extras now!...
dialog: That's what you get for going out of
dialog: town!... You old bluebeard, you!...
dialog: I'm going to sue you for breach of
dialog: promise!... Today our Johnny is a
dialog: man!...
speaker_heading: STENOGRAPHER
dialog: Johnny, what's she like?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Now wait a minute! I can't describe
dialog: her -- nobody could. But it just so
dialog: happens I've got a picture of her.
text: He opens up his brief case and produces the photograph
text: previously established. It is snatched out of his hand by
text: one of the clerks who rushes out of the scene with it. The
text: others rush after him. A chorus of whistles, screams and
text: other extravagant reactions.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JOHNNY
text: Excited and thrilled at the sensation caused by the mere
text: photograph of his bride, but trying not to show it. Carter
text: comes into Shot, carrying a batch of legal papers. He is the
dialog: type who has had but one love affair in all his life --
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Well, well, well!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Hello, Carter.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So you combined pleasure with
dialog: business! Wait till Judge Doolittle
dialog: hears about this, my boy!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Hears about what?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: About your getting married on his
dialog: time -- and without his consent --
dialog: (significantly)
dialog: Or his daughter's.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, what's she got to do about it?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (smirking)
dialog: Well, now, my boy -- the favorite
dialog: topic of conversation around these
dialog: parts has been that you and Miss
dialog: Doolittle --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Aw, Malarkey! Office talk, Carter.
dialog: Isn't a word of truth in it!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Judge Doolittle may not think so.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (fiercely)
dialog: Is that so? Well, if he doesn't like
dialog: it, he can lump it.
text: Before he can finish, the rest of the staff come into the
text: scene, following the clerk holding the photograph.
speaker_heading: AD LIB
dialog: (as clerk returns
dialog: photograph)
dialog: You never asked me for my picture,

dialog: that?... Johnny, has she got a
dialog: sister?... No wonder we couldn't
dialog: compete... I want one of them too!...
dialog: I wish the boss'd send me out of

scene_heading: MEDIUM SHOT - THE GROUP
text: Suddenly there is a melting away of the group around Johnny
text: as the clerks start for their cubicles and the stenos return

scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JOHNNY
text: He is suddenly alone -- the photograph of his new bride

speaker_heading: DOOLITTLE'S VOICE
dialog: Mason!

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, good morning, Judge Doolittle!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR
text: Judge Doolittle has entered and stands, frowning, in the
text: midst of rice and old shoes. He's a formidable old codger
text: who has terrified many a witness. Doolittle is somewhat deaf
text: and wears an acousticon arrangement to facilitate his hearing.
text: He has a habit of speaking in a very low voice, while all
dialog: his employees have been trained to raise their voices in
text: talking to him. Throughout the entire scene between Doolittle
text: and Johnny, Doolittle will speak in a low voice and Johnny
text: will speak loudly, almost shouting at times.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: What's all this mess?
text: CAMERA PANS him up to Johnny. Johnny takes off his hat.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Ah -- Well, it seems everybody around
dialog: here found out that I -- er -- I --
dialog: while I was in Boston --
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: What were you doing in Boston?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Why, you sent me sir. Don't you
dialog: remember you sent me up there to get
dialog: a deposition on the Higgins versus
dialog: Higgins case!
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Did you get it?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Well, what's all this? What's all
dialog: this horseplay about?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, while I was in Boston, after I
dialog: got the deposition I had a few hours
dialog: to spare and so I -- just a few hours --
dialog: and I --
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Go on! Go on!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Come into my office!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: CAMERA PANS with him as he strides toward his office, followed

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR OF DOOLITTLE'S PRIVATE OFFICE
text: Doolittle enters with Johnny.

text: with a smirk on his face; dry-washes his hands and exits
text: into his office.
scene_heading: INT. JUDGE DOOLITTLE'S PRIVATE OFFICE - MED. SHOT - AT
speaker_heading: DOOLITTLE'S DESK
text: On the wall behind the desk are two paintings. One of Judge
text: Doolittle in his magisterial robes and the other of Chief
text: Justice Hughes of the United States, in his robes. Doolittle
text: is seated at his desk glaring at Johnny who stands facing
text: him like a prisoner at the bar. Johnny has the brief case in
text: one hand and the framed picture of Jane in the other.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Where's the deposition?
text: Johnny lays Jane's photograph on the desk as he opens the
text: brief case and takes the deposition from it, which he hands,
dialog: folded, to Doolittle.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: There you are, sir.
text: As Doolittle opens up the paper to look at it, a letter falls
dialog: out.
scene_heading: INSERT: THE LETTER
text: Inside a large, hand-drawn heart, which covers the page of
dialog: note paper, is written:
dialog: To the party of the first part: I love you. (signed) Party

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (very much embarrassed)
dialog: Oh, that's -- that's just sort of a
dialog: letter.
text: Doolittle hands it back. Johnny stuffs the letter into his
text: pocket with increasing embarrassment. Doolittle adjusts his
text: glasses and starts to read the deposition. He addresses Johnny
text: without looking up.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: So you got married?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Doolittle looks up and glances significantly at a framed
text: picture on his desk.
scene_heading: INSERT: FRAMED PICTURE
text: It is a photograph of Doolittle's daughter and upon it is
dialog: written: "To Father, with love, Eunice."
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - AT DESK
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: I imagine this will be a surprise to
dialog: some people.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes, sir!
dialog: (catches himself as
dialog: he realizes the
dialog: significance of
dialog: Doolittle's glance
text: at the picture of
dialog: his daughter)
dialog: No, sir! I mean -- well -- I don't
dialog: know. It all happened rather suddenly.
dialog: You see, we met on Boston Common the
dialog: night I arrived, and I'd had a bite
dialog: at Thompson's Spa -- and then I took
text: a little stroll around the Common
dialog: and -- and I saw her standing there --
dialog: she was just standing there -- she
text: had a cinder in her eye.
text: Doolittle looks up suddenly from reading the deposition.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
text: In her eye.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Whose eye?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Jane -- Mrs. Mason -- my wife.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Of course, she wasn't my wife then --
dialog: she's my wife now, though. And I got
text: the cinder out of her eye and --
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: And you married her.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Quick work, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes, sir. Oh Judge, we knew -- we
dialog: knew the minute we looked at each
dialog: other -- we knew -- we knew the minute
dialog: we looked at each other.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: You did!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Last year there were nearly a half a
dialog: million divorces in this country.
dialog: Congratulations, Mason!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Thank you very much, sir.
text: An office boy comes in with papers he puts on Doolittle's
dialog: desk.
speaker_heading: OFFICE BOY
dialog: Mr. Hutch would like your opinion on
dialog: this, sir.
dialog: (he starts out, and
text: as he passes Johnny,
dialog: hands him a letter)
dialog: Oh, this is for you, Mr. Mason...
dialog: special messenger. It's marked "Rush -
dialog: Important."
dialog: (exits)
text: Johnny takes the letter, glances at the envelope, registers
text: delight. Then, aware of Doolittle's eyes fixed on him, he
text: hastily puts the letter in his pocket.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (glancing up from
dialog: papers office boy
dialog: brought in)
dialog: Rush? Important? What is it?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, it's nothing.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (severely)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh -- it's a letter from my wife.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Your wife? What did you do -- leave
dialog: her in Boston?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, no. She's right here, sir.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Here -- in town?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (the great cross-
dialog: examiner)
dialog: If your wife's in town, why did she
dialog: write you a letter?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, she likes to write letters,
dialog: Judge. Yes, it's a sort of little
dialog: custom we have. She wrote me a letter
dialog: the first day she met me, right as
dialog: soon as she got home. She's written
dialog: to me every day since. Even coming
dialog: down on the train together she wrote
dialog: me. You see, when I get a letter
dialog: from her, it's sort of like a sort
dialog: of visit, you see.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Hm -- mmm.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Judge -- we -- when two people get
dialog: married, they usually go on a
dialog: honeymoon.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: I didn't. I don't approve of
dialog: honeymoons -- waste of time!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Uh -- huh. Well, you know how women
dialog: are, and Mrs. Mason and I --
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: What about Higgins against Higgins?
dialog: You're the only one in the office
dialog: who knows this case and it's on the
dialog: calendar for next week.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: If I could get a continuance --
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Opposing counsel wouldn't consent.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: But I talked to Mr. Hornblow this
dialog: morning and he agreed to a
dialog: continuance.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Well, all right -- take a week.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: A week! Well, Judge, I'm afraid we
dialog: wouldn't be able to make it ina
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: We couldn't make it in a week!
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Make what?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: My wife and I had sort of planned a

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Oh, well -- take two weeks then.

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Yes?
text: CAMERA MOVES BACK to take in Johnny and Jane. Jane is sipping

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: And -- er -- We walked for quite

dialog: Thompson's Spa for a bite --
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (stymied)
dialog: And we had a bite.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Well! Rather an unconventional

text: There seems nothing else to say.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: These cookies are delicious!
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: They're made with sour cream.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (to Jane)
dialog: Are you visiting relatives here in
dialog: New York, my dear?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, yes and no. We -- Not exactly.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I came over with Johnny.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: From Boston? Together? Last night?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Why, yes, Mother, we thought that as
dialog: long as we were engaged --
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Engaged!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, I know how upset you must be,
dialog: Mrs. Mason. You know so little about
dialog: me -- and it all happened so suddenly --
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Well I should think it was sudden!
dialog: What did your family have to say
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I have no family.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (there is implied
dialog: criticism in the

dialog: Didn't John say something about your
dialog: taking a course in journalism?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes, but I gave it up after I met
dialog: Johnny.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes -- I'm sort of a post graduate
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (her face brightens)
dialog: Oh -- My dear, if you have a talent
dialog: for writing --
dialog: (she becomes suddenly
dialog: motherly)
dialog: Take my advice and develop it while
dialog: you're young. One needs all one's
dialog: time and energy for a career.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Don't you think marriage is a career
dialog: in itself?
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Oh, indeed! Emphatically! That's why
dialog: one mustn't rush into it pell-mell.
dialog: Marriage is a business -- a very
dialog: serious business. A partnership in
dialog: the strictest sense of the word. One
dialog: must prepare for it. There are so
dialog: many things to learn.
text: Jane looks at Johnny.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, Jane'll learn all of those --
dialog: after we're married.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: I hope and pray that that day will
dialog: not come for many years!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, Mother -- What do you mean --
dialog: do you mean we shouldn't --
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Emphatically not! There's no reason
dialog: for Jane to develop into a little
dialog: household drudge. Oh, I hope you
dialog: understand I have nothing against
dialog: Jane. In fact, I like her -- I like
dialog: her very much.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, I'm glad you do, Mother,
dialog: because... You remember a little
dialog: while ago you asked Jane whether
dialog: she'd come to New York to visit
dialog: relatives?
text: Jane waits breathlessly.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Well, as a matter of fact, she has
dialog: come to New York to visit relatives.

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: And you'll love them and devote your

dialog: up and leave you and you'll say to
dialog: yourself, it's all right, that's the
dialog: way it is, you've served your purpose.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, Mother, don't excite yourself

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON

dialog: strawberries.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: He gets rashes. And don't forget to
text: make him wear his raincoat in London.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: He had pneumonia once.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, Mother, that was twelve years
dialog: ago. I feel fine now.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (to Jane)
dialog: And take good care of yourself, too.
text: Mrs. Mason and Jane exchange an embarrassed embrace and a
text: kiss on the cheek.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Goodbye, Mrs. Mason.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (choking)
dialog: Take good care of him.
text: She looks at Johnny an instant as if to fix his image in her
text: mind, then throws her arms around him. Her embrace is much
text: different than the one she gave Jane. She holds onto her son
text: as if she never expected to see him again. Johnny is touched
dialog: and embarrassed.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Goodbye, Mother. Aw now, Mother --
dialog: it's only two weeks, you know.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (in a strangled voice)
dialog: I know -- Goodbye.
text: She finally lets him go.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Goodbye.
text: She gives them what she thinks is a smile, but it's really a
text: tense twisting of her lips. She starts to go, then she
dialog: remembers something.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Oh.
text: She hands the box she is carrying to Johnny.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: The heating pad. You forgot to pack
dialog: it.
text: She makes a feeble effort to wave to them and exits. Johnny
text: looks after her, perplexed and wistful.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - CLOSE (MOVING) SHOT - MRS. MASON
text: With tears streaming down her cheeks, she moves past people
text: waving farewell to those on the boat. She turns once as if
text: she means to wave too -- then turns and plods doggedly ahead.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT
text: Johnny and Jane come into the corridor glancing at doors.
text: Johnny has the heating pad under his arm. They find their
text: stateroom and go up to the door numbered 504.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Here it is.
scene_heading: INT. STATEROOM - FULL SHOT
text: Johnny and Jane enter and look around. It's the smallest
text: first class cabin on the boat with a single bed in it. The
text: only other furniture is a tiny desk and a couple of chairs.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - JOHNNY AND JANE
text: Jane tries to conceal her disappointment at the cell-like
text: size of the room, but Johnny gets it.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Ah, what do you think of it?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (obvious hypocrisy
dialog: Well, it's -- it's cozy.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: It's the only one they had left. I
dialog: think we can do better after the
text: boat sails.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, what for? I love it. It's so
dialog: intimate.
text: Jane spies a package on the luggage deposited by the desk.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: INSERT: PACKAGE
text: It's heavily wrapped in tissue paper. Jane picks it up.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JANE AND JOHNNY
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Oh that! -- that's nothing --
text: He grabs it and keeps it out of her reach.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: Is it something somebody gave you?
dialog: Oh, I know it's for me. Let me see
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (still embarrassed
dialog: Oh, no -- no, it isn't.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (as though he were
dialog: holding out on her)
dialog: It is too. Let me see it!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: But it's just something I forgot to
dialog: pack.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, what are you being so mysterious
dialog: about? Let me see it.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: It's nothing...
text: She takes the package and Johnny looks away, then watches
text: her out of the corner of his eye, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I bet it's a going away present.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - PACKAGE
text: Jane's hands tearing off the wrapping.
speaker_heading: JANE'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, Johnny, you shouldn't have done
dialog: this.
text: Her hand rips off the last piece of tissue revealing a picture
dialog: of herself.
scene_heading: CLOSE TWO SHOT - JANE AND JOHNNY
text: Jane looks at the picture, looks at Johnny, looks back at
text: the picture, enormously pleased.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, Johnny, you fool!
dialog: (throwing her arms
text: around his neck and
dialog: kissing him)
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JOHNNY - OVER JANE'S SHOULDER
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (in a weak attempt to
dialog: laugh it off)
dialog: Well, gee whizz, I couldn't leave it
dialog: in the office!
text: He looks away, reacts to something off scene.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Jane --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (her head still on
dialog: his shoulder)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You know, when I was in school I was
dialog: taught that two things can't occupy
text: the same place at the same time.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What?
text: (she draws back, looks
text: questioningly at
dialog: Johnny, follows his
dialog: gaze)
dialog: Oh.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - TINY BED
text: -- from Jane and Johnny's angle.
text: BACK TO JANE AND JOHNNY
text: They cross over to the bed, stare at it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, we'll get the steward to get
dialog: us a bigger bed.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You couldn't get a bigger bed in
dialog: here though.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, I think it's big enough.
text: She stretches out on one side of the bed and looks up at
dialog: Johnny.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Wait till you try to turn around. Is
dialog: it all right?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Sure it is.
text: Johnny lies on the other side of the bed, puts his arm around
text: Jane and they sink back on the pillow.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Let's see. That's not so bad. Why
dialog: there's oceans of room here.
text: A look of blissful content steals over them.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JOHNNY AND JANE ON BED
text: They are luxuriantly stretched out.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (dreamily)
dialog: Johnny, this is the first time in my
dialog: life I've ever been away from America.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (almost purring)
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Isn't it just beautiful?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (the complete
dialog: sophisticate)
dialog: Yeh, yeh, I guess so --
dialog: (with a far-away look)
dialog: Jane...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (meltingly)
dialog: What, Johnny?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (reminiscently and
dialog: tenderly)
dialog: Do you remember that cinder I took
dialog: out of your eye in Boston?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (positively overflowing
dialog: with gooey love)
dialog: I'll never forget it.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (self-recriminating)
dialog: Do you know that I threw it away? I
dialog: shouldn't have done that. I should
dialog: have kept that cinder -- put it ina
dialog: locket or something. If it hadn't
dialog: been for that cinder, maybe we'd
dialog: never have met...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (horrified at the
dialog: very idea!)
dialog: Don't say that, Johnny -- we had to
dialog: meet.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (grudgingly admits)
dialog: Yeh, yeh, I guess you're right.
dialog: (but still clinging
dialog: to his original
dialog: fearsome idea)
dialog: But still... if it hadn't been for
dialog: that cinder --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, Johnny -- isn't it just beautiful?
text: A hoarse blast from the steamer whistle. She edges a bit
text: closer to him and they turn to look at each other.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (with infinite
dialog: tenderness)
dialog: Bon voyage, darling.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (same manner)
dialog: Bon voyage.
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: CARTER'S VOICE
dialog: Where is stateroom 504?
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: First room to your left, sir.
text: There is a knock on the door. Johnny and Jane exchange a
text: startled glance.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Come in.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: Johnny and Jane get off the bed. The door opens and Carter
text: enters. We get a feeling he has come on a mission which he
dialog: finds exceedingly pleasant.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, hello, Carter. Nice of you to
dialog: come down.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Judge Doolittle sent me.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: He did?
text: Jane comes into the scene. Johnny introduces her to Carter.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (to Carter)
dialog: Carter, this is Miss -- Mrs. -- This
dialog: is my wife. Darling, this is Mr.
text: Carter from the office.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Happy to know you.
dialog: (to Johnny)
dialog: It's a good thing I got here in time.
dialog: You've got just ten minutes.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Ten minutes for what?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (hugely enjoys the
dialog: moment)
dialog: To get off the boat.
text: Jane reacts to this. Johnny turns to her.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: To get off the -- What're you talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Higgins against Higgins.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (a note of doom in
dialog: his voice)
dialog: What about Higgins against Higgins?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Higgins against Higgins goes on the
dialog: calendar for next week.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, no, no. That's where you're
dialog: mistaken. I got a continuance for a
dialog: whole month.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You think you did.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I did! Why didn't you ask Hornblow
dialog: about it? He gave me his word of
dialog: honor.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Well, you know Hornblow.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (frantically)
dialog: Johnny, they can't do this to you!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: No, they can't do this to me!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What does Doolittle think he is -- a
dialog: puppet?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What does he think I am -- a puppet
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Some kind of a pawn he can push around
dialog: any way he likes?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes -- push all over the place?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (to Johnny)
dialog: Is that what you want me to tell
dialog: Doolittle?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Yes!
text: Flustered, Johnny addresses Carter apologetically.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, Carter, wait a minute! Are you
dialog: sure that Higgins case is going on
dialog: next week?
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Monday morning at nine o'clock.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Will you excuse us a minute? -- Jane --
text: Carter saunters out into the corridor, leaving the door open.
text: Johnny steers Jane to other side of room.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm glad you said that, Johnny.
scene_heading: CLOSE TWO SHOT - JANE AND JOHNNY
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yeah -- yeah - Jane, look -- This
dialog: Higgins versus Higgins is a pretty
dialog: important case.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't care if it's the most
dialog: important case in the world -- it
dialog: isn't as important as our honeymoon,
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, no -- of course not, darling.
dialog: (Jane starts to wipe
dialog: his mouth with her
dialog: handkerchief)
dialog: But what's the matter?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You've got lipstick all over your
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: A lawyer is sort of like a doctor or
dialog: a soldier -- you -- you've got to
dialog: disregard your own convenience.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Convenience! You don't call this a
dialog: convenience!
text: During this scene Carter can be seen pacing back and forth
text: in the corridor.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: No, no darling -- now listen, darling,
dialog: believe me I'd tell Doolittle to
dialog: jump in the lake -- even at the risk
dialog: of losing my job, but if I win this
dialog: case -- I have a chance to get into
dialog: the firm. And -- And a firm like
dialog: this --
text: He stops suddenly as he notes the expression on her face and
text: his jaw hardens.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (continues)
dialog: But it's my honeymoon! And Doolittle
dialog: knows it's my honeymoon!
text: CAMERA PANS with him as he starts pacing back and forth. In
text: the background Carter paces in the corridor, passing the
text: open door. Johnny looks up at the moment that Carter passes,
text: giving him a significant look.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (with inflection
dialog: dimuendo)
dialog: There are just some things a man
dialog: just can't do. There are some things
dialog: aman just can't do!

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That Carter thought it was funny! He
dialog: laughed! Oh, I hate that -- that
dialog: liver-pill!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: If they ever try pulling anything
dialog: like this again, I...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: And I hate that Judge Do-nothing. I --
dialog: I wish someone would step on that
dialog: ear-thing of his.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, we still have the tickets
dialog: here...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: And I hope Higgins beats Higgins!

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, Johnny -- do you really think
dialog: so?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: It's practically up there now. What's
dialog: for dinner tonight?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Roast beef.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Roast beef! Doolittle's delight.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You know, I tried to have Annie make
dialog: Yorkshire pudding -- but she never
dialog: heard of it.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, that's all right. Between roast
dialog: beef and Higgins against Higgins how
dialog: can we lose? Yes, sir, that's going
dialog: to be all right -- my name up there
text: on the door.
text: He starts to button his shirt. Jane assists him.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, Johnny!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, didn't I win my motion for a
dialog: new trial in Higgins against Higgins?
dialog: I had a memo from Doolittle today.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, you did. What did he say?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: He said he couldn't have handled it
dialog: better himself. And when he eats
dialog: from your table tonight, he'll eat
dialog: out of my hand. And will I tell
dialog: Carter!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: And will we hop the Normandie!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: And will we go places!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: And will we do things!
dialog: (looks at Johnny)
dialog: Darling, I don't like that tie. Wear
dialog: the blue one.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (starts to take off
dialog: tie)
dialog: Holy Mackerel.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Johnny, does your name have to be
dialog: last?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, for the time being anyway. You
dialog: know what it means to a man to get
dialog: into a firm like that?
speaker_heading: JANE
text: (squirming with her
dialog: dress)
dialog: You know what it means to a firm to
dialog: get aman like you in it?
dialog: (turns her back to
dialog: him)
dialog: Here, hook me up.
text: He comes behind her to hook her.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Pretty nice neck you've got there.
dialog: (kisses her on the
dialog: back of the neck)
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: As nice as Eunice Doolittle's?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What do I know about Eunice
dialog: Doolittle's neck? I never even noticed
dialog: she had one.
dialog: (quickly changes the
dialog: subject which is a
dialog: slightly dangerous
dialog: one -- looks at his
dialog: wrist watch)
dialog: Hey, do you know what time it is?
dialog: Get dressed, will you?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I am dressed.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (gets into his coat)
dialog: Come on then!

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - GROUP IN LIVING ROOM
text: Judge Doolittle standing in a group including Mrs. Mason,

text: come into the scene.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (fearfully)
dialog: Good evening, Judge. I've got great
dialog: news for you tonight, Judge. We're
dialog: having roast beef. Roast beef for
dialog: dinner, yeah.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
text: Her face grim, a large serving platter in her arms. CAMERA
text: DRAWS BACK and we see she is serving Doolittle, squeezing up
text: against him so that he is in a very awkward position. An
text: appalling silence hangs over the table. From the condition
text: of the various plates, we can see it is Annie's second time
text: around. Doolittle manages to spear a slice. He puts it on
text: his plate and is about to reach for another when he finds
text: that Annie has moved on to Jane. A little bewildered,
text: Doolittle places the serving fork and spoon on the edge of
text: the platter. He has to reach across Jane to do this.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP - EUNICE
text: With one prong of her fork she spears the very end of a stalk
text: of asparagus and pops it into her mouth -- with an expressive
dialog: look at Carter, as if to say: whatever made me come here
dialog: tonight?
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - CARTER
text: He shrugs, sticks his tongue against his cheek, looks
text: ceilingward and makes cabalistic marks on the tablecloth
text: with the end of his knife.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - MRS. MASON
text: She ignores her food and beats with her finger tips on the
text: edge of the table. She seems to be nursing some secret
text: grievance and stewing about it.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JOHNNY
text: He saws away at a piece of meat that is making a bum out of
text: his knife. He gives up and leans forward with a gesture of
text: his hand as if he is about to make a desperate effort to
text: renew the conversation -- but the effort is abortive. He
text: finds he has nothing to say.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JANE AND DOOLITTLE
text: She turns to Doolittle.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (rather loudly, in
dialog: deference to
dialog: Doolittle's deafness)
dialog: Would you care for some more wine,
dialog: Judge Doolittle?
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Yes. Thank you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (to Annie, at other
dialog: end of table)
dialog: Annie -- more wine for Judge
dialog: Doolittle.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: There ain't any more.
text: Doolittle decides to start on his salad. He can't find a
text: salad fork. With a crucified expression, he uses his meat
text: fork. Annie starts toward the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (sharply)
text: A salad fork for Judge Doolittle,
dialog: Annie!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: (as she exits into
dialog: kitchen)
dialog: I put one there.
text: The swinging door closes behind her.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (desperately tries to
dialog: change the subject)
dialog: Funniest thing happened to me the
dialog: other day, Judge Doolittle -- I ran
dialog: across the year book of my husband's
dialog: class at college, and in the class
dialog: prophecy he was picked out as the
dialog: one most likely to succeed.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (louder)
dialog: The other day I ran across the year
dialog: book of my husband's class at college,
dialog: and in the class prophecy --
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Oh, yes, yes -- yes.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Higgins against Higgins was quite an
dialog: important case, wasn't it, Judge
dialog: Doolittle?
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: We like to think all our cases are
dialog: important. The little client of today
dialog: may be the big client of tomorrow.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - CARTER
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Oh, you're so right, Judge.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - DOOLITTLE AND JANE
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: For instance, we got a client the
dialog: other day...
speaker_heading: FULL SHOT
text: Annie has been serving the dessert. She sets a plate of almost
text: liquid ice cream before the Judge. He stares at it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh dear --
dialog: (at the breaking point,
dialog: but trying desperately
dialog: to control herself)
dialog: What happened to your ice cream,
dialog: Annie?
text: Annie continues serving the ice cream.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I told you to have the ice box fixed.
text: She puts a piece of paper alongside Jane's plate. Jane looks
text: at the note.
scene_heading: INSERT - THE NOTE
dialog: It reads:
dialog: "I've got to leave. I want my pay. $12.00."
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE TABLE
text: Annie is standing near Jane. Jane hands her the note and
text: whispers to her.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (whispering to Annie)
dialog: Annie, give this note to Mr. Mason.
text: Annie departs with note.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP - JANE
text: She looks across the table and tries to mouth the import of
text: Annie's message to Johnny.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JOHNNY
text: He mouths back inquiries. He can't make out what Jane is
text: trying to convey.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - CARTER
text: Looking from Jane to Johnny, wondering what's going on.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: Jane gives up and turns to Doolittle.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Johnny
dialog: Is it true, Judge Doolittle, something
dialog: new is going to happen in the firm
dialog: this week?
dialog: by this time has gotten the significance of the note.
text: He rises and starts out.
dialog: Johnny
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (to Doolittle)
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Excuse me, please?
text: exits. Doolittle continues.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Oh yes -- we're going to have a blood
dialog: transfusion... I'm only speaking
dialog: metaphorically of course. What I
dialog: mean is we're getting some new blood
dialog: into the firm -- appointing a junior
dialog: partner.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh!
text: She looks frantically toward the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You couldn't stay and serve the
dialog: coffee, could you Annie?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Here's seven dollars -- and I'll
dialog: send you --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (adamant -- in a loud
dialog: voice)
dialog: I want my twelve dollars now!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (whispering and trying
dialog: to shush her)
dialog: All right, Annie -- all right. I'll
dialog: get it for you. I'll get it -- maybe.
text: Turns to go out.
scene_heading: MED SHOT - DINING ROOM
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: That's how to keep an old firm young.
dialog: I've been doing this every five years
dialog: and it's quite a job to pick the
dialog: right man.
text: Johnny comes out of the kitchen. Doolittle frowns at the
dialog: interruption.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Johnny --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
text: (as he passes the
dialog: table)
dialog: Excuse me --
dialog: (he proceeds to the
dialog: living room)
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (answering Doolittle)
dialog: I shouldn't think so. Surely it's a
dialog: question of merit --
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE SHOT - JOHNNY
text: He rummages through Jane's bureau drawer -- stockings and
text: handkerchiefs falling out, etc... finds her purse, takes out
text: a small roll of bills, closes the purse, restores it to its
dialog: place.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - DINING ROOM
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: As a rule I always trust my own
dialog: judgment, but when it comes to picking
dialog: men --
text: Johnny enters from the living room.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Johnny --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Excuse me --
text: He exits again into the kitchen.
text: Doolittle is more annoyed than ever at the continuous
dialog: interruptions.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (continues)
dialog: ...I think there's nothing like a
dialog: woman's intuition.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Oh, you're so right, Judge.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Of course, Eunice doesn't know much
dialog: about law -- but she's traveled all
dialog: over the world and she does know
dialog: people. Five years ago it was at her
dialog: suggestion that I took Mr. Hutch
dialog: into the firm. It worked out so
dialog: well...
text: Johnny enters from the kitchen and takes his place at the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I beg your pardon -- I'm very sorry...
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (continues his speech)
dialog: ...that this year I have again
dialog: consulted my daughter. And now a new

dialog: (Johnny and Jane listen
dialog: eagerly)
dialog: Beginning next Monday, the name of

speaker_heading: DOOLITTLE'S VOICE

dialog: at Johnny.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JOHNNY
text: Trying to rise to the occasion, he stands...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, Carter -- Congratulations!
dialog: It's wonderful. I always knew you
dialog: had it in you... I'd like to propose
dialog: a toast to the new partner -- only --
dialog: we -- seem to have run out of --
dialog: wine. There isn't any more wine.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (tremulously)
dialog: May I have some paper and an envelope,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Certainly.
text: She hands Jane a sheet of office stationery and an envelope.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thank you.
text: CAMERA PANS Jane over to a little writing desk. She sits
text: down, reaches for the pen and draws a large heart in the
text: center of the sheet. In her excitement she begins to hum
text: "Columbia, The Gem of the Ocean" as she starts to write a
text: note within the heart.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Would you like a stamp?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No thank you.

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - CLOSE UP - JOHNNY

speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: Last row of seats in courtroom. Jane is seated there. Johnny

scene_heading: INSERT: THE LETTER
text: Instead of one heart-shaped enclosure, there are two joined

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Old? What do you mean, old?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I mean... he looks as though he were
dialog: six months old -- or a year -- at
dialog: least.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, Johnny, you're silly... but don't
dialog: you think he's just beautiful?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (dodging)
dialog: I hope he grows up to look like you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How can he? He has all your features.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I don't see how you can tell that by
text: looking at that face.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP - BABY
dialog: Who looks like no one on earth.
speaker_heading: JANE'S VOICE
dialog: Just look at the way his eyes
dialog: crinkle... Just the way yours do
dialog: when you're happy.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
text: He doesn't look happy. He looks kind
dialog: of bored.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, you'd be bored too, if you'd
dialog: been through what he has... But don't
dialog: you think he's just beautiful?
text: Johnny has put out his hand. The baby has gripped his finger.

text: OPEN on CLOSE SHOT BABY in portable canvas babies' bath set

speaker_heading: JOHNNY'S VOICE
dialog: Well, fella, how do you like your
dialog: first bath?
text: CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal Jane, in house gown giving the
text: baby its first bath at home. Johnny, in shirt sleeves, is
text: sitting on the edge of the tub, fascinated. Mrs. Mason stands
text: alongside watching and coaching. The advent of the baby has
text: materially changed the appearance of the bathroom. A
text: clothesline is rigged across the room and on it hang three
text: diapers held by clothespins.
text: A baby's scale sets on the closed seat of the toilet, or on
text: a clothes hamper or etc. Jane handles the baby very gingerly.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Be sure you soap his head thoroughly.
dialog: It prevents cradle-cap.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (still pleasantly)
dialog: Yes, Mother. I know.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (more baby talk to
dialog: baby)
dialog: Ittie Johnny doesn't want nasty old
dialog: cradle-cap, does oo?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Look at those shoulders! Can I do
dialog: something Jane?
dialog: (pleadingly)
dialog: Please!
text: He reaches for baby as Jane lifts him out of the water. This
text: movement makes Jane almost let it slip through her hands and
text: she exclaims in fright:
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (panicky)
dialog: Now look what you've done! I almost
dialog: dropped him! Do move over, Johnny --
dialog: please!
text: Her back to CAMERA, she holds the baby in her arms as she
text: pulls over the canvas top of the tub and lays the baby on
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: If you'd let me show you how --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (not quite so
dialog: pleasantly)
dialog: I know how. They showed me at the
dialog: hospital.
dialog: (she is now drying
text: the baby, her back
speaker_heading: still to CAMERA)
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: You don't rub the baby dry. You just
text: pat him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (beginning to wear
dialog: thin)
dialog: I am patting him.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
text: He looks red. Maybe the water was
dialog: too hot.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: No, Mother. It was just right. I
dialog: tested it.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (to baby in baby talk)
dialog: Was its 'ittle water too hot for
dialog: ittie Johnny?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (she turns to Johnny)
dialog: Johnny, will you hand me his shirt?
text: Johnny reaches for the wrong garment.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Not that one! This one.
text: She gets the shirt, starts to put it on.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (admiringly)
dialog: Look at the chest on him!
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: Can't I help?
text: Neither woman pays any attention to him.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Be careful of his little head, my
dialog: dear.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (still pleasantly)
dialog: I will, Mother. Johnny, you'd better
dialog: go in the kitchen and warm his milk.
text: PAN WITH JOHNNY as he starts out of the room. He almost
text: collides with the clothesline and has to stoop in order to
text: get by it; almost knocks over the scales as he exits.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (calling to Johnny
dialog: Not too hot, John!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JANE
text: The baby is now all dressed for the night, and Jane has him

dialog: relief)
dialog: He's bathed!
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - AT CRIB
text: Mrs. Mason stands over the crib. Jane is wearily stretched
text: out in a chair near the crib, her arms and legs stretched in
text: fatigue, her eyes closed: the mother just back from the
text: hospital. The baby is crying lustily. They look harassed.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
text: A touch of colic.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (without opening her
dialog: eyes -- wearily)
dialog: No, Mother, he's just hungry.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (with maddening
dialog: tolerance of her
dialog: daughter-in-law's
dialog: stupidity)
dialog: I'm sorry, my dear, but it's colic...
text: He's been crying for five minutes.
text: Jane closes her eyes and controls herself with effort.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (sitting up a little,
dialog: calling impatiently)
dialog: Johnny! Where's that bottle!
text: Johnny comes in from kitchen, triumphantly carrying the baby's
dialog: bottle.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (goes toward the crib)
dialog: Here, fella -- the feed bag!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JOHNNY AT CRIB
text: The baby still squawling -- Johnny trying to put the bottle
text: into its hands.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - BABY
text: Baby's hands fighting off bottle, as he continues to bawl.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT-JOHNNY
text: Jane comes into scene. She yanks the bottle from Johnny.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: They don't eat with their hands, you
dialog: dope!
text: She rolls up her sleeve and tests the temperature of the
text: milk by spilling a few drops on her forearm, looking at Johnny
text: in a superior manner and shaking her head. She lowers the
text: bottle toward the crib.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP - BABY
text: As Jane forces the bottle into its mouth. His squawling ceases
text: instantly and he sucks the nipple with vehement appreciation.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: Again Jane goes to chair and sinks down wearily. The doorbell
text: rings. Johnny exits to answer it. Jane looks at the contented
text: baby, then speaks to Mrs. Mason:
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (lies back in her
dialog: chair, closes her
dialog: eyes)
dialog: You see Mother, he was hungry.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: If he were fed on time he wouldn't
dialog: cry.
speaker_heading: JANE
text: (Her eyes still closed,
text: her hands tighten on
dialog: the arm of the chair)
dialog: As soon as we're organized...
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (interrupting)
text: Too bad he has to be fed on a bottle.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (sighs -- grimly)
dialog: I haven't heard the baby complain
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: John never saw a bottle till he was
dialog: six months old.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP - JANE
text: Controlling herself, speaks as inaudibly as possible --
dialog: practically to herself:
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (as she speaks she
text: clenches her hands
dialog: on the arms of the
dialog: chair)
dialog: I won't say anything. I won't say
dialog: anything. I won't say anything...
scene_heading: MRS. MASON'S VOICE
dialog: What's that, my dear?
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Johnny comes in -- carrying a flat, small package already
text: half unwrapped.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What do you think? It's a present
dialog: from old Granite Puss...
text: He sits down beside Jane, starts unwrapping the package.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'll bet it's a summons.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: No -- it's a bank book.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
text: Johnny's hands finishing opening package. It contains a bank
text: book showing that an account has been opened in the name of
text: John H. Mason, Jr, with an opening deposit of $10.00 -- and
text: accompanying it is Judge Doolittle's business card.
text: Johnny's hand turns the card over. On it is handwritten:
dialog: "A penny earned is a penny saved."
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - GROUP
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: He's deposited Ten Dollars.
dialog: (he hands Jane the
dialog: open bank book.)
text: Mrs. Mason glances over Jane's shoulder.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Say -- that's a lot of money for the
dialog: little guy.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I hope it doesn't plunge Doolittle
dialog: into bankruptcy.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: After that hospital bill he's got
dialog: more cash in the bank than I have.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (very superior)
dialog: I think it's very considerate of
dialog: Judge Doolittle to think about the
dialog: baby's future.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm not worried about his future --
dialog: It's the present that bothers me...
dialog: Where are we going to put him?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Why can't he stay in our room?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You know he kept you awake last night.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (with demure over-
dialog: sweetness)
dialog: You should have taken that into
dialog: consideration, my dear, before you
dialog: rented this apartment.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (too tired to argue)
dialog: I know. I should have.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: If my own room weren't so small --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (sweetly, forgetting
dialog: and forgiving what
dialog: she's been through)
dialog: Oh, I wouldn't think of it, dear.

speaker_heading: JANE'S VOICE
dialog: That's too far from the bedroom.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY'S VOICE
dialog: Well, in the dining room, then.
speaker_heading: JANE'S VOICE
dialog: It's too near the kitchen -- but I
dialog: suppose we'll have to.
text: Hilda shows that she doesn't relish the idea of the baby
text: being near the kitchen. She coughs to attract attention.
speaker_heading: HILDA
dialog: Mrs. --
speaker_heading: JANE'S VOICE
dialog: Yes, Hilda?
speaker_heading: HILDA
dialog: (Swedish accent)
dialog: Could I please see you a minute?
text: Jane comes into the Shot.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What is it, Hilda?
speaker_heading: HILDA
dialog: Your mother-in-law hired me when you
dialog: was away -- but she didn't say why
dialog: you was away --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (tight-lipped)
dialog: You mean you don't approve of my
dialog: having a baby?
speaker_heading: HILDA
dialog: That's your business. You can have
dialog: as many babies as you like.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: Thank you. That's big of you.
speaker_heading: HILDA
dialog: But my business is cooking. You get

text: She turns and starts to exit. Jane calls after her, almost
dialog: tearfully:
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You're --
dialog: (with a wail)
dialog: you're fired!
text: Hilda pays no attention to this parting sally but continues

speaker_heading: JOHNNY'S VOICE

speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - CRIB

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: As soon as the lease is up we'll get

dialog: Look! Mother! Jane! Look -- the baby!

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - JANE AND JOHNNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The hall is lighted only by a dim light from the living room.
text: The sound of the clock striking continues. The sound of a
text: key turning in the lock, the door opens, and Johnny enters.
text: He is in dinner clothes, black overcoat, and scarf. He seems
text: unusually dejected. He softly closes the door behind him and
text: starts on tiptoes toward the bedroom, CAMERA TRUCKING WITH
text: HIM. Attracted by the light from the living room, he stops
text: in the doorway and looks in at:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - JANE ON DIVAN
text: (from his angle) Jane, in a warm bathrobe, is curled up
text: asleep. On the floor by the divan is an open book, face up.
text: A lamp on a nearby table is the only light in the room.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JOHNNY
text: He tiptoes into the room, taking off his hat as he crosses
text: and sits down on the floor near the divan, looks at Jane a
text: moment, moody and licked. Then he notices the open book on
text: the floor. He puts his elbows on his knees, cups his chin
text: and stares at the open book.
speaker_heading: INSERT: BOOK
text: It is a year book of Johnny's college, open at the page

text: Jane stirs and opens her eyes, sees Johnny.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JOHNNY

speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Who was there?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, just the same old crowd, only
dialog: ten years older.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Who spoke, Johnny?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Ed O'Malley made quite a speech --
dialog: all about how he bought that seat on
dialog: the stock exchange. And then Joe
dialog: Kendall -- just got back from opening
dialog: up a London office --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Did you make a speech?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You know -- the things you have to
text: say at a reunion. Nothing much.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (insists)
dialog: What did you say, Johnny?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, my speech was pretty short.
dialog: What would I have to say?
dialog: (bitterly -- Johnny
dialog: sees book on the

dialog: The man most likely to succeed.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, I think you have and I bet
dialog: your speech was swell.
dialog: (they kiss)
dialog: Did you tell them that funny story
dialog: you told me yesterday?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: No -- no, I didn't think of it. All
dialog: I could think of was my achievements --
dialog: What I've accomplished and how far
dialog: I've gone. I suppose I should have
dialog: told them how I used your money --
dialog: all of it -- to buy the furniture
dialog: for this apartment.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Now, that's silly. Your money -- my
dialog: money -- what's the difference? It
dialog: wasn't much anyway.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I should have told them how the baby
dialog: has to sleep in the dining room --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, what of it? And it's only
dialog: temporary -- till we get a new
dialog: apartment --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (over Jane's dialogue)
dialog: -- because I can't afford to get you
dialog: a decent place to live --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Stop it! Don't say those things!
dialog: Sometimes I get so mad at you I can't
dialog: see straight.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Sometimes I get so mad at myself I
dialog: can't see at all!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know what happened -- the dinner
dialog: disagreed with you. What did you
dialog: have?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I don't know -- I didn't eat any of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Now I know what's wrong -- you're
dialog: hungry!

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Johnny and Jane enter. Jane proceeds to the ice box, opens
text: it and starts to pry into it, taking things out.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Now let's see. Here's some cheese
dialog: you like. And a whole cold chicken
dialog: staring us right in the face. Which?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Chicken.
text: Jane takes the platter and puts it on the kitchen table.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: The trouble with you is you let people
dialog: step on you! You do all the work in
dialog: that office... Coffee?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: No. Milk.
text: Jane takes milk from the ice box and sets it on the table.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You've forgotten more about law than
dialog: Carter'll ever know. How do you expect
dialog: people to recognize your value if
dialog: you don't recognize it yourself?...
dialog: White or rye?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Rye.
text: She goes to bread box -- rummages in it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: They couldn't get along without you
dialog: for one minute -- and you know it!
dialog: Everybody knows it!
text: She gets bread knife and starts to butter bread.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (eats a leg of chicken)
dialog: Everybody but Doolittle.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He knows it too! But he takes
dialog: advantage of you. I told you when he
dialog: promoted Carter over your head that
dialog: you should have quit -- walk right
dialog: out on him!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Now, Jane, how could I? What about --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know -- your mother and I. I wish
dialog: you'd forget about us.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: If I lost my job --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: But you wouldn't! They'd never let
dialog: you go! You're far too valuable! If
dialog: you left, Doolittle would crawl to
dialog: you on his hands and knees and beg
dialog: you to come back.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (wry laugh)
dialog: On his hands and knees! You don't
dialog: know Doolittle.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know you! All you've got to do is
dialog: speak up -- stand right up to
dialog: Doolittle! Don't ask for your rights --
dialog: demand them!
text: He reaches for her hand and looks at the simple wedding band
text: on one finger.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Remember the day in Boston when I
dialog: got you this ring -- I promised to
dialog: get you a better one later?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't want a better one later.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You liked the platinum one with the
dialog: diamonds.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That can wait.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: And the mink coat can wait too, I
dialog: suppose. Probably in about three
dialog: hundred years I can afford to buy
dialog: you one.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What are you -- a man or a mouse?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: A mouse!
text: Jane grabs the kitchen knife and waves it in front of Johnny
dialog: as she talks:
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: John Mason, you know what's the matter
dialog: with you? You're too modest. You
dialog: don't appreciate yourself... I do
dialog: want that platinum ring! And I want
text: a fur coat -- not the mink -- but a
dialog: fur coat! And I want a honeymoon on
dialog: the Normandie! And I want an apartment
dialog: that's big enough for your mother
dialog: and the baby -- so the baby wouldn't
dialog: have to sleep in the dining room!
dialog: You can get them for me! You can get
dialog: everything I want -- everything that's
dialog: coming to me! But first you've got
dialog: to get what's coming to you!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: If I only knew how to go about it --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It's easy.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You think it's easy.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You just walk right into the office
dialog: and you say --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Jane, you don't walk into Judge
text: Doolittle's office. He sends for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, this time you walk in. You go
dialog: right up to him and you say: "Judge
dialog: Doolittle, there's something I've
dialog: got to say to you right now."
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You can't talk to him like that
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Have you ever tried?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Now Jane, you don't understand. If I
dialog: barged in there like that he'd --
dialog: he'd --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He'd say -- "What is it Mason? Sit
dialog: down."
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: He never asked me to sit down in his
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well then stand up. But don't let
dialog: him interrupt you. Speak your piece.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yeah -- well now that -- speak your
dialog: piece. It's easy to do here in the
dialog: kitchen. You get downtown...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, downtown or uptown, what
dialog: difference does it make? You're not
dialog: asking a favor of him. You're
dialog: demanding your rights. He'll listen.
dialog: Make him listen.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: All right -- okay -- all right --
dialog: what'll I say?
text: Jane has been gathering up the foodstuffs. She shoves what's
text: left of the chicken into the ice box, turns out the light
text: and they start out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You'll say --
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM
text: Jane and Johnny enter and start through to entry hall.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: "Judge Doolittle, I've been working
dialog: for you now for five years and I've
dialog: given you everything that's in me --
dialog: every ounce."
text: They stop at the crib, look down at the sleeping baby. During
text: the rest of the scene Jane changes the baby's diaper as they
text: talk. Johnny is still chewing on the leg of chicken.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, all right -- what'll he say?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: There's no doubt about it, Mason.
dialog: I've never questioned your ability
dialog: or your loyalty --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: And I'll say --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Judge Doolittle -- what're you going
dialog: to do about it?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I hate to think what he'll say!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He'll say: Mason, what do you expect
dialog: me to do? And you'll say: The right
dialog: thing, Judge Doolittle... I want
dialog: more money and I want to be taken
dialog: into the firm! And he'll say:
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: He'll say plenty!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No matter what he'll say -- you'll
dialog: say:
text: Jane has finished changing the baby. With a last fond look,

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Jane and Johnny enter. Jane still talking.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (speaking as if she
dialog: were addressing Judge
dialog: Doolittle in person)
dialog: Judge Doolittle, I either get a raise
dialog: and a junior partnership or else --
dialog: (Johnny waits
dialog: breathlessly)
dialog: Or else you can accept my resignation,
dialog: effective immediately.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (with grim
dialog: determination)
dialog: Effective immediately. That's all
dialog: right, Jane. That's a good idea. I'm

dialog: Let's start at the beginning, Jane.
dialog: I'll walk into his office and I'll
dialog: say --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Judge Doolittle, there's something
dialog: I've got to say to you right now!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
text: (waving his shoe at
dialog: his reflection in
dialog: the mirror)
dialog: Judge Doolittle, there's something
dialog: I've got to say to you right now!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Either I get a raise and a junior
dialog: partnership --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Either I get a raise and a junior
dialog: partnership --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Or you can accept my resignation --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Or you can accept my resignation --
dialog: (without Jane's cue)
text: Effective immediately.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (tenderly and proud)
dialog: Effective immediately!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Not bad.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE SHOT
text: An alarm clock on the night table next to Johnny's bed. It
text: registers shortly before three a.m. CAMERA PANS over to Jane.
text: She is asleep. She wakes suddenly and looks over toward
text: Johnny's pillow, sees that it's empty, then attracted by a
text: sound, looks toward window.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - AT WINDOW
text: Silhouetted in the moonlight is a figure in pajamas. It is
text: Johnny, gesticulating fiercely, rehearsing in a sibilant
dialog: whisper.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I've been working in this office for
dialog: the last five years and there's
dialog: something I want to tell you right
dialog: now -- Either I get a raise anda
dialog: junior partnership -- Or else...
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP - JANE
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (repeats, tenderly)
dialog: Or else --

dialog: her eyes)
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. JOHNNY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NEXT DAY
text: OPEN on CLOSE SHOT pieces of scratch paper littering Johnny's
text: glass-topped desk, covered with scribbled designs and
text: â€œdoodlings." A hand comes into Shot and draws four large
text: exclamation points on one of the pieces of paper.
text: (Under the glass top are many snapshots of Jane and the baby
dialog: in various poses.)
text: CAMERA DRAWS BACK, and we reveal that it is Johnny who has
text: been sitting at his desk scribbling. He throws his pencil
text: down and rises; starts to pace up and down the room nervously.
text: He mumbles to himself, rehearsing the speech he is going to
dialog: make to Judge Doolittle:
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (pacing)
dialog: +..a raise and a junior partnership --
dialog: or else...
text: The fusty old bookkeeper pokes his head in the door and Johnny
text: looks up, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: BOOKKEEPER
dialog: (motioning)
text: Judge Doolittle is in.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Okay!
text: The bookkeeper exits. Johnny starts on another quick mumbled
text: rehearsal, pacing again.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (mumbling, then)
dialog: -- Or else you can accept my
dialog: resignation -- effective immediately.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (appearing in doorway)
dialog: What is it, a jury case?
text: Johnny whirls, guiltily and embarrassed.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Now, never mind. I'm thinking.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (holds out papers to
dialog: Johnny)
dialog: Here are the papers in City against
dialog: Consolidated.
text: Johnny takes the papers without answering.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I want you to drop over to
dialog: Consolidated and see their
dialog: accountants.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Okay.
text: Carter goes down the corridor, just missing a collision with
text: the office boy who pops his head in at Johnny's door.
speaker_heading: OFFICE BOY
dialog: (to Johnny)
dialog: Pssst!
dialog: (imitates Doolittle
dialog: by flipping back his
dialog: coat and motions
dialog: back toward
dialog: Doolittle's office
dialog: with his thumb)
dialog: He just got in.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Okay -- okay.
text: As he pops out again, Johnny looks haggard and gulps. He
text: stands motionless a moment, then in frantic hurry starts to
text: straighten his tie. He lays the papers on his desk, walks
text: quickly to the door, and puts his hand on the knob.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOLITTLE'S DOOR
text: Johnny stands there, gets a grip on himself and knocks
text: timidly. Of course there is no response. Doolittle couldn't
text: possibly have heard the knock. He knocks again, just as
text: softly, and hearing no answer, turns and is about to go back
text: to his office when Doolittle's voice comes through the door.
speaker_heading: DOOLITTLE'S VOICE
dialog: (bellows)
dialog: Come in!
scene_heading: INT. DOOLITTLE'S OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - AT DESK
text: Doolittle is frowning over some papers in his hand. Johnny
text: stalks into the Shot, blurts out his rehearsed speech.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Judge Doolittle, there's something
dialog: I've got to say to you right now --
text: Doolittle is intent on the Income Tax statement. Johnny coughs
dialog: gently.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Judge Doolittle --
dialog: (Doolittle looks up)
dialog: I've been working in this office --
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Oh, it's you!
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: You're just the one I wanted to see.
dialog: (indicates a chair by
dialog: his side)
dialog: Sit down.
text: Johnny, surprised at the unexpected invitation, sits on the
text: edge of the chair and waits. Doolittle leans back in his
text: swivel chair, adjusts his glasses and rocks slowly, fixing a
text: basilisk gaze on Johnny.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Mason --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes, sir?
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: You've been doing mighty good work
dialog: lately.
text: Johnny smiles. The old man is actually going to make it easy
dialog: for him!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Johnny
dialog: Johnny
dialog: Johnny
dialog: Thank you, Judge.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: You've been capable, dependable and
dialog: loyal -- right from the start!
text: is so tickled he actually crosses his legs.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
text: (his chest comes out
dialog: a little)
dialog: That's mighty nice of you, Judge!
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: But, Mason -- these are extraordinary
dialog: times -- For all of us!
text: uncrosses his legs.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Some of our biggest clients are
dialog: affected. They all complain they're
dialog: practically working for the
dialog: Government.
text: is rigid in his chair again.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Most of them claim it'll be all they
dialog: can do to stay in business till the
dialog: next election. So they're cutting
dialog: expenses right and left -- and we're
dialog: the first to feel it. Naturally we
dialog: have to do something about it.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (with sinking heart)
dialog: Naturally.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (flips open his coat)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (repeats, louder)
dialog: Naturally!
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: I don't want to cut down the personnel
dialog: of my staff if I can possibly help
dialog: it. -- Wouldn't be constructive. So
dialog: the only way out -- as I can see it --
dialog: is to tighten our belts. I'm asking
dialog: everyone to take a twenty-five percent
dialog: cut. I'm starting by taking a
dialog: substantial cut in my own personal
dialog: drawing account. It's a sacrifice,
dialog: but it hits all of us. These are
dialog: days of sacrifice!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I know, Judge, but I --
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: These are times when we all have to
dialog: put our shoulders to the wheel -- if
dialog: we're to survive!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yes, sir, our shoulders to the wheel --
dialog: Only I --
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: I'm glad you understand, Mason -- I
dialog: appreciate your cooperation.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (miserably)
dialog: Thank you, sir.
text: Doolittle's phone rings.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (reaches for phone)
dialog: Hello --
dialog: (glances up at Johnny)
dialog: Excuse me, Mason.
text: Johnny rises and starts out. We hear Doolittle continuing
dialog: into telephone:
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Hello, Commissioner. -- You know
dialog: that little piece of property on
dialog: Park Avenue? Well -- if the price is
dialog: right --
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE DOOLITTLE'S OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - AT
speaker_heading: DOOR
text: Johnny comes out, his face a mask of doom as he starts back
text: to his office.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN: (SAME NIGHT)
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR
text: Johnny enters. We can see at once that our hero has sought
text: comfort and slight consolation in the grape. He has had a
dialog: few drinks and his courage has obviously been falsely
text: bolstered by the liquor. He is slightly tight but in no sense
text: drunk. He glares defiantly ahead, then slams the door
text: violently shut.
scene_heading: INT. MRS. MASON'S BEDROOM - CLOSE SHOT AT BED
text: The slamming of the door awakes Mrs. Mason and she sits
text: quickly up as if she were goosed.
scene_heading: TRUCKING SHOT - JOHNNY
text: Making as much noise as possible, Johnny goes into the living
text: room, turns on the switch which lights the central lighting
text: fixture, and goes from lamp to lamp turning them all on.
text: Then he stomps into the dining room, still making as much
text: noise as possible, turns on all the dining room lights, and
text: stomps on out to the kitchen.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - AT CRIB IN DINING ROOM
text: The baby wakes up and lets out a yelp.
scene_heading: INT. JANE'S BEDROOM
text: Jane hears the baby cry and gets out of bed, exiting toward
dialog: dining room.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Johnny opens the ice box, brings out a bottle of milk and
text: starts pouring it into a glass. The bottle falls to the floor
text: with a crash. The door opens a crack and Lily sticks her
dialog: head out.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Did you want something, Mister Mason?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: No thank you, Lily.
text: Lily's head disappears.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - AT CRIB
text: Jane quiets the baby. In a minute Johnny comes out of the
text: kitchen, not bothering to turn out the lights after him. His
text: hat and coat are still on. His overcoat swings open and we
text: see his suit and coat splattered with milk. He looks at Jane
text: defiantly.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (belligerent)
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (still bending over
dialog: the crib -- very
dialog: casually)
dialog: Good morning, Johnny.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (explosively)
dialog: Good morning.

dialog: bedroom, Jane
dialog: following)
scene_heading: MOVING SHOT - JANE AND JOHNNY - EN ROUTE TO BEDROOM
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I feel fine!
text: (he flings his hat
dialog: across the room)
text: They go into the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: As they enter, Johnny takes off both his overcoat and his
text: suit coat at the same time and lets them slip to the floor.
text: Jane goes to the mirror, casually fixes her hair.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What time is it?
text: Johnny flings down his vest.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (in a mounting voice --
dialog: each hour louder)
dialog: Three o'clock! Four o'clock! Five
dialog: o'clock! High noon!
dialog: (takes off his tie
dialog: and throws it down)
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (very quietly against
dialog: his obviously
dialog: synthetic rage)
dialog: It's just two, isn't it?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: If you know the time why do you ask
dialog: me? What difference does it make
dialog: what time it is?
dialog: (starts to take off
dialog: his shirt)
dialog: I feel fine.
text: He flings his shirt to the floor and exits to bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Johnny enters -- bumps into the line of diapers, angrily
text: rips down the cord and the diapers fall to the floor.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JANE IN BEDROOM
text: Now the sound of running water from the bathroom. Jane looks
text: toward the bathroom with lowered lids, shakes her head,
dialog: thinking what to do.
text: Johnny's pants come flying into the room. Jane thinks a
text: moment, then exits toward entry hall.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT
text: Jane goes to light switch, puts out central chandelier light,
text: then goes from lamp to lamp, putting out all the lights Johnny
dialog: lit.
scene_heading: INT. MRS. MASON'S BEDROOM - CLOSE UP - MRS. MASON
text: Her light is now on. She is sitting up in bed listening with
text: an expression of rage on her face. Finally she turns the
text: light out viciously and sinks back into bed to sleep.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - CLOSE SHOT - JOHNNY
text: Now in pajamas at sink. He is filling a glass with mouth
text: wash. He starts to gargle -- he gargles very loudly.
scene_heading: INT. JOHNNY & JANE'S BEDROOM - MEDIUM SHOT
text: Jane enters and starts to pick up Johnny's clothes. Johnny's
text: loud gargling comes from the bathroom. Jane neatly folds all
text: Johnny's clothes and starts to hang them up in clothes closet
text: as Johnny enters and goes directly to bed, pulling blankets
text: over him. We do not see Johnny's feet in this scene.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JANE AT CLOSET
text: She carefully hangs up Johnny's clothes.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Feel better now?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - AT BED
text: Johnny curled up under blankets.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I feel fine!
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JANE AT CLOTHES CLOSET
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Are you comfortable?
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JOHNNY IN BED
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Plenty comfortable.
speaker_heading: JANE'S VOICE
dialog: Are you sure you're comfortable?
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - JANE AT CLOSET
text: She finishes hanging up Johnny's things.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY'S VOICE
dialog: Certainly I'm sure I'm comfortable!
text: Jane looks down at the figure curled up under the blankets.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (softly -- politely)
dialog: Don't you think you'd be more
dialog: comfortable if you took off your
dialog: shoes?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JOHNNY
text: Johnny sits upright -- flings the blankets off and stares at
text: his feet. He has forgotten to take off his shoes. He swings
text: over and sits on the edge of the bed, bending down to take
text: off his shoes. His fumbling fingers have trouble with the
text: shoe laces. Jane enters.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: (she gets down on her
dialog: knees)
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I don't need any help! I feel fine!
text: But he lets her take off his shoes anyway. He suddenly
text: explodes into an indignant tirade against nothing in
dialog: particular.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
text: (waving his arms as
text: Jane takes off his
dialog: shoes)
dialog: What time is it? Am I comfortable?
dialog: How do I feel? You'd think I committed
dialog: some sort of crime! You'd think I
dialog: was on the witness stand! A man comes
dialog: home looking for a little peace and
dialog: quiet, and what happens? Blah-blah-
dialog: blah! Why didn't I call you back?
dialog: Why didn't I come home for supper? A
dialog: million questions just because a man --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (without looking up,
dialog: speaks matter-of-
dialog: factly)
dialog: I ran into Judge Doolittle this
dialog: afternoon -- after you saw him.
text: There is a silence. She looks up to find Johnny staring at
text: her. His face is such a mask of misery she can hardly stand
text: it. She rises from her kneeling position, sits on the edge
text: of the bed alongside of him, takes him in her arms and hugs
text: him tightly.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (almost a sob)
dialog: Oh, Johnny -- you fool! What does it
dialog: matter if you get a raise or a
dialog: partnership -- or anything!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (muffled against her
dialog: bosom)
dialog: Oh, Jane -- I let you down! I'll
dialog: always let you down! I'm no good!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (a wall of anguish)
dialog: Johnny, don't say that! It was my
dialog: fault for interfering. I made you do
dialog: it and I'm terribly sorry... I'll
dialog: never do it again... never. We don't
dialog: need anything -- we've got each other
dialog: and the baby -- our beautiful baby --
dialog: You're all I have and all I want --
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: -- and please -- if you feel bad
dialog: I'll die!
dialog: 
text: Johnny's head is lowered. He doesn't answer. A little pause.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Johnny, Johnny, look at me and tell
dialog: me you don't feel bad!
text: Another second's pause, then Johnny slowly lifts his head
text: with a grimace he thinks is a smile. His eyes are wet. Jane
text: sees his expression and starts to cry. He is completely
text: ashamed, puts his arms around her, and attempts to comfort
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Jane -- I don't feel bad.
text: They hold on to each other desperately, both of them crying
dialog: all the more.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (tears rolling down
dialog: his cheeks)
dialog: Jane -- I don't feel bad.
dialog: (as Jane sobs
dialog: convulsively)
dialog: I feel fine -- honest I do.
text: They cling to each other desperately. Jane kisses his tears
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (laughing through her
dialog: sobs)
dialog: Johnny, the next time you go out and
dialog: get tight... you'd better take me...
dialog: along with you... or I'll... I'll
dialog: get a divorce...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (abortive attempt at
dialog: laughter)
dialog: You'd better get a good lawyer.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (hysterical laughter)
dialog: I've got a good lawyer.

scene_heading: MONTAGE - SHEETS OF PAPER DRIFTING DOWN THE SCREEN
dialog: There are bills of all sorts -- installment furniture, market,
dialog: milk, telephone bill with discontinue threat -- the bills
dialog: are stamped: "Over-due" -- "Please pay up" -- "Please remit" --
text: etc. Included, perhaps is a reminder of a note due from the

text: knees calling to the baby.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: If you want something you gotta go
dialog: get it.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT (TAKING IN PATH ALONG THE GRASS)
text: Jane comes into the Shot and pauses as she hears Lily's voice.
text: She seems weary and downhearted, but her face lights up as
text: she looks off scene. She carries a folded newspaper in her
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: LILY'S VOICE
dialog: That's it -- come on now! Come on!
text: Jane starts toward them.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT
text: The baby reaches the cat and grabs it as Jane comes into the

text: clambers to her feet.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: Mis' Mason -- you should have seen

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - AT BENCH
text: Lily's smile changes to a look of concern as she looks at
dialog: Jane.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Is you tired?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I've been all over town. My head's
dialog: splitting.
text: Lily comes up behind her.
speaker_heading: LILY
text: Lean back, and let Lily rub the back
dialog: of your neck.
text: Jane's head goes back against the capacious bosom of Lily
text: standing behind the bench. Lily starts to rub Jane's neck
text: with strong capable fingers. With a sigh of content Jane
text: closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Been visitin' 'round, Mis' Mason?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Uh-huh.

dialog: (New Year's Eve)
text: The room presents a sorry contrast to the gay revelry going
text: on outside. There is a distinct aura of let-down and
text: depression. Sitting in an easy chair is Mrs. Mason a shawl
text: over her shoulder, sniffing at a tube of benzedrine and quite
text: miserable from a cold. Johnny, in evening clothes, is sprawled
text: on a window seat playing with the baby's toy cat, winding it
text: up and listening morosely to the music-box tune. The only
text: sound, except for what drifts in from the celebration in the

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: If he hasn't he certainly has a

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Then why do you suppose he hasn't at
dialog: least called up?
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (sniffing)
dialog: Perhaps he forgot all about it.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Mother, a man doesn't invite you to
dialog: a New Year's Eve party and then just
dialog: forget about it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Maybe we ought to go join him at the
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (a little exasperated)
dialog: Jane, I told you I don't know where
dialog: the party is. He said he'd call for
dialog: us here in his car at nine o'clock
dialog: sharp.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, it's almost eleven now.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Isn't the party also to announce his

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Well, perhaps he thought it might be
dialog: a little awkward to have you and

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Now, Mother! How could it be awkward?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Awkward or not awkward -- are we

dialog: All the same it might be awkward.
speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: He certainly didn't! He had no

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (tense with rage)
dialog: Oh yes you do! You've resented me
dialog: from the first moment you saw me!
dialog: You resented me because you wanted

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (injured)
dialog: My dear, I never said anything like
dialog: that!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You've hinted it often enough!
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON

dialog: I've done nothing of the sort! But
dialog: they were engaged.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Mother, I never was engaged to Eunice
dialog: Doolittle.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: Not what you'd call engaged, perhaps --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: And even if I were, you shouldn't
dialog: keep mentioning it to Jane all the
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: I can't understand why she's so touchy
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Touchy! That's why you hate me!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (agonized)
dialog: Jane -- will you please --
speaker_heading: MRS. MASON
dialog: (tosses her head)
dialog: No -- let her go on. She can say
dialog: anything she likes -- I know my place
dialog: here. I'm only a guest -- an unwelcome
dialog: guest.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (tortured)
dialog: For crying out loud! What's the matter

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mrs.

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON

speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm the stranger around here!
dialog: Everything I say is wrong! Everything
dialog: I do is wrong!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: MRS. MASON

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (hotly)
dialog: You said it to me too! Don't I count?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (at his wits end)
dialog: Of course you count, darling -- only
dialog: Mother's an old lady -- she won't be
dialog: with us for very long. Why can't you
dialog: get along with her?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: Why can't she get along with me?
dialog: Because she hates me! You don't know
dialog: how it is -- you're at the office

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - JOHNNY
text: He stands a moment, defeated and miserable -- then the flame

text: and sees the baby's white cat where he had previously dropped
text: it. He kicks the cat viciously across the room. CAMERA PANS
text: with him to the chair where his hat and overcoat are. He

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Johnny! Johnny!
text: She looks toward the chair in hall where her wrap and Johnny's
text: overcoat had been. Jane's wrap is there but Johnny's overcoat

speaker_heading: JOHNNY !
scene_heading: TOP OF STAIRWAY - OVERHEAD SHOT

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (surly)
dialog: What?
text: SHOOTING UP STAIRWAY

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Where are you going?
text: Johnny turns away as she catches up with him and stops one

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, I don't know. Anywhere to get
text: away from that wrangling.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Wait a minute!
dialog: (she runs down the
text: steps and joins him)
dialog: Don't you want me to go with you?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well -- can't you understand a man
dialog: wants to be alone once in a while?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm sorry, Johnny -- really I am.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: You don't have to apologize.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (hurt at his failure
dialog: to respond, but really
dialog: trying to help)
dialog: Would you rather I didn't come with
dialog: you?
text: He doesn't answer. Jane continues pleasantly -- with a sad

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: All right, Johnny. I don't mind. You
dialog: go along and have a good time.
dialog: (she turns and goes
dialog: up a step)
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (less than half-hearted)
dialog: Oh -- Come on along if you want to.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (she turns)
dialog: You're sure you don't mind?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (without enthusiasm)

text: in the scene about them.
text: Johnny finally meets Jane's eyes.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, Johnny, what's happened to us?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I don't know. Maybe I pulled a dirty
dialog: trick on you when I took that cinder
dialog: out of your eye up in Boston.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (with her heart in
dialog: her throat)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I mean -- maybe the whole thing's
dialog: been a mistake.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: What -- whole -- thing?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Our marriage.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (a quiet little cry
dialog: of pain)
dialog: Oh, Johnny.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (words pouring out of
dialog: him now)
dialog: I've gotten into debt -- I've gotten
dialog: nowhere at the office and I've made
dialog: a household drudge out of you, just
dialog: as Mother said. Jane, it hasn't worked
dialog: out -- it just hasn't worked out!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: But we've never had any real trouble.
dialog: Maybe a few silly little things --
dialog: things that everybody has to meet
dialog: when they get married.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Maybe we shouldn't have had the baby --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (this is a real kayo
dialog: for her)
dialog: Oh, Johnny -- you can't be sorry
dialog: about the baby?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I'm crazy about him!... And about

dialog: your whole life ahead of you --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Ahead of us --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: No -- not when you're dragged down
dialog: by a guy who just can't make the
dialog: grade. No, I'm not going to hold you
dialog: to that kind of a contract.
text: Jane leans back in her chair. She tries desperately to seem
dialog: matter-of-fact.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well -- you ought to know all about
dialog: contracts.
text: (she shrugs and fights
dialog: to keep her voice
dialog: steady)
dialog: Well, anyway, I suppose this is what
dialog: you'd call starting the New Year
dialog: right!
text: Johnny is too miserable to say anything. Jane tries to make

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: At least we've finally got something
dialog: we can celebrate.
text: (she lifts her glass
dialog: and her voice breaks)
dialog: Well -- Happy New Year --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Happy New Year.
text: He clicks glasses with her. Jane sips the wine and then bends

scene_heading: FULL SHOT - CAFE

text: The lights go out -- a whirling crystal ball from the ceiling
text: of the cafe starts to turn -- various colored flash-lights
text: play against it and cross each other, creating weird lighting
text: effects. From above a bunch of colored balloons tumble down.
text: Everybody in the near dark starts exchanging New Year's
dialog: kisses.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JOHNNY AND JANE IN THE CROWD
text: They look off at all the other revelers exchanging kisses.
text: Johnny and Jane seem to be the only ones who aren't kissing.
text: They look at each other embarrassed, and Jane, as always,
text: takes the initiative, looks into his eyes and then kisses
text: him tenderly. Johnny starts to put his arms around her, but
text: doesn't. The orchestra off scene strikes up "Auld Lang Syne."
text: The people sing. Johnny and Jane, holding hands, start to
text: sing with frantic efforts at a gaiety that they try to wring
text: from their leaden hearts.
text: After the first four lines, Jane can no longer control her
text: emotions, and she turns and starts away to keep from bursting
text: into tears. The singing continues.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I think I'll go phone the house and

scene_heading: CLOSE (MOVING) SHOT - IN FRONT OF JANE
dialog: (her face in Camera)

text: bibulous gents stretch arms out to stop her, but she proceeds,
text: fighting her way up toward a telephone booth.
text: People call to her as she presses through, but Jane pays no
text: attention. One woman, seeing the tears in Jane's eyes, calls:
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Crying Jag!
text: A happy drunk brushes past her:
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: Happy New Year, Blondie!
text: A man calls from a table as she passes:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hey Sister -- Wait a minute ---
speaker_heading: ANOTHER MAN
dialog: Hurry back, Honey!

text: Serpentine and long paper whistles unfold in front of her
dialog: face.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT JOHNNY AND JANE'S TABLE
text: Johnny edges his way past people and sits down at the table,
text: leaden-hearted and miserable. At an adjoining table a party

speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Hey, Lonely Heart -- what's the
dialog: matter?
text: Johnny makes a feeble attempt to call back in a croaking
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Happy New Year!

dialog: through Johnny's.
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: All alone? C'mon over and join our

speaker_heading: JOHNNY

dialog: Look what I found! A poor little
dialog: lamb lost in the storm -- alone and
dialog: neglected.
text: A chorus of hilarious greetings from the people at the table,

speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT

text: we hear him slam it closed.
speaker_heading: SIMON'S VOICE
dialog: You mustn't do this!... This is
dialog: outrageous!
text: The door in background is flung open and Johnny appears. The

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: What... what is this?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I've got to talk to you right now --
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Are you drunk?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: My kid's in the hospital -- he's got

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (not hearing)
dialog: You must be drunk waking me up in
dialog: the middle of the night like this --
dialog: it's outrageous! Never heard of such
dialog: a thing!
text: Johnny realizes Doolittle isn't hearing him. He looks around,
text: spots the judge's acousticon on the night table and reaches
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: Mason, if this is your way of
dialog: celebrating the New Year --
text: Johnny shoves the acousticon into Doolittle's hand.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (harshly)

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: No! -- You listen to me! When you
dialog: asked me to take a cut I took it --

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (beginning to doubt

dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (now comprehending)

dialog: Why didn't you get in touch with me
dialog: sooner? I'm terribly sorry.

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I don't need sympathy -- I need serum!
dialog: There isn't any in New York -- and
dialog: there's none anywhere near here --
dialog: and they finally located some in
dialog: Salt Lake City -- and that's two
dialog: thousand miles away and every hour
dialog: counts!
dialog: (he is almost sobbing

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (with utmost sympathy)
dialog: Now, Mason -- be calm --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I can't be calm -- I'll never be
dialog: calm till I get the serum. And the
dialog: only way to get it here is to fly it --
speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: Certainly!... Fly it!... Of course!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: JUDGE DOOLITTLE
dialog: (grabs hold of Johnny's

dialog: Now, Mason -- get hold of yourself!...
dialog: I know how you feel, but get hold of
dialog: yourself! Suppose the planes are
dialog: grounded -- Why can't you put it on
dialog: one of the fast trains?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: But we can't. I told you hours count --
dialog: every minute counts. It'd be too
dialog: late. We need a plane from Salt Lake
dialog: and we've got one but the pilot wants
dialog: five thousand dollars to fly it to
dialog: New York --

dialog: And Judge, I didn't have anyone else

scene_heading: CLOSE UP - CONWAY
text: His face is scratched and filthy. He opens his eyes, lifts
text: himself up with a grimace of pain. He stares for a moment at
text: his left foot, then starts to disengage the harness of the
text: chute. He remembers something and sticks his right hand
text: frantically on the inside of his coat. His hand comes out
text: with the package of serum. It is safe. He manages a grin
text: through his pain and puts it back inside his coat. He looks
text: around, tries to get to his feet, and realizes he can't walk.
text: His leg is broken. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HIM as he starts to

text: suit. The farmer pulls the package out and stares at it.
speaker_heading: FARMER
dialog: (reading the label)
dialog: St. Francis Hospital, New York City.
dialog: Rush.
text: The significance of the package dawns on him. He rises and
text: hurries to the telephone.
text: The phone is an old fashioned one, used only in rural
text: districts. The farmer turns the handle and the bell rings
text: the signal for the operator; he then takes down the receiver
dialog: and speaks.
speaker_heading: FARMER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello -- hello -- operator, I want
