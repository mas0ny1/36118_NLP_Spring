speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: 
dialog: Hows it feel to be the favorite
dialog: 
dialog: going into the last week of the
dialog:

speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: 
dialog: It aint over til its over.

dialog: 
dialog: The polls show you twelve points

speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: 
dialog: Gimme a dollar.  A dollar. For

dialog: Henry, take care of this.
speaker_heading: AIDE pulls HOMELESS
speaker_heading: MAN aside, as STIEGLER guides GIARDELLO
dialog: toward a stage.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN mumbles a curse.  A UNIFORM
dialog: shoves him further
text: back into the CROWD.  A CHANT from the
speaker_heading: CROWD:
dialog: Giardello.  Giardello.  Giardello.  DANIELS persists:
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: 
dialog: Your recent statements that, if
dialog: 
dialog: elected, youd push to legalize drugs --
dialog: 
dialog: Do you think this is the issue that
dialog: 
dialog: has set your campaign apart from
dialog: 
dialog: your rivals?
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: I know this city.  I know what drugs
dialog: 
dialog: have done to this city.  The murders
dialog: 
dialog: and robberies and domestic problems.
dialog: 
dialog: I believe that substance abuse is a
dialog: 
dialog: health issue.  Like drinking and
dialog: 
dialog: smoking.  Nicotine is more addictive
dialog: 
dialog: than heroin or cocaine, but you dont
dialog: 
dialog: see the Marlboro Man being sent to
dialog: 
dialog: Jessup on a three-to-five.  I love
dialog: 
dialog: this city.  I want this city to be whole again.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: 
dialog: But dont you --
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: (his slogan)
dialog: 
dialog: Educate, dont legislate.
speaker_heading: STIEGLER
dialog: 
dialog: Thats all for now.  Everyone please
dialog: 
dialog: step back.
speaker_heading: DANIELS
dialog: and CAMERAMAN step back as GIARDELLO ascends the
dialog: stage,
speaker_heading: where Mayor KURT SCHMOKE and other famous BALTIMOREONS
dialog: wait.
text: A huge CHEER from the CROWD as GIARDELLO steps to the
dialog: microphone:
dialog: We Want Al, We Want Al, Hes Our Pal.  We Want
dialog: Al.
dialog: GIARDELLO tries to quiet the CROWD, but the CHEERING
dialog: grows
speaker_heading: LOUDER.  Tons of FLASHBULBS from PRESS and AUDIENCE
dialog: are going
text: off.  As GIARDELLO smiles, a rapid dull REPEAT is
dialog: alarmed.
text: A BUZZ of concern and confusion.  STIEGLER and the
speaker_heading: CELEBRITIES
text: reflexively back away.  GIARDELLO watches UNIFORMS
speaker_heading: and PLAINCLOTHES
dialog: push through the CROWD, which is charged
dialog: with fear,
text: curious, looking around.  Then, GIARDELLO slumps
dialog: to his
text: knees.  His white shirt fills red with his blood.
speaker_heading: STIEGLER
dialog: and AIDES reach to support GIARDELLO, who looks out
dialog: at the
text: CROWD, confused, in pain.  He slumps forward.  On
speaker_heading: STIEGLER,

dialog: 
dialog: time, any place -- when it comes to
dialog: 
dialog: a crime.  But Im not investing in
dialog: 
dialog: your bar.  No way.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: Cmon, you can see for yourself that
dialog: 
dialog: The Waterfront is a money making
dialog: 
dialog: operation, a veritable green machine.
speaker_heading: FALSONE
dialog: 
dialog: Then whyre you so anxious to cut me
dialog: 
dialog: a slice?
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: Cause my other partners are all too
dialog: 
dialog: silent.  Munchs living large in New
dialog: 
dialog: York City.  Bayliss went on a semi-

dialog: permanent disappearing act.
speaker_heading: FALSONE

speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: Alan Funt, a great American.  I took
dialog: 
dialog: his passing very personally.
speaker_heading: FALSONE
dialog: 
dialog: So, whatve we got here?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Local dealer.  Shot in the head.
dialog: 
dialog: Looks like hes been dead at least a
dialog: 
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: FALSONE
dialog: 
dialog: Does our dead head have a name?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Joseph Hardwicke, a.k.a. Yin Yang.

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Then what happened, they were asleep?
speaker_heading: BARNFATHER
dialog: 
dialog: We had no reason to expect any trouble --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: No reason?  What about all the death
dialog: 
dialog: threats?
speaker_heading: STIEGLER
dialog: 
dialog: Theres been nothing out of the

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: How can you say that?  Since he
dialog: 
dialog: announced his position on drugs --
speaker_heading: BARNFATHER
dialog: 
dialog: Weve taken the serious threats
dialog: 
dialog: seriously --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Hate mail, faxes, anonymous phone

speaker_heading: BARNFATHER
dialog: 
dialog: The rest have been cranks --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Black nationalists, the Klan, red-

speaker_heading: BARNFATHER
dialog: 
dialog: Weve done everything possible.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: If youd done everything, we wouldnt
dialog: 
dialog: be standing here now.
dialog: Theyve been

speaker_heading: STIEGLER
dialog:

speaker_heading: LEWIS

speaker_heading: LEWIS

dialog: Weird.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: That day you cleaned out your desk

speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: I had things to think about.  Issues.
speaker_heading: LEWIS

speaker_heading: GHARTY

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON stares
text: at HALL, says nothing, then turns to GHARTY.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Can we get on with this?
speaker_heading: GHARTY
dialog: 
dialog: Yup.  A homeless man, who wont tell
dialog: 
dialog: us his name, grabbed Giardello just
dialog: 
dialog: before the shooting.
speaker_heading: FALSONE
dialog: 
dialog: Weve swabbed his hands for gunpowder

speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: 
dialog: Soon as the uniforms bring him up,

speaker_heading: STIVERS

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: And this event was covered by the press,
dialog: 
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: GHARTY
dialog: 
dialog: Way ahead of you, Frank.  Weve

speaker_heading: STIVERS
dialog:

speaker_heading: BALLARD

speaker_heading: LEWIS

speaker_heading: GHARTY

dialog: 
dialog: Pembleton, Lewis, Falsone, make a

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: A list?  I didnt come here

speaker_heading: GHARTY

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: 
dialog: the word?  Tenacious.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Yeah, well, he is that.
speaker_heading: BOLANDER
dialog: 
dialog: Not that he sent me flowers or
dialog: 
dialog: anything.  But he was like a pit

speaker_heading: BOLANDER

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Very blue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (yells to BAYLISS)

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Never.  Not this shade.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: No, huh?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: This is excessively blue.  Azure.

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON turns to BAYLISS.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON

speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN (v.o., cont.)

speaker_heading: HALL (v.o.)

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog:

speaker_heading: RUSSERT

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: I wish I did.
dialog: 
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: 
dialog: I used to be F.B.I. Liaison with the

dialog: 
dialog: bitterness between us...
speaker_heading: RUSSERT
dialog: 
dialog: But that didnt happen?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: If anything, working together made
dialog: 
dialog: things worse.  We were always stepping
dialog: 
dialog: on each others toes.  Then I had a
dialog: 
dialog: little dust-up with my boss at the
dialog: 
dialog: Bureau, so I quit.  Started over as
dialog: 
dialog: a Balto uniform, bottom of the totem
dialog: 
dialog: pole... I dont know if any of it
dialog: 
dialog: made any difference to my dad.  If
dialog: 
dialog: he even noticed.
speaker_heading: RUSSERT
dialog: 
dialog: Did you ever think to ask him?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: We dont have that kind of

dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: You wouldnt hurt anyone because
dialog: 
dialog: its not in you.  I know this about

dialog: 
dialog: You and he, you have a lot in common.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog:

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON

dialog: 
dialog: And what, now you think this is some
dialog: 
dialog: kind of deal where youre going to
dialog:

speaker_heading: BAYLISS

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: We could.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog:

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON

speaker_heading: MILLER looks
speaker_heading: at LEWIS and SHEPPARD.
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD
dialog: 
dialog: Where were you this morning around
dialog: 
dialog: eight-fifteen?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: 
dialog: When Giardello got shot?
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: 
dialog: On the air.  And when the good news
dialog: 
dialog: came out over the Jewish-controlled
dialog: 
dialog: mainstream media, we popped a bottle
dialog: 
dialog: of genuine American sparkling wine
dialog: 
dialog: and shared the glad tidings with our
dialog: 
dialog: listeners across the country.
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD
dialog: 
dialog: Across the country?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: 
dialog: We reach most of our followers on
dialog: 
dialog: the Internet.
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD
dialog: 
dialog: You can verify you were in the studio
dialog: 
dialog: at the time of the shooting?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: 
dialog: Ill play you the tapes.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: Those can be faked.  You couldve
dialog: 
dialog: been on the air and nowhere near
dialog: 
dialog: this place.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: 
dialog: Ill give you a list of people who
dialog: 
dialog: were in and out of the station all
dialog: 
dialog: morning and saw me.  In the flesh.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: Heres a pen.  Start writing.
speaker_heading: MILLER starts
dialog: writing, laughs.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: 
dialog: I do wish we were on the air right
dialog: 
dialog: now, so that I could describe you
dialog: 
dialog: all for the benefit of my audience.
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD
dialog: 
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: 
dialog: Well, were always talking on my
dialog: 
dialog: program about mud people -- youre
dialog: 
dialog: familiar with the term?
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD
dialog: 
dialog: Yeah.  I am.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: 
dialog: One of our favorite topics.  Along
dialog: 
dialog: with the evils of race-mixing.
dialog: 
dialog: And look at the two of you.  Prime
dialog: 
dialog: examples of both.
speaker_heading: On LEWIS and

speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: Gotta admit, theyve come a long way
dialog: 
dialog: from Grand Kleagles, burning crosses
dialog: 
dialog: and Birth of a Nation --
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD
dialog: 
dialog: Yup.  Good old boys have definitely
dialog: 
dialog: traded their bedsheets for websites.
dialog: 
dialog: (re: list)
dialog: 
dialog: Assuming these check out, Millers
dialog: 
dialog: not Gees shooter.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: No, but he might have told someone
dialog: 
dialog: else to pull the trigger.
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD
dialog: 
dialog: Or he might have just incited it.
dialog: 
dialog: If the shooter turns out to be one
dialog: 
dialog: of his regular listeners, maybe we
dialog: 
dialog: can tie Miller in.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: Man, Id love to pin something on
dialog: 
dialog: this racist clown, some kinda
dialog: 
dialog: conspiracy charge --
speaker_heading: Three SKINHEADS
dialog: block the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: SKINHEAD
dialog: 
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: On second thought, they may have
dialog: 
dialog: changed, but they aint evolved
speaker_heading: SHEPPARD
dialog: 
dialog: Ask me. theyre going backwards.
speaker_heading: SKINHEAD
dialog: 
dialog: We got rights, too.  Freedom of
dialog: 
dialog: speech.  You made a big mistake
dialog: 
dialog: closing down Millers show --
speaker_heading: SKINHEAD puts
text: his hands on SHEPPARD, who flips him around
dialog: and cuffs him
dialog: as LEWIS simultaneously draws his gun and badges
speaker_heading: other two SKINHEADS.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog:

speaker_heading: BARNFATHER

dialog: We had officers posted on every floor.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Then how did the shooter get in?  If
dialog: 
dialog: I were paranoid, Id say someone in
dialog:

speaker_heading: BARNFATHER
dialog: 
dialog: Im gonna forget you said that --
speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: Has QRT has sealed off the building?

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: SALERNO

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: got shot?
speaker_heading: SALERNO
dialog: 
dialog: Doctor Williams.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Is he gonna make it?
speaker_heading: SALERNO

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: BARNFATHER

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Of course theyre related, whatre
dialog:

speaker_heading: BARNFATHER
dialog:

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: The shooter was after my father --
speaker_heading: BARNFATHER

speaker_heading: WEEKS

dialog: 
dialog: dont they do what hes saying, you
dialog: 
dialog: know, kick the bottom out of the
dialog: 
dialog: market by making the stuff legal.
dialog: 
dialog: Put me outta business like that --
dialog: He misses shot.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS takes a turn.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: So youre happy about somebody trying
dialog: 
dialog: to kill Giardello?
speaker_heading: WEEKS
dialog: 
dialog: I didnt say that.  Could backfire.
dialog: 
dialog: The, whatchacallit, sympathy vote.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: You know our next question.
speaker_heading: WEEKS
dialog: 
dialog: Do I got an alibi?
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WEEKS
dialog: 
dialog: (reaching for cellphone)
dialog:

speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: (stops him)
dialog: 
dialog: You dont have to lawyer up.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: This is still friendly.  You lawyer
dialog: 
dialog: up, we gotta put you in the system.
dialog: 
dialog: Waste a time for all of us.
speaker_heading: WEEKS
dialog: 
dialog: You Homicide, right?  Know anybody
dialog:

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Yes.  Absolutely.
speaker_heading: WEEKS
dialog: 
dialog: You got any juice with Steve Fletcher?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: (no clue)
dialog: 
dialog: I could talk to him, yeah.
speaker_heading: WEEKS
dialog: 
dialog: If you could get the bastard off my
dialog: 
dialog: back -- Hes camping out on my front
dialog: 
dialog: stoop.  My oldest daughter thinks
dialog: 
dialog: hes gonna kill me, bust the door
dialog: 
dialog: down and grease me in my own bed.
dialog: 
dialog: The stress is aggravating her asthma.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Ill speak to him.
speaker_heading: WEEKS
dialog: 
dialog: I didnt do Giardello.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: What about your crew?
speaker_heading: WEEKS
dialog: 
dialog: Them neither.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Witness put Easy Moe at the scene.
speaker_heading: WEEKS
dialog: 
dialog: He doesnt work for me anymore.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Know where we can find him?
speaker_heading: WEEKS
dialog: 
dialog: Id try his momas house first.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON (cont.)
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: Eddies the shooter, hes in the
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: find him on our own.  I could use a
dialog: 
dialog: cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Im buying.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: I cant.  Cause of the stroke --
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Oh, yeah.  For a minute, I forgot.
dialog: 
dialog: For a minute, time seemed not to
dialog: 
dialog: have gone by.  For a minute, it was
dialog: 
dialog: eight years ago... Yknow, Frank, I

dialog:

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON

speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: A cop.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Why would one of us wanna shoot the
dialog: 
dialog: Lieutenant?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Not one of us.  A cop with attitudes.
dialog: 
dialog: Prejudices.  A red-neck cop.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: God knows there are plenty of them.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: A Gaffney.  A guy whos put in the
dialog: 
dialog: time, walked the beat, now sees
dialog: 
dialog: Giardello making the reach for power --
dialog: 
dialog: decides to change history.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Interesting theory.  Cops as killers.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Happens.  Kellerman plugged Luther
dialog: 
dialog: Mahoney.  And I still think a boy in
dialog: 
dialog: blue finished off Gordon Pratt.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Me too.  But saying youre right,
dialog: 
dialog: saying some law enforcement officer
dialog: 
dialog: shot Gee, how do we find him?  Where
dialog: 
dialog: do we start to look?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: I dont know.  Needle n haystack
dialog: 
dialog: time... lets go see how Ballard and
dialog: 
dialog: Stivers are doing with the video
dialog: 
dialog: tapes.
dialog: They get to Car.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON (cont.)
dialog: 
dialog: You know why I left Homicide?  Because
dialog: 
dialog: I couldnt hear one more confession.
dialog: 
dialog: I got sick of hearing people confess
dialog: 
dialog: to me.  Like some Jesuit, I would
dialog: 
dialog: sit there in The Box, listening to
dialog: 
dialog: a man not just admit that hed killed
dialog: 
dialog: someone.  But cop to all the crap in
dialog: 
dialog: his life, over the course of his
dialog: 
dialog: life, that had led him to that moment.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: The merit of a whole life can be
dialog: 
dialog: undone in a single moment.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Who said that?
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: The Buddha.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: The Buddha.  Huh.  Well, he was right,
dialog: 
dialog: exactly.  But unlike a priest, I
dialog: 
dialog: could never give the man what he
dialog: 
dialog: really needed --absolution.  I could
dialog: 
dialog: only give him prison time.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS

dialog: 
dialog: Your father was shot twice in the

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: So whats your most pessimistic
dialog: 
dialog: assessment?
speaker_heading: EHRLICH
dialog: 
dialog: Recoverys going to take time, but I
dialog: 
dialog: think his long-term prognosis is

dialog: 
dialog: My what?  Rights? --
dialog: 
dialog: (smiles, looks away)
dialog: 
dialog: I have a right to have things as

dialog: 
dialog: always played by the rules.  Cut my
dialog: 
dialog: lawn, paid my taxes, didnt honk at
dialog: 
dialog: anyone coming out of the church
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: to do?  I dont deserve my Tommy

speaker_heading: JAMES

dialog: I shot him, yeah.  I was aiming for
dialog: 
dialog: Schmoke, too, but, hey, why should I
dialog: 
dialog: expect to be a sharpshooter, huh?
dialog: 
dialog: Why should I expect my boy to go
dialog: 
dialog: into Baltimore, buy himself his dope
dialog: 
dialog: and O.D. right on the street?  Why
dialog: 
dialog: should I expect his friends who I
dialog: 
dialog: know were with him, why do they leave
dialog: 
dialog: him on the street, right there at
dialog: 
dialog: Broadway and Fleet and let him die?
dialog: 
dialog: Three months ago almost to the day.
dialog: 
dialog: And this is how Tommy leaves his

dialog: room.  If hedve just cleaned the

dialog: damn place up, I couldve sold our
dialog: 
dialog: home.  But, naw, hes gotta leave it
dialog: 
dialog: like this.  His personal touches.
dialog: 
dialog: How can I sell this house that his
dialog: 
dialog: mother cannot stand to live in
dialog: 
dialog: anymore?  I shot the dealer who sold
dialog: 
dialog: Tommy the drugs.  And that man,
dialog: 
dialog: Giardello, because he wants to
dialog: 
dialog: legalize drugs.  Im trying to stop
dialog: 
dialog: that.  Ill shot whoever says its
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: blew his brains out.  I executed him
dialog: 
dialog: in cold blood.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: And Im saying, Internal rules it
dialog: 
dialog: was a good shooting.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON

dialog: 
dialog: Im saying its an accident.  For
dialog: 
dialog: you to shoot someone, it has to be a
dialog: 
dialog: mistake.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: No mistake, no accident.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Tim --
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Youre a good cop.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Im not a cop anymore.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Youll always be a cop.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Im a teacher now.  A civilian.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: I murdered this guy, cause he was a
dialog: 
dialog: predator.  He preyed on women.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: I put the gun right up to the mothers
dialog: 
dialog: brain and I pulled the trigger.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Shut up. Just -- shut up.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: What do I do, Frank?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: You put this on me?  You sunofabitch.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: You have a conscience.  I have one.
dialog: 
dialog: I dont know why mine keeps kicking
dialog: 
dialog: me, but it does.  All the time.
dialog: 
dialog: (taps his chest, open-
dialog: 
dialog: palmed)
dialog: 
dialog: Here  Im okay with it.  In my heart,
dialog: 
dialog: I know I saved some girls life.
dialog: 
dialog: Some girl in New Orleans.  Who will
dialog: 
dialog: never know.  Thats where Ryland was
dialog: 
dialog: headed.  He said the girls were easy
dialog: 
dialog: there.  Hed have access --
dialog: 
dialog: (taps his temple)
dialog: 
dialog: But here?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON and BAYLISS exchange a look.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: I come back for this.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Maybe its cause this James guy
dialog: 
dialog: hes going to jail for basically the
dialog: 
dialog: same reasons I had for doing what I
dialog: 
dialog: did.  And Im out here.  Free.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: You wait til Im back and then you
dialog: 
dialog: have to unload, huh?  Unburden
dialog: 
dialog: yourself... Whats supposed to happen
dialog: 
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: You tell me.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Im not bringing you in.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: No, huh?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Im not a cop.  Im not official.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: So youll what, not tell anyone?
dialog: 
dialog: Keep my secret to yourself?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Sunofabitch.  Youre a sunofabitch.
dialog: 
dialog: You murdered him.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Whos the primary?
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Lewis.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: You talk to him?
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Youre the first to know.  Who else
dialog: 
dialog: was I going to tell?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: But did you talk to Lewis?
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: About the case?  No.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: No one suspects it was you.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Cmon, me?  Whod suspect me?  Good
dialog: 
dialog: old Tim Bayliss.  The Zen Detective.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Hunh.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: So youll take me in.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Im going to take you in?  Are you wild?
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Youll take me in.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Did I take a bullet for you once?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Cut it out.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Did I?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Im not taking you in.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: I take one for you, you take one for
dialog: 
dialog: me.  Thats square business.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: This is not taking a bullet for you.
dialog: 
dialog: This is you wanting me to toss your
dialog: 
dialog: ass into a jackpot.  Youre confessing
dialog: 
dialog: to a murder, Tim.  You understand
dialog: 
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: You want someone else to bring me
dialog: 
dialog: in.  Someone else should bust me.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Then it has to be you.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: I thought about eating my gun.  I
dialog: 
dialog: figured if I didnt tell you and you
dialog: 
dialog: didnt do what is right --
dialog: 
dialog: (taps temple)
dialog: 
dialog: -- for here -- then theres only one
dialog: 
dialog: other way out.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Tim, cops in prison -- not a pretty
dialog: 
dialog: sight.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: I respect you, Frank, I love... you...
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON and
dialog: BAYLISS look off, then back at each other.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: You thought about putting a gun to
dialog: 
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Youd be saving my life.  I dont
dialog: 
dialog: know for how long, but for now, at
dialog: 
dialog: least, you would.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: I believe that you didnt mean to do
dialog: 
dialog: this killing.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: If thats what you want to believe.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Do you want to go back inside now?
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Never delay whats inevitable, right?
dialog: 
dialog: It has to be what it has to be.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Sonofabitch.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Frank, do you absolve me?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Absolve you?  I cant.
speaker_heading: BAYLISS
dialog: 
dialog: Cant  You mean you wont.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: I cant.  Can not.  Its not within
dialog: 
dialog: my power...
speaker_heading: BAYLISS takes
text: his badge out of his pocket, hands it to
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON.
dialog: PEMBLETON looks at it a moment, puts it in his
dialog: pocket, looks
dialog: out at the sky.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON (cont.)
dialog: 
dialog: I think maybe Mary and I should stay
dialog: 
dialog: home tonight and have dinner with
dialog: 
dialog: the kids.
speaker_heading: As PEMBLETON
speaker_heading: and BAYLISS start back to Headquarters,
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: COX

dialog: 
dialog: to die.
dialog: ALL toast, hear-hear.
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: 
dialog: Heres to Bayliss and Pembleton --
speaker_heading: STIVERS
dialog: 
dialog: Where are Bayliss and Pembleton?
speaker_heading: KELLERMAN
dialog: 
dialog: Cmon, you expect to see the
dialog: 
dialog: notoriously anti-social Frank
dialog: 
dialog: Pembleton here?
speaker_heading: DANVERS
dialog: 
dialog: And Bayliss, who knows?
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: Yeah, who could ever figure Bayliss
dialog: 
dialog: out.  I mean, is he gay or bi or
dialog: 
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: 
dialog: Who cares?
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: 
dialog: Hey, hey, Im in the middle of a
dialog: 
dialog: toast.  And its bad luck not to
dialog: 
dialog: finish a toast.
speaker_heading: LAUSANNE
dialog: 
dialog: Says who?
speaker_heading: BALLARD
dialog: 
dialog: Says me.  So... To Bayliss and
dialog: 
dialog: Pembleton, who doggedly pursued the
dialog: 
dialog: case -- despite interference from
dialog: 
dialog: the Bosses -- and brought the shooter
dialog: 
dialog: to justice.
dialog: ALL toast, hear-hear.

speaker_heading: FALSONE
dialog: 
dialog: Yknow, Lewis, I have always liked
dialog: 
dialog: this joint.  Maybe I will be your
dialog: 
dialog: partner.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: 
dialog: No. Really?
speaker_heading: FALSONE
dialog: 
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: MUNCH
dialog: 
dialog: Ill sell you my share.  In a New
dialog: 
dialog: York minute.
speaker_heading: BILLIE LOU
dialog: 
dialog: Not so fast.  Were still married.
dialog: 
dialog: I own half of your third.
speaker_heading: FALSONE raises

speaker_heading: FALSONE

speaker_heading: BRODIE
dialog: 
dialog: The hospital.
speaker_heading: BOLANDER
dialog: 
dialog: Whats the latest?
speaker_heading: BRODIE
dialog: 
dialog: He died.  Lieutenant Giardello died.
dialog: Shock, confusion.
speaker_heading: BOLANDER
dialog: 
dialog: Thats not funny, son.
speaker_heading: BRODIE
dialog: 
dialog: The doctor says it was some kind of
dialog: 
dialog: aneurysm.  It was fast.  There was
dialog: 
dialog: no pain.
speaker_heading: BOLANDER
dialog: 
dialog: No pain, huh?
speaker_heading: BRODIE
dialog: 
dialog: Thats what the doctor said.
speaker_heading: BOLANDER turns
text: to HOWARD, takes her hand.  BALLARD starts to
speaker_heading: cry.  FALSONE
text: comforts her.  KELLERMAN and COX hug.  STIVERS
speaker_heading: leans on DANVERS.
speaker_heading: SCHEINER, GRISCOM, SHEPPARD and LAUSANNE

dialog: MUNCHs shoulder.
dialog: LEWIS rises, exits.
speaker_heading: 101     EXT. THAMES STREET - NIGHT
speaker_heading: LEWIS comes out,
dialog: stares up at Police Headquarters, sees:
scene_heading: 102     EXT.  BALCONY/POLICE HEADQUARTERS -
speaker_heading: NIGHT
dialog: MIKE stands looking
dialog: down at The Waterfront.  LEWIS nods to
dialog: MIKE, who returns
text: the gesture.  MIKE heads inside.
scene_heading: 103     INT. LOBBY/POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
dialog: MIKE, grieving,
dialog: stops, feels in his pocket, takes out his
dialog: Rosary.
text: He contemplates it a long moment, puts it back in
dialog: pocket.
dialog: As MIKE enters:
speaker_heading: 104     INT. SQUAD ROOM/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT
dialog: MIKE walks past
speaker_heading: unfamiliar FACES.  NAOMI walks by.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Uh, listen, you mind if I take a
dialog: 
dialog: peek in his office?  What used to be
dialog: 
dialog: his office?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: 
dialog: Lieutenants out, Im sure he wouldnt
dialog: 
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: NAOMI walks on.
dialog: MIKE goes over, enters:
speaker_heading: 105     INT. LIEUTENANTS OFFICE/HOMICIDE UNIT -
speaker_heading: NIGHT
dialog: MIKE stands there,
dialog: looks around.  He tries to feel his
dialog: fathers presence.
dialog: He finds one picture on the wall of
dialog: Giardello, takes
text: Rosary out of his pocket and hangs it on
dialog: corner of frame.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON enters.
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Oh.  Hello, Im Frank Pembleton.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog:

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON

speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Yeah... Im good at catching bad
dialog: 
dialog: guys.  Caught me a couple tonight.
dialog: 
dialog: (looks at Squad Room)
dialog: 
dialog: Lotta people have worked in that
dialog: 
dialog: room over the years.  Lot of em
dialog: 
dialog: have died.  Beau Felton got killed
dialog: 
dialog: in the line of duty.  Steve Crosetti
dialog: 
dialog: committed suicide.  To this day, no
dialog: 
dialog: one knows why...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Do you miss it, Homicide?
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: I dunno.  You can never really escape,
dialog: 
dialog: yknow, cause death is everyday,
dialog: 
dialog: death goes on and on and on...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Thats because life goes on and on.
dialog: 
dialog: Here.  And there...
speaker_heading: PEMBLETON
dialog: 
dialog: Where is there?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Wherever.
dialog: A moment of silence.
dialog: THEY exit.
speaker_heading: 106     INT. SQUAD ROOM/HOMICIDE UNIT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: As MIKE and PEMBLETON
dialog: exit Squad Room they walk past
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO, who
dialog: enters.  They cant see each other.  GIARDELLO
dialog: stops, looks
dialog: around, surprised to find himself there.  The
speaker_heading: unfamiliar FACES
dialog: of a moment ago are gone, replaced by POLICE
speaker_heading: OFFICERS from
dialog: the Twenties, Thirties, Forties, Fifties,
dialog: Sixties, Seventies
dialog: and Eighties in period uniforms.  All
dialog: killed in the
dialog: line of duty.  GIARDELLO acknowledges a few of
dialog: them, nods to
dialog: three OFFICERS killed by Junior Bunk in the
dialog: big Squad Room
text: shoot-out.  A LITTLE BLACK GIRL skips by him.
dialog: He knows who
dialog: she is:
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog:

speaker_heading: GIARDELLO

speaker_heading: CROSETTI (cont.)
dialog: 
dialog: Ten of spades to Mister Beau Felton.
dialog: 
dialog: Jack of diamonds to my esteemed
dialog: 
dialog: Lieutenant, eight of clubs to yours
dialog: 
dialog: truly --
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: Whatre we playing?
speaker_heading: CROSETTI
dialog: 
dialog: Five card stud.

speaker_heading: FELTON

dialog: Ten.
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO

speaker_heading: CROSETTI (cont.)
dialog: 
dialog: Pair of tens showing to Mister Felton,

speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: Whos the fourth chair for?
speaker_heading: FELTON
dialog: 
dialog: We dont know yet.  But theyll be
dialog: 
dialog: here sooner or later.
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: Anybody I know?
speaker_heading: CROSETTI
dialog: 
dialog: Maybe.  It aint like its written
dialog: 
dialog: in stone, Lieutenant.  Pre-ordained
dialog: 
dialog: or anything.
speaker_heading: FELTON
dialog: 
dialog: Take you, for example.  If youd
dialog: 
dialog: just slept five minutes longer this
dialog: 
dialog: morning, you woulda run into this
dialog: 
dialog: fender bender on Light Street on
dialog: 
dialog: your way to the Inner Harbor --
speaker_heading: CROSETTI
dialog: 
dialog: Which wouldve made you a half hour
dialog: 
dialog: late for your speech --
speaker_heading: FELTON
dialog: 
dialog: And the guy who shot you woulda got
dialog: 
dialog: nervous and left --
speaker_heading: CROSETTI
dialog: 
dialog: Probably shot somebody else --
speaker_heading: FELTON
dialog: 
dialog: And we wouldnt now be having the
dialog: 
dialog: pleasure of your company.
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: I suddenly got worried that -- My
dialog: 
dialog: son, hes a cop.  I thought, maybe --
speaker_heading: CROSETTI
dialog: 
dialog: I wouldnt worry.  Life is short,
dialog: 
dialog: but once youre dead, youre a long
dialog: 
dialog: time dead, if you know what I mean.
speaker_heading: FELTON
dialog: 
dialog: Your son -- ?
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: Michael.
speaker_heading: FELTON
dialog: 
dialog: Hes a good kid?
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FELTON
dialog: 
dialog: You taught him well?
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: I did my best.  I wish Id --
speaker_heading: CROSETTI
dialog: 
dialog: Uh-uh-uh.  No regrets.
speaker_heading: FELTON
dialog: 
dialog: Just have to wait and see.  See what
dialog: 
dialog: hand hes dealt --
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: And how he plays it.
speaker_heading: FELTON
dialog: 
dialog: The best thing about this place?
dialog: 
dialog: All those cares and worries you had
dialog: 
dialog: in life?  They dont matter anymore.
dialog: 
dialog: Rest in peace, means what it says.
speaker_heading: CROSETTI
dialog: 
dialog: You want some coffee?
speaker_heading: GIARDELLO
dialog: 
dialog: Coffee?  Coffee would be good.  You
