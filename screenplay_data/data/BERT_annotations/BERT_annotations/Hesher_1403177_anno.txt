text: A small kid, TJ FORNEY (13), with a grubby worn cast on his arm,
text: rides his BMX really fast down a street. He chases a tow truck
text: towing a badly wrecked red Volvo.
text: 
text: He struggles to keep up. The truck makes a turn. TJ follows,
text: turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic.
text: 
text: The truck makes another turn. TJ turns with it, running straight
text: into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway. He comes off
text: his bike and is thrown across the hood. He picks himself up,
text: stunned. The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt.
text: 
text: TJ looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in
text: the distance. He hurries back to his bike. He jumps on and
text: continues after the truck.
text: 
text: TJ gives chase. He gains on the truck. He can see it pull into a
text: used car lot ahead - FAIR OAKS CAR CITY.
text:

speaker_heading: TOW TRUCK DRIVER
dialog: What are you talking about, kid?

speaker_heading: TJ

speaker_heading: TOW TRUCK DRIVER
dialog: I was told to bring it here. That's

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: And where was it supposed to go?
text: 
speaker_heading: TJ
dialog: It wasn't supposed to go anywhere. It

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (TO TONY)
dialog: What's the deal with this car again,

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Ah let's see, we bought this car
dialog: yesterday afternoon from a Paul Forney-
text: 
speaker_heading: TJ
dialog: That's my dad. It wasn't his to sell.
text: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: Well, it's his name on the pink slip,
dialog: son. And that means it's his to sell
dialog: if he wants.

speaker_heading: TJ

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Thanks, Bill.
dialog: (TO TONY)
dialog: You got that work order there?
text: 
text: Tony looks through his papers for the work order. TJ doesn't
text: like being ignored. He moves around to the driver's side of the
text: wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed-in door. He climbs
text: behind the wheel, slams the door shut and locks the door.
text: 
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Get out of the car, son.

speaker_heading: DUSTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon. Open it.

speaker_heading: DUSTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow, fuck. What the fuck you doing?
dialog: Open it.
text:

speaker_heading: DUSTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Put down the fuckin' window. I'm

speaker_heading: DAD

scene_heading: INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - MORNING
text: 
text: TJ stands holding a banana and wearing a backpack in front of
text: the couch where his dad is sleeping. Dad is lying face down,
text: half-covered with a sheet, his leg hanging off the side. There's
text: dirty plates and pill bottles on the coffee table in what is
text: otherwise an old lady's living room. Dad stirs, it's a pathetic
text: sight.
text: 
text: TJ taps Dad's leg with his foot. Dad slowly comes to life and

speaker_heading: DAD

scene_heading: EXT. FORNEY HOUSE - MORNING
text: 
text: TJ on his BMX pedals down the drive and out onto the street.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: 
text: TJ pedals in the middle of a suburban street. He steers his bike
text: with his broken arm as he tries to peel and eat the banana with
text: the other. He glides down a hill. It's a long hill. He travels
dialog: fast.
text: 
text: Despite the glide and the wind in his hair he's slouching and
text: looks depressed.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: 
text: TJ rides his bike through an eerily barren unfinished housing
text: development - half-built houses and perfectly sealed wide
text: streets.
text: 
text: Up ahead, he can see a small section of unfinished road - a big
text: patch of dirt and rocks. He veers up a driveway to avoid it. He
text: passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto
text: the road, trying to keep control of his bike. He hits the road
text: and loses his balance. The handlebars twist and he crashes onto
text: the road.
text: 
text: He jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. He looks at
text: it. It's badly grazed. He yelps again, angry. He picks up a rock
text: lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. He
text: hurls the rock through its front window. Glass crashes down.
text: 
text: A silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens
text: and a late-20s, long-greasy-haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy
text: black jeans emerges. He has a baby moustache and a cracked front
text: tooth. This is HESHER. He makes a determined line toward TJ.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: The fuck you think you're doing!?
text: 
text: Before TJ can back away Hesher grabs him by the back of his T-
text: shirt and drags him kicking and squealing towards the house.

text: 
text: 
scene_heading: INT. HALF-BUILT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: 
text: Hesher drags TJ into the unfinished front room. He slams TJ
text: against an uncoated drywall. Hesher pulls a pair of garden
text: shears from his back pocket and squeezes TJ's nose between the
dialog: blades.
text: 
text: TJ is terrified. He squirms.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: The fuck you think you're doing!?

speaker_heading: TJ
dialog: I was just, I was just going to

text: 
text: Hesher stares intimidatingly at TJ. TJ looks seriously scared.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: Bullshit. You're gonna fuckin' -
text: 
text: Hesher is suddenly startled. His ears prick up like a rabbit. He
text: hits the deck dragging TJ down with him. Their faces are close
text: together. Hesher makes a very serious finger-to-mouth gesture to
dialog: 'shhhh'.
text: 
text: The SOUND of a car idling outside. Hesher listens.
text: 
text: TJ is on his stomach, freaked. TJ looks around the room - a
text: duffel bag, some beer cans, a few porn magazines, a weathered
text: bass guitar and a sleeping bag.
text: 
text: A car door closes loudly. Hesher peers through the window and
text: sees a SECURITY GUARD inspecting TJ's bike in the front yard and
text: then making his way toward the house.
text: 
text: Hesher looks at TJ with serious and considered venom.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You just fucked me.
text: 
text: Hesher snaps into action. With speed and precision he gathers

speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD (O.S.)
dialog: Who's in there?

text: slips out the back door, leaving TJ face down on the floor
text: freaked out and confused.
text: 
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell-
text: 
text: BOOM! Dirt sprays against the house and pours in through the
text: window. TJ cowers, then hears the guttural roar of a van
text: starting up. He hears the van screech away.
text: 
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! Get back here!
text: 
text: TJ jumps to his feet and looks out the window. A dirty black van
text: screams out onto the road and tears away, spraying dirt and
text: rocks in its wake. The security guard stumbles around, covered
text: in dirt and disoriented. He rushes back to his car and gives
text: chase. TJ lets them get away up the street, then bolts to the
text: front door.

scene_heading: EXT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

dialog: Lots of noise.
text: 
text: TJ rides down a path and clocks Dustin Howard, the kid from the
text: car lot, who stands talking with friends by his car - a shiny
text: 2007 YELLOW CONVERTIBLE MUSTANG. They spot each other. TJ
text: quickly looks away (oh shit) and b-lines for the bike rack.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL / HALL - DAY
text: 
text: TJ opens his locker. He pulls out a clear zip-lock bag with a

text: have been scrawled beside the picture. Dustin swerves the car
text: toward TJ, narrowly missing him. TJ cuts into a large super

scene_heading: INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - CONTINUOUS

text: TJ and Dad stand just inside the TV room, stunned, watching the
dialog: newly acquired porn.
text: 
text: Then a LOUD BUZZ marking the end of the wash's cycle sounds from

speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: Huh?

scene_heading: INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TV ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: TJ

text: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I don't know. We're talking at least
dialog: eighteen hundred dollars, not
dialog: including taxes, registration, ADM, or
dialog: dealer's fees. On top of that, you'd
dialog: need a driver's license. I'm guessing
dialog: you don't have one of those. You'd
dialog: need valid car insurance. I'm guessing
dialog: you don't have that either. But even
dialog: if you did have these things, I still

speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)

text: As if he were possessed by the music, Hesher veers dangerously
text: off the road onto a dirt patch. He has a crazed look in his

text: 
text: Hesher turns the wheel hard and floors the gas. The van spins in

speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Who's that guy?

speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)

text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, shit. More trash coming in!

speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit!

dialog: things to break.

speaker_heading: NICOLE

text: climbing up his arm.
text: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Do you realize that the equivalent to

text: the diving board. He climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid

speaker_heading: GRANDMA
dialog: What is that?
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER
text: It's a bong. The water filters the
dialog: smoke. It's probably the most healthy
dialog: way to smoke weed.
text: 
text: Hesher lights up and takes a HUGE hit from the bong. He explains
text: his technique to Grandma while holding the smoke in.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: OK, so basically cover the hole here
dialog: with your thumb then suck on the top
text: and once the chamber fills with smoke,
dialog: take your finger off the hole and suck
dialog: in.

text: Hesher takes a quick sip of air sucking the smoke deeper into

text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Then try and hold the smoke in for as
dialog: long as possible, OK bro?
text: 
speaker_heading: GRANDMA

speaker_heading: HESHER

speaker_heading: GRANDMA

text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: Yeah, that was good. Hit it again.

speaker_heading: GRANDMA
dialog: Actually, there's no limit to the food

speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: Yeah, OK, well anyway... I used to
dialog: have a snake and I fed it mice. But
dialog: one time I fed this little fuckin'
dialog: mouse to my snake and that mouse was
dialog: tough. I dropped that mouse in the
dialog: snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go

dialog: called.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: With his little mouse hand. So instead
dialog: of eating the mouse the snake just
text: curled up crying in the corner and the
dialog: mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And
dialog: this went on for weeks, the snake
dialog: wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse
dialog: used to sit in a little miniature lawn
dialog: chair scratching his balls and
dialog: shelling peanuts and this snake was
dialog: just too scared to go near it. And cuz
dialog: the snake was scared of that mouse I
dialog: had to feed him other mice, but every
dialog: time I dropped another mouse in the
dialog: tank, it'd hide behind the brave
dialog: mouse. And so eventually the snake
dialog: starved to death. I had a cage full of

speaker_heading: FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't want you to feel rushed, but
dialog: we are really under the pump today and
dialog: I just thought I should give you the
text: heads up. Now, I notice, just looking
dialog: at your order of service... (beat,
dialog: thinking) Ah, look, let's play it by
dialog: ear. We should be fine.
text: 
text: Dad looks at the funeral director, not quite sure he's hearing

text: 
speaker_heading: FUNERAL DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: OK. Excuse me.

text: The funeral director walks away and answers his phone.

scene_heading: INT. SERVICE ROOM - DAY
text: 
text: The funeral director stands at the front of the room. He hits
text: play on the in-house stereo - generic classical musak. TJ and
text: Dad take seats next to each other, but they might as well be a
text: hundred miles apart. About ten other people sit.
text: 
text: The funeral director hits stop. He stands and approaches the
dialog: microphone.
text: 
speaker_heading: FUNERAL DIRECTOR
dialog: We are gathered here today to mourn
dialog: the loss and commemorate the life of
dialog: Madeleine Frances Forney.
dialog: (to arriving late comers)
dialog: Ah, if you could please take your
dialog: seats as quickly as possible that'd be
dialog: great. Thank you.
dialog: (he waits a beat)
dialog: Madeleine was a beloved wife, mother,
dialog: grandmother and friend. And now Mrs
dialog: Agnes Rosowski, a dear friend and
dialog: neighbor, will say a few quick words.
text: 
text: MRS AGNES ROSOWSKI hobbles her way to the microphone.
text: 
speaker_heading: MRS ROSOWSKI
dialog: I did not know Madeleine long enough,
dialog: but from the moment I moved into the
dialog: neighborhood so many years ago, she
dialog: treated me as though I was part of the
dialog: family.

speaker_heading: MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Madeleine always had open arms and
dialog: welcomed friends as kindly as her own.
dialog: She had such a kind wonderful heart.
text: 
text: While Agnes speaks, TJ and Dad notice the funeral director, off
text: to the side, whispering business to two of his employees. He
text: makes every attempt to be subtle and discreet about it, but he
text: is clearly struggling with today's workload.
text: 
speaker_heading: MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: We shared so many wonderful walks and
dialog: enjoyed each other's company very
dialog: much. I will miss our walks. I will
dialog: miss our talks and most of all, I will
dialog: miss Madeleine. I will always remember
dialog: what she told me, life is like
dialog: walking in the rain, you can either
dialog: hide and take shelter or you can just
dialog: get wet. She was dear to me and she
dialog: will always have a place in my heart.
text: 
text: Agnes places her hand on Grandma's coffin and stands for a long
text: silent beat.
text: 
speaker_heading: MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you, Madeleine.
text: 
text: Another drawn out moment of silence. The funeral director takes
text: this opportunity to step to the microphone.
text: 
speaker_heading: FUNERAL DIRECTOR
dialog: OK, thank you, Agnes...
text: 
text: Agnes steps towards her seat. When she sees TJ she stops.
text: 
speaker_heading: MRS ROSOWSKI
dialog: TJ, I think you should say something.
text: 
text: The funeral director pauses awkward. Everyone looks at TJ.
text: 
speaker_heading: MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on, TJ.
text: 
text: TJ gets up reluctantly. He doesn't know what to say. He stands
text: at the microphone and struggles for a long beat, but nothing
text: comes out.
text: 
speaker_heading: TJ
dialog: Sorry.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)

text: 
text: Sound of slow clapping from the back. It's Hesher. His hair
text: looks extra greasy, he's wearing a dirty white Budweiser T-shirt
text: and he's holding a tall can of beer under his arm which spills
text: as he claps. He is VERY drunk.
text: 
text: The funeral director tries to wrap it up.
text: 
speaker_heading: FUNERAL DIRECTOR
dialog: OK, so at this point we should
dialog: conclude today's service with a
dialog: moment's silence, after which lemonade
dialog: will be served in the...
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: Actually, I'd like to add to TJ's
dialog: speech. I think I know where he was
dialog: going with that.
text: 
text: Hesher stands and makes his way to the front. The funeral
text: director tries politely to protest.
text: 
speaker_heading: FUNERAL DIRECTOR
dialog: I'm sorry, sir...
text: 
text: Dad stands up in the aisle and tries to stop Hesher.
text: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: 
text: Up on the stage, funeral home employees begin wheeling Grandma's
dialog: coffin away.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: Hey, hey, hey...
text: 
text: Hesher pushes past Dad and stops the coffin.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing? Get your fuckin'
dialog: hands off that box.
text: 
text: The funeral director walks up to Hesher.
text: 
speaker_heading: FUNERAL DIRECTOR
dialog: I'm sorry, sir we really need to-

text: 
speaker_heading: FUNERAL DIRECTOR
dialog: I'm sorry, sir-
text: 
text: Hesher pushes the funeral director's arm away hard.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: You touch me again, I'll rip your
dialog: fucking head off and skull fuck you.
text: 
text: The funeral director backs off, scared and unsure of what to do.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah, OK. Listen. I know you guys don't
dialog: want me here and I don't want to
dialog: fucking be here, but I'm not here for
dialog: me, I'm fuckin' here for her-
text: 
text: Hesher gestures to Grandma's coffin.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: - and I'm not fuckin' here to say
dialog: goodbye or have my farewell or
dialog: whatever the fuck you assholes call it
dialog: - this is not how I want to say
dialog: goodbye to someone I like - in this
dialog: shit-hole with these-
text: 
text: Hesher points to the funeral director.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: - fuckin' assholes.
text: 
text: TJ's dad stands and interrupts.
text: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: OK, this is enough-
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: Yeah, well why don't you shut up for
dialog: a second and listen cause I'm going to
dialog: say what I want to say and then you'll
dialog: never see me again. Alright?!

dialog: want to listen... so I'm gonna fuckin'
dialog: break it down.
text: 
text: Hesher takes a long pull from his beer can.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I pulled the gas tank from an old
dialog: Chevy and I wanted to fuckin' blow it
dialog: up, so I did. I didn't think about the
dialog: millions of bits of metal that were
dialog: gonna fly in every direction. I almost
dialog: killed myself. I woke up in a
dialog: hospital. I couldn't remember what
dialog: happened and then this doctor at the
dialog: end of my bed said 'son', and I said,
dialog: 'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt',
dialog: then he said, 'you blew off your nut'.
dialog: Some shrapnel had penetrated my left
dialog: scrotal sack and ripped the furry
dialog: sucker right off. My left fucking nut
dialog: was gone, just like that.
text: 
text: Hesher makes a magic disappearing arm gesture, spilling a bit of
text: beer on the floor.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I went crazy. I assaulted a nurse, a
dialog: doctor or two, I can't remember. I got
dialog: arrested. I got sent to juvie. But all
dialog: I could think about day and night was
dialog: my missing fuckin' nut. I couldn't eat
dialog: or sleep, I just wanted my fucking nut
dialog: back. I had to get out of there and
dialog: find it, so I busted out of juvie and
dialog: went lookin' for it. I looked for
dialog: days, but didn't find shit.
text: 
text: The tiny crowd listens, half offended, half intrigued.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: And then one night I was taking a shit
dialog: and I was just staring down at my
dialog: balls, looking at my flabby piece of
dialog: sack where my left nut used to be and
dialog: then I noticed my right nut, for like
dialog: the first time. My right nut was just
dialog: sitting there, totally happy, just
dialog: hanging out.

speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: All this time I'd been driving myself
dialog: crazy thinking about my missing nut
dialog: and not thinking about the nut I still
dialog: had all along. And I realized, I've
dialog: still got a nut. I've still got one
dialog: good nut. God or the Devil or whoever
dialog: left me with one good nut. At least I
dialog: didn't lose both my nuts. I've still
dialog: got one good nut and it works, and my
dialog: dick works too.
text: 
text: Hesher looks up at TJ and Dad, sad and imploring, he's made his
text: point. They look back at him stunned.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You lost your mom. You lost your wife.
dialog: I lost a nut.
text: 
text: Hesher takes the last swig of his Budweiser. He sways, drunk.
text: This soaks in with the crowd.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck this.
text: 
text: Hesher throws the can down. He goes to stomp on it. He misses
text: and stumbles, crashing into the microphone podium, knocking it
text: over and falling in a heap with it. He starts puking on the
text: stage. A couple of old ladies are horrified.
text: 
dialog: The funeral director motions to his assistants that now is the
text: time to move the coffin out. Hesitantly, they obey. Hesher looks
text: over from the floor.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Leave her alone. We're not finished
dialog: yet.
text: 
speaker_heading: FUNERAL DIRECTOR
dialog: (POLITELY)
dialog: Unfortunately sir, we need to be.
text: 
text: They continue to push the coffin away. Hesher lifts himself up
text: and wipes the vomit from his face and steps toward the coffin.
text: The funeral workers back away.
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: I told Grandma I was going on a walk
dialog: with her and I'm gonna do it!
text: 
text: Determined, Hesher leans down and unlocks the wheels of the
dialog: coffin stand.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (6)

speaker_heading: TJ -
text: 
speaker_heading: HESHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You promised Grandma you'd go on a
dialog: walk with her. This is your last
dialog: chance.
text: 
text: Hesher seems overcome with emotion, he continues pushing the
text: coffin toward the exit and out through the doors.
text: 
text: TJ and Dad watch him, unsure. After a moment, They follow him to
text: the door. They stand at the doors watching Hesher push the
text: coffin out into the parking lot.
text: 
text: TJ is overcome with emotion, his eyes well with tears. He heads
text: across the lot and catches up with Hesher, joining him on the
text: walk. Dad watches for a beat, his eyes well up too, then he does
dialog: the same.
text: 
text: All three are now walking together through the funeral home
text: parking lot with Grandma's coffin. They don't speak. It's a
text: release. Other mourners watch from the doorway.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: 
text: Hesher wheels Grandma's coffin across the parking lot with TJ
text: and Dad beside him. They seem solemn and strangely dignified in
text: a dishevelled way.
text: 
text: Hesher leads them out of the parking lot and into the street.
text: Traffic passes around them. Some cars come to a complete stop.
text: 
text: Hesher gets the coffin up onto the sidewalk on the other side of
text: the street and the three continue their silent walk with
dialog: Grandma.
text: 
text: In slow motion the three walk. Dad puts his arm around TJ's
text: shoulders, TJ puts his arm around Dad's.
text: 
text: And then a cop car cruises beside them slow. The cops inside
text: watch them. Dad looks over. One of the cops smiles.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. FORNEY HOUSE - EVENING
text: 
text: The cop car pulls up outside the house. The back door opens and
text: Hesher falls out onto the sidewalk, still very drunk. Dad climbs
text: out and steps over Hesher helping him to his feet. A cop speaks

speaker_heading: HESHER
dialog: Get your hands off me, pig.
text: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: That's the plan.
text: 
text: The cop gives them a casual wave as their car pulls away. TJ and

scene_heading: INT. FORNEY HOUSE / BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING
text: 
dialog: Close on scissors to beard.
text: 
text: Dad stands over the sink cutting away at his beard. Golden

text: 
text: A moment later he lathers his face up with shaving cream.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - MORNING
text: 
text: There's a gentle knock at the door. TJ wakes and makes a big
text: stretch. His hair's a mess.
text: 
speaker_heading: TJ
dialog: Come in.
text: 
text: Dad enters, he's clean-shaven now. He looks like a new man.
text: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Morning, Teej.

speaker_heading: TJ
dialog: Hey. Look at you.

speaker_heading: DAD

scene_heading: EXT. FORNEY HOUSE / GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: 
text: The garage door is open. The garage is flooded with daylight and
text: no sign of Hesher.
text: 
text: TJ and Dad walks across the garage to the open door. At the
text: garage's entrance they stop. Their eyes register something
dialog: seriously unusual outside.
text: 
text: 'Master of Puppets' by Metallica punches in. LOUD.
text: 
text: A giant red cube of Volvo scrap metal has been placed in the
text: center of the driveway like a huge piece of abstract art. They
text: stand and stare at it, almost in awe.
text: 
text: Then from the across the street, we see the object in the
text: driveway and TJ and Dad on the porch looking at it.
text: 
text: We also see the words 'HESHER WAS HERE!' spray painted on the
text: front of the house in big letters, as yet unseen by TJ and Dad.
text: Dad puts his arm around TJ's shoulders.
text: 
text: On the beat we CUT TO:
text: 
text: HESHER MOMENTS:

dialog: Hesher ripping on the guitar; Hesher blowing something up;
dialog: Hesher cupping a fart and putting it in TJ's face; Hesher
dialog: pantsing Dad; Hesher metal saluting Grandma and Grandma saluting
text: him back.
text: 
text: Hesher behind the wheel of his van, smoking a cigarette and
text: making a direct line for the setting sun.
text: 
text: A mouse sits an in a tiny armchair like a human, shelling a
