scene_heading: INT. NASSAU BAND REHEARSAL STUDIO - GEHRING HALL - NIGHT 1
text: A cavernous space. Sound-proofed walls. And in the center, a
text: DRUM SET. Seated at it, in a sweat-marked white T, eyes
text: zeroed on his single-stroke roll, is ANDREW NEIMAN.
text: He’s 19, slight, honors-student-skinny -- except for his
text: arms, which have been built from years and years of drumming.
text: Suddenly -- a MAN enters the practice room. Stopping, rising--
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Sorry... I’m -- I’m sorry--
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: It’s ok. Stay there.
text: The MAN steps forward, removes his coat. He’s tall. Late
dialog: fifties. Black T-shirt, black slacks, black shoes. We’1ll know
text: him as FLETCHER.
text: The room is silent now. And then, softly, as he’s one of
dialog: those people whose whisper can scare the crap out of you--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: What’s your name?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Andrew Neiman, sir.
dialog: (It’s pronounced “Nayman”.)
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: What year are you?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I’m a first-year, sir.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: You know who I am?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: You know what I do?
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 2
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: So you know I’m looking for players.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Then why did you stop playing?
text: Beat. Andrew nods, smiles. He gets it. Summons up all his
text: remaining energy and resumes playing, trying to really show
text: off this time. Rolls, fills, speedy stick-work. He finishes.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Did I say to start playing again?
text: Andrew looks at him.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I thought--
dialog: (then, blanching, )
dialog: I’m sorry, I misun--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I asked you why you stopped playing. Your
dialog: version of an answer was to turn into a
text: wind-up drummer monkey.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I’m sorry -- I--I stopped playing becau--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Show me your rudiments.
text: Andrew nods. Plays one rudiment after another: double-stroke
dialog: roll, paradiddle, ratamacue, flam, flamadiddle.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Uh-huh. Double-time swing.
text: Fletcher begins clapping his hand in time. Fast. Andrew plays.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: No. Double-time. Double it. Bop-bop-bop-
text: bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop.
text: Andrew tries doubling the tempo. But he can’t. Fletcher STOPS
text: CLAPPING. The sign of death.
text: Andrew keeps playing, eyes shut... Then -- he hears the door
text: CLOSE. He stops, and looks up. Fletcher has left the room.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 3
text: A moment later -- the door OPENS. It’s Fletcher. Andrew's
text: eyes widen. Maybe it’s not over...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Woopsy-daisy. Forgot my coat.
text: Fletcher grabs it, steps back out, CLOSES the door. Andrew
text: stares ahead, alone again at the drums -- and totally
text: deflated.
text: It’s over.
text: WIDE SHOT of the band room as Andrew slowly rises. A title card:

scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - SHAFFER CONSERVATORY - NIGHT 2

text: The buildings of midtown New York loom over him like giants --
dialog: immense, forbidding...
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - LOBBY - NIGHT 3
text: A quiet two-screen theater. Andrew buys concessions. The GIRL
text: at the counter is about his age. She’s pretty, but doesn’t
text: really know it. More to the point, she doesn’t seem to care.
text: Her name is NICOLE.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Swedish fish?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Nah, not this time, thanks...
text: Andrew and Nicole exchange smiles. He takes his items --
text: popcorn, Raisinets, two sodas -- and heads off. Peers back at
text: Nicole. She’s staring into space. She looks suddenly lonely.
text: Andrew takes in the sight. You can tell he’s attracted to her
text: -- but he’s too nervous to do anything. A beat later, he
text: enters the theater.
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER 4
text: Andrew spots a 53-year-old man seated near the front. This is
text: his dad -- JIM. Mild-mannered, soft-spoken, average in every
text: respect. Has the eyes of a former dreamer.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013)
text: A smile between the two of them. Andrew hands his dad the
text: Raisinets, hands him the drink. Routine. The movie hasn’t
dialog: started yet. As they exchange items--
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You ok?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Sure...
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: He had me play today.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: Andrew shrugs. It’s clear what that means.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: You still have other options.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It’s good to be open-minded. When I was
dialog: your age I thought I’d have a book deal
dialog: at 23. Then that changed to 30. Then 40.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Right... And that didn’t upset you?
text: Jim shrugs, keeps his eyes down. He has a tendency to look
text: down when talking. The lights dim. The previews begin.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, it has to do something to you.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (another shrug)
dialog: I don’t know. Why? It’s just life.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: There's other things to care about.
dialog: Friends. Romance...
text: Andrew takes it in. Especially the last part.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: At my age you get perspective.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I don’t want perspective.
speaker_heading: Pink (9/10/2013) 4a
text: Jim smiles. A moment.
text: Just then a MOVIEGOER squeezes into the row to head to a
text: seat further down -- and bumps against Jim and his bucket

speaker_heading: JIM NEYMAN
dialog: Sorry.

text: Rusty elevator doors squeak open. Andrew steps out -- into a

dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 6
text: Dim lights, loud MUSIC blaring from behind a door. A thudding
dialog: party beat...
text: At the end of the hall -- where the music is coming from -- a
text: few PARTYGOERS mingle by a door. The door opens. A YOUNG MAN
text: hands a SECOND YOUNG MAN a wad of cash in exchange for a Zip-
text: lock bag of PILLS. The SECOND YOUNG MAN eyes Andrew.
text: Andrew turns away, heads left -- to his own door. Hurriedly
text: opens it and slips inside.
scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY - ANDREW’S ROOM - NIGHT 7
text: A single. Drumsticks and drum pads scattered, biographies of
text: Bach and Coltrane on the shelf, posters of Louis Armstrong
text: and Charlie Parker on the walls. A TV is on, some sort of
text: music documentary. Andrew watches from his bed -- as, over
text: OLD AUDIO OF DRUMMING and old stills of a boy at a drum set --
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
text: By the age of ten, Traps the Boy Wonder
dialog: was wowing crowds all over America. By
text: his teens, Buddy Rich was well on his way
dialog: to becoming the stuff of legend.
scene_heading: TALKING HEAD #1
dialog: Like any truly great player, Buddy seemed
dialog: to have been born with music in his
text: blood. He grasped it intuitively, ina
dialog: way you and I just can't.
scene_heading: TALKING HEAD #2
dialog: You check out the old stuff, man. You look
dialog: at those movies when he was a kid, his
dialog: arms...
dialog: Beat. Andrew takes it all in -- especially these words:
speaker_heading: TALKING HEAD #2 (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: You just can't teach that. That kind of
dialog: genius.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You either got it or you don't.
text: Andrew turns off the TV. We hear the party beat continuing
text: outside, muffled. He leans back and switches off his light.
speaker_heading: WE FADE OUT.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 7
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - NASSAU BAND ROOM - DAY 8
dialog: The same room we saw Andrew practicing in at night -- only now
text: it’s full of musicians. Mostly male, mostly first- and second-
text: years. This is NASSAU BAND, one of Shaffer’s lower-level jazz
text: ensembles. Because it’s Shaffer, the players are still first-
dialog: rate. A few third-years are here, too -- including a red-head
text: drummer with the body of a linebacker. RYAN CONNOLLY.
text: Andrew looks up -- in time to see Ryan with a GIRL by the
text: doorway. Ryan’s girlfriend is gorgeous -- tall, all curves.
text: Ryan lets his hand slide down her shoulder. Andrew watches...
text: The GIRL waves bye to Ryan as he heads in. He’s all macho
dialog: confidence.
speaker_heading: TRUMPETER
dialog: My man Ry! Shit, how you feeling?
speaker_heading: RYAN
text: Stitched up at last, dude.
speaker_heading: TRUMPETER
dialog: Things were hurting with Neiman on the kit--
text: Ryan taps him to stop. Andrew is within earshot -- and has
text: heard. Beat. Ryan moves over to Andrew, sits down at the set.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You have a good weekend, bro?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah. Definitely. Really good.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Don’t worry about Greg. He’s a dick.
text: Andrew nods. Admires Ryan. Seems more diminutive now than ever.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You been practicing?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah. All the time.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: My man.
text: Then -- the Nassau Band conductor appears: RON KRAMER.
speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER
text: Morning, fellas. “Billie’s In”, bar 8.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 8
text: Mr. Kramer CLAPS OFF in time -- and the band begins playing
scene_heading: FIRST NASSAU BAND REHEARSAL CHART. Mid-tempo. Ryan’s
text: confident, in control. Andrew turns his pages, watches...
speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER (CONT’D)
text: Nice, Ryan... Woah, trumpets.
speaker_heading: TRUMPETER #2
dialog: Yeah, yeah - sorry about that one.
speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER
dialog: Just brass again.
text: To Ryan’s left, a whisper--
speaker_heading: TRUMPETER
dialog: Ry...
text: Ryan turns. Visible as a silhouette through the frosted glass
text: of the main door...is FLETCHER. Andrew turns and looks as
text: well. Tenses up.

text: Rehearsal has ended. The MUSICIANS have just filed out --

speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER
dialog: Are you learning from Ryan?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah... He’s been great to me.
speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER
dialog: Last week was a little overwhelming for you?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (is that a question?)
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: (then, hesitant, )
dialog: I wonder...what you think about my progress?
speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER
dialog: Your progress?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I just... I’m...practicing hard and...
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013)
speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER
dialog: Andrew -- you’ve got a good attitude. You

text: Andrew nods. Waiting.
speaker_heading: 8A
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013)
speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER (CONT’D)
dialog: Yeah. Ok?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ok... Do you think... I know Fletcher's
dialog: looking for players...for Studio Band...
speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER
dialog: Yeah, Andrew... Lincoln Center looks out
dialog: for Fletcher's top players. If it weren’t
dialog: for Ryan’s injury he’d have been in Studio
dialog: Band last year. He’s a natural player.
text: Andrew takes this in. Nods.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: ok.
speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER
dialog: (this is awkward)
dialog: Look... I’m going to be candid. 90% of
dialog: our players will never make it into the
dialog: Lincoln Centers or the Collectives. The
dialog: question is -- who’s in that 10%?
speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER (CONT’D)
dialog: So I'd practice. You could start a rock
dialog: band.
text: Andrew takes it in. The implication is clear.
text: He turns -- and glimpses a poster on the wall: a DRUMMER
text: throwing a stick in the air mid-solo. Buff. Confident. The
text: opposite of him.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I...I have one more question...

speaker_heading: STUDENT #1 **
dialog: At least you didn’t embarrass yourself aK
dialog: like what’s-his-face. **
speaker_heading: STUDENT #2 **
dialog: That was truly pathetic. aK
text: As he continues walking, he hears music. Stops. Approaches. **
dialog: Looks.
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - CONTINUOUS 11A
text: Through the pane of glass, Andrew can see a FULL ORCHESTRA.
text: Everyone looks older than in Nassau. More focused. All eyes
text: glued on Fletcher as he assumes his position...
text: Fletcher’s right arm moves, just a hair, and the band starts:
text: fast, dazzling. Andrew watches -- in awe. The band’s playing
text: STUDIO BAND EAVESDROP CHART, and the sound is so full, so
dialog: precise, so commanding. Nothing like Nassau.
text: And suddenly -- Fletcher TURNS AROUND. His eyes meet Andrew’s.
text: Andrew ducks out of view -- shit --
text: -- and hurries away.
scene_heading: INT. ANDREW'S PRACTICE ROOM - A FEW HOURS LATER 12
text: Andrew practices like mad, trying to nail a double-time swing.
text: To his left a digital METRONOME blinks. The time set: 380.
text: Andrew stops. Resets the metronome. 390. Resumes playing.
text: Tries to keep up. Resets the metronome to 400. Can’t keep up
text: at all now. Struggling, sweating, hands blistering, when --
text: CRAAACK. Andrew's right drumstick SNAPS IN HALF.
text: He stops. Spent. Looks at his hand, sweating and throbbing from
text: the blisters.
text: Looks back at the metronome. Still beeping away. He turns it off.
text: Glances up ahead at a poster -- of BUDDY RICH hunched over a drum
speaker_heading: Pink (9/10/2013) 10A
text: kit, mid-solo -- tacked to the wall.
text: Stares at the image. Then looks down -- at the PAPERWORK we

text: Andrew skips ahead to the third track. Immediately, drums
text: start. Another double-time swing. Only this one is insanely
text: fast. Even faster than Andrew was going.
text: Andrew listens. Looks at his drum kit. Thinks. Makes a decision.
text: Turns the CD off.
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - LOBBY - AFTERNOON 13
text: The same movie theater as before. Andrew marches in. Has one
text: goal and one goal only now.
text: Walks up to Nicole at the counter. Takes a deep breath, and--
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hey -- look -- I -- I don’t know how to
dialog: say this -- I see you in here all the
dialog: time and -- I was just wondering --
dialog: (stops, collects himself, )
dialog: -- if you'd want to get a bite to eat
dialog: with me.
text: Beat. Nicole just looks at him. Andrew can’t believe he said what

text: BLACK. We hear knocking.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (0.S.)

dialog: and as well-dressed -- as ever.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey, Andrew! I guess Sophie found you?
text: Andrew is taken aback. Fletcher remembers his first name?
speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: I like to chat with students coming in

text: Andrew looks surprised by the warmth in Fletcher’s voice.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes. Transferring. To Columbia.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Terrific. Columbia’s a terrific school.
dialog: Did something precipitate this?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I just decided to...
dialog: (not sure how to say it)

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Bravo.

dialog: toward his desk--)
text: Too many students clamp down on their

dialog: Hobbies they picked up in their teens,
dialog: and for what? Take a seat.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (starts heading to a couch)

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: What were you then? Twelve?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Six.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Oh. Well, kids start swimming when they’re
dialog: six, doesn’t mean they’re Michael Phelps.
dialog: It’s a hobby, never anything you consider
dialog: going all the way with. Am I right?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Definitely. I mean -- well -- for a time,
dialog: I thought I’d go all the way -- but, yeah--
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 14
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Well, kids want anything. I wanted to be
dialog: a nanny. Thank God those I trusted talked
dialog: me out of it. Good to listen to advice.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes, I’ve done that, you’re right, it’s--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: --good to get outside perspectives. So
dialog: long as they don’t have ulterior motives,
dialog: I’'d listen to what the people you trust
dialog: tell you.
text: Andrew nods. But that phrase seems to echo. Ulterior motives...
text: Fletcher hops down from the desk and makes his way to the
dialog: couch.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: So what's the passion you've chosen to
dialog: pursue at Columbia, then?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
text: (as Fletcher takes a seat next to
dialog: him)
dialog: Oh... Well... I’m not...not really sure.
dialog: It’s not a specific thing I have in mind.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Ah. Well that’s ok. You’re young. Most
dialog: people, it takes years for them to find
dialog: their calling. My father, for instance --
dialog: he had no idea what he wanted at your age.
dialog: He tried a lot of things, a little bit of
dialog: this, a little bit of that. Took him years
dialog: before he realized his dream was
dialog: insurance. That was his passion. The
text: cubicle, the coffee breaks, the dry wall.
text: He lets this simmer for a beat. Then--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m sure you'll find your calling as well.
text: He rises back up. A moment of silence.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: I guess that’s it, then. Any questions?
text: He notices Andrew looking at a photo on the wall.
dialog: He takes

dialog: drift to
dialog: walls...
speaker_heading: JVC Jazz

speaker_heading: ANDREW
text: (trying to collect his thoughts
dialog: as he rises)
dialog: +..SO -- are you -- still looking for
dialog: Studio Band players then...?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: (turning around to face Andrew)
dialog: Some, yes. But it’s no cakewalk. Most kids
dialog: here can’t last. Laszlo Polgar, Hungarian
dialog: psychologist, declares in 1967 that talent
dialog: is all about conditioning. Says he can make
dialog: his kids, whoever they are, the best in the
dialog: world at something. What that something is
dialog: he'll decide. He’s a lousy chess player but
dialog: he picks chess because it’s objective. Goes
text: around looking for a wife, finds one who
text: agrees to his experiment. Starts having
text: kids: Susan, Sofia and Judit. Gets them
dialog: practicing before they can even talk. These
dialog: weren’t kids who were sitting and smelling
dialog: the roses. These were kids who were going
dialog: to leave an actual mark on the world. Who
dialog: was the top female player by 1984? Susan.
dialog: Who played the eight-straight-wins “Miracle
dialog: of Rome” in 1989? Sofia. And who is
dialog: universally considered the greatest female
dialog: chess player of all time? Judit.
text: a breath. Smiles. We linger for a second on Andrew,
text: in place, taking it all in. Andrew’s eyes quickly
dialog: the photos behind Fletcher -- the images on the
text: The Studio Band with Wynton Marsalis. Fletcher at the
text: Festival. One jazz luminary after another...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Which is why I’m sure you’1l be great at
dialog: whatever you set your mind to at Columbia.
text: (puts his arm around Andrew, starts

dialog: It was a pleasure chatting, Andrew, now--
speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 16
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Well that’s worrisome. I’m sure you had
dialog: good reason to make your decision.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I -- just might give it some more time--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: No need to do that. First instincts are best.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: My first instinct...is not to transfer...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I’m not sure your first instinct is
dialog: right, then. Why don’t you give it some
dialog: more thought, and in the meantime...
text: (reaches the door; about to close--)
dialog: ---make sure your double-time swing is

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Dude -- what’ve you been practicing?
text: Just then, the DOOR SWINGS OPEN -- and in steps FLETCHER. All

text: Fletcher’s footsteps. Andrew waits. Heart pounding...
text: Fletcher arrives at the head of the band -- as Kramer silently
text: and meekly retreats. Fletcher props up the music stand to his
text: height, looks down at the sheet music, runs his finger down it
dialog: to find the spot he wants... Andrew, like all the other
text: players, is dead-still, eyes glued on Fletcher’s every move...

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Next. One-two--
text: (the SECOND TRUMPETER misses

dialog: Next. One-two--
text: Nothing. Fletcher looks up. There are no more trumpeters. He

dialog: Trombone. Bars 21 to 23. Four-and--

dialog: Saxes. 48 to 50. “And” of one. And-one--

dialog: Next--
text: Before he even counts off, he notices the TENOR SAX’s
text: fingering -- all he needs to know.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Drums.
text: We get a split-second glimpse of the TENOR SAXOPHONIST,
text: wondering what just happened -- before we CUT to the drums,
text: Ryan at the ready.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Double-time swing.
text: Ryan takes a breath. Fletcher CLAPS him off. Ryan plays.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Thank you. You. Behind.
text: Palms sweaty, Andrew takes Ryan’s place. Trains his eyes on
text: Fletcher’s hands. Deep breath. Fletcher CLAPS, and Andrew begins
text: -- trying to get the motion right, trying to stay in time--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Thank you. Bass. Five bars of “Donna
dialog: Lee”.
text: We STAY ON Andrew as the BASSIST plays; Andrew slides off the

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: (to Bassist)
dialog: Thank you.
text: We CUT back to Fletcher. He looks over the band once more. We
text: see the MUSICIANS’ faces -- scared, but hopeful. Then--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Drums. Come with me.
text: Ryan’s heart starts speeding. His excitement visible, he--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Other drums.
text: Ryan freezes. Andrew is stuck in place for a moment. Then,
text: eyes wide -- is this really happening? -- he rises and
text: approaches the doorway... There, Fletcher hands him an ORANGE
speaker_heading: PAPER SLIP.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Give this to Admin for rescheduling. We
dialog: meet 6am to lpm every day. Room B16.
text: And with that, he EXITS.
text: In a daze, Andrew drifts back toward the band. Kramer looks at
text: him. Andrew answers the look with a defiant smile. Vindicated.
speaker_heading: MR. KRAMER
dialog: Ok fellas, let’s...let’s take it back from
dialog: the top..
text: He claps off. The band plays SECOND NASSAU BAND REHEARSAL CHART
text: (RYAN). Andrew pretends not to notice Ryan’s eyeing him in
text: shock. Just sits down, lets it all settle.
text: And -- ever so slowly -- Andrew's face dissolves into a GRIN...
scene_heading: INT. PIZZERIA - NIGHT 17
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: This is a nice place.
text: We're at a cheap pizzeria now. Nicole is seated, two half-
text: eaten slices of pepperoni in front of her. An old jazz track
text: is playing -- PIZZERIA CHART.
text: Seated across from Nicole is Andrew -- echoes of the earlier
text: grin still on his face, a brightness in his eyes.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah, I come here a lot.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 19
dialog: Beat. Then -- clicking back to reality -- this is not a nice
dialog: place, did I fuck up? --
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: They have good music, so I -- it’s not
dialog: just the food...
dialog: (points, re: the tune)
dialog: This is Jackie Hill, “When I Wake”, July
dialog: 17th, 1938, Bob Ellis on drums.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Are you trying to impress me?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No -- sorry -- I didn’t mean -- they have
dialog: like -- ten songs they loop through.
dialog: They’re always playing the same thing.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: And you know the dates to all ten?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: ...Yeah.
text: Nicole smiles. A moment. Andrew fidgets. Nervous.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You know every time I saw you in the
dialog: theater you always had your eyes pointed
text: to the floor.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Like you were fascinated by the soda
text: stains on the carpet.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: My dad tells me I have a problem making
text: eye contact.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: My parents like to criticize me too. When
dialog: I was growing up my mom told me my chin
dialog: was too big and that that’s why guys
dialog: wouldn’t like me. ‘Cause my dad had
dialog: cursed me with a big chin.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What?
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 20
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Yeah, it’s -- look --
text: (she turns, points her chin up)
dialog: It’s Jay Leno.
text: Andrew laughs. Nicole looks prettier to him than ever.
speaker_heading: NICOLE (CONT'D)
dialog: She keeps asking me if I have a boyfriend
text: yet, and then blames it on the chin.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: She sounds insane.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: She wanted to be an actress when she was
dialog: my age.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: And you? What do you do?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Other than serving you popcorn?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What do you want to do with your life?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: (thinks; wasn’t prepared for
dialog: a question that direct)
dialog: I go to Fordham... I’m not sure...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What’s your major?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I don’t have one yet.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well what did you come here to study?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I just came here for a general education.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Right, but you picked Fordham for a
dialog: reason. Why Fordham?
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 21
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I applied to a bunch of schools, Fordham
dialog: let me in. Why’d you pick Shaffer?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's the best music school in the country.
text: Beat. Nicole shrugs.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Well Fordham was Fordham.
text: A moment.
speaker_heading: NICOLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t love it there to be honest...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I mean -- the people there... I don’t
dialog: think they like me. I’m from Arizona and --
dialog: I don’t know, I think they see it in me.
text: A beat. Andrew thinks about this, then--
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I don’t like the people at Shaffer
dialog: either. But I think it just takes time...
dialog: Things change, you know.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I know.
dialog: (then, opening up more than
dialog: she expected, more fragility
dialog: in her voice now)
dialog: I feel homesick sometimes. You know? I
dialog: hate how people in college pretend they
dialog: never feel homesick. Or maybe I’m
dialog: literally the only one, but... I don’t
dialog: think so.
text: A moment of silence. She looks at Andrew. He looks at her.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I know exactly how you feel.
dialog: (then, he smiles)
dialog: I still go to the movies with my dad.
text: Nicole nods. Smiles back. Andrew said it playfully, but she

speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: .-.I like this song.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah -- this part is great -- here --
text: Nicole smiles. Looks at Andrew. He looks back. Their knees

text: And, on this moment, just as the song ends --
scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY - ANDREW’S ROOM - PRE-DAWN 18
text: Andrew's in bed -- fast asleep. Seems stress-free for once --
text: his body totally relaxed, his mind deep in a dream. His arm

scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 18A

scene_heading: EXT. DORMITORY - NEW YORK STREET - MOMENTS LATER 19

text: the city cold and menacing.
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS 20
text: Andrew busts inside, runs down the STAIRWELL -- and SLIPS.
text: Falls full-throttle down a whole flight, hands smacking
text: against the tile. Rises, sore, and keeps running.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - BASEMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 20A

scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - CONTINUOUS 20B

dialog: the time on his phone: 5:33. Did he miss them...?
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - BASEMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 20C
text: Andrew steps back into the hallway. Spots a SIGN-UP SHEET at
text: the door. Looks at it. Sees the words “STUDIO BAND” scrolled
dialog: down for each day. The listed start-time: “9AM”.
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - MORNING 21
text: Andrew sits on the drum throne. A clock on the wall reads:
text: 8:57. He’s dozed off, is out cold. His hand, cut from his fall
text: down the stairs, rests against the snare drum.
text: Suddenly -- the DOOR opens --
speaker_heading: SAXOPHONIST #2
dialog: She told me to pull out, then wet the
dialog: whole fucking bed.
speaker_heading: SAXOPHONIST
dialog: No, serious??
text: Andrew shoots up. Surges to his feet. The SAXOPHONISTS don’t pay
text: him any attention. They’re big guys, macho. Another DOOR opens.
scene_heading: MORE PLAYERS...
text: These are the CORE MEMBERS of Studio Band -- Shaffer’s cream
dialog: of the crop. Mostly third- and fourth-years. All male. A few
text: ALTERNATES follow, first- and second-years.
text: Andrew watches as the PLAYERS buzz their mouthpieces, whip
text: open their folders, pull out their instruments. A flurry of
text: chatter and activity...
text: One of the CORE MEMBERS heads to the drums: CARL TANNER, 22.
text: Andrew sees him, and--
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You the new alternate?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah -- I’m -- Andrew Neiman...
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (couldn't care less about his name)
dialog: Tune the set to a B-flat. Then you’ll
dialog: turn my pages during rehearsal.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 24
text: Andrew, nervous, sits back down at the drums and--
speaker_heading: ANDREW
speaker_heading: (to the PIANIST)
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Um -- sorry -- excuse me?
dialog: (the Pianist looks at him)
dialog: Could I have a B-flat please?
text: The Pianist plays a B-flat. Andrew tunes. By now the room is
scene_heading: filled: TRUMPETS, TROMBONES, SAXES.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)

dialog: Excuse me -- could I maybe have ano--
text: But Carl has already risen. Ushers Andrew back up. Sits down at
text: the drums, as Andrew sits down by the music stand.
speaker_heading: SAXOPHONIST #2
dialog: Milk the cunt!!
text: The PIANIST plays a middle C, and the players start tuning to
dialog: it.
text: Andrew watches, listens -- the sea of sounds building, the clock
text: on the wall ticking, until -- it hits 9:00.
text: THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN. Fletcher marches in, carrying a stack
text: of sheet music. Sudden tension -- and utter silence.
text: Fletcher sets his music down. Stares at the band. Dead-serious,
text: silently judging. A moment passes...
text: Then -- he SMILES. He’s switched all of a sudden to warm and
dialog: cuddly.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: We’ve got a squeaker today, people.
dialog: Neiman.
dialog: (he pronounces it “Neeman”)
dialog: Nineteen years old. Isn't he cute?
text: Laughs throughout the room. We can overhear a few snickers:
speaker_heading: PLAYERS (0.S.)
dialog: Neee-man...
text: Andrew looks. Fletcher keeps his smile up... And then--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Alright, gang. “Whiplash”.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 25
text: The players get out the chart. Andrew catches a glimpse --
text: a messy clutter of notes and time signatures...
text: Fletcher raises his hand. Total silence. Then -- the
text: slightest move of Fletcher's finger, and the band begins
scene_heading: WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL CARL #1. The chart’s named
text: “Whiplash” for a reason. It’s fast, frenetic, 7/4 time. This
text: fast, with this many polyrhythms, it’s impossibly hard.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Page... Page...
text: Andrew turns the page. Carl glares. Shouldn’t have had to tell
text: him to turn it. But Andrew can’t follow. The band’s too fast..
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Stop. You. Barker.
text: (pointing to the THIRD
speaker_heading: TRUMPETER’S horn)
dialog: That is not your boyfriend’s dick. Do not
text: come early. Moving ahead. Bar 93.
dialog: 
text: The players flip their sheet music. Andrew catches a glimpse
text: of a TROMBONIST ejecting the spit from his horn. A puddle has
text: formed by his feet.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Five-six-seven--
text: The band plays WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL CARL #2.
text: Intense, visceral. Fletcher paces back and forth, eyeing
text: players as they play. He’s got fox’s ears, hawk’s eyes. Every
text: sinew of his body is focused. Andrew watches, awed, scared,
text: completely overwhelmed.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop!
text: The band comes to a halt.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Now this one upsets me. We have an out-of-
dialog: tune player. Before I go any further, does
dialog: that player want to do the right thing and
dialog: reveal himself?
dialog: (silence)
text: Ok. Maybe a bug flew in my ear. Bar 115.
dialog: Five-six-and--
text: He cues the BAND with his hand, then cuts them off.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 26
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: No, I guess my ears are clean because we
dialog: most definitely have an out-of-tune
dialog: player. Whoever it is, this is your last
dialog: chance.
dialog: (paces back and forth, slowly)
dialog: Either you know you are out of tune, and
dialog: are therefore deliberately sabotaging my
dialog: band; or you do not know you’re out of
dialog: tune -- which I’m afraid is even worse.
text: Nothing. The players avert his gaze. All terrified...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Reeds. Five-six-and--
dialog: (they play, he cuts them off)
dialog: Bones. Five-six-and--
dialog: (they play, he cuts them off)
dialog: Ahhhh, he’s here.
text: Silence. He eyes the TROMBONISTS. Lands on one, METZ. Overweight.
dialog: Been picked on his whole life.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Tell me it’s not you, Elmer Fudd.
text: Metz sits there, trembling. On the brink of tears.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s ok. Play.
dialog: (Metz does so, Fletcher stops
text: him, leans in, whispers--)
dialog: Do you think you’re out of tune?
text: Metz, terrified, looks down at the floor.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: There’s no fucking Mars Bar down there.
dialog: Look at me. Do you think you're out of
dialog: tune?
speaker_heading: METZ
dialog: -..Y--yes...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Then why the FUCK didn’t you say so?!?
text: Silence. It’s the first time we’ve heard Fletcher really SHOUT.
text: His voice is booming, louder than one would have thought. Then--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: I’ve been carrying your fat ass for too
dialog: long, Metz.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 22
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 27
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: I will not let you cost us a competition
dialog: because your mind’s on a fucking Happy
dialog: Meal and not on pitch. Stein,
dialog: congratulations, you are now fourth-chair
dialog: trombone. Metz -- get the fuck out.
text: Still trembling, tears bubbling out, Metz picks up his
text: trombone and walks to the door. Andrew watches -- shocked.
dialog: Once the door closes--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: For the record, Metz was not out of tune.
dialog: You were, Wallach. But Metz didn’t know
dialog: it. And that’s bad enough.
dialog: 
text: And then -- he looks straight at Andrew.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Alright, take ten. When we get back --
text: the squeaker’s on.
text: Andrew's face goes ghost-white.
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - BASEMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 22
text: Andrew sits in the corner of the hall, the “WHIPLASH” sheet
text: music in his hand. Tries desperately to count the beats...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Five-six-seven... Six-two-two-five...
text: He scribbles on the page, trying to compute the patterns: “7/9
text: + 7/4 = 7/18". “1/64 X 7/9"... We see feet pass by, and hear--
scene_heading: STUDIO CORE MEMBER #1
dialog: Stein won’t last a week. He doesn’t have
dialog: the lips.
scene_heading: STUDIO CORE MEMBER #2
dialog: Fudd lasted longer than he should have...
scene_heading: STUDIO CORE MEMBER #3
dialog: Maybe if he spent half the time
text: practicing that he does to polishing off
dialog: cheeseburgers...
scene_heading: STUDIO CORE MEMBER #4
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You got that right.
text: Andrew's eyes follow the PLAYERS. They’re tall, built. Next

dialog: back to the warm tone he displayed days ago --
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: (walking Andrew down the hall)

dialog: Besides, you’re no Elmer Fudd. This is a

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Your parents musicians?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No, not really...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: What do they do?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well, my dad’s a writer.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: What's he written?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well he’s...I guess he’s mainly a

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: College?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Pennington High.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: And your mom?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I don’t know... She left when I was a
dialog: baby.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: So no musicians in the family.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: ...-No, I guess not...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Well, you’ve just got to listen to the

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)

text: He pats Andrew on the back -- then promptly walks off.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO BAND ROOM - GEHRING HALL - MOMENTS LATER 23
text: The players are taking their seats. Slowly, Andrew walks in.
text: Eyes the DRUMS. Takes a deep breath. He can do this...
text: Carl is seated in the alternate’s seat. The drum throne is
text: empty. Just waiting for Andrew...
text: Andrew sits down. WE MOVE IN CLOSER ON HIM -- as he adjusts
text: his seat, lays his music out, gets his sticks ready...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (0.S.)
dialog: Alright, gang.
text: Andrew looks up. Fletcher has just entered.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)

text: Fletcher eyes Andrew.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Neiman -- just do your best.
text: Andrew nods. Looks at the music. Counts in his head. He's
dialog: ready...
text: Fletcher CLAPS the band off. WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL
text: ANDREW #1, mid-tempo, far easier than before. Andrew’s doing
text: well. Fletcher nods, smiles--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Let’s see some fills.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 30
text: Andrew fills, rolling down the toms. Fletcher grins.
text: Andrew, seeing Fletcher's grin, can’t help but smile. Getting
text: into it now. The whole BAND building, his drumming growing more
text: intense. He fills again.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Snap! We've got Buddy Rich here.
text: Andrew grins. Fills again. Accenting, playing a counter-rhythm.
text: When he trips up. Comes in a hair late.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: (waving the band to stop)
dialog: Ok, little trouble there. No problem.
dialog: Let’s pick it up from 17.
text: Fletcher claps. Andrew plays WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND
text: REHEARSAL ANDREW #2. Fletcher waves him to stop again.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Not my tempo. Ok?
text: Fletcher claps again. Then another wave for Andrew to stop.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Downbeat on 18. Ok?
text: He’s still soft, calm, warm. He claps again. Then, stopping--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: The “and” of 4. Bar 17, the “and” of 4.
text: He claps off. Stops Andrew again, only seconds later.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: 17, the “and” of 4. Ok? And you're
dialog: rushing a little...
text: Andrew nods. Getting nervous now... Fletcher claps again. Stops
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Not quite my tempo. All good, here we go.
text: He’s about to clap off when, out of nerves, Andrew hits his
text: bass drum early.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: No -- ready?
text: Fletcher claps. Stops Andrew yet again.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 31
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Sorry, you’re -- you’re dragging a little

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
text: Dragging.
text: Claps again. Andrew plays WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL
text: ANDREW #3, expecting another stop -- but it doesn’t come.
text: Fletcher nods, as though now satisfied, then slowly turns

text: about to sit down, when...
text: like a flash of lightning he WHIPS up the chair and HURLS
text: it straight at Andrew’s head.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Andrew DUCKS, as the chair CATCHES the top of the bass drum,

text: Then -- total silence in the room. Andrew is shell-shocked,
dialog: beyond shaken, what in the fuck just happened???...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: FLETCHER

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Carl...
text: Carl silently switches places with Andrew at the set.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Start practicing harder, Neiman.
dialog: (then, turning to the band,)
text: “Whiplash”. Once more from the top.
text: He claps the band off. As for Andrew, he just sits behind Carl --

text: His first day of Studio Band is over.
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY 24
text: Andrew exits. Trying to hold it all in. Then--
speaker_heading: RYAN

text: Then, his PHONE rings. He looks at it. Hesitates...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: ..-Hello...?
speaker_heading: JIM (0.S.)
dialog: You didn't show.
text: And, finally, breaking down, can’t hold it in any longer--
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: He ripped me apart...
speaker_heading: JIM (0.S.)
dialog: ...Who?
dialog: (then, )
dialog: That asshole? You told me you were
dialog: transferring...
text: Andrew looks at his desk. There, atop a pile of papers, is

text: to it, a BUDDY RICH CD...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: --.I thought he liked my playing.
speaker_heading: JIM (0.S.)
dialog: Who cares what he likes? Who is he to you?
dialog: When I started writing plenty of people
dialog: tried to put me down. You ignore them.
dialog: Andrew is silent. When I started writing...

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: When you started writing...
speaker_heading: JIM (0.S.)
dialog: Why don't you come home tonight?
speaker_heading: ANDREW

scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - FLETCHER’S OFFICE 26DAY

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I’m sorry to interrupt you. I just want to
dialog: tell you -- I’m so thankful to have been
dialog: accepted into Studio Band. And I’m going to
dialog: make sure I don’t disappoint you.
text: Fletcher, seated at his desk, just looks at Andrew. Andrew
text: nods, turns around. Marches back down the hall -- as PERCUSSION
text: begins... WE FOLLOW HIM, sticking close to his face, the
text: resolve now in his eyes. Something has changed.
text: PERCUSSION grows louder and, as we move, hurdles us back...
text: ...to FLETCHER’S OFFICE. And to Fletcher, peeking out
text: through his doorway now. Fletcher smiles...
scene_heading: INT. ANDREW’S PRACTICE ROOM - DAY 27

text: And just like that, moving fast, DRUM PATTERN FOR MONTAGE
dialog: carrying us, we’re--
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL OFFICE ROOM - DAY 28

scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - SHAFFER CONSERVATORY - EVENING 29
text: Fletcher steps outside. It’s drizzling a bit. He slowly unfolds
text: an umbrella. Passes by a few other FACULTY MEMBERS on his way
text: to the sidewalk. Keeps walking. The DRUMMING continues...
scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY - ANDREW’S ROOM - EVENING 30
text: Andrew pulls the MATTRESS off his bed, drags it to the door
text: with his ALARM CLOCK. Heaves both out to the hallway...
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 31
text: Fletcher is seated, squished in between commuters, towered
text: over by other travelers. Looks diminutive in this setting...
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK SIDE STREET - NIGHT 32
text: Andrew marches down a side-street, wolfing down a McDonald's
text: burger for dinner, earphones plugged into a METRONOME...
scene_heading: INT. ANDREW'S PRACTICE ROOM - NIGHT 33
text: Andrew lifts a 50-lb weight with his right arm. Then a 75-lb.
text: Then picks his stick up and plays his double-time swing...
scene_heading: EXT. FLETCHER’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 34
text: Fletcher reaches a nondescript high-rise. With his folded-up
text: umbrella, his head hanging low, and the careful delicacy with
text: which he opens the door, he looks here like nothing so much
dialog: as a quiet, everyday man...
scene_heading: INT. ANDREW'S PRACTICE ROOM - NIGHT 35
text: Andrew sleeps, earphones still in and metronome still on.
text: He’s on the MATTRESS he brought down from his dorm, the ALARM
text: CLOCK by his side. Next to it, a suitcase of clothes. Above,
text: the poster of Buddy Rich. It’s as though he’s moved in.
scene_heading: INT. FLETCHER’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 36
text: Fletcher sets the table for dinner. He has nice porcelain
text: plates, and a glass of red wine. But the meal? A frozen ready-
text: made steak and vegetables. On the wall, a photo. In it, a
text: younger Fletcher, and a WOMAN, and a NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL. All

dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 39
scene_heading: INT. ANDREW’S PRACTICE ROOM - MORNING 37
text: Andrew rises from the same mattress and slides onto his drum
text: seat. Starts playing, hands dotted with blisters, eyes crusty
text: with sand. The METRONOME still on...
dialog: ...because it was never turned off.
text: CUT TO: Rides furiously, trying to beat his double-time
text: swing... The METRONOME reading 380... His muscles exhausted...
text: CUT TO: The METRONOME adjusted up to 390... Blisters tearing...
text: cuT TO: 400.. Hands bleeding now, blood smearing the sticks...
text: CUT TO: 405... The METRONOME going crazy now... The DRUMMING so
text: fast it’s a wash, a wall of sound, blood on the cymbal--
scene_heading: INT. FLETCHER’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 38
text: Silence. Fletcher finishes his meal. Puts the dishes away. Sits
text: down on a couch. Still alone.
text: The apartment, like his office, is small but elegant. Pictures
text: of icons on the walls. Monk. Holiday. Coltrane...
text: Fletcher reaches into a stack of LP’s: Chopin, Ravel... Pulls
text: one out with the most delicate touch, as though he were
text: handling a newborn. Sets it on a record player by his side.
text: A scratch, a hiss, and then --
text: -- FLETCHER’S SONG. Melancholy, lovelorn...
text: Fletcher just sits and listens, barely moves -- but you can
text: tell the music now playing means everything to him...
dialog: A moment, and then...
scene_heading: INT. DUNELLEN AUDITORIUM - STAGE - EVENING 39

speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN (0.S.)
dialog: Terry!
text: Andrew turns, glimpses a CORRIDOR through the doorway. Out in
text: the corridor, he sees a TECHNICIAN welcome Fletcher. In the
text: Technician’s arms, a FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL -- the Technician’s
dialog: daughter --
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Mike!
dialog: (and, to the girl,)
dialog: I’m so sorry, can I have your autograph?
text: (she blushes, shakes her head)

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Ooo, I need pianists!

text: The Technician smiles again, looks at the girl. She hides her

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Alright, alright.
dialog: (looking up at her dad)
dialog: Great to see you, Mike.
text: He leans in. They hug.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: See you after the show! Cheers!
text: He steps in, closes the door and addresses his PLAYERS, who

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Ok, you fucking cocksuckers. E Dorian.

dialog: Rhythm and soloists, we're augmenting the

dialog: sharp the nine at bar 106. Got it?

dialog: Now remember. Lincoln Center and its ilk

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: (almost matter-of-fact)
dialog: Get the fuck out of my sight before I

text: The STAGE HAND nods, slinks away. Fletcher addresses his band--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Stage right. In order. Now.

dialog: That means you too, Mini-Me.

text: --and opens it to OVERBROOK COMPETITION CHART.
text: Fletcher appears. Raises his hand.
text: Everyone raises their instruments. Sits still. Waiting...
text: A cough is heard. Fletcher looks to his right. The players
dialog: stay still. No sign of whom it came from...
text: And then -- the slightest move of Fletcher’s index finger. So
dialog: subtle you need absolute focus to even notice it. That’s the
dialog: count-off. Miss it and you’ve blown it for everyone.
dialog: 
text: The BAND LAUNCHES. Quiet at first, then a big brassy sound.
text: Andrew watches Carl’s playing. Taps along on his knees.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Page.
text: (Andrew snaps to it, turns the
dialog: page)
dialog: Damnit...
text: Still conducting, Fletcher approaches, whispers--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Get it together, Tanner, I swear to God.
text: Heads back to his position, glaring at Carl. Pissed at Andrew,

scene_heading: INT. DUNELLEN AUDITORIUM - GREEN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 42
text: The performance over, the PLAYERS trickle BACKSTAGE.
speaker_heading: CARL

scene_heading: INT. DUNELLEN AUDITORIUM - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 43
text: Andrew plugs in for a can of Coke at a vending machine. Sets

dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 43
text: Then -- he overhears TALKING...
speaker_heading: TRUMPETER #1
dialog: That’s what I heard...
text: Andrew turns. Creeps around the corner. Sees a trio of fellow
text: Studio Band PLAYERS, all core, chatting. They don’t see him...
speaker_heading: TRUMPETER #2
dialog: Do you think he’ll make a complaint?
speaker_heading: SAXOPHONIST
dialog: He wants a career. Long as Fletcher
dialog: stays, Fudd could get placed back in. Why
dialog: would he jeopardize that?
text: Andrew leans in to hear more, but before he can get a read--
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I need to look at the music.
text: Carl is inches from his face. Andrew turns to the chair -- but
text: the folder is gone. His eyes go wide. No...
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I have it?
speaker_heading: ANDREW CARL
dialog: Yeah, of course. I’m... Why isn’t it on you?
speaker_heading: ANDREW CARL

speaker_heading: SAXOPHONIST

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (0.S.)
dialog: Drums!! Where the hell is Tanner??
scene_heading: 44 INT. DUNELLEN AUDITORIUM - GREEN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 44
text: Carl, terrified, Andrew behind him, addresses Fletcher--
speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Now is not the time.
speaker_heading: CARL
text: I gave Neiman the folder. Neiman lost it.
dialog: Fletcher looks at Andrew. This is a joke, right?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Neiman lost it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: The folder is YOUR fucking responsibility,

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: A medical condition? What are you,
dialog: Sanjay Gupta?? Play the fucking music!!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I can.
text: Fletcher and Carl both look at him. Neither was expecting him

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: You know “Whiplash” by heart?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes. Every measure. Every note.
text: Quickly realizing this is now his only option--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: You'd better pray your memory doesn’t
dialog: fail you, Neiman. And I hope you've

text: behind him, burning holes with his eyes...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Five-two-two-six-two-two... Six-two-two...
text: Fletcher raises his arm. Hand suspended in air, finger waiting
text: to move... Andrew locks eyes on it. Heart pounding now...
text: And -- the finger moves. The band begins WHIPLASH OVERBROOK. A
text: surging 7/4. Andrew seems caught off-guard at first. Struggles
text: to keep up. Then reaches the right speed -- and stays there.
text: Fletcher keeps his eye on him, waiting for him to fuck up...
text: But Andrew doesn’t. He gets the first hit. Awkward, but in
text: time. Then the second hit -- also graceless, but on target.
text: And here comes the key moment. Fletcher turns his attention
text: to the trumpets -- and away from Andrew.
text: Barely believing his luck, Andrew plays another bar. Still
text: Fletcher doesn’t look at him. He’s focused on other players.
dialog: The number builds some more. And--
speaker_heading: HEAD JUDGE (PRE-LAP)
dialog: First place. Shaffer Conservatory.
scene_heading: INT. DUNELLEN AUDITORIUM - STAGE - HOURS LATER 46
text: Applause. Fletcher summons his PLAYERS to the stage. The JUDGE

speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I’m...supposed to say a few words but...
dialog: it’s these kids who should be speaking...
text: (turning to his band, earnestly)
dialog: You earned this, gang.
dialog: (beat, turns to the audience)
dialog: You know... When I was a kid, I saw God. Or
dialog: as some people know him, Charlie Parker. My
dialog: dad snuck me out of school so we could make
dialog: the drive into Chicago. It was a bar so he
dialog: had to sneak me in, hidden under his coat.
dialog: I didn’t know where in the hell I was. I
dialog: was all of seven. But then, by the time I
dialog: was on my third Shirley Temple, this nice-

dialog: playing. And I’ve never been the same

dialog: I think of them like they were my own kids.
dialog: Treat them that way, too. Treat ‘em like my

dialog: (laughter, and to the band,)
dialog: But it’s true, gang. You’re my family...

speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)

scene_heading: INT. DUNELLEN AUDITORIUM - STAGE - WINGS - CONTINUOUS 46A

speaker_heading: STAGE HAND

speaker_heading: PIANIST

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Do not touch the set.
text: Andrew stops. Just then -- the DOOR OPENS, and Fletcher enters.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: “Cherokee”.

dialog: Tanner, make sure to turn Neiman’s pages.
text: Then he raises his hand. Andrew holds his sticks, still
text: shocked. This is as clear a verdict of his playing at
dialog: Overbrook as he’1ll ever get.
dialog: He’s the new core drummer.
text: Fletcher CLAPS the band off, and before we hear any music we’re--
scene_heading: INT. ROAD TO NEW JERSEY - BUS - DAY 48
text: Andrew watches a VIDEO on his iPhone... It’s 70's footage and
text: audio of a grey-haired DRUMMER, a face we’ve seen before...
text: BUDDY RICH. Andrew smiles. Relaxed. Proud.
text: A bubble pops up: “1 NEW VOICEMAIL, 1 NEW TEXT MESSAGE”.
text: Andrew opens the text. The name on it: “NICOLE”. It reads:
dialog: “You free Thursday?"
text: Andrew is about to answer. Hesitates. Plays the voicemail.
speaker_heading: CARL (0.S.)
dialog: Neiman... You lost that folder on purpose.
dialog: You knew I didn't know the chart by

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Good. I think he likes me more now.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: His opinion means a lot to you, doesn’t it?
text: Jim looks at Andrew. Almost accusatory. A moment...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Grab the shakers please.
scene_heading: INT. JIM’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 50
text: Seven people seated at the table: Jim and Andrew, Andrew's
text: uncle FRANK, aunt EMMA, and 18-year-old cousin DUSTIN. To Jim--
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Jimbo -- overcooked!
dialog: (to Emma, laughing re: the meat)
dialog: I can barely chew this thing.
text: Jim laughs along. Andrew watches. There’s an undercurrent to
text: the joking. The power dynamic between the brothers is clear.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK (CONT’D)
text: He just laughs.
text: Jim keeps laughing.
speaker_heading: AUNT EMMA
dialog: And how's your drumming going, Andy?
text: Andrew, put on the spot, hesitates. But then, excited--
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well... Actually, it’s...it’s going
dialog: really well. I’m now the core drum--
text: The door OPENS. In steps TRAVIS, another cousin, 21, football

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Beat. Then--
speaker_heading: AUNT EMMA (CONT’D)
text: And Andrew. With his drumming.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Yeah, you said that was going ok, Andy?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (a little peeved, )
dialog: It's going spectacularly well, actually.
dialog: I’m...I’m in Shaffer's top jazz
dialog: orchestra, it’s the best in the country --
dialog: and I was just made a core member.
dialog: (there’s no reaction)
dialog: ...Which means I play in competitions.
dialog: I’m one of the youngest they have.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: How do they know who wins in a music
dialog: competition? Isn’t it subjective?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: -.-No, not really.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Does the studio help get you a job?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It’s...it’s not a studio, that’s just the
dialog: name of the ensemble... And yes, it’s a
dialog: big step forward in my career.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: I’m just curious how you make your money
text: as a drummer. After graduating.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 51
text: Andrew glances at his dad. Wondering if maybe he’1l chime in
text: in defense... But no. His dad stays meek and quiet.
speaker_heading: AUNT EMMA
dialog: I saw a TV commercial for credit reports
text: where a young man was playing the drums.
dialog: You could do that.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes, or the Lincoln Center Jazz
dialog: Orchestra. But the credit reports gig is
dialog: a wonderful backup.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: (missing Andrew’s sarcasm)
dialog: Well I’m glad you have it figured out. It’s
dialog: a nasty business, I’m sure.
dialog: (to Travis)
dialog: Oh, you gotta tell them about your game last
dialog: week. I’d say you lived up to your title.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
text: 43-yard touchdown to win it.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: That’s what I’m talking about! On your
dialog: way to the pros.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It’s Division III.
text: Everyone at the table looks at Andrew -- including his dad.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
text: He plays for Carleton. It’s Division III.
dialog: It’s not even Division II.
dialog: (silence, shock around the table)
text: The tilapia is delicious, by the way.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: (I‘1l get you back for that)
dialog: You got a lot of friends, Andy?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: And why’s that?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I don’t see the use.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 52
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Well who will you play with otherwise?
dialog: Who’1l give you your break? Lennon and
dialog: McCartney were school buddies, am I right?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Charlie Parker didn’t know anyone ‘til Jo
text: Jones threw a cymbal at his head.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: And that’s your idea of success, then?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Becoming the greatest musician of the
dialog: twentieth century would be anyone’s idea
dialog: of success.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: Dying broke, drunk, and full of heroin at
dialog: 34 would not be my idea of success.
text: Andrew turns and looks at his dad. Can’t believe he joined in.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (to his dad)
dialog: I'd rather die broke and drunk at 34 and
dialog: have people at a dinner table somewhere
dialog: talk about it than die rich and sober at
dialog: 90 and have no one remember me.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Ah, but friends remember you. That’s the
dialog: whole point.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No, none of us were Charlie Parker’s
dialog: friends. That’s the whole point.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Well there’s such a thing as feeling
dialog: loved and included.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I prefer to feel hated and cast out. It
dialog: gives me purpose.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's ridiculous. You don’t mean that.
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: Travis and Dustin have plenty of friends,
dialog: and I’d say they have plenty of purpose.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 53
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You’re right, they’1l make great School

speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Oh -- so, that’s what this is all about --
dialog: you think you’re better than us?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You catch on quick. You must be in Model UN.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well I’ve got a reply for you, Andrew.
dialog: You think Carleton football’s a joke?

speaker_heading: AUNT EMMA
dialog: Who wants dessert?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: And from Lincoln Center?
text: A moment of silence. Andrew looks at his dad, and his dad
text: just looks right back... A simmering anger in his eyes,
text: Andrew turns to the others, and, slowly--
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: In 1967 a scientist named Laszlo Polgar
dialog: decides to prove talent isn’t about what
dialog: you’re born with but about conditioning.
dialog: Has three kids, Susan, Sophia and Judit,
dialog: and gets them practicing chess for hours
text: and hours before they can even talk.
text: Fifteen years later Susan and Sophia are
dialog: the two top female players in the world,
text: and Judit’s on her way to entering the
dialog: history books as the greatest female
dialog: chess master of all time.
text: Silence once again. Andrew glances at his dad, and delivers
text: back that same accusatory look he saw in the kitchen...
speaker_heading: UNCLE FRANK
dialog: So not only do you want to die at 34,
text: broke, drunk, and addicted to heroin, but
dialog: you also wish you were a lab rat.
dialog: 51
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 54
text: Andrew says nothing. Rises, plate in hand. Walks to the door--
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Enjoy band camp.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Enjoy pretending you’re an ambassador.
text: --and swings it shut behind him.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 51
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Ok, I’m going to just lay it out. This is
dialog: why I don’t think we should be together.
text: We're back in the city, at a coffee shop. Andrew is seated
text: across from Nicole, who just looks at him. Clearly she did
dialog: not think this is how the conversation would begin.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve thought about this a lot. If we’re
dialog: together this is what’s going to happen.
dialog: I’m going to keep pursuing what I’m
dialog: pursuing, and it’s going to take up more
dialog: and more of my time. You’re going to see
dialog: me less and less. When you do, I’‘1l be
dialog: distracted, I’1l be upset, I'll be
dialog: playing things in my mind. And you're
dialog: going to just grow to resent me. At a
dialog: certain point, you’1ll tell me to ease up
dialog: on the drumming, to spend more time with
dialog: you. And I won’t be able to. And I’11
dialog: start to resent you for even asking me
dialog: that. I’1l feel like you’re dragging me
dialog: down, you'll feel like you don’t matter --
dialog: and before long, we’ll hate each other.
dialog: So I think we should just cut it off now,
dialog: cleanly, for those reasons.
text: A beat. Nicole is silent. Finally, Andrew adds--
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Because I want to be great.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: And you’re not.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I want to be one of the greats.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: And I would stop you from doing that.
dialog: 52
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 55
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You know I would stop you from doing
dialog: that. You know that for a fact.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: And I would barely see you anyway.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: And when I did see you, you would treat
dialog: me like shit, because I’m some girl who
dialog: doesn’t know what she wants, and you have
dialog: a path, and you're going to be great, and
dialog: I’m going to be forgotten, and therefore
dialog: you won't be able to give me the time of
dialog: day because you have bigger things to
dialog: pursue.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That's right. That’s exactly my point.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: You’re right. We should not be dating.
text: She gets up.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I’m glad we had this talk.
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Me too.
text: With that, she turns and leaves. We linger on Andrew, the
dialog: look on his face... Did I just fuck up...? No, I'm good.
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - DAY 52
text: A BLAST of music. Horns squealing, cymbals swelling.
text: It’s another Studio Band rehearsal. Andrew’s at the drums,
text: playing well. Fletcher cues a fermata, and the band
scene_heading: finishes STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL AFTER-BREAKUP CHART.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 56
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Alright, gang. Pick up the new chart by
text: the door. Rehearsal tonight starts at 9.
dialog: You have ‘til then to learn it.
text: PLAYERS head out. Andrew grabs his copy of the chart -- it’s
dialog: called “CARAVAN” -- when--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Neiman. Stay a bit, ok?
text: Andrew nods. Carl, at the door, glares at him. Then slinks off.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
text: (approaching, pointing to the chart)
dialog: Look at this. See the tempo?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Quarter note 330...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: That's a double-time swing. That’s what
dialog: got you in here, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I guess so...
text: Fletcher grins. Then -- the smile fades.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Now, just as was the case with you, I
text: stumbled on a kid practicing his double-
dialog: time swing the other night. I’d like to
dialog: give him a shot.
text: Before Andrew can register, let alone ask “Who?”--
speaker_heading: RYAN (0.S.)
dialog: Am I late?
text: Fletcher and Andrew turn to the door. RYAN CONNOLLY is here.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Perfect timing! Join us, Connolly.
text: (Ryan heads over, smiling)
dialog: You two know each other, don’t you?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yep, Nassau Band. ‘Sup, Andrew...
text: Ryan is all smiles. But Andrew is mortified. Can barely
text: conceal his anxiety -- and his anger.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 57
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Now, Connolly, I’ve made Andrew a
dialog: temporary core--
text: (Andrew’s eyes shoot up at
dialog: the word “temporary” )
dialog: --but we've got the competition this
dialog: weekend and I want to make sure the new
text: chart’s in good shape.
text: Ryan nods, reaches into his backpack. And, to Andrew's shock,
text: pulls out the “new chart”. CARAVAN.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: This one, right?
text: Andrew's wide-eyed. When did he get the chart?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: (as though he can read his mind)
dialog: I gave it to him this morning, Neiman.
dialog: Now, all I want to do is test out the
dialog: part. Neiman, if you wouldn’t mind, could
dialog: we take it from the top with just you?
text: Andrew tries to keep calm. Goes to the drums, lays out the
dialog: chart.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t worry, I don’t care about hits.
dialog: That’1l be tonight. For now, just tempo.
text: Andrew nods. Takes a deep breath. Looks at the tempo notation.
text: “330”. Another breath. Ok... I've got this... Fletcher CLAPS.
text: Andrew BEGINS.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: No... That’s not quite my tempo...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I’m -- I’m sorry -- I’1ll--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Let’s see if Connolly can do it, ok?
text: Beat. Andrew looks at Ryan. Heart pounding, he switches with
text: him. Fletcher CLAPS. Ryan BEGINS. And he plays perfectly.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Connolly -- that was excellent. See,
dialog: this is the beauty of Studio Band. You
dialog: come in an alternate -- but a minute
dialog: later, you could be the new core.
text: Andrew's eyes widen again.
dialog: 53
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 58
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You're not serious.
text: Fletcher looks at Andrew -- as though shocked Andrew talked
text: back. A moment of silence. Then -- BZZZZZ. Fletcher's cell.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Connolly, the chart’s yours. See you
dialog: both tonight at 9.
dialog: (answering the phone)
dialog: Hi, this is Terence...
text: He heads to his OFFICE. Andrew is still. What just happened...?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: How you been, bro?
dialog: (Andrew looks at Ryan)
dialog: I think it was the injury that kept me out
dialog: last time. But I’m fuckin’ stoked to be
dialog: joining you guys now.
text: Andrew just stares. Ryan seems earnest -- but Andrew is incensed.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (mistaking Andrew's look for
dialog: anxiety)
dialog: Don’t worry about Fletch, either. My
dialog: granddad knew his dad from the
dialog: Philharmonic when Fletcher was trying to
text: break in. He’s more bark than bite.
text: Andrew's eyes really widen now: What the fuck is going on?
text: He gets up, marches to Fletcher’s door, and--
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - FLETCHER’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 53
text: --BURSTS in. Fletcher’s just finished his call.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER ANDREW
dialog: What are--? I need to talk to you.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER ANDREW
dialog: Now is not the time, I I can play that part, you
dialog: swear to God-- know I can--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I_said NOT NOW!!!
text: There’s more desperation in Fletcher’s voice than anger. And
text: Andrew notices something else: Fletcher’s eyes are watering...
text: Andrew is silent. He’s never seen Fletcher like this.

speaker_heading: 54A

dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 59
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)

dialog: You want the part? Then...earn it.
text: A moment passes.
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - CONTINUOUS 54
text: Andrew busts back through the STUDIO BAND ROOM. Eyes burning.
dialog: One thought and one thought only: Get that part back.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Bro! Wanna grab lunch?
text: But Andrew doesn’t answer. Just keeps walking.
scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY - BASEMENT BATHROOM - DAY 54A
text: Andrew pours ice into a sink. Turns on the faucet. Dips a big
text: glass jug in and collects ice water.
scene_heading: INT. ANDREW’S PRACTICE ROOM - DAY 55
text: Andrew practices the part... He’s pushing, giving it his all...
text: “CARAVAN” on his stand, scribbled over with pencil markings:
dialog: “forte”, “triplets!", “hemiola 1-3", “don't slow down!"
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Come on... Come on...
text: He stops. His hand throbbing from blisters. He dips it by his
text: side -- into the jug of ICE WATER. Clenches. Blood clouds the
dialog: water.
text: He resumes playing -- frenzied, exhausted. Fucks up, screams out--
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck!!!!
text: Starts pounding his stick against the drum-head. Then his hand.
dialog: Pounding harder and harder, once, twice, three times, four
text: times. Hand bleeding more, the drum-skin giving way, finally
text: tearing and breaking.
text: He STARTS PLAYING again, fed up, enraged, SHOUTING at himself--
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT’D)

scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 56
text: A crowded subway car. Andrew is seated, poring over his sheet
text: music, running through the beats in his head...
scene_heading: INT. GEHRING HALL - STUDIO BAND ROOM - NIGHT 57
text: The PLAYERS sit silently. Ryan on the drum throne, Carl and
text: Andrew behind him -- Carl still humiliated, Andrew 100%
text: focused. The clock reads: 9:00. Not a word in the room.
text: Fletcher emerges. A CD PLAYER in his hand. He plugs it in.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Ok... Um...
text: For the first time ever, he seems uneasy, unsure what to say.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: We...we have a new player. Ryan Connolly.
text: Ryan nods, waves to the other PLAYERS. Chipper--
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sup, dudes.
text: Andrew glares at him. Seething now. But, continuing, softly--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: But I...if you could just...put your
text: instruments down... Just for a second...
text: He turns to the CD player. Turns it on. A big-band ballad
text: swells. A muted trumpet takes the lead. It’s CASEY’S SONG,
text: and it’s a tender sound, full of melancholy...
text: For a few seconds, Fletcher doesn’t say a word. His thoughts
text: seem to be drifting. Then, hesitant, as the music plays...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Six years ago...I saw a kid practicing
text: scales in a band room here. He'd started at
dialog: Shaffer with a lot of hope, but the truth
text: was he’d barely squeaked in and he was
text: struggling. Everyone on the faculty told
dialog: him: “This isn’t for you.” But they didn’t
dialog: see what I saw...
text: (his voice croaking again,
dialog: emotional, )
dialog: ...this...this scared, skinny kid cursing
dialog: himself ‘cause he couldn’t get his scales
dialog: right... I saw a drive in him...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 61
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: And I put him in Studio Band, and we
dialog: worked together for three years, and when
dialog: he graduated, Marsalis made him third
text: trumpet at Lincoln Center. A year later,
dialog: he was first. That’s who you’re hearing
dialog: now.
dialog: (then, )
dialog: His name was Sean Casey.
text: The name catches Andrew’s attention. The trumpeter Fletcher
dialog: mentioned to him... And the word “was”...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: I found out this morning...that Sean died.
dialog: He died in a car accident yesterday...
text: (takes a moment, is having
dialog: trouble speaking)
dialog: I just wanted you guys to know that...
dialog: He was... Sean was a...
text: (and, almost dissolving into
dialog: tears on these next words)
dialog: -.-beautiful player...
dialog: (breathes in, collects himself)
dialog: I just thought you all should know.
text: Beat. He leans back down and turns off the CD. Silence.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: (another moment; then, still shaky--)
dialog: “Caravan”. From bar 142, please.
text: The PLAYERS open their folders, pick up their instruments.
text: Fletcher waits. Hesitates again... Then -- CLAPS. Just drums,
text: bass and trombone play the trombone solo section of CARAVAN
text: STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL. Fast, precise -- but Fletcher waves to
dialog: Ryan to stop.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: No, that’s...that’s not quite right,
dialog: Connolly... Sorry...
text: Andrew's eyes instantly fill with hope. Is this his chance?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I... I want to try Neiman on this... Ok?
text: Ryan nods, slowly slides off -- as Andrew quickly gets on.
text: Clutches his sticks tight. This is it... Fletcher’s still shaky--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Maybe...maybe now’s the time for Neiman
dialog: to earn the part...
text: Beat. He CLAPS off, Andrew starts, and, only ONE SECOND later--
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 62
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: No, I guess not. Tanner.
text: An anger is creeping into Fletcher's voice now. The
text: stammering fading away, bit by bit. Dismayed, Andrew gets
text: off, Carl gets on, Fletcher CLAPS him off -- and then,
text: SLAMMING his fist down on his table, the barely suppressed
text: grief giving way now to terrifying, full-out rage--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mother-FUCKER! ! !
text: Carl JUMPS. The band goes silent. Fletcher glares at his
dialog: drummers, eyes so heated they could burn holes into you.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Get your ass back on the kit, Connolly.
text: Ryan does. The other players are still. Real fear in the room...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: I will find my tempo out of one of you
dialog: faggots if it takes me all goddamned night.
text: His tone is vicious, his eyes still watery. He CLAPS, stops-—-
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Which it just might. Neiman.
text: Andrew gets on. His hands are shaking. Fletcher CLAPS, stops--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Not my tempo. Switch.
text: Carl gets back on. Fletcher CLAPS, stops yet again--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Not my FUCKING tempo! !!!
text: He turns to the rest of the band. Rubs his eyes, breathes, and
text: then, trying to keep calm but his face already beet-red...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Ok... Sorry about this, gang, hate to put
dialog: you through it. But rest your arms, put
dialog: aside your instruments, if you need to
dialog: take a dump do it now, ‘cause I am going
dialog: to go for as long as it takes until I
text: find a drummer who can play in time.
dialog: (to the drummers--)

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: When I earned that part.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Earned? You've never earned a thing. The

text: His left hand still hidden, Andrew props up his music and
text: pulls out a pair of sticks. Tries to hold his left stick
text: properly -- but it keeps giving way. With his index finger
text: broken, it’s impossible to keep the stick steady...
text: He looks at the music: “Caravan”... Looks back at his hand...
text: Tries to move his left fingers, mimicking the stick patterns...
text: Just up ahead -- Fletcher. Animal intensity...
text: Andrew closes his eyes... Tries to block out the anxiety...

text: Panicked, Andrew turns, eyes his old Nassau Band peer -- Ryan.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Ryan... Stick...

text: right then and there he makes his choice.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Please...
text: Neither Carl nor Ryan moves.
text: Andrew, thinking fast, eyes the fallen stick. Trying as hard as

text: down the left side of his body, stretching his arm as far as it
text: can go... His broken finger grazing the stick... Grabbing hold...
text: Pulls up -- and -- another CRAAAAAACK as his finger is caught
text: against the hi-hat pedal and the bone is bent 90 degrees. He
text: GASPS, almost cries out in pain. Has to hold it in.
text: Pulls himself back up to the set -- and there, looming over him
text: already, is Fletcher. Eyes fiery--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: The fuck are you doing...???
text: Andrew keeps playing. But the PAIN is harder and harder to
text: ignore. His snare drum completely smeared in red now, his

text: growing and growing, drowning out everything else...
text: He looks at the SHEET MUSIC, suddenly lost... The horns blast
text: out a hit -- but Andrew isn’t on it. Fuck. Launches into another
text: fill -- and hits the crash at the wrong time.
text: Fletcher stares at him. The look says it all: it’s over. But
text: Andrew keeps fighting. Another missed hit, then a missed time-
text: signature change, the beat falling apart beneath his feet. Total

text: Calmly, Fletcher approaches Andrew and whispers one last thing:
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: You're done.
text: Then he turns around. Andrew start shaking, his eyes brimming

text: Cymbals CRASH to the wooden stage-floor like bombs. Andrew
text: CHARGES forward -- and, just as Fletcher turns to him, TACKLES
dialog: the man to the ground...
text: Andrew goes absolutely batshit crazy on Fletcher, murder in his

text: Torn from his target, Andrew breaks down into TEARS. Every-
text: thing inside him spilling out like water. Fletcher, stunned but
text: uninjured, gets back on his feet. His shirt drips with blood --

speaker_heading: RACHEL BORNHOLDT (CONT’D)
dialog: Now, the Caseys aren’t wealthy. They
dialog: don’t want to file suit.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Then what do they want?
scene_heading: RACHEL BORNHOLDT
dialog: To make sure Terence Fletcher is never
dialog: allowed to do this to another student.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: He didn’t do anything.
scene_heading: RACHEL BORNHOLDT
dialog: So President Kohn and Dean Pence will tell
dialog: you. To them, Fletcher is Shaffer.

speaker_heading: RACHEL BORNHOLDT (CONT'D)

dialog: choice but to let him go before we do.
text: Beat. Andrew looks at her. Then at his dad.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well, I have nothing to say.
text: Jim leans forward now, taking the initiative--
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Andrew... It’s over, ok...? He’s out of
dialog: your life. Why let him get away with what
dialog: he did to you?
dialog: He eyes Rachel. Ok...? Was that the right thing to say...?
text: Andrew stays silent.
scene_heading: RACHEL BORNHOLDT
dialog: Would you characterize his conduct as
dialog: extreme, Andrew? Did he ever intentionally
dialog: inflict emotional distress?
text: Still Andrew doesn’t respond. Feels his dad’s stare on
dialog: him as well now.
speaker_heading: RACHEL BORNHOLDT (CONT’D)
dialog: (trying to persuade--)
dialog: This would not be a public hearing, you
dialog: know... Fletcher would never know it was
dialog: you who spoke up.
text: Andrew looks at the glass of water in front of him. Untouched.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: ...-What would happen to him?
scene_heading: RACHEL BORNHOLDT
dialog: Shaffer will do anything to prevent this
dialog: from going to court. Yours won’t be the
dialog: first complaint, but I think it’1l tip
dialog: the balance. You’re recent.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You tried other students?
scene_heading: RACHEL BORNHOLDT
dialog: Some -- but you guys are walls.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: And you thought I'd talk.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 79
scene_heading: RACHEL BORNHOLDT
dialog: You have nothing to gain from Fletcher
dialog: anymore.
text: A beat. Andrew turns his eyes to his dad. Anger in his gaze--
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Why did you do this...?
text: Jim seems taken aback. Flustered for a second. Then--
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You think I was going to let him put my
dialog: son through hell and walk off scot-free?
text: Andrew turns away. Jim can see the hurt on his son’s face.
text: The sense of betrayal. Worried, trying to reach out--
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t you know I would never let that
dialog: happen, Andrew? That there’s nothing in
dialog: the world more important to me than you?
text: (beat; Andrew evades his gaze)
dialog: Don’t you know that?
text: A moment. Andrew looks at his dad again.
text: Then he stares ahead. WE PUSH in on him, slowly -- as he
text: drifts deeper into thought, trying to sort through it
dialog: all...
speaker_heading: RACHEL BORNHOLDT (0.S.)
dialog: ...Andrew?
text: Andrew can barely hear her...
text: Defeated, his soul split in two... Finally -- he gives up.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT 92

text: There, on the club’s main sign, below the featured names, are
text: these words: “Guest Performer: TERENCE FLETCHER”. Andrew stays
text: put for a second. Completely taken aback. Then he starts
text: walking away. Then stops. Nope. Turns around...
scene_heading: INT. JAZZ CLUB - MOMENTS LATER 93
text: -.-and steps inside. It’s a genteel venue. On the stage, BASS,
text: DRUMS, BONGOS -- and, at the piano, FLETCHER.
text: The mere sight gets Andrew’s pulse racing. But he stays put.
text: Watches... The quartet is pacing its way through FLETCHER’S
text: SONG IN CLUB, and Fletcher is playing the final head. He's
text: exceedingly delicate, gentle with each keystroke, his fingers
text: moving like ballerinas. His playing is soft, subtle, and
text: exquisite. He plays the melody as though moved by it.
text: Andrew is surprised by this... Stays in the back, behind the
text: last table. The song comes to a close. Fletcher smiles, looks --
text: and then freezes. His eyes locked on Andrew. He has seen him.
text: Andrew blanches, takes a step back, hurries for the exit. But
text: there's a PERSON blocking the way. Tries to squeeze through--
speaker_heading: DRUMMER (0.S.)
dialog: That was Terence Fletcher, on the keys...
text: More applause. Andrew, hemmed in, keeps trying to get out--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Neiman.

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: +. -Hi...
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT 93A
text: A table in the corner. Fletcher and Andrew seated. They seem to

text: stand between them. Untouched. The other band members on-stage
text: play JAZZ CLUB BLUES, a new PIANIST on the keys and a
text: SAXOPHONIST added as well. Finally--
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 85
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: So what are you up to these days, Andrew?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: --.Oh, just...you know...various...things...
text: Fletcher nods. Ok. Andrew eyes him. Then, nervous--
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: .-..I--I’m sorry about what happened.
dialog: (then, should I clarify?--)
dialog: At Dunellen.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: You shouldn’t be. A player’s got to be
dialog: willing to fight.
text: Andrew looks at him.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: You played with a broken bone. After
dialog: crashing a car. That’s insane.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I was in a different place.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Good thing you’re not in that place
dialog: anymore.
text: A beat. Then -- Fletcher seems distracted. By people CLAPPING
dialog: ALONG to the band...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Have you ever noticed it’s never the
dialog: people with rhythm who clap along?
text: He starts CLAPPING loudly, in the proper tempo. Leans over to
text: the table next to his, where a COUPLE is clapping off-beat, and
text: starts CLAPPING in their faces. Then sits back down.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know if you know... I don’t teach
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I... I heard about that... You quit?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: -..No, not exactly.
text: He looks at Andrew. A moment of tension. Does he know...?
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 86
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: A couple parents got a kid from Sean
dialog: Casey's year... I don’t know who, I think
dialog: maybe a bassist... They got him to say a
dialog: few things about me... That much I know...
dialog: (Andrew tries to hide his relief)
dialog: Though why anyone would have anything but
dialog: honey and sugar to say about me is a
dialog: mystery.
text: Andrew laughs. Seems the mood has lightened.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: That’s a good laugh, huh?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Oh, no... I...I just--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: No, it’s ok -- I know I’ve made some
dialog: enemies. Maybe I seem to think my style
dialog: is normal, but believe me, I don’t.
text: A moment. Fletcher finally takes a sip of his drink.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m conducting some, though. They’re
dialog: bringing back the JVC Fest this year, got
dialog: me opening with a pro band in two weeks.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (genuinely impressed)
dialog: That’s amazing.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: (earns)
dialog: It’s ok...
text: Then, looking off for a moment--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: The truth is I don’t think people
dialog: understand what it is I did at Shaffer. I
dialog: wasn’t there to conduct. Any idiot can
dialog: move his hands and keep people in tempo.
dialog: No, it’s about pushing people beyond
dialog: what's expected of them. And I believe
dialog: that is a necessity. Because without it
dialog: you’re depriving the world of its next
dialog: Armstrong. Its next Parker.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Why did Charlie Parker become Charlie
dialog: Parker, Andrew?
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 87
text: Beat. Andrew is surprised. He’s told this story himself.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
text: Because Jo Jones threw a cymbal at him.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Exactly. Young kid, pretty good on the
text: sax, goes up to play his solo ina
text: cutting session, fucks up -- and Jones
text: comes this close to slicing his head off
text: for it. He’s laughed off-stage. Cries
text: himself to sleep that night. But the next
dialog: morning, what does he do? He practices.
dialog: And practices and practices. With one
dialog: goal in mind: that he never ever be
dialog: laughed off-stage again. A year later he
text: goes back to the Reno, and he plays the
dialog: best motherfucking solo the world had
dialog: ever heard.
dialog: 
text: Andrew smiles. Nods. Finally -- unlike his uncles, his cousins,
dialog: even his father -- someone who gets it.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Now imagine if Jones had just patted
dialog: young Charlie on the head and said “Good
dialog: job.” Charlie would've said to himself,
dialog: “Well, shit, I did do a good job,” and
dialog: that'd be that. No Bird. Tragedy, right?
dialog: Except that’s just what people today
dialog: want. The Shaffer Conservatories of the
dialog: world, they want sugar. You don’t even
dialog: say “cutting session” anymore, do you?
dialog: No, you say “jam session”. What the fuck
dialog: kind of word is that? Jam session? It’s a
dialog: cutting session, Andrew, this isn’t
dialog: fucking Smucker’s. It’s about weeding out
dialog: the best from the worst so that the worst
dialog: become better than the best.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I mean look around you. $25 drinks, mood
text: lighting, a little shrimp cocktail to go
dialog: with your Coltrane. And people wonder why
text: jazz is dying.
dialog: (then, )
dialog: Take it from me, and every Starbucks jazz
dialog: album only proves my point. There are no
dialog: two words more harmful in the entire
dialog: English language than “good job”.
text: Beat. He leans back. Lets his words linger. Andrew thinks...
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 88
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: But do you think there’s a line? You know
dialog: -- where you discourage the next Charlie
dialog: Parker from becoming Charlie Parker?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: No. Because the next Charlie Parker would
dialog: never be discouraged.
text: Andrew takes this in. A moment...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: ..-And you? Are you back to playing now?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Not really. Here and there... The playing
dialog: never interested me. I never wanted to be
dialog: Charlie Parker. I wanted to be the man
dialog: who made Charlie Parker. The man who
dialog: discovered some scrawny kid, pushed him,
dialog: prodded him, shaped him into something
dialog: great -- and then said to the world,
dialog: “Check this out. The best motherfucking
dialog: solo you've ever heard.”
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Who’s your Charlie Parker, then?
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: Sean Casey...?
text: The name hits Fletcher. Fletcher looks at Andrew -- who
text: immediately regrets bringing that name up. Why? Because, even
text: after everything, the sight of Fletcher hurting affects him...
text: He pauses.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Sean... Sean was a sweet kid... And with
dialog: all those idiots saying “This isn’t for
dialog: you”, Sean did something great. Very few
dialog: people ever get that chance...
text: Looks off. Looks at the musicians on-stage...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: But no... Not Sean Casey.
dialog: (then, as he thinks about this, )
dialog: The truth is I don’t know if I ever had a
dialog: Charlie Parker...
dialog: (and then, )
dialog: But I tried. And that’s more than most
dialog: people can say, Andrew. I tried. And even
dialog: if I never find one, I will never
dialog: apologize for trying.
dialog: 94
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 89
text: He’s silent. A look of disappointment.
text: Then, he points to the PIANIST on-stage...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: He’s a beautiful player, isn’t he?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah...
text: Fletcher nods. His thoughts drifting again. A moment passes.
scene_heading: EXT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT 94
text: Andrew and Fletcher exit. They stand for a second. Look at
text: one another. An awkward silence.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Nice seeing you...
text: Fletcher nods. Beat. Andrew turns, about to head off, when--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Look. I don’t know how you’1l take this.
dialog: That band I’m leading for JVC -- our
dialog: drummer isn’t cutting it.
text: (Andrew looks at him blankly...)
dialog: Do you understand...?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I’m using the Studio Band playlist.
dialog: “Whiplash”, “Caravan”. I need a
dialog: replacement who already knows those
text: charts inside out.
dialog: Andrew looks at him. You can’t be serious...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (trying to gather his thoughts)
dialog: Wh-- what -- what about Ryan Connolly...?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: What about him? All he was was your
dialog: incentive.

text: Andrew is speechless now. Is this really happening?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: We're rehearsing next Tuesday. Why don’t
dialog: you take the weekend to think about it?
text: Andrew takes it all in. WE PUSH in on him, processing... And,
text: slowly but surely, his shock and uncertainty harden before our
dialog: eyes -- into resolution... This is something to seize on.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I don’t need to.
scene_heading: INT. ANDREW'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY 95
text: BLACK -- then light floods in. Andrew has just opened his

scene_heading: INT. ANDREW’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING 95B

scene_heading: INT. JUDY AND ARTHUR ZANKEL HALL - NIGHT 96

dialog: Rest up, gang. Call-time Sunday is 6.
dialog: (and, as he heads off, )
dialog: Andrew.
dialog: (Andrew turns)
dialog: Good job.
text: Andrew takes this in. The latest in a long line of

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hope that was ok.
speaker_heading: BASSIST
dialog: Yeah. You sounded good.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Thanks. You too.
dialog: (then, )
dialog: Is there...anything you worked out with
dialog: the previous guy that I should know?
speaker_heading: BASSIST
dialog: Previous guy?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: The previous drummer.
text: The BASSIST looks at him: What?
speaker_heading: BASSIST
dialog: Last week we rehearsed without drums.
dialog: You’re the only drummer we've ever had.

text: Andrew enters. Eyes his drums. Then -- he has a thought.
speaker_heading: Pink (9/10/2013) 91A
text: He pulls out his phone. Hesitates. Nervous -- but excited now.
text: He dials. We hear ringing, he feels his heart thumping, he nods
text: to himself, starts walking forward, breathes in, and then,
dialog: after a few seconds --
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 92
speaker_heading: NICOLE (0.S.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (pacing, stomach clenching, it’s

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I -- I just figured I'd call -- it’s been

text: (a beat; she doesn’t respond;
text: he sits down, trying to get
dialog: the words out--)
dialog: And I -- I didn’t know if you knew -- I’m
dialog: playing JVC this weekend... Maybe you’d
dialog: like to come? We could grab pizza afterward
dialog: and complain about our schools again...
text: He chuckles. Then waits. Beat.
speaker_heading: NICOLE (0.S.)
dialog: Jv?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Uh -- no, Jvc. It’s a jazz festival.

speaker_heading: ANDREW
text: It’s next Friday.
speaker_heading: NICOLE (0.S.)
dialog: Ok... I don't know, I'll check with my

dialog: ---Got it.
dialog: (silence; then--)
dialog: Well... Cool. Maybe I’1l see you there.
speaker_heading: NICOLE (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah, I'1l check. I don't think he likes

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Cool... Thanks.
text: Nicole hangs up. You can see it in Andrew’s eyes -- real

dialog: core. Or a Blue Note signee. Or an EMC
dialog: client. Drop the ball, and I'd suggest
dialog: switching careers -- because the other
dialog: thing about those cats is they never
dialog: forget.
text: Andrew takes this in. Beat. A STAGE HAND appears, waves. Time.
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: On that note -- break a leg.
text: The PLAYERS proceed on-stage. Andrew takes a deep breath,
text: tries to keep his cool, and, counting in his head, walks
dialog: forward --
dialog: 106
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 96
scene_heading: INT. ZANKEL HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS 106
text: The stage is decked in blue lights. The instruments gleam.
text: Beyond it, a yawning expanse of black. The audience... And a
text: hush, an undercurrent of murmurs and whispers gathering
text: steam, as each PLAYER takes to the stage, one by one...
text: Then -- APPLAUSE. 1200 people’s worth of applause. Fletcher
text: appears, taking his spot, smiling. The applause swells up.
text: And then -- Fletcher turns around to face Andrew. He stares
text: at_him for what seems like a full minute. Comes up to him,
text: making as though helping him position a microphone over the
text: drum kit, and, leaning in, quietly, discreetly, menacingly--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: It was you.
text: The lights shift. Blue to bright, harsh, near-blinding yellow.
text: It's showtime. Andrew is completely still.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: ...Was...was me what...?
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: (then, leaning in even closer,)
dialog: Why do you think I invited you here? I’ve
dialog: known it was you all along.
text: Beat. He lets it sink in. Retreats to his spot, smiling at
text: Andrew. Then, off Andrew’s paralyzed stare, he turns to the
text: audience. They APPLAUD. A few seconds later...silence. Then--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We’re
dialog: going to start things off with an old
dialog: favorite of mine.
text: Andrew, his heart in his throat, looks at his sheet music.
text: “WHIPLASH”. Holds his sticks tight, but his hands are now
text: slippery with sweat... Fletcher waits. More silence...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s called “Upswingin’”.
dialog: ON ANDREW. What?
text: Andrew turns to his left and catches a glimpse of the
text: SAXOPHONISTS’ sheet music. Written on the top: “UPSWINGIN’”. He
text: turns right, sees the BASSIST’s music. Ditto. He looks ahead.
text: And there's Fletcher -- staring right back at him. And smiling.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 97
dialog: Andrew turns around. Has to stop this. Can’t ruin it for the
text: other PLAYERS -- but Fletcher has already raised his hand for
text: the cue. Andrew rises from his seat -- when the BASSIST
text: glares at him: What are you doing? And just then -- within
dialog: that same split-second --
text: -- Fletcher’s index finger bends down.
dialog: The cue.
text: The BAND EXPLODES into UPSWINGIN’. Horns blasting, saxes
text: wailing -- fast, furious, half-Latin and half-swing. Andrew
text: doesn’t even play at first -- doesn’t want to destroy this. But
text: glares quickly follow, and he has no choice...
text: He plays. Trains his ears to try to stay on target... But the
dialog: time signature is impossible to get a firm grip on... He
text: misses a fill... Then the time signature changes... He can’t
text: keep up... Then the band gives way to rubato piano... He stops
text: late... Then the band surges back in... He comes in late...
text: He’s driving completely blind.
speaker_heading: BASSIST
dialog: (clenched teeth to Andrew)
dialog: The fuck?! Come on...
text: Andrew, desperate, tries to fix things -- but he can’t.
text: Sliding further and further behind. PLAYERS eying him. You
text: can almost hear MURMURS in the audience, rising in volume...
text: And, through it all, Fletcher seems serene.
text: Andrew misses yet another break, and--
speaker_heading: BASSIST (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?
text: This hits Andrew like a knife. Tears well up in his eyes. This
dialog: performance is already so far beyond saving...
text: Another missed hit. More MURMURS in the audience, louder and
text: louder now, as the number veers, swerves, and sloppily
text: staggers to its close... A swell of horns, a misplaced crash
text: of cymbals, what seems like a fermata... Andrew stops -- just
text: as the band RESUMES. And just as Andrew resumes -- the band
speaker_heading: STOPS.
text: Andrew's playing alone. He quickly moves to silence his
text: drums. The chart is done.
text: And now -- the deafening silence.
text: No applause. Just the sound softly rippling and settling from
text: Andrew's last cymbal hit...
dialog: 107
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 98
text: Andrew sits at his set, in tears. Fletcher stays still. Looks
text: at Andrew. On Fletcher's face, the look of a victor... As he
text: turns back to the audience we hear...
text: +..a smattering of polite, muted applause trickling
text: throughout the theater. Quiet, half-hearted, pitiful.
dialog: No one here has ever seen a disaster quite like that before.
scene_heading: IN THE AUDIENCE
text: We see Jim, standing in the very back, by the doors...
text: Mortified, heading for the hall...
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Fletcher sashays back to the drum set. To Andrew, with a grin--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I guess you don’t have it.
text: Andrew is still in his seat. Tears stinging his cheeks...
speaker_heading: BASSIST
dialog: Didn't you get the fucking chart?
text: Andrew looks at the Bassist. Realizes what Fletcher did... Sees
text: the other MUSICIANS glaring at him, infuriated...
scene_heading: IN THE AUDIENCE
text: Andrew feels the AUDIENCE staring at him -- can almost make out
text: their faces as the stage lights begin to DIM...
text: Seated in one of the front rows -- is NICOLE. We see that next
text: to her, holding her hand, is a YOUNG MAN...
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Feeling CRUSHED, HUMILIATED, NAUSEATED, Andrew staggers up...
text: ...-and RETREATS to the back of the stage. Out of the audience's
dialog: view -- about to leave this all behind once and for all...
scene_heading: INT. ZANKEL HALL - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 107
text: Jim running... Down the hall... Toward the entrance to
dialog: backstage...
dialog: 108
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 99
scene_heading: INT. ZANKEL HALL - STAGE - CONTINUOUS 108
text: Back to Andrew... Retreating BACKSTAGE...
text: .-.-when he sees -- around the corner of the backstage entrance --
dialog: -- his father.
speaker_heading: IN THE WINGS
text: Jim has just arrived at the entryway. Looks at Andrew. Hurries
text: toward him. Is going to put an end to this. Andrew looks at
text: his dad for a moment, approaching. Jim reaches him --
dialog: -- and HUGS him.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I love you. I’m so sorry this is
dialog: happening to you.
text: Andrew looks at his dad. Something seems to click inside him at
dialog: that instant.
text: He pulls back. The desperation in his eyes giving way to
text: something else. Jim watches Andrew as Andrew steps backward,
dialog: before...
text: +..a pair of STAGE HANDS arrive.
speaker_heading: STAGE HAND
dialog: Sir, you can’t be here--
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yes I can, I’m taking him with me--
speaker_heading: STAGE HAND
dialog: (to Andrew)
dialog: You know each other?
text: Andrew is silent for a moment. Still. As though it has just
text: dawned on him.
text: He takes in the sight -- his dad, dwarfed by the Stage Hands,
text: reaching out to him. Jim has never looked quite so small to his
dialog: son, quite so pathetic, as at this moment.
text: A beat. More silence. And then --
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No.
text: Jim goes wide-eyed. Utterly shocked. Andrew steps further
text: back, as the STAGE HANDS move to pull Jim away--
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 100
speaker_heading: STAGE HAND
dialog: Alright, sir, that’s enough--
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: My -- my son -- I need to get my son--
speaker_heading: STAGE HAND
dialog: Let’s calm down--
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (frantic now--)
dialog: Andrew! !
text: Andrew calmly turns his back to his father and coldly heads to
dialog: the stage.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Andrew! !
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Andrew grabs new sticks, makes as though he was just switching
text: pairs and never leaving, and, ignoring his father’s calls from
text: behind -- trains his eyes back on Fletcher.
text: Fletcher looks at Andrew. Seems pleased: This will be fun...
text: But Andrew doesn’t look scared anymore. Instead, his eyes are
text: glassy, hollowed out -- and hungry... There’s a rage in them
dialog: that we haven’t seen before... This will not be the end...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: (to the audience)
dialog: Thank you... For our final number we’re
dialog: bringing it back to Ellington. This is
dialog: “Caravan”.
text: But then, before Fletcher can even turn back around -- let alone
text: cue the band -- Andrew launches into a double-time Latin.
dialog: 
text: Alone, his stick beating away at the ride cymbal, setting the
text: tempo for the rest of the band. Everyone looks at him. What
text: the fuck...? He has started on his own, before any cue,
text: beating the drums as though vengefully.
text: Fletcher glares at him. Who the fuck do you think you are? But
text: Andrew just keeps playing. Knows exactly what he’s doing and is
text: not about to be stopped. Building in his eyes -- that same
text: coiled rage... To the BASSIST--
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Follow me on four.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 101
text: The BASSIST has no choice. Andrew nods in time as a count-off,
text: and the BASSIST joins in. Now we’ve got the bass and drums
text: playing, laying out the beat. Andrew looks back at Fletcher.
text: Drills into him with his eyes -- the kind of look Fletcher has so
text: often given him. And, subtly, so that only Fletcher can see it,
text: Andrew mouths out two words:
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck. You.
text: It hits Fletcher. Realizing he too has no choice, Fletcher eyes
text: the rest of the band. Raises his hands, re-assuming control --
text: or trying to make as though he has control -- and cues them in.
text: The BAND begins CARAVAN PLUS DRUM SOLO CARNEGIE HALL, plays the
text: opening patterns, Andrew matching them beat for beat.
text: Fletcher then edges toward Andrew. His back turned to the
text: audience, only Andrew can see his face, he leans in and--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: I will gouge out your eyes you motherfucker.
text: --but Andrew promptly DROWNS HIM OUT with a crash cymbal hit.
text: Another “fuck you”. Fletcher’s words only seem to strengthen him.
text: The band roars into overdrive, the brass blasting away, Andrew
text: giving everything he’s got. Fletcher steps back. Andrew just
text: keeps looking straight ahead at him. Unafraid now. A machine.
text: SOLOS begin... TROMBONE is up first... WE MOVE IN CLOSE to
text: Andrew... He looks at his right arm... It’s still going... He
text: himself seems surprised. He takes a chance -- plays a tricky
text: fill. Nails it. Goes again -- the off-beat hi-hat accent that
text: tripped him up in his first Studio Band rehearsal. Nails it.
text: The audience is silent... No murmurs this time... Back to
text: Andrew... WE DRIFT DOWN TO HIS FEET... His right foot feathering
text: the bass drum so fast all we can see is a blur...
text: WE DRIFT BACK UP... His left hand... Notes popping on the
text: snare, the toms... Both his arms battered but utterly
text: determined, as though with minds of their own... He breathes,
text: breathes, beating against his fears, his doubts...
text: He’s in control, pouring himself into his drums -- and it’s a
text: sight to behold. Like a master dancer, movements so fast yet
text: precise, brash yet elegant... Violent, frenetic playing, but
dialog: there’s something gorgeous about it...
text: WE DRIFT TO FLETCHER... Still glaring at Andrew -- but his
dialog: face now says one thing and one thing only: This is playing
dialog: he has never seen before.
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 102
text: The brass starts giving way to drum breaks... And Andrew
text: makes of each break a stunner... His double-stroke rolls rip-
text: roaring across the toms, his feet and legs switching rhythms,
text: meters, tempos, then careening back into place... All limbs
text: moving in a sustained frenzy, sweat splashing, mouth open,
text: eyes blazing, the whole set vibrating, then shaking, looks
text: like it’s about to explode...
text: Fletcher turns an inch toward the AUDIENCE... Sees them
dialog: transfixed...
text: AT THE LOBBY DOORS
text: ...dim watches through the opened lobby doors...
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: The number is at a peak... And Fletcher, like so many, is now
text: just watching Andrew... The band nears the coda... The
text: melody, the rat-a-tat-tat patterns, the squealing horns and
text: growling saxes... The drums pushing it all forward...
text: Fletcher almost smiles. Was this his plan all along...?
text: He moves his arms, conducting again... The band reaches the
text: final bar... The final note... He raises his hands... Sustains
text: the note. Swings his arm down... A BLAST of horns. And the
dialog: 
text: band is finished.
text: Except, that is, for the drums. Andrew’s still playing,
text: launching into an extended solo...
text: Fletcher looks at him. Confused now. Goes up to the drums-—-
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Andrew -- Andrew--
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (over his playing)
dialog: I’‘1l cue the band... Wait for my cue...
text: There’s nothing more Fletcher can do. Andrew's playing grows
text: louder, more involved, all four limbs joining in, the sound
text: growing bigger and bigger... He has effectively taken over
text: the stage -- and all the other PLAYERS can do is watch... He
dialog: is the bandleader.
text: Andrew looks ahead... Past Fletcher... To the darkness... To
text: the audience... He leans forward, closes his eyes, dives in...
text: Sticks whirling, arms and legs belting and hammering, his
text: head bobbing up and down, his back arched... Keeps the
text: rudiments going on his left hand... Adds one ingredient, then
dialog: another... Then a third, then a fourth...
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 103
text: Keeps adding and building and piling on, beyond anything he’s
dialog: ever attempted... Going absolutely batshit-insane on the kit,
text: sweat flying, hands blurring, drums trembling...
text: AT THE LOBBY DOORS
text: Jim watches Andrew -- crazed, exhausted, looks like he’s
text: pushing himself past what is safe -- and knows there is
text: no longer anything he can do about it.
dialog: He has lost.
text: And then -- one of the USHERS steps forward from the edge
text: of the stage. He looks at Jim -- and closes the doors,
text: blocking Jim’s view.
text: We linger on Jim for a moment -- behind the closed door, in
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Back to Andrew -- at the height of intensity... Keeps his
text: eyes closed... Feeling his way through this... Shooting back
text: into the double-time... But trying to go even faster than
dialog: before... Not 330... Not even 400... Trying, trying, trying
dialog: to reach that mythical place, the place where only the greats
dialog: live... 410... 420... Even 430...
text: Fletcher stands still... His eyes widening... He’s no longer
text: calculating... Not even thinking... He’s just awed.
text: Murmurs throughout the AUDIENCE... Audible, even over the
text: roar of the drum set... They can’t believe it...
dialog: 435 now... 440... 443...
dialog: Which means those sticks are moving faster than a tennis ball
text: shot across a court... Faster than Andrew has ever moved...
dialog: Faster...faster...and, finally...
dialog: ---450.
text: Andrew OPENS HIS EYES... He’s in disbelief. The stage is his.
text: He owns it. He breaks back into snare-based patterns, rolling
text: around the toms, the cymbals...
text: Fletcher is floored. Turns, sees something extraordinary out
text: there, just visible in the darkness of the theater...
scene_heading: IN THE AUDIENCE
text: AUDIENCE MEMBERS turning to each other... A line-up of suit-
text: and-tie spectators whipping out phones or pads...
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 104
scene_heading: MANAGERS, JOURNALISTS, A&R EXECS, BANDLEADERS... A few
text: hurrying out, as though in a mad rush, making frantic calls...
text: More people peering INTO THE THEATER through glass doors...
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: We TURN BACK to Andrew -- his ears start RINGING... The NOISE
text: grows with each hit, drowning out all the other noises...
text: Andrew clenches his jaw, closes his eyes again, keeps
text: playing, tries to ignore it... Plays harder, louder, pounding
dialog: away...
text: Andrew's kick drum starts to slide from the power of his
text: playing... His sheet music falls off its stand... His
text: crash cymbal almost falls over -- but a HAND reaches in
dialog: to steady it.
text: It’s Fletcher. Leaning over the drum set now -- and, for
text: almost the first time on-stage, not cursing or snarling at
dialog: Andrew, but instead--
speaker_heading: FLETCHER
dialog: Take it back to the snare...
text: Andrew considers this. It’s a good idea. He moves back to the
dialog: snare...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Slow...
dialog: (Andrew does as suggested)
dialog: Single-stroke...
text: Andrew nods again... Slowly simmers the beat down... Lets his
text: hi-hat hang open for a moment... Everything goes quiet...
text: Silence for a second... You can feel the hush, the
text: anticipation, that indescribable electricity in the air...
text: Fletcher looks at Andrew, looks at his sticks, face brimming
text: with hope now... Andrew begins a series of slow, clean snare
dialog: hits... Right stroke, left stroke, right, left...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Up... Up...
text: Andrew nods... Ever so gradually builds up the pace... Right,
text: left, right, left... Builds up the pace some more... Right,
text: left, right, left... Keeps going... Speeds up more, a hair at
text: a time... Right, left... Speeds up more.. Right, left...
text: Fletcher stands there, nodding, focused, like a coach at the
text: critical moment. Waves his hand, pushing Andrew on...
dialog: Pink (9/10/2013) 105
text: Andrew builds the tempo more, right, left, right, left, the
text: strokes blurring into each other, the whole thing sounding
text: like the fire of a machine gun, like what we heard in the
dialog: beginning... Right-left-right-left-right-left...
text: And, before we know it, we can no longer make out the
text: individual strokes. They’re so fast that all we can hear is a
text: single SOUND, sustained and growing in volume...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on... Come on...
text: Andrew, goaded on, builds the volume. His single-stroke roll
text: swelling, taking over the entire theater...
speaker_heading: FLETCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Come _on...!! Come on!!!
dialog: Andrew builds it further... Going beyond what even he’d
dialog: planned for himself -- his arms like machines, the single-
text: stroke roll building steam and power and pinning the audience
text: in their seats... Fletcher raising his hands, beckoning
text: Andrew forward... He and the drummer working together, player
dialog: and conductor, competitor and coach...
text: Andrew moves to the toms, then back to the snare, then back.
text: The bass drum and hi-hat next, every part of the set joining in,
text: every limb, every component, everything building up, up, up...
text: It’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen... Andrew tearing a hole
text: through the stage, his heartbeat racing, the sweat pouring from
text: him like a waterfall, blood gushing from his hands and staining
text: the cymbals and drum-heads... Everything a BLUR...
text: Then -- a BLAST OF SEPARATED SNARE HITS -- and then -- Andrew
text: CHOKES the crash cymbal. A second of pure silence.
text: Fletcher looks at Andrew. Andrew looks at Fletcher. And then --
text: Fletcher turns to the band, raises his hand...
text: ...and CUES THE FINAL NOTE.
text: The whole band roars it out, horns hitting their highest C’s,
text: and Andrew rolling around his drum set like a madman, cymbals
text: and snare and toms and the entire apparatus about to burst, as
text: WE DIVE IN CLOSE TO HIM, his instrument, his sticks, his face,
text: all sweat and eyes about to pop, the next Buddy Rich, the next
dialog: Charlie Parker -- Fletcher's only Charlie Parker -- decking
text: the stage with a climactic crash of cymbals right as, on that
dialog: very last hit of hits, we--
text: SMASH CUT TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
