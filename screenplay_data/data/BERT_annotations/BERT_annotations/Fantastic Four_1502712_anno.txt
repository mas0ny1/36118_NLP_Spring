speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: CLOSE ON A MASSIVE STEEL HEAD
text: Our first thought: DR. DOOM? But it's not moving. A
text: welder's torch sparks into frame in the hands of a sculptor
text: on scaffolding. This is art, an epic 20 foot statue going up
text: of a business mogul (VICTOR VON DOOM) in whose generously
text: extended hands sit two intertwined columns of DNA. His face
text: is chiseled, angular, perfect (too perfect). Past sparks, we
text: MOVE down to pick up...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET/VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY
text: REED RICHARDS and BEN GRIMM head toward the soaring glass-box
text: atrium of VDI Headquarters. Designed to inspire awe, it
dialog: does.
speaker_heading: REED
text: High open space, exposed structural
text: elements. Obviously aimed at first
dialog: time visitors to create feelings of...
dialog: smallness, inadequacy.
text: Ben glances at Reed, who looks a little nervous.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Good thing it ain't workin... Reed,
dialog: what are we doing here? This guy's
dialog: fast-food, strip-mall science --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: This wasn't our first stop, in case
dialog: you forgot NASA. And Victor's not
dialog: that bad. He's just a little...
dialog: (seeing the statue)
text: Larger than life.
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY
text: They move past the statue, into the sprawling atrium.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: He's financed some of the biggest
dialog: breakthroughs of this century.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You'd never know it.
text: He motions to a high-tech ORB, showing FOOTAGE of VDI's
dialog: accomplishments: a safe and clean nuclear facility, the first
dialog: private Space Station.
text: All images have VICTOR front and center, glad-handling George
dialog: Bush, Tony Blair, shady International Leaders. The last
text: image is Victor holding the AMERICA'S CUP.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus. That too?
text: They reach three stern RECEPTIONISTS.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see --
text: A receptionist cuts him off, handing them each a pass.
scene_heading: FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
text: Executive elevator, top floor.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What's the price for a smile round here?
text: They head for the elevator. Reed carries a small, black box.
text: As they enter the elevator, steel doors shut and we CUT TO --
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - OFFICE - DAY
text: A large, dark office. Ben in the corner. He yawns,
dialog: watches...
text: BRIGHT HOLOGRAMS: Stars. Planets. They hover in the air,
text: making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space.
speaker_heading: REED (O.S.)
dialog: My research suggests that exposure to
text: a high-energy cosmic storm born on
dialog: solar winds might have triggered the
dialog: evolution of early planetary life.
text: REED stands among the holograms, speaking to a MYSTERIOUS
text: FIGURE in shadow behind a desk. An ominous, PULSATING RED
text: CLOUD covers the stars. It washes over a hologram of EARTH.
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: In six weeks another cloud with the
dialog: same elemental profile will pass
dialog: Earth's orbit. A study in space could
dialog: advance our knowledge about the
dialog: structure of the human genome, and
dialog: help cure countless diseases, extend
dialog: human life --
text: The SHADOW clears his throat. Reed speeds up, emotional.
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: Give kids the chance to be stronger,
dialog: healthier, less prone to --
scene_heading: SHADOWED FIGURE
dialog: Turn it off. Please.
text: The figure's DEEP VOICE pierces the darkness.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: But I haven't fully explained my --
scene_heading: SHADOWED FIGURE
dialog: Yes you have... Imagination.
dialog: Creativity. Passion. Those were
dialog: always your trademarks.
text: Lights brighten, revealing the face behind the voice: VICTOR
text: VON DOOM. 35, handsome, commanding. He looks almost...
text: airbrushed. He drops a WIRED magazine to the desk. REED is
text: on the cover over the words: RICHARDS BANKRUPT, GRANT
speaker_heading: CUTBACKS.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: But dreams don't pay the bills, do
dialog: they?
dialog: (a condescending smile)
text: Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist.
text: Still reaching for the stars, with the
dialog: world on your back.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: You remember in school we talked about
dialog: working together. That's what I was
dialog: about to explain...
text: Reed presses the remote. Another hologram appears: A SHUTTLE
text: slowly approaching AN ORBITING SPACE STATION. Both bear the
text: VON DOOM INDUSTRIES logo. Victor smiles, more intrigued.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: So it's not my money you want. It's
dialog: my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn't
dialog: trust you, why should I?
text: Victor is a step ahead. Reed pauses, thrown for a beat. Ben
text: wakes up, suspicious. Victor notices. He notices
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: That's my job. To stay a step ahead.
dialog: To know what other men don't.
text: Ben gets close to Reed, turning toward the door.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I can't take this.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (low, quiet)
dialog: Ben. This is business. Just work.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Victor cracks a smile, enjoying the tension. And...
speaker_heading: SUE (O.S.)
dialog: He's right, Ben.
text: They turn to see...SUE STORM (demure, stunning) standing in a
dialog: corner...possibly for the whole presentation. A little cold:
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's just business.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I think you both know my Director of
dialog: Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Heya Susie.
dialog: (under breath, to Reed)
dialog: One more thing he's got.
text: Sue gracefully walks into the office, only taking her eyes
text: off of Reed to give Ben a warm hug.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Ben, it's been too long.
text: She gives Reed a polite handshake. Victor watches carefully.
text: Reed looks uncomfortable in her gaze. A little tongue-tied.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: You're, you've, I mean, how have you
dialog: bee--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Never better.
text: Victor sizes them up. He puts a hand on Sue's shoulder.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: This isn't going to be a problem, is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Ancient history.
text: Victor smiles, eyeing Sue.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Good. Then you're just in time to
dialog: hear the great Reed Richards ask me
dialog: for help.
dialog: (to Reed)
dialog: You know, you made a lot of folks at
dialog: MIT feel like a junior high science
dialog: fair. So you'll excuse me if I savor
dialog: the moment.
text: Ben tightens. A hard beat. Reed sucks it up.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: You back this mission, and I'll sign
dialog: over a fair percentage of any
dialog: applications or --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: The number's seventy-five. And it's
dialog: applications and patents.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What about his first born?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Ben, the money's not important. We
dialog: could save lives.
text: Sue gives a thin smile -- a flicker of old feelings.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Twenty-five percent of a billion is
dialog: enough to keep the lights on, isn't
dialog: it? Maybe even pay off your fourth
dialog: mortgage on the Baxter Building.
text: They look at Victor. How does he know all this...?
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Deal...?
text: Reed looks at Ben, who shakes his head softly no. But
text: Reed...drops a nod. Done. Victor smiles, offers a
text: handshake.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Well then, to our future. Together.
text: Victor squeezes. Hard. His other hand on Sue's shoulder.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Hilarious.
text: As Reed and Sue lock eyes, Ben watches Victor. Wary.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
text: Director of Communications LEONARD enters, checking files.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: If Reed's right, then this little trip
dialog: will double our stock offering.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: And if he's not...?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Reed's always right. Good thing he
dialog: doesn't always know what he's got...
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Reed and Ben step into the elevator.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: He knew about NASA. What if he made
dialog: the call to shut us down --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Ben, think about all the people we can
dialog: help if this works --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Maybe you should think about yourself
dialog: for once. You always let this guy
dialog: push you round --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: We got what we wanted. That's
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I know, I know. I'm just worried
dialog: about what he wants... Speaking of
dialog: which...
text: Reed follows Ben's eyes to...SUE. She joins them. Doors
dialog: shut.
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You sure about this, Reed?
text: He nods, head down. He doesn't want eye contact.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Those solar winds are flaring, but I
dialog: factored them into my coordinates and --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I was talking about us. Working
dialog: together.
text: Sue holds her eyes on Reed. He is clearly uncomfortable in
text: her gaze. Did the elevator just get smaller?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (thinking, talking fast)
dialog: Well, uh, based on our history...you
dialog: can handle the biogenetics, and I'll
dialog: focus on the molecular physics. Or,
dialog: uhm, maybe I should take the biotech,
dialog: you work the microscopes, since you
dialog: have some background in electropho--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (droll, a little annoyed)
dialog: Right. That's exactly what I meant.
text: She shakes her head -- same old Reed. He looks at her --
text: what did he say wrong? Ben smiles, patting Reed on the
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Way to not overthink it.
dialog: (to Sue)
dialog: So when do we leave?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I'll schedule the launch. Call me in
dialog: the morning to talk about resources
dialog: and crew.
text: She offers a business card. Reed doesn't take it.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I, uh, think I remember the number.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It's been changed.
text: Beat. Ben grimaces. Reed takes the card, his eyes down.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could
dialog: pilot the mission --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun,
dialog: but we already have a pilot on our
dialog: payroll. You remember my brother
dialog: Johnny...
text: Off Ben's curdling smile, we DISSOLVE TO --
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY
text: A helicopter shot through trees. We soar over timberland,
text: and find something massive looming on the horizon:
text: A SPACECRAFT. A sleek take on a space shuttle. Modern tech
dialog: combined with industrial design that NASA could never afford.
text: The craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch.
text: WORKERS IN JUMPSUITS are scattered around the two-hundred
text: foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks.
scene_heading: EXT. GANTRY OVERLOOK - DAY
text: Ben stares up at the craft. A sneer on his face.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Can't do it. I cannot do it.
speaker_heading: REED
text: External SRBs, orbital system engines.
dialog: Its just like the shuttles you flew
dialog: in --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No. I cannot take orders from that
dialog: underwear model. That wingnut washed
dialog: out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria
text: Secret wannabes into a flight
text: simulator.
speaker_heading: REED
text: Youthful high spirits.
text: They walk toward the base of the scaffolding.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: They crashed it into a wall. A flight
text: simulator.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I'm sure he's matured since then.
text: CLOSE on JOHNNY STORM, leaning over to kiss a hot redhead.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL he's riding a MOTORCYCLE, and she's
text: driving a red CORVETTE with license plate: FRANKIE. PICK UP
text: Reed and Ben, watching through binoculars.
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: When have I asked you to do something
dialog: you absolutely said you could not do?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Five times.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I had it at four.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: This makes five.
scene_heading: INT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
text: Reed and Ben unpack gear into lockers. Suddenly --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (O.S.)
dialog: Captain on the bridge!
text: Ben goes to attention on reflex: Johnny snaps a picture with
text: a digital camera. Then advances, as Ben realizes who it
dialog: is...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Digital camera: $254. Memory stick:
dialog: $59. The look on your hard-ass former
dialog: CO's grill when he finds out he's your
dialog: junior officer: priceless.
text: Ben eyeballs Johnny, suddenly reaches up as if to grab him.
text: Johnny flinches. But Ben just reaches for Johnny's zipper,
text: adjusts his uniform.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I can handle the ship. I can even
dialog: handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I
dialog: don't know if I should be flying or
dialog: playing Vegas in these suits. Who the
dialog: hell came up with them?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Victor did.
text: Sue enters, wearing her blue, wetsuit-like uniform, carrying
text: a stack of flightsuits. She hands them out to the guys.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: The synthetics act as a second skin,
dialog: adapting to your individual needs to --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Keep the hot side hot, and the cool
dialog: side cool!
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Wow. Fantastic.
text: Reed stares at Sue in the skintight outfit. She wonders,
dialog: maybe hopes -- is he actually checking her out?
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: Material made from self-regulating
dialog: unstable molecules. I've been working
dialog: on a formula for this.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Great minds think alike.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (O.S.)
dialog: Guess some think faster than others.
text: Victor enters, wearing his custom-tailored flightsuit.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I hired Armani to design the pattern.
dialog: These colors will look great on
dialog: camera.
text: A DOOR OPENS. Leonard enters, in a sharp suit.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: They're ready for you, sir.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Showtime.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - HALLS - NIGHT
text: Leonard leads Victor through the halls. Victor checks
text: himself in mirrors as he walks, fixing his hair, his uniform.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Our numbers are through the roof. The
dialog: IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a
dialog: share. The bank's five times
dialog: oversubscribed --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It's not just the money. I could make
dialog: money in my sleep.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Then what is it?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: History, Leonard. History.
dialog: Everything else is conversation...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: How's the other matter?
text: Leonard pulls out a BOX. Opens it: a TEN KARAT DIAMOND RING.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
text: Harry Winston sends his regards.
text: They hit a set of big doors. Victor stops and looks into the
text: reflective, metallic surface on the wall. He fixes one last
text: strand of hair. Perfect. Then he opens the door to...
text: SNAP!SNAP!SNAP! WHIP-PAN a row of CAMERAS snapping shots of --
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - NIGHT
text: Retrofitted into a makeshift press area. Victor sits on a
text: platform, with reporters stretched out below him.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Today we stand on the edge of a new
text: frontier. In the furthest depths of
dialog: outer space...we will find the secrets
dialog: to inner space. The final key to
dialog: unlocking our genetic code lies in a
dialog: cosmic storm...
text: BEHIND THE ACTION: Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben walk past. News
text: crews barely notice, passing without even taking a picture.
dialog: Our "Fantastic Four" are not exactly big news. Not yet.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Isn't that your speech?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: He's made a few changes.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: This is your dream, Reed. You should
dialog: be the one up there.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Victor's better at these things.
text: Just past the press area, they see...one woman standing,
text: waiting. This is DEBBIE, Ben's fiancée. And for the first
text: time in the entire film...Ben SMILES. They hug, kissing.
text: Johnny and Reed watch. Reed glances at Sue, who walks ahead.
text: Debbie slips a photo into Ben's flightsuit. A tender beat.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'll be watching over you.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Just get back soon, or I start looking
dialog: for a new groom.
text: Ben looks at the little ENGAGEMENT RING on her finger.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that
dialog: in for a bigger rock.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't care about rocks, I care about
dialog: you.
dialog: (to Reed)
dialog: You bring him back in one piece, or
dialog: you can forget being Best Man.
text: Reed nods, smiles. Debbie gives Ben a last kiss. Ben turns
text: to Johnny, who gives a cocky smile.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What the hell you smiling at? Just
dialog: keep your mouth shut, and your mind on
dialog: those SMBs --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Actually, the engines are SMEs.
dialog: Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant.
dialog: Couple generations past your last
dialog: ride.
dialog: (at the threshold)
dialog: I'm not as dumb as you look.
text: Ben just glares at Reed. This is going to be a long trip.
text: As they follow after Sue, we CUT BACK TO --
speaker_heading: VICTOR ON STAGE
text: Mid-speech. Playing behind him is REED'S HOLOGRAM: stars
text: give way to a pulsating red cloud...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Think of a world without genetic flaws
dialog: -- no asthma, allergies, baldness,
dialog: breast cancer...
text: Ben and Reed hear the speech. Ben bristles.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What's wrong with being bald...?
text: Victor smiles at the crowd, commanding. A true leader.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Darwin discovered evolution. Now we --
dialog: I -- will define it. Only in America
dialog: could...
text: The red cloud of cosmic rays wash over the Earth.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...a little country boy from Latveria
dialog: build one of the biggest companies in
text: the world, and truly reach the stars.
dialog: Now if you'll excuse me, history
dialog: awaits...
text: On those words, the HOLOGRAM TRANSFORMS TO...Von Doom's
text: SHUTTLE on the launch pad. BOOM! THRUSTERS FIRE WHITE HOT.
text: Smoke billows across the pad. Ready for take off.
text: Victor walks past the hologram and exits. His departure
text: perfectly timed with the shuttle LIFTING OFF.
text: We push in on the shuttle, and follow the ship as it leaves
text: Earth's atmosphere. BOOM -- booster rockets fall away and
text: the shuttle fires its thrusters. The hologram transitions
dialog: to...
text: A shot of the SPACE STATION high above the Earth. The
text: shuttle enters from the top, lighting up the hologram with
text: engines afire. As the shuttle approaches the station we CUT
dialog: TO --
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP SPACE - SAME
text: THE SPACE STATION in the distance, rotating in orbit above
text: Earth. THE SHUTTLE eases in and docks.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME
text: Victor and Sue lead the others into the command center.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (a "dad voice": to Ben)
dialog: If you behave, maybe next time
dialog: daddy'll let you drive.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Keep talking, there won't be a next
dialog: time.
text: Reed is focused on THE EARTH.
speaker_heading: SUE
text: Long way from the projection booth at
dialog: the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it?
text: Reed turns towards her -- a little stunned that she would
text: bring that up. It's the first time she's been nice to him so
text: far. He smiles, gently, hesitantly, always hesitant with
dialog: Sue.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Yes. Yes it is.
text: Johnny and Ben exchange a look. Reed keeps looking at the
text: stars, eyes wide, like a little kid.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME
text: They enter the nerve center of the space station. Victor
text: goes to a computer console on the observation deck below.
text: The windows are closed, so there's nothing to observe.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: (to ground; via comm-link)
dialog: Leonard, how's the feed?
speaker_heading: LEONARD (V.O.)
dialog: Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
text: Victor glances at a camera mounted into the console.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We can monitor the cloud's approach
dialog: and observe the tests from here.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Is it safe?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: The shields on the station should
dialog: protect us.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Should?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What's wrong, Ben? Eighty-million
dialog: dollars worth of equipment not enough
dialog: for you?
text: Ben turns to Victor. A little tension. Reed cuts it:
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Let's start loading those samples.
dialog: Get your suit ready, Ben.
text: Victor keeps his eyes on Ben.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: So you still do all the heavy lifting?
text: Victor gives a friendly smile, patting Reed.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe you should have stayed back in
dialog: the lab. Field work never suited you.
text: Reed doesn't defend himself. Ben steps up.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: He does the talking. I do the
dialog: walking. Got it?
text: Victor holds tight to his smile. He nods, condescending.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Got it. So take a walk, Ben...I'm
text: going to borrow Susan for a second.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Sure.
text: Ben and Johnny read his eyes, as we CUT TO --
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - LATER
text: Ben preps for a space walk, putting on a helmet and boots.
text: Johnny unloads a set of clear sample boxes off of a cart,
text: each containing a variety of plants.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Please tell me your dawg's not trying
dialog: to rekindle things with my sister.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: 'Course not. Strictly business.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Hey, two hearts got busted last time.
text: Maybe she's not over it either.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the
dialog: year, more coin than God? Or Reed,
dialog: the world's dumbest smart guy worth
dialog: less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's
text: a toss-up.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Put your tiny little mind at ease.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Don't you wander off, boy.
text: Johnny steps out of the air-lock and shuts the door. He
text: looks through a small window to see Ben give the thumbs up.
text: THE AIRLOCK DOOR opens, and Ben gracefully steps into space.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME
text: Sue descends the stairs at Victor's behest. Joins him.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I understand the business reasons.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Well, when you're looking at your
dialog: future, it never hurts to find closure
dialog: about the past.
text: Sue's eyes narrow. What is this about...?
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Susan, every man dreams that he'll
dialog: meet some woman he can give the world
dialog: to.
text: He presses a button and the observation deck's outer windows
text: open up, revealing a spectacular, romantic view of the EARTH.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: In my case, it's not just a metaphor.
text: While she stares out the window, Victor reaches into a
text: pocket, revealing a RING BOX. Sue looks unsettled.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - NEARBY CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
text: Reed checks data on a work station, set on a wall. The
dialog: results of his calculations are not what he expected... He
text: sees WIND VELOCITY digits rise. He does a double-take when
text: he sees the readout: EVENT THRESHOLD, T-MINUS 10:00.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: No...no...impossible. It's...too
dialog: fast.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME
text: Behind his back, Victor holds the ring box in hand.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You've been with me two years now.
text: Sue doesn't know where this is going. She treads lightly.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It's been a good two years, Victor...
dialog: The company's accomplished so much.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Right, of course, the company... But
dialog: you see, I've come to realize all the
dialog: accomplishments in the world mean
dialog: nothing without someone to share them
dialog: with --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done
dialog: something to make you think...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of
dialog: taking big steps. And this is the
dialog: biggest step yet. If it helps, think
dialog: of this as a promotion. A merger of
dialog: sorts...
dialog: (getting closer)
dialog: Four little words that can change our
dialog: lives...
text: He is about to spring the ring on her. She looks like a deer
text: in headlights. She opens her mouth, and...WHAM! Doors slam
text: open. REED RUSHES INTO THE ROOM.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: The cloud is accelerating!
text: Victor quickly puts the ring back in his pocket.
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what happened.
text: Sue quickly moves to a nearby control panel to verify Reed's
text: claim. Starts punching buttons. Confirms Reed's findings
text: with a nod. Victor hardens, in control.
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: We've got minutes until it hits, not
dialog: hours...Victor, that storm's deadly --
dialog: the radiation's lethal. We need to
dialog: abort.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all
dialog: this way to lose our nerve at the
dialog: first little glitch. Just close the
dialog: shields...
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Ben's still out there --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: So reel him in. But we came here to
dialog: do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE STATION - MOMENTS LATER
text: Ben is carefully arranging SAMPLE BOXES OF PLANTS.
speaker_heading: REED (ON RADIO)
dialog: Ben, we need you back inside.
text: Ben turns to see Reed and Johnny staring from a window.
speaker_heading: BEN (INTO RADIO)
dialog: I ain't done arranging your flowers,
dialog: egghead.
speaker_heading: REED (ON RADIO)
dialog: Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
text: Ben sees Johnny motioning for Ben to look behind him. Ben
text: turns and sees: THE COSMIC STORM, rumbling toward the
text: station. Not close, but not far. That gets Ben's attention.
speaker_heading: BEN (INTO RADIO)
dialog: Roger that, on my way.
text: He turns back towards the ship. BEHIND HIM, the storm grows.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME TIME
text: Victor rushes into the room, looks at the monitors. Sees the
text: others near the airlock on one screen, and the approaching
text: cloud on another. Anxiety creeps across his face.
speaker_heading: AUTOMATED VOICE
dialog: Event threshold in two minutes.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME
text: Reed and Johnny stand by the airlock, waiting for Ben. They
text: heard the automated voice. It panics Reed.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Come on, Ben, come on...
speaker_heading: VICTOR (ON RADIO)
dialog: Reed, we're running out of time.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTER SPACE - MOMENTS LATER
text: A wake of turbulence from the cloud hits Ben, making it
text: harder to maneuver. The cloud's tendrils snake toward him.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME
text: They can see Ben outside the window, still twenty yards away.
text: The entire corridor rumbles. Lights flicker and spark. They
text: watch helplessly.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME
text: Sue watches the monitor, also helpless.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Johnny... Reed...
text: Victor, annoyed by the indecisiveness, marches right up to
text: Sue. Practically shoves her aside as he hits the INTERCOM.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Reed, you need to get up here so we
dialog: can close the shields! Now!
text: Sue glares at Victor. His lack of compassion shocks her.
speaker_heading: REED (ON RADIO)
dialog: Not until Ben is back inside!
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It's too late for him, and soon it'll
dialog: be too late for all of us.
text: Victor doesn't bother to wait for a response. He takes over
text: the console, punching keys.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
text: Raising the shields.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You can't leave them out there.
text: Sue glares with as much contempt as her face can muster.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Watch me. Reed had his chance. You
dialog: can't help them any more than I can.
text: Beat. She takes a step toward the door. Not sure what to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I can try.
text: With one final glare, she bolts from the room.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME
text: Reed bites his lip. Thinks. He decides.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Victor's right. Johnny, get to the
text: command center. Close the shields.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What about you?
text: One look from Reed tells Johnny, he won't leave without Ben.
text: Johnny eyes Ben, steels his courage. He's not going either.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Ben)
dialog: Come on big guy, you can do it!
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY
text: Victor watches the shields slide down. Alone. An island.
speaker_heading: AUTOMATED VOICE
dialog: Event threshold in thirty seconds.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - CORRIDOR - SAME TIME
text: Sue races down the hall. Not panicked. With determination.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK - DAY
text: The exterior air lock door slides open. In agonizing,
text: weightless slow motion Ben reaches to haul himself inside.
text: The leading edge of the cloud hits: Ben is pelted by a
text: hissing mass of space dust, splattering his suit with orange
text: stains. Larger particles, small pellets, pepper him. Ben
text: hauls himself in the last few feet by pulling on his tether.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK/COMMAND CENTER - DAY
speaker_heading: AUTOMATED VOICE
dialog: Event threshold in ten seconds.
dialog: TEN...
text: Johnny punches controls to close the exterior airlock door...
text: Reed opens a first aid kit, grabs a thermo-elastic blanket...
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME
text: Clutching the diamond ring, Victor stands defiantly. Showing
dialog: absolutely no concern for the others. Interested only in the
text: event itself. Lights and equipment FALL, CRASHING around
dialog: him.
text: A control panel EXPLODES in Victor's face. He jumps back,
text: and into the falling equipment. Collapses under the weight.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - SAME TIME
text: Sue rounds a corner, sees Reed and Johnny.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Johnny! Reed!
speaker_heading: AUTOMATED VOICE
scene_heading: FIVE...FOOOOUUUR...
text: SLOW MOTION: Everyone frozen in position as:
text: -- JOHNNY is hit with sparks of flame from a control panel.
text: -- REED REACHES out for Ben and the airlock door.
text: -- VAPOR STREAM pours down on Sue from a blown gasket.
text: -- THE SPACE DUST burns into Ben's skin.
text: SLOW MOTION: Just BEFORE the exterior air-lock door closes, a
text: SINGLE PARTICLE zips through the narrowing gap and hits Ben
text: in the back, ripping through his suit. The exterior door
text: shuts and seals. The station loses all power. DARKNESS.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE STATION - DAY
text: As quickly as it came, the cloud passes on and whirls away,
text: leaving the space station intact. Power quietly flickers on.
text: Silence. Time resumes. All four pick up exactly where they
text: left off, unaware of anything that just happened to them.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY
text: Victor emerges from the rubble. He stands, checks his body.
text: A few scrapes, nothing serious. A thin, throbbing CUT on his
text: head. He touches the wound, but it is not bleeding.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK - DAY
text: Reed and Johnny scramble to open the interior air lock door.
text: Sue joins them, as they pull Ben in. They try to remove his
text: helmet. We don't see his face, but he's clearly unconscious.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: He's not responsive --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Ben! Ben!
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
scene_heading: A BLACK SCREEN:
speaker_heading: JOHNNY'S VOICE
dialog: Ben, wake up! Wake up!
scene_heading: SUBJECTIVE CAMERA, BEN'S POV: The blurry image of Johnny
text: comes slowly into focus, standing beside a hospital bed.
speaker_heading: BEN (O.S.)
dialog: Where...where am I?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
text: Back on Earth. Victor's medical
dialog: facility... We're in quarantine.
speaker_heading: BEN (O.S.)
dialog: Reed? ... Sue?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: They're fine. Everybody else...is
dialog: fine.
text: Johnny looks away, as if he can't bear to lay eyes on him.
speaker_heading: BEN (O.S.)
dialog: What's wrong with me?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I swear to you they've done everything
dialog: humanly possible. The best plastic
dialog: surgeons in the world, Ben. You had
dialog: the best --
speaker_heading: BEN (O.S.)
dialog: Give me a mirror...
text: Johnny picks up a hand mirror on the bed table before Ben can
text: reach it, reluctant to give it to him.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: They said that's not such a good idea,
dialog: the shock alone could --
speaker_heading: BEN (O.S.)
dialog: Give me the god damn mirror!
text: Ben grabs it from him. Then slowly raises it to look and see
text: that...except for some serious stubble, Ben's totally normal.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Unfortunately, the doctors just
dialog: couldn't do anything to fix your face!
text: He cackles as he heads for the door. Ben heaves the mirror
text: at him, breaking it into hundreds of pieces. He turns to the
text: side-table, and grabs that picture of DEBBIE. It calms him.
scene_heading: EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING - DAY
text: A modern facility of glass and stone, nestled in the forest.
text: In stark contrast to the lush greenery surrounding it.
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL CORRIDOR/SUE'S ROOM - DAY
text: Reed walks down the hall. His hair is GRAYING at the
text: temples. He passes Johnny, who is smiling, still enjoying
text: his joke on Ben. Johnny slows, looking at Reed's hair.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Nice 'do. Going for the "grandpa"
dialog: look?
text: Reed passes a mirror, slowing, seeing his gray hairs. He
text: keeps going. He passes a partially open door. He stops when
text: he catches a glimpse of Sue asleep in bed. He sees a vase of
text: flowers. He grabs a couple lilies, and enters.
text: But Reed sees...the room is already FILLED with expensive
text: flowers. All from VICTOR. Reed is trumped once again.
text: A DOCTOR writes on Sue's chart. A wall TV plays a press
text: conference with Victor, outside the FACILITY. He looks worse
text: for wear. A few hairs out of place, and a small BANDAGE on
text: his face. We PUSH INTO the press conference --
speaker_heading: REPORTER #1
dialog: You've been accused in the past of
dialog: moving science a little too fast --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Accused by who? My competitors?
speaker_heading: REPORTER #2
dialog: But surely this accident gives you
dialog: pause --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Danger is always part of discovery.
dialog: What would have happened if Ben
dialog: Franklin never went out in a storm?
dialog: Without risk, there's no reward.
speaker_heading: REPORTER #3
dialog: So where's the reward? You promised a
dialog: cure-all.
text: Victor pauses. For the first time. Just a flicker.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: And you'll have it. I've never come
dialog: up short. And I'm not going to start
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: REPORTER #2
dialog: So you're still taking VDI public --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Yes, of course. I've never been more
dialog: confident in the compan--
text: Reed mutes the television.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: How's she doing?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Stable. Vitals are strong.
text: Reed takes the clipboard, looks for himself.
speaker_heading: REED
text: Blood panels show no irradiation.
dialog: Good. You'll step up this protocol,
dialog: every --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Four hours. We know what we're
dialog: doing... One more day of observation,
dialog: then you're all cleared.
text: The Doctor takes his clipboard, and walks out. Reed steps to
text: Sue, with the drooping flowers in his hand. Quiet:
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Sue...I want to tell you...I'm...
text: WHOOSH. A NURSE rolls in with a tray bearing ten more
text: extravagant bouquets. Reed looks resigned. He walks out.
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: She's allergic to orchids. Put that
text: Amaryllis Apapathos by her bed. The
dialog: African lilies? They're her
dialog: favorites.
text: Reed exits, dropping his two wilted lilies into the trash.
text: Sue opens one eye, as the big lilies land by the bed.
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: A SEXY NURSE wheels a testing station into Johnny's room.
text: He's stripped down to Calvins, changing into a ski outfit.
speaker_heading: SEXY NURSE
dialog: And where do we think we're going?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I don't know if "we've" noticed, but
dialog: the sickest runs this side of the Alps
dialog: are right outside that window --
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I've noticed... But doctor's orders,
dialog: you're not allowed to leave until we --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Finish the tests, I know -- could you
dialog: give me a hand with this zipper?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You know this is not a ski resort.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Not yet.
text: Johnny opens the cardboard box, revealing a colorful
text: fiberglass object the size of a briefcase. In the blink of
text: an eye, he unfolds it into a LONG SNOWBOARD.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Luckily grandma still sends care
dialog: packages.
text: The nurse pops a thermometer in his mouth to shut him up.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You are trouble.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (thermometer in his mouth)
dialog: Brubbles my Triddle Name.
text: They both pay more attention to his zipper than the digital
text: read-out: it runs right up past 98.6, then accelerates fast.
speaker_heading: SEXY NURSE
dialog: You're hot!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: So are you!
speaker_heading: SEXY NURSE
dialog: I mean, you feel a little feverish.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I've never felt better in my life.
dialog: When do you get off work?
speaker_heading: SEXY NURSE
dialog: My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Meet me at 4:01, top of the run.
dialog: That'll give you a minute to freshen
dialog: up.
text: He hands her the thermometer, a quick kiss and he's out the
text: door. The machine beeps: Johnny's temperature is 209
speaker_heading: DEGREES.
scene_heading: EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL PATIO - DAY
text: Ben finds Reed on a patio with a panoramic view. Reed works
text: at a laptop computer.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: How long was I out?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Three days. I was worried about you.
dialog: How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Solid.
text: Ben can see Reed doesn't look too solid.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: How you doing?
text: Reed shakes his head, looking back at his screen.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I don't know. I just keep going over
dialog: and over the numbers.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Reed. Even you can't compute every
dialog: little thing.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I should have done more, run more
dialog: tests --
text: Ben gets closer, pushing down Reed's computer screen.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It was a freak of nature. Last I
dialog: checked, you don't have a crystal
dialog: ball. Let it go.
text: Reed considers. But he can't let it go. He opens his
text: computer back up, returning to work. Ben shakes his head,
text: looks out at the view. His eyes catch on something, wheels
dialog: turning.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You go through something like this,
dialog: makes you appreciate having the right
dialog: woman in your life.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
text: Reed follows Ben's eyes to a lower level patio: SUE.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: What? Come on. She's got a good
dialog: thing with Victor --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen
dialog: your screws?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: He's smart, powerful, successful --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well maybe you should date him.
text: Reed looks at Ben, resigned.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Ben. He'll give her the life she
dialog: deserves. She ended up with the right
dialog: guy. Things worked out for the best.
text: Reed steps away. Ben stands alone, an idea sparking.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Do I have to do everything myself?
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER/EXT. MOUNTAIN SUMMIT - DAY
text: The chopper hovers over this pristine peak. JOHNNY and his
text: NURSE sit in the chopper-bay, prepping their ski gear.
text: Johnny's customized snowboard has wild, acrylic patterns.
text: His Nurse wears a hot pink cat-suit, her skis dangling out.
text: Their bodies are close: a sexy, competitive flirtation. They
text: look down at a death-defying black diamond run.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Me like-y.
speaker_heading: SEXY NURSE
dialog: Stay right. Left is trouble.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I though we went over this.
speaker_heading: SEXY NURSE
dialog: Last one down springs for room
dialog: service.
text: She pulls down her goggles, jumps out. Johnny drops out
text: after her, hitting the snow. He smolders: literally. The
text: snow bank behind him sizzles and starts to melt.
text: He takes off after her and the chase is on:
scene_heading: EXT. BLACK DIAMOND RUN - DAY
text: The Nurse knows every inch of the trail, slicing expertly in
text: and out of the trees through deep powder. Johnny's a speed
text: freak, maximizing velocity, closing the gap between them.
text: Ghostly FLAMES shoot off his hair: his ski cap catches fire,
text: flies off. Jets of fire knife through the back of his jacket.
text: The Nurse looks back: In a burst of speed, Johnny draws even.
text: She looks over and sees the flames shooting out behind him...
speaker_heading: SEXY NURSE
dialog: You're on fire!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Not this again --
speaker_heading: SEXY NURSE
dialog: No: You're ON FIRE!
text: Johnny sees his gloves are burning, flicks them off in alarm.
text: His body SHUDDERS: the back of his ski suit catches on fire.
text: A burst of flame launches him down the slope like a rocket.
text: Nurse loses concentration, falls. Johnny races away like a
text: missile, screaming in exhilaration. He looks back -- no
dialog: nurse.
text: He tries to put out his flaming clothes, and accidentally
text: VEERS to the LEFT. He fails to notice the giant CHASM in
text: front of him. He faces forward and...
text: SCREEAAMMS! LAUNCHING off the cliff, LEGS FLAILING, trying
text: to catch ground. FLAMES begin to TRAIL his body as he FALLS
text: towards the rocks below. He tries to will his body away.
text: Instead, his body becomes engulfed in flame. He is a HUMAN
text: TORCH! And for a moment he HOLDS THE AIR -- the fire giving
text: him some kind of...LIFT. He maneuvers just over the rocks,
text: almost making a 90 degree turn.
text: He looks back at the rocks in disbelief. But the lift
text: doesn't last long. He quickly CRASHES, landing HARD into a
text: snowbank.
text: He opens his eyes; tries to move but can't. He's trapped
text: under snow and ice. With all his strength, he tries to move,
text: NO DICE. Panic sets in. His eyes go wide as the snow around
text: quickly begins to melt. Johnny is on fire, and within
text: seconds he's sitting in a small POND, steam rising from the
dialog: water.
text: The nurse races toward the steam. Scared, panicked. She
text: finds Johnny...smiling, sitting naked in an impromptu hot
text: tub, staring at his hands. His body. Exhilarated.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Care to join me?
text: She smiles and unzips. The FLAMES DISSOLVE TO...CANDLES IN --
scene_heading: EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
text: On an expansive parapet with a billion-dollar view, Victor
text: prepares a romantic dinner-setting as his staff scurry about.
text: He checks every fork and knife, with a slightly manic energy.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: How's the IPO?
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Stable. We're looking at low
dialog: twenties. It's a good number,
dialog: considering the fallout from --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Reed's disaster. You know, I half-
dialog: think he did this to me on purpose.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
text: But Victor is on to the next thought, always strategizing.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Get me on the AM shows, Larry King,
dialog: cover of the Journal...
dialog: (staring into silver tray)
dialog: I've got to do something about this
dialog: scar. Make sure they only shoot my
dialog: right side.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Actually, uh, people seem to think the
dialog: scar "humanizes" you.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: And that's a good thing?
text: Victor looks at the scar, enraged by this defect. It
text: glistens in the silver tray. His eyes are bloodshot,
dialog: sleepless.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: You know, maybe you should get some
dialog: rest --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Later. First, I've got some
text: unfinished business. A deal that
dialog: needs closing...
text: Leonard looks at the table, the lavish spread. A beat.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue?
dialog: You could have any woman in the world
dialog: but --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: That's why. Because I could have
dialog: any other woman... You know, when
dialog: they asked Caesar "why England," he
dialog: said, "because it's not mine."
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Two dozen EMPLOYEES sit and eat. Others serve themselves at
text: the buffet. Ben and Sue walking into the dining hall --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I can only stay for one drink, Ben.
dialog: I've got to meet with Victor.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
text: They turn a corner and find Reed, entering by another door.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey Reed, what are you doing here?
dialog: (before he can answer)
dialog: Great, why don't you join us?
text: He quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table.
text: Ben's stomach GROWLS; so loud that they all can hear it.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: God, I'm starving. Gonna hit the
dialog: buffet.
text: Ben's stomach growls again, even louder this time.
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - EVENING
text: The sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners. The
text: room is darker, more romantic. Ben finishes the last shrimp
text: on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Pardon me...
text: Sue and Reed stare at him. Ben's stomach growls again.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I think I need to lie down. Bad
dialog: shrimp.
text: This was Ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well,
text: unsteady when he walks away. He looks down at his stomach.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Really bad shrimp.
text: ANGLE: Fireplace. Sue looks gorgeous in the light. A beat.
text: A long beat. Reed doesn't know where to start with this
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Feeling better?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yes, thanks.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: That's good. That's uh...good.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You always had a way with words.
dialog: (an awkward beat)
dialog: I should be getting back.
text: Sue gets up to leave. Exasperated, Reed tries to think of
dialog: something, anything, to say.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I'm really happy for you and Victor.
text: She slows down, looking at him. She was hoping for more.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You're happy for me and Victor.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I can tell you guys are enjoying what
dialog: was the best part of our relationship --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Which was?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Passion.
text: We see surprise on Sue's face, and...
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: For science.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: You are such a dork, Reed... You never
dialog: got it and never will unless it's
dialog: explained to you in quantum physics.
text: As if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around
text: her BENDS. The flames flicker in a ghostly breeze.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: What? What did I say?
text: She looks more disappointed than angry.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It's never what you say. It's what
dialog: you don't say. What you don't do...
dialog: She lets that hang. A lot of history here. Quiet, hurt --
text: she wants Reed to fight for her, to show some emotion.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I...I...I just wanted to --
text: As Sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It's been two years, and all you can
dialog: say is you're happy for me and some
dialog: other guy...
dialog: (standing up, hurt)
dialog: You know, Victor may be a lot of
dialog: things, but at least he's not afraid
dialog: to fight for what he wants...
dialog: (Reed looks down)
dialog: And it's nice to be wanted sometimes.
dialog: To be heard...seen... Reed, look at
dialog: me.
text: He looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her
text: cheek and her bewitching eyes. He drops his fork, shocked.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Uh, Sue...? I can't.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What? What do you mean you --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Sue...look at your hands.
text: She raises her hands, but we don't see them. We only see a
text: medical waistband...floating. Her watch...floating. Her
text: clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air.
text: Sue is invisible. She shrieks and gets up -- knocking a
text: GLASS off the table...
text: SLOW MOTION: The glass flies off the table, tumbling... Reed
text: instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two
text: feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits --
text: Then snaps back into place. Reed stares at his arm in
text: disbelief. Sue's eyes widen as well. The rest of Sue
text: reappears. They look at each other: mutual alarm.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (O.S.)
dialog: You guys will not believe what just
dialog: happened!
text: They look up to see JOHNNY in the doorway, NAKED except for
text: the nurse's PINK PARKA wrapped around his midsection.
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING
text: CLUNK. The candles burn low on the table. Victor strides
text: out, heading for the door. He runs his hand through his hair
text: to comb some strays. A CLUMP comes off in his fingers. He
text: PAUSES. He steps to a mirror, stares at his hair. His SCAR.
text: It is longer than the bandage now (as if it SPREAD). Victor
text: peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray.
text: Deep, unhealthy, maybe infected...
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - HALLWAY - EARLY EVENING
text: DOUBLE DOORS burst open. Reed, Sue, and Johnny urgently
dialog: walk.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It has to be the cloud. It's
dialog: fundamentally altered our DNA.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Let's not jump to conclusions, we need
text: a massive amount of evidence before
dialog: making that leap.
text: Reed glances over his shoulder. He stares. Sue follows his
text: gaze to see: Johnny's FINGERTIPS are on fire. He SNAPS his
text: fingers. They GO OUT. He's totally unharmed.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Now what is up with that?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: The cloud has fundamentally altered
dialog: our DNA.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Apparently I can disappear.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Please tell me you go silent too.
dialog: Only one thing on Reed's mind --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: We have to find Ben.
scene_heading: EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: Johnny snaps his fingers -- which generate small explosive
text: bursts of flame. He turns it on and off, like the "CLAPPER."
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame
dialog: off --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Johnny.
text: He does it again. Flame on, flame off.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Okay, "mom."
text: Reed's about to knock on Ben's door when he hears the
text: banging, moaning and pleading inside. Johnny smiles.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my
dialog: nurse!
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING
speaker_heading: REED (O.S.)
dialog: Ben, are you there?
text: A creepy rippling movement begins beneath the sheet and
text: gradually intensifies, reflected in the fabric's surface: the
text: contours of Ben's body are changing, inflating, growing rough
text: and craggy. SOUND of grinding heavy rocks.
speaker_heading: SUE (O.S.)
dialog: Open up Ben, we need to talk.
text: It all stops. A beat, then all four legs of the bed give way
text: and it crashes to the floor. Under the covers, he groans in
text: pain, and his voice is DEEPER, GRAVELY, but definitely CLEAR:
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: LEAVE ME ALONE!!!
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: Reed decides they can't wait any longer. He kneels to the
text: floor. He concentrates, not sure if it will work...
text: Suddenly, his arm STRETCHES, THIN ENOUGH TO CREEP UNDER THE
speaker_heading: DOORJAMB.
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: Reed's arm wriggles under the door. It bends upward, swiping
text: clumsily, until it finally grabs the knob. Rubbery fingers
text: find the latch and unlock the door.
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: Reed focuses, and pulls. His arm snakes out from under the
text: door and snaps back into place. His flesh and bones
text: reforming before their eyes. Johnny stares at Reed.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Ewwwwwwww. That is disgusting.
text: They hear a tremendous SMASH from inside the room.
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: They open the door. The room is trashed. Every stick of
text: furniture smashed to splinters.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: ...Ben?
text: Their eyes adjust; there's a huge hole where the window used
text: to be. They rush to it. Looking out they see SOMETHING
text: LARGE in the distance, running away.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What is that thing?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I think that thing is Ben.
text: Reed looks out, emotions roiling. Is that his best
text: friend...? Suddenly, Victor comes around the corner (bandage
dialog: bigger).
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Victor, are you feeling alright?
text: He considers, but never shows weakness. He nods.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
text: Just a little banged up. A couple
dialog: scrapes. Why?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Ben did this.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Ben did this?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: He's had some kind of...reaction to
dialog: exposure from the cloud. And he's not
dialog: the only one.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We need to find him.
text: Victor redirects his attention to Sue.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Victor, I'm sorry I --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: (cold)
dialog: Just find him.
text: Victor strides off, leaving the others.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Anybody know where the big guy's
dialog: going?
text: We PUSH IN on a picture of Debbie lying on the floor, Reed
dialog: knows exactly where Ben is going.
speaker_heading: REED
text: He's going home.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN YARD - NIGHT
text: A view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance.
text: CAMERA MOVES down to A TRAIN YARD, where we find empty cargo
text: trains. We PUSH IN on the main track, where...
text: A CARGO TRAIN has just stopped. We hear a cargo DOOR slide
text: open, then WHUMP! Big FEET hit the ground. Someone, or
text: someTHING barrels into the night.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT
text: A locked storefront on Flatbush Ave. SOUND of breaking
dialog: glass.
scene_heading: INT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT
text: SERIES OF SHOTS: Ben tries on clothes, shoes. Jackets rip,
text: shoes split. He needs an extra extra extra large.
scene_heading: EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT
text: A HUGE FIGURE is huddled in shadow. It's Ben.
text: CLOSE ON: The dial pad. Big fingers try to push keys but
text: they're too large. Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more
text: and more frustrated. He manages to press "0" with his pinky.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Hello, Operator?
text: Ben looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a
text: modest, working-class home. His eyes go soft when he sees
text: Debbie grab the phone.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Deb... It's me. I need you to step
text: out front.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Out front? You home, baby? I got
dialog: a surprise for you.
text: He blinks hard. Sad, dark.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I got a surprise for you too.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Debbie steps out. There is "WELCOME HOME" sign over the
text: door. She looks out. The wind blows softly. Something
text: shifts in the darkness. Debbie pulls her robe tighter.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Ben?
speaker_heading: BEN (O.S.)
dialog: Don't come any closer for a sec. This
dialog: is gonna be kind of a shock... You
dialog: remember when we said "together
dialog: forever no matter what"?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Baby, you're scaring me.
text: A hanging beat. And Ben...steps into the light, where we SEE
text: HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME: he's HUGE, easily twice the size he
text: once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY.
text: Debbie sees him. Fear washes over her, not sure what to
text: think. He reaches out, a little tentative. She flinches
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh my G-g-g. What did you...do to
dialog: Ben?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Deb, it's me. It's still me.
text: He reaches out. She recoils. It's too much for her. Tears
text: swell in her eyes. Covering her mouth, she backs away.
text: He takes a step closer. She backs away faster, tripping over
text: her robe, falling into the street. A car screeches to a
text: halt. Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME!
text: Her shout wakes NEIGHBORS. Lights flicker on. Ben knows he
text: has to go. He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time
text: he'll see her. She trembles, terrified. His eyes go moist.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I love you, Deb.
text: With that, he turns away. The "WELCOME HOME" sign flutters,
text: falls to the ground. A tragic tableau. As more lights go on
text: around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S COMPOUND OFFICE - DAY
text: Victor packs a monogrammed Armani briefcase: "VDM" emblazoned
text: on a gold plate. Leonard waits not-so-patiently.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Make sure you find Ben, bring him back
dialog: here. And keep it quiet. I don't
dialog: need this to hit the press.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at
dialog: eight, then a nine-thirty interview
dialog: with the Journal --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Front page?
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Top left, like you asked.
dialog: (a smile)
dialog: Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who
dialog: knows...maybe Washington.
text: Victor turns to Leonard, disappointed with him.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Leonard. Think bigger.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY
text: We swoop toward this epic monument. On a steel girder above
text: the road, we see...a STATUE. BEN. He sits on the edge of
text: the beams, staring down at the river below, brooding,
text: muttering.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: A few days in space, it'll be great,
dialog: what's the worst that could happen?
text: A PIGEON flutters past him, and drops a white gooey gift on
text: his shoulder. Ben just glares up at the heavens.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Perfect. Thanks.
text: He hears the sound of someone SOBBING. He turns to see...a
text: distraught BUSINESSMAN with a briefcase. The man drops his
text: case, which PLUMMETS hundreds-of-feet into the RIVER.
text: The Businessman looks out, ready to jump. He doesn't see Ben
text: (or doesn't realize Ben is not a statue).
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You think you got trouble? Take a
dialog: good look, pal, how bad could it be?
text: The Businessman looks at Ben, terrified. Ben steps forward.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, easy there, buddy.
text: Backpedaling, the man SLIPS, FALLING toward the ROADWAY! His
text: arms flail, grabbing a narrow beam -- his fingers hold tight
text: while his legs thrash over speeding traffic. Cars and trucks
text: SKIM right underfoot. Ben shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You had to choose my spot, didn't you?
text: Ben steps out to help, but...his WEIGHT BENDS the beam! The
text: Businessman LOSES HIS GRIP! He FALLS TO THE ROAD, landing
text: hard on the highway! A few PEDESTRIANS see Ben. They point.
text: Ben looks up, deer in headlights. He sees a massive TRUCK
text: bearing down on the Businessman.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: This is really not my day.
text: Ben DROPS to the street. WHOOMPF! He lands in front of the
text: Businessman, SWEEPS him out of the way with one arm, and
text: turns to the oncoming 18 WHEELER CAB.
text: The DRIVER slams his brakes, eyes wide. The truck SWERVES,
text: but cannot stop! Time slows to syrup, as Ben looks a little
text: scared. He shuts his eyes, and...
text: SHOULDER-BLOCKS the INCOMING TRUCK! A football move. The
text: truck BUCKLES, POPPING a WHEELIE, CRUMPLING all the way to
text: the windshield! It looks like a metal car-compactor.
text: The truck SWERVES hard, its tail SMASHING into steel girders.
scene_heading: CARS SCREECH, SWERVE, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, CAUSING A
text: FOUR-LANE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT! Windows shatter, fires flicker.
text: One of the cars in an NYPD CRUISER. COPS clamber out.
scene_heading: EXT. CAB ON HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Reed, Johnny, and Sue sit in the back. They see the action
text: on the bridge. Reed and Sue lock eyes, sensing the worst.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY
text: Ben stands in the middle of the chaos, staring at the
text: destruction. He sees the tow-truck DRIVER bleeding, trapped
text: in his cab. Ben moves to this burning hunk of steel.
text: He SWIPES through the shattered window, and PUNCHES the
text: airbag, POPPING it like a kid's balloon. He tries to grab
text: the seat-belt, but his fingers are TOO BIG. He struggles.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: A little help here?! You wanna hit
dialog: that button, sir?
text: The driver is too woozy. Ben can't get to the button.
text: Frustrated, he simply TEARS OFF THE DOOR, and RIPS THE
text: DRIVER'S SEAT right out of the cab! COPS round the corner.
text: They see Ben holding onto the Driver. They raise their guns.
speaker_heading: COP
text: FREEZE! PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT
speaker_heading: DOWN!
text: Ben looks at the cops. PEDESTRIANS stare, point. He
text: realizes how this must look -- a monster holding a bloody man
dialog: in hand.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - APPROACH - DAY
text: At the back of the traffic jam, cars SCREECH to stops. The
text: whole bridge is FULL of bumper-to-bumper traffic. We PUSH
text: TOWARD one car: three doors pop open, and out come...
text: REED, JOHNNY, SUE. They look through smoke and mayhem to
text: see...their first full look at Ben. Reed stands gutpunched.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Not even Ben deserves that.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY
text: Ben puts the seat down, with the Driver on it. He lunges
text: behind a truck. The cops try to follow, but FLAMES push them
text: back. Ben lurches away, head down, self-conscious.
text: He tries to hide from ONLOOKERS around him and PEDESTRIANS on
text: walkways overhead. He wants to escape, but hears SCREAMING
text: MOTORISTS. He grits his teeth, and moves to help them.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - GRIDLOCK - DAY
text: Reed, Sue, and Johnny race toward the flames. All other
text: people head in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BRIDGE POLICE herd
text: the crowd away from the accident.
speaker_heading: BRIDGE COP
dialog: Back! We're evac-ing the bridge.
text: Reed, Sue, and Johnny slow down, swap glances.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What now? Reed...? What do we do?
text: MOVE IN ON REED. A first test of leadership. But he is not
text: a leader. Not yet. Sue gets closer to him.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ben's out there. Let's go get him.
speaker_heading: BRIDGE COP
dialog: Maybe you didn't hear me. Those cars
dialog: are gonna blow sky high, any second.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Look, we've got a friend out there in
dialog: trouble. We need to get to him before --
speaker_heading: BRIDGE COP #2
text: Nobody gets past this point.
text: A hard beat. Reed signals Sue with a look, a nod.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (mutters)
dialog: We need to get past them.
text: He motions to her body. She understands. She concentrates,
text: and starts to turn invisible.
speaker_heading: BRIDGE COP #1
dialog: What the hell is this? A magic show?
text: But her clothes don't go invisible. Beat. Reed mutters:
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What...?
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: Oh.
text: She unbuttons her blouse. Not thrilled with the idea. She
text: wriggles out of her pants. Down to her skivvies. She
text: reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses
text: concentration and becomes visible. The sight of Sue in her
text: undies grabs the COPS' attention. Everyone watches, stunned.
text: The realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of
text: bricks. Cops are transfixed. So is Reed.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: This is wrong in so many ways.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: You've been working out.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Shut up.
text: Sue takes a deep breath. Closes her eyes. Focuses. Nothing
text: happens. She's embarrassed and furious.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Any more ideas, Reed? Maybe you
dialog: should strip down next, see how it
dialog: feels to have fifty people staring --
text: ...and she DISAPPEARS. Entirely. Undies float. Jaws drop.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Uh, Sue?
text: She stops ranting. Realizes she's gone invisible.
speaker_heading: SUE (INVISIBLE)
dialog: Oh. Well then...
text: The undies drop. The cops stare open-mouthed. They turn to
text: look at Reed, astonished. He sheepishly shrugs his
dialog: shoulders.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I'm gonna need serious therapy.
text: A beat. She walks away. The cops watch her, gaping. By the
text: time they turn back around, Reed and Johnny are gone,
text: disappearing into the clouds of smoke.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY
text: A news CHOPPER flies around the bridge, fighting for the best
text: angle on the action.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - ACCIDENT - DAY
text: Reed races through wreckage. He tries to see over a big
text: TRUCK, and his neck STREEETCHES!
text: He finally sees...BEN. Reed wraps around a car, and...BOO!
text: His face snakes right in front of Ben. Ben jumps.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What the --!
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Ben. Are you okay?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
text: He motions to Reed's neck. Then to his own body:
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Or this?! What the hell am I? 'Cause
dialog: I sure ain't Ben anymore.
text: Reed opens his mouth, but he has no answer. Not yet.
speaker_heading: SUE (O.S.)
text: REED! BEN! LOOK OUT!
text: Ben spins, looking for Sue. He can't see her. But he does
text: see...A CAR INCHES AWAY, WITH GAS TANK FLAMING!
text: BOOOOM! The first car BLOWS! BOOOM!BOOOOM!BOOOOOM! Empty
text: cars BLOW in a chain-reaction. The flames are mushrooming!
text: Reed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back. His arms
text: FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin.
text: FLAMES lash out. A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream.
text: Johnny LEAPS toward them. His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving
text: him extra lift. He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women,
text: SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back. He looks
text: the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile.
text: Sue SCREAMS. She puts her hands up (a normal reflex). The
text: air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS.
text: She looks at them, surprised, confused. Her invisible fields
text: SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast. But the flames
text: hurtle closer. She fights the pressure. Blood trickles from
text: her nose. Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her...
text: Sue is dressed again. Visible. She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE
text: FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD! She collapses, as the blast
text: deflects off the street and into...
text: An oncoming FIRETRUCK! BOOOOM! The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF
text: THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS. Brakes scream. Its tail
text: slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail.
text: THE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE
text: WATER! FIREMEN hang off the back and sides. The truck
text: TEETERS, falling! Ben wastes no time. He GRABS onto the
text: front of the truck, just as it goes off the side!
text: He DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across
text: the concrete, digging grooves into the street.
text: ON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward
text: the bridge. Their truck SWINGS. Bits and pieces tumble down
text: at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet. All deadly now. The
text: HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT!
text: Ben SCREAMS! STRAINING with all his might. Ben SCREAMS!
text: His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back.
text: Another scream. Another step. Another. Another. Epic,
dialog: painful.
text: He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch.
text: His footsteps THUD. With monumental effort, he levels the
text: truck. Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing
dialog: over Ben.
text: Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort. Ben steps
text: back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted. Wary
text: cops close in to cover him with weapons, but...
text: The FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD. The crowd of onlookers
text: joins in as well. Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised,
text: touched by the reaction. But Ben seems uncomfortable.
text: Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats;
text: he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY
text: Ben sees a familiar face in the masses: DEBBIE. Ben steps
text: toward her, but she stops him with a look. She places
text: something on the ground and runs off into the crowd.
text: Ben sees something GLISTENING on the ground. He stoops over
text: to pick up...her ENGAGEMENT RING. His big fingers can't grip
text: it. He tries in vain. Hopeless, pathetic. A beat. And...
text: A hand grabs the ring. It's Reed. Quiet, close.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I swear to you, I will do everything
dialog: in my power until there is not a
dialog: breath left in me: you are going to be
dialog: Ben again.
text: Off the wounded look in Ben's eyes, wanting to believe him...
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Victor sits with remote in hand, staring at his plasma TV.
text: ON THE TV: he sees a crowd of firemen applauding the new
text: Fantastic Four. For the first time they strike a heroic
text: pose. Leonard enters, with a phone in his hand.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Uh, sir...Larry King called, to
dialog: cancel.
dialog: (seeing the TV, a beat)
dialog: Apparently, there's a bigger story.
text: Victor sees Reed put his arms around Sue as he covers her
text: with the jacket. And the penny drops: he's FURIOUS. As it
text: hits him, he feels something odd. He looks down at his
text: hand...at glints of gleaming METAL poking through flesh.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - DAY
text: An impromptu command center -- a series of police tents,
text: surrounded by EMERGENCY VEHICLES, NEWS VANS, FIRETRUCKS.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - TENT - DAY
text: Reed, Sue, Ben and Johnny sit together, getting changed.
text: They get ready to go, but the CHIEF FIREMAN enters, stopping
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: CHIEF FIREMAN
dialog: There's some folks outside, want to
dialog: talk to you.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: We're not going public with this.
dialog: We're scientists, not celebrities.
speaker_heading: CHIEF FIREMAN
dialog: Too late, son.
text: He turns on a little TV MONITOR in the corner. NEWS FOOTAGE
text: plays on all stations, with the tagline: FANTASTIC FOUR.
speaker_heading: CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: That's what they're calling you. The
dialog: Fantastic Four.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Nice.
text: Johnny heads for the exit.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Johnny, slow down. Let's think this
text: through, a second.
text: Johnny pauses. Rubs his chin once. And...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Okay. Done thinking.
text: He runs out. Sue, Ben, and Reed swap glances, knowing Johnny
text: cannot be their spokesman. They take off after him, out to --
scene_heading: EXT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - PRESS FIELD - DAY
text: CLICKCLICKCLICK! Fifty cameras flash. The field is full of
text: press. Our heroes freeze, shocked by the crowd.
text: Johnny eats up the attention. Ben turns, self-conscious.
text: Reed notices. The Chief Fireman turns to them.
speaker_heading: CHIEF FIREMAN
dialog: So which one of you's the leader?
text: Johnny does not hesitate.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: That'd be me.
speaker_heading: CHIEF FIREMAN
dialog: No seriously.
text: A beat. Sue and Ben turn to Reed. The Chief hands him a
dialog: mic.
speaker_heading: CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're on, son. They all want a
dialog: statement.
text: All eyes go on Reed. He looks out, gulps hard. A long beat.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Uh, during our recent mission to the
dialog: Von Doom space station, we were
dialog: exposed to as yet-unidentified
dialog: radioactive energy, most likely some
dialog: kind of nucleotide compoun--
text: Nobody came for a science class. A crush of questions
dialog: overwhelms Reed:
speaker_heading: VARIOUS REPORTERS
dialog: What happened on the bridge? Does it
dialog: hurt to stretch? Were you really on
dialog: fire? Is it true that one of you can
dialog: fly?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Working on it. And it's a lot harder --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We don't know much more than you do,
dialog: at this point. Which is why we will
dialog: be going directly to the lab, where we
dialog: can diagnose our symptoms and --
speaker_heading: REPORTER #2
dialog: Symptoms? So it's like a disease?
text: Reed looks at Ben's face, feeling the guilt. Ben is lost in
text: thought, looking at Deb's ENGAGEMENT RING. Johnny leaps in.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Symptoms? Please. If having powers
dialog: is a disease, then yeah we got it.
dialog: And we are gonna blow your minds.
text: There's a new day dawning. The day of
dialog: the Fantastic Four.
speaker_heading: REPORTER #3
dialog: That thing doesn't look too fantastic.
text: The Reporter nods toward Ben. Ben's fists tighten, the sound
text: of rocks crushing together. Reed feels the pain.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero
dialog: who's been through a terrible orde--
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What he's trying to say is: every team
dialog: needs a mascot...
text: Reporters laugh. Ben turns his head away. Reed burns.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Look, we went up to space to find a
dialog: way to understand DNA, to cure
dialog: disease, save lives. Well, now it's
dialog: our DNA, our disease, our lives on the
dialog: line...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Thank you. No more questions.
text: Reed, Sue, and Ben get up to go. The press waits a beat,
text: then surges. Ben spins, holding up one finger. A giant.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Be nice.
text: The press step back, intimidated. Flashbulbs POP, and Ben's
text: FACE FREEZES. It goes BLACK-AND-WHITE on a NEW YORK POST in --

scene_heading: INT. BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: NED CECIL
dialog: Well, Victor, the bank would like to
dialog: congratulate you. On the fastest
dialog: freefall since the Depression. We
dialog: can't even give your stock away.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Ned, you know I can turn this around.
text: Ned motions to the paper, the picture of BEN.
speaker_heading: NED CECIL
dialog: You promised a cure-all, and came back
dialog: with this. Who the hell's going to
dialog: invest in a biotech company that turns
dialog: its workers into circus freaks?
text: Victor's grip tightens around the table, and...the LAPTOPS
text: FLICKER, losing feeds.
text: Victor looks down at his hands -- a private beat (did I do
text: that?) He lets go of the table; screens go back to normal.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: (pointed)
dialog: I really appreciate all your support.
speaker_heading: NED CECIL
dialog: You've got a week, Victor. One week
dialog: to turn this around. Or we pull

text: Leonard is thinking all business.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Sir. Reed's comments at that press
dialog: conference killed us. How are we
dialog: going to turn this around?
text: Victor considers. His mind races, eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Very simple. I cure them. If I can

scene_heading: EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY
text: REPORTERS snap pictures. A POLICE CONVOY drives up, stopping

dialog: position.
text: COPS hold back the surging press. Ben keeps his head down,

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Smile, Ben. They want to like you.
dialog: Give 'em your good side. Or your less
dialog: bad side.
text: Ben turns to a group of LITTLE KIDS. Stiff, tentative:
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Uh...don't do drugs.
text: The kids FLINCH. Ben trudges on. Johnny smiles bright,

scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

speaker_heading: O'HOOLIHAN
dialog: Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr.
dialog: Richards. All that for you?
text: He motions to the flashing cameras outside.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I'm afraid so...

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Jimmy. Good to see you again.
text: He smiles at Sue, then at Reed.
speaker_heading: O'HOOLIHAN
dialog: Good to see you too... Don't worry,
dialog: sir. I know how crowded that head of
dialog: yours is.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Any visitors while I was away?
speaker_heading: O'HOOLIHAN
dialog: Just the usual. Told 'em you were
text: circling round outer space.
text: He opens a drawer full of LETTERS from the BANK. Reed looks
text: sheepish. He shuts the drawer, looks to Johnny and Sue.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: We had a tough year.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah, nine years straight.
text: Reed looks at Ben. Thanks a lot. DING. Elevator doors
dialog: open.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY
text: They enter. Reed hits the top button, for the 20TH FLOOR.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Twenty? From outside the place looks
dialog: a lot taller.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Oh, it is.
text: The doors close, but...the ELEVATOR does not move. A beat.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Either we're moving really fast...or
dialog: not at all.
text: A digital readout on the panel: EXCEED MAXIMUM WEIGHT. A
text: sign reads: MAXIMUM CAPACITY: 2000 pounds. They turn to Ben.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'll take the stairs.
text: Doors open. He lumbers out. As the doors close behind him,
text: he looks back over his shoulder, locking eyes with Reed.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY
text: The elevator rises. Reed roils with guilt.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: How come Ben can't turn it on and off
dialog: like us?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: That's what we're here to find out.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: If it happened to him, then it
dialog: could...
text: Happen to all of them. Reed nods softly.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Wait. You mean there's chance we
dialog: could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Grow up, Johnny. You want to run
dialog: around on fire for the rest of your
dialog: life?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Is that a trick question? C'mon, I
dialog: can't be the only one who thinks
dialog: this is cool.
text: Reed considers. But Sue cuts him short with a look.
text: DING! The elevator stops.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ATRIUM - MOMENTS LATER
text: The elevator opens. They step out. They might be on the
dialog: 20th floor, but Reed owns the building from here to floor
text: sixty. It's a massive atrium, lit by skylights far above --
text: Reed leads them into another area filled with separate
dialog: "apartments" and all the amenities of home.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: We should stay here until we can
dialog: define the extent of our changes...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: This place is deluxe. You got cable?
speaker_heading: REED
text: (hearing Ben's FOOTSTEPS)
dialog: ...and figure out how to reverse them.
dialog: Let me show you to your rooms.
scene_heading: EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY
text: The press has died down, but there are still plenty of
text: cameras. A MAYBACH SEDAN rolls up. Victor emerges, wearing
text: sunglasses. This time, the press pay no attention to him.
text: No cameras flash. Victor tightens, and enters the building.
scene_heading: INT. SUE'S ROOM - DAY
text: Sue walks out of the bathroom in a robe, drying her hair.
text: She notices a familiar book on a shelf: a SCRAPBOOK.
text: She flips through it. It's filled with pictures of Reed and
dialog: his inventions -- a lot less fancy than Victor's multimedia
text: globe. She stops at a picture of her and Reed in COLLEGE.
text: A noise, and she turns, flinching slightly, surprised to
text: see...VICTOR. He smiles, standing at the door, watching her.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: God, I've been so worried about you.
text: She notices the scar on his head.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Victor, your scar --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm
dialog: worried about.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Please, no apologies. I've arranged
dialog: for your things to be moved to one of
dialog: my condos. You'll have round-the
dialog: clock care.
text: He goes for her bag. But she stops him. A half beat.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Thank you, that's generous, but I
dialog: think I should stay here. With my
dialog: brother. Until we get a handle on
dialog: this.
text: Victor is not used to being rebuffed. He gives a thin smile.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sue. I think you should let my
dialog: doctors have a look at you.
text: A tense beat. Standoff. Made more tense by --
speaker_heading: REED (O.S.)
dialog: Victor! What are you doing here?
text: They turn to see Reed approaching, with files in hand.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I'm starting to wonder the same
dialog: thing... How much do you know about
dialog: what happened to you?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Not much. We need to run tests to see
dialog: the extent of the damage.
text: Victor pauses. He looks at Sue, knowing she's here to stay.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Well, let me know if there is anything
dialog: I can do. We're all in this together
dialog: now.
text: Victor shakes Reed's hand. His GRIP is so tight that Reed's
text: fingers STRETCH. Victor lets go, and turns to Sue, who puts
text: her hand out. He smiles, and shakes. He heads off.
text: Reed looks at his hand. Shakes his wrist. He looks at
dialog: Victor.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALL - DAY
text: Victor moves fast, holds tight to his anger. Reed catches
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Victor wait... I just wanted to say,
dialog: I'm sorry the mission didn't go as
dialog: planned --
text: Victor suddenly WHEELS on Reed. Lights flicker.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Didn't go as planned? It was a
dialog: catastrophe. You ruined the lives of
dialog: four people --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I ruined? With all due respect, I
dialog: told you to abort --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Abort? Reed, I put my company, my
dialog: name, billions of dollars on the line,
dialog: and I will not let you make me look
dialog: like a fool --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Victor, if we could understand what
dialog: happened to us --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I don't want to understand it. This
dialog: isn't one of your science projects. I
dialog: just want to fix it. Fast!
text: Reed sees Victor's SCAR maybe growing. Lights dim.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: There a problem, Vic?
text: They turn to see...BEN down the hall, leaning in a doorway.
text: Victor tightens, looking at Ben's massive rock-hewn body.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: No problem, Ben.
text: He turns back to Reed. Close, quiet. Lights flicker.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Just pay your goddamn electric bill,
dialog: and get to work on a cure.
text: Victor steps away, toward the elevator. He passes Ben, who
text: just smiles and waves "goodbye." Before Victor's finger taps
text: the down-button, the button lights up (as if the circuit
text: responded to him). Reed exhales, shaken. Victor steps into --
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY
text: The doors close, and Victor really LETS LOOSE. He SLAMS his
text: fist into a STEEL WALL. The wall BUCKLES, steel DENTING.
text: Victor shakes out his hand, and sees...a rippling METALLIC
text: SHELL under the skin. He stares at it in horror. The dark
text: surface pulsates with electric energy. What is he
dialog: becoming...?
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY
text: Sue works the controls. Reed approaches Ben with an
text: ELECTRODE NEEDLE. He tries to stick the needle into Ben, but
text: it SNAPS.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You got a chisel round here?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: If we're going to identify the source
dialog: of the mutation, we need to isolate
dialog: your recombinant DNA so we can
dialog: activate positional genomes.
text: Ben looks to Sue for translation.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We need to give you a physical, so we
dialog: know what got zapped.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Well why didn't you say so? You want
dialog: me to lift some weights or something?
text: Reed shakes his head. He approaches with an X-RAY MACHINE.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: No, just sit back. We have a good
dialog: sense of your strength from the
dialog: firetruck. We need to find the source
dialog: of your strength.
text: He turns on the X-ray machine. The graph shows SOLID ROCK.
text: The rays don't penetrate. Sue and Reed look confused.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: How bad is it? You know I used to
dialog: smoke.
text: Reed grabs a BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE, but the strap is way too
text: short to wrap around Ben's arm. Reed stands stumped. He
text: looks at his tray full of instruments. He picks up the
text: little rubber REFLEX-HAMMER. But it looks miniscule compared
dialog: to Ben.
text: Reed has an idea. He opens a drawer full of HARDWARE TOOLS.
text: He pulls of a real HAMMER. He approaches Ben.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Okay, this might smart a little.
text: He taps Ben's knee lightly, and BEN'S LEG KICKS! SLAMMING
text: UP! RIGHT BETWEEN REED'S LEGS! The ultimate kick in the
text: crotch. Reed STRETCHES UP a few feet, then SNAPS BACK,
text: wincing.
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: (high-pitched voice)
dialog: We'll...continue this later.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY
text: From their second level control room, Reed and Sue observe
text: Johnny in an enclosed fire-proof chamber. Flames escape
text: through the vents of the chamber...he's fully torched!
text: Reed watches the read-out: it climbs from 2000 to 4000
text: degrees Kelvin. They are essentially taking his temperature.
text: INSIDE THE CHAMBER: Johnny turns white hot, blinding to look
text: at: the chamber walls begin to glow red. Machines go
dialog: haywire.
text: His feet even start to LIFT OFF THE GROUND, LEVITATING a foot
text: or two. He looks down, excited, burning hotter and hotter.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Back it down, Johnny!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I can go hotter!
text: He won't stop. Reed pulls a switch on the wall. FOAM sprays
text: out of nozzles, dousing Johnny's flames. He stands there,
text: covered in thick FOAM. His body steams. So does his temper.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're really cramping my style here.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter,
dialog: you're approaching supernova --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Sweet.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: That's the temperature of the sun.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Not only could you kill yourself, but
dialog: you could set fire to Earth's
dialog: atmosphere and destroy all human life
dialog: as we know it.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
text: Reed looks at the control panels.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: He cooked the equipment.
text: Frustrated, Reed looks at the smoking system. And we CUT TO --
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LAB - DAY
text: Reed and Ben sit in chairs, facing each other. A beat
text: passes. Ben taps his fingers on the chair, making small
text: DENTS. Reed looks down at his clipboard. A little awkward.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Okay. I've uh, got some questions,
dialog: from Sue. That she thought might be
dialog: better coming from me... Can you, you
dialog: know, go to the bathroom...like
dialog: normal...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You don't wanna know the details.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Not unless you want that clipboard
dialog: stretched up your --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: O-kay. We'll skip that question.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LAB - DAY
text: Reed and Johnny now. Johnny exercises. Reed stands nearby.
text: Clipboard in hand.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Is there something about flames?
dialog: About flaming, that you --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What are you trying to say? Just
dialog: because I dress well and like to dance --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What? No. I'm trying to figure out
dialog: why we each ended up with different
dialog: symptoms.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot.
dialog: You're...well, you're a little limp.
dialog: Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's
dialog: always been a hardass.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Why aren't you writing this down?
text: Reed sighs. It's going to be a long process.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING LAB - DAY
text: Reed and Sue, tables turned: Reed observes her through a
text: prismatic device measuring light refraction. He "sees" her
text: through the device: lit up like some heavenly creature. He's
text: having a hard time concentrating. He focuses on his work.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: It's not "invisibility" per se.
dialog: You're bending the light around you
dialog: with some kind of malleable force
dialog: field. That's what you projected on
dialog: the Bridge.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What about you? You haven't eaten in
dialog: days. How come you're never on this
dialog: side of the microscope?
text: He tightens, uncomfortable with being center of attention.
text: She reaches for his arm, like a specimen. He pulls away, but
text: she sees a glimpse of BRUISES on his ARMS. She slows down.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bruises...from the bridge?
text: He nods, rolls down his sleeves.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Have you had any side-effects, from
dialog: your powers?
text: She considers. A little vulnerable.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I've had some headaches. Migraines.
text: A beat. Reed drops his eyes, makes a note, back to work.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: You should be able to bend light
dialog: around other objects, even people, if
dialog: you could control your emotional state
dialog: better --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Excuse me?
text: She is annoyed. Reed is oblivious.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I'm saying, if you had a little more
dialog: self control, you could locate the
dialog: trigger. Can you remember the exact
dialog: emotions when --
speaker_heading: SUE
text: Anger. Rage. Frustration.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Okay. Is there any way to duplicate
dialog: that feeling? Some memory or...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (staring right at him)
dialog: I'm sure I can come up with something.
text: She looks at Reed, eyes narrow. She becomes invisible. As
text: she focuses on Reed -- and gets angry -- a small, clear FORCE
text: FIELD forms around her body. The force-field BENDS LIGHT
text: around a MICROSCOPE, which goes INVISIBLE. Reed steps out to
dialog: ask...
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: How's that coming -- whoa --
text: The FORCE-FIELD shoots in all directions, knocking everything
text: over in a fifteen foot radius. Reed is thrown from his
dialog: chair.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
dialog: do that... You must think that was
dialog: some kind of latent hostility or --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: What in the world would give me that
dialog: idea?
text: An awkward beat.
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, you broke up with me, right?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Are you kidding?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: No, I distinctly remember: you walked
dialog: out my door. Ergo...
text: She didn't want to get into this. She looks down,
dialog: vulnerable.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Reed. I was ready for the next step,
dialog: you weren't, ergo, I walked.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I think it was a little more
dialog: complicated than --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I just wanted to share an apartment.
dialog: What was so complicated about that?
text: The question stumps him. A beat. He struggles.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: There were a lot of variables to
dialog: consider --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No. There weren't. There was you.
dialog: And me. No variables, no math. It
dialog: was actually the simplest thing in the
dialog: world. But your head got in the way...
dialog: like it always does.
text: Her words penetrate. He knows she's right. He looks away.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Sue...I just...I thought...
text: He struggles for the words.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Same old Reed. Too much thinking...
text: He opens his mouth, but...WHAM! Doors open. Johnny enters,
text: wearing a CHARRED SHIRT. He points to the burned scraps of
text: his shirt.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Okay guys, we have a serious problem.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY
text: ANGLES of Reed in the lab, grabbing their space uniforms from
dialog: various closets/containers:
speaker_heading: REED (V.O.)
dialog: Our uniforms were exposed to the storm
dialog: like us. So they can transform like
text: us, becoming invisible, changing size
dialog: on demand or remaining impervious to
dialog: flame.
text: REVEAL: Reed, Sue, and Johnny step out to look at themselves
text: in a mirror wearing the uniforms. No boots, no gloves. Not
dialog: yet. (The uniforms will develop, like our heroes).
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You look like an eighties rock band.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (to Ben)
dialog: The suit will stretch. You should try
dialog: it --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: He's right. These costumes are...
dialog: missing something. I can't put my
dialog: finger on it --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: They're not costumes.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We're not taking them out. Johnny, we
dialog: need to stay here till we've stabilized.
dialog: 
text: Johnny shakes his head, frustrated.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I'm getting sick of being trapped
dialog: here. NASA wasn't even this strict!
text: He marches out. Sue turns to Reed, who says nothing. Sue
text: heads out, leaving Ben and Reed. A beat. Ben looks at Reed.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (looking at uniform)
text: Maybe it's missing a utility belt.
text: Off Reed's dark look, we hear:
speaker_heading: VICTOR (V.O.)
dialog: So what's the prognosis?
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON: an X-RAY. Victor's ARM. The metallic
text: transformation is higher now. PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Victor
text: and his DOCTOR. In the wall behind them: ancient armor
dialog: (maybe we noticed it before, maybe not). It adds a little
text: menace to the room.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Your tissue, your organs, your entire
text: biophysical structure is changing.
dialog: Every system is still functioning,
dialog: somehow --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: And they're changing into...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I don't really know. A compound
dialog: organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than
dialog: titanium or carbon steel. Harder than
dialog: diamonds --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Like the shields Reed said would
dialog: protect us.
dialog: (cold fury, deadly focus)
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: At this rate, the infection should be
dialog: complete in two, maybe three weeks --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What do you mean "complete"?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I wish I could tell you. I can't
dialog: pretend to know what we're dealing
dialog: with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
text: Victor hardens, razor sharp.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: The Center for Disease Control. If
dialog: this thing is contagious --
text: WHHM! Victor GRABS the Doctor by the throat.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Look at me. I have a life. I'm the
dialog: face of a billion-dollar-company... We
dialog: need to keep this confidential,
dialog: understand?
text: Victor's grip TIGHTENS around the man's throat.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: But...this disease...is progressive...
dialog: degenerative...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: That's terrible news...
text: With one cobra-swift move, Victor thrusts his metallic arm
text: into the doctor, killing him instantly. Victor retracts his
text: arm, and looks at it, shocked by his own strength.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: ...but I think I'll get a second
dialog: opinion.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: A SERIES OF TIME-LAPSE SHOTS: REED works around the Baxter
text: Building, spending hours searching for the cure. He checks
text: charts, writes equations, paces, frustrated.
text: Finally, he sits at his long desk, looking at a wall where
text: Ben's CHARTS are projected (both Ben and Thing's anatomies).
text: Reed wears the uniform under his labcoat. He checks his
text: equations over and over, making notes upon notes.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Nothing...nothing...nothing...
text: He hits the end of the slides. The wall fills with white
text: light. Frustrated, Reed SLAMS his head into his desk, CRASH!
text: Something FALLS off the end of the desk.
text: Reed raises his head, revealing his flattened face. He steps
text: over to see...a PLANT SAMPLE from space, glass box shattered.
text: Red sparks swirl around the plant, like the cosmic storm --
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course...of course...the cloud...
text: THE COSMIC STORM swirls, terrifying. We slowly PULL BACK TO --
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MAIN LAB - NIGHT
text: The STORM is a computer-image on screen now. Behind the
text: screen are six chalkboards full of Reed's calculations and
text: the scribbled beginnings of a MACHINE.
text: We PULL BACK to see his arm stretched across the room writing
text: on the end of another chalkboard.
text: He's moving fast, excited, almost a little manic. He
text: hears...a CREAK. He slows down, but doesn't look up to see
text: SUE enter.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (fast, charged)
dialog: The plants, from space. Their
text: particles are still charged. With the
dialog: right amount of energy, those ions
dialog: could create the elemental profile of
dialog: the cosmic storm.
text: He rifles through a desk drawer, then heads out. Sue stands
text: there, looking at the storm. Concerned. Then we CUT TO --
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Sue follows Reed. He flips through a file, excited.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: If we can build a machine to re-create
dialog: the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: And reverse the mutations --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (talking more to himself)
dialog: Curing countless diseases, not just
dialog: ours.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: But we're the focus, right Reed?
dialog: Reed...?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Of course. Of course.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: And you sure you can control this
dialog: thing? Last time didn't work out so
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (preoccupied, mind
dialog: spinning)
dialog: With the right energy, we can
dialog: stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into
dialog: the city grid...
text: He keeps his head down, making notes, entering --
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - STOREROOM - NIGHT
text: Reed and Sue enter. Reed is looking for something. Sue
text: slows down, staring at this sprawling space, jam-packed with
scene_heading: GEAR, GADGETS, BLUEPRINTS, INVENTIONS. Awe-inspiring,
text: overflowing.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You really need to get a janitor.
text: She stares at shelves upon shelves of overcrowded clutter.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: This must be what it looks like inside
dialog: your head.
text: Reed finds his electron microscope. He turns to Sue,
dialog: defensive:
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: There's a system to it.
text: She starts to pull out a MODEL of the FANTASTICAR.
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait! Sue, don't touch tha--
text: The little car sets the whole shelf off balance. A WAVE OF
text: INVENTIONS COME CLATTERING DOWN! Reed moves fast:
text: He LUNGES toward Sue, STREETCHING his ARMS AROUND the SHELF,
text: pushing Sue away, just as the INVENTIONS SMASH TO THE GROUND!
text: Reed and Sue hit the floor. A close call. Now more
text: closeness: Sue and Reed lay face-to-face, with Reed's wrapped
text: around her. A heated beat. Their first real intimate
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Sorry. My fault. I won't...touch
dialog: anything.
text: As if suddenly made aware of their vulnerability, Sue and
text: Reed stand, backing off. As they part, we see:
text: BEN watching from the doorway. Melancholy. He disappears.
text: We slowly MOVE TO...A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in a VENT GRATE.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Victor watches a bank of videoscreens. He has the Baxter
text: Building under surveillance. He sees Reed and Sue on
text: monitors. He toys with Sue's diamond ring in his gloved
dialog: hand.
text: A door opens. Leonard enters. He sees the screens.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Is Reed any closer to a cure?
text: Victor looks at that image of Reed and Sue on the screen.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
text: The only thing he's closer to is
dialog: Sue...
text: But Victor sees something between Reed and Sue on the wall.
text: He leans closer, and the camera ZOOMS IN, as if responding to
text: his will. He ZOOMS all the way to a CLOSE UP of:
text: REED'S BLUEPRINTS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER. Victor's
text: eyes narrow, mind ticking, a plan forming.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Make me a reservation for two at
dialog: Cipriani tonight.
text: Victor opens a drawer, pulls out an old VIDEOTAPE.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: And get this over to Ben Grimm.
text: Victor leans forward, fixated on that machine. As he gets
text: closer, his screens go STATICKY. He absentmindedly picks at
text: his SCAR. In shadows, we see skin peeling off.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Close your eyes, baby. Keep 'em
dialog: closed.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - NIGHT
text: BEN GRIMM stands front and center. Not the Thing. But BEN
text: GRIMM. A normal man. He smiles wide, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: You surprised?
text: Now we PULL BACK to reveal DEBBIE and BEN on a SCREEN. The
text: Thing watches the old videotape. He smiles sadly at his old
text: life. He mouths the words -- he knows this tape by heart.
speaker_heading: BEN (ON SCREEN)
dialog: Yeah I'm surprised. Surprised the
dialog: fire department didn't shut this down.
text: ON SCREEN: the handheld camera whips around, revealing...a
text: SURPRISE PARTY. Full of people. Ben Grimm is a popular guy.
text: On screen: Reed hugs Ben. They pose for pictures together.
speaker_heading: THE THING
dialog: God. I was good looking.
text: We hear the party sing "HAPPY BIRTHDAY." Debbie kisses Ben.
text: Thing's eyes start to mist. On screen: Ben blows out
dialog: candles.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (ON SCREEN)
dialog: What did you wish for, honey?
speaker_heading: BEN (ON SCREEN)
dialog: I already got it. Everything I want.
text: As they kiss, a tear runs down Thing's cheek. The tape ends,

text: Ben stalks the halls, slipping into his ragged trenchcoat.
text: As he passes a crossroads, he sees a strange sight:
text: REED'S HAND is TIED to a latch in the wall. His ARM is
text: STREEETCHED THIN, spanning around the corner. Ben just
text: shakes his head, keeps moving. And we FOLLOW REED'S ARM...
text: UP THE HALL...ROUND A CORNER...DOWN ANOTHER HALL. The
text: muscles and tissue STRETCH, going taut. Finally, we reach...
text: REED. He steps slowly. He holds a digital TAPE-MEASURE in
text: his other hand, measuring distance. His skin STREEETCHES.
text: His face tightens, pained. We hear the faint SQUEAK of his
dialog: skin.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Damn, Stretch!
text: Reed turns his head around, seeing JOHNNY come down the hall.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: How far's that rubber bend?
text: Reed keeps moving, slowly. His muscles and tendons laboring.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: That's what I'm trying to calculate.
dialog: And it's not rubber. It's muscle,
dialog: tendon. I seem to have the ability to
dialog: manipulate the malleability of my
dialog: molecular structure and redistribute
dialog: my density to --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Right, whatever, have fun.
text: And Johnny is GONE, ducking under Reed's arm into --
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Johnny opens a cupboard, pulls out some JIFFY POP. It starts
text: to POP in his hand, the bag swelling. He casually turns on a
text: TV, flipping to...the X- GAMES. The Jiffy Pop swells, ready
text: to blow. He rips it open, eats popcorn, and watches the
dialog: games:
text: Cool stunts, hot girls. Johnny's brow furrows, a thought
text: forming, a mischievous smile on his lips.
scene_heading: EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - SIDE EXIT - NIGHT
text: A FIGURE exits, wearing that ragged trenchcoat and fedora.
text: Ben disappears into the dark night, and we CUT TO --
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT
text: Dark. Lights flicker. Steam rises through the grates. A
text: shadow emerges. Ben. He heads toward O'DONNEL'S PUB, a
text: classic Brooklyn tavern. Neon sign. Music, life inside.
text: Ben pulls his hat low, turns up his collar, and squeezes
dialog: through the door into --
scene_heading: INT. O'DONNEL'S PUB - NIGHT
text: A big photo of Ben Grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a
text: place over the bar. Ben enters, and the bar goes SILENT. He
text: moves through the crowd. People clear out of the way.
text: Ben reaches the bar. He sits on a stool, and CRUNCH! SMASH!
text: The stool SNAPS like a toothpick. He hits the ground hard.
text: Glasses shake. A few PATRONS smile, laugh softly.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's not funny!
text: They go silent. They drop bills onto tables, filing out,
text: scared of this monster. ERNIE works the bar.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first
dialog: mook from Brooklyn to go to outer
dialog: space, so pay him some respect!
text: But the patrons keep filing out. Ben looks down, weary.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Ernie. Sorry for killing your
dialog: business. I'll take the usual, then
dialog: I'm out... Better make it a double.
text: Ernie heads for the booze. Ben gives a sad shake of his
text: head. Then he notices...one lone patron at the end of the
text: bar. A beautiful young woman nursing a drink. Meet ALICIA
speaker_heading: MASTERS.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Who killed the party?
text: She turns to him, unafraid. He notices her blank stare, lack
text: of focus, and white cane. Alicia is blind.
speaker_heading: ERNIE (O.S.)
dialog: Make it a triple. On the house,
dialog: Benny.
text: Ben takes his drink, but SMASH! His grip shatters the glass,
text: spilling all over himself. He smiles ruefully.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: If there's a God, she hates me.
text: He grabs a bar-rag to dry off.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: I don't think She's real big on hate.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You wouldn't say that, if you could
dialog: see me.
text: She knocks back her drink, grabs her cane, steps toward Ben.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Can I...? See you...?
text: Ben doesn't say anything. A little unnerved by this woman.
speaker_heading: ALICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay, I won't bite...
dialog: (feeling his arm)
dialog: ...not that I could.
text: She puts a hand on his face -- something in her tone and
text: gentle touch allows Ben to let her. She smiles softly.
speaker_heading: ALICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Such a sad face... You know, sometimes
dialog: being different isn't a bad thing.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Trust me, this ain't one of those
dialog: times.
text: She smiles softly, takes her cane, and starts to head out.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: See you round, Benny...
text: Right as she hits the door, over her shoulder --
speaker_heading: ALICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm Alicia, by the way.
text: Ben watches her disappear. He sees a few people staring. He
text: lowers his head, turns back to the bar, and finds a new
text: drink, in a steel MARTINI SHAKER. He knocks it back.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Lights twinkle. A MAITRE D' leads us through fancy digs.
text: Heads turn, whispers flutter. SUE steps out, joining...
text: Victor at a prime table. He pulls out her chair, wearing
dialog: gloves.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Thank you for coming out to see me.
text: She nods, a little self-conscious.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You said it was urgent.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It is. There's something we need to
dialog: talk about. Something I need to ask
dialog: you...
text: Sue senses where this is going, and she cuts it short.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (slow, careful)
dialog: Victor, wait, slow down a second. I
dialog: want you to know I appreciate
dialog: everything you've done for me, but I
dialog: just don't --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Susan. What are you doing?
text: He is cold as ice. If he's hurt, he'll never show it.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: You think I brought you here to talk
dialog: about us? Please. This is business.
dialog: (leaning forward, intense)
dialog: I need to know: how close is Reed
dialog: to finding to a cure?
text: She pauses. Then:
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: He's working round the clock. But the
dialog: data needs to be tested, analyzed
dialog: before --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Same old Reed. All analysis, no
dialog: action. Wasn't that the problem with
dialog: you two?
text: She holds tight, keeping cool.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: If these molecules aren't stable, they
dialog: could make us worse, maybe even kill
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Then why is Reed dragging his feet?
dialog: Maybe he likes having his prize
dialog: specimen under glass...
dialog: (closer, cruel)
dialog: It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally
dialog: the perfect woman for him...because
dialog: you're his science project.
text: The words sting. She can't help but hear some truth in them.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Please don't make this personal --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Oh, I think you already have.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Victor, we can't do anything until the
dialog: research is ready.
text: Victor's fist CLENCHES -- metal SFX.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: "We," huh?
text: Victor SCREECHES his chair back, PUSHING the table so hard
text: that he SPILLS water. Heads turn, all eyes on Sue. Victor
text: gets close to her, too close, a hand on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't forget who you work for, Susan.
dialog: So get to work. And do your job.
text: He walks out. As he goes, he slips the engagement ring out
text: of his pocket. He crushes the diamond to dust, leaves the
text: dust in an ashtray, and disappears into the night.
text: Sue sits embarrassed. She slowly...disappears. People gasp.
text: She walks out, invisible, save for her clothes, which DRIFT
text: through the air. At a TABLE FULL OF BUSINESSMEN --
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: I wish my wife would disappear.
text: The other men laugh, but WHHM! The man's wine SPILLS into
text: his LAP! Sue walks out. The restaurant is left buzzing.
text: Lights twinkle. And we FADE OUT. A beat. Then we CRASH
dialog: INTO --
scene_heading: EXT. NYC ARENA - ESPN MOTO X GAMES - DAY
text: The X games in full effect: A maze of mountainous dirt hills

dialog: And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have
dialog: a special guest for you... Johnny
dialog: Storm of the Fantastic Four!
text: JOHNNY emerges, wearing his blue uniform, waving to the
text: crowd. He steps up to the pit where RIDERS prep. He
text: beelines to RONNIE RENNER.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Hey, Ronnie Renner! I'm a big fan.
text: Ronnie gives a tight nod. He doesn't like being upstaged by
dialog: this circus freak.
text: The other bikers approach.
speaker_heading: KENNY BARTRAM
dialog: Heard you like to ride. Wanna take
dialog: her for a spin?
text: He motions to his BIKE. Johnny eyes this mean machine.
speaker_heading: RONNIE RENNER
dialog: Come on, bro. I'll teach you some
dialog: tricks...if you can keep up.
text: We PUSH IN on Johnny, his ego getting stoked, as we CUT TO --
scene_heading: INT. NYC ARENA - TRACK - DAY
text: Ronnie jams down the track, kicking dirt back at Johnny.
text: Johnny now wears a MOTOCROSS OUTFIT over his uniform, with
text: the number "004" on the back and a small 4 over his heart.
text: Ronnie hits the first hill, and CATCHES AIR, FLIPPING HIGH!
speaker_heading: X GAMES ANNOUNCER
dialog: A rock-solid double-flip!
text: The CROWD goes wild. Now it's Johnny's turn. He hits the
text: hill and pulls the exact same move. With even more height!
speaker_heading: X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at that lift, ladies and
dialog: gentlemen!
text: Johnny sticks the landing. The crowd swells. Ronnie
text: tightens, pulls his throttle harder, taking the next jump,
text: and...MAKING AN INSANE MOVE, CORKSCREWING IN THE AIR!
speaker_heading: X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
text: Frontside 360! He's totally flat and
dialog: whipped!
text: He lands clean. The crowd is ready to explode. Johnny REVS
text: his engine, his body starting to STEAM, adrenaline burning.
text: He hits the hill, and pulls an even gnarlier SPIN!
speaker_heading: X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa! That's a...what is that? A
dialog: 720?
text: Johnny lands. The crowd roars. Ronnie bears down on the
text: last hill. He leans over his handlebars.
speaker_heading: X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
dialog: He's going for a Kiss of Death!
text: Ronnie hits the hill, pulls this JAW-DROPPING DEATH-DEFYING
text: STUNT! The crowd is deafening! Ronnie smiles. And...
dialog: 
text: JOHNNY SPEEDS FASTER, FASTER. Trails of FLAME start to
text: streak off his back! He RACES LIKE A ROCKET UP THE HILL!
text: LAUNCHING TO IMPOSSIBLE HEIGHTS! SPINNING LIKE A TOP! A
speaker_heading: FLAMING BLUR!
text: And now for the really impressive part: Johnny's bike starts
text: to drop, but JOHNNY KEEPS RISING! He FLAMES ON, spiraling
text: upward! For a few seconds, he's actually...almost...flying.
speaker_heading: X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
dialog: (hand over mic)
dialog: Is he......flying?
text: A beat. Time suspended. And...WHHM! He PLUMMETS back down!
text: LANDS on his bike in mid-air! And sticks a perfect landing,
text: maybe even kicking a little dirt up at Ronnie. Johnny
text: swerves to a stop, with a "holy shit" look on his face. What
dialog: the hell just happened??
speaker_heading: X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
dialog: Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen!
dialog: You've just seen the first...the
text: first...TORCHFLIGHT! The McTORCH!
text: A new name is born. The crowd goes berserk. Standing
text: ovation. Riders rush up to Johnny. Kenny sees his bike:
text: THE SEAT MELTED, WHEELS BURNED OFF. Johnny smiles.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: My bad. Sorry about that.
dialog: (a glance to Ronnie)
dialog: Thanks for the lesson, bro.
text: HOT GIRLS swarm. As Johnny gets swallowed by fans, we see a
text: scary thing flicker in his eyes: the birth of a star.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Sue stands alone, sifting through piles of mail. She focuses
text: on one piece of mail that she's holding. Her hand begins to
text: disappear and then the envelope slowly begins to disappear as
text: well. Sue smiles at the success. Intrigued. Quiet:
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: That's new...
text: Reed enters -- overworked, unshaved. He keeps his head down,
text: preoccupied. Sue shifts focus.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you read these...? From all
dialog: over. People want us to fight crimes...
dialog: save their kids...solve their problems...
dialog: (no response from Reed)
dialog: ...when we can't even solve our
dialog: own.
text: She puts the letters down, steps closer to Reed.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Reed. How close are we to a cure?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: No way to know. Without more
dialog: tests, experiments.
text: She considers. Victor's words echo in her head.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We're not specimens, we're patients.
dialog: This isn't just another science
dialog: project to you, is it...?
text: Reed looks up, a little surprised. He opens his mouth, but --
speaker_heading: BEN (O.S.)
dialog: NO...NO...NO FREAKIN' WAY!!
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - DAY
text: CRASH! BANG! Ben stalks around the room, furious. Reed and
text: Sue rush in.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: BEN! What? What's going on!?
text: Ben points to the wall-sized TV: the ESPN MOTO X GAMES.
speaker_heading: X GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
dialog: So what can you tell us about the
dialog: outfit?
text: REVEAL: JOHNNY standing next to an X GAMES REPORTER. He is
text: peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit,
text: revealing his FF UNIFORM, with a "4" STITCHED ONTO THE CHEST.
text: Behind them, STEP UP RIDERS launch their MOTO-BIKES off huge
text: 18' high mountains of dirt, thirty feet in the air.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (ON TV)
dialog: Not too much, but I will say that it's
dialog: all weather and no leather. Kind of
text: Armani meets Astronaut.
text: Ben, Sue, and Reed stare at the wall-sized TV. Mouths agape.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: He didn't.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh, he did.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What did he do to the uniform?!
text: She turns to Reed, who gives a sheepish shrug, and peels back
text: his labcoat revealing a "4" stitched onto his chest too.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: He talked me into it.
speaker_heading: X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
dialog: So what are your superhero names?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (ON TV)
dialog: I go by the Human Torch. The ladies
dialog: call me Torch.
speaker_heading: X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
dialog: What about the rest of the team?
dialog: Johnny hadn't really thought about them. He spitballs:
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (ON TV)
dialog: Uh, we call my sister the invisible
dialog: girl...the Invisible Girl.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Girl...?!
speaker_heading: X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
dialog: That's easy to remember. And Reed
dialog: Richards? He's the leader. So
dialog: what's he? Mr. Fantastic?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well, I wouldn't say he's the leader.
text: Reed shrugs. He doesn't hate the name.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Could be worse.
text: Case in point: a photo of Ben fills the TV.
speaker_heading: X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
dialog: What about this one? What do you call
dialog: this Thing?
text: Johnny smiles, looking right into camera.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: That's it. Just The Thing. We would
dialog: have gone with The Rock, but it was
dialog: taken. And "Thing" pretty much sums
dialog: it up.
text: A LAUGH from the studio audience.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (matter-of-fact)
dialog: Okay. I'm gonna go kill him now.
text: He turns to go. Reed wraps an arm around Ben.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Ben! Slow down a second and --
text: He sees a photo of himself on screen.
speaker_heading: X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
dialog: Is it true what they say? That he can
dialog: expand any part of his anatomy?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (ON TV)
dialog: Actually, between us, I think he's got
dialog: some problems staying rigid.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (finishing his thought to Ben)
dialog: ...wait for me...
speaker_heading: X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
dialog: Which may explain why this woman's

speaker_heading: SUE

scene_heading: EXT. NYC ARENA - DAY
text: The Thing rounds the corner. Sees a crowd of girls lined up

text: plates. Ben slows down, smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. NYC ARENA - A LITTLE LATER
text: Johnny and the Hot Babe exit, signing autographs for girls in

text: Johnny finds the Valet, who looks ill...his car is gone.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Where's my ride?
text: The Valet blows his whistle...and a 4 X 4 solid cube of RED
text: JUNK METAL slides down the street and stops at the curb in
text: front of Johnny. The Valet timidly holds out the keys...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: What the?! Is that my --
text: Before he can finish, Johnny gets PELTED IN THE HEAD with the
text: license plate. It rattles to the ground, face up.
text: Johnny rubs the sting out of his head. Looks up and sees Ben
text: in the distance, dusting off his hands.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: (shouting: to Ben)
dialog: You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.
dialog: (seeing Sue)
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You gave us names? What are you, the
dialog: "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
text: Ben marches up. Hands balled into fists.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: It's about to be a broken face.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need
dialog: to be careful until we're normal
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What if some of us don't want to be
dialog: "normal" again? We didn't all turn
dialog: into monsters like --
text: Ben reels back a FIST the size of an anvil. Stops himself.
text: Instead of attacking, he starts to walk off.
text: Johnny hurls a FIREBALL that SMACKS Ben in the back of the
text: head. Ben stops. Turns around more shocked than hurt.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Did you just --
text: Ben gets hit with ANOTHER FIREBALL. This time in the face.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, that's it, tinkerbell! You want
dialog: to fly? Fly.
text: Ben charges like a bull, fist cocked back, and...Reed steps
text: in the way! Too late! WHAMM! Ben's fist PUNCHES INTO
text: REED'S CHEST, which INDENTS. Reed's BACK EXPANDS with Ben's
text: fist, PUNCHING into Johnny, launching Johnny off his feet.
text: BAM! Johnny SLAMS into a moving ADVERTISING TRUCK, with a
text: BURGER KING flame-broiled WHOPPER on the side. WHOOSH! He
text: leaves a flaming imprint on the all-beef patty.
text: The crowd stands stunned. So do Reed and Sue. Cameras pop.
text: Johnny slowly pulls himself up. The paint on the truck
text: begins to bubble around his hand. Beaten, bruised, he
text: stands. Heating up. Both his hands are now flaming fists of
dialog: fury.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Let's see if we can get blood from a
dialog: stone.
text: He and Ben lock eyes, with a block of sidewalk between them.
text: High Noon. They start to RUN toward each other...
text: When they are almost within range, Sue STEPS BETWEEN THEM,
text: stops them both in their tracks with just a look. Like a
dialog: mom:
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You two need a time-out.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Blockhead started it!
text: Ben just stalks off. The crowd clears, scared. A PAPARAZZI
text: snaps a picture. Ben GRABS his camera, and flicks the lens.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - DAY
text: Sue looks at Johnny, more disappointed than angry.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Damn it, Johnny.
text: She goes after Ben, leaving Reed and Johnny on the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: You need to control yourself and think
dialog: before you --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if
dialog: we got these gifts for a reason? What
dialog: if we have some, you know...like,
dialog: calling?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: A higher calling like getting girls
dialog: and making money?
text: Johnny nods, totally missing the sarcasm.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Is there any higher?
text: Reed looks at him, disgusted. Johnny waves to the crowd,
text: hand flaming. People SHRIEK, snap pictures. Johnny smiles at
dialog: Reed.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is who we are Reed. Accept it.
dialog: Or better yet: enjoy it.
text: Johnny steps into the sea of fans. Reed stands alone.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET/ALLEY - DAY
text: Sue wades through the throng of New Yorkers. Tries to catch

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Ben! Slow down...

speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: He didn't mean it. You know Johnny.
dialog: He's always been a hothead --
speaker_heading: BEN
text: It's not him. It's them.
dialog: (pointing to crowd)
dialog: I can't live like this.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Just give Reed a little more time.
dialog: You know how he works -- analyzing
text: every little step before he takes
dialog: one --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It's easy for you to be patient.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No, it's not. I thought I was done
dialog: waiting for Reed... We're all in this
dialog: together now, Ben.
text: He slows down, gets closer, intense.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Together? Look at me, Susie. You got
dialog: no idea what I'd give...to be
dialog: invisible. Your nightmare...is my

dialog: TO --
scene_heading: INT. INVESTMENT BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: The news plays on the TV. Head Banker Ned Cecil freezes the

speaker_heading: NED CECIL
dialog: This is how you "turn things around"?
text: These freaks are on the front page and
dialog: your company's in the obituaries.

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I have a plan to use their publicity

speaker_heading: NED CECIL
dialog: Victor, stop. The bank's lost enough

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You need to look long-term here.
dialog: Without risk, there's no --
speaker_heading: NED CECIL
dialog: Reward. We all know the sales
dialog: pitch, Vic. And frankly, we're
dialog: done buying... Gentlemen.
text: He motions to his men. They all stand. Victor is the lone
text: man sitting. PUSH IN on Victor's face, his inner rage
text: palpable. A few quick surges of electricity emanate from his
text: body. This man is getting stronger, more electric.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - DAY
text: After hours. The floor is slick with water -- puddles in
text: every direction. Ned Cecil comes out of the elevator,
text: heading for his car. As he goes, the structure lights start
text: to flicker. Ned looks up, watches the lights go out one by
text: one, furthest to closest. He looks around. Unnerved by the
dialog: darkness.
speaker_heading: NED CECIL
dialog: Hello...?
text: A hanging beat. Victor steps out from shadows.
speaker_heading: NED CECIL (CONT'D)
dialog: (relieved, almost)
dialog: Von Doom? Gave me a little shock. No
dialog: hard feelings, right? Nothing
dialog: personal.
text: Victor says nothing. Ned keeps going.
speaker_heading: NED CECIL (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, you could always move back
dialog: to Latvura, start fresh.
text: He mispronounces Latveria, dripping condescension.
speaker_heading: NED CECIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe that's where you belong, back in
dialog: the "old country."
text: That does it. A surge of electricity courses through Victor.
text: His eyes narrow, and the electricity crackles down his leg to
text: THE GROUND. The electric spark hits the water and...
scene_heading: ELECTRIC CURRENTS RACE ACROSS THE GROUND, SLITHERING
text: LIGHTNING-FAST ACROSS THE WATER (like deadly electric
text: snakes), heading straight for Ned. His eyes go wide. And...
dialog: 
text: NED IS ELECTROCUTED! His body spasms. THUD! He slumps,
text: dead. Smoke rises from his body. Victor stands, power
dialog: swelling.
text: For the first time, his SCAR SPLITS OPEN, revealing a METAL
text: GLOW beneath the skin. He remains scary calm.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It's pronounced Latveria.
dialog: (looking down at the dead body)
dialog: This meeting's over, Ned.
text: Victor walks away, the final lights going to DARKNESS.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Victor enters, still adrenalized. He turns to the light
text: switch, and the lights come on. He approaches his screens,

text: One MONITOR rolls the news. IMAGES of the FANTASTIC FOUR.
text: Victor leans closer, and the VOLUME automatically goes up.

speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Sir, is everything okay? What

dialog: Everything he wanted...he took from me.
text: He leans ever closer, so the static starts to swallow Reed.
text: A hard, deadly beat. Victor's eyes narrow, zooming
text: into...REED'S RESEARCH: SLIDES on the wall. He zooms into
dialog: key words:
scene_heading: DANGER, UNSTABLE IONS, MUTATION, OVERLOAD. And Victor gives
text: a slow, thin smile. A new plan forming.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Now I'm going to take it back. Piece
dialog: by bloody piece...
text: His fist clenches. We hear METALLIC SFX.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY
text: Reed enters the room carrying a stack of boxes that no normal
text: man could balance. But he is not normal. His arms are
text: wrapped around the boxes five times over -- like human twine.
text: He stops short, and drops the boxes when he sees...
text: VICTOR overseeing a group of TECHNICIANS. They are boxing up
text: Reed's work -- all of his equipment, research. Victor wears
text: a bandage, covering his scar. Reed eyes a glint of METAL.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Victor, are you...are you okay?
text: Victor turns away.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Don't worry about me. Worry about
dialog: yourself.
text: Reed looks around, seeing his lab turned inside out.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What I should have done a long time
dialog: ago. Applications and patents, Reed.
dialog: This all belongs to me.
text: Reed reaches out, grabbing a folder from a box.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: But I'm not done with the machine --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Which is precisely the point.
dialog: Analysis is over. It's time for
dialog: action. My men could have mass-
dialog: produced this by now.
text: Reed shakes his head, defending himself.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Mass-produced? This isn't a
dialog: toaster. You have no idea how it
dialog: works.
text: Victor pulls the folder from Reed's hand, and whips out the
text: intricate DIAGRAM of the MACHINE. He points to parts:
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Re-create the storm, invert the
dialog: polarity here, reverse the mutation
dialog: there. Don't talk to me like I'm some
dialog: schoolboy. I've got the same Phd you
dialog: do.
text: Reed is a little surprised that Victor is so familiar with
text: his machine. He points to a SECURE CHAMBER on the blueprint.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: The storm needs to be handled exactly
dialog: right, or it could make our mutations
dialog: worse, much worse, maybe even kill
dialog: us...
text: Victor slows. Is Reed getting to him? Or giving him ideas?
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: Victor, please. We need time to
dialog: verify the data... We can't afford any
dialog: mistakes -- there's only enough ions
dialog: for two or three attempts.
text: Victor considers. He seems to enjoy watching Reed dangle.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Reed. I'm not asking permission.
dialog: (a final verdict)
dialog: We'll build it, while you check the
dialog: specs.
text: Victor walks out. Reed looks unsure, as we CUT TO --
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY
text: The SHIELDS slowly rise. FIVE TECHNICIANS go to work. They
text: wear the VDI jackets. Reed watches, worried.
text: Sue enters. She sees the shields, the technicians, the VDI
text: logo. And she is deeply worried. She steps over to Reed.
text: Sparks fly behind them. Drills scream.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Can I talk to you?
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Sue steps into the office, followed by Reed. Quiet, urgent:
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Don't let Victor push you into making
dialog: a mistake --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: He was going to take away all my data,
dialog: equipment --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Better than your life. Victor's not
dialog: the one who has to get into that
dialog: thing. We are.
text: Reed starts to snap, losing his studied cool.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Which is why I'm working twenty hours
dialog: a day, checking every variable --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Every variable but yourself. You
dialog: don't eat, sleep. You can't live in
dialog: your head like --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: (finally losing it)
dialog: I'm not the only one in there. I got
dialog: you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling
text: around in there.
text: Sue stands there, shocked by his outburst. A beat.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: So clear it out. Get out of your
dialog: head. Get out of here...
text: He looks at her, knowing what she means. Where she means.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY
text: Ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street,
text: mind tossing and turning. People stare, point. A LITTLE
text: GIRL and FRIEND run up to him.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Mister, Mister! Please help me! My
text: kitty is stuck in a tree.
text: She gestures to a tree next to Ben. Looks up.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: Please save Miss Lucy.
text: Ben rolls his eyes. Looks up. Considers climbing the tree,
dialog: but thinks better of it. He has another idea...
text: Ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap
text: out of it. MEEEEEEOOOOOOOWWWWRRRRRRR!!!!
text: The cat falls into frame. At the last instant, Ben sticks
text: out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm. He hands
text: the cat to the girl. Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks.
text: He just moves on.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT
text: Ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses A LARGE
text: SCULPTURE of his bust.
text: He stops, steps back to take a look. It's exquisitely
dialog: rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the
text: haunting anguish in his eyes. Ben is amazed, and touched,
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (under breath)
dialog: Eyebrows are a little big...
text: A beat. He stares at these images of himself.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I figured the only way to get you here
dialog: was to stick that in the window.
text: He turns to see...ALICIA in the doorway.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: How'd you know it was me?
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
text: He steps toward her. But he sees...a PARTY in the back part
text: of the gallery. Ben pauses, a little insecure.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm not really dressed for a party.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Relax, it's casual.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
text: She smiles, a thought forming, as we CUT TO --
scene_heading: INT. GALLERY - STUDIO - NIGHT
text: WHOOSH! A SCULPTOR'S HOSE sprays a thin stream of water at
text: BEN. Alicia cleans Ben with her hands, using thin CARVING
text: CHISELS for his cracks. Intricate, intimate work.
text: Ben enjoys every moment. He eyes a couple, large PUPPETS in
dialog: the corner.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Those yours too?
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: My step-dad's. I'm strictly into
dialog: stone. I was wondering when you'd
dialog: walk by.
speaker_heading: THE THING
dialog: You know, you could'a run an ad in the
dialog: personals.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: "Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton,
dialog: rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual
dialog: relationship."
speaker_heading: THE THING
dialog: This ain't permanent. My friend
dialog: Reed's working on a cure...I think.
text: She gets closer, running her hands across his arm.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Bennie. You feel pretty good as is.
text: Ben bristles. He doesn't want to stay this way.
speaker_heading: THE THING
dialog: You don't know what it's like out
text: there. Walking around like some kind
text: of circus freak. People staring,
dialog: whispering --
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: I wouldn't know anything about that.
speaker_heading: THE THING
dialog: I mean...
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Tell me. When you grew up in
dialog: Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you
dialog: know?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You went your own way then. You
dialog: didn't listen to people. So why start
dialog: now...?
text: As he ponders that, we hear a CROWD SWELLING on the CUT TO --
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Fans swarm JOHNNY. He signs autographs, poses for pictures.
text: Then his eyes move to...an incredibly long stretch LIMO. A
text: tinted window rolls down. Victor's face emerges.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Need a ride, Johnny?
scene_heading: EXT./INT. LIMO - NIGHT
text: Johnny climbs in, sees...three impossibly gorgeous MODELS.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: A few fans. Hope you don't mind.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Gotta take care of the fans, right?
text: He smiles, sitting down in the middle of them.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Look, I built my business knowing what
dialog: people want. And right now, the
dialog: people want you.
text: Johnny eyes the models, all lusting.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: And we don't want to let the people
dialog: down now, do we?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: No we don't. Which is why we need
dialog: to strike while the iron's hot.
dialog: I'm talking action figures,
dialog: videogames, sponsors --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Videogames? You serious?
text: Victor nods, knowing he has Johnny on the hook.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: You talk to Reed and Sue about this?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Johnny. Let's be honest here. Ben,
dialog: Reed, Sue. Good people, all. But
dialog: stars?
text: (shaking his head, a beat)
dialog: I don't want to break up the band, but
dialog: you're the one they want. Don't you
dialog: think it's time to go solo...?
text: Victor subtly nods to the models. They envelop Johnny.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Take the car for a spin. Think about
dialog: it. Is this the life you want? Or
dialog: would you rather live in Reed's
dialog: lab...?
text: The car stops. Victor gets out. He stands on the pavement.
text: As he shuts the door, we see the women climbing onto Johnny.
text: The door shuts, and...
text: WHHHMMMPF! The windows all suddenly STEAM UP!
scene_heading: INT. HAYDEN PLANETARIUM - NIGHT
text: STARS on the ceiling. A VOICE drones about the galaxy. In
text: the LAST ROW, we find: Reed and Sue. Reed is thinking about
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I could get Ben to tap into the
dialog: Baxter's main power to generate enough
dialog: voltage --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look
dialog: up.
text: He slowly looks up. The stars seem to calm him.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember our first date here...? God,
dialog: I was so nervous.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: You were?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Of course I was. I'd read all your
dialog: papers on bioethics. Some of them two
dialog: times just so I'd have something to
dialog: say to you.
text: Reed smiles softly, thinking back.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: You know, I bribed the projectionist
dialog: ten bucks to keep it open late?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I gave him twenty.
text: They laugh. Sue looks up to the stars. Quiet:
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't want that night to end.
text: Reed looks at her. Wrestles with a decision. Then quietly:
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Sue, you were right. It wasn't
dialog: complicated. I just wasn't ready to
dialog: be...to become...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You can be a little intimidating.
text: She knows. He trails off. Sue looks at him.
speaker_heading: REED (CONT'D)
dialog: You always talked about how you liked
dialog: the kind of man who could approach
dialog: you...speak his mind. One who wasn't
dialog: afraid to tell you what he wanted.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I did. I did, Reed...but I wanted
dialog: you to be that man.
text: Someone SHUSHES them. They slump down further. Closer.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: When I walked out, I waited ten
dialog: minutes outside your door. Ten.
dialog: Waiting for you to come find me.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Why didn't you say something?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: That would have kinda defeated the
dialog: purpose. And Reed...
dialog: (closer, emotional)
dialog: I'm saying it now.
text: Their eyes lock. A heated beat. No more secrets. Their
text: faces are close. A kiss is coming. Closer, closer. Sue
dialog: disappears.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: (quiet, playful)
dialog: Come find me.
text: Reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and...
speaker_heading: SUE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: That's my nose, genius... These are my
dialog: lips.
text: Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible
text: hands. She pulls him into a KISS. Lips touch. Soft,
text: tender. Stars twinkle. And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --
scene_heading: EXT. KIRBY GALLERY - NIGHT
text: Ben and Alicia step out together. The crowd quiets, turns.
text: A few whispers flutter. Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips
text: her arm into his. The party goes back to normal.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: Look around. I'll get us drinks.
dialog: They always let blind girls cut the
dialog: line.
text: She walks off. He watches her go. The way her hair moves.
text: The lines of her neck. The light on her skin. This woman is
text: the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen. He's falling
dialog: hard.
text: Ben steps through the crowd. The swanky guests give strained
text: smiles, polite. Ben is starting to feel comfortable here.
text: He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests.
dialog: 
text: Ben hangs back, happy to watch her. A few patrons pass him,
text: thinking he's just an inanimate statue.
speaker_heading: PATRON
dialog: I don't know about this one. It lacks
dialog: a certain...realism.
text: Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia. He overhears two BOHEMIAN
text: GIRLS, who assume he's a statue.
speaker_heading: BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
dialog: She's always had a thing for runaways
dialog: and strays, but this is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: BOHEMIAN GIRL #2
dialog: I know. Did she really think these
dialog: sculptures would sell?
speaker_heading: BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
dialog: Like anybody would want this thing in
dialog: their house. That girl's a one-woman
dialog: charity.
text: Ben just stands there, frozen. His eyes dart around the
text: room, paranoid now. Aware of people staring, laughing. He
text: glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else. Ten
text: seconds ago, this would have been dreamy. Now it's damning.
text: We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging
text: where she left Ben. She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for
text: him. But Ben is gone. She looks disappointed, hearing his
text: heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance.
text: THUNDER booms on the CUT TO --
scene_heading: EXT./INT. DINER - NIGHT
text: A pitstop in Queens. Heavy RAIN swims down windows. BEN
text: sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight.
text: Nobody sits within four chairs of him. He sips coffee in a
text: metal bowl. A long beat. Then...
speaker_heading: VICTOR (O.S.)
dialog: This seat taken?
text: Ben turns to see...VICTOR.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I'm worried about you.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: About me? How sweet.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Come on. Let me buy you something to
dialog: eat. Looks like you could use the
dialog: company.
text: Ben considers. A man deeply alone. A beat.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - LATER
text: Victor and Ben sit in a window booth. A waitress sets a
text: foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge
text: plates he's just cleared. Victor's aware of the other
text: customers in the diner staring at Ben. Ben burps: it rattles
dialog: the plates.
speaker_heading: THE THING
dialog: 'Scuse me.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't
dialog: changed that much for Reed, Sue and
dialog: Johnny. At least they can go out in
dialog: public. But for you? People staring.
dialog: Whispering behind your back...
speaker_heading: THE THING
dialog: If you're trying to cheer me up you're
dialog: doing a helluva job --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I'm just saying, I know what it's like
dialog: to lose something you love. To see it
dialog: slip away, and know it's never coming
dialog: back.
text: The Thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth.
speaker_heading: THE THING
dialog: Reed's gonna fix me up --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: For your sake I hope you're right.
dialog: I'm sorry if that sounds a little
dialog: skeptical.
speaker_heading: THE THING
dialog: Skeptical...?
text: Ben doesn't trust him. But Victor is hitting pressure
dialog: points.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Look, he's a brilliant man, we should
dialog: trust he's working as hard as he can.
dialog: You're his best friend. So what
dialog: possible reason could he have for
dialog: taking his time?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I mean, other than getting close to
dialog: Sue?
dialog: Off The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted. He can't
dialog: help but find truth in the words. And we CUT TO --
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT
text: Reed and Sue return, laughing quietly, bodies close. Reed
text: turns on the lights, and they flinch when they see...BEN. He
text: sits waiting, scowling. They stop laughing immediately.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah, I have that effect on people.
text: The construction of the TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER is complete.
text: The Technicians are gone now.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Ben --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh, you remember my name do you? You
dialog: happen to remember what you swore to
dialog: do with every breath in your body?
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: We're working as hard as we can --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
text: He motions to Reed and Sue together.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Come on, this is nothing.
text: Sue looks a little hurt.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Glad "nothing" could take you away
dialog: from your work.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Ben, I don't know if this thing'll
dialog: change us back or make us worse.
dialog: I need you to be patient for a little
dialog: while longe--
text: He POKES his finger into Reed's chest, which INDENTS around
text: it like the Pillsbury Doughboy. Ben pushes Reed back. Hard.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Look at me, Reed. Look at me!
text: He grabs Reed's face, his fingers INDENTING the skin. He
text: THROWS Reed back. Reed slams down to the ground.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I am looking. That's why I can't make
dialog: a mistake! I've got to get it right,
dialog: and it's not right yet! We need to
dialog: test this.
text: Ben shakes his head, looking down at Reed.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I spent my whole life protecting you,
dialog: from the schoolyard to the stars. For
dialog: what? So you could play Twister with
dialog: your girlfriend while I'm the freak of
dialog: the week?
text: Reed tries to stand, but Ben KNOCKS him back. Reed slams
text: into the wall, and stays down this time.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Ben! Stop it! Or I'll stop it.
text: She starts to raise her hands to throw force-fields.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Stay out of this Susie.
text: As Ben turns to her, Reed takes this opportunity to WRAP Ben
text: up like a python. They struggle. Ben runs back into a wall
text: to shake Reed. Their faces are close, heated.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Good thing you're flexible enough to
dialog: watch your own back. 'Cause you're on
dialog: your own now.
text: Ben seems to relax and Reed lets go. Ben walks out. Sue
text: comes to Reed's side. He's bleeding.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I'm OK. Just go, go after him. Stop
dialog: him.
text: She heads out. Reed slowly stands. He looks at the
text: transformation machine. It's not ready. But...Reed steps
text: toward it. As he walks, his image goes grainy in --
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Victor gets closer to his screens, watching Reed's every
text: step. This is what Victor has been waiting for. His screens
text: flicker with static -- he's too close, but he can't pull
text: back. He sees: REED TURNS ON THE MACHINE. Hits a countdown.
text: And he grabs his UNIFORM...
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Sue hustles down the long hall. Ben turns a corner, passing
text: the elevators, heading toward a FREIGHT ELEVATOR. She gets
text: there too late. Doors close, going down.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Ben pounds across the lobby. He sees Johnny coming in.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Christmas come early! Check it out!
text: He holds up an ACTION FIGURE of BEN: a horribly bloated body
text: topped by a tiny pinhead. Johnny pushes a button and --
speaker_heading: BEN ACTION FIGURE
text: IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!
text: WITH ONE ARM, Ben shoves Johnny into a wall. With his other
text: hand, Ben grabs the toy and SMASHES it into the wall, inches
text: from Johnny's head. The toy lodges into the plaster.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Hey! That's a prototype!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Go back to the drawing board.
text: He strides away.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
text: DING. Sue speeds out of the elevator. No sign of Ben. She
text: runs into...JOHNNY who shakes off the encounter.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Johnny? Did you see Ben?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm
dialog: done with this freak show. I'm moving
text: back to the real world.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Is that what you call it? "Real"?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: At least it beats living in a lab like
dialog: somebody's science project.
text: This hits home. Sue is quiet. Johnny turns to go.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Johnny, slow down. Think. You know
dialog: mom didn't raise us to --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Look around, sis! She's not here. So
dialog: you can stop talking to me like I'm
dialog: your little boy --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: As soon as you stop acting like one.
dialog: Come on, you're smarter than this.
dialog: You think those people out there care
dialog: about you? You're just a fad to them.
text: He pulls away from her, taking a step out the door.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Let's try something new: you live
dialog: your life. And I'll live mine.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And just for the record: they LOVE
dialog: me.
text: He strides into the night, leaving Sue alone. A dark night.
text: The Fantastic Four is no more. The family is split apart.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT
text: The transformation chamber is up and running. Numbers count
text: down. The storm swirls in the chamber. Reed now wears the
text: UNIFORM. He opens the door:
text: HE'S GOING TO USE IT ON HIMSELF. HE IS FINALLY TAKING
dialog: ACTION.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Victor sits enthralled. He leans forward, breathless.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT
text: Reed gets closer. His heart races. So does Victor's. A
text: moment of truth for both of them. REED STEPS INTO THE
speaker_heading: MACHINE.
text: Reed looks up at the cosmic storm. He opens his arms, ready
text: to risk his life. And...WHHHM! He JOLTS in JUMP-CUT-MOTION,
text: RECONFIGURING, JERKING out of control, and we CUT TO --
scene_heading: VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: His screens GO BLACK. He looks out the window to see...a
text: flash atop the BAXTER BUILDING. The tip of the Baxter glows.
text: The rest of its lights GO OUT, FLICKERING in a power surge.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Lights go haywire. Sue knows immediately...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Oh god, Reed.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT
text: Lights flicker in darkness. The door rips open. Sue lunges
text: inside. She sees through smoke and sparks...REED sways in
text: the chamber. A beat. Did it work? Then...
text: Reed SLUMPS TO THE GROUND. His eyes flutter back. Dead...?
text: His body is warped, twisted -- one half remains tense, hard,
text: while the other half is loose, soft, almost melted.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What did you do, Reed? What did you
dialog: do?
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Victor watches every second on his monitors.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT
text: Sue struggles to lift Reed -- half of his body is STRETCHED
text: OUT, devoid of any semblance of bone structure. One side of
text: his face looks like it's MELTING OFF.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I can...make it work.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: The power...I need...more power...to
dialog: control...the storm --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You need a doctor.
text: Reed loses consciousness. Sue carries him out.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Victor watches, his eyes narrow, looking at his hands.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: More power...?
text: He reaches out for his phone, and...his SPEAKERPHONE
text: AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON. His powers growing.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (TO PHONE) (CONT'D)
dialog: Leonard. Bring me our lab rat.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Ben sits alone, looking at city lights. A man without a
text: home. Without a family. A hard beat. HEADLIGHTS slash
text: across Ben. He slowly turns, blinded in the lights of...a
speaker_heading: LIMO.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Ben! They need you back at the Baxter
dialog: building. It's...Reed.
text: Ben considers. Despite it all, he's a good friend. And a
text: good man. As he gets into the car, we hear THROBBING MUSIC
dialog: IN --
scene_heading: INT. MANHATTAN NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
text: LOUD MUSIC and PULSATING LIGHTS. A young crowd dances and
text: grinds to the beat. Among the colorful lights, STREAKS OF
text: FLAME swirl around the ceiling. We follow them to:
text: A BALCONY, where we see JOHNNY sitting in a cozy VIP section.
text: He's surrounded by "groupies" climbing over each other to get
text: a look at his various parlour tricks.
text: He leans closer to a YOUNG WOMAN. Closer. Candles around
text: them start to melt. Beads of sweat drip down her face.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What do you say we get out of here?
text: She pauses. And...a very LARGE MAN steps up.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: This your boyfriend?
text: The Boyfriend doesn't look too happy.
speaker_heading: BOYFRIEND
dialog: Is that all you do? Bar tricks and
dialog: stealing chicks...
text: Johnny does one more trick...taps the guy's drink...igniting

text: which SMASHES on the ground...catches the floor on fire.
text: The boyfriend quickly moves in and stamps it out.
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: What are you doing?! You could have
dialog: burned somebody!
text: The boyfriend takes his girlfriend's hand, they start to walk
text: off. She turns back for one last comment...
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, if I had your power I'd be
dialog: doing something with it, not wasting
dialog: my time doing cheap bar tricks,
text: hitting on some other guy's girl.
text: Johnny looks a little embarrassed. The couple leaves.
text: Johnny glances around. His FANS look down, away. He sees
text: how quickly they can turn. The crowd parts slightly. He
text: looks very alone.
scene_heading: INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: Leonard leads The Thing inside. The ominous chamber sits
text: with its door open. Victor enters from the control station.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Ben, come in.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What is this? Where's Reed?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Where do you think? With Sue.
text: Ben looks at the flickering lights. Suspicious. Victor
text: turns to Leonard, who looks a little scared by this dark
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: I'll take it from here, Leonard.
text: Leonard nods, all too eager to get the hell out of here.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Yes sir.
text: Leonard disappears fast, as Victor turns back to Ben.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What do you want, Vic?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: To help you. I've run every test
dialog: known to man. And they all yield the
text: same result: the machine is ready.
text: Ben shakes his head, wanting to believe, but...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Reed said it'd be weeks till --
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: He also said we'd avoid that storm in
dialog: space. And we know how that turned
dialog: out.
text: Ben nods. Reed was wrong before. Ben gets closer to the
text: machine, drawn to it. He wants to believe, so badly.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: He couldn't generate enough power for
text: the machine to reach critical mass.
dialog: Yet another mistake for "Mr.
dialog: Fantastic."
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: And you can? Power it up?
text: Victor stands in shadows, but we see the tiniest little SPARK
text: around him. The lights...? Or his skin...?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Yes. I've found a new energy source.
text: He keeps his arm behind his back -- his fingertips course
text: with ELECTRICITY. It starts to build, sparking up his arm.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me...do you want to be Ben Grimm
dialog: again?
text: Ben keeps his eyes on the machine. His dream is alive.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Let's do it.
scene_heading: INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: The chamber doors open. Thing enters. He looks around this
text: sterile box. An animal in a cage. Victor pushes a control;
text: the doors of the chamber slowly close and seal. Thing shuts
text: his eyes. He just wants to be Ben again.
text: FROM THE CONTROLS: Victor initiates the transformation
text: sequence. As lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in
text: the lab. Energy pumps into the chamber. The storm swirls
text: faster. Lights flicker...there's not enough power, until --
text: -- Victor walks over...grabs hold of the machine with both
text: hands...and WHHHM! A countdown begins in the control panels.
text: SLOW MOVE IN on the chamber, The Thing's face in the window.
text: The chamber activates. The storm strikes hard.
text: The Thing opens his mouth, a beat, then he screams in agony.
text: Struggling violently inside. To escape? Extend the moment:
text: Condensation obscures the chamber window: The Thing vanishes.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT
text: The city lights fill the sky, and give it a quiet, eerie
text: glow. Suddenly, a BRIGHT FLASH emerges from the window of
text: the Baxter Building. The rest of the city lights dim
dialog: slightly.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Reed lies in bed, weak, recuperating. When the power surges,
text: we MOVE in on him: he looks up in alarm, knowing that
text: someone's using the chamber. He starts to get out of bed,
text: straining to stand with every muscle left in his body.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Sue sifts through a cabinet full of medications. The lights
text: dim. Power failure. She looks up...
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
text: Johnny walks alone. A WAVE OF LIGHT spreads through the sky.
text: He looks up. His eyes adjust to the blast, as he realizes
text: where it's coming from. He starts RUNNING toward the Baxter.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT
text: INSIDE THE MACHINE, the RED CLOUD swirls with debris,
text: crackling with light. The chamber rattles dangerously, as
text: the power seems to SHAKE the very foundation of the building.
text: And then it's over. The light dies down...somewhat. It
text: still pulses along with the chamber. The chamber door SLIDES
speaker_heading: OPEN.
text: Beat. And...BEN GRIMM steps out. Not The Thing. No more
text: rocks. BEN GRIMM. Naked, tired, but finally A NORMAL MAN.
text: He slips on his trench-coat -- now way too large. He
text: collapses. He stares at his hands, his arms...it worked.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh my God... Th-thank you. THANK
dialog: YOU...VIC?!
text: Ben sees a SPARK in shadows. That spark is...
text: VICTOR'S ARM. Victor steps forward, and reveals himself to
text: Ben: ELECTRICITY PUMPS THROUGH HIS BODY. His skin is part
text: flesh, part metal. Cheekbone exposed, steel tissue.
text: HE IS DOOM.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Vic... What the...?
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: Everyone thought I was safe behind
dialog: those shields...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Victor, the machine worked for me. It
dialog: can work for you --
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: It did, Ben. It worked perfectly.
text: Ben starts to realize...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You planned this...?
text: Doom smiles, reaches out his hand -- ELECTRICITY builds from
text: his shoulders, coursing down his arms to his fingertips.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: I've always wanted power. Now I've
dialog: got an unlimited supply...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: And no Thing to stand in your way.
text: DOOM smiles, nods, stronger than Ben now.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: Take a good look, Ben. This is what a
text: man looks like who embraces his
dialog: destiny.
text: Doom clenches his fist and BLASTS Ben, sending him flying
text: backwards across the room -- knocked unconscious.
speaker_heading: DOOM (CONT'D)
dialog: One down, three to go.
text: Suddenly, WHOOSH! The lab door flies open. Reed enters.
text: Doom steps back into the shadows.
speaker_heading: DOOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Right on cue.
text: Reed's eyes go wide. He sees Ben crumpled in the corner.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Oh god Ben. Are you okay?
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: You did it, you really did it...
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: No, Reed. I did.
text: Reed slowly turns to see...DOOM. His body, his face.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Victor...? What, what happened to
dialog: you? What did you do to your --
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: Exactly what I said I would: I built a
dialog: better, stronger being. And
dialog: outsmarted the great Reed Richards --
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Victor, this isn't the way to --
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: (a dark smile)
dialog: You always know best. So tell me.
dialog: What happens when you superheat
dialog: rubber?
text: Doom BLASTS an electrical BOLT at Reed, KNOCKING Reed through
text: the huge window! Reed's body RUBBER-BANDS from the blast.
scene_heading: EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Reed SLINKIES down the face of the building, skin rippling.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT
text: Doom looks out the window, smiling at his old friend's fall.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - FRONT LOBBY - NIGHT
text: DING! The elevator opens. Doom strides out. He passes our
text: friend O'HOOLIHAN, who looks scared.
speaker_heading: O'HOOLIHAN
dialog: Mr. Von Doom? Are you oka--
text: Doom casually SWIPES, sending him through revolving doors.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: Never better, Jimmy. And it's Doctor
dialog: Doom now.
scene_heading: EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Reed MELTS down the sides of an AWNING, like a Salvador Dali
text: watch. He tries to GRAB HOLD of window ledges, but he can't
text: get a grip. His ARM streeetches, and SNAP! He falls like a
text: SLINKY, out of control. Half his body loose, half hard.
text: He drips to the sidewalk, where...Doom steps out. He catches
text: Reed's face, holds it close.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: Why the long face?
text: Doom whips Reed into the night. As Doom turns, people cower,
text: horrified by his face. They clear out, and...
text: Doom sees his REFLECTION in a window: scarred skin, metallic
text: veins. A monster. Infuriated, he SHATTERS the window with
text: an iron fist, and bounds into the night.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT
text: Smoke billows, windows are shattered. Sue races inside,
text: seeing Doom's devastation. Silence, deadly silence.
text: Then...she sees a pile of WRECKAGE shift. BEN crawls out.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Ben?!
text: She helps him out of the rubble. He is beaten, battered.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (O.S.)
dialog: Sue!
text: Johnny comes running in. He sees the wreckage.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
text: He nods. A beat between them. He looks around, sees Ben.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Jesus, Ben!
dialog: (eyeing him)
dialog: I go away, look what happens. You got
dialog: a lot of explaining to do.
text: He motions to the wreckage.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (struggling, weak)
text: The machine works. And Vic's gone
dialog: Mister Hyde on us --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Really? With a name like Von Doom?
dialog: Never saw that one coming.
text: Sue looks around. Only one question. Dead serious:
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Where is Reed?
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Victor must've taken him.
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Doom sits at the head of the table in an eerie parallel to
text: the opening scene. Those mysterious CRATES loom in shadows.
text: He wears a green HOOD, and METAL MASK over his scarred face.
text: Doom's eyes turn toward...the other end of the table.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: Chemistry 101, Part Two. What
dialog: happens to rubber when it's super-
dialog: cooled?
text: We now see what he sees: Reed sits in a chair with TUBES
text: INJECTED into his skin FREEZING HIM SOLID! Ultra-cold vapor
text: coats him. Doom steps closer, a sadistic smile.
text: Reed tries to move but can't even ball his hand into a fist.
speaker_heading: DOOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Allow me.
text: He PRESSES DOWN on one of Reed's fingers, which makes a
text: horrific CRACKING SOUND. Reed's face twists with pain.
speaker_heading: DOOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Painful...?
text: Doom seems to enjoy every CRACK. He leans closer.
speaker_heading: DOOM (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't know the meaning of the
dialog: word.
text: Doom lets up on Reed and reaches into a crate, and pulls out
text: a military-issue ROCKET-LAUNCHER. He aims at the city
text: skyline, locking onto his target: JOHNNY STORM.
speaker_heading: DOOM (CONT'D)
dialog: But you will.
text: Johnny's HEAT SIGNATURE glows. The screen flashes: TARGET
text: ACQUIRED. Doom looks back at Reed, his launcher aimed
text: casually over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: DOOM (CONT'D)
text: Flame off.
text: BOOOOM! He fires without looking! A MISSILE blasts into the
text: sky. THE MISSILE LIGHTS UP THE DARK NIGHT beginning its wide
text: turn towards its target.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING
text: Johnny, Ben, and Sue hear the missile being fired and turn to
text: the window -- it BANKS, coming STRAIGHT for them. They move
dialog: to --
scene_heading: EXT. BAXTER BUILDING BALCONY - NIGHT
text: Johnny rushes toward the edge, to get a good look at the
text: missile streaking closer. As he moves, the missile SHIFTS
text: slightly with HIS MOTION! His eyes narrow, thinking.
text: He FLAMES ON a HAND. He waves his flaming hand, and the
text: MISSILE locks onto the fire! Johnny darkens, realizing...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Great. Heat-seeker.
text: His mind races. He makes a decision, and steps up onto the
text: ledge, hundreds of feet above the street.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What are you doing --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Sis. Let me take care of you for
dialog: once.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: But Johnny...you can't fly.
text: Johnny considers, a half-beat. He looks out. Under breath:
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Well then this'll be one hell of a
dialog: basejump.
text: Sue reaches out to stop him, but Johnny DIVES HEROICALLY OFF
text: THE EDGE! He FLAMES ON! The missile follows his arc. As he
text: drops, his clothes BURN OFF, revealing his UNIFORM.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: (under breath)
dialog: Come on...come on...come on...
text: He falls lower, lower. And...he...BANKS! SWOOPS UP!
dialog: FLYING!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
text: FLAME ON.
text: Sue watches, with fear, and a hint of pride.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We need to help Reed --
text: Sue shakes her head, sympathetic.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Ben, you got what we all wanted.
dialog: You need to stay here. It's too
dialog: dangerous.
text: She heads off. Ben watches her go, helpless.
scene_heading: INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT
text: Ben steps back into this ravaged room. Through the shattered
text: window, he sees Johnny's FLAMES streaking away. A hard beat.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What...what have I done?
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT
text: Johnny zigs and zags, but the missile takes every twist and
text: turn, gaining on him, bearing down. Cars slow, stop. More
text: people look up, scared, pointing at this stunning sight.
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Eerily silent. Reed tries to move, but he is FROZEN. He
text: hears a footstep. But the room is EMPTY. No sign of Doom
text: even. A beat. He hears a CREAK. Another CREAK, closer.
dialog: And...
text: A FREEZING TUBE starts to SHIFT. It goes taut, clearly being
text: manipulated by a hand -- an INVISIBLE HAND. Sue APPEARS next
text: to Reed, tube in hand. She tries to stay calm.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What has he done to you?
text: Reed's eyes shift to see...Doom emerge from the darkness.
speaker_heading: DOOM (O.S.)
dialog: How romantic.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Victor, please --
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: It's Doctor Doom to you.
text: He steps closer. Electrodes course over his metal skin.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We know the machine works. It worked
dialog: on Ben, it'll work on you. We can
dialog: turn you back --
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: Do you really think fate turned us
dialog: into gods so we could refuse these
dialog: gifts?
text: She hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Victor. You always thought you were
dialog: god.
text: Doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: Sue please, let's not fight.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No, Victor... Let's.
text: She HURLS a force-field at him. It CONNECTS, KNOCKING him
text: back a half-step. But he simply shakes it off, and steps up.
text: Too powerful. He smiles. His arms CRACKLE with electricity.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: Susan...... You're fired.
text: BOOM! He FIRES an ELECTRIC SHOCKWAVE that LAUNCHES her back.
text: She spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, THUDDING
text: to the floor. As Doom stalks closer, Sue gathers her
dialog: strength to...GO INVISIBLE.
speaker_heading: DOOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Marco...
text: A hanging beat. We see: a FAINT OUTLINE of Sue behind him.
speaker_heading: DOOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Polo.
text: He SPINS, GRABS her! Doom grips her neck, SLAMMING her to
text: the ground beside Reed. She lays there, beaten, visible.
text: In the distance behind Doom, city lights BLINK, fading in and
text: out. Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through
text: the machine). Reed looks up. Could it be...?
scene_heading: EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT
text: Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet
text: behind him. He's running out of options, when he spots:
text: A GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead. Thinking fast,
text: Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge.
text: VWOOSH! The flames ignite and spread quickly.
text: He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes
text: in on him. Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit --
text: JOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water. As he tumbles
text: through the air, we CUT BACK TO --
scene_heading: INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
text: From their vantage point, they see the missile explode.
text: Flames dance. Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck.
text: Reed tries desperately to move, but he is FROZEN. It takes
text: every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes
text: a CRACCCKKKKING sound.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: One more down. Now it's just the
text: scientist and his specimen.
text: Sue and Reed lock eyes. Reed tries to move his mouth. He
text: has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips
dialog: and get the words out.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Sue. The only thing I ever knew
dialog: without thinking was...
dialog: (his lips fully freezing)
dialog: I...love...
text: He starts to say "you," but his lips FREEZE, mid-word. Sue
dialog: whispers to him:
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Me too, Reed.
text: Doom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: (quiet, cruel)
dialog: And so four became none. It's my time
dialog: now.
text: BOOOOM! An elevator DOOR FLIES INTO THE ROOM! SMASH!
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Actually, Vic...
text: Reed recognizes the voice. So do we. Doom turns to see...
text: BEN GRIMM, AKA THE THING. Back in rocky, fighting form.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!
dialog: Doom turns, just as --
text: BAM! Ben HITS Doom harder than any living thing has ever
text: been hit. The force sends Doom back through the air, toward
text: the far wall, where he SMASHES into the massive "V"
text: sculpture. It SNAPS, crashing onto him. A few sparks. Then
dialog: nothing.
text: Nothing at all. No more movement. Doom is dead.
text: Ben turns to Reed.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn, I've been wanting to do that.
text: Reed manages the thinnest smile as Ben starts disconnecting
text: the tubes from Reed.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: (Reed's words)
dialog: Victor's "not that bad," huh? Just "a
dialog: little larger than life"? Maybe
dialog: you'll listen to me next time before --
text: WHMM! The WRECKAGE shifts. They turn to see...Doom EMERGES.
text: He stands, power coursing. And he CHARGES at Ben! Ben
dialog: charges back. And these two behemoths...
text: SLAM INTO EACH OTHER, CRASHING THROUGH GLASS, INTO THIN AIR!!
scene_heading: EXT. VON DOOM BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
text: Doom and Ben PLUMMET, wrestling in mid-air. On the ground,
text: PEOPLE scream and duck for cover. Doom and Ben SMASH through
text: the large GLASS roof of a lower building across the street.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS
text: BOOOOM! Doom and Ben, locked in combat, drop through the
text: glass, landing in a large HOTEL POOL. People scream, run.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - NIGHT
text: UNDERWATER: Doom and Ben LAND HARD. Their combined weight
text: CRACKS the floor of the pool. A YOUNG BOY watches underwater
text: through his MASK. Doom and Ben square off, but...
text: The CRACKS OPEN WIDER! And they're PULLED toward the HOLE!
text: WHOOSH! The water is all sucked out of the hole. The boy
text: holds tight to a ladder, as Ben and Doom crash down to --
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: A HOTEL GUEST sees water FLOOD into the hall. Roaring rapids
text: head straight for him. He jams his key into the lock,
text: turning desperately, just barely leaping out of the way as
text: the wave carrying BEN and DOOM SMASHES through a window to --
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
text: SMASH! Ben and Doom fly out the window, thrashing in the
scene_heading: TEN THOUSAND-GALLON WATERFALL TO --
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: CRASH! Water floods the street. Doom and Ben land in a
text: large GARBAGE TRUCK. The truck rocks back and forth, DENTING
text: from the inside. Grunts, growls.
text: CRASH! The truck suddenly STOPS. COP CARS SPEED CLOSER,
text: sirens screaming. And --
text: BOOM, A HUGE SHAPE explodes from the truck. SMASH! Ben
text: lands on a CAR filled with two OLD LADIES -- his head cracks
text: the WINDSHIELD. Doom steps out of the garbage truck, water
text: flooding the street around him. COP CARS converge on Doom.
text: Doom turns his attention to the cops. His limbs SPARK with
text: electricity, ready to fire at the cars.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Ben sees the cops and Doom. He knows the cops are dead meat.
text: He turns to the OLD LADY in the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Excuse me, Maam. Can I borrow your
dialog: car?
text: She nods and quickly gets out, shaking.
speaker_heading: OLD LADY
text: The clutch sticks a little.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Not gonna be a problem.
text: Ben LIFTS the car and THROWS it at Doom. WHMM! It FLIES
text: through the air, and WHAM! Hits hard, knocking Doom back
text: twenty feet! As Doom FLIES back, a BUS enters frame, and --
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: BOOM! Doom SMASHES into the OUT OF SERVICE BUS! CRASH!
text: Windows shatter. The bus SLAMS into an ELECTRICITY POLE,
text: snapping the pole. Doom steps out, unharmed.
text: Ben CHARGES toward him. Doom grabs the broken ELECTRICITY
text: POLE, FLIPS it into his hand, and wields the pole like a
text: giant STUN-GUN! Electric sparks FLY through the air into --
text: BEN! The BLAST of VOLTS launches him off his feet! He goes
text: FLYING backward, ELECTROCUTED in mid-flight, and --
text: WHOOMPF! Ben LANDS HARD, face down, CRATERING the street!
text: Water rushes into the crater. Ben lays there, incapacitated.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - SAME TIME
text: On the street, cars SCREAM to stops, people GASP. Doom
text: strides up to Ben, and raises the ELECTRICITY POLE for the
text: death-blow. Currents surge. Right before he swings down --
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I can't let you do that.
text: Simple, strong. Doom turns to see...REED. Alone. Bruised
text: and battered. Slowly stepping toward him. Doom smiles.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: And you can't stop me.
text: He turns back to Ben, raises the pole, but...he CAN'T SWING
text: DOWN! Something is HOLDING the pole in mid-air.
text: Something invisible.
speaker_heading: DOOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello Susan.
text: She turns VISIBLE, holding back the pole with a FORCEFIELD.
text: Using her power, she FLINGS the pole from Doom's grip. It
text: skids along the street. Reed helps Ben to his feet.
text: Doom turns to these three wounded soldiers.
speaker_heading: DOOM (CONT'D)
dialog: What is this? The pitiful three?
text: Doom steps toward them, but --
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Four.
text: WHOOOSH! Johnny SWOOPS DOWN, hurling a FIREBALL like a
text: flamethrower, KNOCKING Doom back.
text: Johnny takes his place alongside the others. The four of
text: them stand as one. Johnny turns to Thing.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Had a little relapse, huh?
text: Thing starts to retort, but Johnny gives a warm smile.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Welcome back.
text: They turn to Doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed
text: and melted, making him look all the more menacing.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: This is going to be fun.
text: Electricity starts to course through his body. He stands at
text: the foot of the crater Ben made. He THRUSTS down, grabbing a
text: thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street!
text: He SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips. He
text: holds tight, ABSORBING the power. Lights FLICKER and DIM in
text: buildings around him. Windows BLOW! Doom GLOWS, amped up.
text: He LETS GO of the cables! The two deadly wires SNAKE out of
text: control! PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic. Reed sees the wires
text: SLASHING through the air. He makes a move:
text: Reed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables.
text: Doom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS. The electric charges
text: surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but --
text: Sue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid-
text: flight. She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize
text: fighter. One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field
dialog: and --
text: SMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING! The pillar
text: starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang!
text: They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete! But --
text: Suddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is
text: holding it up! He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas
text: holding the world. People run out, safe.
text: ON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire.
speaker_heading: REED
scene_heading: JOHNNY! SPOT-WELD!
text: Johnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the
text: wires back together. Sparks fly. The cables start to FUSE.
text: Doom keeps FIRING. Sue struggles with her force-fields. The
text: impact is too much. Her nose starts to bleed.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Can't...hold...on...
text: Doom smiles. Reed sees her. She is about to drop her hands,
text: vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY!
text: He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he
text: forms a WALL between Sue and Doom.
text: Doom keeps FIRING his bolts. They SLAM into Reed's body,
text: RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without
text: breaking. He strains, agonizing.
speaker_heading: REED
scene_heading: Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: But all these people...
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Now.
text: Johnny charges toward Doom -- flames on his body starting
text: build to a blinding white intensity, ENGULFING everything.
text: Johnny GRABS DOOM.
speaker_heading: THING
dialog: (quiet, smiling)
dialog: Flame on, kid.
text: FLASH! Johnny explodes in a PULSE of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT,
text: which starts to HEAT UP everything surrounding it. Reed
text: doesn't miss a beat. He's in total command now.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Sue, I need some of that anger, rage,
dialog: frustration --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (looking at Doom)
dialog: I'm sure I can come up with something.
text: She concentrates. She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and
text: the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT.
text: Sue shuts her eyes. A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER
text: BODY. A massive WAVE OF ENERGY. It SWOOPS past a car, which
text: WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field).
text: Thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them.
text: Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it
text: in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY. The light increases, to the
text: point that it's blinding. People look away.
text: Finally, Johnny's supernova fades. He collapses to the
text: ground, exhausted, smoking. Sue exhales and falls to her
text: knees. Her force field fades. The light flickers out. As
text: everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD. THUD. And --
text: DOOM steps through the smoke. Unharmed. His metallic body
text: GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL. Sue, Ben, Johnny look
text: devastated. They can't beat him. He looks at Reed.
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: Is that the best you can do...? A
dialog: little heat...?
text: Reed stays perfectly calm. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101:
dialog: what happens when you supercool hot
dialog: metal...?
dialog: (to Ben)
dialog: Ben...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Got it, teach.
text: He KICKS OPEN the FIRE HYDRANT. The water GEYSERS UP! Ben
text: kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays
text: toward Reed, who...TWISTS HIS TORSO so...
text: The water CURLS around his chest, RACES down his arms, and
text: SHOOTS right off his wrists toward Doom!
speaker_heading: DOOM
dialog: No.
text: Doom RUSHES TOWARD Reed, but the WATER FLIES OUT, DOUSING
text: DOOM. GIANT CLOUDS OF STEAM fill the air from the cooling
text: metal. DOOM screams. His shrieks finally fade to SILENCE.
text: The water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely
text: obscuring Doom from view. A beat. The steam clears to
dialog: reveal:
text: DOOM. A true statue now -- a hard, cold solid piece of
text: METAL. Frozen forever. Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny -- The
text: Fantastic Four -- exhale. They stand as one, in roiling
text: smoke. A beat.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Damn, I love this job.
text: Reed and Sue slowly lock eyes, thinking the same thing.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Job, huh...?
text: Will they accept their mantle? Reed shrugs.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Well, we do have the suits...
text: They give weary smiles. A team. Sue gets close to Reed.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You know, about what we said up there,
dialog: I think maybe --
text: THHM! He KISSES HER. His neck extending. Strong, powerful.
text: He pulls back slightly, smiles at her. A new strength in
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
text: Sue looks at Reed. A long way from that conference room.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Hilarious.
text: As they kiss, people emerge, stepping out of hiding. The sun
text: rises around them. The Fantastic Four step into the new dawn
dialog: of a new day. And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --
scene_heading: INT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - BANQUET ROOM - DUSK
text: Reed and Sue kiss on the deck of the Circle Line as it chugs
dialog: around New York City.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (O.S.)
dialog: Dude, that's still my sister.
text: A PARTY IN PROGRESS. Drinks, food, music. We see in the
text: crowd a familiar faces: O'HOOLIHAN (cast on his arm),
text: bartender ERNIE, others. JOHNNY and BEN stand behind Reed
dialog: and Sue.
text: Reed and Sue pull apart. Reed turns to Ben, excited.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Ben, I've been crunching the numbers
dialog: on the machine. I think if we can
dialog: rework the power settings...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
speaker_heading: ALICIA (O.S.)
dialog: That's my Benny.
text: She hands Ben a big METAL MUG. Ben takes the mug. He
text: CLINKS, but SHATTERS her glass.
speaker_heading: ALICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going to have to work on your
dialog: touch.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I like the sound of that.
text: Alicia gets close. A soft smile. Reed turns to Sue.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Sue, can I talk to you for a second?
text: Reed leads her out. Ben and Johnny swap a glance.
scene_heading: EXT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - DECK - DUSK
text: A romantic view of the city-scape. Reed stands with Sue.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: I found a broken gasket, from space --
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
text: He opens his hand, revealing a circular piece of metal, just
text: about the size of......a RING. Sue slows down.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: If one of us were to wear it...
text: She sees Johnny and Ben inside, watching -- in on a secret.
text: Reed looks her square in the eye. Unflinching.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Reed. What are you doing?
text: Reed drops to his knees. His head stays eye-level, while his
text: body drops. Sue gapes, so emotional she starts to DISAPPEAR.
speaker_heading: REED
dialog: No more thinking, no more variables...
dialog: Sue Storm...will you...
dialog: (she's gone)
dialog: Sue? Sue? You there?
text: Dead silence. And then...
text: THE RING DISAPPEARS. SUE IS WEARING IT.
speaker_heading: SUE (V.O.)
dialog: Yes.
text: Reed goes to kiss her.
speaker_heading: SUE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: That's my nose, genius... These are my
dialog: lips.
text: Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible
text: hands. She pulls him into a KISS and reappears.
text: INSIDE: the party applauds. Ben, Johnny, and Alicia move
text: through the crowd to join Reed and Sue. As they go --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No more cracks about how I look.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.
dialog: (weaving around bodies)
text: Clear the way, wide load coming
dialog: through.
text: Ben glares, fists clenched. Johnny smiles, mischievous, as
text: they hit the balcony. And he FLAMES ON, taking off into the
text: air, blazing the NUMBER "FOUR" enclosed in a circle of flame
text: (their future callsign), over the city skyline. The crowd
text: oohs and aahs. Ben watches, unimpressed.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Showoff.
text: People drink, laugh, dance. We slowly PULL BACK from the
dialog: party, the boat, the city, and...CUT TO --
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR - DAY
text: CLOSE ON: the MELTED FACE of DOOM. He is placed in a wooden
text: crate. LEONARD oversees the operation, listening to his
dialog: cell.
text: As two workers move the heavy door in place -- a crackle of
text: ELECTRICITY moves over Doom's body. Leonard's CELLPHONE goes
text: STATICKY. His eyes narrow. Could it be...? And --
text: SLAM. The door closes. We can read the destination through
text: stenciled lettering: LATVERIA. And we pull back to reveal
text: the box is on the deck of:
text: A FREIGHTER SHIP. The ship pulls away, steaming into the
dialog: horizon, as we...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
