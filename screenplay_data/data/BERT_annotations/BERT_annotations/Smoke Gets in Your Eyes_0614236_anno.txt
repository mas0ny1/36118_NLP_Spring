scene_heading: INT. KNICK KNACK BAR 4
text: Vinyl upholstery and mirrored walls, but brand new. It's
text: after work, but the women have their hair done and each man's
text: tie is pushed to the top of his collar. Highballs and
text: martinis clink under quiet music and everywhere are the
text: sights and sounds of smoking.
text: Alone in a red corner booth is DON DRAPER, early 30's,
text: handsome, conservative, and despite his third old fashioned,
text: he is apparently sober. He is doodling on a cocktail napkin.
text: He crosses something out, puts down his fountain pen, and
text: taps a cigarette out of a pack of "Lucky Strike".
text: The BUSBOY, a middle-aged black man, too old for his tight
text: uniform, approaches.
speaker_heading: BUSBOY
dialog: Finished, sir?
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Yeah. Got a light?

speaker_heading: DON (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I ask you something? Why do
dialog: you smoke 'Old Gold'?
text: The busboy seems flustered and looks around nervously. The
text: burly white BARTENDER approaches.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I'm sorry sir. Is Sam here
dialog: bothering you? He can be a little
dialog: chatty.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: No, we're actually having a
dialog: conversation. Is that okay?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: (thinking)

speaker_heading: DON
dialog: (points to drink)
dialog: Do this again. Old Fashioned,

speaker_heading: DON (CONT'D)
dialog: So, obviously you need to relax

speaker_heading: BUSBOY

speaker_heading: DON
dialog: What is it, low-tar? Low-nicotine?
dialog: Those new filters? I mean, why

speaker_heading: BUSBOY

speaker_heading: BUSBOY
dialog: I love my Old Gold.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Let's just say tomorrow a tobacco
dialog: weevil comes and eats every last
dialog: Old Gold on the planet.
speaker_heading: BUSBOY
dialog: That's a sad story.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Yes, it's a tragedy. Would you
dialog: just stop smoking?
speaker_heading: BUSBOY
dialog: I'm pretty sure I'd find something.
dialog: I love smoking.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: (writing as he speaks)
dialog: "I love smoking". That's very
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: BUSBOY
dialog: My wife hates it. "The Reader's

speaker_heading: DON

scene_heading: INT. MIDGE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 6
text: The apartment has a huge glass view of Manhattan and is

text: on a platform.
text: Midge walks to her drafting table where she is working. Don
text: sits on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: MIDGE
dialog: Well, you're lucky I'm still up
dialog: working. And that I'm alone.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: How's it going?
speaker_heading: MIDGE
dialog: They invented something called

speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Can I run a few ideas past you?

speaker_heading: MIDGE

dialog: This is the same scare you had five
dialog: years ago. You dealt with it. I

speaker_heading: DON
dialog: But that's the problem. The whole

dialog: No more doctors, no more
text: testimonials, no more cough-free,
dialog: soothes your t-zone, low-tar, low-
text: nicotine, filter-tipped, nothing.
text: It's over. All that's left is a
dialog: crush-proof box and "Four Out of
dialog: Five Dead People Smoked Your
dialog: Brand."
text: Don drains his drink. Midge puts on a record. She sits
text: behind him on the bed, starts rubbing his neck.
speaker_heading: MIDGE
dialog: Is this the part where I say, "Don
dialog: Draper is the greatest ad-man ever
dialog: and his big strong brain will find

dialog: No, I really don't know what they

text: He holds it up for Pete.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: (still on phone)

dialog: Only one, but I got up very early.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: In a couple of years, with the
dialog: right moves, you'll be in the city

dialog: I don't know what your goals are,

dialog: perfume. Keep a fifth of something
dialog: in your desk. Mr. Draper drinks
dialog: rye. Also, invest in some aspirin,
text: some band-aids, and a needle and
dialog: thread.
text: Peggy whips out a steno-pad and starts writing.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Rye is Canadian, right?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You better find out. He may act
dialog: like he wants a secretary, but most
dialog: of the time they're looking for
dialog: something between a mother and a

dialog: well --
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: Go home, take a paper bag, cut
