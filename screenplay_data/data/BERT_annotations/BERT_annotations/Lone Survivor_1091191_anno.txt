text: Danny’s already on scope. Gun aimed at the approaching kid
dialog: when...
text: Two more Afghan MEN crest the hill - an old man and a
dialog: teenager.
text: The hill is full of goats. More than a hundred with the three

text: The goat bells and baying of the animals creating serious

text: Weapons coming up as they silently take in this bizarre
dialog: situation.
text: Back to Marcus as the first goat passes by. Then another.
text: Tight on lead Afghan boy...THE GOAT BOY.
text: He’s heading dangerously close to Luttrell’s hide singing

speaker_heading: AXE
dialog: Then what?
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: I’m just saying. It ain’t gonna be

speaker_heading: AXE

dialog: What we have to do. That’s it.
dialog: That’s our business.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What’s two?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Two is, this is the Navy and you’re

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: LUTTRELL

dialog: No. I'd rather fight them straight

dialog: We don’t know how many Hajji’s they

speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: So now you have an opinion? I
dialog: thought you were standing by
dialog: waiting for your orders?
speaker_heading: AXE
dialog: This opp is a soup sandwich. Been
dialog: so from the beginning. The pitch.
dialog: The rope. Worst comms that I’ve

speaker_heading: LUTTRELL

speaker_heading: AXE
dialog: Shah just killed twenty marines
dialog: last week and we’re on him. We’ve

dialog: let them go.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: I don’t see it that way.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: So what is your fucking call bro?
speaker_heading: LUTTRELL
dialog: Let them go. Shut it down.
dialog: So if Murphy was taking a vote it seems like it’s one vote
text: for killing them, one vote for letting them go, Danny is
dialog: neutral.
text: This is all on MURPHY.
text: Murphy turns away from them, looking down the steep pitched

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Here’s what we’re gonna do. Pack
dialog: up. Everything. We’re gonna let ‘em

speaker_heading: SEALS POV

speaker_heading: LUTTRELL

dialog: Hold.
speaker_heading: THEN.
text: Luttrell fires once. Blowing the man’s head off.
text: An odd brief moment of silence as the head shot Afghan

text: Stops.
text: Luttrell shoots again removes what's left of the fighter’s
dialog: head.

text: BREAKS LOOSE.
text: From above and half way down both flanks the Taliban open
dialog: fire.
text: Screaming at each other, communicating through violent, loud

speaker_heading: TALIBAN POV:
text: From behind at least 12 Tabliban fighters pushing deeper into

text: Two more Taliban hit. The remaining start taking solid

text: Axe being the closest takes the majority of the firepower.
text: Decent cover from a granite boulder which is getting hacked
text: to pieces by the incoming AK fire.
text: Razor sharp stone shrapnel chunks slicing into Axe’s face and
text: neck. Blood runs down his face drips off his chin.

text: tearing down through his shoulder and burning deep inside his
dialog: chest.
text: Axe keeps firing, hitting a Taliban in the knee. The Taliban
text: fires back at Axe missing but sending sharp rock chips
text: shearing up off the granite into Axe’s face. Shredding his
text: right ear, cutting into his eyeballs.
text: Half blind. Watery out of focus images as sweat mixed with
text: blood. Axe struggles to see. When his vision clears up enough
dialog: to focus:
speaker_heading: AXE POV.
text: Two Tali fighters. Moving fast out of cover, right at AXE.
text: Directly at the Americans. SEAL style. Attacking the counter

text: The Taliban are close to the half blind Axe. Axe fires blind.
text: Misses. The Taliban almost on him. Then:
