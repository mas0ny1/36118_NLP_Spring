scene_heading: ON BRIGHT, OUT-OF-FOCUS, OVAL-SHAPED COLORS.
dialog: 
text: The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression
text: of looking through a kaleidoscope.
dialog: 
text: As the image comes into sharp focus, we discover that we are
text: inside a CANDY BOWL. A MAN'S FINGERS are frantically
text: removing all the cherry-flavored pieces of candy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: The man performing this curious task is
dialog: writer/producer/director, VIKTOR TARANSKY, forties,
text: conservatively dressed in suit and tie. He sits alone at an
text: empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage,
text: some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows
text: the table's paper cloth.
dialog: 
text: Viktor finishes sorting. Finding no trash can to deposit the
text: rejected cherry candy, he scoops them into his pocket.
dialog: 
text: A young headset-clad P.A. hurriedly approaches. He looks
dialog: ill.
dialog: 
dialog: P.A.
dialog: Mr. Taransky --
dialog: 
text: Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: She's walking?... Don't tell me
text: she's walking.
dialog: (blood slowly draining
dialog: from his face)
dialog: She is not walking... She can't
dialog: walk.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: NICOLA ANDERS, twenty-something, A-list actress, beautiful
text: face scowling, is supervising her ASSISTANT ferrying clothes
text: from a movie trailer to a limousine. VIKTOR desperately
text: follows after Nicola.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- Nicola! How was your massage?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: You're in breach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- Is this about the new pages? --
dialog: I made the changes you wanted,
dialog: you're in virtually every scene --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: (wheeling on him)
dialog: It's not the size of the role,
dialog: Viktor.
dialog: (suddenly very cool)
dialog: Am I or am I not contractually
dialog: entitled to the biggest trailer on
dialog: the set?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (regarding the enormous
dialog: silver fish behind them,
dialog: confused)
dialog: It's the biggest on earth! I
dialog: swear! It's a 50-foot Airstream --
dialog: they don't make them any longer
dialog: than that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: Taller, Viktor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Taller? What?
dialog: 
text: Viktor looks up in horror. The trailer next to Nicola's does
text: indeed appear to be fractionally taller.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: You've insulted me for the last
dialog: time.
dialog: 
text: Viktor looks to the tires. His face suddenly brightens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Nicola, it's just the tires --
dialog: they're over-inflated! I can fix
dialog: it!
dialog: 
text: Viktor grasps the air nozzle on a tire and begins desperately
text: stabbing at it with a ballpoint pen. Air hisses out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: See, it's lower already.
dialog: 
text: Nicola ignores Viktor, marching towards her limo with her
text: PUBLICIST. Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I beg you. You can't do this to
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: (looking back)
dialog: I had three other offers. I only
dialog: signed on to this picture out of...
dialog: loyalty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Then show some. They'll shut me
dialog: down!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: (opening the car door)
dialog: It wasn't working anyhow. The
dialog: scene with the thousand geese -- I
dialog: don't understand this film. I
dialog: don't think anyone will understand
dialog: it. I already put out a press
dialog: release -- citing "creative
dialog: differences".
dialog: 
text: Viktor stops, nods resignedly -- suddenly very calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You know what, Nicola, you're
dialog: right.
dialog: (picking up her last piece
dialog: of luggage)
dialog: Here, let me help you with that.
dialog: (holding the door for her)
dialog: You ought to go. The truth is I
dialog: don't deserve you. This film
dialog: doesn't deserve you. Frankly, it
dialog: deserves much, much better. The
dialog: reason it's not working is because
dialog: you're not about the work.
dialog: 
text: Nicola is stunned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (to the limo driver)
dialog: To Hell, please.
dialog: 
text: The door slams and the limo roars away. Viktor looks to the
text: still hissing trailer tire. The CREW regards Viktor
text: apprehensively.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (to the crew)
dialog: What are you looking at? Get back
dialog: to work.
dialog: 
dialog: The crew is uncertain what work there is to do.

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT

text: In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I'm here. I'm right beside you.
dialog: 
text: A NUN enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: (to Hal)
dialog: You should really go now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: No, it's alright. Please, let him
dialog: stay.
dialog: 
text: The nun withdraws. Hal holds his face in his hands, almost
dialog: breaking down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (a glance to heaven)
dialog: What kind of cruel God is it that
dialog: would take you away from me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: The same one who brought me to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: No... I cannot accept it. If
dialog: something like this can happen.
dialog: What...
dialog: (struggling to find the
dialog: words)
dialog: What is it for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: (smiles through her pain)
dialog: -- Why are we here? Is that what
dialog: you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
dialog: here? No why. Just here.

scene_heading: INT. SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR sits with leading man HAL, THREE EXECUTIVES and studio

text: It ends with a close up of NICOLA ANDERS.
dialog: 
text: The lights go up. The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 1
dialog: She's good. You can hardly tell
text: she's reading off a teleprompter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: I've analyzed the footage. We've
dialog: got almost everything we need in
dialog: the can. If we rework the script,
dialog: we can finish the film without her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 2
dialog: (forceful shake of the
dialog: head)
dialog: According to the writ her attorneys
dialog: filed at noon today. They'll sue
dialog: if the film is released with Nicola
text: in a single frame.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (more anxious)
dialog: So we'll re-cast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Nicola Anders is the only actress
dialog: who can play that role.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: It's a re-make, Hal. Anders is not
dialog: bigger than this picture.
dialog: 
text: Elaine finally speaks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Of course she is. No other name is
dialog: going to sign on now and risk
dialog: offending her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: We don't need a name. We'll cast
dialog: an unknown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I won't play opposite an unknown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: We can't sell an unknown. Nicola's
dialog: soured on the project and we have
dialog: to accept that. If we ever want to
dialog: be in the Nicola Anders business
dialog: again, we have to cut our losses
dialog: and shelve the picture.
dialog: 
text: The executives, leading man and director nod sagely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: No! You will not give in to that
dialog: blackmailing bitch!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (a wince, addressing
dialog: everyone but Viktor)
dialog: Excuse us.

dialog: 
text: ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous
text: soundstage. They speak more freely in each other's company.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: God, Viktor. Why do you always
dialog: have to make things so difficult
dialog: for yourself?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Difficult. I'm difficult.
dialog: 
text: He produces a handful of candy from his pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (referring to the candy)
dialog: -- Do you know what these are,
dialog: Elaine?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (talking a piece of candy
dialog: and eating it)
dialog: Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Not just any Mike &amp; Ike's -- cherry
dialog: Mike &amp; Ike's. Do you know why I,
dialog: Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy
dialog: Award nominated director --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- overseeing the most cherished
dialog: movie project of my career, am
text: walking around with a pocketful of
dialog: cherry Mike &amp; Ike's?
dialog: 
text: Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor paces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: -- I have a feeling you're going to
dialog: tell me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- I'll tell you why. It is
dialog: because Miss Nicola Anders,
dialog: supermodel with a SAG card God's
dialog: gift to cinema, has it written into
dialog: her contract that all cherry Mike &amp;
dialog: Ike's be removed from her candy
dialog: dish along with strict instructions
dialog: that any room she walks into should
dialog: have seven packs of cigarettes
dialog: waiting for her three of them
dialog: opened, that there be a personal
dialog: jacuzzi within eighty paces of her
dialog: dressing room, and that any time
dialog: she travels, her nanny must fly
dialog: with her first class.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: -- What's wrong with that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Elaine, she doesn't have any
dialog: children!
dialog: (grabbing her arm)
dialog: Don't you see? We're being held
dialog: hostage by 12 men and 5 women who
dialog: someone somewhere has decreed are
dialog: the A-list.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: The public decides who's on that
dialog: list.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: It's the truth. Those 17
dialog: superstars are our insurance
dialog: policy. We can't open -- can't
dialog: make a profit without them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: We can hardly make a profit with
dialog: them. Up-front salary, back-end
dialog: deal, perks, per diem, percentages
dialog: -- They're mocking us, Elaine.
dialog: We're at their mercy.
dialog: (staring wistful, into
dialog: space)
dialog: We always had movie stars but they
dialog: used to be our stars. We used to
dialog: decide who would play what role.
dialog: We told them what to wear, what to
dialog: say, who to date. When they were
dialog: under contract, we could change
dialog: their names if we wanted to -- more
dialog: than once!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (regarding him as if he's
dialog: insane)
dialog: You realize you're nostalgic for an
dialog: era you weren't even born in?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (irritated at her
dialog: infuriating logic)
dialog: Well, I do remember why I started
dialog: out in this business -- you seem to
dialog: have forgotten -- working in New
dialog: York with Cassevetes -- we were
dialog: trying to do something important,
dialog: shine a light in that darkened
dialog: cinema --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (rolling her eyes)
dialog: -- It's called a projector.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: -- Illuminate hearts and minds with
dialog: a ray of truth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Listen, Viktor, I have good
dialog: memories of those days too -- but
dialog: this isn't about that or you or me
dialog: or some high-minded ideal. This is
dialog: business.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Spare me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (gesturing at the studio
dialog: lot)
dialog: -- Christ, Viktor, look around.
dialog: What do you think pays for all
dialog: this? This is about investment and
dialog: return. Those days in New York...
dialog: that's... it's over.
dialog: 
text: A pause. Viktor reads Elaine's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You're not renewing my contract.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: How can I? Your last three
text: pictures tanked. The board is
dialog: giving me hell. No bankable star
dialog: will work with you after this. If
dialog: you just compromised... a little.
dialog: 
text: Viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the
dialog: news.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (rueful smile)
dialog: -- Well, it's not every day you're
dialog: fired by the mother of your own
dialog: child.
dialog: 
text: Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate
dialog: moment between them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (softening, a heart-to
dialog: heart)
dialog: I'm not taking away your daughter,
dialog: just your deal. You and I both
dialog: know, after the divorce I kept you
dialog: on for old time's sake, so you
dialog: could still hold your head up in
dialog: front of Lainey. I called what's
dialog: his name at Warner's. He said he'd
dialog: take a meeting -- in July. I've
dialog: fought for you Viktor...
dialog: (voice trails off)
dialog: You want to talk severance?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (staring off into the
dialog: distance, face hardening)
dialog: You can have everything -- office,
dialog: car, assistants -- all I want is
dialog: the picture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: The picture's dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: So there's no problem -- I can have
dialog: the rights, the negative too?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (believing she's getting
dialog: off lightly)
dialog: They're yours. But how are you
dialog: going to finish it? Without a star
dialog: there's no movie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I don't need a star. All I need is
dialog: an actor -- I'll reshoot the part,
dialog: cut out Nicola and replace her with
dialog: a real actor. A real leading lady.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Even if you find her, you know the
dialog: problem with unknowns, Viktor. If
dialog: they're good, they get known. And
dialog: then you're back to sorting their
dialog: candy... and worse.
text: (kissing him on the cheek
text: as she departs in her
dialog: studio golf cart)
dialog: I'm sorry, Viktor.
dialog: 
text: Viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left
text: alone on the deserted lot.

scene_heading: EXT. STUDIO ENTRANCE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Twenty NICOLA ANDERS' FACES jiggle into frame. VIKTOR's face
text: appears amongst them.
dialog: 
text: They are cardboard figures, standing together in the trailer
text: of an electric cart. A WORKMAN is collecting the promotional
text: standees from around the lot.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out --
text: we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen

dialog: computer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: Hi, Dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (slightly ashamed)
dialog: Hello, sweetheart.

speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: I'm sorry Mom canned you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: It's really... not anything,
dialog: Lainey. It's just --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: Don't feel too bad.
dialog: (glancing to a standee)
dialog: Mom runs the place and they still
dialog: walk all over her. You're better
dialog: off out of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (regarding his daughter)
dialog: You look very grown up. What are
dialog: you doing? You meeting your mom
dialog: for dinner?
dialog: 
text: She glances towards the entrance where Lainey's mother,
text: ELAINE, and her dependable, uncomplicated businessman
text: boyfriend, KENT, wait beside Elaine's car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: (reluctant admission)
dialog: Kent got tickets to the ballet.

text: Viktor shakes the idea of Kent and Elaine from his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (trying to convince
dialog: himself as much as
dialog: Lainey)
dialog: I'm going to finish the picture,
dialog: sweetheart. It's important.

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (at the car window)
dialog: I won't be here next week. The
dialog: tumor's inoperable. I'll be dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (winding down the window)
dialog: I'm already dead.
dialog: 
text: Viktor's car roars away. He looks back at the forlorn Hank
text: in the rear view mirror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Call me.
dialog: (looking at his watch)
dialog: This week!
dialog: 
text: A huge eye from a dismantled Nicola Anders billboard is
text: wheeled away behind him -- followed by a huge pair of lips.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: A sea of ingenue headshots. Black X's are drawn through all
text: of them. VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on
text: the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (into phone, referring to
text: a young woman's headshot)
dialog: -- What do you mean she won't work
dialog: with me? She's done nothing. She
dialog: doesn't have a single credit --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT'S VOICE
dialog: (from phone, off-camera)
dialog: -- Better no credits than a
dialog: Taransky credit. No young actress
dialog: is going to step into Nicola
dialog: Anders' shoes and risk ending her
dialog: career before it's even started.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- Art, you don't understand. I've
dialog: mortgaged everything to finish this
dialog: film -- creditors calling, coming
dialog: to the house, for God's sake, I
dialog: need this --
dialog: 
text: The phone goes dead. Viktor tries to re-dial --
dialog: disconnected.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- Damn.
dialog: 
text: Sharp knock on his door. Viktor peers through a curtain and
text: spies an official-looking MAN IN A SUIT, carrying what looks
text: to be a legal notice in his hands.
dialog: 
text: Viktor slips out of the back door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR hurries along the beach. When he turns, he discovers
text: the MAN IN THE SUIT following him. As Viktor runs, the Suit
text: runs -- calling out to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN IN THE SUIT
dialog: Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (calling back)
dialog: I'm not him.
dialog: 
text: Viktor stumbles. When he recovers, the Suit is on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN IN THE SUIT
dialog: Mr. Taransky, Sir, I represent the
dialog: estate of Mr. Hank Aleno.
dialog: (showing him Hank's
dialog: obituary in the L.A.
dialog: Times)
dialog: It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that
dialog: you have this.
dialog: 
text: The Suit hands Viktor a heavily-sealed envelope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN IN THE SUIT
dialog: I have no idea, Sir. He wanted you
dialog: to have it.
dialog: 
text: The Suit departs. Viktor hesitates, then breaks the seal on
text: the package -- inside he finds a hard-drive. The hard-drive
dialog: is labeled "SIMULATION ONE".
dialog: 
text: A TITLE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIX MONTHS LATER
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP ON
dialog: 
text: a VACUUM CLEANER cleaning a tatty red carpet.
dialog: 
text: On the other end of the vacuum cleaner is VIKTOR. The red
text: carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the
dialog: venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET". To save money
dialog: on posters, Viktor has altered the originals, "Starring
text: NICOLA ANDERS" crudely pasted over with "Introducing SIMONE".
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - DUSK
dialog: 
dialog: VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere. No paparazzi, no
text: limos, no klieg lights. Resorting to giving away tickets to
text: PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in
dialog: trash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Want to see a free movie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: (he thinks)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: A taxi pulls up. Viktor's daughter, LAINEY, steps out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: (kissing him hello)
dialog: Hi, Dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Hello, Lainey.
dialog: 
text: Viktor goes to pay for the taxi but doesn't have quite enough
text: cash. Lainey pays herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Your mother couldn't make it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: She's at the premiere of "A Cold
dialog: Day In Hell". But I think she send
dialog: someone from Acquisitions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: She still with Kent?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: This week anyhow.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR escorts Lainey down the empty red carpet, regarding
text: the pathetic premiere. As they walk by, the bulb in Viktor's
text: sole spotlight expires.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Not quite how I imagined it --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: (looking on the bright
dialog: side)
dialog: -- You finished the film on your
dialog: own terms, that's what matters.
dialog: Did you really do all the post
dialog: yourself?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: There was no other way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: I missed you. I wondered if you
dialog: were ever coming back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Me too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: (regarding the makeshift
dialog: poster, trying to lift
dialog: his spirits)
dialog: Well, I can't wait to meet
dialog: Simone... what's her last name?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You know, I... don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: Is she here tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: She can't watch herself.
dialog: 
text: They are interrupted by the THEATER OWNER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THEATER OWNER
dialog: -- Hey, we have to start. I've got
dialog: "Tough Love 2" playing at ten.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PIER - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - MORNING
dialog: 
text: A foggy, empty pier. A MAN is running through the mist,
dialog: shouting desperately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Valarie! VALARIE!
dialog: 
text: Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and
text: hood, her back to us. The camera pushes in, music swells and
text: she turns. SIMONE. She is exquisitely, ethereally
dialog: beautiful. Perfect.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RUNDOWN DOWNTOWN CINEMA - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is
text: playing ON THE SCREEN.
dialog: 
text: When Simone's face appears, the faces of the AUDIENCE MEMBERS
text: change. They are all visibly moved, including the THEATER
text: OWNER. Some weeping, some with curious smiles on their
text: faces, some opened-mouthed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (ON SCREEN, approaching)
dialog: Valarie, what are you running from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: (enigmatic smile)
dialog: From Valarie.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out. Simone collapses to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (running to her)
dialog: Valarie! No!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking
text: while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth. Viktor finally
text: musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - "SUNRISE, SUNSET" - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The same scene that played in the studio screening room.
dialog: However now when we cut from the leading man, HAL, to the
text: leading lady it is not NICOLA but the newly cast SIMONE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: -- Why are we here? Is that what
dialog: you're asking, Jack?... Why are we
dialog: here? No why. Just here.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying. Now even LAINEY is affected by
text: Simone's performance. She wipes a tear from her eye.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR watches the backs of the heads, trying to gauge the
text: audience reaction. Finally the credits roll.
dialog: 
dialog: A dedication, "For HANK".
dialog: 
text: No one moves from their seats. Viktor permits himself a
text: brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the
dialog: credits:
dialog: 
scene_heading: A Film By VIKTOR TARANSKY
dialog: 
text: Still no one moves from their seats. Viktor cannot stand it
text: any longer. He runs to the restroom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THEATER RESTROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Face over the stained sink, VIKTOR splashes himself with
text: water. He looks to the mirror, horrified by his own
text: reflection. He rehearses a courtroom speech.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I
dialog: may be guilty of a crime, but it
dialog: was committed with the purest of
dialog: intentions, to send a message to
dialog: the acting community who put
dialog: themselves above the work and
dialog: above --
dialog: 
text: Three AUDIENCE MEMBERS enter the restroom. They approach the
dialog: urinals.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
dialog: (continuing their
dialog: conversation from the
dialog: lobby)
dialog: -- So fake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
dialog: -- Totally artificial.
dialog: 
text: Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing
text: the end of their conversation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
dialog: We're really supposed to believe
dialog: that was 19th Century Lisbon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER 3
dialog: Who's looking at the sets when she
dialog: is on the screen?
dialog: 
text: All three nod in agreement and begin to urinate.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR exits the restroom. Almost all the AUDIENCE MEMBERS,
text: including LAINEY, are waiting for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: (pointing out her father)
dialog: There he is. That's my dad, Viktor
dialog: Taransky.
dialog: 
text: Viktor is about to run for the exit when the small group
text: spontaneously applauds. They rush to shake his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER 4
dialog: -- She is magnificent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER 5
dialog: -- Absolutely unreal.
dialog: 
text: Viktor appears uncomfortable with their compliments.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: She wasn't too... cartoony?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER 6
dialog: -- Who? The nun?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER 7
dialog: -- Or are you talking about the
dialog: mother?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER 8
dialog: -- A star like that, who cares
dialog: about the supporting cast?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER 9
dialog: -- Congratulations again. She
dialog: was... not of this earth. You
dialog: should be very proud.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: "Not of this earth". A good way of
dialog: putting it. And the film as a
dialog: whole -- ?
dialog: 
text: The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: She's a miracle, Dad. Where did
dialog: you find her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (vague)
dialog: I saw her picture on the, er...
dialog: internet.
dialog: (interrogating his
dialog: daughter's face)
dialog: You really didn't notice anything --
dialog: unusual?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: Only her brilliance. To be honest,
dialog: with what you had to work with, I
dialog: was expecting a train wreck. You
dialog: really pulled it off.
dialog: 
text: Lainey regards the makeshift poster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: I have a feeling mom is going to
dialog: take you back after this.
dialog: 
text: Viktor's head snaps around. Lainey smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
text: Back on the lot.
dialog: 
text: Viktor shrugs off the misunderstanding.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR TARANSKY'S MALIBU HOME - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR enters his sterile, bachelor home, carrying his mail.
text: His answering machine blinks in the darkness, the message
text: light reads "FULL". He hits the "PLAY" button.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE (V.O.)
dialog: Viktor, you bastard! I hear it's
dialog: great.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Seriously, I'm happy for you.
dialog: 
text: Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine
text: from happier times. He gazes at it as he listens to the
dialog: message.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE (V.O.)
dialog: I know people are going to be
dialog: beating down your door but... well,
dialog: I'd love the chance to buy back
dialog: something I gave away for free.
dialog: Don't you just love Hollywood?...
speaker_heading: BEEP.
dialog: 
text: Viktor stops the machine, dazed. He idly opens his mail.
text: Inside an envelope he finds a SAG Card with the new member's
dialog: name, "SIMONE".
dialog: 
text: A MONTAGE OF SCENES BEGINS TO PLAY.
dialog: 
text: A) A line of AUDIENCE MEMBERS stretches outside the rundown
text: movie theater as far as the eye can see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
text: A dazzling new ingenue has come
dialog: from seemingly nowhere to capture
dialog: the hearts of movie-going audiences
dialog: across the nation...
dialog: 
text: B) THE FRONT PAGE OF "VARIETY" coming off the presses reads,
dialog: "SIMONE: A REVELATION -- Dawning Of A New Star In
dialog: "SUNRISE".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
dialog: ... in her debut film, "Sunrise,

dialog: 
text: C) A TEENAGE BOY in a public library logs on to the first
text: website dedicated to SIMONE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
text: Her face is already posted on
dialog: everything from websites to bedroom
dialog: walls.
dialog: 
text: D) Trendy TEENAGE GIRLS saunter past a swimming pool in
text: Simone capes and hoods despite the sweltering heat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
dialog: Her wardrobe has inspired a fashion
dialog: craze.
dialog: 
text: E) In a Third World back-alley a YOUNG ASIAN MAN shows an
text: UNDERCOVER REPORTER a pirated recording of SIMONE on a
dialog: camcorder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER (O.S.)
dialog: And bootleg copies of her film are
dialog: being sold in back alleys all over
dialog: the world.
dialog: 
text: F) A LIQUOR STORE CUSTOMER watches a TV behind the counter
text: showing a clip of SIMONE from, "SUNRISE, SUNSET Courtesy:
dialog: Taransky Productions".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
dialog: (from TV)
dialog: But who is Simone? We know so
dialog: little about her. No details of
dialog: her background have been released,
text: not even her age. She is somewhere
text: between a girl and a woman. A
text: fresh face and familiar both at the
dialog: same time.
dialog: 
text: G) The ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER now stands outside a
text: multiplex. The marquee has 16 screens and looks like
dialog: this:

dialog: Is Simone even her real name? And

dialog: little-known director, Viktor
dialog: Tarinsky.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR, watching "SCENE" on a TV in the back of a limousine,
dialog: corrects the reporter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Taransky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
dialog: (from the TV)
dialog: He has parlayed his relationship
dialog: with the new sensation into a three
dialog: picture deal with the very studio
dialog: that dumped him only six months
dialog: ago. And no wonder with the
dialog: starlet's performance breaking all
dialog: box office records.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STUDIO GATE - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS,
text: PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a
text: glimpse of SIMONE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOB
dialog: Simone! SIMONE! I LOVE YOU! I
dialog: Want to BE you!
dialog: 
text: Studio SECURITY GUARDS hold them back as the limo enters the
dialog: lot.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STUDIO - ENTRANCE - DAY
dialog: 
text: ELAINE and an entourage of EXECUTIVES greets VIKTOR's
text: limousine on the studio steps.
dialog: 
text: A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready. A banner
text: reads, "Welcome SIMONE". A YOUNG ASSISTANT wheels a cake.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR steps out of the car. ELAINE pushes past him, into
dialog: the limo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Simone!... Simone?
dialog: 
text: The car is empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (re-emerging from the car)
dialog: Where is she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Good to see you too, Elaine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (ignoring his sarcasm)
dialog: Why isn't she with you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Why? Because she would never show
dialog: up at something like this. She's
dialog: intensely private.
dialog: 
text: Elaine sighs, exasperated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (dismissing her
dialog: colleagues)
dialog: Back to work, everyone. She's not
dialog: here.
dialog: 
text: The reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Viktor... I want to thank you for
dialog: convincing Simone to sign with the
dialog: studio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Don't thank me. It was entirely
dialog: Simone's decision. Do you have
dialog: Simone's check?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I don't have it on me. Anyway, it
dialog: means a lot.
dialog: (quickly changing tack)
dialog: Have you read the reviews? They're
dialog: love letters.
dialog: (reading from a newspaper)
dialog: Listen to this one. "Simone has
text: the voice of a young Jane Fonda,
dialog: the body of Sophia Loren, the grace
dialog: of, well, Grace Kelley, and the
dialog: face of Audrey Hepburn combined
dialog: with an angel".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (musing to himself)
dialog: Almost right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I can't wait to meet her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I don't know if that's going to
dialog: happen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: As I say, she's... something of a
dialog: recluse. That's how she's able to
dialog: stay so pure -- by isolating
dialog: herself in her art.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (face falling)
dialog: Don't be ridiculous. I arranged a
dialog: press conference.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Out of the question. A circus like
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Viktor, it's my studio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: She's my actor. There are other
dialog: studios, Elaine. There's only one
dialog: Simone.
dialog: (leaving her on the steps)
dialog: Leave the press conference to me.
dialog: 
text: Viktor strides up the studio steps. Elaine stares after her
text: ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound
dialog: arrogance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STUDIO - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The studio soundstages as a backdrop, VIKTOR approaches a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (tapping the microphone)
dialog: Is this on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER 1
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Taransky, Viktor. T-a-r-a-n-s-k-y,
dialog: V-i-k-t-o-r.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER 1
dialog: Yeah, but -- who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (patronizing smile)
dialog: I am a two-time Academy Award
dialog: nominated director with over
dialog: eighteen films to my credit thus
dialog: far including my latest release,
dialog: "Sunrise, Sunset". Who are you?
dialog: 
text: A REPORTER rolls her eyes at his pomposity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I will not be taking any questions.
dialog: However I do have a statement to
dialog: read on behalf of my leading lady,
dialog: Simone.
dialog: (reading from his
dialog: statement)
dialog: "To Whom It May Concern. I'm
dialog: deeply grateful for the
dialog: extraordinary public response to
dialog: Mr. Taransky's film. At this time
dialog: I will be conducting no interviews
dialog: or making publicity appearances
dialog: since I am really nothing without
dialog: the beautiful worlds and characters
dialog: Mr. Taransky creates for me. I
dialog: politely request that the press
dialog: respect my privacy and let the work
dialog: speak for itself. All questions
dialog: and inquiries should be directed to
dialog: Mr. Taransky to whom I entrust all
dialog: aspects of my career. Yours very
dialog: truly, Simone".
dialog: 
text: The reporters all call out at once.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER 2
dialog: -- Viktor, Viktor, who's Simone
dialog: dating?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER 3
dialog: -- Viktor, where'd you find her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER 4
dialog: -- Is Simone her real name?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER 5
dialog: -- What's she got to hide?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER 1
dialog: -- Is she the new Garbo?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER 2
dialog: -- Who's Garbo?
dialog: 
text: Viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his
dialog: hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I thought I made it clear -- no
dialog: questions regarding Simone.
dialog: (bringing the press
dialog: conference to a hasty
dialog: conclusion)
dialog: Now, I would like to close by
dialog: announcing that Miss Simone begins
dialog: production today on her next film,
dialog: "Eternity Forever". This project
dialog: has been near and dear to my heart
dialog: since I wrote it nine years ago.
dialog: (a tinge of bitterness,
dialog: then a smile)
dialog: I Thank you.
dialog: 
text: Viktor exits the podium. A voice stops him in his tracks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Who do you think you're fooling,
dialog: Taransky?
dialog: 
text: Viktor turns. The voice belongs to over-zealous, crusading,
text: truth-seeking investigative reporter, MAX SAYER, accompanied
dialog: by his assistant, MILTON.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Do I know you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Max Sayer -- National Echo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (regaining his composure,
dialog: a smirk)
dialog: Don't you have a real story to
dialog: write? Why aren't you in Latin
dialog: America?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: This is the story.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I remember when the Echo had class
dialog: -- the paper that could bring down
dialog: governments.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Our leaders aren't presidents
dialog: anymore -- they're pop stars and
dialog: screen idols. If Woodward and
dialog: Bernstein were alive today, they'd
dialog: be right here in Hollywood with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: They are alive, Sayer.
dialog: 
text: Milton confirms that Woodward and Bernstein are still living.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: So they're probably here.
dialog: (hardly missing a beat)
dialog: You might be able to sell this
dialog: 'disappearing act' to the rest of
dialog: the world, but I'm not buying it.
dialog: What's really behind this Simone
dialog: woman? The public has a right to
dialog: know. Why is she staying out of
dialog: sight? And why the hell is she
dialog: with you? I don't want you to take
dialog: this the wrong way, Viktor, but
dialog: you're not exactly Cecil B.
dialog: DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Maybe the reason she's with me is a
dialog: little thing called integrity,
dialog: Sayer. Look it up.
dialog: 
text: Viktor walks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (calling after him)
dialog: Oh, I know all about integrity. I
dialog: know even more about persistence.
dialog: Look that one up.
dialog: 
text: Max watches Viktor depart, with obvious suspicion.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - STUDIO LOT - DAY
dialog: 
text: A large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage.
dialog: 
text: "CLOSED SET" is the sign on the door -- a surveillance camera
text: panning the entrance. A SECURITY GUARD, also keeping watch,
text: nods a greeting to VIKTOR as he pulls up in his studio golf
text: cart, script in hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: No one came in or went out just
dialog: like you said, Mr. Taransky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Is Miss Simone coming today?
dialog:

dialog: She's already here. She arrived
dialog: before you and she'll leave long
dialog: after you've gone.
dialog: (admonishing guard)
dialog: Remember, under no circumstances
dialog: are you or any other person to
dialog: enter the set without my express
dialog: permission.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: What if it catches on fire?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Let it burn. Simone would rather
dialog: go up in flames than give up her
dialog: privacy.
dialog: 
text: Viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters
dialog: the soundstage.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The cavernous soundstage is almost completely empty save for
text: a small table upon which sits two computer keyboards and a
text: tablet attached to a large, projection screen monitor and two
text: side monitors. VIKTOR takes a seat in front of the monitor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (to himself as he inserts
dialog: his Hollywood hard-drive
speaker_heading: -- SIMULATION ONE)
dialog: Pay no attention to the man behind
dialog: the computer.
dialog: 
text: A title appears on his computer screen.
dialog: 
dialog: Welcome
dialog: to
speaker_heading: SIMULATION ONE
dialog: 
text: With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he
dialog: revises the title to:
dialog: 
dialog: Welcome
dialog: to
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: 
text: He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon
text: wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian
text: emerges -- SIMONE. She is indistinguishable from a flesh-and
dialog: blood actress.
dialog: 
text: Simone moves on a video loop against a neutral background --
text: titled "VISUAL LOOP 6". Within the confines of the monitor
text: she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal. She looks a
text: little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for
dialog: too long.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (to the screen)
dialog: Good morning, Simone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: A star is...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: ... digitized.
dialog: 
dialog: Only now do we observe that Viktor is occasionally talking
text: into a microphone connected to the computer and pressing a
text: key on his keyboard. When he speaks, she speaks. Simone's
text: voice and mouth movements automatically sync in response to
text: Viktor's voice. A scanning light on Viktor allows Simone to
dialog: mimic his movements.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: You mean they buy it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (nervous smile as he
dialog: examines his first
dialog: royalty check)
dialog: Buy it? They're paying for it.
dialog: And around here that's how you
dialog: really know they buy it.
dialog: 
text: Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to
dialog: the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I'm only sorry Hank isn't here to
dialog: see this.
dialog: 
text: Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: (depressing the button
dialog: every time he wants to
dialog: express his thoughts
dialog: through Simone)
dialog: Maybe he can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Do you have any idea what this
dialog: means, Simone? Our ability to
dialog: manufacture fraud now exceeds our
dialog: ability to detect it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: (appearing to indulge
dialog: Viktor with a smile)
dialog: I am the death of real.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (pondering the enormity of
dialog: the hoax)
dialog: You are birth of... what? A
dialog: Phenomenon. A miracle. A new era
dialog: in show business. All I wanted to
dialog: do was finish the film.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: And now look what you've started.
dialog: And now look what you've started.
dialog: And now look what you've started.
dialog: 
text: Viktor's conversation with himself is not merely for his own
text: amusement. He is adjusting and refining Simone's voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Hmm... a little less Streep, a
dialog: little more Bacall.
dialog: 
text: Viktor scrolls through a photo library of stars, living and
dialog: dead, that comprise Simone.
dialog: 
text: Viktor makes an adjustment on a panel on the computer screen
text: dedicated to Simone's audio, incorporating the vocal
dialog: deliveries -- "20% STREEP, 80% BACALL".
dialog: 
text: He speaks once again as Simone to test the adjustment. The
text: voice patterns appear on his screen -- graphic
dialog: representations of the sound waves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Yes. Yes, it is.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR snaps back to reality himself. He scrolls through the
text: list of screen legends. He clicks on the image of AUDREY
speaker_heading: HEPBURN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: While I think of it, I'd like you
dialog: to add something to your repertoire
dialog: -- remember that thing Hepburn does
dialog: in "Breakfast At Tiffany's".
dialog: 
text: A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on
text: the screen. Hepburn, sitting on a fire escape, looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDREY HEPBURN
dialog: (from the screen, an
dialog: incomparable smile)
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (pausing the moment)
dialog: Let's hear you say "Hi" like
dialog: Audrey.
dialog: 
text: With a CUT and PASTE, Viktor morphs the gesture seamlessly
text: into a frozen Simone. Viktor presses play.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: (imitating Audrey's
dialog: performance perfectly)
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Perfect.
dialog: (stretching)
dialog: God, I'm so relaxed around you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: You did create me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: No. I... just helped bring someone
dialog: else's dream to life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: Mr. Taransky, we both know I was
dialog: nothing without you. I was
dialog: computer code -- ones and zeros.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You're right. You're right. Of
dialog: course, one doesn't want to boast.
dialog: It's a classic case of technology
dialog: in search of an artist. That's all
dialog: you've been waiting for, an artist
dialog: with integrity, with a vision, who
dialog: can see.
dialog: 
text: Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warming to
text: his theme. SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor,
text: nodding attentively as if she's really interested.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: See beyond that irrational
dialog: allegiance to flesh and blood. --
dialog: See that with the rise in price of
dialog: a real actor and the fall in price
dialog: of a fake, the scales have tipped
dialog: in favor of the fake.
dialog: (voice raising in
dialog: excitement)
dialog: -- See that if the performance is
dialog: genuine, it doesn't matter if the
dialog: actor is real. Once a performance
dialog: is committed to film, the blood and
dialog: bones are gone anyway. Only the
dialog: spirit, the illusion remains.
dialog: Besides, what's real anymore?
dialog: These days most actors have digital
dialog: work done to them so it's a gray
dialog: area.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: (Simone appears to look
dialog: directly at her maker)
dialog: Are you ever going to tell the
dialog: truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
text: The only real truth is in the work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: You know what I'm talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Yes. Yes, I'm going to tell the
dialog: truth about you, why wouldn't I...?
dialog: (pondering his own
dialog: question)
dialog: Of course, with Hank's tragic
text: passing, the secret died with him.
dialog: (shaking the thought from
dialog: his head)
dialog: I am going to tell the truth...
dialog: after your next picture.
dialog: 
text: Feeling uneasy at the prospect, Viktor changes the subject.
text: He pulls out his script for "ETERNITY FOREVER".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Speaking of which -- this is the
dialog: project I'd like you to do next.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: Not, "Eternity Forever"? The
dialog: legendary unproduced script that
dialog: was too good ever to get made? I'd
dialog: kill for that part.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I was hoping you'd say that.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
dialog: Taransky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (pretending to be hard of
dialog: hearing)
dialog: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: I'll do anything to please you, Mr.
dialog: Taransky.
dialog: 
text: On a side monitor, we discover a highlighted box marked "PRE
text: RECORD" -- Viktor's finger on the "PLAY" button. He is
text: unable to resist speaking another line.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: And I will never, ever leave you.
dialog: 
text: Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss --
text: until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked,
scene_heading: "GESTURES OF AFFECTION -- WINK, SMILE, GIGGLE, SIGH, KISS,
text: FLUTTER OF EYES, FLICK OF HAIR, PUFF OF CHEST".
dialog: 
text: Viktor comes close to the monitor. He notices something
dialog: about Simone's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You're so beautiful. Too
dialog: beautiful.
dialog: 
text: Viktor accesses a program labeled, "DISTINGUISHING FEATURES".
text: He adds a "FRECKLE" and a "MOLE".
dialog: 
text: From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast,
text: empty soundstage.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR's face against the SKY. As he walks, we reveal that
text: the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the
text: studio lot -- behind a parking lot. Viktor hands his valet
text: ticket to a fawning VALET MANAGER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VALET MANAGER
dialog: -- Just be a minute, Mr. Taransky.
dialog: We gave you a complimentary car
dialog: wash -- they're washing the engine
dialog: now.
dialog: 
text: Viktor joins other industry MOVERS and SHAKERS waiting for
text: their cars under an umbrella. A young TALENT AGENT
dialog: approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALENT AGENT
dialog: Viktor! Look, I'm sorry I didn't
dialog: call you back last year. I was,
dialog: er... out of the country.
dialog: (strained moment)
dialog: But we should get together. My
text: schedule's wide open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Sure, I'll... "call you".
dialog: 
text: The agent's face falls. He gets in his car, disconsolate.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Hello, Hal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: The film. The chemistry. No
dialog: reflections on Nicola but Simone
dialog: and I -- we were just so right
dialog: together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You never were together, Hal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: And still the connection was
dialog: undeniable.
dialog: (aside)
dialog: I haven't read "Eternity Forever"
dialog: but I know it's brilliant. And I
dialog: know I would be perfect for Clive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (correcting him)
dialog: Clyde.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Yes, perfect.
dialog: (lowering his voice)
dialog: As a matter of fact, I ran into
dialog: Simone on the lot the other day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (genuinely startled)
dialog: Really? She didn't mention it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (quickly covering)
dialog: I'm sure she's meeting with a lot
dialog: of people right now.
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: She is just as you described her,
dialog: Viktor... indescribable. I
dialog: strongly sensed she thought I was
dialog: right for it.
dialog: 
text: Behind his back, Viktor surreptitiously presses a button on
text: his cell phone. The phone rings. Viktor feigns surprise and
dialog: answers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (answering the phone he
dialog: has just dialed, louder
dialog: than necessary)
dialog: Hello?... SIMONE! How are you,
dialog: sweetheart?
dialog: 
text: A hush descends over the executives. Hal is suddenly very
text: uncomfortable. Even the VALETS strain to eavesdrop on the
dialog: conversation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (winking to Hal)
dialog: You'll never guess who I'm with...
dialog: you ran into him on the lot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: It was more in passing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You're so far off!
dialog: (finally chuckles)
dialog: Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co-
dialog: star. Remember now?... No, I don't
dialog: think he's put on weight.
dialog: (a shrug of apology to the
dialog: appalled Hal)
dialog: Anyway, you think he's right for
dialog: "Eternity Forever"?... not the
dialog: right type?... a different
dialog: direction...
dialog: (covering phone, to Hal)
dialog: I'll try to talk her into it.
dialog: 
text: The other INDUSTRY PEOPLE make a note of the remark. A
text: mortified Hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing
dialog: into his car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: ... Listen this is a bad place to
dialog: talk... what?... sweetheart, I know
dialog: you have charity work you want to
dialog: do, I know you want to give back --
dialog: but remember, your greatest gift is
dialog: your talent... we'll talk about it
dialog: at the beach house this weekend...
dialog: I'm looking forward to it too.
dialog: 
text: Viktor hangs up. His car pulls up. He tips extravagantly
text: and drives away. The INDUSTRY PEOPLE get on their cell
dialog: phones.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STUDIO LOT - FACADE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Parked behind the sky facade is a curious CAR with shaded

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: (to Max, a shake of the

dialog: I'm getting nothing from her side
dialog: of the conversation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Is it a jamming device?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: (shrugs)
text: Maybe he's talking to himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (dismissing the idea)
dialog: Taransky isn't that good an actor.
dialog: No, they're taking special
dialog: precautions. Some kind of new
dialog: encryption.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (musing)
dialog: Whatever it is, it's dark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Dark?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yes, very.

speaker_heading: VIKTOR'S VOICE

scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOME - MORNING

speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (glancing to the computer)
dialog: Can't you stop that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Those things can be dangerous.
dialog: Staring at a screen all day -- you
dialog: miss what's going on outside in the
dialog: real world. You can lose yourself.
dialog: You should get out more. How are
dialog: you going to meet boys?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: (shrugs coyly, getting up)
dialog: I know plenty of boys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Really? Who? Where do you meet
dialog: them? In a chat room? How do you
dialog: know he's not some middle-aged
dialog: freak?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak
text: a mile away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Okay. But you have to find a way
dialog: to escape that thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: I read.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You do? Still? I can't tell you
dialog: how happy I am to hear that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: You were the one who insisted on
dialog: it. Reading me Dostoyevsky and
dialog: Joyce when I was four.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You understood them. That's what
dialog: was amazing.
dialog: (looking out the window)
dialog: It's a nice day. Let's eat
dialog: outside.
dialog: 
text: Lainey grabs the plates and opens the deck door. We hear a
text: chorus of CLICKS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: Actually, it may be nicer inside.
dialog: 
text: Viktor joins her at the doorway.

speaker_heading: VIKTOR

scene_heading: EXT. VIKTOR'S MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Boats are moored just off the beach packed dangerously full

dialog: 
text: VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto
text: the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist
text: waving extravagantly.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a
text: nearby rooftop. The photographer limps towards the fence.
text: Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera
text: and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly
dialog: relishing the attention.
dialog: 
text: The photographer clambers over the fence where he joins

dialog: 
text: MAX SAYER from "The NATIONAL ECHO" is at the head of the mob,
text: accompanied by assistant MILTON.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: She sounds like a prisoner,

dialog: hostage? Are you some kind of
dialog: Svengali?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (recognizing the reporter)
dialog: Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or
dialog: you? You look kind of "captive"
dialog: yourself. While you're spending
text: every waking hour obsessing over
dialog: Simone, guess what, I guarantee she
dialog: doesn't even know you exist. Get
dialog: off my property or I'll call the
dialog: cops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The cops? The cops read my column
dialog: to know who to bust. We're the
dialog: only watchdog the public has.
dialog: (looking around at the
dialog: photographers)
dialog: None of this is going away. We'll
dialog: be here tomorrow and the day after
dialog: that. Until you slip up. And you
dialog: will. You are looking at your
dialog: shadow.
dialog: (getting in his face)
dialog: Because all these elaborate
dialog: precautions with Simone -- every
dialog: instinct in my body tells me, it's
dialog: not natural.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I'm just trying to help you, Sayer.
dialog: I don't want you to be
dialog: disappointed. It gets cold out
dialog: here at night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Nice try. If we can't get to her
dialog: through you, maybe your family will
dialog: be more co-operative. I can
dialog: guarantee you, Taransky, one way or
dialog: another, Miss Simone and I are
dialog: going to get acquainted.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Well, shoot it on the last day.
dialog: 
text: Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: As I've tried to explain to you,
dialog: Elaine. Simone isn't like any
dialog: other actress you've ever known.
dialog: She's about the work and only the
dialog: work -- lives for the work. She
dialog: wants all the money up there...
dialog: (gazing into space)
text: ... on the screen where it belongs.
dialog: She'd work for scale except I know
dialog: you only respect people you pay a
dialog: fortune.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Which accounts for your percentage.
dialog: (tossing the budget on the
dialog: coffee table)
dialog: When do I get to meet this dream?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Not today. She's learning her
dialog: lines.
dialog: (glancing to Elaine's
dialog: budget)
dialog: You can also take cue cards and
text: teleprompter out of the budget.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I'll walk you out.
dialog: 
text: Elaine escorts Viktor out to the lavish garden.

scene_heading: EXT. ELAINE'S MANSION - GARDEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: ELAINE's demeanor softens. She speaks to VIKTOR quietly,
dialog: sympathetically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to
dialog: you now, not as Elaine, studio
dialog: head, but Elaine, ex-wife.
dialog: (correcting herself)
dialog: Second ex-wife. You got lucky this
dialog: last time but you need to be
dialog: careful. We both know you wouldn't
dialog: be making this overblown art film
dialog: of you hadn't convinced Simone to
dialog: be in it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Elaine, talking to you now, not as
dialog: Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex
dialog: husband... what the hell happened
dialog: to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Experience, Viktor. I've seen this
dialog: a hundred times -- young stars
dialog: destroying the very people who
dialog: discovered them. I'm worried about
dialog: you, that's all. This woman -- she
dialog: controls your destiny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Simone does not control my destiny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Viktor, I have a feeling. One of
dialog: my feelings. There's something
dialog: about her I don't trust.
dialog: 
text: From her bedroom window on the mansion's second floor, LAINEY

text: VIKTOR enters his office where he's greeted by his assistant,
speaker_heading: JANE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (sheepish)
dialog: Thanks for taking me back, Mr.

dialog: sided with the studio, but I always
dialog: believed in you, honestly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Don't worry. I understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (referring to the cast

scene_heading: INT. SIMONE &amp; VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR sits at the head of the table, surrounded by HAL,

text: poster behind him -- "COMING THIS SUMMER - SIMONE in ETERNITY
text: FOREVER" -- bears a huge photograph of Simone's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I can't tell you how delighted I am
dialog: to have this wonderful cast
dialog: assembled for "Eternity Forever".
dialog: Thank you all. Now, a reminder --
dialog: as a condition for working on this
dialog: film, you will not be rehearsing
dialog: with Simone, shooting with Simone
dialog: and you are forbidden from
dialog: contacting Simone in any way at any
dialog: time, whatsoever.
dialog: 
text: The CAST nods seriously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (a thought occurs)
dialog: How will you do our love scenes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Body double.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (confused)
dialog: For her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: For you.
dialog: (addressing the entire
dialog: cast)
dialog: I want you to know, Simone
dialog: appreciates you all working for
dialog: scale. But why am I thanking you?
dialog: Simone can thank you herself. She
dialog: insisted on speaking with you
text: before filming begins. She's on
dialog: the line now.
dialog: 
text: Viktor nods to a speaker phone in the center of the table, a
text: red blinking light on the phone. The cast reacts excitedly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (pushing a button on the
dialog: phone)
dialog: Simone, are you there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: (through the speakerphone)
dialog: I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOTUS
dialog: (unable to contain her
dialog: excitement)
dialog: So are we, Simone!
dialog: 
text: Everyone laughs giddily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE (O.S.)
dialog: Why don't you leave me alone with
dialog: my co-stars, Mr. Taransky, so we
dialog: can get to know each other better?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Good idea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Of course. I'll be back in a
dialog: minute.
dialog: 
dialog: Viktor exits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE (O.S.)
dialog: Hi. Who's there? Don't be shy.
dialog: Introduce yourselves.
dialog: 
text: The CAST stares nervously at the speakerphone. Mac breaks
dialog: the silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I'm Mac. I turned down a
dialog: Bertolucci film to be here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOTUS
dialog: My name's Lotus. God, I can't
dialog: believe I'm talking to you. We're
dialog: going to become such great friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I'm Hal. Wonderful to be working
dialog: together... again.

dialog: 
text: VIKTOR pulls up sharply in his studio golf cart outside the
text: nearby soundstage and hurriedly enters.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR races across the vast, empty space to a digital
text: player, connected to a phone. Simone's pre-recorded opening
text: remarks (graphically represented on the screen) are almost
dialog: completed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Is that everyone...?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well, obviously, as you know...
dialog: 
text: Viktor jumps into the conversation in the nick of time,
text: speaking through the synthesizer. As usual, Viktor's voice
text: is automatically synthesized into the voice of Simone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: ... I'm Simone.
dialog: 
text: The other CAST MEMBERS laugh nervously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (from Viktor's

dialog: Obviously. Who else?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: (from speaker phone)
dialog: I just want to start by apologizing
dialog: for my "process" --
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SIMONE &amp; VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The CAST are hunched over the speakerphone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: -- No. No. I'm completely
dialog: simpatico. On my last film I was
dialog: playing a schizophrenic so I made
dialog: them give me two dressing rooms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (an aside)
dialog: So committed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE (O.S.)
dialog: Well thank you for your
dialog: understanding. I know it's an
dialog: unusual way to work but I just find
dialog: I relate better to people when
dialog: they're not actually there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOTUS
dialog: Of course, of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE (O.S.)
dialog: I don't have much to say except
dialog: that I know it's going to be a
dialog: great project, if we all just trust
dialog: Mr. Taransky's vision. Always do
dialog: what Mr. Taransky says. If in
dialog: doubt, do it the Taransky way.
dialog: 
text: They all nod vigorously in agreement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE (O.S.)
dialog: I know we're going to make a
dialog: wonderful movie together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOTUS
dialog: (nodding in agreement)
dialog: Wonderful movie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Together, absolutely.

scene_heading: EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR removes his own garbage from his soundstage. A young

speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Mr. Taransky...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR

speaker_heading: VIVIAN

dialog: Could you...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Of course...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (hesitant about broaching
dialog: the subject)
dialog: This last year I was... going
dialog: through some things.
dialog: (shaking her head at the
dialog: memory)
dialog: Awful, awful... things. But when I
dialog: saw Simone in "Sunrise"... what she
dialog: did... in the scene in the
dialog: fireworks factory...
dialog: (face lighting up)
dialog: ... suddenly everything made sense.
dialog: My friends, family, doctors --
dialog: nobody could reach me -- but
dialog: Simone, she really... spoke to me.
dialog: 
text: Viktor is touched by the heartfelt testimony.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: She'll be happy to sign it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PRODUCTION SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: A green set. Walls, floor, ceiling -- all green. A FULL

text: crossing the green expanse.
dialog: 
text: Hal pauses, looks longingly, then impulsively dashes forward.
text: Hal passionately embraces thin air and wrestles it to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR (O.S.)
dialog: Cut! Cut!... Cut!
dialog: 
text: Hal freezes. VIKTOR runs from behind the camera and
text: confronts Hal on the green floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Hal, what are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Viktor, Clyde simply has to get
dialog: close to Simone in this scene! He
dialog: has to touch her. He has to!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Absolutely not!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: But she's right there! I must feel
dialog: her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You can't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (struggling to find an
dialog: excuse)
dialog: There's... a wall between you --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: -- an emotional wall, I know.
dialog: That's why --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- No. No. A real wall.
dialog: (describing a wall with
dialog: his hands within the
dialog: green space)
dialog: You ran right through it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (confused)
dialog: How did the wall get there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I can't explain it to you now --
dialog: you'll see when it's all put
dialog: together.
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: Anyway, we got it a couple of takes
dialog: ago. Let's move on.

speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: -- What you don't understand --

text: Simone freezes again. Viktor make another adjustment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I like it. But still too big.
dialog: (making a correction)
text: Smaller teardrops next time.
dialog: 
text: Simone's tears retreat into her eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: It's not working. It's not alive.
dialog: Let's try it again.
dialog: 
text: She repeats the line. Viktor mimes the performance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: (teardrops arriving on

speaker_heading: VIKTOR

dialog: time being -- as user friendly as
dialog: you are, even I can't manufacture
dialog: an entire cast.
dialog: 
dialog: "To Vivian. Love, Simone" -- VIKTOR writes on the publicity
text: shot. He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo.
dialog: 
text: Viktor wipes his mouth and looks to SIMONE on his screen --
text: she is waiting patiently, as usual.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: We are going to have to change our
dialog: plans, Simone -- you have no idea
dialog: what an affect your performance is
dialog: having on people. We can't stop
dialog: now. There's too much to say --
dialog: these films they speak, they speak
dialog: to the human condition. We're
dialog: changing lives. No, revealing the
dialog: truth now would be too cruel.
dialog: (searching for more
dialog: justification)
dialog: Anyway, when you're seeking a
dialog: greater truth -- in the work -- you
dialog: are not so concerned with the
dialog: lesser truths along the way.
dialog: 
text: Simone doesn't appear convinced.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: You're going to get in a lot of
dialog: trouble, Mr. Taransky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
text: (irritated at her pricking
dialog: his conscience)
dialog: Why do you have to bring that up?
dialog: There's always risk -- life's a
dialog: risk. It's worth it. Besides, how
dialog: could something so lovely be a
dialog: crime?
dialog: (regarding her tenderly)
dialog: Well, I think we've done enough for
dialog: today. You've been cooped up in
dialog: there too long. How about you and
dialog: me go out on the town? They're
dialog: expecting us.
dialog: 
text: He turns to a copy of "The Echo". A photo of Viktor at the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR

dialog: You will switch off all

dialog: 
text: B) VIKTOR sprays cologne in the bed.
dialog:

text: E) VIKTOR puts one of his own movies in the DVD player.
dialog: 
text: F) VIKTOR writes a note on the bedside pad.
dialog: 
text: G) In the bathroom, shower running, VIKTOR attempts to open
text: a tampon -- it shoots out of the applicator like a penny
dialog: rocket.
dialog: 
text: H) VIKTOR cuts a lock of "faux" hair from a Simone wig and
text: scatters it on the counter.
dialog: 
text: I) VIKTOR shakes open a bag of toiletries, the toothbrush
text: bouncing into the toilet bowl. He retrieves it.
dialog: 
text: J) VIKTOR looks through the drapes of the hotel window -- a
text: jam of PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS has congregated outside the
dialog: rear entrance.
dialog: 
text: K) VIKTOR shines a lamp against a doll casting a life-size
text: shadow on the drapes. A "walking" silhouette is visible
text: to the media on the street.
dialog: 
dialog: L) VIKTOR writes a message in lipstick on the mirror -- "I
dialog: LOVE YOU V--".

speaker_heading: VIKTOR

dialog: Where's "Matinee"? There they are.

dialog: 
dialog: B) MAX examines the wet soap from the shower and also places
text: it in a plastic bag.
dialog: 
text: C) MAX picks up the used toothbrush, puts it to his lips
text: before placing it in a plastic bag.
dialog: 
text: D) MAX gently places his hands on the toilet seat.
dialog:

text: a pillow. He folds it meticulously, appearing to breathe
text: in its scent as he places it in a plastic bag.
dialog: 
text: F) Finally, MAX kneels and gazes at "Simone's" unmade bed.

text: and Faith are still pressed together against one side of the
dialog: limousine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (not quite able to avert
dialog: his eyes from her
dialog: telescopic legs)
dialog: Thank God for you, Faith. I know
dialog: this is above and beyond the call
dialog: of duty for a stand-in. You don't
dialog: know what a service you're
dialog: performing for Simone -- shielding
dialog: her from those animals.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No, thank God for you, Mr.
dialog: Taransky. How many men would go

dialog: intimate position.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You understand you'll have to come

speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Of course.

speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Yes, of course, but very beautiful

speaker_heading: VIKTOR

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR watches the rough cut of "ETERNITY FOREVER" with
text: ELAINE and daughter, LAINEY. As usual, they are mesmerized
text: by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE. The scene ends. The
dialog: light go up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Stunning, Viktor. The Hollywood
dialog: Foreign Press is going to eat this
dialog: up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (turning to his daughter)
dialog: What did you think, Lainey?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: One thing bothered me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: No, not that. I was just wondering
dialog: -- in the bedroom scene in reel two
dialog: why did Simone have no reflection
dialog: when she walked in front of that
dialog: mirror?
dialog: 
text: Viktor is shocked, busted. He covers it with a laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (ashen-faced)
dialog: I wondered if you'd spot that.
dialog: You've got a good eye, Lainey. I'm
dialog: proud of you.
dialog: 
text: Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I got them to remove the
dialog: reflection. The mirror's metaphor
dialog: -- to show how her character's
text: inwardly dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: That's genius, Viktor. Was that
dialog: Simone's idea?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (sarcastic, annoyed at the
dialog: suggestion)
dialog: Who else? It's always Simone's
dialog: idea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: (not quite convinced)
dialog: So that accounts for the lack of a
dialog: shadow in reel six?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Precisely.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STUDIO LOT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaine's car parked
dialog: outside the theater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: (as she gets into the car)
dialog: Good-night, Daddy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (kissing Lainey good-bye)
dialog: Night, Lainey.
dialog: 
text: Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (drawing Elaine aside)
dialog: Elaine, I don't know if it's a good
dialog: idea for Lainey to come to the
dialog: screenings -- mature content and
dialog: all that.
dialog: 
text: Both look to Lainey. From inside the car Lainey watches her
dialog: parents.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (impressed by his
dialog: responsible attitude)
dialog: Maybe you're right.
dialog: (gently teasing)
dialog: Twelve years after your daughter's
dialog: born you decide to become a father.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Better late than never.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (softening)
dialog: I should fire you more often. The
dialog: film's looking wonderful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You really think so?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Yes. To be honest I never quite
dialog: saw this film before -- maybe it's
dialog: the way Simone is playing it -- but
dialog: what it's saying about the illusion
dialog: of permanence in everyday life, how
dialog: that's the only way we can love --
dialog: I think it's really going to mean
dialog: something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Thank you. I'll tell Simone you
dialog: liked it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I'd love to tell her myself.
dialog: (cajoling)
dialog: When are you going to let me meet
dialog: her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Soon. Soon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Everyone I know has met her,
dialog: Viktor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Everyone you know is lying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (amused)
dialog: That's true.
dialog: 
text: They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before.
text: However, their embrace is interrupted by a click of a camera
text: shutter from a nearby bush.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Damnit!
dialog: 
text: The PHOTOGRAPHER has gone but so has the mood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You know how you can stop that.
dialog: She has to get out more.
dialog: (climbing into the car)
dialog: See you at the premiere.
dialog: 
text: Elaine climbs into her car and drives away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PREMIERE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had
dialog: hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET". Red carpet, klieg lights
text: searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.
dialog: 
text: A limousine pulls up, door opens and VIKTOR steps out. The
text: crowd screams with excitement.
dialog: 
text: Viktor waves. Am expectancy in the crowd -- people crane
text: their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open
text: car door... but nothing. The door shuts. A disappointed
text: murmer. The limo drives off.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR walks down the carpet to little fanfare.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREMIERE REPORTER 1
dialog: (talking to camera)
dialog: -- What a night! Anyone who's
dialog: anyone is here at the premiere of
dialog: "Eternity Forever," but waiting for
dialog: Simone to show may take even
dialog: longer. We do have her director,
dialog: Viktor Taransky.
dialog: (ushering him over)
dialog: Viktor, Viktor, is Simone coming?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (slightly irritated by the
dialog: focus on the star)
dialog: You know Simone.
dialog: 
text: Other reporters force their way into the interview.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREMIERE REPORTER 2
dialog: I hope she does show up. Some of
dialog: her fans got here at dawn. We
dialog: don't want to disappoint them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (through a pained smile)
dialog: Well, I'm sure they're going to
dialog: love the movie. I got the
dialog: inspiration --
dialog: 
text: However, the reporter's attention has strayed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREMIERE REPORTER 2
speaker_heading: HARRY EPSON!
dialog: 
text: The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor. Screen idol, HARRY
text: EPSON, is walking up the carpet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREMIERE REPORTER 2
dialog: Harry! Harry! Can we have a
dialog: minute? What brings you here
dialog: tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (waving to the fans)
dialog: I just came out to support my good
dialog: friend, Simone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREMIERE REPORTER 2
dialog: There's a rumor that you're more
dialog: than just "good friends"?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (slightly irritated by the
dialog: invasion)
dialog: We've been seeing each other, sure,
dialog: but we'd rather keep our
dialog: relationship private.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PREMIERE REPORTER 2
dialog: (believing she has a
dialog: scoop)
dialog: Do I hear the sound of... wedding
dialog: bells?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (suddenly losing it)
dialog: I can't believe you people! No
dialog: wonder she never comes to these
dialog: things!
dialog: 
text: Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the
dialog: carpet.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR watches him go, flabbergasted.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PREMIERE PARTY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A packed, glitzy party. VIKTOR enters without an escort.
text: Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely
dialog: alone.
dialog: 
text: He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT,
text: schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOVER/SHAKER
dialog: Elaine! The picture is a
dialog: revelation!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Thank you. I mean, it was a team
dialog: effort --
dialog: 
text: Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small
text: pocket camera. Elaine is unaware of the shot.
dialog: 
text: Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.
dialog: 
text: Viktor picks up a drink from the bar. A DRUNK WOMAN, perched
text: unsteadily on a nearby barstool, is knocking back Jack
text: Daniels. She accidentally brushes one of her discarded
text: glasses off the bar. Viktor catches it.
dialog: 
text: A HAND taps Viktor on the shoulder. HAL stands there
text: accompanied by his "Eternity Forever" co-star, MAC.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Is she here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I'm fine, Hal. How are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (oblivious to his sarcasm)
dialog: Somebody said she was here.
dialog: 
text: Mac spots the two glasses in Viktor's hands -- one glass
dialog: lipstick-smeared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Oh my God, that's her glass!
dialog: (impulsively smelling
dialog: "Simone's" glass)
dialog: Jack Daniels, straight-up. She is
dialog: my kind of woman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (looking anxiously around
dialog: the room)
dialog: Viktor, where is she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: She's around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAC
text: (dawning on him, glancing
dialog: to the far side of the
dialog: packed room)
dialog: Jesus, Hal... she's in the Ladies
dialog: Room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You know I sometimes forget she has
dialog: bodily functions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (unable to resist)
dialog: I know what you mean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (anxiously looking to the
dialog: restroom)
dialog: I have to talk to her about my
dialog: experimental film. It's very...
dialog: experimental.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Is that her? -- By the fountain.
dialog: 
text: Far across the party, a WOMAN, with a Simone-type hairstyle,
text: her back to us, is standing at the edge of a fountain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (testy)
dialog: No. In fact, between us, she
dialog: doesn't really exist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
text: (ignoring him, calling out
dialog: to the woman)
dialog: Simone!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAC
speaker_heading: SIMONE!
dialog: 
text: Several nearby GUESTS, including ELAINE, overhear. They talk
dialog: over each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUEST 1
dialog: -- Simone's here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (slightly the worse for
dialog: drink)
dialog: -- When did she arrive? Why didn't
dialog: someone tell me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUEST 2
dialog: -- Where is she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: -- She's by the fountain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUEST 3
dialog: -- Simone, over here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUEST 4
dialog: -- Simone!
dialog: 
text: The rumor races through the party like wild-fire. The GUESTS
text: surge towards the fountain in a wave of mindless adoration.
dialog: 
text: The Simone lookalike herself spins around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOOKALIKE WOMAN
dialog: Simone!
dialog: 
text: She gets knocked into the fountain. Several other GUESTS
dialog: also fall in the stampede.
dialog: 
text: Back at the bar, the BARMAN, autograph book in hand, deserts
text: his station. Viktor is left alone with the drunk woman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOCAL TV NEWS
dialog: 
text: The limousines outside the hotel ballroom have been replaced
text: with ambulances. PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and
text: battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
dialog: (into microphone)
dialog: -- Forget "Eternity Forever", the
dialog: big news tonight was the surprise
dialog: appearance of Simone. Even these
dialog: seen-it-all superstars are
dialog: apparently not immune to Simone
dialog: fever and the resulting stampede
dialog: forced organizers to bring the
dialog: event to an early end. I spoke
dialog: with some of the departing guests
dialog: about their encounter with
dialog: Hollywood's most reluctant
dialog: superstar.
dialog: 
text: CUTS of interviews with VARIOUS bruised GUESTS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 3
dialog: -- I would say, even more beautiful
dialog: in person, you have to see her to
dialog: believe her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALE GUEST 1
dialog: -- I can't reveal what we spoke
dialog: about. It was... personal. Simone
dialog: and I go back a long way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST 1
dialog: -- When she talks to you, for that
dialog: moment, you are the only other
text: human being in the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST 2
dialog: (dress torn)
dialog: -- I really don't know what the
text: fuss is about. So over-rated.
dialog: She's done one film. Talk to me
dialog: when she's had the kind of career
dialog: I've had.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALE GUEST 2
dialog: -- I do expect her to be nominated,
dialog: yes.
dialog: 
text: We return to the live shot of the ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER
dialog: Fortunately, Simone was not amongst

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ECHO OFFICES - DAY
dialog: 
text: In the ECHO war room, MAX SAYER is agitated. He paces back
text: and forth, railing at a table of cowering STAFFERS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: -- She goes to a major, Hollywood,
dialog: A-list party and we don't get an
dialog: interview, a comment, we don't even
dialog: get a photograph? Is that what
dialog: you're telling me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ECHO PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Nobody got a photograph. Nobody
dialog: ever gets a photograph.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: We've got our best people on it,
dialog: Mr. Sayer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: 24-hour tail on Taransky?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Shutter bugs camped outside any
dialog: place he goes, every concierge and
dialog: maitre d' on the take. But this
dialog: Simone woman is good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (referring to a
dialog: "Confidential" FBI
dialog: report)
dialog: Obviously the name isn't real --
text: she's using an assumed identity,
dialog: travels under a false name, checks
dialog: into hotels with an alias. She
dialog: never stays in the same place two
dialog: nights in a row. Anything on the
dialog: satellite photos?
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: What about the fingerprints? What
dialog: happened when we dusted that hotel
dialog: suite?
dialog: 
text: MILTON holds up a glass taken from the hotel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Well, we got some of Taransky's
dialog: fingerprints, a lot of your
dialog: fingerprints... but none of hers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (interest piqued)
dialog: Which means they're significant.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Incriminating.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Perhaps, criminal.
dialog: (getting excited)
dialog: She's hiding her past. She's
dialog: hiding her past.
dialog: 
text: Max ponders the revelation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Of course -- no one's that perfect,
dialog: that pure. You know I had
dialog: something on Mother Teresa. But
dialog: then she died and it wasn't worth
dialog: it anymore.
dialog: (approaching a computer)
dialog: I know how to flush out this Simone
dialog: -- a tell-all story from her
dialog: childhood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: My God, you've got one?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (offering Milton a seat in
dialog: front of the computer)
dialog: I will when you're finished writing
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: MILTON hesitates, questioning his journalistic ethics.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (disappointed in his
dialog: protege)
dialog: Am I wasting my time with you?
dialog: When she sues to protect her
dialog: privacy, she'll have to appear in a
dialog: public courtroom to do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Long live the First Amendment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Sometimes you have to tell a small
dialog: lie to get to the bigger truth.
dialog: (to his nervous
dialog: photographer)
dialog: As for a photo -- if you can't do
dialog: it, I know twelve million people
dialog: who can.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE UP on The Echo magazine -- "CIRCULATION - 12 MILLION".
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY
dialog: 
text: "MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE!" -- Is the
text: headline on the cover of The ECHO. VIKTOR is reading the
text: magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.
dialog: 
text: He looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his
text: soundstage. A group of STUDIO EXECUTIVES, led by ELAINE, is
text: trying to break into the "CLOSED SET". VIKTOR runs towards
text: the door, throwing himself between the door and the
dialog: executives.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- You can't go in there!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: -- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 1
dialog: -- We know she's in there!
dialog: 
text: Viktor glares at the SECURITY GUARD who shrugs weakly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (struggling to hold them
dialog: back)
dialog: -- Why? What's all this about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 2
dialog: (waving a spreadsheet)
dialog: -- We've got the tracking numbers
dialog: for "Eternity Forever".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 3
dialog: -- They're in the toilet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: -- She has to get out there and
dialog: sell the film.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- What do you want her to do, go
dialog: door-to-door -- ?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 1
dialog: -- Even Garbo would be on the talk
dialog: show circuit if she was alive
dialog: today.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: -- It's precisely because she
dialog: doesn't crave the limelight that
dialog: people love her. I told you, she's
dialog: only about the work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 3
dialog: -- This is over-shadowing the work!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 2
dialog: (waving the front page of
dialog: The Echo)
dialog: That's the problem. She's more
dialog: famous for her no-shows than her
dialog: shows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: -- It's starting to look like she
dialog: doesn't support the film or you,
dialog: Viktor.
dialog: (trying to squeeze past
dialog: Viktor)
dialog: If you can't handle her, I will.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (blocking her path)
dialog: Not now. She's emotional. Her
dialog: mother dies today. Scene forty-two
dialog: of "Good For Nothing". It's not a
dialog: good time.
dialog: 
text: Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower
dialog: Viktor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: No! Please, don't go in there!
dialog: 
text: Too late. Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: ELAINE and the EXECUTIVES stop in their tracks -- confronted
text: with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the
text: vast soundstage. A desperate VIKTOR catches up with them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 1
dialog: Where is she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 2
dialog: She's not here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Elaine... I...
dialog: 
text: Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing
dialog: smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: So, the secret's finally out,
dialog: Viktor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- I can explain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: -- I don't think that's necessary.
dialog: I think it's perfectly clear. I
dialog: should have guessed -- it all makes
dialog: sense now... it's why she never
dialog: goes anywhere, never seen in
dialog: public...
dialog: 
text: Viktor lowers his head, resigned to his fate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: She's into computers.
dialog: 
text: Viktor looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 1
dialog: (nodding in agreement)
dialog: Probably spends her whole life in
dialog: chat rooms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 2
dialog: It's the one place she can be
dialog: herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 3
dialog: Anonymous.
dialog: 
text: Viktor seizes on the opportunity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (adopting a serious tone)
dialog: It's worse than you think. She's
dialog: extremely agoraphobic -- has a
dialog: morbid fear of people and germs.
dialog: In a way I'm relieved you... found
dialog: out.
dialog: 
text: The Executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: The premiere was the first time
dialog: I've convinced her to venture out
dialog: and it just confirmed her worst
dialog: nightmares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Viktor, you should have said
dialog: something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: She doesn't want pity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (seeing a new side of
dialog: Viktor)
dialog: You're so good to protect her like
dialog: this.
dialog: 
text: Viktor shrugs modestly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (to the Executives,
dialog: conceding)
dialog: I'll tell you what. I know how
dialog: much this means to you. I'll try
dialog: to get her to plug the film.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm not promising anything but
dialog: maybe she'll do a talk show --
dialog: taped.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I'll try. Maybe live but remote.
dialog: She'll never go to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 1
dialog: We understand. Thank you, Viktor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 2
dialog: Give her our best.
dialog: 
text: Satisfied, the Executives make their way out of the
dialog: soundstage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 1
dialog: (aside to a colleague)
dialog: That agoraphobia -- it's like a
dialog: plague.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE 2
dialog: It's out of control in Europe.
dialog: 
text: Viktor and Elaine are left alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to
dialog: introduce you to Simone at the
dialog: premiere. There wasn't time with
dialog: the riot and everything.
dialog: (picking up a framed photo
dialog: from the work station)
dialog: But she wanted you to have this.
dialog: 
text: The photograph shows ELAINE, slightly inebriated at the
text: premiere, SIMONE standing slightly behind her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: She was there. She didn't by any
dialog: chance happen to mention me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: She said you were very beautiful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (flattered)
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (blurting out)
dialog: Elaine, what are you doing tonight?
dialog: Would you like to go somewhere --
dialog: dinner?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I'd love to. But aren't you
dialog: supposed to meet up with Simone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Oh, yes. Of course. Don't I
dialog: always?
dialog: 
text: Viktor watches Elaine make her way back to her studio cart.
dialog: 
text: Viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the National

speaker_heading: SAYER.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: An unattended shopping cart, at the end of the frozen foods

dialog: 
text: We discover VIKTOR, pulling the cart with fishing line, while
text: at the same time shooting it with a video camera.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Viktor's home video of the shopping cart plays on a TV.
text: However, now SIMONE is pushing the cart. She wears

text: a Swanson Chicken Pot Pie out of a cabinet... then a box of
text: cereal off a display.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ECHO OFFICES - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Assistant MILTON enters. He looks ill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (irritated at being
dialog: interrupted)
dialog: What do you want -- ?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million
dialog: bucks yet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (never averting his eyes
dialog: from the screen)
dialog: -- Cashier's check went out to our
dialog: anonymous tipster this morning --
dialog: worth every penny too. Who says
dialog: there's no place for checkbook

dialog: stills of this for months, then
dialog: release the whole tape -- we'll get
dialog: our money back -- maybe show it on
text: an exclusive pay-per-view event.
dialog: Do you realize what we have here?
dialog: We have the only independent
dialog: footage of Simone in existence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: We used to.

speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: (holding a copy of the

dialog: section - "Simone Live")
dialog: She's doing Frank Brand on

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Get out.
dialog: 
dialog: A TV
dialog:

speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: Tonight on Frank Brand Live --
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: ELAINE, KENT and LAINEY watch the TV interview in Elaine's
text: mansion with eager anticipation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: -- Since taking the nation by storm
dialog: with her debut movie, "Sunrise,
dialog: Sunset"...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
dialog: 
text: MAX SAYER and assistant MILTON are also glued to their set.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: ... no one's managed to land a live
dialog: TV interview with the fabulous, new
dialog: shooting starlet, Simone... until
dialog: now.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Casually tacked up on the monitor is the MILLION DOLLAR CHECK
speaker_heading: from The ECHO.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR, face and body scanned by the computer, is making a
text: final test of his equipment. When he touches his hair, bats
text: his eyes, moves his hands -- so does Simone.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR frantically tests several different backgrounds behind
text: SIMONE from a library of images. Rainforest. Desert. Ritzy
dialog: hotel suite. Moonscape. Factory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: Make up your mind, Viktor. Make up
dialog: your mind.
dialog: 
text: He settles on the desert location.
dialog: 
dialog: He also make a last-second change to Simone's wardrobe --
text: selecting "TOO-TIGHT SWEATER".
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: FRANK BRAND talks to camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: I'm happy to say she's agreed to
dialog: join us tonight from the set of her
dialog: new film.
dialog: (turning to the TV
dialog: monitor)
dialog: Welcome, Simone.
dialog: 
text: The just-completed image of SIMONE appears on Brand's
dialog: monitor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Wonderful to be with you, Frank.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: KENT, referring to Simone, forgetting or not caring that
text: Elaine is in the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENT
dialog: She is all woman.
dialog: 
text: LAINEY shoots her mother's boyfriend a withering look. She
text: gets up and leaves the room.
dialog: 
dialog: During the interview we cut between Frank Brand's studio,
text: Viktor's soundstage and various viewer locations including
dialog: Elaine's mansion, Max Sayer's office and various worldwide
dialog: locations --
dialog: 
text: A) A lone AFGHANI SHEPHERD gazing at a Watchman.
dialog: 
text: B) A JAPANESE COUPLE watching TV in a capsule hotel room.
dialog: 
text: C) A CATHOLIC CARDINAL watching TV in the Vatican.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: Well, no one could accuse you of
dialog: being over-exposed, Simone. Why
dialog: have you stayed so completely out
dialog: of the limelight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I just think actors talk too much.
dialog: Does the world really want to hear
dialog: your life story just because you've
dialog: got a movie opening Friday?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: Of course, the only problem with
dialog: shying away from publicity these
dialog: days is that it tends to attract
dialog: more.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR is in his element, his effeminate gestures
text: frighteningly convincing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: (from TV)
dialog: Don't I know it. That's the only
dialog: reason I'm here now -- to put the
dialog: attention back where it belongs, on
dialog: Mr. Taransky's film.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: You don't secretly want the
dialog: attention?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: I'm not even sure I deserve it.
dialog: After tonight I'll have almost as
dialog: much screen time on your show as I
dialog: do in my movies. How is that
dialog: healthy for a performer?
dialog: 
scene_heading: IE. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: LAINEY has turned her back on the TV screen, preferring to
dialog: look through a book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: (from TV)
dialog: Because, you have to understand,
dialog: Frank, these interviews -- none of
dialog: this is real. Who I am on screen
dialog: and who I really am are two totally
dialog: different people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: Who are you really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: That's a good question.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man
dialog: strives long and hard to appear
dialog: someone else..."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: (reading from a bookmarked
dialog: page, along with Simone)
dialog: "... he ends up finding it is
dialog: difficult to be himself again."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: Well put.
dialog: 
dialog: Lainey regards the name written on the inside page -- "Viktor
dialog: Taransky".
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAX SAYER'S OFFICE - THE ECHO - DAY
dialog: 
text: TV playing in the background, MAX and MILTON are hurriedly
text: leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (focusing on the desert
dialog: background behind Simone)
dialog: I know where that is... I know...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: Change of topic. Simone, you've
dialog: been romantically linked to dozens
dialog: of men in the press -- Mick Jagger,
dialog: Stephen Hawking, Fidel Castro...
dialog: and most recently Viktor Taransky.
dialog: Is there a Mr. Right in there
dialog: somewhere?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: I'd rather not discuss my private
dialog: life.
dialog: (gently)
dialog: But Viktor and I are inseparable.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: ELAINE's face drops, slightly hurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENT
dialog: You dog, Viktor!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: (from TV)
dialog: I literally wouldn't be here today
dialog: without him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR accidentally taps his finger on the keyboard in his
text: excitement -- the cursor aimed at "TEARS" command. SIMONE'S
text: EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: Would you like a moment, Simone?
dialog: 
text: Viktor notices, quickly withdrawing his finger -- his
text: startled expression instantly imitated by Simone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: No, I'm okay.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: Let's talk about the work that you
dialog: care so much about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Sure. Where would you like to
dialog: start?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: How about the nudity?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Nudity has just never been an issue
dialog: for me, Frank. For me, clothes are
dialog: just an option.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: What exactly was it that attracted
dialog: you to your first two projects?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: (unable to resist a smile)
dialog: I suppose the thing I like most
dialog: about the movies I'm in is that
dialog: they're not about special effects.
dialog: 
text: Frank nods sagely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: They're better for it if I may say.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTOR's face by a blinking
dialog: alert:
dialog: 
text: !!INSUFFICIENT MEMORY TO COMPLETE THIS TASK!!
dialog: 
text: The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up. Curiously, it
text: is only Simone and not the background that is disintegrating.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FRANK BRAND TV STUDIO - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK BRAND
dialog: (regarding the screen)
dialog: Well, we appear to be experiencing
dialog: satellite difficulties. In case we
dialog: lose you, Simone, I want to thank
dialog: you --
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: Thank... YOU, FRANK.
dialog: 
text: In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug. The feed goes
text: blank on Frank Brand's screen.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR slumps over his computer in exhaustion. Since SIMONE
text: is still synced to his movements, the partially de-pixelated
text: Simone also slumps.
dialog: 
text: Viktor's cell phone rings. Viktor picks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR / SIMONE
dialog: Hel--
dialog: 
text: He remembers at the last second to switch off his voice
dialog: synthesizer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: We cut between the two sides of the conversation -- ELAINE on
text: the phone, KENT still watching post-interview analysis on the
dialog: TV.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: -- Viktor, are you with her? Is
dialog: she there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: An anxious beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Are you and Simone...
dialog: (blurting it out)
dialog: ... getting married?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (taken aback by the
dialog: suggestion)
dialog: No, of course not!
dialog: (realizing the
dialog: significance of the
dialog: question)
dialog: Why? Would you care if we were?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (covering, realizing she
dialog: has given herself away)
dialog: Well, yes. From a studio point of
dialog: view, it would be better if Simone
dialog: stayed single.
dialog: (quick change of topic)
dialog: Anyhow, I thought she came across
dialog: great tonight. Intelligent, well
dialog: informed, a natural. And touching.
dialog: She was spectacular.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
dialog: A pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Viktor, do you realize you always
dialog: do that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Do what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Whenever I compliment Simone, you
dialog: take the credit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Yes, you do...
dialog: (shrug)
dialog: Anyway, tonight was a good start.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Excuse me? Start?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: It's a crowded summer. We need
dialog: every photo-opp, sound-byte and
dialog: column inch we can get. Good
dialog: night, Viktor.
dialog: 
text: Elaine hangs up. Lainey approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: (carefully broaching the
dialog: subject)
dialog: Mom, do you miss Dad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (she thinks)
dialog: Sometimes. But, just when I think
dialog: your father's changing for the
dialog: better, I realize he's as self
dialog: absorbed as ever. He took the
dialog: credit for Simone tonight.
dialog: 
text: Lainey, coming to her father's defense, glancing at the
text: Nietzsche book in her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: I think Dad deserves more credit
dialog: than he gets.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR watches SIMONE on screen. He is unusually anxious.
dialog: 
text: As usual SIMONE is wearing a skimpy, provocative outfit as
text: she awaits instructions on the screen. For some reason
text: Viktor becomes irritated by the image.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (to Simone)
dialog: Will you cover yourself up!?
dialog: 
text: He hits a button. A thick WOOL COAT clicks over her body.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - MORNING
dialog: 
text: The ECHO newscar streaks through the bronze and purple
text: desert. MAX and his assistant MILTON emerge from the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: -- I've been here before! -- On my
dialog: honeymoon with my ex-wife.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Is that why she left you?
dialog: 
text: Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND
text: interview. He compares her desert location to the one in
text: front of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (pointing out a Joshua
dialog: tree)
dialog: You see, that's the exact same tree
dialog: and in the distance, there's the...
dialog: (voice trailing away)
dialog: ... mountain.
dialog: 
text: Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is
text: now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
dialog: 
text: Max and Milton are mystified -- they look back at the photo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: It's a hotel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don't understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: Could they have built that hotel
dialog: since yesterday?
dialog: 
text: Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Get in the car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR has transformed his soundstage into a one-man
text: publicity machine. The floor is littered with photographs of
text: SIMONE in various states of dress and undress.
dialog: 
text: Using a sophisticated Photoshop computer program, VIKTOR
dialog: constructs magazine spreads out of numerous previous magazine
dialog: spreads -- "Time", "People", "Us", "Life", "Popular
dialog: Mechanics".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (angrily into phone)
dialog: -- We don't do the photo shoot, you
dialog: don't get the cover... written
dialog: answers to written questions,
dialog: that's right... website interviews,
dialog: no problem.
dialog: 
text: Viktor calls up a "DANCE OPTION". Choosing from a HULA
text: DANCER, a BELLY DANCER and a CLASSICAL BALLERINA, he removes
text: Simone's head and places it on the body of the ballerina.
text: She begins to dance for him.
dialog: 
dialog: He uses a program to construct childhood photographs of
text: SIMONE and other childhood memorabilia.
dialog: 
text: He employs backgrounds from numerous on-line library sources.
text: With a quick cut and paste he is able to place Simone on a
dialog: beach in San Tropez or a bicycle factory in Calcutta.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (muttering to himself)
dialog: You want exposure, Elaine? I'll
dialog: give you over-exposure...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S OFFICE - STUDIO - DAY

scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SEARCH: "NUMBER 1 HITS - FEMALE ARTISTS/BILLBOARD CHARTS"
dialog: 
dialog: PERIOD: "LAST 40 YEARS"
dialog: 
dialog: A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly

scene_heading: PATSY CLINE, ELLA FITZGERALD, ARETHA FRANKLIN, JANICE JOPLIN,

dialog: 
text: Viktor presses a button: "MORPH". The audio waves converge.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song.
text: As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also
dialog: sings. The catchy song is titled: "(If You Can't Believe In
dialog: Yourself) Believe In Me".
dialog: 
text: SIMONE APPEARS IN A MUSIC VIDEO.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RECORD STORE - DAY
dialog:

text: CLOSE UP on the name "SIMONE" painted on the stern of a
dialog: luxury yacht.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last

text: the yacht's stereo. He looks at peace.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MARINA - DAY
dialog: 
text: A TOURIST has his arm around SIMONE, having his photograph
dialog: taken. However, we discover that the Simone is only a

speaker_heading: ELVIS.
dialog: 
text: MAX SAYER and MILTON walk by.
dialog: 
text: Tying up his boat, VIKTOR's mood is abruptly shattered by the

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Nice boat, Taransky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: It's a yacht.

speaker_heading: MAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (pushing past Max)
dialog: I don't have time for this, Sayer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I think you do.
dialog: (holding up his video
dialog: print of Simone in the
dialog: desert)
dialog: I know it's a fake.
dialog: 
text: Viktor freezes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Got your attention now?
dialog: 
text: Max compares the shot to one of the current desert location
text: with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (referring to the
dialog: photographs)
dialog: It's bogus. You used an old
dialog: library shot for the background.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (ashen)
dialog: The background is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: She was never in New Mexico. She
dialog: never left the studio.
dialog: 
text: Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of faking
dialog: the background.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (referring to a large
dialog: bundle of other shots
dialog: under his arm)
dialog: I've done my homework. I've
dialog: studied her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- I bet you have.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: -- I've looked at every piece of
dialog: publicity she's ever done, the
dialog: video in the supermarket, there's
dialog: no evidence she's ever left the
dialog: studio.
dialog: (afterthought)
dialog: Oh, and for some reason this woman
dialog: leaves no paper trail. But I have
dialog: "obtained" a copy of your bank
dialog: accounts. I know you have power of
dialog: attorney but so far you haven't
dialog: transferred one single solitary
dialog: cent to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I'm keeping it in trust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I know that's what you'd like us to
dialog: believe. But I got to tell you --
dialog: embezzlement is a serious matter.
dialog: Not to mention abduction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Abduction?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I don't buy the whole recluse scam.
dialog: How are you doing it? What is it --
dialog: drugs? Blackmail? Mind-control?
dialog: All three? What do you do -- keep
dialog: her locked in a box somewhere?
dialog: 
text: Viktor flinches at the remark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I want to see her. Unless you show
dialog: me Simone live and in person I show
dialog: these pictures to the authorities.
dialog: 
text: Viktor pauses, considering the threat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Er,... good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILTON
dialog: That's good.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. CONCERT STADIUM - DUSK
dialog: 
text: A vast, empty stadium. On the stage, a lone microphone.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROMOTER
dialog: All ready, Mr. Taransky. This time
dialog: tomorrow night, she'll be standing
dialog: right here in front of a packed

dialog: twenty times.
dialog: 
dialog: Viktor nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Soundcheck went perfect. Laser
dialog: show ready to go.
dialog: (cautionary note)
dialog: I gotta say, you ordered an awful

dialog: That's the way she likes it.
dialog: 
text: The Promoter glancing to the area in front of the stage,

speaker_heading: PROMOTER
dialog: After what you told us about the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Excellent.

speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, Viktor
dialog: Taransky Promotions is proud to
dialog: present, live on stage, for the
dialog: debut concert of the "Splendid

speaker_heading: SI-MONE!
dialog: 
text: A spotlight falls on the solitary figure of Simone, standing
text: alone on the stage with a guitar over her shoulder (the only
text: accompaniment) -- dwarfed by the huge stage. However, on
text: closer inspection, the spotlight is actually a laser beam
text: creating a hologram. Clouds of smoke and strobe lighting aid
dialog: the illusion.
dialog: 
text: The only clear view of Simone for the audience is provided by
text: the enormous video screens on either side of the stage. The
text: CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that
text: they are watching a pre-recorded event. Some watch the event
dialog: on portable TVs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: It's great to be here.

scene_heading: INT. STADIUM - CONCERT STAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: SIMONE -- her voice a seamless blend of several DIVAS --

scene_heading: EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT/DAY

scene_heading: INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied
text: crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in
text: tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters
text: aloft. For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry --
text: the grand illusionist. Viktor is at the height of his
dialog: powers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (to the image of Simone on
dialog: his screen)
dialog: I don't know about you, Simone, but
dialog: I've never felt more alive.

text: Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone
dialog: stand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Damn!
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STADIUM - CROWD - NIGHT
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. CONTROL TRUCK - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: ... Simone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
text: She's lying down. She's exhausted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (suddenly cool)

speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: LAINEY

speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Where are you... going?

scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I can't believe she's doing this --
dialog: taking advantage of him this way.
dialog: It's cruel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KENT
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Obviously, this can't last. She's
dialog: going to dump him. Viktor won't be
dialog: able to take that. He's too

speaker_heading: KENT
dialog: Elaine, do you realize you can't

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Hey, Lainey.
dialog: (gently teasing her)
dialog: How's your love life?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: I do okay. How about you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You know me -- married to my work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: I noticed.
dialog: 
text: An awkward silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: Dad, you know I don't like to get

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (buoyed by the news)
dialog: Really? Too bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: She thinks you're with Simone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Lainey, you know Simone and I don't
dialog: have a real relationship.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: I know but Mom doesn't. Maybe if
dialog: it came from Simone, if Simone
dialog: spoke to Mom -- she could
dialog: straighten things out.
dialog: (shrug)
dialog: Dinner, maybe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Dinner? Dinner's difficult. A
dialog: phone call?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: Too impersonal. They have to meet
dialog: face-to-face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I'll see what I can do.
dialog: (a thought occurs)
dialog: You know, Lainey. I don't believe
dialog: you've ever once asked to meet
dialog: Simone. Don't you like her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: I love her but that doesn't mean I
dialog: need to meet her.
dialog: 
dialog: Viktor is confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: Why? So I can tell my friends at
dialog: school -- as if that validates my
dialog: life somehow. What's Simone going
dialog: to say to a fourteen-year-old
dialog: anyhow? She's going to be polite
dialog: because you're my father but we're
dialog: not suddenly going to become
dialog: friends -- we have nothing in
dialog: common. It's not going to be real.
dialog: Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in
dialog: my head every day. Why kill the
dialog: dream? What do they say, "don't
dialog: get too close to your idols, they
dialog: always disappoint you".
dialog: 
text: Viktor gazes in wonder at his daughter, so much wiser than
dialog: her years.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR

speaker_heading: LAINEY

speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Right beside you. I borrowed

dialog: 
text: Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm
dialog: late. I'm on my way to see Viktor
dialog: now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: No, I understand. That's what I
dialog: want to talk about. I don't know
dialog: if you know this, Simone, but
dialog: Viktor and I were married once.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: I can't imagine how you ever let a
dialog: man like that go. I owe Viktor
dialog: everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I think he owes more to you. But
dialog: that's not important now. I know
dialog: what's going on between you two.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: I want to reassure you, Elaine,
dialog: there's absolutely nothing going on
dialog: between Viktor and I.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (rueful smile)
dialog: You don't have to protect my
dialog: feelings, Simone. I don't blame
dialog: Viktor for falling in love with the
dialog: most desirable woman in the world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: (breaking character)
dialog: I'm not --
dialog: (correcting himself)
dialog: He's not.
dialog: 
text: Viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts across

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: My God, are you alright, Simone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: Damn --
dialog: (struggling to stay in
dialog: her/his lane)
dialog: Yes -- I --
dialog: (regaining control)
dialog: -- I'm just a little tired.
dialog: Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I --
dialog: it's strictly a working
dialog: relationship. We could never be
dialog: anything else. We're just so...
dialog: different.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Exactly. You're a household name
dialog: now. You're moving in entirely
dialog: different worlds. That's why I
dialog: hope you're not toying with Viktor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: It sounds like you still have
dialog: feelings for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: We have a daughter together. I
dialog: just don't want to see Viktor get
dialog: hurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: I don't know how many times I have
dialog: to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and
dialog: I are not in love.
dialog: (joking weakly)
dialog: I only make love to the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Simone, I recognize the shirt
dialog: you're wearing. I gave it to
dialog: Viktor on his birthday.
dialog: 
text: Over-correcting his steering, Viktor drifts into the next
text: lane, dangerously close to a pick-up truck that has to swerve
dialog: to avoid him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: Christ --
dialog: (still struggling to stay
dialog: on the road)
dialog: Elaine, I know how it looks but...
dialog: (blurting it out)
dialog: ... it would mean a lot to Viktor
dialog: if you'd go with him to the Oscars.
dialog: If you won't do it for him, please
dialog: do it for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (reluctant, frightened by
dialog: Simone's erratic driving)
dialog: Okay -- for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: (sigh of relief)
dialog: Thanks. This is my exit so, I --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I'm glad we talked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: Good-bye.
dialog: 
text: Viktor's car swerves to the right. Elaine looks back in her

dialog: feel I belong in the best actress
dialog: category let alone with these...
dialog: wonderful human beings.
dialog: (composing herself)
dialog: I also have to thank my co-stars,

speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: No, that was me.

dialog: 
text: VIKTOR leans on his desk, still reflecting on LAINEY's
text: remarks. JANE enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Ready for your casting session?
dialog: 
text: Viktor nods distractedly. Jane shows in NICOLA ANDERS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Nicola's here for the role of
dialog: Simone's sister.
dialog: 
text: Viktor offers Nicola a seat, staring at her as if he has
dialog: never truly looked at her before -- she has a quality of
dialog: Simone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: (slightly uncomfortable by
dialog: Viktor's scrutiny)
dialog: A lot's happened since we last saw
dialog: each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (numb)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: I never apologized properly for
dialog: what happened on "Sunrise".
dialog: 
text: She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike &amp;
dialog: Ike candy, including cherry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Thank you. It's not important.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: After I saw what Simone did with
dialog: the role -- you know I fired all my
dialog: people, went into rehab, took
dialog: acting classes, changed my whole
dialog: look. She really inspired me.
dialog: 
text: Viktor continues to stare.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: (referring to the script
dialog: in her hands)
dialog: Would you like me to read?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Yes, I'd like that.
dialog: 
text: Nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down.
text: She approaches Viktor, standing close to him, playing the
text: scene to him -- an immediate intimacy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: (her angry words are in
dialog: opposition to her amorous
dialog: actions)
dialog: -- Who do you think you are, Carlos
dialog: -- coming in here like this? With
dialog: my husband sleeping in the next
dialog: room. Do you think I won't call
dialog: out? Do you think I will just give
dialog: in to you without a fight -- like
dialog: the last time and the time before
dialog: that?
dialog: (she kisses his ear)
dialog: I wish you were dead.
dialog: (she kisses his lips)
dialog: I wish we were both dead.
dialog: 
text: Nicola immediately breaks character.
dialog: 
text: Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with
dialog: flesh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (finally able to speak)
dialog: You know you're really very good.
dialog: I take back what I said. I mean,
dialog: you're really good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (forgetting himself)
dialog: You could play the lead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: But that's Simone's part.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Yes, of course it is.
dialog: (gazing at her face)
dialog: You know you have a line here. Not
text: a wrinkle. Actually, more of a
dialog: dimple. I've been thinking of
dialog: incorporating something like that
dialog: in Simone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: You'd cosmetically alter Simone to
dialog: look like me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: No, of course not, you're right.
dialog: That would be crazy.
dialog: 
text: Viktor sits back down and stares out of the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLA
dialog: Do you want me to do it again?
dialog: 
text: Viktor does not reply. Nicola quietly leaves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large
text: photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via
text: satellite. However, ELAINE is gazing at a small inset
text: picture of VIKTOR, HERSELF and LAINEY arriving at the Oscar
dialog: Ceremony.
dialog: 
text: Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY (ON VIKTOR'S SCREEN)
dialog: 
text: Old home video of ELAINE. She is in a garden by a swimming
text: pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera.
text: Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera
text: operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a
dialog: kiss to the camera.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: While the ever-seductive SIMONE waits patiently on-screen for
text: Viktor's instructions, VIKTOR is gazing at the smaller
text: monitor -- the home video of ELAINE.
dialog: 
text: Viktor freezes the tape. Elaine appears particularly
dialog: beautiful.
dialog: 
text: Viktor electronically cuts out Elaine's mannerism and morphs
text: it into Simone. Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same
text: dazzling smile.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SIMONE &amp; VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Gotta go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (picking up a pile of
dialog: scripts from the in-tray)
dialog: I'm leaving early tonight. If you
dialog: need me I'll be at the beach house
dialog: having dinner with a... certain
dialog: someone.
dialog: 
text: Jane tries to conceal her interest. As soon as Viktor exits
text: the office, JANE picks up the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (into phone, under her
dialog: breath)
dialog: ... Elaine Christian please.
dialog: 
text: We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his
text: assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music. The doorbell
dialog: rings.
dialog: 
text: He checks himself in the mirror. In the reflection, he spies
text: an autographed photo of HIMSELF with his arm around SIMONE.
text: He hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door.
dialog: 
text: ELAINE stands there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Viktor, I'm picking up Lainey.
dialog: 
text: Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Elaine, it's Wednesday.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (feigning absent
dialog: mindedness)
dialog: Is it Wednesday? It's Wednesday.
dialog: How embarrassing. I don't know
dialog: what I was thinking. With all the
dialog: excitement lately...
dialog: (peering past him)
dialog: Am I interrupting something? Are
dialog: you expecting company?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (ushering her inside)
dialog: As a matter-of-fact I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: When is she coming over?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (glancing to his watch)
dialog: About now. Would you like a drink?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I suppose I could stay, just until
dialog: she arrives.
dialog: 
text: Elaine takes a seat on the sofa. Viktor hands her a glass of
text: wine and sits beside her -- close.
dialog: 
text: They both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both
dialog: apparently in need of courage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (trying to make
dialog: conversation)
dialog: Is Simone back to earth yet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Not quite.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I'm sure you'll keep her focussed.
dialog: She's lucky to have you, Viktor.
dialog: (blurting out)
dialog: Is she really having your baby?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Impossible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (instantly regretting the
dialog: remark)
dialog: I just read somewhere --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I know. I know. They'll say
dialog: anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: -- And she was positively glowing
dialog: at the awards.
dialog: (making to leave)
dialog: I should be going, she'll be here
dialog: soon --
dialog: 
text: Viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- She already is. Simone's not
dialog: coming over, Elaine. Not tonight,
dialog: not ever.
dialog: (holding her)
dialog: I want you back, Elaine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (melting)
dialog: I want you back too, Viktor.
dialog: 
text: They kiss. Elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed with
dialog: doubt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: This is crazy. Who am I fooling?
dialog: I can't compete with Simone. What
dialog: woman can?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I would rather have you than
dialog: Simone. Believe me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: That's sweet, Viktor, but I
dialog: couldn't let you do that -- make
dialog: that kind of sacrifice.
dialog: (meeting his gaze)
dialog: It's strange. I've stabbed people
dialog: in the back, clawed and slept my
dialog: way to where I am -- it goes with
dialog: the territory -- but, for some
dialog: reason, I can't betray Simone.
dialog: There's... I don't know any other
dialog: way to say it -- there's a goodness
dialog: to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: No, there isn't. There's nothing
dialog: to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Oh, Viktor. You say that now --
dialog: because we're here, alone, like
dialog: this. But in the morning, you'd go
dialog: back to her. What man wouldn't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: No, I will end my relationship with
dialog: her -- totally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: But you don't understand. She'll
dialog: always be there -- at some party,
dialog: on some magazine cover, some song
text: on the radio, up on some screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: No. She'll never work again --
dialog: retire, never make a movie or a
dialog: record, or appear ever again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Of course she will. Her public
dialog: will demand it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Not if I don't let her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You?
dialog: 
text: Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I'm going to tell you a secret now,
dialog: Elaine.
dialog: (mustering all his nerve)
dialog: Simone is not a real person. I
dialog: invented her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (misinterpreting his
dialog: remark)
dialog: Every actor is an invention,
dialog: Viktor. Don't embarrass yourself.
dialog: No one's denying that you
dialog: discovered Simone. But it's like
text: finding a diamond in the desert.
dialog: Anyone can trip over it, but it's
dialog: not the finder who sparkles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: -- No, no, I didn't trip over her.
dialog: You don't understand --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: -- You just got lucky that she's
dialog: loyal enough to stay with you.
dialog: Maybe she's staying out of pity,
dialog: who knows? She certainly doesn't
dialog: need you. Some people even say
dialog: you're holding her back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (wounded)
dialog: Who says that -- ?
dialog: (shaking off the insult)
dialog: -- Never mind. You have to listen
dialog: to me, Elaine. Simone is thin air,
dialog: pixels, molded by me from a
dialog: mathematical equation. I inherited
dialog: it from a madman -- I can show
dialog: you --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: How much wine have you had?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: -- She's a figment of my own
dialog: imagination. I, Viktor Taransky,
dialog: have perpetrated the greatest hoax,
dialog: the greatest sleight-of-hand,
dialog: sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of-
dialog: sleight in entertainment history!
dialog: And still no one appreciates me,
dialog: recognizes what I've done -- even
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (rolling her eyes)
dialog: You're drunker than I thought. Are
dialog: you doing that again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: No! Whatever talent Simone has
dialog: comes from me -- me! Me! I swear,
dialog: as God is my judge. You don't know
dialog: what I've been through. Tens of
dialog: thousands of mind-numbing hours in
dialog: front of that screen, nights
dialog: without end, and look what it's
dialog: cost me.
dialog: (producing his spectacles)
dialog: Why do you think I've been wearing
dialog: these? I may have done irreparable
dialog: harm to my eyesight, and why? To
dialog: extract and refine the infinite
dialog: nuances of a human being -- a human
dialog: soul.
dialog: (a final explanation)
dialog: Don't you see? I made Simone!
dialog: 
text: A pause. His words hang in the air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You made Simone?
dialog: (a trace of pity)
dialog: Viktor, she made you.
dialog: 
text: Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor
text: alone in his house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: A hung-over VIKTOR enters his office. Suddenly, he stops and
text: confronts the standee of SIMONE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You bitch! I'll destroy you!
dialog: 
text: JANE stares in shock. She discreetly exits.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at
text: SIMONE. He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
dialog: 
text: A) Peering through a gap in the drapes of his Malibu house,
text: VIKTOR watches MAX dig through his trash. Max finds a
text: beat up reel of 16mm film.
dialog: 
text: MAX holds the end up to the light -- his eyes pop.
dialog: 
text: B) The ECHO headline screams, "SIMONE'S HARD CORE PAST" and
text: shows censored film frames of a naked Simone in a
dialog: compromising position.
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR, hovering at a supermarket check-out line,
text: overhears two WOMEN discussing the article.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN 1
dialog: Disgusting...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN 2
dialog: (sympathetic)
dialog: She must have been so desperate to
dialog: do something like that, so
dialog: depraved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN 1
dialog: I'm still naming my baby after her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN 2
dialog: You're having a boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN 1
dialog: So?
dialog: 
text: Viktor blanches. It is not the reaction he'd hoped for.
dialog: 
text: C) Inside a theater, VIKTOR hovers by the door, smirking.
dialog: 
text: ON SCREEN, we hear a farmyard scene -- SIMONE in an empty
text: farmyard on all fours, grunting like a pig, and foraging
dialog: for muddy vegetables.
dialog: 
text: The AUDIENCE is shocked, then suddenly breaks into
dialog: spontaneous applause.
dialog: 
text: Viktor, enraged, exits into the lobby past the poster for
dialog: "I AM PIG - Starring Simone".
dialog: 
text: D) A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera, a film poster
dialog: behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FILM CRITIC
dialog: For Simone to do something as brave
dialog: as "I AM PIG" at this point in her
dialog: career, with so much to lose -- all
dialog: I can say is, "I Am Pig, I Am
dialog: Oscar".
dialog: 
text: E) In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds
text: wrinkles to Simone.
dialog: 
text: F) SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote
text: on a TV screen. However, her squeaky-clean image has
text: gone -- hair unkempt, bloated, chain-smoking and drinking
text: during the interview. The HOSTS are smiling weakly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Simone, that's a rather
dialog: controversial position.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: I just think all elementary schools
dialog: should have a firing range -- so
dialog: students can learn how to defend
dialog: themselves. We could fit it
dialog: inbetween recess and American

dialog: crowded enough?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOSTS
dialog: Just as we always knew. Simone's
dialog: not like other celebrities. She
dialog: speaks her mind!
dialog: 
text: G) VIKTOR driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his
text: brakes, almost causing an accident. He stares numbly up
text: at a twenty-foot high smiling photo of Simone on a
text: billboard featuring a huge cover of TIME MAGAZINE. It
text: reads, "SIMONE: WOMAN OF THE YEAR".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: She's trying to kill me.
dialog: 
text: Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
dialog: 
text: An inscription on a headstone reads:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANK ALENO
dialog: Remembered Virtually Forever
dialog: 
text: VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave. He places a bunch of flowers
dialog: there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: (referring to the flowers)
dialog: They're plastic, Hank. I know
dialog: that's the way you'd want it.
dialog: (glancing to a Simone
dialog: billboard outside the
dialog: cemetery wall)
dialog: She killed you, Hank. Now she's
dialog: killing me. She's a serial killer.
dialog: (ducking out of sight of
dialog: the billboard as if
dialog: Simone is watching him)
dialog: But I don't know how to stop her.
text: She's taken on a life of her own.
dialog: I can't just come clean -- make
dialog: some confession. I've defrauded
dialog: millions -- they'd turn on me. And
dialog: I can't put the genie back in the
dialog: bottle. If she stopped working --
dialog: dropped out of sight, they'd never
dialog: let it rest. I've tried to kill
dialog: her career but they like her even
dialog: more.
dialog: (more desperate)
dialog: What am I going to do, Hank?
dialog: 
text: A thought occurs to Viktor. He slowly rises from behind
text: Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Don't say another word, Hank. You
dialog: are truly a genius.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VIKTOR'S SOUNDSTAGE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor,
text: SIMONE's face full screen.
dialog: 
text: He speaks into the voice synthesizer, Simone's face
text: automatically speaking the words he speaks -- the final time
text: he puts his words in her mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMONE / VIKTOR
dialog: What's the matter, Viktor? You
dialog: look so sad. Don't you love me
dialog: anymore?... It's over, isn't it?
dialog: 
text: He switches off the synthesizer and speaks in his own voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: It's the only way, Simone. If it's
dialog: any consolation, you're going to
dialog: live on in the public's heart like
dialog: all the other tragic figures that
dialog: went before their time. There's no
dialog: love like posthumous love.
dialog: 
text: On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I know what you're thinking. It's
dialog: a phoney-baloney world. The women
dialog: are surgically enhanced, the
dialog: athletes are on steroids, the
dialog: singers are lip-syncing if they're
dialog: even singing at all, the news is
dialog: entertainment, the politicians are
dialog: bought and paid for -- we're living
dialog: one big lie. So why shouldn't you
dialog: live too? You're more authentic
dialog: than the people who adore you.
dialog: (a trace of despair)
dialog: And that's the problem. You're
dialog: looking at the real fraud. I told
dialog: myself this was all about the work
dialog: but if that was the truth, it
dialog: wouldn't matter to me -- and it
dialog: does. It wasn't that the artists
dialog: had no respect for the art. They
dialog: had no respect for me. Someone
dialog: like you, you have so much love
dialog: showered on you -- I just wanted to
dialog: feel one tiny drop on my face. I'm
dialog: sorry, Simone. Here I've been
dialog: trying to convince the world that
dialog: you exist, but I was really trying
dialog: to convince them that I exist.
dialog: It's not that you aren't human,
dialog: Simone, it's that I am.
dialog: 
text: Viktor produces a disc from his jacket marked, "PLAGUE - Ver.
text: 8.1". He places the disc in the machine.
dialog: 
text: Viktor sees that Simone is crying. He touches a tear on his
text: own face and realizes her tears are in response to his own.
dialog: 
text: Viktor hesitates -- a moment of doubt -- then presses
text: "ENTER". The image of SIMONE's face gradually begins to
text: deconstruct -- pixel by pixel -- as the virus takes hold.
text: The pixels collect into a pile at the bottom of his screen
text: like dust. Finally, the dust is blown away in a single
dialog: digital breath.
dialog: 
text: For a moment his attention is taken with a layer of dust on
dialog: his own desk.
dialog: 
text: Viktor regards his own reflection in the now black screen.
text: His hard-drive now corrupted, he picks up his original disc
text: marked, "SIMULATION ONE".
dialog: 
text: He tosses this disc into a steamer trunk he has loaded with
text: hundreds of discs relating to Simone's software. He shuts

speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Oh, no. The fan club is real. But

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: So, of course, you couldn't kill

dialog: Of course.

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: The woman you admitted to a

speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: She's insane! This whole thing is
dialog: insane! There is no Simone. Look!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Why don't you just come clean,

dialog: feel better afterwards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I am telling the truth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: (coming close to him)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: God, it's so like your father. Why
dialog: can't people take responsibility
dialog: for their actions anymore? I can
dialog: almost forgive him for killing
dialog: Simone -- but denying her
dialog: existence. I can never forgive
dialog: that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAINEY
dialog: Because obviously she existed,
dialog: right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I know it as surely as you're
dialog: sitting here, sweetheart. She was

dialog: -- honestly, I haven't. I mean, it
dialog: feels like I have. I know more
dialog: about her than members of my own
dialog: family. She's even in my dreams.
dialog: But I realized, going back through
dialog: my diary, they were all TV
dialog: appearances, near misses at
dialog: parties, second-hand rumor, gossip
dialog: on the internet. I've never
dialog: actually seen Simone up close,

dialog: presence. Have you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (unable to refute it)
dialog: Well, I --

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (trying to shake the

dialog: Lainey, there's no evidence that

dialog: What?!

speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: It was premeditated -- I knew
