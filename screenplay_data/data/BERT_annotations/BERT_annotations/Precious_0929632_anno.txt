scene_heading: 1 EXT HARLEM STREET ­ DAY 1
text: A COLD WIND blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street
dialog: lamp.
text: An iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection. A
text: stray dog investigates it briefly, urinates and then moves on.
text: A book bag drops onto the pavement.
text: Visible from the waist down, a LARGE YOUNG WOMAN in a
text: disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and
text: then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk.
text: Once finished, her thick hands wipe each other until they
text: stop abruptly.
text: Here, for the first time, we see her PLUMP, YOUTHFUL, VACANT
scene_heading: AFRICAN AMERICAN FACE. It is 16-YEAR-OLD PRECIOUS JONES.
text: Something inside the bin has caught her attention.
text: Precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book
text: as the breath from her nostrils steams. The title of the book
text: staring back up at her is unintelligible.
text: She pushes debris aside to get to it.
text: The book plunges deeper into the trash, as if trying to flee.
text: The sound of an ONCOMING CAR approaches.
text: Precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the
text: sounds of the oncoming car close in.
text: Precious finally comes up with the book. Its title is still
text: unintelligible. When she flips it over, however, the letters
text: on the cover, which are facing us now, make sense. They read
scene_heading: CRYSTAL STAIR: SELECTED WORKS BY LANGSTON HUGHES.

text: The car sounds incredibly close.
text: Precious looks sharply to her left.
text: AN EERIE SKID precedes an eerier THUD! Precious, almost hit,
text: falls back on to the pavement as her book skips across the
text: intersection and down into a drain.
text: She lays on the sidewalk pressed against the base of the
text: street lamp with her eyes closed.
text: The car reverses, skids, stops for a sec, shifts and
text: SCREECHES off.
text: The garbage bin, overturned yet again, rocks side to side
text: until settling, to a stop.
text: An ambulance eases up to the intersection.
text: When the stoplight changes, the ambulance motors past
text: Precious in no hurry. A moment later, its sirens BLARE and it
text: speeds off into the distance.
text: The stray dog returns, re-investigates the garbage bin, and
text: turns to Precious. He licks her face. Tom Cruise walks up to
dialog: her.
text: Precious' still vacant eyes finally open to see Tom, and the
text: red scarf falling from the street lamp towards her. Tom gives
