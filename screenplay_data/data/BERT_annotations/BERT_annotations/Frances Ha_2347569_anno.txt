text: Sophie sings and plays a shitty guitar badly. Frances
dialog: dances.
text: When people walk by, they both stop and yell:
speaker_heading: FRANCES AND SOPHIE

dialog: Usually a creepy guy.
speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: FRANCES AND SOPHIE

speaker_heading: FRANCES

text: Frances is reading and Sophie is knitting. 7
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Oh, this is interesting.
text: She reads a sentence out loud from “Sincerity and
text: Authenticity” by Lionel Trilling. Sophie nods.
text: Sophie works out to a video in the tiny living room. 8
text: Frances half watches.
text: Frances and Sophie smoke in two separate adjacent 9

speaker_heading: FRANCES (V.O.)
dialog: (doing a Jamaican accent)
dialog: Okay, my father is from Jamaica,
dialog: mon, and--
dialog: (doing an Irish accent)
dialog: --my mother is from Ireland.
dialog: (trying to combine the accents)
dialog: So I talk like this...
text: They both crack up.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (V.O.)
dialog: (doing a Russian accent)
dialog: My mother is from Russia and--
dialog: (doing a Southern accent)
dialog: --and my father is from Alabama.
dialog: (trying to combine)
dialog: So I talk like this.
text: They play a game together. 10A
text: They do their laundry at the laundromat across the 11

text: quietly puts the computer away.
text: Frances makes a move out of the bed.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (eyes closed)
dialog: Don’t be stupid.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I should sleep in my own bed.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Because I bought it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Stay. But take off your socks.
speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: PART ONE:
text: CLOSE on a photo of a bony, bug-eyed cat that resembles 13
text: an alien.
speaker_heading: FRANCES (0.S.)
dialog: It’s hairless?
speaker_heading: DAN (0.S.)
dialog: No, it has fine curly hair.
text: CLOSE on Frances looking down. She looks up briefly,
text: attempts a smile and looks back down.
text: CLOSE on her hand touching the back of her neck.
text: She stares at a photograph in her lap.
text: She is wearing dance clothes underneath a knit dress, and
text: her hair is pulled back. A bulky canvas backpack sits
dialog: beside her. She’ll have it the whole film.
text: CLOSE on her fingers smoothing the skin on her arm.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (excited)
dialog: There’s this house in Westchester,
dialog: the basement is all Cornish Rexes,
text: it smells awful, the top floor is
dialog: Siamese cats.
text: She nods and hands Dan, early 30’s, back the photo. He
text: sits opposite her on a thrift-store couch, a manilla
text: envelope in his lap.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I’m allergic to cats.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: They're hypo-allergenic.
dialog: (quick smile)
dialog: This is a special Frances kitty.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Oh...who knew?
text: He passes her back a photo.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: This one is the runt. Which is
dialog: cheaper but I think is the best one
dialog: anyway. I figured one runt and one
dialog: regular?
text: Frances hesitates.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I put a hundred dollar down payment
dialog: on each cat...or eighty for the
dialog: runt and a hundred for the other
dialog: one.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Why not get one cat?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: A cat needs a buddy. If you get
dialog: one cat you need to get two cats.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I‘1l give you two hundred dollars
dialog: to get no cats.
text: He nods, somewhat hurt and annoyed, glances back at the
text: photo of the runt, starts stacking the photos and tucking
text: them back into the envelope. Frances comes over and sits
text: next to him, puts her hand on his back.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: So, who will take care of them if
dialog: you go away?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I thought...we’d get them together.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: And move them back and forth
dialog: between our apartments?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: No...I thought maybe you could move
dialog: in with me...
text: Frances hesitates.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (strangely)
dialog: Oh, wow...
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Do you want to move in with me?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I mean, I do have this other thing.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: What “other thing?”
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Well...I don’t know. I promised
dialog: Sophie I'd stay through the lease.
text: He sighs deeply.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Is that bad? I’m sorry. I feel
dialog: bad.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Can’t she find someone else?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yeah. But, it’s my friend...
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I want to move in with you.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I feel bad.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Don’t feel bad. Forget it.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: No...
dialog: (off his expression)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: You're mad.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I’m not mad. I’m disappointed.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I feel bad.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Stop feeling bad, Frances! I asked
dialog: you to move in, you said, No.
text: Her phone rings.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: But I can’t.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You can, you don’t want to.
text: She looks at her phone.
dialog: She does.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: It’s okay, I don’t need to get it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: It’s Sophie. I’11 call her back.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Just pick up the phone.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Do you mind?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Answer it.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (into phone, a voice)
dialog: Hey girl...waz up wid you? Where
dialog: you at?...I can’t come now...
dialog: (laugh)
dialog: Are you drunk?...I can’t...I love
dialog: you...
text: Dan watches her without expression. He gets up and gets
text: a beer from the fridge.
dialog: She hangs
dialog: He drinks
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Dumpling house!...I love you...I
dialog: can’t really talk now...I love
dialog: you...Okay!...I love you.
text: up and looks at him somewhat sheepishly.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: She's with Benji and Lev at this
dialog: party in Chinatown.
dialog: (pause)
text: They’re drunk.
dialog: his beer.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I don’t know...maybe this isn’t
dialog: working.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (a new idea)
dialog: Maybe...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I do want to pay you for the cats.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I’m not going to take money from
dialog: you. But I’m going to get the cats
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: But then you’re going to be a
text: single guy with two cats.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Why...why am I going to be single?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
text: With two cats.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: No, I know. I mean why would I be
dialog: single?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I don’t know... I thought you said
dialog: this wasn’t working. I mean, if we
dialog: don’t move in together. If we
dialog: can’t move in together.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We can move in together.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I don’t know...I don’t know if I
dialog: believe anything I’m saying.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: This hasn’t been great for a while.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (nods )
dialog: This hasn’t been great for a while.
dialog: This has not...
text: She looks at him sadly. Frances puts on a too-big bomber
dialog: jacket, not really cool, just something a friend gave her
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I guess home. I’m really tired. I’m
dialog: always so tired.
text: She puts on her backpack.
speaker_heading: DAN

text: Lev plays a record. He tries very hard to flirt with
dialog: Frances.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I can't get interested in art or

text: Animals in conversation. The
dialog: animals have to talk or be at war
dialog: for me to be interested.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION. NIGHT 15
text: No one is on the platform. Frances pulls down her pants
text: and pees into the tracks, holding onto the pillar to

text: Sophie looks for a train. She turns to see--
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (laughing)

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I want a sip.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Do you want your own?
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I want a sip.
text: Frances reluctantly hands it over.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: The coffee people are right. We are
dialog: like a lesbian couple that doesn’t
dialog: have sex anymore.
text: Sophie hands it back and exits frame.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Wait! Come back!
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (0.S.)
dialog: Don’t pick at your face.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (kind of to herself,
dialog: touching a pimple)
dialog: I don’t like smoking alone.
text: She puts out her own cigarette and follows Sophie to the
text: bedroom. Sophie is writing an email on her phone.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Me and Dan don’t have sex
dialog: anymore...didn’t have sex anymore.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Yeah, that’s why you broke up.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Or if it happened then he would
dialog: just - he only had one way that he
dialog: could finish.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I hate that.
text: 18 Sophie enters the bathroom. Washes her face. 18
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: It was always with me facing flat
text: on the bed from behind. Which
dialog: just...everything that matters was
dialog: covered up.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It’s like with me and Patch -
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (making fun)
dialog: Yo Patchy!
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (also making fun)
dialog: ‘Sup bra?
dialog: (continue, matter of fact)
dialog: The way he always likes to come in
dialog: my face.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yeah, CLASSY. Patch is the kind of
dialog: dude who says “I gotta take a
dialog: leak.”
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (cringing)
dialog: And wears pre-distressed baseball
dialog: hats. But...he’s a nice guy...for
dialog: today.
text: Frances joins Sophie in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I should feel bad that I went to
dialog: the party.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You deserved it. You just got out
dialog: of relationship jail.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I think Dan was an alcoholic.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: He was.
text: Sophie leaves frame.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: He wasn’t a real alcoholic.
text: Frances leaves frame.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: But sometimes he would have twelve
dialog: beers.
text: 19 Sophie lies in bed. She’s still typing on her phone. 19
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Stop playing on your phone.
dialog: 13.
text: Frances flops down into bed next to her.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It’s the only thing with interweb
dialog: in this house. I have to answer
dialog: work emails.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: The neighbors changed their code.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (re: her phone)
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Lev is asking for your number.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Give it to him!
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (not judgemental)
dialog: You did just break up with Dan
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Just do it.
text: She types in the number. Frances gets her phone from a
text: bag and stares at it. Waiting. Sophie goes back to typing
text: on her phone.
text: Frances’ phone chirps. Reads out loud.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: “Ahoy sexy. Are you around this
dialog: week?” Ahoy sexy?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: That is actually very gay.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Am I nautically sensual?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You’re funny.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Lev didn’t laugh at any of my jokes
dialog: tonight.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You are SO funny.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Should I text back “Starboard anal
dialog: sex?”
text: Sophie laughs. Puts her phone down. Snuggles down in bed.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (settling)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Tell me the story of us...
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Again? Well, Frances, we are going

speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: COLLEEN

speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Sometimes there is, for a second...
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: What is going on with that phone,
dialog: lady?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I didn’t want to do it without
dialog: knowing it was okay with you first.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (putting her phone away)
dialog: I want to move into this apartment

dialog: if you’re not okay with it --
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Oh --
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: But they need to know by tomorrow.

speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I sort of thought we were going to
dialog: renew the lease.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Yeah, but we never talked about it.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I could have moved in with Dan.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Not if you broke up.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: That’s why we broke up.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It’s LITERALLY on my favorite
dialog: street. Phoebe said it was too good
dialog: to pass up.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: You hate Phoebe.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: She’s okay.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: We make fun of her.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Then go for it.
dialog: Revision (05/14/2012) 20.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: We're both really clean.
speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I wish it was going to be with you.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Is this train skipping DeKalb?
text: She gets up to look at the subway map.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: We could look for another place

dialog: really hard to find stuff in the
dialog: West Village.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I can’t afford the West Village.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I know it’s so expensive. My raise
dialog: just barely covers the rent.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: You should take the place.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I’m not leaving you - I’m just
dialog: moving neighborhoods.
text: Frances’s eyes well up.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE

dialog: It‘’ll drain the blood out.

speaker_heading: FRANCES
text: I look like I’m asking a question.

scene_heading: INT. FRANCES AND SOPHIE'S APARTMENT. DAYS LATER. MORNING 30
text: Frances gets a tea bag out and puts it in a mug. She

text: Not finding a kettle, she boils water in a saucepan.
text: While she’s waiting for the water to boil, she lights a
dialog: cigarette.
text: The apartment is nearly empty. It turns out Sophie had
text: most of the furniture and Frances had most of the books.
text: It looks like the crack den of a pretty well educated
dialog: junkie.
text: The water boils. Frances tries to pour it into the mug,
text: but scalds herself. She kicks the kitchen cabinet.
text: Frances is on the phone. She moves.
speaker_heading: FRANCES

scene_heading: EXT. BANK. DAY. MOMENTS LATER 32
text: Frances leaves the bank. Is still elated. Looks around,

speaker_heading: FRANCES
text: Motorcycles are so loud.
speaker_heading: LEV

speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I’m sorry, I had so much trouble
dialog: finding --
text: She casually picks up the last bit of her wine and downs

speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: What the fuck?
text: She tries to trace the blood up her arm to its source.
speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: You're bleeding.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I can’t find it.
speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: Somewhere on your arm...

speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I know, but I’m fine.
text: He places the bandage on her arm.
speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: There.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Like a boy scout... Sophie makes
dialog: fun of me because I can’t account
dialog: for my bruises. We’re not living
dialog: together anymore.
speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yeah, I’m going to have to find a
dialog: place to live. I can’t afford to
dialog: stay there alone. I was kind of

speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: Nope.
text: They are quiet a little too long. Lev moves towards her

dialog: is definitely negative.
dialog: It’s something that if she had thought about for one
dialog: second more that she wouldn’t have done.
text: Lev moves away.

speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: Nope. $1200.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I...I don’t, I thought we said $950

speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: Nope. The whole space is $4000 but
dialog: the little room is only $1200
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: But, I --
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: No, she’s right. We said she could

speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Remember because when I do the

speaker_heading: FRANCES

dialog: awesome.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I thought we were both broke!

speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Until then, it’s after three. I can

speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Movies are so expensive now...I
dialog: should be saving so I can pay full
dialog: rent.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I’m not going to force you.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (getting up, ready)

speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: BENJI

speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: He doesn’t get along with his
dialog: dad...Lev and Benji are artists.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Exactly -- the only people who can
dialog: afford to be artists in New York
dialog: are rich.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I’m an artist. I’m not rich.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: FRANCES

dialog: Everyone who comes here loves it. I

speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: I need to clean up. Ladies.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Bye!
text: Lev retreats into his bedroom.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Lev would totally date you.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I have a boyfriend.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: But isn’t he charming? And so
dialog: handsome? You could be over here
dialog: all the time, it would be GREAT.
dialog: You wouldn’t have to spend all that
dialog: time with Phoebe.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Right, I could fuck him just to not
dialog: hang out with Phoebe!
text: Lev walks across the living room in just a towel.
speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: Don’t mind me. I’m just trying to
dialog: get your attention.
text: Lev goes into the bathroom. The shower turns on.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: How could you not want to date him?
dialog: He’s kind of magic.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Because I’m with Patch.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Patch is the kind of guy who buys a
dialog: black leather couch and is like “I
dialog: love it.”
text: Sophie doesn’t react. Frances gets up. Starts trying to
dialog: do a headstand.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: What are we doing with our day?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I have to get going around five, so
dialog: I guess I should leave at --
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I thought we were hanging out.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: We are.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: All day.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I have plans with Patch tonight. I
dialog: told you.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I don’t remember that.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I texted that to you.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: No you didn’t.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Yes I did. Here --
text: Sophie gets out her phone, starts scrolling.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: We're not doing that. That’s
dialog: shitty. It’s not court.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I did text you, though.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I believe you.
dialog: 55
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You don’t have to believe me, I did
dialog: text you.
text: She holds out her phone.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Do you want to see my room?
scene_heading: INT. FRANCES’S ROOM 55
text: Sophie and Frances in her room. They flop down on the
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I kind of have a crush on this boy,
dialog: but his name is Georgie so I don’t
dialog: know how far it’s going to go.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Can't fuck a Georgie.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: “I want you inside me Georgie.”
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Have you been dating anyone?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Oh, Frances.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: It’s fine.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What about Benji?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Benji thinks I’m undateable. It’s
dialog: really funny when he does it.
dialog: (indicating her and Sophie)
dialog: You and I are both undateable. Guys
dialog: can’t handle us. We are going to be
dialog: spinsters.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Better break that to Patch.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Boys are easier. Girls are passive
dialog: aggressive, boys are just like
dialog: “clean up your shit.”
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: You're still messy...
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I’ve been busy.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: No, it wasn’t a criticism, I meant
dialog: it in a nice way. You will always
dialog: be messy and you will always look
dialog: at yourself too much in the mirror.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: When do I look at myself in the
dialog: mirror?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Always -- you just were doing it.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: There are so many mirrors in this
dialog: apartment!
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I don’t want you to change. I like
dialog: your clothes everywhere and your
dialog: mirror thing -- it’s sweet.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: You have stuff, too.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: You judge people who aren’t as
dialog: moderate as you are.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I do not.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yes you do. And you don’t read.
text: Just then, Benji comes running into the room and leaps
text: into bed with them.
dialog: 56
dialog: 57
dialog: 58
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Hey bitches!
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Oh my God, Benji! You're crazy!
text: CUT TO: It’s night. Benji and Frances watch a movie. 56
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: I wish we had cookies.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I wish we had Chessmen.
text: The front door opens. Lev and a dark haired, long legged
text: girl enter. Different girl than Nessa.
speaker_heading: LEV
dialog: Hey guys.
dialog: (to girl)
dialog: Wanna see my room?
text: They walk in front of the TV and into his room.
scene_heading: INT. THEATRE. NIGHT. 57

text: Colleen comes in.
speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: You looked great tonight.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Thanks!
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Frances, I wanted to tell you so
dialog: you had some days to process it -
dialog: we won’t be able to use you in the
dialog: Christmas show. I’m really sorry.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: What?
dialog: 59
dialog: 60
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I’m really sorry -- you know what
dialog: bad shape the company is in.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (tearing up)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: We can talk about next steps when
dialog: we're back in February.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Am I fired?
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: No! I just, I like you and I want
dialog: to talk to you about the future and
dialog: make sure it’s what you want.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I want to be in the company.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I know.
text: Frances is crushed.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Take your time.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yeah. I will. I can’t help it.
scene_heading: INT. THEATRE. NIGHT. 59
text: Frances walks across the deserted stage. Takes a self-
text: consciously sad moment.
scene_heading: INT. THEATRE LOBBY. NIGHT. MOMENTS LATER. 60
text: Most people are gone. A few stragglers remain.
text: Frances sees Sophie. Runs to her, hugs her.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: Oh, my love, I’m so glad you’re
dialog: here!
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You were great, really great.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Could you see me?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Yeah, we were on the risers, so we
text: could see to the back.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Who?
text: Patch walks up.
speaker_heading: PATCH
dialog: Sorry, I had to take a leak.
dialog: Congratulations!
text: Frances face hardens.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Thank you.
text: Patch doesn’t pick up on anything.
speaker_heading: PATCH
dialog: Should we all go out for a quick
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: A “quick” drink?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: We have to get up early tomorrow.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Tomorrow is Saturday.
speaker_heading: PATCH
dialog: We have to catch a flight in the
dialog: morning -- we’re meeting my parents
dialog: in the Galapagos.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (trying to connect to Frances)
dialog: I haven’t packed. You know me.
speaker_heading: PATCH
dialog: Last Minute Mabel.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Ronald Rule Follower.
text: They are doing a routine. He does this weird kind of

text: strangled. Frances just stares at them.
dialog: 61
dialog: 62
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: INT. BAR. NIGHT. 61
text: Frances, Patch and Sophie sit in a corner. It’s kind of a
dialog: douche-y club/bar.
text: The waitress comes up.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I’ll have a glass of --
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: -- We’ll get a bottle of your most
dialog: expensive vodka for the table. And
dialog: then all the stuff that comes with
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Very good.
text: She leaves. Patch laughs and rubs his hands together
dialog: uncomfortably.
scene_heading: INT. BAR. NIGHT. LATER. 62
text: Frances is doing shots. Patch and Sophie sip on their
dialog: drinks.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (very drunk)
dialog: I want us to be a family, you know?
dialog: I can be part of your family, don’t
dialog: you think? Patch I love you. I want
dialog: to love you. But I need you to get
dialog: drunk.
text: The waitress comes back.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: How are we doing over here.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: We're good. Bring the check, we'll
dialog: finish the bottle. Sophie?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Sophie come with me.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Where?
dialog: 63
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Bathroom.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Really? Are we still doing this?
text: Frances is pulling Sophie away.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Patch, you got this?
speaker_heading: PATCH
dialog: Um, yep.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT. 63
text: Frances and Sophie inside a stall together. Frances sits
text: on the toilet.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I was lying. I don’t love Patch.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I do love him.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Since when? When did this happen?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It’s been happening.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
text: That’s fucking BULLSHIT. SOPHIE.
speaker_heading: COME ON.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: No, you're bullshit. And you're
dialog: making me feel really bad right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I want to love him if you love him
dialog: but you don’t love him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
speaker_heading: I DO.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (tearing up)
dialog: SOPHIE. I fucking held your head
dialog: when you cried I bought special
dialog: milk for you I know where you hide
dialog: your pills do not treat me like a
text: three hour brunch friend.
dialog: 64
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I’m not talking to you while you’re
dialog: like this.
text: Frances hits the wall close to Sophie’s head. It’s
dialog: violent and kind of scary.
scene_heading: INT. BAR. NIGHT. MOMENTS LATER. 64
text: Sophie two steps ahead of Frances, rushing back to the
text: table. She starts gathering her things. So does Frances.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (to Patch)
dialog: We have to go.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I’m going.
speaker_heading: PATCH
dialog: (to Sophie)
dialog: We can stay if you want.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I’M GOING.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (to Patch)
dialog: C’mon, get your stuff.
text: Frances gets angry.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
text: NO I’M GOING. YOU FUCKING SIT DOWN.
text: They sit.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (putting on a act)
dialog: Enjoy the Galapagos. I am also
text: going on a vacation. A long one.
dialog: I‘1l set up my email so it sends
dialog: out a vacation email. And my
dialog: voicemail will also say I’m on
dialog: vacation. So if you get that,
dialog: Sophie, don’t worry, I’m ona
dialog: vacation. I’ll try to give you a
dialog: call when I get back, okay? Thanks,
dialog: guys. This was great.
text: Frances shoves the bottle of vodka into her purse and
text: takes off.
dialog: 65
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: INT. FRANCES ROOM. NIGHT. 65
text: The bottle of vodka that Frances took is sitting on her
text: dresser. All the lights are on. Frances is visibly
text: upset. She is putting away all the clothes in her room,
text: trying to straighten up, make a neatness.
text: She looks at herself in the mirror for one second,
text: catches herself doing it, and looks away.
text: Benji appears in the door watching her.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: You're cleaning!
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: I’m not messy, I’m busy!
text: Benji is inside the room. He sits on the bed. Frances
text: looks at it, discouraged.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I don’t make my bed. Sophie always
dialog: made the bed.
text: She keeps cleaning.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I’m glad you’re home. I had a
dialog: shitty night.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Sorry kid. I had a great night. I
dialog: cracked the second act of my
dialog: script. I’m on page 68.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: That's exciting. Is that for SNL?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: No, this is s sample script I’m
dialog: writing for the fourth Beverly
dialog: Hills Cop.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Boy trouble tonight?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Sophie trouble...
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Undateable.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: And I kind of, I don’t know, I got
dialog: temporarily fired.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I’ve been fired like a million
dialog: times! It makes you cool!
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (dejected)
dialog: Yeah. But without the Christmas
dialog: show, I can’t pay...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Do you have any good tunes?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: (clearly pleased)
dialog: Wait right there!
text: He gets his iPod and big headphones. He puts them on her.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: It’s a jammer.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (too loudly)
dialog: It's great.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I know.
text: He does that thing where he looks at her too intensely
text: while she’s listening, trying to figure out what part of
text: the song she’s on. She takes them off.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I love it. Put it on my mix.
text: He puts the headphones back on, wanting her to listen to
dialog: the song.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Aren’t these headphones tits? I
dialog: just got them. They’re super-duper
dialog: noise cancelling. So I don’t have
dialog: to hear Lev fuck.
dialog: She takes them off again--
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Ha.
text: --he tries to push them back on, she shoves them back to
text: him and goes back to cleaning.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Lev and I were talking about
dialog: getting a maid to come in once a
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: A maid?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Yeah, it’s not that expensive, like
dialog: $400 bucks a month?
text: Frances cleans drunkenly, thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Do you know that I’m actually poor?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: You aren’t poor. There are poor
dialog: people. You aren’t one of them.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yes, but it’s, I mean, you’d feel
dialog: poor if you had as little money as
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: But you’re not poor. That’s
dialog: offensive to actual poor people.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yeah, I guess that’s true.
text: Frances keeps cleaning. Benji considers something.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: You want -- you want to hear
dialog: something hilarious?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Lev thinks we’re going to end up
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I’m too tall to marry.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Ha! You are.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: That’s so funny. Why would he think
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I did want to sleep with you when I
dialog: first met you.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: But now - totally undateable!
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I guess we are like a married
dialog: couple in a way. We talk. We don’t
dialog: have sex.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Yeah. We get along super well.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Sophie and I used to be like that,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: But Sophie was a girl. And you were
dialog: both straight. So it had less,
dialog: like, real world probability.
text: Frances yawns.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Right. Of course. Well. I’m done. I
dialog: hope I don’t have the spins when I
dialog: lay down.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Just lay on your back by the edge
text: of the bed and put one foot on the
dialog: floor. It helps.
text: Frances nods. Benji reluctantly gets off the bed.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Goodnight, then.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Night. Good luck with Beverly Hills
dialog: Cop.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Four.
text: Benji walks towards the door.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Open? Shut?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Um, shut. I think. I don’t know.
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I‘1l leave it open so if you need
dialog: to throw up or cry or something you
dialog: can call me.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Thanks. Yeah. Open.
text: He’s gone. Frances sits down on the bed.

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: FRANCES

dialog: E-mail.
text: They walk along in silence.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Hey! Have you ever done--where you
dialog: sing and--the other... It’s easier
dialog: to just do it, okay? You sing, make
dialog: up some songs about whatever, and
dialog: I’1l dance...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Oh for money, kind of, so if you
text: see someone then just shout “GIVE
dialog: ME YOUR MONEY!”
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don’t want to.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I‘1l sing and you dance, if you
dialog: want.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We don’t need money like that.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: It’s not for money. I think it’s
dialog: good to feel stupid sometimes. Did
dialog: you see that movie, Once?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I've worked in homeless shelters
dialog: and it’s not funny to make fun of
dialog: people who have to beg and
text: panhandle.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Panhandle sounds old fashioned.
text: Rachel looks annoyed.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I’m not making fun. Just watch me
dialog: do it for a second.
text: Frances launches into singing and dancing while Rachel just
text: stands there. Someone walks by and Frances screams:
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (staring)
dialog: This is making me very
dialog: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (suddenly stops)
dialog: It’s stupid. Sorry.
text: They walk along again in silence.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Do you want to put on really fancy

text: Rachel says nothing.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Sorry about that. Thank you.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You’re welcome.

speaker_heading: JANELLE
dialog: She's in the 90 percentile for
dialog: height and 95 for weight.
speaker_heading: ANDY
text: But it evens out later. When they
dialog: walk. It doesn’t mean she’1l be
dialog: fat.
text: Spencer hands it to Frances. She fiddles around on the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Oh, I think you're getting a call.
text: She hands the phone to Andy who checks it and puts it in his
dialog: pocket.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: It’s so funny when people have kids
dialog: and they’re all “I used to be so
dialog: focussed on ‘me’ and now I’m
dialog: totally not” - it’s like, NO! It’s
dialog: still you. It’s a mini you! It’s
dialog: a half you! I mean, you made it!
dialog: (eating too fast)
dialog: I forgot to eat today.
dialog: Pockets of conversation:
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: The only time you ever hear the
dialog: phrase “I’m not here to make
text: friends” is on reality television.
text: Andy starts to pour Frances wine. She puts her hand over the
text: glass, some splashing on her fingers.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Oh...sorry.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I’m trying not to drink right now.
scene_heading: Revision (05/14/2012) 61.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Oh, I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Don’t be sorry. You’re not the one
dialog: who's bat-shit crazy after four
dialog: vodkas.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yeah...Nadia had a hard time giving
dialog: it up while she was pregnant.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: “What do you do?” It’s such a
dialog: stupid question I thought I’d ask
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Oh, I’m a lawyer. What do you do?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: What a stupid question! Just
dialog: kidding...it’s, it’s hard to
dialog: explain.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Because what you do is complicated?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: No...because I don’t really do it?
text: Suddenly all conversation has stopped and everyone has turned
dialog: to Frances.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Well, I’m a dancer, I guess.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Frances and I are in the same

speaker_heading: FRANCES

dialog: I have a meeting with Colleen on
dialog: Monday morning.
dialog: Revision (05/14/2012) 62.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (to the table, rambling)
dialog: But I’m doing really good. Rachel
dialog: and I have a really cool place. Or
dialog: Rachel does and I’m staying there
dialog: for six-ish weeks.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Five.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Right. Five. I’ve been running a
dialog: lot. I think I might be training
dialog: for the marathon.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Really?
dialog: People react positively: Oh! Cool!
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: But, yeah, everything is up in the
dialog: air. I like being alone. I just
dialog: got back from Sacramento.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: Andy and Janelle just got back from
dialog: Paris.
speaker_heading: JANELLE
text: Six and half hours on a plane with
dialog: a baby. Won’t be doing that again
dialog: soon! But it was heaven.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (to Frances)
dialog: Do you ever get to Paris?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Not really. No. Kind of once.
dialog: Actually, no. What’s that museum
dialog: with the escalators in tubes?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: The Pompidou.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yeah!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Um, do you get there?
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: They have a great place in the 6th.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It’s a little pied a terre.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Literally!
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: --but it’s a really special place.
speaker_heading: JANELLE
dialog: It’s just been so hard to spend any
dialog: time there since I got the job at
dialog: the Journal.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And the baby.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I'd love to go to Paris. I'’11 bet
dialog: it’s magic. One of my friends from
dialog: college, Abby, who moved there
dialog: because her boyfriend works for a
dialog: bank. In school, she was on of the
dialog: top five friends, but then Zoe
dialog: became closer to our friend group
dialog: and Abby kind of moved to the outer
dialog: ring.
text: Everyone at the table listens politely. Rachel could give
dialog: two shits.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Sophie and Abby never totally got
text: along. She started dating Luke who
dialog: I always thought would have dated
dialog: any of us, but he ended up with
dialog: Abby.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Well, let me know if you’re ever
dialog: there, we like for it to be used.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Oh okay...I don’t see myself
dialog: probably getting there super soon,
dialog: but...thanks, thanks.

speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Oh, yeah, I know Patch! ‘Sup bra?
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Mm. Yes, Patch knows more about
dialog: South American currency stability
dialog: than almost anyone else I know.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: His girlfriend Sophie and I are the
dialog: same person with different hair.
dialog: Not really. We went to college
dialog: together and took the train into
dialog: the city on weekends and made bad
dialog: decisions.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You got pregnant?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: No. What? No!
speaker_heading: NADIA
dialog: She's a great lady. I really like
dialog: her. So smart.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, we're
dialog: all smart.
speaker_heading: NADIA
dialog: But she’s like book-smart, smart.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
text: She’s actually not. She doesn’t
dialog: really read. I mean except for
dialog: work which is the funny thing.
speaker_heading: NADIA
text: She seems like she reads a lot to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I read way more.
speaker_heading: NADIA
dialog: Uh huh.
text: Frances hesitates, hating herself in this conversation.
dialog: *
dialog: 83
dialog: Revision (05/14/2012) 65.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I don’t know why I’m shit-talking
dialog: Sophie. She’s basically the best
dialog: person I know.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Crazy, though, right?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yeah. Which thing?
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Japan.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Japan?
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: They're moving to Japan in a couple
dialog: of weeks.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Patch got transferred. It’s a
dialog: really cool position. TK.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: For how long?
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Indefinite.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: But Sophie has a job at Random
dialog: House.
speaker_heading: NADIA
dialog: She quit.
text: CLOSE on Frances’ face as it changes, pained and sad and
text: everything bad all at once. Conversation turns to other
dialog: things, travel plans, airlines, food.
text: Frances reaches for the wine and pours herself a steep glass.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: People have moved from the table and are now on the 83
text: terrace. Frances smokes. She’s drunk. She talks to
dialog: Nadia.
scene_heading: Revision (05/14/2012) 66.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Nadia, I want this one
dialog: moment...it’s what I want ina
dialog: relationship, which might explain
dialog: why I’m single now ha ha. It’s hard
dialog: to...it’s like that thing where you
dialog: are with someone and you love them
dialog: and they know it, and they love you
dialog: and you know it but it’s a party
dialog: and you're both talking to other
text: people and laughing and shining and
dialog: you look across the room and catch
dialog: each other’s eye not because you
dialog: are possessive or that it’s
dialog: precisely sexual but because that
dialog: is your person in this life. And
dialog: it’s funny and sad, but only
dialog: because this life will end, and
dialog: it’s a secret world that no one
dialog: else knows about that exists right
dialog: there in public unnoticed - sort of
dialog: like how they say other dimensions
dialog: exist all around us but we don’t
dialog: have the ability to perceive them.
dialog: That’s...that’s what I want out of
dialog: a relationship. Or just life, I
dialog: guess. Love. Blah, I sound stoned.
dialog: I’m not stoned.
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Thanks for dinner. Bye!
speaker_heading: NADIA
dialog: Oh...bye.
text: Frances grabs her backpack. Rachel catches her.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Where the fuck are you going?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Oh, I’m kind of wasted. I was
dialog: going to go home. Is that okay?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don’t care, I was just kidding.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (pause, to the group)
dialog: Thanks for inviting me tonight.
speaker_heading: JANELLE
dialog: Nice to have met you.

speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Hey, Andy, actually, I think I
dialog: might be going to Paris this
dialog: weekend.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Oh...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you want to stay in our
dialog: apartment?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Okay. Wonderful. I’11 get you the

speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Frances?!
text: Frances turns around. It’s Benji. With a girl.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
speaker_heading: BENJI!
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: I knew it was you! Your weird man

speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: (to the girl)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: BENJI

dialog: Frances and I used to be married. *
speaker_heading: CAROLINE *
dialog: Cool. *
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: What are you guys doing? Want to
dialog: get a drink?
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: We're going to my friend’s party -
dialog: it’s a house party. I mean, that’s
dialog: the theme.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: How is that a theme?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Amazing, right?
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
text: And it’s in an apartment.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You can come with us. If you want.
text: Frances considers for a moment.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: No...I really. I shouldn’t. I’m
dialog: going to Paris this weekend.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Good for you, kid.
dialog: (probably lying)
dialog: I lived there for like a year.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: You never told me that.
speaker_heading: BENJI

dialog: *
dialog: Gainsbourg died. It was a crazy
dialog: time? *
dialog: Revision (05/14/2012) 69.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: In 1991? When you were eight?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Yeah, it was the end of Euro-disco.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I have so much to do. I think I’11
dialog: read Proust because sometimes you
dialog: should do what you’re supposed to
dialog: do when you’re supposed to do it.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Proust is pretty heavy.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: Yeah, but it’s worth it, I hear.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: No, I mean the book. Carrying it
text: on the plane.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I should probably learn French
dialog: first and read it in French.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Undateable!
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Mm.
text: Benji smiles warmly.
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: Well, kid. We’ve got to run.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Nice meeting you.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: You, too. You’re very pretty.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Thank you?
speaker_heading: BENJI
dialog: See you around, weirdo.
text: He ruffles her hair. He and Caroline take each other’s hands

speaker_heading: FRANCES

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I thought you couldn’t pay me rent.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I can’t. I have no cash. I’m
dialog: putting in on this credit card I
dialog: got in the mail.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That’s not smart. That’s what they
dialog: want. They want to keep you in
dialog: debt.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: I know that. I see documentaries.
dialog: Hey! Do you want to come?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I travel with the company, it’s
dialog: enough for me.
speaker_heading: FRANCES
dialog: So today is, what? Wednesday...I

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What’s that about anyway?
speaker_heading: FRANCES
