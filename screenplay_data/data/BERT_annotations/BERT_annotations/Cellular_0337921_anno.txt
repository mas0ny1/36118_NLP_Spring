text: TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND.
text: We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the
text: distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the
text: Downtown Los Angeles skyline.
text: In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal
text: the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood.
text: HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a
text: gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the
text: landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet.
text: CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face the resplendent
text: Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr ont walk, able to
text: admire the manicured hedges and the black E scalade in the
text: driveway, to the front door decorated with a whimsical
text: placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we pass THROUGH THE
text: KEYHOLE into the foyer.
scene_heading: INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an
text: athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as
text: she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes Donna, I'm out the door.
text: We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the
text: kitchen, unable to see her face.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Just inform Kayleigh that
text: anesthesia is on the way to prep
dialog: the epidural and I'll be there as
dialog: soon as I can.
text: Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently
text: straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she
dialog: talks.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And promise her she's about to have
text: a woooonnderful labor.
text: As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her
text: HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket.
text: They give each other a silent wave.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Right, I'll see you in twenty.
text: She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME
text: AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but
text: ready for the day ahead.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Buenas dias, Rosario.
speaker_heading: ROSARIO
dialog: Good morning Miss Jessica.
text: Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY.
text: In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads
text: for the back door carrying the basket of laundry.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: (on machine)
dialog: Honey? Honey, wake up. Pick up the-
text: And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips--
text: SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN
text: storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of
text: quick cuts, noise and confusion.
text: Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is
text: stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark.
text: Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --
speaker_heading: LEAD GUNMAN
dialog: Get away from there! Don't touch
dialog: that -- !!
text: -- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!! He
text: blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on
dialog: Jessica.
speaker_heading: LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (dire)
dialog: Where is he?
text: Jessica cringes.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Where is who?
speaker_heading: LEAD GUNMAN
dialog: Wrong answer.
text: The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the
text: face, knocking Jessica cold.
text: Then he turns to his men.
speaker_heading: LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Search the house.
text: And as the answering machine fills the silence:
speaker_heading: CRAIG VO
dialog: (on machine)
dialog: -I'll call back later.
text: The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness
text: of his masked face.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY
text: The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us.
text: We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through:
text: An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They
text: bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees--
text: ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its
text: destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is
dialog: dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could
dialog: scream for a week and no one would hear a thing.
text: As the van stops--
text: WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS:
scene_heading: INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE
text: A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing
text: the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the
text: room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she
text: frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--
scene_heading: THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER
text: Standing in front of her. Sturdier than the rest. Solid.
dialog: Imposing.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Wh... what do you want?
text: Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her.
text: Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze...
text: Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room.
text: Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her
text: throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT.
text: Grim as death, he stalks toward her --
speaker_heading: JESSICA (CONT'D)
dialog: No, wait..
text: And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --
speaker_heading: JESSICA (CONT'D)
dialog: NO! PLEASE--//
text: SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above
text: Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that
dialog: hung there.
text: As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns
text: and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking
text: Jessica in the darkness.
text: Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to
text: show through. Trembling, tears running down her face,
text: Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--
speaker_heading: JESSICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Wha... what the hell is happening?!
text: The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: THE OCEAN
text: Skimming along the water.
text: And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern

scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING
dialog: It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are
text: preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier.
text: VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead.
text: BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE
text: MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design.
text: HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand.
text: FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.
scene_heading: INT. SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNING
scene_heading: ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN.
text: The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer
text: generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed.
text: Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is:
text: RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the
text: beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal
dialog: reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi
dialog: Master of the game.
text: Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You recording this?
speaker_heading: CHAD (OS)
dialog: Yeah, sure...
text: CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING
text: CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces
text: on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone.
text: Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes
text: on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Move, bitch.
text: He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes "NEW RECORD."
text: Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Nice.
text: The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Get that?
text: Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down
text: the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum
dialog: Monster in Hi-Def videostream-
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on
dialog: that.
text: Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the
text: cellphone out of his pants and hits "SEND".
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: (through cup-holding
dialog: teeth)
dialog: Sweet. It's going to my email
dialog: right now.
text: S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad
text: wipes it dry on his pants.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Watch it dude, I gotta return that
dialog: thing in seven days.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: They aren't giving you shit yet?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Nah, whenever I return it, I just
dialog: list off why the phone sucks and
dialog: they give me a new model. Figure
dialog: by the tenth time I'll have to go
dialog: somewhere else.
text: Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames. Game Over.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE OCEAN
text: As seen looking over the rail of the pier. The tide is in,
text: but it's still a forty foot drop.
text: RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate
text: contemplating his last meal.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Go already. No one's looking.
text: His left hand holds his WALLET.
speaker_heading: CHAD (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: wallet)
dialog: Need me to hold that?
text: Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips
text: a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Waterproof.
text: But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left
text: leg starts trembling like crazy.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: This is stupid. I could get
dialog: killed. Pick another dare.
text: Chad lowers the phone, irritated.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: My ass. Not after you made me
dialog: march in the Gay Pride Parade
text: wearing a thong.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Screw it then. In one... Two...
dialog: Two and a half--
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot.
text: Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts
text: snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to
dialog: the deck.
speaker_heading: CHAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Just so you know, I'm emailing this
dialog: to every chick you ever met.
text: But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare. His eyes are
dialog: glued to something else--
speaker_heading: CHAD (CONT'D)
dialog: (speaking like HAL 900)
text: Transmitting pussy file now.
text: CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can
text: pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS
text: carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the
dialog: "Heal The Bay" rally.
text: Ryan walks over like he owns the place.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Got any more? I'm here to help.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Thanks, but no, we got 'em all.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What's in 'em?
text: Chloe opens the box. Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Cool, you're handing these out
dialog: during the concert?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Yeah, wanna help?
text: Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hell yeah. I'm all about "Heal the
dialog: Bay. "
text: His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup
dialog: thing, of course...
text: An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder,
text: pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so
text: Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We've collected water samples with
dialog: the Stream Team, raised money on
dialog: the Promenade... I'm surprised I
dialog: haven't seen you.
text: He offers his hand.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ryan.
text: She takes it.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Chloe.
text: The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and
text: they both smile at each other. Chad splits.
speaker_heading: CHLOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't tell if you're full of it.
text: Ryan stops posturing, gets real.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You ever go up to Santa Barbara?
dialog: My dad used to take me there all
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: the time. Their pier is amazing,
text: clear water, huge crabs everywhere,
text: oysters right there on the rocks,
dialog: starfish... Hard to believe it's
dialog: the same ocean sometimes.
dialog: He's managed to win her back.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Maybe you and I can take a break
text: later when Pat Benatar goes on.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sounds like a plan.
dialog: There's a moment... Then --
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to
text: pick up a box of T-shirts at the
text: Kinkos on Venice.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'll do it for you... if you want.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Seriously, you would?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sure. How much is the bill?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Nothing. It's been paid up front.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Do you promise not to go anywhere?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Done.
text: Ryan makes a graceful exit. Turns back.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Okay, I won't be long.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Bye.
text: Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot:
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Dude, does Santa Barbara have a
dialog: harbor or a pier?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE - DAY
text: A short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice
dialog: neighborhood.
text: Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn
text: across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" T-SHIRTS now
text: sits on the shotgun seat.
text: Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush.
text: He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing.
text: Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa,
text: and grabs the cellphone.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Dex, wassup? You won't believe the
dialog: hotties I just met at the pier.
dialog: Smoking. You wanna meet them?
dialog: Yeah? Well don't get too excited

text: Ryan stops at a red light.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Bullshit, you're not going

dialog: I'm pulling up right now.
text: Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING. It's deafening.

text: away angrily.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (covering his ear)
dialog: What? Yeah, you better be. And I
dialog: need your shower, I'm talkin' code
dialog: red stankage-
text: The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan
text: drives under an OVERPASS.
dialog: Suddenly --
text: The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan
text: notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car
text: skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before
text: hitting the other car's bumper.
text: He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED
scene_heading: WITH STATIC.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Dex? You still there...?
dialog: And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY OVERPASS - MOMENTS LATER 10
text: As traffic resumes and Ryan clears the overpass--
speaker_heading: ID iu
scene_heading: SFX: THE CELLPHONE RINGS.
text: Ryan picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sorry, got cut off. Hey -- what's
dialog: my Caller ID say?

speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)

text: the attic floor, past the rubble of the shattered phone,
text: foll9wing the crudely repaired wires to JESSICA'S HANDS,
text: tapping the dialer wires together. She's trying so hard to
text: simulate a NUMERIC PULSE that she almost doesn't hear:
speaker_heading: RYAN (VO)
dialog: Hello...?
text: Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then -- WHOOM! -- her head
text: slams down INTO FRAME on top of the crushed earpiece, a

speaker_heading: JESSICA (VO)

speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: RYAN
text: Awfully polite kidnappers to give

text: Jessica's voice TREMBLES uncontrollably. Desperate, fearful
text: and frustrated.
speaker_heading: JESSICA (VO)
dialog: No! You don't understand!
text: Suddenly, the cellphone BLIPS twice in Ryan's ear. He pulls
text: it away and looks at its faceplate.
scene_heading: 14 INSERT SHOT - THE CELLPHONE 14
text: The LCD reads: CALL WAITING. ACCEPT?
scene_heading: 15 EXT. SURFACE STREETS - DAY 15
speaker_heading: RYAN

scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: 16 INT. ATTIC 16
text: A WIDER SHOT so we see Jessica's bound hands. Her bruised

speaker_heading: JESSICA (VO)
dialog: Goddamn it, listen to me! The

speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: JESSICA (CONT'D)
dialog: These men killed my housekeeper.
dialog: My dog. You have to help me.

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: (gesturing to the radio)
dialog: Do you want me to change the
dialog: station to something else?
text: Ricky refuses to answer. Ellis turns around, his fake smile
text: quickly vanishing.
speaker_heading: ELLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah. I like Creedence too.
text: He's about to turn the radio volume up when --
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Where's Rosario?
speaker_heading: ELLIS
dialog: I told you, kid, she had a doctor's
dialog: appointment, so your mother asked
dialog: us to pick you up. Don't worry,
dialog: you'll see your mommy in a few
dialog: minutes.
text: Ricky nods... but we can tell by the look on his face that
dialog: he's not buying their story one bit.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: 41 EXT. RENT-A-COP CAR 41
text: Cautiously, so as not to give himself away, Ryan PASSES one
text: commuter car. Then the next. Narrowing the gap between the
text: rent-a-cop car and the Escalade to one last auto.
text: It takes Ryan literally standing on the gas pedal to get up
text: enough speed to get around the final car. Now the Escalade
text: is dead ahead. Ryan begins gently closing the distance
text: between them, and is just starting to relax, when--
speaker_heading: A CITY BUS
text: merges into traffic from a Bus Stop right ahead of him!
dialog: 32.
dialog: 41 41
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: SHIT!
text: Ryan SLAMS on his breaks and is forced to crawl along at a
text: ainful 25 m.p.h.. Worse, he has his view of the Escalade
text: glocked by the bus' titanic silver ass.
speaker_heading: JESSICA (VO)
dialog: Johnny!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Damn! There's this stupid bus--
text: Ryan jags left and right, catching glimpses around the bus of
text: the Escalade still ahead.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (taps his horn)
dialog: Come on!
text: But the bus doesn't pull over. Ryan tries flashing the
text: security car's CLEAR BUBBLE LIGHTS on the roof, but who the
dialog: hell would pull over for that? The bus sure doesn't.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus.'
speaker_heading: JESSICA (VO)
dialog: Can't you go around it?
text: There's an ungodly amount of opposing traffic--
text: But suddenly there's a break in the flow! Seizing the
text: moment, Ryan SLAM-SH IFTS the rent-a -cop car's uni-cylinder
text: engine into gear and starts to tear around the bus -- but has
text: to SWERVE BACK as a SPEEDING TRASH TRUCK rounds a bend and
dialog: almost creams him!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Goddamn it!
speaker_heading: JESSICA (VO)
dialog: What?! Did you lose him? !
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No, I just almost got killed, is
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Oh thank God!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Thank God?
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: That's nice.
text: Just then, the bus signals that it's pulling over.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, here we go!
dialog: 33.
dialog: 41 41
text: As the bus pulls aside, Ryan floors the wanna-be cop car
text: around it...but directly in front of him is a HOMELESS MAN,
text: dressed like a sheik, dragging his caravan of TWO COVERED
scene_heading: SHOPPING CARTS.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: SON- OF- A-- II
text: Ryan SLAMS on the brakes, SWERVES HARD to avoid a collision --
text: and loses cont rol of the car! The rent-a-cop car goes POWER
text: SLIDING across oncoming traffic, HORNS BLARING AT HIM and
text: heads straight for a the FLOOR TO CEILING WINDOW of a CAR
speaker_heading: DEALERSHIP.
scene_heading: 42 INT. CAR DEALERSHIP 42
text: SMASH!!! The car goes through the window and RACES down the
text: center aisle. CAR SALESMEN and PATRONS are forced to dive
text: out of the way as the rent-a-cop car MOWS DOWN DISPLAYS and
dialog: everything else in its path.

dialog: Anyone following us?
dialog: Deason checks:
scene_heading: THE REARVIEW MIRROR

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:

speaker_heading: RYAN
speaker_heading: SHIT I

dialog: What?! Yo u lost--
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No, No! just give me a second--
text: As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses
text: on finding the Escalade. He floors the rent-a-cop car, engine
text: CLATTERING, to the intersection.
text: Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade
text: is nowhere to be seen. He floors it.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus! Where the hell did they go?
text: Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the
dialog: receiver.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Jessica, I--
speaker_heading: JESSICA (VO)
dialog: You let them get away.

text: The cops start to snicker; they've all heard that one before.
speaker_heading: COP ONE (CONT'D)
dialog: So I start searching the place.
text: I'm about to open a closet door
text: when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out
text: of the bathroom. He shoots.
dialog: Misses me and hits one of the
text: E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun
text: jams and BAM! Blows half his face
dialog: off. Had enough black tar heroin
text: in the closet to resurface the 405.

speaker_heading: MOONEY

speaker_heading: DEEP MALE VOICE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MOONEY
dialog: Hey Tomlin.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE TOMLIN
dialog: Taking off?
speaker_heading: MOONEY
dialog: (hardly thrilled)
dialog: My anniversary. You know, duty
dialog: calls; pricey dinner and then some

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hey, I sent some college kid down
dialog: to see you this morning. Had some
dialog: rap about a kidnapping --
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE TOMLIN
dialog: I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask
dialog: around. Kidnapping, huh?
speaker_heading: MOONEY
dialog: I thought it was a prank at first,
dialog: but the kid was so worked up--
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE TOMLIN
dialog: Well, don't you get worked up.
dialog: (slaps Mooney's chest)
dialog: If the kid comes back, page me, and

scene_heading: SUDDENLY -- SFX: RYAN'S PHONE BEGINS BEEPING.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What now?

scene_heading: INSERT SHOT - CELLPHONE FACE PLATE

speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Great! Now the battery's dying.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Don't you have a charger?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It's in my car! Hold on.
text: SFX: BEEP-BEEP! The battery indicator has lost another bar.
text: Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens

speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus -- !
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: What's going on? Did you find one?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (staring at the gun)

speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Johnny, don't lose me!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Well what the hell do you expect me
dialog: to do?!
text: Just then, Ryan rounds a corner -- and sees traffic GRIDLOCKED

scene_heading: SFX: BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Johnny--!
dialog: 37.
dialog: 46 46
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I know, Jessica!
text: The phone starts a STEADY BEEPING now, dying imminent. And
text: traffic isn't going anywhere. Ryan looks around desperately.
text: Nothing. No emergency lane. No shoulder. Just a long drop
text: down a HILL to a strip mall below--
text: STRIP MALL?! Ryan scans it and does a double-take on one of
text: the store's signs: "VERIZON WIRELESS".
text: Traffic inches forward. Now he sees an OFF-RAMP a quarter-
dialog: mile ahead -- but at this rate, it'll take forever to make it
dialog: there.
scene_heading: SFX: BEEP-BEEP-BEEP...'.'
dialog: Ryan's got to do something. Now.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know that money you promised me?
speaker_heading: JESSICA (VO)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'm giving myself a raise.
scene_heading: 47 EXT. VERIZON MALL HILL - CONTINUOUS 47
text: And with that, Ryan CRANKS the steering wheel hard right and
text: HITS THE GAS! Despite other drivers' protests, the little
text: Rent-a-Cop vehicle blasts across the gridlock, TEARS through
text: the rusty GUARD RAIL and -- VROOOOM! -- flies off the side of
dialog: the hill!
text: Ryan lets out a frightened yell as he SAILS through the clear
text: blue sky.
speaker_heading: RYAN
scene_heading: HOOOOLLYYY SHIIII--
text: THUMP! The Rent-a-Cop car touches down on a steep downslope.
text: Ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile,
text: miraculously avoiding the minefield of ROCKS and TREE STUMPS.
text: He needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its
text: antenna in his teeth.
dialog: There's so much noise, the only thing Jessica could possibly
text: hear is a CACOPHONY OF NOISE and Ryan HYPERVENTILATING.
speaker_heading: JESSICA (VO)
dialog: What's going on?!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (with phone in teeth)
dialog: mmmrrmph mrm mrmph!
text: Ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until
text: the car hits a jutting rock and -- WHOOOOM! -- goes up on two
text: wheels. It looks like it's going to roll but gravity brings
dialog: 38.
dialog: 47 47
text: it back down -- SLAMM! -- so hard that the phone goes flying
dialog: across the car!
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit!
text: Ryan scrabbles for the phone -- but gives it up when he
text: bounces over a rise and sees A BILLBOARD DEAD AHEAD!
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: WHOAAAAAA!
text: Ryan whips the wheel and navigates the little car between the
text: billboard's concrete posts, but -- WHAM! -- obliterates the
text: rent-a-cop's BUBBLE LIGHTS on the billboard's lower edge.
text: Somehow, Ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the
text: rest of the hill and into the strip mall parking lot, where
text: it SKIDS OUT.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (grabbing phone)
dialog: Jessica?! Can you hear me?!
speaker_heading: JESSICA (VO)
dialog: I'm here!
text: Ryan hops out and races inside--
scene_heading: 48 THE VERIZON WIRELESS STORE - CONTINUOUS 48
text: And of course, they're having a sale and the place is packed.
text: Every SALESPERSON is beyond busy in the feeding frenzy.
scene_heading: SFX: BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!
text: Panicking, Ryan pushes his way to the front of the counter --
speaker_heading: IRATE CUSTOMERS
dialog: Hey, what do you think you're
dialog: doing? There's a line!
text: -- to the OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN helping someone else.
scene_heading: OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN

scene_heading: OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN

speaker_heading: OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (indicates a number

dialog: But if you take a number, someone
dialog: will be with you shortly.
text: Ryan glances at the dispenser. A BIG YELLOW SMILEY FACE with
text: tickets ejected from the mouth. The next ticket it offers is
text: "#97"...and the Now-Serving Display on the wall reads "#71".
scene_heading: SFX: BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!I
text: Just then, a BUSY SALESWOMAN walks by. Ryan grabs her.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hey! Hey! I've got an emergency

speaker_heading: BUSY SALESWOMAN
dialog: Sorry, I'm on break--
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Damn it, will you listen to me?!

scene_heading: SFX: BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!

speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Help, I --
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: Take a number.
text: The room starts spinning around him. It's clear no one's
text: going to help him. Like the clap of doom, the NOW-SERVING
text: DISPLAY on the wall flips happily to "#72"
scene_heading: SFX: BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!
text: Frantic, Ryan glances at the phone. And just as the last

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Aw, screw this...

text: "BRENTWOOD" when Ryan handed him the phone.
text: Mooney crumples the paper and is about to throw it away...but
text: stops himself. He stares at the words, then unable to let it

scene_heading: JESSICA KATE MARTIN. 327 ELMWOOD ESTATES, BRENTWOOD.

speaker_heading: GREEK

scene_heading: 54 BACK TO ATTIC 54

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: JESSICA (CONT'D)
dialog: ...but I am going to, aren't I?
speaker_heading: GREER

speaker_heading: 54 54

speaker_heading: JESSICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Please! Believe me. That has to
dialog: be where he means. I swear to God.
text: Then he stands, looking away for just a moment -- but long
text: enough for Jessica to NUDGE the phone back behind the beam!
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Working in my profession as long as
dialog: I have, you begin to recognize the

speaker_heading: GREER (CONT'D)
dialog: (turning back)

text: THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM. PEOPLE start filling the stairwell

text: Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan bolts up the stairs
text: until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He shoves
text: open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof.
text: He slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as--
scene_heading: 123 INT. STAIRWELL - DAY 123
text: GREER and HODGES reach the floor beneath. See the door

dialog: toward the-
scene_heading: 124 EXT. ROOF - DAY 124
text: Ryan's eyes SCAN the rooftop. Construction is in progress up
text: here; tarpapering. Huge ROLLS OF TARPAPER lie about,

scene_heading: AIR CONDITIONER...
text: Ryan quickly shoves a 2"x4" under the doorknob to jam it.
text: Heart pounding, he races to the building's edge and looks
text: down. Nothing but a straight drop 60 feet down.
text: Footsteps are approaching! POUNDING on the door! Ryan darts
text: behind a tarp-covered mass of supplies just as --
scene_heading: 125 EXT. ROOF - DAY 125

text: Greer encircles the huge air-conditioner while Hodges hunts
text: behind a large SATELLITE DISH. No Ryan.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: (to Hodges)
dialog: Here.
text: Cop-instincts crackling, Greer stands on one side of the tarp-

text: This is it; they signal go at each other and spring around --
dialog: But Ryan's nowhere to be found!
speaker_heading: GREER (CONT'D)
dialog: Dammit!
text: No, wait! Greer turns and sees a LARGE ALUMINUM CHUTE that

speaker_heading: 125 125
text: Greer peers down the chute for long seconds...but nothing can
text: be seen from this angle. It all falls to blackness.
text: THE ALARM STOPS.
text: Greer cocks his head in the sudden eerie silence. The only
text: sounds are INCOHERENT SCREAMS coming from the stairwell. He

speaker_heading: REVEAL --
scene_heading: 126 INT. METAL CHUTE - CONTINUOUS 126
text: RYAN, wedging himself against the sides of the chute, tries

text: ALUMINUM BUCKLE AND GROAN.
text: From his shirt pocket, Jessica's tiny desperate voice pleads.
speaker_heading: JESSICA (VO)
dialog: Ryan... ? Ryan, please answer me I

scene_heading: 127 EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS 127

scene_heading: .28 INT. METAL CHUTE - CONTINUOUS 128

text: Straining to hear Greer, it's impossible not to hear:
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: You have to talk to me! Ryan,
dialog: please you have to talk to me--.'
text: The sweat from his hands causes the tiniest SLIP -- and as he

dialog: stressed metal.
text: Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls
text: the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear.
text: Desperate to console her, Ryan --
text: BANG!! The TARPAPER ROLL flies down the chute. Ryan looks
text: up to see it angrily launching itself right at him!
text: He has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit. He presses
dialog: himself to one side but --
text: WHAM!! The bloodthirsty roll bashes his wrist -- and he DROPS
scene_heading: SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE!

speaker_heading: DEASON
dialog: WHAT THE--?!

speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Don't hurt me, and I'll do

text: There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason
text: responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her
text: flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty
text: fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him.
text: Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins
text: to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted
text: as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she
text: flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper
dialog: arm.
text: Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs
text: as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand--
speaker_heading: DEASON
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Oooh.
text: --but that's when he HEARS it. A DRIPPING SOUND. Deason
text: looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt
text: sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto
text: the floor like a river.
text: Deason drains white; dizzy. He looks at Jessica, confused.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
text: Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30
dialog: liters of blood per minute...and

text: He ducks back down as bullets ricochet off the steel

scene_heading: 138 INT. MARTIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 138

speaker_heading: MOONEY
dialog: Damn it! DAMN IT!!
text: Angry, the adrenaline drowning out the pain, Mooney turns to

scene_heading: 194 INT. THE DORY ENTRANCE - NIGHT 194
text: TOMLIN - By the time his eyes adjust to the dark, Ryan is
text: nowhere to be seen. TARPS undulate over jumbles of boxes and
text: equipment everywhere -- a hundred places to hide.
text: Alone, Tomlin stalks among the equipment. Gun out. Hunting
text: Ryan like a snake on the scent or prey.
speaker_heading: TOMLIN
dialog: You're wounded kid, just give me
dialog: what I came for, and I'll let you
dialog: all go.
text: Police sirens in the distance grow louder.
text: Tomlin's offer goes unanswered. That's when he notices the
text: BLOOD on the ground. Tomlin smiles, following Ryan's trail
text: to a PILE OF BLOOD-SMEARED TARPS -- where the trail ends!
dialog: It's obvious Ryan used these to staunch his wound. Shit!
dialog: He's gonna have to search this whole place--
text: Then, suddenly, Tomlin gets an idea. He pulls out his phone,
text: making sure it's concealed from view, and writes a TEXT
dialog: MESSAGE to--
scene_heading: x95 EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT 195
text: Greer pulls out his ringing cell phone. On the text screen
text: it says, "CALL HIM". Greer flashes an wicked grin, and dials

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 196 INT. DORY - CONTINUOUS 196
text: Tomlin's ready to pounce.
text: SFX: Nearby, Ryan's cellphone starts to RING, betraying him!
text: Instantly, Tomlin hones in on the noise -- coming from under
text: a bulky tarp along the far wall -- and EMPTIES HIS GUN at it!
text: The tarp shreds. Nothing could survive the assault.
text: Tomlin walks calmly across the room to stand before the tarp.
speaker_heading: TOMLIN
dialog: Shoulda stayed at home this
dialog: morning, kid.
text: And just then, Tomlin throws off the shredded tarp exposing--
text: Ryan's cellphone. And nothing else.

dialog: turns and--
speaker_heading: WHAM!
text: RYAN HITS TOMLIN in the face with a 2x4, SMASHING his TEETH
text: and sending him backwards. Before Tomlin has time to
text: rec9ver, Ryan swings again. CRACK! -- And his KNEE CAP is
text: obliterated. Ryan, looking like a psychotic Babe Ruth, gives
text: Tomlin two more vicious WHACKS before grabbing his cellphone
text: and high-tailing it out of there.

text: Just as Hodges reaches for the door handle -- Jessica wraps
text: her cuffs around his throat, throws her legs against the back

text: He PUSHES Ryan behind a SUV so as not to be seen by the cops.
speaker_heading: GREEK
dialog: No more bullshit! Just give me the
dialog: goddamn disc!
text: Ryan slowly unzips his front jacket pocket and removes the
dialog: DVD.
text: Greer snatches it and SMASHES it to pieces. Fragments fall
text: through the cracks in the pier, to the ocean below.
text: Ryan, pale as ghost, knows he's seconds from meeting his
dialog: maker.
speaker_heading: GREER (CONT'D)
dialog: This is about to be the most
dialog: enjoyable part of an extremely
dialog: shitty day.
text: And just as he's about to pull the trigger --
text: BLAM!! Jessica fires a WARNING SHOT. Greer( startled, spins
text: around to see Jessica pointing Hodges' gun in his face.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
text: For the first time, Greer actually looks frightened.
text: Recognizing the homicidal look in her eyes, he SPUTTERS, but

speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ain't that a bitch?
