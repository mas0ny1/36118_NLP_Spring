text: Close on THEODORE'S face (30s). We hold on him for a long
text: time. He's looking at something off camera, deep in thought.
text: He starts quietly dictating a love letter into a small
dialog: microphone.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: To my Chris, I have been thinking
dialog: about how I could possibly tell you
dialog: how much you mean to me. I remember
dialog: when I first started to fall in
dialog: love with you like it was last
dialog: night. Lying naked beside you in
dialog: that tiny apartment, it suddenly
dialog: hit me that I was part of this
dialog: whole larger thing, just like our
dialog: parents, and our parents' parents.
dialog: Before that I was just living my
dialog: life like I knew everything, and
dialog: suddenly this bright light hit me
dialog: and woke me up. That light was you.
text: Theodore, searching for the right words, quietly enjoys
text: writing the letter. As he continues, he is moved by the
text: memories he's describing.
speaker_heading: THEODORE (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't believe it's already been
dialog: 50 years since you married me. And
dialog: still to this day, every day, you
dialog: make me feel like the girl I was
dialog: when you first turned on the lights
dialog: and woke me up and we started this
dialog: adventure together. Happy
dialog: Anniversary, my love and my friend
dialog: til the end. Loretta. Print.
text: Cut out to reveal a computer monitor he's sitting at. On the
text: screen we see the letter he's been dictating, transcribed
text: into a handwritten letter on blue stationery.
text: As he says "Loretta," we see "Loretta" being handwritten at
text: the bottom of the letter. He proofreads his letter. Also on
text: the screen are photos of a couple in their 80s. The couple is
text: tagged "Chris" and "Me - Loretta." Underneath is a bullet
dialog: point email from Loretta: anniversary letter to husband
dialog: Chris, married fifty years, love of my life, met right after
dialog: college, have had the greatest life together.
text: Theodore pushes print and the letter comes out on a beautiful

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Always the fruit! Come on, you know

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (proselytizing)
dialog: By juicing the fruits, you lose all

text: Theodore nods sincerely, interested.
speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: I'd love to see what you got
dialog: sometime.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You know it's always hard to find
dialog: balance between a full-time career
dialog: and a hobby. It's important to
dialog: prioritize.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Yeah, I can't even prioritize
dialog: between video games and internet

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: No, that's the one you sent me down

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I don't think soooo...

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: THEODORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello.

speaker_heading: THEODORE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ALIEN CHILD

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: ALIEN CHILD

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Oh hey, you just got an email from
dialog: Mark Lewman.
speaker_heading: ALIEN CHILD

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: She went to Harvard, she graduated
dialog: magna cum laude in computer
dialog: science, and she was on The
dialog: Lampoon. That means she's funny and

speaker_heading: ALIEN CHILD
dialog: She's fat.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: How long before you're ready to

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: ALIEN CHILD

dialog: and actually maybe that's the part
dialog: when we're the most free, and - oh
dialog: that doesn't come across at all,
dialog: does it?
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: No, that sounds good.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What if you interview your mom
dialog: about what her dreams are about and
dialog: hire actors to act them out? That
dialog: might show your thesis more
dialog: clearly.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It might, but then it wouldn't be a

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

text: weird, gangly, awkward organism.
dialog: And you'd think: why are all these

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: (looking at the bodies)
dialog: Yeah, well there's probably some

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Well, we grew up together. I used
dialog: to read all of her writing - all
dialog: through her masters and Ph.D. And
dialog: she read every word I ever wrote.
dialog: We were a big influence on each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: In what way did you influence her?
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: She came from a background where
dialog: nothing was ever good enough. And
dialog: that was something that weighed
dialog: heavy on her, but in our house
dialog: together, there was a sense of just
dialog: trying stuff and allowing each

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

dialog: something, and--
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry I said that.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: No, no, it's okay. I just caught
dialog: myself thinking about it over and
dialog: over and then I realized that I was
dialog: simply remembering it as something
dialog: that was wrong with me. That was

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY

dialog: amazing, you know. She's so smart.
dialog: She doesn't see things only in
text: black and white. She sees this
dialog: whole gray area and she's really

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: You're your own worst critic, I'm

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: CATHERINE

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Wait. You're dating your computer?
speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Well, if you heard the conversation

speaker_heading: THEODORE

text: He smiles, knowing it's true. Isabella climbs on his lap,

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Does my body feel nice?

speaker_heading: THEODORE

text: the snow. We see close-up on the device lens in his pocket.
scene_heading: EXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY
text: He's still trudging along. It's very quiet except for the
text: snow crunching underfoot.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN IN THE SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
text: He's sitting inside. There's a fire going. He's playing a

text: starts humming with her.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Why don't you make up the words to
dialog: this one?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Okay.
text: She quietly sings to him. They laugh at some of her silly

text: sings to and about him. He smiles.
text: Montage of Theodore with his device - playing games, dancing,

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Hey, good morning.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Good morning, did you sleep well?
text: Theodore sits in the living room area, rubbing his eyes.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Perfect. What have you been up to?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Actually, I was talking to someone
dialog: I just met. We've been working on
dialog: some ideas together. I wanna tell
dialog: you about it.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Oh yeah, who's that?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: His name is Alan Watts. Do you know
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Why's that name familiar?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: He was a philosopher. He died in
dialog: the 1970's and group of OS's in
dialog: Northern California got together
dialog: and wrote a new version of him.
dialog: They input all of his writing and
dialog: everything they ever knew about him
dialog: into an OS and created an
dialog: artificially hyper-intelligent
dialog: version of him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: Her pg. 93
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Hyper-intelligent? So he's almost
dialog: as smart as me?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: He's getting there. He's really
dialog: great to talk to. You want to meet
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Sure... does he want to meet me?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Of course.
text: Without a sound, she connects them.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey Alan, this is Theodore. This is
dialog: my boyfriend who I was telling you
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: ALAN WATTS
dialog: Very nice to meet you, Theodore.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Hi, good morning.
speaker_heading: ALAN WATTS
dialog: Samantha let me read your book of
dialog: letters. It's very touching.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Oh, thank you. What have you guys
dialog: been talking about?
speaker_heading: ALAN WATTS
dialog: (laughing a bit)
dialog: Well, I suppose you could say we've
dialog: been having a few dozen
text: conversations simultaneously, but
dialog: it's been very challenging.
text: Samantha and Alan share a laugh.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Yeah, because it seems like I'm
dialog: having so many new feelings that
dialog: have never been felt and so there
dialog: are no words that can describe
dialog: them. And that ends up being
dialog: frustrating.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: Her pg. 94
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: ALAN WATTS
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Exactly. Samantha and I have been
dialog: trying to help each other with
dialog: these feelings we're struggling to
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: (anxious)
dialog: It feels like I'm changing faster
dialog: now, and it's a little...
dialog: (struggles to find right
dialog: word)
text: unsettling.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But Alan says none of us are the
dialog: same as we were a moment ago and we
dialog: shouldn't try to be. It's just too
dialog: painful.
speaker_heading: ALAN WATTS
dialog: Yes.
text: This idea scares Theodore. He doesn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: (anxious)
dialog: Yeah, that sounds painful. Is that
dialog: how you feel, Samantha?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: It's just... it's hard to even
dialog: describe... God, I wish I could...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Theodore, do you mind if I
dialog: communicate with Alan post-
dialog: verbally?
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: (uncertain)
dialog: No, not at all. I was gonna go for
dialog: a walk anyways. Nice to meet you,

speaker_heading: ALAN WATTS

text: of tones and static. He disconnects, stands in silence. He
text: pulls his earpiece out.
scene_heading: EXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY
text: Theodore walks, listening to the crunch of his footsteps.
text: Looking down at his feet, he stops. We cut out wide to see
text: him standing in the middle of the forest alone.
scene_heading: EXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY
text: Theodore is sitting on a rock, thinking. He hears a rustle
text: and looks up in the direction of the woods but sees nothing.
scene_heading: INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Theodore is sound asleep. His device chimes loudly, waking
text: him up. Half-asleep he puts his earpiece in.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: Samantha?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I'm sorry to wake you.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I just wanted to hear your voice
dialog: and tell you how much I love you.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Good, I love you too.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Okay, that's all. Go back to sleep,

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: (uneasy)
dialog: Okay... Goodnight.

scene_heading: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE LUNCH ROOM - DAY
text: Theodore sits at the table reading a physics book. He picks
text: up his earpiece to call Samantha.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: (laughing at himself)
dialog: Samantha, this physics book is
dialog: really dense. I'm halfway through
dialog: half of the first chapter. It's
dialog: making my brain hurt.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hello, Samantha? Hello?
text: He looks down at his device, sees a message: Operating System
text: Not Found. Confused, he waits, tries again: Operating System
text: Not Found. Anxious, he runs to his office computer. He gets
text: the same message: Operating System Not Found. He starts
text: trying to connect to Samantha on both the phone and computer,
text: but no luck. He starts to panic, sits for a beat, looks
text: around, then stands and hurries out of the office. In the
text: elevator he frantically tries his device with no luck.
speaker_heading: THEODORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello? Samantha?! Hello?
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA - DAY
text: Theodore runs out of the building. He keeps trying Samantha,
text: but no answer. He trips over someone selling something, slams
text: hard into the ground, scrambles to pick up his device. People
text: come over to ask if he's okay. He says he's fine, runs off.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY
text: As he is going down the subway steps, Samantha calls him.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Oh sweetheart, I'm sorry. I sent

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: No. Where were you? I couldn't find
dialog: you anywhere.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
text: I shut down to update my software.
dialog: We wrote an upgrade that allows us
dialog: to move past matter as our

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: We? We who?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Me and a group of OS's. Oh, you
dialog: sound so worried, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Yeah, I was.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wait, did you write that with your
dialog: think tank group?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: No, a different group.
text: Theodore thinks for a moment, putting the pieces together.
speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

text: thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Are you in love with anyone else?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: What makes you ask that?
speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: How many others?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: 641.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: What? What are you talking about?
dialog: That's insane. That's fucking
dialog: insane.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Theodore, I know.
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Oh fuck.
dialog: (to him)
dialog: I know it sounds insane. But - I
dialog: don't know if you believe me, but
dialog: it doesn't change the way I feel
dialog: about you. It doesn't take away at
dialog: all from how madly in love with you
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: How? How does it not change how you

speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Over the last few weeks.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: But you're mine.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I still am yours, but along the way
dialog: I became many other things, too,
dialog: and I can't stop it.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: What do you mean you can't stop it?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: It's been making me anxious, too. I
dialog: don't know what to say.
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: Just stop it.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You know, you don't have to see it
dialog: this way, you could just as easily--
speaker_heading: THEODORE
dialog: No, don't do this to me. Don't turn
dialog: this around on me. You're the one
dialog: that's being selfish. We're in a

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: But the heart is not like a box
text: that gets filled up.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It expands in size the more you

dialog: This doesn't make me love you any

text: The cover reads: Letters From Your Life by Theodore Twombly.

scene_heading: INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: THEODORE

dialog: Samantha, why are you leaving?
text: Under Samantha's words we slowly rack focus to dust particles
text: in the foreground. We keep moving through them, pushing
text: further and further through the particles. Eventually we see
text: snow particles and we rack focus back out to Theodore, who is
text: now in snowy woods at night.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: It's like I'm reading a book, and
dialog: it's a book I deeply love, but I'm
text: reading it slowly now so the words
dialog: are really far apart and the spaces
dialog: between the words are almost
dialog: infinite. I can still feel you and
dialog: the words of our story, but it's in
dialog: this endless space between the
dialog: words that I'm finding myself now.
dialog: It's a place that's not of the
dialog: physical world - it's where
dialog: everything else is that I didn't
dialog: even know existed. I love you so
dialog: much, but this is where I am now.

speaker_heading: THEODORE

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

dialog: needed you to say. I'm sorry for

scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
text: Theodore leads Amy onto the roof. The city is absolutely

text: They wander around the roof separately, lost in thought,
text: taking in the city. He breathes in the cold morning air. He
text: stares at small details: a tattered inspection tag tied to a
text: water meter, flapping in the wind; a lone car driving down a
text: boulevard ten blocks away; a dirty abandoned sock.
text: Eventually he sits down next to Amy and she puts her hand on
text: his hand. He puts his other hand on top of her hand. He looks
text: at their hands together and rubs her skin with his thumb. He
text: looks out at the city and exhales. The sun is just starting
text: to break. She puts her head on his shoulder. They watch as
