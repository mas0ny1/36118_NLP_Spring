text: Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white
text: wasteland. No buildings, no animals... nothing.
dialog: 
text: CLOSER: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged
text: peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist'
text: of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting
dialog: ice.
dialog: 
text: STILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt
text: crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat
text: stretch of ice. HOLD on this scene of timeless, savage
dialog: beauty, then...
dialog: 
dialog: THUD!!!
dialog: 
text: A FACE, hooded and goggled in ECW (extreme cold weather
text: gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface
text: with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops
dialog: out --
dialog: 
text: -- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death.
dialog: It's a man.
dialog: 
text: Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have
text: snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted
text: -- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and
text: spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with
text: startling speed, it turns dark and freezes.
dialog: 
text: We PULL BACK further and look down on the body, a bizarre
text: shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE
text: PULL BACK... further and further...until all is dazzling
dialog: white.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: ...My God.

dialog:

text: head by an inch, but the shaft nails her arm holding the
text: baton that goes clattering across the floor.
dialog: 
text: The killer, wearing ECW gear with hood and goggles, takes

dialog: close.
dialog: 
text: Halfway down the hall, she hangs a hard right toward the
text: Ready Room. Throws a glance over her shoulder -- he's

text: SMACK! The killer HITS THE DOOR from the other side.

dialog: same time. It's a race.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: She swivels a nervous whirl to see -- the Killer
text: materializing out of the whiteout right behind her. He's
text: clipped into Carrie's line. He raises the axe.
dialog: 
text: He swings. She jumps back, losing her footing. Hits the
text: ice hard -- face first. The killer towers over her,
text: raising the axe again. Carrie drives her heel into his
text: knee, knocking him off balance. He drops next to her.
dialog: 
text: He reaches for Carrie, grabbing her mask, pulling it off.
text: She cries out as the FREEZING WIND catches her face.
dialog: 
text: The killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib-cracking
text: kick, flipping Carrie onto her back.
dialog: 
text: SOUND FADES from Carrie's world.
dialog:

text: draws back the axe, shiny with frozen blood. He swings.

text: Carrie's glove with it.
dialog: 
text: He swings again, but Carrie pulls hard on the rope,
text: throwing him off balance.
dialog: 
text: The axe cuts through the line. The killer hits the
text: ground, and is immediately ushered away in the wind, as
text: Carrie, clinging to the rope, slides over the ice like a
text: pendulum.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FIRST WORK TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Rubin?
dialog: 
text: She steps into the tent. Moves to the cot. There's a

text: move. She pulls at it...
dialog: 
text: ...and discovers A PAIR OF ECW PANTS -- the LEFT LEG is

speaker_heading: PRYCE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog:

dialog: like it's supposed to be.
dialog: 
text: She turns around. Tries to get the bigger picture.
text: Looks at the ground all around her. Realizes a large
text: area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few
dialog: inches thick --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARRIE (cont'd)
dialog: They were digging, Pryce. And

dialog: 
text: She heads back across the area. Scans the horizon.
text: Takes another step forward.
dialog: 
text: WHOOSH! In an instant, Carrie's gone! DISAPPEARS below
text: the ice. Only a four foot wide hole remains, that was
text: covered up with a white, iced-over tarp.
dialog: 
text: Pryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating
text: slightly, unsure of their own footing.
dialog: 
text: Pryce gets to the hole. Looks down. Carrie is
text: precariously dangling in an ICE SHAFT that slopes at a
text: slight angle. She's managed to grasp a protruding piece
text: of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to
text: hold on. It slips off. Below her -- nothing but
dialog: darkness.

speaker_heading: CARRIE (cont'd)

text: on an ESCAPE HATCH of some kind, maybe three feet high.

scene_heading: INT. ICE SHAFT - RIGHT AFTER

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Off their lights -- every surface scintillates with ice

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Cargo plane, but I don't recognize
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELFY
dialog: It's an Antanov-74. Russian made -
dialog: - late fifties. No one's put
dialog: these in the air for forty years.
dialog: 
text: Carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness,
text: heading for the cockpit.
dialog: 
text: Something BRUSHES her leg. She spins. Shines her light -
text: - which illuminates a HAND, fingers in a clawed position -
text: - as if in excruciating pain. She whips her light past
text: the hand, up the arm -- captures the FACE of a man
text: staring at her! It takes a moment to realize -- he's
text: dead, pinned between two large metal crates.
dialog: 
text: Delfy stands still. Staring. Carrie throws a look back
text: over her shoulder --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Guess that makes three.

scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT - RIGHT AFTER

speaker_heading: DELFY

speaker_heading: CARRIE
speaker_heading: (SUSPICIOUS)
dialog: Find what you're looking for?

dialog: 
text: Pryce takes a beat -- turns to she and Delfy.

speaker_heading: PRYCE

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRYCE
dialog: They put some serious work into
dialog: this.

dialog: in blood --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Whoever got hurt, they dragged him
dialog: out of here. There's blood all

dialog: coat.
dialog:

speaker_heading: PRYCE

dialog: 
text: BANG!BANG! Bullets zip by Keller, who rolls for cover

dialog: 
text: Keller spots Carrie over by the Cat. She fires
text: continually, forcing him to stay behind cover. The shots
text: go wide -- she's not yet used to firing with the right
dialog: hand.
dialog: 
text: Keller blindly reaches his gun around the chest -- shoots
dialog: back, which --
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Carrie keeps shooting. Bullets PING OFF THE TOOL CHEST.
text: They stop. Carrie has to reload.
dialog:

text: attached to it. Slams it.
dialog: 
text: HANGAR DOORS BEGIN TO RUMBLE OPEN

dialog: many times have we both talked
dialog: about having a fresh start. Well,
dialog: this is it. Those beakers finding

dialog:

speaker_heading: CARRIE (cont'd)

dialog: 
text: Disappears into the blanket of white.
dialog: 
text: Wind and cold storm into the room against Carrie, who

text: drained. Numb. Freezing to death -- tears frozen to her
dialog: cheeks.
dialog: 
text: A shadow passes by her -- it's Pryce. He's hunkered over
text: in pain, but forcing himself against the driving force of
text: the wind into the Ready Room.
dialog: 
text: Latches onto the door. It takes everything he's got, but
text: he manages to get it closed. Instant silence.
dialog: 
text: Cold to the bone, he grabs a jacket off the racket.
