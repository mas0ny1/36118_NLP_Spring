dialog: 
dialog: EYES. Expressive, alive. Human?
text: No. They belong to a FEMALE CHIMPANZEE: BRIGHT EYES.
scene_heading: EXT. GROVE OF TREES -- DAY
text: She sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular,
text: a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE A
text: SHOOTING STAR.
text: Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF
text: CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays.
scene_heading: EXT. WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY
text: A DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle.
text: They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance.
text: As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving
text: quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready.
scene_heading: EXT. CANOPY - DAY
text: Alpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight.
text: He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR
text: ignites the community - but too late.
text: POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up
text: dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER.
text: Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his
text: teeth and sends her off.
text: Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All
text: around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging.
text: MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -
text: an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe.
text: Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG
text: CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER
text: FROM HIS MOUNT.
text: Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to
text: rally a counter-attack.
text: But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to
text: the defense. It's chaos.
text: SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by
text: one. Others take off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
text: Alpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing, dragged off in a
text: net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air...
text: A SHOT RINGS OUT.
scene_heading: BRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THE
text: AIR AND FALLS TO THE GROUND. LIKE A STONE.
speaker_heading: FADE TO WHITE
text: TWO FACES wearing SURGICAL MASKS lean in and peer down at us.
text: FRANKLIN - broken horn-rimmed glasses - and CAROLINE - curly
text: red hair under a sterile cap.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Nanotherapy, beta version: Tuesday,
dialog: March 10, 2011. Female Test
dialog: subject Number four.
text: Franklin reaches for us, smiles...
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Here we go, Bright eyes.
text: A MIST fogs our view for a moment.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Not too much. She needs to be
text: calm, but alert.
scene_heading: VOICE THROUGH INTERCOM
dialog: Go ahead - send her through.
text: A LOUD HUM and we start moving, sliding into a tunnel a
text: tubular CT SCAN - with a MIRROR on the top.
text: Now WE SEE OUR FACE REFLECTED: A FEMALE APE IN A GAS MASK.
dialog: Bright Eyes.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME
text: WILL RODMAN - late twenties, lab coat over a T-shirt and
text: jeans - stands at the glass, watching the terrified
text: chimpanzee slide into the machine.
text: The focus in his eyes belies the casual dress.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Start the scan.
text: A TECHIE sits at a computer screen beside Will.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: TECHIE
text: Scanning.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE ROOM -- DAY
text: Another tech, DONNIE - skinny, tattooed - controls the
text: machine, sending the restrained animal into the scanner.
text: Caroline moves to an IV STAND beside the scan. The bag's
text: full of a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN LIQUID.
speaker_heading: DONNIE
text: Stuff looks like Kool-aid.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Go ahead, I'm sure you could use
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: (OPENING VALVE)
dialog: Starting the therapy...
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME
text: Will looks at a monitor showing the BRAIN SCAN OF THE CHIMP.
text: The image starts to shake. Concerned, he looks to the other
text: room - where he can see the CHIMP'S LEGS SHAKING IN THEIR
speaker_heading: RESTRAINTS.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
text: She's convulsing.
text: Caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube, listens to Bright
text: Eyes' heart.
speaker_heading: WILL
speaker_heading: (INTO INTERCOM)
dialog: Please keep the monkey still.
text: He focuses back on the monitor.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE (INTERCOM)
dialog: She's not a monkey.
text: Will looks from the monitor to Caroline. His look is
text: intense, tough to read. She blushes slightly at the heat of
text: his gaze.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE (INTERCOM) (CONT'D)
dialog: She's an ape. Chimpanzees,
dialog: gorillas and orangutans, they're
dialog: all apes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Good to know. Just keep it from
dialog: moving.
text: She's stung, wonders, why does he have to be such a jerk
dialog: sometimes.
text: He's oblivious to this, instead intent on getting the scan
text: right. The green liquid moves through the chimp's neck...
speaker_heading: TECHIE
dialog: Here we go.
text: Will stares at the scan, his eyes willing the test to
text: succeed.. .the green liquid LIGHTS UP THE CHIMP'S BRAIN.
text: CHEER FROM THE GROUP.
text: Will fights a CONTRACTION OF EXTREME EMOTION that passes
text: across his face. He quickly hides it - offers up a smile for
dialog: the others.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We're on our way.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Good work.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: What is this?
text: Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes, who
text: sits at a table in front of a LEXIGRAM, a lit-up board with
text: colorful symbols.
text: Bright Eyes presses a button.
speaker_heading: ELECTRONIC VOICE
dialog: Tree.
scene_heading: SUPER: "ONE MONTH LATER."
text: Caroline holds up a picture of an acorn.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: And this?
text: The chimp presses another button.
speaker_heading: ELECTRONIC VOICE
dialog: Acorn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Where does the acorn come from?
text: Bright Eyes considers... then presses a button.
speaker_heading: ELECTRONIC VOICE
dialog: Acorn.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Yes, but where does the acorn come
dialog: from?
speaker_heading: ELECTRONIC VOICE
dialog: Acorn.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: NO -
text: Bright Eyes interrupts, now pressing three buttons.
speaker_heading: ELECTRONIC VOICE
text: Acorn. Tree. Acorn.
text: The chimp looks at Caroline, who's stunned, trying to process
text: the ADVANCED THINKING JUST MANIFESTED. Then she presses
dialog: another button.
speaker_heading: ELECTRONIC VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Surprise.
text: The unnatural voice - paired with Bright Eyes' eerily human-
text: like gaze - is somehow CREEPY... The IMAGE FREEZES and we...
scene_heading: PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WILL'S OFFICE
text: Diplomas on the wall, books everywhere. Bright Eyes looks
text: out at Will from a computer screen. He's got two CT SCANS
text: sitting on the desk in front of him.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: We started the therapy four weeks
dialog: ago. This was yesterday.
text: Will's studying the scans. They look good. Real good.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE (CONT'D)
dialog: There's been clear cell growth.
dialog: Both on the frontal lobe and the
text: neocortex.
text: She's purposely standing close in order to point this out.
text: He notices but doesn't respond - there's history between them
text: and he's regretting that - gets in the way.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I see that. But I don't understand
dialog: the primate behavioral norms. She
dialog: knows an acorn's a seed. Wouldn't
dialog: any monkey know that?
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: No - it's conceptual. Acorn gives
text: us a tree, which gives us an acorn.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Abstract thought...
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
text: In a chimpanzee. Unheard of.
text: Will turns the possibilities over in his mind. Caroline
text: moves away from him. He barely notices her now.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're calling her a monkey just to
dialog: piss me off, aren't you?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Start the other's on the 112.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And double this one's dose.
scene_heading: EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DUSK
text: Will climbs into his truck. Alone, he allows his excitement
dialog: to show. Abstract thought!
text: He pulls away from the BIO LAB, which is tucked in a corner
text: of an old military base.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DUSK (AERIAL)
text: Will drives over the majestic Golden Gate Bridge.
scene_heading: EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Will pulls up in front of his house.
text: Set in a hillside neighborhood, it's neat, nondescript. The
text: home of a bachelor who hasn't given it much thought.
text: As Will pulls into the driveway, WE HEAR C SHARP PLAYED OVER
text: AND OVER ON A PIANO.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: WALTER RODMAN, 60, sits at the piano dressed in a robe,
text: stabbing at the key with his finger.
text: Will enters, his posture almost visually changing with the
dialog: emotional weight of this man, his father.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hey Dad.
text: Walter looks up, whispers...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: John... is that you?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's me. Will.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: As thou dost, Anthony.
dialog: (staring at the keys)
dialog: .he hears no music. No music...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (heavy Russian accent)
dialog: He's been doing that all day.
text: A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: He found an old book of his.
text: She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's
text: pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back.
speaker_heading: IRENA (CONT'D)
dialog: (shrugging on coat)
dialog: I had no idea you liked Shakespeare
dialog: so much, Mr. Walter.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: My mother was the one. She liked
dialog: Shakespeare...
speaker_heading: IRENA
speaker_heading: (KISSES HIM)
dialog: Good night, Walter, hone-ee.
text: She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm.
speaker_heading: I WILL
dialog: Come on, Dad.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
scene_heading: INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Will helps his father change into pajamas.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Remember I told you we were using
dialog: Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on
dialog: the apes? Well the therapy seems
dialog: to be working. We've seen definite
text: signs of adult brain neurogenesis.
text: Walter holds up his arms for Will to slide on the pajama top.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Board of Directors is coming in a
dialog: couple weeks to talk about Phase 2 -
dialog: that's clinical trials.
text: Walter gives no hint he's even listening, much less
text: understanding what Will's saying.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Human trials, Dad. Soon.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I rather tell that what is to be
dialog: feared than what I fear: for
dialog: always... I am Caesar...
text: There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries..
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm going to make you better - I
dialog: swear it.
text: His father looks at him. A moment of recognition?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: John... ?
speaker_heading: WILL
speaker_heading: (DISAPPOINTED)
dialog: No, Dad, it's me. Will.
text: Will helps the old man under the bedcovers.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: John's gone.
text: He moves to the door, pausing to take in the diplomas on the
dialog: walls - Walter's name on all of them. (Physics, Astronomy.)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
text: Will looks at his father lying there on his back, staring up
text: at the ceiling. The once brilliant man now slipping away.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S STUDY - LATE NIGHT
text: It's late. Signs of a half-eaten frozen dinner on the desk
text: beside numerous papers, charts, and Will's computer.
text: He looks exhausted, gulps from a cup of coffee as he works.
scene_heading: INT. PRIMATE LAB - DAY
text: Franklin moves from cage to cage, greeting the apes.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam.
dialog: Monty. Hey - what's the matter,
dialog: don't like my cooking?
scene_heading: SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER
text: He pauses in front of Bright Eyes, huddled at the back of her
dialog: cage.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay back there?
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Something wrong with Bright Eyes?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I'll check on her when we're done.
text: Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the
text: next room, where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner.
text: Lucky's head is shaved, exposing a long, curving scar on his
text: cranium.
text: From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open
text: door as Lucky's strapped down.
scene_heading: EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - SAME
text: Will - dressed in an ill-fitting suit off the rack, hair
text: brushed in an attempt at neatness - meets STEVEN JACOBS as he
text: steps from a beautiful BLACK JAGUAR.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: You could at least try to look
dialog: excited.
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
text: Will's too nervous to look excited. He eyes the FOUR SUITS
text: disembarking from nearby TOWN CARS.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm not good with this stuff.
text: Jacobs puts a hand on Will's back, leads him inside.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: You'll do fine. Just speak
dialog: English. Keep the science simple.
scene_heading: INT. LAB - SAME
text: From the back of her cage, Bright Eyes watches through the
text: open door as the ape on the table convulses.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Okay. Back it out...
speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: Your turn.
text: Bright Eyes RUSHES FORWARD, HER HANDS GRIPPING THE BARS SO
text: DONNIE CAN'T OPEN THE CAGE.
speaker_heading: DONNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon - Let go -
dialog: She understands what he wants but she won't do it. THAT'S
text: WHEN HE NOTICES: HER HANDS ARE BLOODY.
speaker_heading: DONNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! Something's wrong with number
dialog: four!
text: Franklin looks over - he's still dealing with Lucky on the
dialog: table...
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Be right over -
text: Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes. There's something
dialog: different in her face today. Rage? Force of will?
speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: What's the matter with you?
scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM - SAME
text: Will stands at the head of a table. A BIG PLASMA SCREEN
text: behind him shows a BLOW UP OF A BRAIN SCAN. As Will speaks,
text: he gestures at it with a LASER POINTER.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: 0
speaker_heading: (AWKWARD)
dialog: Alzheimer's affects the entire
dialog: neocortex, the hippocampus, and
dialog: large subcortical regions of the
dialog: brain...
scene_heading: INT. LAB - SAME
text: Donnie and Bright Eyes are at a standoff. Once more he tries
text: to open the cage, once more she yanks it shut.
text: Again he tries... and is taken by surprise when SHE GRABS HIS
text: HAND AND PULLS IT THROUGH THE BARS.
speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: Hey!!!
text: Now Donnie's smashed up against the bars. Hard. The other
text: apes begin to SCREECH.
text: Donnie hasn't panicked quite yet, but he's about to.
speaker_heading: DONNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Someone get her off of me!
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Hang on -
text: Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries
text: over. He eyes the chimps in their cages - GOING CRAZY.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM - DAY
text: Will continues his presentation. Stevens looks around at the
dialog: board members - they're lost.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: In the past, it's been impossible
dialog: to target specific areas, both
dialog: because of the Blood Brain Barrier -
text: Jacobs stands, interrupting Will.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: What Dr. Rodman has done is to
dialog: invent a virus that can, for the
dialog: first time, cross the membrane that
dialog: protects the brain and deliver a
dialog: genetic, therapeutic, payload.
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (trying to sell)
dialog: This 'payload' would directly
dialog: affect the areas of memory, higher
dialog: function - and, of course, the
dialog: motherlode: intelligence.
text: The board members stare, trying to comprehend.
speaker_heading: BOARD MEMBER
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Meaning.
dialog: (deep breath here)
dialog: If Phase 2 goes as planned, we're
text: looking at a cure for Alzheimer's.
text: With an elbow prompting from Jacobs, Will takes a SAMPLE VIAL
text: from his jacket pocket and awkwardly holds it up for dramatic
dialog: effect.
scene_heading: INT. LAB - DAY
speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: She's breaking my hand!
speaker_heading: CAROLINE
dialog: Let go, Bright Eyes! You're
dialog: hurting him!
text: She tries to help pull Donnie away.
speaker_heading: CAROLINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let go!
text: In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own.
text: LUCKY - RILED UP FROM THE COMMOTION IN BRIGHT EYES' CAGE AND
text: THE SCREAMING FROM THE OTHER CHIMPS - BREAKS AWAY.
text: HE CRASHES OUT OF THE LAB, DRAGGING HIS LEASH.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Lucky no! Stop!
speaker_heading: (TO CAROLINE)
dialog: Hit the alarm!
text: Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it.
text: DONNIE'S SCREAMS BECOME OTHERWORLDLY AS WE GO TO...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: INT. LAB SECURITY ROOM - SAME
text: LOUD BEEPING as two GUARDS look to a BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN
text: of a corridor. They see Lucky dragging his leash as he
text: scampers - unattended - down the hall.
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: Uh oh.
text: Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN
text: SILENT AGONY, PUSHED UP AGAINST THE CAGE, CAROLINE TRYING TO
text: GET HIM FREE.
speaker_heading: GUARD #2
dialog: Hey, Len...?
text: Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket...
text: Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet...
scene_heading: EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - DAY
text: Lucky BURSTS from the lab building and runs across the
text: grounds. He leaps over a car, then heads for the nearest
dialog: building.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM - DAY
text: The room is still thrumming with the excitement of Will's
dialog: pronouncement.
speaker_heading: BOARD MEMBER
dialog: What about the safety of the virus?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Perfectly safe. We're using the
dialog: most stable -
text: A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS.
text: Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: NO!
text: Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and
text: pinning him to the wall. It happens fast.
text: The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw, exposing DEADLY
text: INCISORS...
text: â¢ BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK.
text: The chimp turns, leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
text: Will watches as the chimp - and all of Will's dreams -
text: collapses on the boardroom table.
scene_heading: EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - NIGHT
text: Rain and fog. An AMBULANCE pulls out, past POLICE CRUISERS
scene_heading: and two CDC (CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL) VANS.
text: Will - face cut, clothing torn - finishes with a DETECTIVE
text: and walks through the chaotic aftermath. He watches Caroline
text: walk alongside a stretcher carrying Donnie, his shoulder
text: packed in ice.
text: He spots Jacobs, who looks wrecked. He hurries over to him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Are they gone?
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: Long gone.
text: Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Did they say anything before they
dialog: left? I mean, about Phase 2.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: Look around you, for Christ sakes.
dialog: We'll be lucky if we don't go to
dialog: jail.
text: Will's gutted - devastated.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But we're so close.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: You think you're the only one who's
dialog: got something at stake here? I've
dialog: got my own skin in this game!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What happened had nothing to do
dialog: with the 112.
dialog: (desperate to clarify)
dialog: Take an already aggressive animal,
dialog: make it smarter - you're going to
dialog: get a potentially dangerous
speaker_heading: SITUATION -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: What makes you so damned positive
dialog: about that?
dialog: (pauses for emphasis)
dialog: What if this drug does things you
dialog: don't understand? Are you going to
dialog: take responsibility for that?
dialog: Because I'm sure as hell not going
dialog: to.
text: Here Will hesitates.
speaker_heading: JACOBS (CONT'D)
dialog: We're not ready for human trials.
dialog: Hell, we weren't ready for monkey
dialog: trials.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: They're apes.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: This is what we're going to do:
dialog: You're taking a sabbatical. I'll
dialog: let the board handle the lawsuit.
dialog: When this blows over I'll bring you
dialog: back and we'll start over - we'll
dialog: do it right this time. With mice.
dialog: Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody.
text: Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say.
scene_heading: INT. LAB REFRIGERATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Will stands at the fringes of the room, watching MEN IN
text: HAZMAT SUITS pull down SHELVES OF METAL CANISTERS LABELED ADV
dialog: 112.
dialog: His work - destroyed.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK LOT, BEHIND THE LAB - NIGHT
text: Will climbs into his truck and pauses. He reaches into a
text: jacket pocket and brings out a VIAL - IT'S THE VIAL of 112 HE
scene_heading: USED IN THE PRESENTATION - THE ONLY REMAINING ONE.
text: TAP AT THE WINDOW. Franklin's face appears.
text: Will shoves the VIAL back into his pocket, rolls down the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: Â¢ FRANKLIN
dialog: Show you something, boss?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don't work here anymore,
dialog: Franklin.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I just put down fifteen animals,
dialog: Dr. Rodman. The least you could do
dialog: is give me a moment of your time.
text: Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long,
dialog: devastating day.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: of course.
scene_heading: INT. PRIMATE LAB - NIGHT
text: The cages are empty, the doors open. Will notes used
text: SYRINGES on the table, filled body bags lined up on the
dialog: floor.
text: It's a creepy, horrible scene.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: They're all gone.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm sorry, Franklin. Genuinely
dialog: sorry...
dialog: What's he got to do to get the hell out of there?
text: Franklin ignores him, steps inside Bright Eyes' cage. He
text: moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket.
text: At first Will doesn't understand what he's looking at. The
text: lighting's dim and the thing's so small...
text: But then IT MOVES AND WILL REALIZES HE'S LOOKING AT AN INFANT
speaker_heading: CHIMPANZEE.
text: Will stares at it for a long moment, his brain overloaded.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's impossible. How could a full-
dialog: term gestation go unnoticed?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: They carry small. Must have been
dialog: pregnant when they brought her in.
text: Will tries to get his mind around the situation.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Who else knows about this?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: No one.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'd bring him home, but my brother-
dialog: in-law works for security. He'd
dialog: rat me out in a second.
dialog: That's when will realizes.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You want me to take him?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: He's an orphan now.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I could be thrown in jail. He's a
text: chimpanzee who's been exposed to a
dialog: possibly dangerous drug.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: You don't believe that.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Doesn't matter what I believe.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Just for a couple days. Until I
dialog: can find a sanctuary.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's not possible.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I heard you outside, fighting to
dialog: keep them alive.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I was talking about the work, my
speaker_heading: RESEARCH -
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
text: she was just trying to protect him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What?
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Bright Eyes - the mother. That's
dialog: why she wouldn't let anyone into
dialog: her cage.
text: Will looks down at the helpless baby.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry -
dialog: but there's nothing I can do here.
dialog: He's got to be put down like the
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Tell you what, Doc.
dialog: (producing a syringe)
dialog: I'm done for the day. So you be my
dialog: guest.
text: Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will.
text: It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He
text: enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his
dialog: little hands.
text: Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's
dialog: belly... but there's no way he can go through with this.
text: Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who
text: watches from outside the cage.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Two days. Then you have to figure
dialog: it out.
scene_heading: INT. WALMART - NIGHT
text: A BOX OF DIAPERS pulled from the shelf and tossed into a
dialog: cart.
text: Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered
text: in a blanket - plastered to his chest.
text: He stops at the powdered formulas, overwhelmed by the array
dialog: of choices.
scene_heading: INT. WALMART CHECK OUT - NIGHT
text: A TEEN rings up the baby goods.
speaker_heading: TEEN CASHIER
dialog: Hey man. Congratulations.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: Oh. Thanks.
scene_heading: EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Will pulls up in his truck.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
text: Will's coat is pulled forward to shield the baby at his
text: chest. He barely has the key in the lock when Irena opens
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: It's Friday night. I had a date.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm sorry - there was -
text: She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the
text: walk, her footfalls pointed and angry.
text: He pauses there. Apparently no end to this bad day.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Will dumps the baby goods on the counter, heads for the
text: refrigerator. The infant's still plastered to his chest.
text: He opens the fridge, grabs a crisper drawer, empties its
text: contents in the sink.
text: Then Will REACHES INTO HIS JACKET POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE
text: VIAL OF 112. CAREFULLY HE PLACES IT INTO THE DRAWER AND
text: ROLLS THE DRAWER BACK IN THE FRIDGE.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Will sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion. A HIGH PITCHED
text: WAIL comes from another part of the house.
text: Will sits up, remembering.
scene_heading: INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT
text: Will enters, half asleep, turns on the light. The baby chimp
text: lies in a cardboard box on the floor and he's obviously sick,
text: making UNNATURAL WHEEZING NOISES.
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
text: Will stares down at the little creature, trying to decide
dialog: what to do.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Will turns on the HOT WATER. SHUTS the door. Holding the
text: limp, feeble chimp in his arms, he puts down the toilet seat
dialog: and sits.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's okay. It's going to be okay.
text: Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit.
text: Will looks down at the chimp, struggling for breath. The
text: room fills with STEAM.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD. He stands at the top of
text: a tree, an alpha male, eyeing the CHIMPS around him.
text: In a sudden BURST of movement, the CHIMPANZEE TAKES OFF,
text: FLYING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH with tremendous force, a FREIGHT
scene_heading: TRAIN OF THREAT, POWER AND VIOLENCE.
text: Teeth bared in a terrifying display, the ape easily
text: intimidates all the chimps around him.
text: REVEAL THAT THE CHIMP IMAGES ARE YOU-TUBE AND WILL'S WATCHING
text: THEM ON HIS LAPTOP.
text: Abruptly he closes it. Looks down at the infant, so peaceful
text: in his arms.
scene_heading: SUPER: "TWO YEARS LATER"
text: SOUND of a TOILET FLUSH.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
text: The chimp - looking like a toddler - walks out of the
text: bathroom, hiking up a pair of shorts. WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH
text: THE HOUSE as he zig zags up and over furniture.
text: The house looks warmer, cluttered, more lived-in.
text: The chimp arrives at a hallway, where he leaps into the air
text: and grabs hold of a CORD that hangs from the ceiling.
text: As his weight pulls it down, there's a SQUEAK and a FOLD DOWN
text: LADDER opens from above. WE FOLLOW HIM up the ladder into...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: â¢INT. ATTIC -- DAY
text: .the attic. Beams of light streaming through a LARGE VENT
text: TO THE OUTSIDE. Rings and pegs for climbing are set into the
text: walls. Toys, books and puzzles scattered across the floor.
text: SOUNDS of KIDS PLAYING and LAUGHING OUTSIDE.
text: The chimp heads for the vent and peers through. WE GO OVER
text: HIS SHOULDER TO SEE...
scene_heading: EXT. THE OUTSIDE WORLD - DAY
text: From up here, the chimp has a commanding view of the entire
text: neighborhood. A group of CHILDREN rides bikes. A MAN mows
dialog: his lawn.
text: There's a HONK below, and the chimp watches as a TAXI pulls
text: up to the HOUSE NEXT DOOR.
text: HUNSIKER - A MAN in an AIRLINE PILOT uniform - kisses his
text: WIFE and young DAUGHTER, ALICE, then climbs into the cab with
text: his carry-on suitcase.
text: Alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddy's
text: Taxi disappear around the corner... Then TODD, the big
text: brother, SWIPES THE DOLL FROM HER HAND and rides off on his
text: bike. His FRIENDS LAUGH.
text: The chimp watches, riveted, as the Alice BURSTS INTO OUTRAGED
text: TEARS and runs after them.
speaker_heading: WILL (O.S.)
dialog: Caesar! Breakfast!
text: The chimp turns at Will's call. HIS NAME IS CAESAR.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
text: Will comes away from the ladder, heads for the kitchen.
text: The living room floor is strewn with puzzles and games. One
text: of them has been completed. Will considers it, looks around
dialog: for the box, reads the side...
dialog: AGES 12 and up. 12 and up.
text: Caesar runs past, jumps onto d chair at the kitchen table,
text: picks up a fork and starts eating his eggs and potatoes.
text: Will walks over, sits across from him.
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: WILL

text: Caesar slides the ketchup to Will.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (using American Sign
speaker_heading: LANGUAGE)
dialog: You're welcome.
dialog: NOTE: Whenever Caesar communicates he's signing and there
dialog: will be subtitles.
scene_heading: INT. GEN-SYS LAB - DAY
text: A MOUSE moves through a maze as a LAB TECH marks its
text: progress. Will - in a lab coat - watches with intensity.
text: The mouse moves effortlessly through the maze until it
text: reaches an ORANGE CONE at a crossroads. The mouse stops,
text: studies the cone.
speaker_heading: LAB TECH
dialog: Is he going to turn left or
dialog: right...?
text: The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a
text: piece of cheese. Will does his best to hide the excitement
text: blooming on his face.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: There it is. Restored cognitive
dialog: function.
speaker_heading: LAB TECH
dialog: Same success rate as the primates.
dialog: Congratulations.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY
text: VISITORS buy tickets at the entrance gates. Will pulls

scene_heading: INT. PRIMATE INFIRMARY, SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY
text: Dr. Molly Stewart - late 20's, pretty tomboy -- finishes
dialog: taking Caesar's blood pressure.

speaker_heading: Â¢ STEWART
text: He's right on target. Height.
dialog: Weight...
text: She checks Caesar's ears.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Dairy Queen.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: After. Sit still.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: What about diet?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: A healthy diet. Fruits,
dialog: vegetables.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Ice cream.
text: Will ignores him.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: What's he saying?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: He's hungry.
text: Caesar's angling to climb off the examining table. Will
text: sends him a look - out it out.
speaker_heading: STEWART
text: He seems extremely intelligent.
dialog: How many words does Caesar sign?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You know, the basics.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Soft-serve.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: I've heard of apes learning up to a
dialog: hundred and fifty words. Is he
dialog: good with puzzles?
text: Will hesitates.
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He's pretty good.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Well, Caesar's healthy, obviously
dialog: happy. You're doing a great job
dialog: with him.
dialog: (doesn't want to alarm)
dialog: But there is an anomaly I noticed.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: When I was examining his eyes, I
dialog: noticed a strange green
dialog: pigmentation.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Green?
text: His heart starts to pound.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Green. Never.seen it before.
text: She hands Will an OTOSCOPE.
speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: Take a look.
text: Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough, finds
scene_heading: FLECKS OF BRIGHT GREEN PIGMENTATION - JUST LIKE THE 112.
speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: It's faint, can you pick it up?
text: He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned. She eyes him.
speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: You alright? Want a glass of
dialog: water?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)
dialog: Sure, that would be good.
text: She gets him one. Concerned, Caesar comes over.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Forgot to eat today. Not a big
dialog: deal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
text: Stewart hands him the glass. He downs it.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO CAESAR)
dialog: I'm fine.
text: Stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck. Feels good.
speaker_heading: STEWART
text: Carotid pulse is running a little
dialog: fast.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: For a human or a chimpanzee?
text: First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Gotta remember to eat.
scene_heading: INT. MOVING CAR - DAY
text: Will drives Caesar, both of them licking soft-serve ice cream
text: cones. He pulls up outside a store: "SMART CHILD"
scene_heading: EDUCATIONAL TESTING TOYS.
speaker_heading: WILL (O.S.)
dialog: You have to move the whole tower to
text: another peg, one block at a time.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Walter's parked in front of the TV, not watching it.
text: Caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three
text: wooden poles. There are four colored blocks threaded on the
text: first pole, stacked biggest to smallest, making a 'tower'.
text: Irena stands next to Will, watching Caesar. There's also a
text: CAMCORDER on a tripod.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Here's the hard part: you can't put
text: a larger block on top of a smaller
dialog: one.
text: Caesar studies the puzzle.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Understand?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
text: Caesar's already started. He methodically begins moving
text: blocks from one pole to another, pausing, backtracking,
dialog: getting it right, never a bigger one on top of a smaller...
text: Will watches, increasingly amazed, as he re-creates the tower
text: on a different pole. It's easy for him.
text: Finished, Caesar looks up at him. Will fumbles in his
scene_heading: pocket, HANDS CAESAR SOME M&amp;MS.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (STUNNED)
dialog: He did it in fifteen moves.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: What's the best score?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Fifteen.
text: Will looks over at Walter, who's staring at the wall.
speaker_heading: IRENA
speaker_heading: (AMAZED)
dialog: I wonder where he gets such talent?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (eyes on Walter)
dialog: It was passed down from his mother.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: Will uploads the MPEG video of Caesar doing the puzzle and
text: prepares to record an AUDIO ATTACHMENT.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (into computer mic)
text: At age two Caesar appears to exceed
text: his mother's aptitude. He signs
text: over three hundred words. He
dialog: exhibits no visible side effects
dialog: from the therapy...
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Will flips on a light. Enters. Closes the door behind him.
text: Taking a key from his pocket he approaches a SMALL, PADLOCKED
text: REFRIGERATOR and unlocks it. Opens the door.
scene_heading: Inside-WE SEE: THE SINGLE VIAL OF ADV 112.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Will sits on the edge of the sofa, the VIAL of 112 in his
text: hand. He's deep in agonized thought.
text: Finally he takes a SYRINGE and FILLS IT WITH THE GREEN
text: LIQUID. Then he stands, walks to a closed door.
scene_heading: INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: The opening door sends a wash of light into the dark room.
text: Walter's in bed. He opens his eyes, squinting at the
dialog: brightness.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (syringe in hand)
dialog: Dad. I've got something that's
dialog: going to make you better.
text: Will closes the door behind him. WE HEAR A RHYTHMIC
dialog: SQUEAKING NOISE as we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - DAY
text: The movement of a SWING. Caesar's strapped in it, and WE
text: NOTICE IMMEDIATELY THAT HE'S GROWN OLDER.
scene_heading: SUPER: TWO YEARS LATER
text: Caesar's features are more mature. He appears more like a
text: "little boy" - and his EYES HAVE TURNED A DEEP GREEN.
text: Back and forth Caesar goes, as high as he can manage.
text: At the height of his forward motion, he peers down into the
text: neighbor's yard where, for just an instant, HE CAN SEE TODD
text: PLAYING BALL WITH ALICE AND ANOTHER KID.
text: At the height of his backward motion he catches another
dialog: glimpse.
text: Caesar pumps his legs, eager to get a better look...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Will's making sandwiches, his eye on Caesar through the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (to someone offscreen)
dialog: You want turkey or ham?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Ham!
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: WE FIND WALTER just sitting down on the piano bench. He
text: begins playing a competent version of "CLAIR DE LUNE."
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Will pauses, listening to the MUSIC. He moves to the doorway
dialog: to watch his father.
text: The happiness - the relief - is clear on his face.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - DAY
text: SQUEAK.SQUEAK of the SWING, the PIANO FAINT from out here.
text: Caesar studies the harness that's keeping him in the swing.
text: There's a clamp on either side and a clamp on the back. He
text: undoes the one on his right side. CLICK. Then the left
text: side. CLICK.
text: Caesar wriggles the harness around so that he can reach the
text: clamp on his back with his long chimpanzee arms.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Will returns to his sandwich making. It takes him a moment
text: to notice that CAESAR HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SWING.
text: The color drains from his face.
scene_heading: EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY
text: Caesar stands at the edge of the yard, unsure what to do
text: next. All three kids - Todd, Alice and Todd's buddy - have
text: stopped playing to stare at him.
text: Caesar spots a BALL lying on the grass. He picks it up and
text: tosses it to Todd's Buddy. The Boy catches it, throws it
dialog: back to Caesar.
speaker_heading: TODD'S BUDDY
dialog: Check it. He wants to play.
text: Thrilled at the contact, Caesar throws the ball to Todd. But
text: Todd has an idea, and the idea makes him smile.
text: Alice doesn't have a good feeling. She watches as her
text: brother throws the ball to his Buddy OVER CAESAR'S HEAD.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: TODD
text: Monkey in the middle.
text: Todd's Buddy LAUGHS. Caesar LAUGHS too, although he's not
dialog: sure what's funny.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Will and Walter walk down the street looking for Caesar.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Caesar!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He won't go far.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You don't know that.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I do, Dad.
scene_heading: INT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY
text: Todd and his buddy throw the ball over Caesar's head, while
text: Caesar jumps to try and catch it.
speaker_heading: TODD AND FRIEND
text: Monkey in the middle, monkey in the
dialog: middle...
text: Caesar's having fun, unaware that the game has become keep-
text: away from him. Until he NOTICES ALICE'S EXPRESSION - SHE
text: FEELS SORRY FOR HIM.
text: THEN, IN A STOMACH-LURCHING MOMENT CAESAR REALIZES WHAT'S
text: GOING ON: HE'S THE BUTT OF A JOKE.
dialog: They're making fun of him.
text: "MONKEY", "MONKEY", "MONKEY"... The chanted words ring in
text: Caesar's ears. He drops his arms and walks over to Todd,
text: stepping close, hot rage escaping from his nostrils.
text: Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face.
text: Alice runs inside.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Will and Walter search down the street. Then they hear it:
text: â¢ HUNSIKER'S YELL. Will runs for the neighbor's house.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY
text: Hunsiker approaches Caesar with a raised bat. The terrified
text: chimp backs toward his fence.
speaker_heading: HUNSIKER
dialog: Hah! Hah -
text: Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER
text: AND CAESAR. Caesar cowers behind him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hold on - it's okay - he's
dialog: harmless!
speaker_heading: HUNSIKER
dialog: Your monkey came onto my property!
dialog: Threatened my kids!
text: By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head
text: in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It won't happen again...
speaker_heading: HUNSIKER
dialog: Damn right it won't happen again!
dialog: I'll press charges if it does!
text: Will holds Caesar close and hurries home.
scene_heading: INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: What does he do for fun?
dialog: Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little
text: thrown by the question.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well we've got puzzles, games, a
dialog: swing set...
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: My guess is he needs more. More
dialog: exercise, more space.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We'll work on that.
text: Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen
text: to his heart. Closing her eyes for a moment, listening.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
text: He gets up his nerve.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What do you do for fun?
text: She opens her eyes, looks at him. He thinks she doesn't
dialog: understand the question.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: How about dinner and a movie?
text: Stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: I'm sorry, did you say something?
text: He starts to try again - but the moment's gone.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No - nothing.
text: Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed.
text: Stewart lingers a moment, certain she's missed something -
text: but Will doesn't say more.
scene_heading: EXT. MUIR WOODS, ESTABLISHING - DAY
text: From high above, WE PASS OVER the Golden Gate Bridge, the
text: link between the bustling city and a huge, green FOREST.
scene_heading: INT. MOVING CAR - DAY
text: Caesar - driving with Walter and Will -- looks out the window,
text: extremely excited.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DAY
text: As Caesar scrambles out of the truck, WILL HOOKS A HARNESS
text: TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car.
text: The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this
text: place? The three of them head into the forest, Caesar
text: tugging at the leash.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Take him off the leash.
speaker_heading: Â¢ WILL
text: There's a place up ahead.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DAY
dialog: They've walked deep into the park. No people here. Will
text: kneels next to Caesar.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Don't go far. Stay where I can see
dialog: you.
text: Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins
text: flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's
text: gratifying to see Caesar so happy.
text: The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then
text: another. The men follow... and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A
text: GROVE OF TREES.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (YELLING)
dialog: Remember - stay where I can see you
dialog: - if you got lost in these woods
dialog: I'd never find you.
text: BUT CAESAR BARELY HEARS HIM. HE'S UTTERLY CAPTIVATED. THE
text: SPOT IS BEAUTIFUL, WITH GREEN, LUSH BRANCHES JOINING TO FORM
text: A CANOPY OVERHEAD.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Go ahead. Climb!
text: The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the
text: branches. Free, elated. An animal in his element.
text: Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is
text: obscured by the leaves. As his dark form ascends, Will and
text: Walter become smaller and smaller down below.
scene_heading: SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER
text: RUSTLING LEAVES whisper Caesar upward. He moves with an easy
text: grace, exhilarated by the freedom.
text: At the TOP of the giant redwood CAESAR EMERGES THROUGH THE
text: LEAVES - AND WE SEE THAT HE'S GROWN, FILLED OUT - THE CHIMP
scene_heading: EQUIVALENT OF A FULL-BLOWN TEENAGER.
text: HIS DISTINCTIVE LOOKS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED NOW: EYES A DEEP
scene_heading: GREEN, FEATURES SOMEWHAT LESS SIMIAN, PERHAPS MORE HUMAN...
text: Caesar looks across the bay to San Francisco, looks north at
text: the mountains. Then down to Will below.
text: Will's pointing to his watch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
text: â¢ CLOSE ON A HARNESS. Will has it waiting as Caesar lands
text: beside him on the forest floor.
text: Will attaches the harness and they walk together. Caesar's
text: much taller now - over five feet.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Sorry to rush you - got to get home
dialog: and check on Walter.
text: They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT
text: DANE. The dog BARKS, lunging menacingly. The Woman
text: struggles to control him.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
speaker_heading: (INCREDULOUS)
dialog: Is that a chimpanzee?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Don't worry - he's harmless. Very
dialog: sweet.
text: The big dog keeps BARKING.
text: Annoyed, Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE,
scene_heading: CHIMPANZEE SNARL, BARING HIS TEETH.
text: The Great Dane immediately WHIMPERS - terrified - and pulls
dialog: the Woman away.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess he had it coming.
text: Caesar watches as the Woman walks off with the dog, HIS GAZE
text: LINGERING ON THE LEASH.
text: THEN HIS EYES MOVE TO HIS OWN LEASH. Is he a pet too?
scene_heading: EXT. ZOO - DAY
text: Will drives up, Caesar in tow. The ZOO'S BEING RENOVATED -
text: machinery everywhere.
scene_heading: INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Will leads Caesar inside the examination room - and finds
text: himself face to face with a YOUNG MALE VETERINARIAN.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Where's Dr. Stewart?
speaker_heading: S VETERINARIAN
dialog: She doesn't work here anymore.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: Doesn't work here anymore?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do you know where she went?
speaker_heading: VETERINARIAN
dialog: I'm sorry - I don't.
text: Will's deeply disappointed.
scene_heading: EXT. ZOO - DAY
text: Disoriented because of the construction, Will makes a wrong
text: turn as he leads Caesar to the car.
text: They find themselves in front of THE PRIMATE ENCLOSURE.
text: Caesar goes rigid, staring at a DOZEN CHIMPS in the branches
text: of the trees - behind bars. They stare back at him. One
scene_heading: CHIMP, a GRIZZLED OLD MALE, STEPS FORWARD - OMINOUS. HE
text: LOOKS AT CAESAR AS IF LOOKING INTO HIS SOUL.
text: Caesar's transfixed.
text: Will looks back and forth between the chimps and Caesar.
text: Neither makes a sound.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Come on.
text: As Will drags Caesar off, the apes in the enclosure climb
text: higher in the tree to watch. Suddenly they ALL BEGIN TO
text: SCREAM IN A DEAFENING CHATTER.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - DAY
text: Caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood TEENAGERS
dialog: walk home from school.
text: One BOY walks with a blonde teenage GIRL, books clutched to
text: her chest. Caesar watches the Boy flirt with her. The girl
text: smiles, flirts back.
text: One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head.
text: The BOY SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER and returns to the girl.
text: Caesar's fascinated by these antics. He wants to be with
dialog: these teens. He wants to be one of them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Caesar stands in front of a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, shirtless.
text: He stands up straight, like a human. Tries to imitate their
text: posture, their gait.
text: BUT FROM THE MIRROR A CHIMPANZEE STARES BACK AT HIM. A
text: CHIMPANZEE WITH GREEN EYES.
scene_heading: THERE'S A PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ON HIS SHOULDER - JUST
speaker_heading: LIKE ALPHA'S.
text: He runs two fingers down the length of it.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Caesar, Walter and Will sit at the dinner table. There's
dialog: tension here, but we can't place it yet.
text: Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S
text: USING THE WRONG END OF THE SPOON. He clutches the utensil,
text: staring at it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Turn it around, Dad. You're using
dialog: the wrong end.
text: Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending.
text: With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the

text: A LAB TECH makes a note. Will and Jacobs stand behind him,

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Sure. At this pace we'll get to

speaker_heading: JACOBS

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: JACOBS

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: JACOBS

speaker_heading: WILL
speaker_heading: (EVASIVE)

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (into computer mic)
dialog: Caesar continues to maintain a high

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Who.
text: With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and

speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Who.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Caesar is an ape.
speaker_heading: (SIGNING)
text: A chimpanzee.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No "what". "Who".
text: Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Are you asking about your identity?

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - DAY

text: birthmark - like a falling star - WE REALIZE it's a self-
dialog: portrait.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - DAY
text: The Home Aide lights herself a cigarette, sits down on a deck
dialog: chair.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: TV's still blaring, but the sofa's empty.
text: REVEAL Walter, standing in the middle of the room, confused.
text: As if he's not sure where he is.
text: Abruptly he turns and heads across the room... and OUT THE
speaker_heading: FRONT DOOR.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Walter pauses on the porch, blinking in the sun. The street
text: ahead of him is quiet. No one around.
text: Walter wanders down the front path. When he arrives at the
text: sidewalk he keeps on going, STEPPING OUT INTO THE STREET.
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
text: He's immediately startled by a SUDDEN HONK, the SOUND of
text: SQUEALING BRAKES, and a car fishtailing out of control. The
text: car SMASHES into a nearby tree.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - DAY
text: Hearing the CRASH, Caesar jumps to his feet, rushes to the
text: vent. He sees Hunsiker emerge from the smashed car, unhurt.
text: Caesar watches as Hunsiker inspects the ruined front fender,
text: then turns to YELL at someone.
text: That's when Walter comes into Caesar's view.
text: He's in the street, afraid, disoriented - while Hunsiker
text: rages, jabbing a threatening finger towards Walter's chest.
text: In a flash Caesar's down the attic stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Walter backs up as Hunsiker approaches, still jabbing the
text: menacing finger.
speaker_heading: HUNSIKER
dialog: Look at the front of my car you
dialog: stupid, stupid old man! You should
dialog: be locked up! Your son's going to

text: No time for anybody to react. The chimpanzee BODY SLAMS

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Caesar...
text: Straddling Hunsiker, teeth bared, Caesar pounds him with his
dialog: fists.
speaker_heading: HUNSIKER
dialog: Help! Get him off -
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Caesar... no... Stop!
text: Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back.
text: But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old
text: man off his back.
text: Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and BITES OFF THE
scene_heading: "JABBING" POINTER FINGER.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: HUNSIKER
dialog: Aaaaaaaah!
text: Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE
text: OF HUNSIKER'S BLOOD STREAKS ACROSS HIS NECK.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Caesar!
text: Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks
text: over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Please stop.
text: Hunsiker uses the distraction. He scrabbles to his feet and
text: sprints for his house.
scene_heading: CAESAR CATCHES A GLIMPSE. ANIMAL INSTINCT TAKES OVER - IT'S

scene_heading: EXT. HUNSIKER'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Just as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar
text: flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to
text: block Hunsiker's entrance.
text: White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to
text: his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Hunsiker runs for his life. He looks over his shoulder -
text: Caesar's galloping behind, in hot pursuit.
text: He tries to speed up - can't go any faster. Again he glances
text: over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in.
text: Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to
text: escape. He looks over his shoulder-but this time CAESAR
text: HAS DISAPPEARED. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE, UP OR DOWN THE STREET.
text: Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running.
text: Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE. HE
text: LANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER, BLOCKING HIS PATH.
text: Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street.

text: Enjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree

text: the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey.
text: Hunsiker's running out of steam. Caesar swings down in front
text: of him and KICKS him in the chest, sending him flying.
text: Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers.
speaker_heading: HUNSIKER
dialog: Please no...
text: Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph.
text: But then he sees something across the street that abruptly
text: pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY -
text: BEING HELPED TO HIS FEET.
text: He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing.

speaker_heading: MR. LANDON

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Go ahead.

scene_heading: EXT. ATRIUM - DAY
text: Caesar scampers up the ledges and leaps to a bar. He swings

scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE CAGED ATRIUM - DAY
text: Will can barely watch AS DODGE ROLLS THE SLIDING DOOR CLOSED,
text: LOCKING IT.
text: He braces himself.
scene_heading: EXT. ATRIUM - DAY
text: Caesar joyfully climbs the sprawling tree until he HITS THE
text: TOP OF THE CAGE. Branches continue through spaces in the

text: A DEAD END.
text: CAESAR TURNS, FINDS WILL'BELOW. What he reads in Will's eyes
text: gives him a sudden, sharp sense of dread.
text: HE LOOKS TO THE CAGE ENTRANCE, SEES THAT THE GATE IS LOCKED.
text: HE'S LOCKED IN. TRAPPED.
text: Caesar SHRIEKS, speeds down the tree.
text: Other SHRIEKS join in. EXCITED APE NOISES - coming from
text: UNSEEN, CAGED APES - fills the atrium.
text: The STRANGE ANIMAL VOICES FUEL CAESAR'S PANIC. He runs to
text: the gate, tries to shake it open.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's okay, Caesar. It's going to
dialog: be okay...
text: The words are for him as much as Caesar.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)

dialog: WHAT? Caesar can't believe what he's hearing! He
text: frantically signs, desperate, pleading.
text: The SHRIEKS of the UNSEEN APES continue, feeding Will's
dialog: apprehension. Caesar doesn't belong here. It takes every
dialog: bit of restraint he has not to take Caesar out, to run...
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: They'll take good care of you here.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: That's about it for visiting hours.
text: Will shoots him a look of daggers.
speaker_heading: MR. LANDON
dialog: What Dodge means is, in our
dialog: experience, longer you drag out the

text: Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this
text: doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm sorry to trick you this way,
dialog: but you would never have agreed. I
dialog: was afraid they'd hurt you if they

speaker_heading: MR. LANDON
dialog: He'll be fine.

scene_heading: INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY
text: .the Chimpanzee House - and stops in his tracks.

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Caesar - over here.

speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stupid monkey.

scene_heading: THE BETRAYAL.

text: He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE,
text: followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up.
text: In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR
text: CHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD
text: ACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN.
dialog: This is ROCKET.
text: He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage

text: He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a

scene_heading: SCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM!
text: A terrifying display of power and dominance.
speaker_heading: DODGE (O.S.)
dialog: Okay, assholes. Dinner time.

text: Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out.
text: Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to
text: cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in
text: an occasional rotted vegetable.
text: The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels
text: food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet-
text: looking dog food.
speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow.
dialog: Bet you don't get none of that in
dialog: the suburbs.
text: Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL
text: IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney
text: looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Think that's funny? That funny to

text: Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER.
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: Look at that!
text: Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: One thing you can count on: Long as
dialog: there are humans on this earth,
dialog: you'll always be a monkey in a
dialog: cage.
text: The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards.
text: Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his
text: back as a shield.
text: The water BLAST is relentless.
text: Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a
text: long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: What about his clothes? Might
dialog: cause problems with the other apes.
speaker_heading: DODGE

speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: You've been gone a week.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I was sick.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: Too sick to return my calls? You

dialog: was watching the news and they
dialog: started talking about a seven-year-
dialog: old chimpanzee that went nuts - and
dialog: all of a sudden, there you were on
text: the TV. A seven year old chimp,
dialog: raised since birth.
text: The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his
text: voice. Neither man cares.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He's the son of chimp 4. And he's
dialog: smart. Off-the-charts smart.
dialog: Because of the 112. The genetic
dialog: therapy was passed in utero - from

speaker_heading: JACOBS
text: Aside from biting off a man's

speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: We've had this conversation
dialog: already. We knew the 112 was
dialog: making the apes smart -
speaker_heading: WILL
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: I tried the 112 on my father.
text: A conversation stopper. Jacobs is stunned. That's the
dialog: effect Will was after.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I had a sample vial.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: You're out of your mind.
text: Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Don't you want to know if it
dialog: worked?
dialog: Jacobs can't resist...
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: Did it?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It was miraculous. Unquestionable
dialog: adult neurogenesis - development of

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It brought my father back.
text: But Jacobs is confused.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: You told me he was failing.

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: But only under one condition.
text: It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: You're giving me conditions? I

scene_heading: INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CAESAR'S CAGE - MORNING
text: Early morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar's cage.
text: He wakes shivering with cold. Notices that the other cages
text: are empty - that his cage door is open.
text: Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - MORNING
text: Caesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet
text: floor, along with the detritus of feeding time.
text: He can HEAR the APES in the distance.
text: Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He
text: pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE.
scene_heading: EXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNING
text: Caesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to
text: the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE
speaker_heading: BRIDGE:
text: THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty.
text: And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla,
text: BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT
text: THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on
text: toward the atrium.
text: The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK.
text: Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around
text: the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps,
text: orangutans with orangutans.
text: They haven't noticed him yet.
scene_heading: EXT. ATRIUM - DAY
text: Caesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take
text: notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED
scene_heading: LIKE A HUMAN.
text: HE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN
scene_heading: EYES, FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES, POSTURE
scene_heading: MORE UPRIGHT...
text: Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM.
dialog: Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
text: He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes
text: follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait.
text: Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the
text: ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then
text: tosses it to Rocket.
text: Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of
text: trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge.
text: AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET
text: SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.
text: Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches
text: out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the
text: material. Caesar jerks his arm away.
text: Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms.
text: Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can
text: make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest.
text: Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws
text: Caesar to the ground, pinning him.
text: Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket
text: across the face.
text: OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts
text: POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're
text: coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest.
text: Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on.
text: Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs
text: at his shirt, drags Caesar closer.
text: He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's
text: face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and...
scene_heading: .ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS.
text: BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter.
text: Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S
text: BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He
text: pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder.
text: Caesar starts to move off -
text: BAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF
text: CAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS.
text: BAM! DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
text: Caesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him.
text: Out cold.
scene_heading: INT. RANCH INFIRMARY - DAY
text: Caesar lies on a medical table, NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED.
text: His shirt's ripped, and he's still wearing the khaki pants,
text: now filthy and torn. TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST,
text: PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE.
text: It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment.
text: Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing,
text: restrained to a medical table.
text: Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Caesar.
text: Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Do you remember me? I'm Dr.
dialog: Stewart.

speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: Drink.
text: Caesar doesn't want the water. He signs. She clearly

speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't understand.
text: Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW
text: SOUND. She's taken aback - is he trying to speak?
speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT-D)
dialog: Can you show me? Show me what you

text: Caesar pulls at the restraints.
speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

speaker_heading: STEWART (O.S.)

speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: oh, hey Doc.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: That chimp needs protection.
text: Dodge's face falls.
speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STEWART

dialog: How intelligent?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Yeah, no, he's a real smart

speaker_heading: STEWART

speaker_heading: VIRUS TECHNICIAN
dialog: Dr. Rodman - I think there's been a

text: Will's been waiting for this observation - he's surprised it
dialog: took so long to come up.
speaker_heading: VIRUS TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I've double-checked the replication

dialog: enormously fast compared to the
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's why we're using it. We need
text: the drug quickly.
speaker_heading: VIRUS TECHNICIAN
dialog: But... isn't it risky? I mean, at
dialog: this rate of propagation, we
dialog: greatly increase the possibility of
dialog: mutations that are out of our

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I appreciate your concern - but

speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: No - thanks. I just wanted to let

dialog: Seen Caesar?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: I volunteer once a week at The

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Yeah. He had a rough start, but

speaker_heading: STEWART

speaker_heading: STEWART

scene_heading: EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - NIGHT
dialog: Nighttime.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A repulsive bowl of primate chow. Caesar - bandaged, beat-up
text: and miserable - picks at it. In the next cage, the
dialog: orangutans sleep.
text: ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. Dodge and Rodney drive up in a truck,
text: windows down, radio blaring. Dodge gets out, cigarette in
text: his mouth, and moves drunkenly to the storage shed.
text: 40 He emerges with two BEERS, throws one to Rodney.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
text: Caesar watches as Dodge offers a beer can to a chimpanzee.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Want a beer?
text: The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away.
speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here's a little taste of beer...

scene_heading: INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE -- MORNING
text: A LEVER THROWN OPEN.
text: Caesar watches as Dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages
dialog: in succession.
text: Rodney moves to the orangutan house. CAESAR PAYS CLOSE
text: ATTENTION TO THE LOCK AS IT SLIDES OPEN.
scene_heading: DODGE &amp; RODNEY
dialog: Move it! Let's go!
text: Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing
text: ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move
text: across the bridge.
text: On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE,
text: ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out,
text: then moves off to join the others.
text: Caesar maneuvers to get a better view.
text: Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him
text: push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his
text: arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS
text: HAND, PALM DOWN, OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE.
text: Rocket's the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE.
text: Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA, Buck - still
text: alone in his cage, staring through the bars, miserable.
dialog: Why doesn't the gorilla ever get to go out?
text: Then something across the ranch catches Caesar's eye: WILL'S
text: CAR'S DRIVING UP TO THE OFFICE.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
text: His heart skips a beat. He moves to the bars, barely able to
text: contain his excitement.
scene_heading: EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY
text: Will waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar
text: on a leash. He's immediately struck by Caesar's injured
text: appearance, but he plasters a smile on his face. Caesar's
text: clearly thrilled to see him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: There you are! I heard what
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
speaker_heading: (SIGNING)
text: Home now. Caesar home.
text: He tugs Will away from Dodge.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm going to get you out of here,
dialog: but not today. I'm working on it.
text: Caesar's face falls.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Soon. I promise.
text: Will notices Dodge's ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
speaker_heading: (SIGNING)
dialog: Home.
text: Still a question, a flicker of hope.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (kills him to say it)
dialog: Not yet. I can't yet.
text: Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here.
text: First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and
text: starts walking back to his cage.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait a second - Caesar, where are
dialog: you going?
text: â¢ Caesar doesn't respond, doesn't turn, just keeps walking.
text: Dodge catches up with him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: (loud enough for Will)
dialog: No place like home, huh monkey boy?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Caesar - come back here!
text: He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside
text: him. Realizes Caesar's nearly breaking into a run.
scene_heading: EXT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - DAY
text: Dodge locks Caesar in his cell. Then moves around to the...
scene_heading: EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY
text: .storage shed. He notices Will's car still parked in front
dialog: of the office... just as -
text: BAM! WILL DECKS HIM WITH A FIST TO THE FACE. Dodge hits the
text: ground. Will stands over him, too livid to realize he
dialog: might've just broken his hand.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You son of a bitch.
text: Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: That was not a smart thing to do.
text: Dodge is clearly much tougher, stronger than Will, but Will's
dialog: too angry to care.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: If I find out Caesar's been hurt,
dialog: if he's mistreated in any way, I
dialog: swear I'll have you brought up on
dialog: charges.
text: Dodge looks towards Landon's house, restrains himself.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: That wild-eyed chimp isn't yours
dialog: any more. He's mine now.
text: The truth of the statement is worse than any punch.
speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: And you're on private property.
dialog: Now get the hell out of here.

speaker_heading: STEWART (O.S.)
dialog: Morning Caesar.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY
text: The door slides open. Stewart enters, followed by Dodge.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: How's your arm? Mind if I take a
dialog: look?
text: Stewart rummages in her MEDICAL BAG. CAESAR WATCHES AS SHE
text: PULLS OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS, cuts off his bandages.
speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: Looking good...
text: Caesar makes eye contact with Dodge over Stewart's shoulder.
text: She pulls a harness from her bag.
speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm taking him out. Thought I'd
dialog: cheer him up, show him the horses.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: No way.
text: As she walks to Dodge, CAESAR GLANCES INTO HER MEDICAL BAG.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: What are you going to do? Use a
dialog: cattle prod on me?
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: If you're into that kind of thing.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: I'm safer with him than I am with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Answer's no.

speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: I can't take you.
dialog: (glancing at Dodge)
dialog: Maybe another time.
scene_heading: INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT
text: RAIN. The apes sleep. Except for Caesar.
text: Standing in the corner of his cage, Caesar pulls STEWART'S
text: SCISSORS and a roll of MEDICAL TAPE out from the STRAW.
text: He kneels at his bedding, gathering sticks and straw. Then
text: he begins weaving the tape through several sticks, binding
text: them and extending them end to end.
text: Caesar pauses, sensing something. He looks over his
text: shoulder, discovers MAURICE THE ORANGUTAN watching him.
text: They hold each others' gaze, Caesar taking his measure. Then
text: Caesar puts a finger to his lips. "Shhhh."
text: Maurice makes no movement, but the agreement is clear.

text: opens a refrigerator with a strange BIOHAZARD SYMBOL and
text: pulls out CANISTER labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
text: Evans and Will each slip on HAZMAT masks, making sure they're

scene_heading: INT. STEWART'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

text: He tries once. Misses. Twice. Misses again. Caesar keeps
text: trying... until finally the loop's in place.

text: The chimpanzees, awake now, watch to see what will happen.
text: Rocket looks from Buck to Caesar. He's beaten.
text: STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND, PALM UP, ROCKET MAKES THE
scene_heading: SUPPLICATING GESTURE. CAESAR RUNS HIS HAND - PALM DOWN -
text: OVER ROCKET'S, SEALING HIS DOMINATION.
text: A COLLECTIVE GASP OF AWE moves through the ho-use.
text: Rocket crawls back to his cage, defeated. Caesar - walking
text: at full height - follows. He CLOSES ROCKET'S CAGE DOOR AND
text: LOCKS HIM IN.
text: Then Caesar walks upright around the cages once more, making
text: eye contact with each and every chimpanzee. He exits with
text: his Lieutenant, Buck, in tow.

scene_heading: INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY
text: Will and Evans (the handler) are wearing hazmat masks as they
text: administer Adenovirus 113 to chimp after chimp.
text: Chimp after chimp convulses on the table.
text: They lead Koba to the table. Koba knows what to do. He lies
text: down, allows himself to be strapped in.
text: All routine. Everyone's guard is down.
text: But as soon as the BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST is released, KOBA
text: â¢ THRASHES OUT AN ARM, HITTING EVANS IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hold him steady!
text: Evans tightens the straps on Koba's flailing arm.
text: WE SEE THAT EVANS' MASK HAS BEEN KNOCKED ASKEW.
text: Will finishes administering the drug. Koba goes limp on the

speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay Evans?
speaker_heading: EVANS
dialog: Yeah. I'm good.
scene_heading: INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You can't put larger blocks on top
dialog: of smaller ones.
dialog: (pointing to right side)
dialog: Move the stack from here to here.
text: Koba takes the puzzle and ROTATES IT 180 DEGREES CLOCKWISE,
text: SO THAT THE LEFT STACK IS INDEED NOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
text: Will looks at Koba. Koba looks back.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (DEMONSTRATING)
dialog: You've got to take the blocks off
dialog: and stack them again, like this.
text: Will turns the puzzle back around.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's see you try.
text: Koba puts out a palm - asking for an M&amp;M.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll give you an M&amp;M if you can get
text: the blocks to the other side - but
dialog: don't do it the way you did last
dialog: time.
text: Koba thinks, then ROTATES THE PUZZLE AGAIN - THIS TIME
text: COUNTERCLOCKWISE. Ingenious in its own way.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what I want. You're just
dialog: not going to give it to me.
text: Koba puts out a palm. There's A LOOK IN HIS EYE, MALEVOLENT,
text: DISQUIETING.
text: AND SOMETHING ELSE: HIS EYES HAVE CHANGED. THEY LOOK
scene_heading: SOMEWHAT LIKE CAESAR'S - GREENER, LESS SIMIAN...
speaker_heading: WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think of Koba?
scene_heading: INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY
text: We look through cage bars at Will and Franklin, who stand far
text: away, across the room.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: You wanna know if I think the 113's
dialog: making him nuts.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I know he's smart. But there's
dialog: something else, something
dialog: worrisome. He challenges me.
dialog: Taunts me.
text: Will looks toward us, toward the bars.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: I don't want to try it on...
speaker_heading: (CATCHES HIMSELF)
dialog: .I don't want to start human

dialog: danger.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: What you're seeing has nothing to
dialog: do with the 113, Doc. The apes're
dialog: just like us - they're complex.
dialog: Some are loyal, some are selfish,
dialog: some have a good sense of humor.
dialog: And some are born rotten.
text: Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of

text: Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his

scene_heading: EXT. PADDOCK - DAY
text: Stewart sits atop one of the ranch horses, looking down at

scene_heading: INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY
text: Caesar watches Dodge BLAST Rocket with WATER. Rocket doesn't

scene_heading: INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT
text: Rocket sleeps. The FEEDER BIN OPENS AND SHUTS, waking him.
text: Tentatively, Rocket peers inside the bin: A COOKIE. Never
text: seen a cookie before. Rocket picks it up. Smells it. Takes
text: a taste. Wow. He gobbles it down.
text: At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS.
text: Caesar stands holding a LARGE BAG OF CHIPS AHOY. He tosses a
text: cookie to Rocket. Beckons him out of the cage.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - NIGHT
text: Rocket exits warily, on his guard for anything...
text: But Caesar simply stands with the cookie bag. No gorilla.
dialog: No shovel.
text: He hands the cookie bag to Rocket.
text: Rocket watches - confused - as CAESAR PULLS THE MAIN LEVER,
text: OPENING ALL THE CAGES AT ONCE.
text: CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered.
text: Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar
text: makes a motion with his hand.
text: Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest
text: chimp. Then another one. Then another.
text: The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND
scene_heading: ROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE
text: MOMENT - ROCKET'S FOUND HIS FOOTING.
text: Now Caesar opens the orangutan and gorilla cages. A moment
text: of discomfort as Caesar leads the other apes in.
text: Caesar pulls an orangutan over to Rocket. Rocket hands the
text: orangutan a cookie. The other orangutans and Buck
text: immediately line up. Discomfort's gone - now it's one big

speaker_heading: MAURICE

speaker_heading: CAESAR

speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: THERE -

scene_heading: EXT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

speaker_heading: STEWART

speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Where go?
speaker_heading: CAESAR

scene_heading: EXT. RANCH/PRIMATE HOUSES - NIGHT
text: Caesar slips out of the orangutan house, heads toward the
speaker_heading: GATE.
text: As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL
text: OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to
dialog: go with him.
text: Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER.
text: To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he
text: gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S
text: EYES HAVE CHANGED.
text: Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes
text: Rocket's face in his hands and looks into his eyes: THEY ARE
scene_heading: UNMISTAKABLY GREEN.
text: Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he
text: remembers the bite. Rocket bit him. He looks down at the
text: wound on his arm, now nearly healed.
dialog: Has Caesar's blood changed Rocket?
text: Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for
dialog: anything.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. NEAR-DESERTED TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

text: It's coming from outside.
text: REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will. He gets out of bed,
text: moves to the window, looks into the back yard.
text: THE SWING MOVES BACK AND FORTH, AS IF RECENTLY OCCUPIED.
text: Will scans the grounds - no movement, nothing to see.
text: Satisfied, he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes.
text: THAT'S WHEN A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE BED.
text: It's CAESAR'S SILHOUETTE, noiselessly emerging from the
dialog: darkness.
text: He stands there, looking down at Will and Stewart.

scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. LAB GROUNDS - NIGHT
text: Caesar and Rocket drop down to the grass. They SNIFF THE

scene_heading: INT. SECURITY KIOSK - NIGHT
text: The Security Guard yawns, checks his watch. Over his

text: chimpanzees run across the grounds.
scene_heading: EXT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Caesar and Rocket arrive at the Primate House. Caesar tries
text: the big double door - locked. He looks upward, spies a ROW

scene_heading: INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Eerie, darkly lit. SLEEPING CHIMPS stir. CAESAR and ROCKET
text: drop to the cement floor.
text: Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED

text: each one, studying the shadowy, simian faces.
text: A HAIRY ARM EXTENDS THROUGH THE BARS, PALM UP - IT HAS A RED
text: BAND AROUND ITS WRIST.
dialog: IT'S OFFERING AN M&amp;M.
text: Caesar approaches the cage... FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH
speaker_heading: KOBA.
text: HIS EYES ARE BEADY, A STEELY GREY.
text: THE TWO CHIMPANZEES SIZE EACH OTHER UP. EACH SENSES
text: SOMETHING IN THE OTHER, BUT NEITHER KNOWS WHAT IT IS.
text: Caesar moves on. HE'S INTENT, LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.
text: Rocket barrels forward, grabs the M&amp;M from Koba's hand.
text: Koba offers up ANOTHER M&amp;M. But ROCKET'S EYES ARE ON THE RED
scene_heading: IDENTIFICATION BAND - THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.
scene_heading: KOBA CAN SEE THIS. HE OFFERS IT UP - IN RETURN FOR OPENING
speaker_heading: HIS CAGE.
text: ROCKET CONSIDERS A MOMENT, THEN MOVES TO THE LATCH.

scene_heading: NO CONNECTION.

scene_heading: INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: SECURITY GUARD SEES HIM, GIVES CHASE, FUMBLES FOR HIS WALKIE-
speaker_heading: TALKIE.

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Caesar and Rocket enter. That's when WE NOTICE: CAESAR'S
text: KHAKI PANTS ARE GONE - HE'S NO LONGER DRESSED LIKE A HUMAN.
text: Caesar opens Rocket's cage. As soon as the door closes
text: behind him, the huge chimp collapses, exhausted.
text: Caesar walks around the chimpanzee house, images of the night
text: swirling through his head. Around him, the chimps sleep,
dialog: oblivious.
text: Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him.
scene_heading: INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - EARLY MORNING
text: Caesar emerges into the common area. The chimps are still

text: He hasn't seen Caesar yet.
speaker_heading: DODGE
dialog: Rise and shine, assholes.

speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell -
dialog: (seeing Cornelia's open
speaker_heading: CAGE)
dialog: You sly son of a bitch. How'd you
dialog: do that?

speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: We're gonna go slow here, alright?
dialog: You're gonna go back in your cage,
dialog: you're not going to give me no

speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Back!
text: Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips.
text: Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples,

text: the orangutan cage.
speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going to have you fixed,
dialog: Einstein, that's for damn sure...
dialog: But first we're going to figure out
dialog: how you pulled this off...
text: CAESAR INCHES BACK, KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE'S EYE ON HIM.
speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on. Get in that cage.
text: Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther.
speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I said get!
text: But Caesar doesn't move.
text: Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement
dialog: floor.
text: He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel
text: handle. Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage.
speaker_heading: DODGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get in that cage, you damn dirty
dialog: ape!
text: â¢ CAESAR'S EYES NARROW. HE STANDS TALL, STRETCHING TO HIS FULL
speaker_heading: HEIGHT.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: TREMENDOUS EFFORT... SPEAKS.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (with his voice)
dialog: No!
scene_heading: STUNNED SILENCE.

dialog: And then... they go nuts.
text: SCREAMING. YELLING. JUMPING UP AND DOWN.
text: That's when Caesar attacks.
text: He rushes Dodge, wrestling the shovel from his hands.
text: Dodge spins around to defend himself - and CAESAR HITS HIM IN
text: THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.
text: Dodge staggers back.
text: Caesar SLAMS the shovel in his stomach.
text: Dodge crumples forward.
text: CAESAR SWINGS THE SHOVEL UP, SMACKING HIM IN THE FOREHEAD.
text: Lights out.
text: Caesar drags Dodge to Rocket's cage and opens the door.
text: Rocket helps pull him inside.
text: THEN CAESAR OPENS ALL THE DOORS TO ALL THE CAGES - AND THE
text: APES COME STREAMING OUT.
text: They gather around Caesar, who holds up STEWART'S SCISSORS
text: AND SLICES OPEN HIS OWN PALM.
text: Then he walks to Rocket, who gets down on his knees and puts
text: out his hand in the supplicating gesture. CAESAR TAKES THE
text: SCISSORS AND SLICES ROCKET'S PALM, THEN PRESSES THEIR TWO
scene_heading: HANDS TOGETHER.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
text: He moves to Maurice, who offers up his hand. Caesar slices

text: and YELLS... BUT THEN OFFERS UP HIS HAND.
text: And now Caesar looks around, as EVERY APE LINES UP, THEIR

text: They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the
text: apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them.
text: BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables.
text: Another chimp falls to its death.
text: Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part
text: of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's
dialog: practically zero.
text: NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM
text: IN THE FOG.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: They're all around us!
text: Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH -
dialog: WHOOSH...
text: DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful
dialog: of some visibility.
text: That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG,
text: CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE.
text: WITH RELISH, DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE, AIMS AT CAESAR'S BACK.
text: There's glare from a ray of sunlight that's broken through
dialog: the fog.
text: He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main
dialog: cable.
text: ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE
text: AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar.
text: Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES
text: CAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL.
text: ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR
dialog: UP.
text: Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO
scene_heading: THE MAIN CABLE.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: BAM!
dialog: Rocket's hit in the back!
text: He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE
text: BRIDGE, TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH.
text: Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again.
text: But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON
text: THE BRIDGE.
text: The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD
text: THE BARRICADE.
text: Like a freight train of menacing power.
text: Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to
dialog: back up.
text: A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming.
text: And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade --
text: MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in.
text: Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable.
scene_heading: BELOW THE BRIDGE
text: Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle
text: waged above is audible.
text: He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge.
speaker_heading: AERIAL VIEW
text: As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON
text: CABLES, APES RAMPAGING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE, AND
text: APES SCAMPERING BELOW.
dialog: Vanquishing the humans.
speaker_heading: ON THE BRIDGE
text: THE GORILLAS RUN UP, OVER THE BARRICADE, CRUSHING GUNS AND
speaker_heading: CARS.
text: BUCK'S EYES ARE ON ONE THING.
speaker_heading: DODGE.
text: Terrified but refusing to run, Dodge fires, reloads, fires
dialog: Â¢
text: again, his face red with the tension of what's to come.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
text: BUCK ARRIVES AT DODGE, PUTS HIS HUGE HANDS ON DODGE'S BODY,
text: PICKS HIM UP, AND THROWS HIM OFF THE BRIDGE.
text: Dodge's body twirls through the air -
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
text: Will, Stewart and Huffs watch, dumbstruck, as DODGE'S BODY
text: HITS THE WATER.
text: Below, the victorious ape army finishes off the battle of the
text: bridge and follows Caesar through the north exit...
text: .disappearing into the dense park.
scene_heading: EXT. MUIR WOODS PARK/PARKING LOT - DUSK
text: POLICE REINFORCEMENTS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES arrive.
text: HELICOPTERS above.
text: Will's helicopter has set down. He and Stewart stand near an
text: ASSEMBLING ARMY -- an amalgamation of 'human special forces.'
text: Huffs and a small GROUP OF OFFICERS debate nearby.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: We can't gas the forest! The
dialog: slightest wind would take it over
dialog: to Tiburon.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #2
dialog: Well it'll take us months to find
dialog: them in there.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #3
dialog: Not to mention rounding them all
dialog: up.
text: Will approaches the group.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I know where they are.
text: The Officers look at him. Who the hell is this guy?
text: Huffs - embarrassed - gestures toward Will.
speaker_heading: HUFFS
text: This man owns one of the chimps.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: The so-called "leader". Says he
dialog: can reason him out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: His name is Caesar. I think he'll
dialog: listen to me. If he comes out, the
dialog: other apes will follow.
dialog: Sounds pretty far-fetched.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: You think you know where to find
dialog: this monkey?
text: Will starts to correct him - lets it go.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I do. I used to bring him here.
text: The Officers look at each other.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: We don't have a lot of options.
dialog: Let's give it a try.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But you have to promise me - if I
dialog: can get them out, you'll take them
dialog: peacefully. Tranquilize them, cage
dialog: them. No killing.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: HUFFS
dialog: Whatever it takes.
scene_heading: EXT. MUIR WOODS/EDGE OF FOREST - MOMENTS LATER
text: Will and Stewart stand at the edge of the woods. They're at
dialog: the path Caesar and Will used to take.
text: She's terrified, trying to mask it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You think this is a bad idea?
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Definitely.
dialog: He thought so.
speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: He's never going to agree to come
dialog: out with you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I know. Got to try, right? I owe
dialog: him that much.
text: Will kisses her. Heads off down the path. Then he pauses,
text: turns to look at her.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (YELLING BACK)
dialog: Think he'll forgive me?
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: (can't quite hear him)
dialog: What?
dialog: Will waves it off - never mind.
text: Stewart watches him walk down the trail... and disappear into
dialog: the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP WOODS - DUSK
text: Will walks. FLASH OF BLACK up ahead. His pulse quickens -
text: he follows it.
text: CRACKLING of BRANCHES.
text: More BLACK, swinging through the trees. Is it Caesar?
text: Will follows.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK
text: Will enters the clearing.
text: He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the
dialog: CANOPY that Caesar always loved.
scene_heading: EXT. MUIR WOODS/PARKING LOT - DUSK
text: Huffs stands looking at his watch. He looks up, turns to an
text: ASSEMBLED GROUP OF ARMED MEN.
speaker_heading: HUFFS
dialog: Follow me.
text: Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S
scene_heading: DIRECTION, GUNS READY.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Hang on a second...
dialog: (to nearest Officer)
dialog: Where are they going?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
text: Looks are exchanged. Someone grabs Stewart, who struggles
dialog: with all her might.
speaker_heading: STEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: WHERE ARE THEY GOING?!
scene_heading: EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK
text: Quiet here. Will heads toward the Grove of Trees.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Caesar! ...
text: He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN
scene_heading: FRONT OF HIM.
speaker_heading: IT'S KOBA.
text: Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his
dialog: neck.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: You.
text: Koba stands up tall. Eyes Will.
text: He takes his time - like he's enjoying every second of
text: this... He walks towards will, bares his teeth.
text: Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS, SLAMMING INTO KOBA, knocking him
dialog: away.
text: ENRAGED, KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR... BUT CAESAR JUST
text: STARES HIM DOWN.
scene_heading: KOBA - THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF, DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS.
text: Which leaves just Will and Caesar.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Humans coming.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No. I'm alone.
text: Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I owe you an apology.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Will want Caesar dead.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I thought you had killed a man.
dialog: But I should have known better.
text: Caesar's face is unreadable. Will can't tell what he's
dialog: thinking.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to know that all of this
dialog: is my fault. My responsibility.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Can you forgive me?
text: BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT. Caesar's eyes shift to the path.
text: Will realizes he's been betrayed.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (PANICKED)
dialog: Wait - no -
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Will leave.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I won't -
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Will leave now.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No. I'm staying with you.
text: Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down.
text: At that moment, HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing.
text: Huffs takes aim at Caesar.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: NO!
text: HE RUSHES CAESAR JUST AS HUFFS PULLS THE TRIGGER. THE BLAST
text: OF THE GUN SHATTERS THE FOREST'S SILENCE.
text: AT THAT SAME MOMENT APES DROP FROM THE TREES -- IT'S AN AMBUSH
text: - a COUNTERATTACK.
text: Huffs and his men are taken by surprise. SHOTS are fired,
dialog: but not fast enough.
text: UNLIKE ALPHA'S BATTLE IN THE AFRICA, IT'S A SLAUGHTER IN THE
speaker_heading: APES' FAVOR.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: AS THE APES MAUL THE MEN, CAESAR CARRIES WILL THROUGH THE
speaker_heading: CARNAGE.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DUSK
text: Caesar lays Will out on the forest floor. There's a lot of
dialog: blood.
text: Will tries to speak. He looks up at Caesar.
text: Caesar takes him in his arms, cradles him with love.
text: Will looks into Caesar's green eyes. He relaxes. Lets go.
text: Then the life passes out of him.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DUSK
text: Stewart sits in the back of a locked Police Car, looking out
text: at the forest in the gathering darkness.
text: All is quiet.
text: The forest is vast, dark, green. Impenetrable.
text: HONK OF A HORN.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Hunsiker - Will's neighbor - exits his house with a small
text: rolling suitcase. He's wearing his pilot's uniform.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - NIGHT
text: Hunsiker enters, settles into the seat.
speaker_heading: TAXI DRIVER
dialog: Where to, my man?
text: It's the Taxi Driver with the mustache - THE SAME ONE THAT
scene_heading: GAVE JACOBS A RIDE HOME.
speaker_heading: HUNSIKER
dialog: SFO. International terminal.
speaker_heading: TAXI DRIVER
dialog: You got it.
text: The Driver COUGHS as he pulls away. Light sweat on his
text: forehead - he doesn't look too good.
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON WHEELS TURNING. Hunsiker pulls his suitcase on
text: wheels through the airport terminal.
text: It's teeming with TRAVELERS. Holding on to the bannister,
text: Hunsiker takes the escalator up.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
text: Hunsiker says hello to the FLIGHT STAFF and moves to the
text: front of the plane.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
text: Hunsiker shakes hands with his CO-PILOT and sits. He flicks
text: a switch.
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT
text: The airplane takes off into the sky.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER VOICE #1 (O.S.)
text: As the ape search continues, a
text: virulent flu strain has exploded in
dialog: and around San Francisco, sending
text: shock waves and panic throughout
dialog: the community.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING - DAY
text: We move along the ground of a clearing toward a lush canopy
text: of trees. As we get closer, we notice flashes of movement.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER VOICE #2
dialog: Authorities suspect the origin of
dialog: the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys
dialog: Laboratories - the same private
dialog: company from which several
text: laboratory chimpanzees escaped
dialog: earlier this week -
text: We're still fifty yards away from the trees, but we can see
text: it's filled with apes - chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas.
text: We keep pushing in, closer and closer to the trees. As we
text: move past the leaves WE FIND BUCK. MAURICE. AND, SITTING
text: APART FROM THE OTHERS... KOBA.
text: All of them have eyes in varying shades of GREEN.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER VOICE #3
text: As the death toll rapidly rises,
text: Hospitals are desperately trying to
dialog: meet the growing demand...
text: Caesar sits alone, staring straight at us.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER VOICE #4
scene_heading: (INCREASINGLY DESPERATE)
dialog: Although isolated in the western
dialog: region of the country, the numbers
dialog: are catastrophic and quickly
dialog: rising...
text: Push in on CAESAR'S FACE.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER VOICE #5
text: Efforts to quarantine appear to
dialog: have failed. The strain has been
text: spotted as far away as Singapore
dialog: and Australia...
text: CLOSER AND CLOSER ON CAESAR'S FACE.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER VOICE #6
speaker_heading: (RAGGED)
dialog: Casualties have reached apocalyptic
dialog: levels. Authorities urge you to
dialog: stay inside your homes...
speaker_heading: (LONG BEAT)
dialog: For those of you who can hear me, I
dialog: say...
speaker_heading: (VOICE BREAKING)
dialog: God's speed and so long to you all.
text: The NEWSCASTER'S VOICE is replaced by the WHITE NOISE OF A
scene_heading: SNOWY TELEVISION SET.
text: CAESAR'S EYES FILL THE SCREEN.
