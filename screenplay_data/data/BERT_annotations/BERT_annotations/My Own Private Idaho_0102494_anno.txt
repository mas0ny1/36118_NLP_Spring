text: The desert in the daytime.
dialog: 
text: MIKE enters the frame in front of a blue sky filled with white
text: clouds. He has a Texaco gas station attendant's shirt on with a
text: name tag that reads: BILL (not Mike, his name).
dialog: 
text: The clouds are puffy against a deep blue sky. The road is red.
text: Purple mountains surround Mike on all sides far in the distance,
text: ten miles away. Mike looks in front of him at a long stretch of
text: road that disappears into the horizon.
dialog: 
text: Mike looks at his wristwatch on his arm. He times how long it
text: takes to walk ten steps down the road.
dialog: 
text: Ten seconds. He glances back at a duffel bag. The duffel bag
text: falls over.
dialog: 
text: Mike looks at the picturesque sights surrounding him. A wind
text: sends a tumbleweed into the air. He takes ten steps back to his
text: duffle bag and checks watch again.
dialog: 
text: The sun is now setting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: You can always tell where you are by
dialog: the way the road looks. Like I Just
dialog: know that I been to this place
dialog: before. I Just know that I been
dialog: stuck here like this one fuckin'
dialog: time before, you know that?
dialog: 
text: ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A JACKRABBIT IS LISTENING TO HIM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: There ain't no other road on earth
dialog: that looks like this road. I mean,
dialog: exactly like this road. (sniffs)
dialog: One of a kind. (Sniffs) Like
text: someone's face. Like a fucked up
dialog: face...
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE ROAD HAS A DEFINITE FACE. TWO DISTANT CACTUS FOR EYES - A
text: CLOUD SHADOW FOR A MOUTH, MOUNTAINS FOR HAIR.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Once you see it, even for a
dialog: second, you remember it, and you
dialog: better not forget it, you gotta
dialog: remember people and who they are,
dialog: right? Friends and enemies. You
dialog: gotta remember the road and where

dialog: 
text: MIKE SUDDENLY LUNGES AT THE LITTLE RABBIT LISTENING TO HIS CHAT
text: ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND THE RABBIT RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I Just love to scare things... I
dialog: don't know. It gives me a sense
dialog: of.... Power.
text: Mike thinks about the loneliness of the road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This is nowhere. I'll bet that
dialog: nobody is ever going to drive down
dialog: this road. I'll be stuck here
dialog: forever.
text: Mike looks at the road stressfully. The road looks back. He looks
text: at the road his eyes growing heavy. The road looks back...
dialog: 
text: Mikes yawns.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MIKE'S VOICE OVER
dialog: I don't know when it was I
dialog: recognized I had this disease.
text: Mike looks like a backwoods character who fits into the terrain.
text: Mike makes strange movements, like he is having a sort of
text: epileptic fit, then yawns like he is very tired, again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MIKE'S VOICE OVER
dialog: Sometimes I'll be in one place,
dialog: and I'll close my eyes...
text: MIKE CLOSES HIS EYES. THEN A WHOLE RITUAL OF EVENTS HAPPENS, HIS
text: EYES TURN BACK IN HIS HEAD AND HE BEGINS TO SHAKE ALL OVER. THEN
text: ALL GOES BLACK.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MIKE'S VOICE OVER
dialog: When I open them again, I'll be in
dialog: a completely different
dialog: surrounding.
text: When Mike opens his eyes, he is in downtown PORTLAND, OREGON.
dialog: 
text: A LOUD BUS drives by Mike's view in the city. He is asleep, then
text: wakes enough to see other UNKNOWN KIDS rifling his pockets in a
text: doorway, as Mike sleepily looks
dialog: on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUBTITLES
dialog: It's kind of like time travel.
dialog: It's kind of good.
dialog: 
text: MIKE CLOSES HIS EYES AGAIN, AND WHEN HE OPENS THEM HE IS BACK IN
scene_heading: THE COUNTRY. BUT THIS TIME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TERRAIN. LIKE A
text: LONG TIME HAS PASSED. HE IS ALSO WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES.
dialog: 
text: MIKE CHECKS HIS WATCH AGAIN. He looks happy at the passage of
dialog: time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah. It's kind of good. Passes
text: the time. Unwanted as it is.
text: MIKE LEANS AGAINST THE DUFFLE BAG WITH HIM. HE LOOKS INTO THE
text: FIELD next to him. The wind blows a paper cup into the air.
dialog: 
text: Mike watches the cup tumble in the air, and with a few notes, a
text: GUITAR follows. Then an uprooted cactus.
dialog: 
text: The paper cup, cactus and guitar lyrically trade places in the
text: air, and are followed by a large barn, which twists and turns,
text: then crashes directly into the middle of the road.
dialog: 
text: On the, road. Riding in the back of a pickup truck. Mike's shirt
text: ruffles wildly in the wind, traveling at 60 mph.
dialog: 
text: And the truck disappears into the sun, toward a steep mountain
dialog: range.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAS VeGAs
dialog: 
text: Mike is walking down a LONELY ALLEYWAY in the city. ALL OF A
text: SUDDEN he is surrounded by three BLACK BOYS, who are smiling and
dialog: joking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK 1
dialog: SAY, WHITE BOY, where you goin'?
dialog: 
text: Black 1 pulls out a knife and waves it at Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK 1
dialog: What's in the sack. Let's see.
dialog: 
text: Mike fights with the guy for his sack. The Black cuts Mike's
text: hands with his knife but Mike won't let go.
dialog: 
text: In terror he watches his hands get cut, but he won't let go. Mike
text: starts to yawns and does the jitters to the Black's amazement and
text: drops to the ground. Scottie, the older boy on the magazine
text: cover, comes to Mike's aid. He pushes the Black boy over, throws
text: some trash cans in their direction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK 1
dialog: This gonna be fun. Come on...
dialog: 
text: Scottie keeps fighting them off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Man, what do you want from us, we
dialog: haven't got anything.
dialog: 
text: The Blacks chuckle. Then they stop and slowly walk away from
text: Scott who hovers protectively around Mike's body on the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK (o.s.)
dialog: Faggot!
dialog: 
dialog: We are in the city of Las Vegas in the daytime. (We are aware of
text: this because one character, RAY, is reading the Las Vegas
text: Chronicle.) Mike sleeps, as a shopkeeper washes his windows and
text: three other street kids, Gary, Ray and Scottie, are hanging
text: around on the corner with him.
dialog: 
text: Gary is hitting a public wastebasket with the end of a stick as a
text: MAN in a MERCEDES BENZ drives by them very slowly, and looks at
text: each one of the boys individually. Gary pauses for a moment and
dialog: poses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (to the man in the car) What's up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN (in German)
dialog: [Entschuldiging, Junge...]
dialog: 
text: The man in the car speeds off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAR DAY.
dialog: 
text: THE MAN has the look of Rainer Fassbinder and Geraldo Rivera as
text: the same man; is of average build and has a wash of hair gracing
text: his forehead that looks quite foreign. He turns to the right
text: three times, as he is circling his car.
dialog: 
text: OUT THE WINDOW OF THE CAR, we see the boys again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What's this guy want, think he
dialog: wants to party?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: He said "Entschuldiging, Junge."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What's that mean? "Suck my dick?"
dialog: Does he want to suck my dick?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: It means, "Excuse me, boys."
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: How the fuck do you know.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I've studied German, in prep
dialog: school.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You know, Scottie, I don't know
dialog: when to believe you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
text: Here he comes again.
dialog: 
text: THE MAN leans out the window of his car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
speaker_heading: HELLO?
dialog: 
text: Gary leans into the man's car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Hey, dude.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
text: (speaks with a thick German
dialog: accent)
dialog: Excuse me. Can I speak to the young
text: man over there, with the blond hair,
dialog: ya?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Who, that kid there? You can't
text: talk with him now, he's asleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Can you wake him up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: No, you can't wake him... he......
dialog: but, what about me? Don't you want
dialog: to talk with me?
text: The man is not interested in talking to Gary. He shakes his head
dialog: no, bothered by Gary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (speaking fluent German)
dialog: Was willist du in Gottesname mit uns
dialog: Juenge? Mach' es flar oder fanre
dialog: ab!
dialog: (What in the hell do you want with
dialog: us young kids, be specific or get
dialog: out.)
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Du bisst sehr intelligent mit deinem
dialog: Aksent.. Fuer elnen Puppejunge.
dialog: (You are very clever with an accent
dialog: like that.. for a street boy.)
text: THE MAN IN THE CAR SPEEDS OFF.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Alright then, asshole!
dialog: 
text: VIEW of Mike's sleeping face.
dialog: 
text: INSIDE OF MIKE'S thoughts. He is flying over the city streets,
text: above the Mercedes Benz, effortlessly hovering and gilding above
text: it, between the buildings. Like a bird.
dialog: 
text: Mike wakes and looks at Scottie, who is talking to
dialog: Gary.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MIKE'S THOUGHTS
dialog: The first time I met Scott, I had
dialog: a feeling he was a sort of comic
dialog: book hero. He was always saying
dialog: the right thing at the right
dialog: moment, and standing up for me
dialog: when there was no reason to. Look
text: at his face now, when the sunlight
text: shines off his lower lip, like it
dialog: is the face of some sort of
text: statue. Strong and soft at the
dialog: same time. I never could figure
dialog: out what Scott was doing here with
dialog: us on the street in the first
dialog: place, like he was on some sort of
dialog: crusade, to help the poor. Because
dialog: he really did come from a rich
dialog: Portland family. I know because he
dialog: brought me to his house one day
dialog: and showed me around. I mean, wow,
dialog: they were rich I They even had a
dialog: swimming pool. Scott's the only
dialog: kid that I had ever met that had a
dialog: swimming pool. I'd make a bet with
dialog: anybody right now, that Scott is a
dialog: saint or a hero, or some such
dialog: higher placed person.
dialog: Meanwhile...
text: Gary and Ray are talking. Ray, who is a Chicano street kid, is
text: looking poetically off into the distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: My father was a gaucho. But nobody
dialog: gonna find him. He killed a guy
dialog: and split. Nobody gonna find that
dialog: fuck. I never gonna find him.
dialog: 
text: Ray spits into the gutter and the spit drifts in a small stream
text: made by the shop-owner who was washing his windows, down the
text: street and into drainage grating.
dialog: 
text: View of MIKE as he closes his eyes, oblivious to what is going on
text: around him.
dialog: 
text: The music in a DISCO blares, at night, and all we can see is
text: Mike's face, sleeping. The disco MUSIC STOPS, and the lights go
dialog: up.
dialog: 
text: A broom passes by Mike's head.
dialog: 
text: Finally, THE MANAGER'S SHOES appear at his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANAGER (o. s.)
dialog: What's wrong with him? Passed
dialog: out?
dialog: 
text: The shoes prod Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANAGER (o. s.)
dialog: Hey, wake up.
dialog: 
text: Mike wakes up in a WARD ROOM BED in the daytime.
dialog: 
text: He looks around him. The room has a lot of light, windows
text: practically on all sides of the room. There are other DETOX men
text: and women in other beds. Mike gets up and starts to walk out, but
text: he is wearing a gown.
dialog: 
text: A nurse stops him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Excuse me. Are you all right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah. I'm fine.
dialog: 
text: (Mike looks around the room.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: 
dialog: If you're going to leave us, it's
dialog: okay, but we need you to sign out,
dialog: and you'll need to get your
text: clothes from downstairs.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: Oh. Yeah. (he pauses and looks
dialog: around the place.) Do you live
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Why... no. But sometimes I feel
dialog: like I do.
dialog: 
text: The nurse walks him over to a clipboard on a desk. Mike signs the
text: board, and she gives him a receipt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What's this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: 
dialog: That's Just a receipt. if you
dialog: don't want it. You can throw it
dialog: away. That's what most people do
dialog: with it.
dialog: 
text: Then we cut to Mike's face at night. As his eyes open he takes a
text: look around him, a little dazed, trying to figure where he is. We
text: see he is under a store awning. A lot of fog is rolling across
dialog: the street.
text: A twenty-eight-year-old woman stops in a Mercedes Benz sedan,
text: similar to the one that the German man was driving. She motions
text: Mike to get inside the car.
dialog: 
text: Dazed, Mike looks at the car, then responds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: This chick is living in a new car
dialog: ad.
dialog: 
text: Inside a hallway entrance to the woman's home. Mike and the woman
dialog: take off their Jackets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This is like a dream. A pretty
dialog: woman never picks me up.
dialog: 
text: Mike begins to caress her arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: They Don't? Well. I Don't see why
dialog: not...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Is this your house?
dialog: 
text: LADY (caressing his head)
dialog: Yes...
dialog: 
text: Mike follows the woman into her...
dialog: 
text: Living room where sit Scottie and Gary on a plush sofa. Mike sees
dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Oh...
text: Mike sits down in an easy chair next to the sofa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What's up, Gary? Scottie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
speaker_heading: HEY, DUDE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: You men make yourselves
dialog: comfortable, and I'll be right
dialog: back. There're cokes in the
dialog: refrigerator - help yourself.
text: They watch her go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: She's cool. She Just likes to have
dialog: three guys, 'cause - it takes her
text: a little while to get warmed up.
dialog: It's normal. Nothing kinky.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oh.
dialog: 
text: Mike looks around the room. Gary leans closer to Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Hey, did you get into that Van
dialog: Halen concert last night?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I've never been to a concert,
dialog: dude.
dialog: 
text: Interior of the Woman's bedroom. Mike undresses. He waits by the
text: side of the bed and takes a last drag on a
text: cigarette and puts it out. Then the woman arrives. lets down her
text: negligee and approaches Mike like an EARTH MOTHER, slowly, big
text: breasted, warm, comforting.
dialog: 
text: As she approaches, Mike begins to see a familiar face. He is
text: upset when he looks into her eyes. And he begins to
text: spasmodically shake then he grows sleepy, and finally, as she is
text: upon him, he passes out.
dialog: 
text: Outside, Gary and Scottie struggle with Mike's body.
dialog: 
text: They plop Mike down on the corner, under a streetlight, fold his
text: arms under his stomach and bend him over so he is sitting up
text: against the light pole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (putting money into his pocket) He
dialog: always does this! I'm surprised he
dialog: makes money at all.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: How do we tell if he's okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Well, he's not dead.
dialog: 
text: Scott listens to his heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Listen.
dialog: 
text: Gary listens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: He's not dead. He's Just passed
dialog: out. It's a condition. It's called
dialog: narcolepsy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Scared the shit out of her. What
dialog: causes it. Sex?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Stress. Some hustler, huh?
dialog: 
text: Silence for a second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Where are we going to take him?
dialog: 
text: Scott lifts Mike's body up and carries him to a soft carpet of
text: grass on the edge of a lawn. Scott looks around to see if it is
text: okay. Then he speaks to Mike even though he is asleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Hey, little brother. You stay
dialog: here, and when you wake up, Just
dialog: come back into town. I'll be there
dialog: waiting for you. I figure you're
dialog: going to be safer here in this
dialog: comfy neighborhood than in the
dialog: city. I grew up in a neighborhood
dialog: like this. It'll be safe here.
text: Scottie hides a tear. Then he takes his Jacket off and puts it
text: over Mike, then leaves him there.
dialog: 
text: Mike's face is lying down with his nose pressed against a leafy
text: ground in the daytime.
dialog: 
text: He wakes up, stands, makes his way up a slope and out to the
text: street. He brushes himself off as the Mercedes Benz shows up
text: again. Mike recognizes it, and walks up to the window of the car.
text: It is the MAN, though, not the lady. The Man speaks with a German
text: accent - and he is about 35 years old. HIS NAME IS HANS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Say....
dialog: 
text: Hans reads Mike's shirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Say, Bill. What's happening?
dialog: 
text: Mike brushes himself off and walks down the road, thinking that
dialog: the guy is weird.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Nothing much.
dialog: 
text: Hans drives alongside Mike in his car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Do you want a lift? Bill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey, isn't this the lady's car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Is Alena a friend of yours? She's
dialog: a friend of mine. Any friend of
dialog: Alena's is a friend of mine. Do
dialog: you want to be my friend?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Not really.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANS
dialog: Get in and I'll take you
dialog: someplace. Yes? Where do you want
dialog: to go?
text: Mike doesn't respond, and walks on.
dialog: 
text: He pauses a moment, and looks at the houses in the neighborhood.
text: He looks down the street and can see Hans stopped in his car. The
text: guy gets out, and leans against the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This guy is a pervert. I can tell.
dialog: 
dialog: To Hans:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Go home!
dialog: 
text: THE HOUSES LINE THE STREET, EACH WITH A LITTLE CALIFORNIA STYLE

dialog:

dialog: Coming of the White Man.
dialog:

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: That German guy. Hans. He brought

dialog: How much do you make off me while
dialog: I'm sleeping?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Just a ride, Mike. I don't make
dialog: anything. What, you think that I
dialog: sell your body while you are
dialog: asleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: Scott sips from a coffee cup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: No, Mike. I'm on your side.
dialog: 
text: He puts down the cup. Mike knows Scottie always tells the truth.
text: Mike is a little embarrassed, that he has maybe offended Scott's
dialog: honor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I was Just kidding, dude.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Gary's up here somewhere. He left
dialog: three days ago, he flew up with
dialog: some John.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Exotic. Have you seen your dad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Are you kidding?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'd visit my dad, if he was here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I have to take care of you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How about your mom?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That lady. She looked like. My
dialog: mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Is that why you passed out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah. I mean. I don't know. She
dialog: really looked like my mother. I
text: must have been imagining things.
dialog: 
text: A pause.
dialog: 
text: The Broadway Cafe is beginning to pick up in business. The table
text: where Scott and Mike sit is in front of a large window, and it is
text: semi-circular in shape. Scottie spies Gary across the street.
dialog: 
text: He bounds up out of his chair and Mike watches him as he goes to
text: the door, kicks it open and yells to Gary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: HEY' You dick!
dialog: 
text: Gary sees Scott and runs across the street.
dialog: 
text: Later in the BROADWAY CAFE, there are other street kids hanging
text: around the table.
dialog: 
text: Scott has his arm around a girl named DENISE, who has a lot of
text: make up on and long stringy hair and who carries a teddy bear.
text: Denise is crying and Scott is consoling her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MIKE'S THOUGHTS:
dialog: It was almost as if Scott was on
dialog: some sort of crusade or mission,
dialog: when you checked him out. He
dialog: could make you feel good right at
dialog: the very time that you felt so
dialog: bad. I remember there were many
dialog: times that I had been sobbing in
dialog: Scott's arms and he was helping me
dialog: out too. He was the great
dialog: protector of us all, and the great
dialog: planner. He gave us hope in the
dialog: future. Even though there was no
dialog: future. There must have been real
dialog: trouble at home, though, for Scott
dialog: not to want to visit his father.
text: Scott strokes Denise's hair adoringly and gives her a kiss every
dialog: now and then.
dialog: 
text: Mike looks across the table at CARL, a skinny kid with black hair
text: and a large floppy sports cap, and GARY, who is talking with him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MIKE'S THOUGHTS
dialog: That's Carl. He's always around
dialog: the Broadway, he didn't run away
dialog: from home like a lot of these kids
dialog: did. He had a mom, and no dad, at
dialog: least they didn't know where he
dialog: was. And one day, he came home to
dialog: the apartment where they lived,
dialog: and there was no mom anymore
dialog: either. He didn't know where she
dialog: went. That was sir months ago.
text: MARY, an older, wiser street prostitute who is chain smoking Kool
dialog: cigarettes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MIKE'S THOUGHTS
dialog: That's Mary over there. She was a
dialog: mean old chick. She was maybe
dialog: thirty now. Old, old. Somebody
dialog: once told me that in the past,
dialog: Mary had this enemy, a chick that
dialog: had turned her in. And Mary had
dialog: gone off and kicked this chick to
text: death right in the street in front
dialog: of everybody. I don't know if it's
dialog: true, but I watched out, Just in
dialog: case. I was afraid of Mary. And
dialog: everyone else was too.
dialog: 
text: Mary takes a drag from her cigarette and blows smoke in Mike's
dialog: face.
dialog: 
text: Scott notices this. But he attends to Denise's problems.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MIKE'S THOUGHTS
dialog: (as he coughs)
dialog: This was our little round table, a
dialog: point around which everything else
dialog: revolved. It was our "center." It was
dialog: like our home. Our living room. Not
dialog: everyone was the best of friends, but
dialog: everyone knew everyone else, and we
dialog: kind of stuck together.
dialog: 
text: Mike on the street. He watches as a man carrying a large bag of
text: tin cans, crosses at a crosswalk. Mike steps up to him and begins
text: walking. His name is MARTY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey Marty. What's goin' on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Is that you Mike? Hey, what's new
dialog: with you? You look pretty good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How many you got so far today?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I reckon that I picked up about
dialog: twenty-three bucks so far with
dialog: these cans, and some I got stashed
dialog: back in the bushes. You know the
dialog: old hiding place?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wow!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Don't tell anybody, though. Just
dialog: between you and me. You need a
dialog: place to stay?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I always need a place to stay,
dialog: dude.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Yeah, well, I'm under the bridge.
dialog: You can Join me if you like.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, I think I'll rooftop it
dialog: tonight. I'm hanging with a
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Am I walking too fast for you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: No, but I'll see you around. See
dialog: you under the bridge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: 
dialog: Okay, Mike.
dialog: 
text: Mike stops walking with the guy and he splits down the street at
text: a fast clip.
dialog: 
text: Inside the BROADWAY CAFE, Mike smokes a cigarette at the round
text: table and watches Gary and Carl playing keepaway with Denise's
text: teddy bear. Denise is swearing, using profanities that are
dialog: unusual for a girl.
dialog: 
text: Night. Mike walks through a dark wet troubled inner-city alley
text: and on the other side, there is a parked car. In the car sits a
text: man in his 40's, bestial, good looking but overweight. He beeps
text: his car horn at Mike.
dialog: 
text: Mike pauses, lights a cigarette coolly and walks to the car and
text: leans in the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey - what's up?
dialog: 
text: Int. MOTEL, nighttime.
dialog: 
text: The man is naked in the background standing In front of a mirror
text: in a motel bathroom, as Mike sits naked on a bed in front of a
text: t.v. set laughing at the show that is on.
dialog: 
text: We see various still compositions of the two making love.
dialog: 
text: Afield. Day. Two figures cross the field. One is Bob Pigeon, a
text: man in his fifties, and the other, his manservant, Budd. Because
text: of his girth, Bob has problems crossing the field.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: Jesus. ..the things we've seen...
dialog: do you remember a thing since we
dialog: moved from graffiti bridge?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No more of that, Budd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: Ha-ha, what a crazy night.
dialog: 
text: Above the two walking figures, Gary wakes near a heating duct
text: atop a ten story building. He yawns, looks down at the street and
text: spies Bob and Budd.
dialog: 
text: GARY'S VIEW: a tiny Bob and Budd are making their way across a
dialog: field.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Hey, Scottie, here comes that fat
dialog: pig himself!!! He owes me money!
text: Scottie, atop an adjacent building peeks his head over the edge.
text: The two guys are relatively close to one another but far from the
dialog: street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: 
dialog: You know, the fat one... Pigeon!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: 
dialog: He stole my shoes, the dick!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: 
dialog: Hey, everybody, here comes Bob the
dialog: chiseler!
text: He yells to the other buildings and other street kids to wake up.
text: Scottie pours an old paper cup of Coca-Cola over Bob and Budd
dialog: below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Look out, it's raining Coke!
dialog: 
text: Bob hears the show atop the buildings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Ah, I think my friends can see I
dialog: am back from Boise.
text: Bob looks worried and happy at the same time, not knowing if they
text: are friend or foe. He shields himself from the Coke sprinkles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Do you see any clouds in the sky,
dialog: Budd?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: No, Bob.
dialog: 
dialog: The Derelict Hotel.
dialog: 
text: Budd and Bob enter the threshold of a busted up but operating
text: hotel. There is a fire in a trashcan turned upside down, with
text: holes poked in it.
dialog: 
text: Budd looks around the hotel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: Is Jane Lightwork alive, Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: She's alive, Budd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: Is she holding on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Old... old, Budd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: She must be old, she has no
dialog: choice...
dialog: 
text: THE TWO sit at a larger fire deeper into the derelict hotel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: I remember her daughter, she died
dialog: years ago... of old age. She must
dialog: be old, all right. That was before
dialog: I came to Clements Inn.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (warming by the fire)
dialog: Ahh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: 
dialog: Jesus... the things that we've
dialog: seen. Aren't I right, Bob? Aren't
dialog: I right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: 
dialog: We have seen the light at the end
dialog: of the tunnel...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: That we have, that we have... in
dialog: fact Bob, we have. Jesus... the
dialog: things that we've seen.
text: Scott drinks from a beer can inside the derelict hotel, tosses it
text: to a young boy, laughs, wipes his mouth and puts his lit
text: cigarette into the mouth of Gary, making his way to some steps,
text: through a circle of girls, kisses Denise, who we remember from
text: the Broadway Cafe, and charges up the steps.
dialog: 
text: Inside the hotel on a staircase landing, Scottie passes a couple
text: of figures, one is asleep and one is awake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: Where's Bob?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A BOY
text: Fast asleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
text: And he's snoring like a horse.
dialog: 
text: SCOTTIE OPENS A DOOR AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS AND WALKS INTO A
text: ROOM, INTERRUPTING MIKE, WHO STANDS OVER BOB'S SNORING BODY.
dialog: 
text: Mike coolly holds up a wad of bills and a folded envelope of
dialog: cocaine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I picked his pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: What did you get, dude?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: Just this.
dialog: 
text: Scottie takes the cocaine from him, sits down at the foot of the
text: bed and begins to unfold the packet. Bob turns in the bed and the
text: rush of air from the sheets blows the white powder out of the
dialog: packet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: 
dialog: What the hell?
dialog: 
text: Mike laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: 
dialog: What time is it, son?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: (climbing in bed with Bob)
dialog: What do you care?
text: Bob, dazed, is looking around himself, like he is being had.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: (amusing Mike)
dialog: Why, you wouldn't even look at a
dialog: clock, unless hours were lines of
text: coke, dials looked like the signs of
dialog: gay bars, or time itself was a fair
dialog: hustler in black leather... isn't
dialog: that right, dude?
text: Bob staggers out of bed retching and spitting. Then back into his
text: waking stupor, feeling something is being put over on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: There's no reason to know the
dialog: time. We are timeless.
text: Bob checks his wallet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Aren't you forgetting, Scottie my
dialog: boy, [A GOVERNOR'S SON], that we
dialog: who steal, do so at midnight?
text: Bob's money and cocaine are gone. Bob turns angry and bellows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What the...who ripped me off?
dialog: Budd!!! Budd!!!
dialog: 
text: Stairs again
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: Yes, Bob!!!
dialog: 
text: Budd stands at the stoop and comes through the door, Just as Bob
text: is running out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I fell asleep and have been
dialog: robbed!
dialog: 
dialog: Jane!!!
dialog: 
text: The room below.
dialog: 
text: Jane Lightwork, the owner of the established hotel, comes to
text: arms. She is very old.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You'd think that I could keep the
dialog: peace in my house...
dialog: 
text: Scott and Mike laugh. Mike gets down on his hands and knees and
text: tries to scoop up a little cocaine from the floor.
dialog: 
dialog: Bedroom.
dialog: 
dialog: Hall
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Bob, Bob we'll find your drugs.
dialog: We'll find them.
dialog: 
text: Another hall.
dialog: 
text: Bob is storming down it in a rage, people opening doors of the
dialog: rooms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jane, I know you well enough...
dialog: 
text: Yet another hall.
dialog: 
text: Hotel dwellers are watching Jane move down the hall answering
dialog: Bob.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know you, ~ you owe me money,
dialog: Bob, and now you pick a fight with
dialog: me, and are disturbing the peace
dialog: of my hotel.
dialog: 
text: MAIN derelict hall of the hotel.
dialog: 
text: Bob parades, in his night clothes, in front of a gathering of
text: outcasts in the hotel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: This hotel is full of thieves...
dialog: Junkies!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You are the thief!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: They picked my pocket!
dialog: 
text: LAUGHTER from the throngs of outcasts. Jane enters a balcony
text: overlook of the main hall. Mike and Scott enter, arms around each
text: other, laughing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It's impossible to board a dozen
dialog: or so men and women who live
dialog: honestly and have the others live
dialog: like Junkies.
dialog: 
text: One of the dwellers listening to the argument is shooting up as
text: they speak. We see a close view of the needle and Bob running
text: around in the background.
dialog: 
text: Bob makes his way next to Scott.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You have corrupted me, Scottie, I
dialog: was an innocent before I met you.
dialog: ..and now look at me.. just a
dialog: little better than wicked. I used
dialog: to be a virtuous man...
text: Scottie is laughing at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: '''well, virtuous enough. I swore
dialog: a little. I never gambled more
dialog: than seven times a week. Poker. I
dialog: never picked up a street boy more
dialog: than once a quarter...
text: Scottie laughs.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: ... of an hour. Bad company has
dialog: corrupted me. I'll be darned if I
dialog: haven't forgotten what the inside
text: of a church looks like.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Where do you find your strike
dialog: tonight, Bob?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: I see a good change for Bob to
dialog: make. From Stealing to Preaching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Stealing is my vocation, Scott.
dialog: It's not a sin for a man to labor
text: at his vocation.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Hey... .......
dialog: 
text: The three gather around Gary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Very early tomorrow morning, there
dialog: will be small time rock and roll
dialog: promoters coming back from their
text: show. Every night, they walk home
text: with the loot and they stop by the
text: Grotto Bar, one mile away from
dialog: here, and more often than not
dialog: they've been drinking already. If
dialog: we can't steal from them on their
dialog: way to the bar, we can get them
dialog: when they come out. See, dude?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm not gonna rob anybody. I'd
dialog: rather sell my ass. Straight and
dialog: simple. It's less risky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: So long as I don't know these guys
dialog: personally. ..it's okay with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: They're from Beaverton. New to the
dialog: business...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Not me. I'm not going along on
dialog: this crackpot scheme. Especially
dialog: since Gary thought it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Come oft it, Mikey. Find a better
dialog: way to make a buck. Something to
dialog: fall back on, other than your ass.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Scott's inheritance.
dialog: 
text: Bob walks away from the two others.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Come along, Mikey. I have a joke I
dialog: wanna play... a joke I can't pull
dialog: off alone...
dialog: 
text: Mike laughs and joins Bob, hugging him around his fat belly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, my sweetheart, come and rob
dialog: with us tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I was going to come anyway.
dialog: 
text: SCOTT hugs the others too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We'll be rich!!!
dialog: 
text: Scottie dances away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Provide for us, oh great
dialog: psychedelic Papa!
dialog: 
text: Scottie grabs Denise and kisses her then begins to leave through
text: the door. He throws her to Mike who catches her and runs off with
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Good catch dude. ..and meet me on
dialog: three street!
dialog: 
text: Scott leaves, Bob follows him:
text: 0utside the derelict hotel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Scott. When you inherit your
dialog: fortune, on your twenty-first
dialog: birthday, let's see. ..how far
dialog: away is this?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: One week away, Bob, just one more
dialog: week.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Let's not call ourselves robbers,
dialog: but Diannah's foresters. Gentlemen
text: of the shade. Minions of the Moon.
dialog: Men of good government.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: When I turn twenty-one, I don't want
dialog: any more of this life. My mother and
dialog: father will be surprised at the
dialog: incredible change. It will impress
dialog: them more when such a fuck up like
dialog: me turns good than if I had been a
dialog: good son all along. All the past
dialog: years I will think of as one big
dialog: vacation. At least it wasn't as
dialog: boring as schoolwork. All my bad
dialog: behavior I'm going to throw away to
dialog: pay my debt. I will change when
dialog: everybody expects it the least.
text: Scott turns and leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: And you will become a hard roller,
dialog: a hatchet man for your old man.
dialog: 
text: Scott laughs to himself, because he knows Bob is misunderstanding
text: him. Bob is part of the past life that he says he is going to
dialog: throw away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: No! You will be the hatchet man,
dialog: Bob, that will be your job, and so
dialog: there will rarely be a job
dialog: hatcheted. It will be one big
dialog: endless party, won't it?
dialog: 
text: Bob laughs. Scott walks across a field.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, at least my little friend
dialog: has offered me a job. They are so
dialog: good to me.
dialog: 
text: Inside the Broadway Cafe. Day.
dialog: 
text: Denise and Mike hang out together. Both are smoking cigarettes
text: which have made a billow of smoke that hangs over the table that
text: is in the front window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Moms are great, because, you know,
dialog: I could always go to my mom and
dialog: say, hey I need a new lipstick,
dialog: and she would always give me money
dialog: for that. That was great.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I only saw my mom once, but I
dialog: remember what she looked like. She
dialog: was very beautiful.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: What do you mean, once?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: When I was born.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: How could you remember when that
dialog: god-awful thing happened?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Dunno. But I remember it. how
dialog: beautiful and kind she good. Yeah,
dialog: I remember was. She was good
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: And she split from you, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Maybe she didn't mean to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Did you see what was going on,
dialog: Mike? Between Pinky and Dale? Did
dialog: you see that? That's the third
dialog: fight I've seen today. Things
dialog: always happen in threes.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't know. They have a sort of,
dialog: ah, relationship. Between them.
dialog: 
text: Across the street there are three people, a TALL MAN, who has his
text: hat stuck on his boot and a lady and another man with a dog on a
dialog: leash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't know about that, but, ah,
dialog: listen, what you and me talk
dialog: about, it's just between us, you
dialog: understand? Hey, what's over
dialog: there, see those assholes? Who are
dialog: they, you know any of them?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: I can't see that far
dialog: 
text: DENISE STANDS AND OPENS THE FRONT DOOR AND YELLS ACROSS THE
speaker_heading: STREET.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
speaker_heading: HEY!
dialog: 
text: The group across the street look up and begin yelling back, but
dialog: we cannot hear them.
dialog: 
text: Under the Burnside Bridge, day.
dialog: 
text: Mike and Denise kiss, and their arms are entangled in a loving,
text: but awkward embrace. Twigs and leaves are caught in Denise's hair
text: as they are lying on the ground.
dialog: 
text: Different STILL COMPOSITIONS OF SEX while they are lying in the
text: wilds under the bridge.
dialog: 
dialog: Then...
dialog: 
text: Denise lights a cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: That reminds me, I gotta send my
dialog: Ma a Christmas card, I still
dialog: haven't done it yet.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, I haven't done it either.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Your mom lives in Idaho right now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: I used to live in Montana.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: My own cousin. He's dead. that's
dialog: one...two... And my grandma, it
dialog: usually comes in threes.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Does come in threes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: My cousin died, my grandmother
dialog: died, and right after she died,
dialog: her daughter died. My aunt. Within
dialog: a year. And they wuz all women,
dialog: not even a year, six...well....
dialog: six months-eight months, three
dialog: women in the family died.
dialog: 
text: A pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's funny, huh? I WONDER WHY
dialog: YOU THOUGHT THAT, cuz, my FATHER
dialog: says stuff like that.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Well, my grandma was
dialog: superstitious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: My father told me that, said
dialog: things usually come in threes...
dialog: and I said, .... you're crazy.
dialog: 
text: A Long pause. A motorcycle passes, someone yells, and a horn
text: honks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It sounds crazy. That's my lucky
dialog: number too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Three.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Mine's eight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I like three.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: You know why I like eight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Cause of the eight ball. You know.
dialog: When you're stuck behind the eight
dialog: ball? I fuckin' feel stuck behind
dialog: the eight ball today, I'll tell
dialog: you. The business is so slow in the
dialog: middle of the week, you know that
dialog: Mike?
dialog: 
text: Public bathroom. Night.
dialog: 
text: Mike empties the contents of his pockets at a bathroom sink. He
text: has in his possession: One condom. One comb with blond hair stuck
text: in it. One nickel. Half a stick of gum. One knife with the letter
text: W stamped on it.
dialog: 
text: He arranges these things in a neat order on the surface of the
text: sink while a man flushes a toilet in the background and uses
text: another sink. Mike is quite at home here. He takes his time
text: arranging the articles, and washing his hands. He looks over at
text: the man washing his hands and gives him a friendly smile.
dialog: 
text: The man leaves. Mike puts all the things on the sink into his
text: pockets. Then he walks over to a urinal, unzips his fly and
text: starts to take a leak. A shadow opens the door in back of him,
text: and without turning around, Mike senses the presence of a man.
dialog: Alleyway. Night.
dialog: 
text: Scottie is helping Bob with a disguise, putting on pants over a
text: large belly, with medallions around the neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: How long has it been, Bob, since
dialog: you could see your own feet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: About four years, Scottie. Four
text: years of grief. It blows a man up
text: like a balloon.
text: Mike and Budd appear, running, with costumes on. There are two
text: others behind them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: There's rock and roll money
dialog: walking this way!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: And they're drunk as skunks.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This is going to be easy. We can
dialog: do it lying down.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: But don't fall asleep, now, Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: Shh! Here they come!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: You four should head them off
dialog: there!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We four? How many are walking with
dialog: them?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: About six.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Huh, shouldn't they be robbing us?
dialog: 
text: Scottie laughs. Bob waddles along the side of the alleyway,
text: stepping on a curb, then in a pothole losing his balance. Another
text: accomplice whistles from atop a building. We SEE the group of
text: ROCK AND ROLL promoters.
dialog: 
text: Bob walks further from Mike and Scottie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: If they escape from you, we'll get
dialog: them here.
dialog: 
text: Bob struggles as he walks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Eight feet of cobblestones is like
text: 30 yards of flat road with me.
text: Mike and Scott run off, laughing at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I can't see a damned thing in
dialog: here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: Jesus, will you shut up! And keep
dialog: on your toes!
text: Budd sees the promoters coming and waves to Bob as he lies down
text: on the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: Lie down!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Lie down!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: Lie down and stay quiet, until
dialog: they round the corner and we'll
dialog: ambush them.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Have you got a crane to lift me up
dialog: again?
dialog: 
text: Budd laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They're coming!!
dialog: 
text: Down the way, the rock and roll promoters are approaching, having
text: no knowledge of the buffoonery at the other end of the tunneling
text: alleyway. They are drunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICTIM 1
dialog: Come along neighbor, Tommy will
dialog: lead the way. I've lost track of
dialog: time... (burp)
dialog: 
text: At the other end of the alley:
dialog: 
text: Bob and three others are marching in procession, chanting, a
text: facsimile of Rashneesh, but a bad act.
dialog: 
text: The rock promoters approach, smashing a bottle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICTIM 1
dialog: Who are these jokers?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICTIM 2
dialog: Rashneesh, listen!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICTIM 1
text: They're chanting....
dialog: 
text: Scottie and Mike hide behind garbage cans, laughing.
dialog: 
text: The rock promoters circle the group of chanting Rashneesh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICTIM 3
dialog: I thought that all you Rashneesh
dialog: had up and left...
dialog: 
text: Victim 1 pours a beer on one of their heads. Just as he does this
text: Bob pulls out two long pistols, almost heavy enough that he
text: cannot hold them straight, barrels parallel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Aha! One move and I'll blow you
dialog: away, you sully scumbags, up
dialog: against that wall!
dialog: 
text: One of the victims falls down and begins to run away. One of
text: Bob's men starts after him. A lockbox that he was carrying falls
text: to the ground. Bob spies it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No! Let him go!
dialog: 
text: Bob aims one pistol at the running figure as he keeps the others
text: against the wall with the other pistol. He fires three times. One
text: of Bob's boys grabs the lockbox.
dialog: 
text: A VIEW of the running figure, bullets cutting around him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Look at him go!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICTIM 2
dialog: Don't shoot us!
dialog: 
text: Bob winks at the lockbox and shoots the gun in the air.
dialog: 
text: All the rock promoters go running. Bob charges after them, firing
text: the gun twice more in the air, then once at the lockbox, breaking
text: it open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The valise is open. Let's see what
dialog: we got.
dialog: 
text: Mike and Scottie hiding behind trashcans.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: Where are our disguises?
text: Mike runs to his stash and finds two large capes and large hats.
dialog: They put these on.
dialog: 
text: Bob finds wads of money and receipts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Ticket anyone? To next week's
dialog: show?
dialog: 
text: He throws these on the ground and the boys fall over themselves
text: for the tickets. Bob wads the money and puts it back in the box,
text: laughing to himself.
dialog: 
text: Mike and Scottie sneak closer to the group still hiding, long
text: flowing capes concealing their identity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
text: Scott and Mike have disappeared,
dialog: did the shots scare them away?
dialog: 
text: They sneak closer. Mike lights a big firecracker and waits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: ...maybe we should get the hell
dialog: out of here. But, are they such
dialog: chickens?
dialog: 
text: A LOUD EXPLOSION!
dialog: 
text: Mike and Scottie, disguised, jump out with large silver baseball
text: bats, swinging them and making as much noise as they can,
text: knocking over a set of garbage cans, flashing flashlights into
text: Bob and the others' eyes.
dialog: 
text: Frightened, Bob drops the lockbox and runs, the others follow,
text: Mike and Scottie hitting them with the bats as they go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Get the box! Oh, Fuck!
dialog: 
text: Mike swings the bat at Bob, it grazes the side of a building and
text: sparks fly from it. Bob wheezes from the run.
dialog: 
text: Scottie chases the others in the same direction.
dialog: 
text: They stand, kicking garbage cans and watching them run,
text: convulsing with laughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: The thieves scatter!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Bob Pigeon will sweat to death!
dialog: 
text: Jack Favor enters the Governor's CHAMBERS day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Can anyone tell me about my son?
dialog: 
text: He walks across the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's been a full three months
dialog: since I last saw him. Where is my
dialog: son Scott?
speaker_heading: AID
dialog: We don't know, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ask around in Old Town, in some of
dialog: the taverns there. Some say he
dialog: frequently is seen down there
text: drinking with street denizens.
dialog: Some who they say even rob our
dialog: citizens and store owners. I can't
dialog: believe that such an effeminate
dialog: boy supports such 'friends.'
dialog: 
text: A high overhead (helicopter?) view of the country landscape in
text: the early morning. Far below us on a lonely road is a small dot,
text: a motorcycle, traveling east.
dialog: 
text: Further along on its travels, the motorcycle crosses a steel
speaker_heading: BRIDGE.
dialog: 
dialog: Old Town day.
text: Scottie and Mike, riding on a stolen motorcycle, sweep through
text: the early morning streets without being noticed.
dialog: 
text: Stopping at a stop light in the city.
dialog: 
text: Scott pauses to think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Mikey, do you realize how long I
dialog: have been here out on the streets,
dialog: on this crusade?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: About as long as the rest of us. I
dialog: mean. I can't even remember that
dialog: far back, Scott, I mean
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: It's been three years, Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wow... that's a really long time,
dialog: Scott. Have I been here three
dialog: years, too?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: What I'm getting at, Mike, is that
dialog: we are survivors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, well, so, isn't that
dialog: obvious?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Yes. It is incredibly obvious.
dialog: They could drop a bomb on this
dialog: city and you know what we would
dialog: do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (thinking)
speaker_heading: DIE?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: No. We would survive. Because we
dialog: are...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Survivors!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Right, Mike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Say, Scott. Whaddya say we go
dialog: survive over at the Broadway Cafe
dialog: a little bit, at least it's warm
dialog: over there.
dialog: 
dialog: Int. Broadway Cafe. Day.
dialog: 
text: Mike and Scott sit around the table with Carl and Mary. Mike
text: blows a smoke ring.
dialog: 
text: Denise runs in the door of the cafe, excited about something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: MIKE! Scottie! There's a man from
text: City Hall down the street. He
dialog: wants to speak with you, Scottie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: He says that he's sent by your
dialog: father.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Say hello and send him to my
dialog: mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What kind of a man is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: A young man. And he's got cops
dialog: with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Cops....
dialog: 
dialog: Street exterior day.
dialog: 
text: Two POLICEMEN and one OFFICIAL are walking down the street toward
dialog: the Broadway cafe.
dialog: 
dialog: Broadway Cafe interior day.
dialog: 
text: The cops enter, passing The PROPRIETOR of the cafe, an aging
text: heavyset woman named NANCY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Good morning, officers...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: How are you this morning, NANCY?
dialog: Don't mind if we take a look
dialog: around your place, do you?
text: One officer is already inspecting the stolen motorcycle outside.
dialog: 
text: Mike sees this, and looks the other way from the cop who is
text: peering in the Broadway cafe window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Have you seen the young Scott
dialog: Favor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I do believe he was here just a
text: second ago. Nancy looks in the
text: front window.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Oh, yeah, there he is.
dialog: 
text: Nancy points Scott out.
dialog: 
text: Scott is giving Denise a long kiss, hiding from the cops. The
text: OFFICIAL walks to the front window of the Cafe. Scott pretends
text: he is being rudely interrupted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Ah-ha... what have we here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Excuse me... Mr. Favor... we have
dialog: been sent in search of a fat
dialog: man... a large bearded....
speaker_heading: COP 1
speaker_heading: FAT MAN...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 2
text: Goes by Bob Pigeon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Bob Pigeon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: That's right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: What do you want with him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: Ahem. There's been a report, sir,
dialog: he has been involved in a
dialog: holdup...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Last night. Have you seen him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I saw him around last night, when
dialog: was the holdup?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 1
text: Late. Two in the morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I saw him about four, but he
text: wasn't very loose with his wallet.
dialog: Did he get away with any of the
dialog: money?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: Yes, indeed, sir... two thousand
dialog: dollars of a rock promoter's
dialog: money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Well, anyway, I haven't seen him
dialog: recently. Why do you look here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: 
dialog: They say he has friends here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: 
dialog: I beg your pardon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: Sorry...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Sorry for the interruption. We
dialog: have a message for you from your
dialog: father. He says that he would like
dialog: to see you as soon as possible.
dialog: 
text: THE OFFICIAL HANDS SCOTT AN ENVELOPE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: 
dialog: Thank you for your message.
dialog: 
text: Scott takes the envelope and puts it on the table.
dialog: 
dialog: street, day.
dialog: 
text: The police close the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: 
dialog: Hmmm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 2
dialog: What about the dead body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Let's not get Favor's kid involved
dialog: in this report if we can help it.
dialog: But if he were my son, I'd....
text: Cop 1 makes a fist and slams It In the palm of his other hand.
dialog: 
text: INT. Broadway Cafe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Bob is a wanted man now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: And as dangerous to be around as
dialog: cops themselves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We need a hiding place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: Where should we go?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: To visit my brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: You have a brother?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yes, I have one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Where is he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He's in he's in
dialog: 
text: Mike suddenly begins to shake, and, falls asleep.
dialog: 
text: Scottie picks up the envelope from his father and puts it in his
dialog: pocket.
dialog: 
text: Mike and Scott are stuck on a long straight road in the desert.
text: Mike is angry at Scott because he doesn't think he knows how the
dialog: motorcycle works.
dialog: 
text: Scott is trying again and again to start the engine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Come on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Shut up, Mike.
dialog: 
text: He tries to turn it over again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: If I had known that it was going
dialog: to be this hard to start, then I
dialog: wouldn't have stopped it at all.
text: Mike looks at the road and the surrounding area. It is the same
text: road that he was stuck on in the beginning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Scott? I just know that I have
dialog: been on this road before.
dialog: 
text: Mike stares at the face in the road. Two cactus for eyes,
text: mountains for hair, a cloud shadow forms the mouth over a red
text: nose road with a dotted line running down it.
dialog: 
text: At night, Scott and Mike sit next to a fire they have made on the
text: side of the road. We can hear Indians in the distance dancing
text: and chanting a song.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It sure is lonely out in the
dialog: desert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Yeah, I guess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: If I had had a normal family, and
dialog: a good upbringing, then I would
dialog: have been a well adjusted person.
dialog: But somehow that just didn't work
dialog: out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Depends on what you'd call
dialog: "normal. -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Well, normal, you know, with a mom
dialog: and a dad and a dog and shit like
dialog: that... normal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: So you didn't have a dog? Or you
dialog: didn't have a dad...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I didn't have a dog and I didn't
dialog: have a dad. Well, not a normal
dialog: dad...
dialog: 
text: The music is getting louder. It sounds like a war chant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey Scott?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Mike is hesitating. He is about to say something personal. He
text: looks at Scott and back to the fire, a few times too many.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: What, Mike?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oh. Have you ever. Uh...
dialog: 
text: Scott is getting Mike's drift. Mike rubs his crotch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I mean, don't you ever get horny?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Yeah. But...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oh, yeah... not for a guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Mike. Two guys can't love each
dialog: other. They can only be friends.
dialog: 
text: An awkward moment passes where Mike is looking away from Scott
text: and Scott can't help but look at Mike. Then Scott catches Mike's
text: eye and motions for him to come closer to him.
dialog: 
text: Mike walks over to Scott and Scott holds him in his arms.
dialog: 
text: Overhead VIEW of the two in front of the campfire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I only have sex for money.
dialog: 
text: Mike starts to get out some money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I can't take your money.
dialog: 
text: A pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: But we can be close friends.
dialog: 
text: The next morning. Mike is sleeping. As he opens his eyes, he can
text: see Scott still trying to start the motorcycle.
dialog: 
text: Mike stands and looks down the road at an approaching State
text: Police Car. Mike, afraid of the police, starts to move into the
dialog: bushes.
dialog: 
text: Scott is out of breath trying to start the bike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Scott, look...
dialog: 
text: Scott looks in the direction of the police car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Looks like this is it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: Scott hits the side of the gas tank of the bike with the palm of
text: his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Can't get the bike started. Cops
text: are coming. Stuck in the middle of
dialog: nowhere with a stolen bike. Yeah,
text: Mike. Looks like this is the end.
dialog: 
text: The policeman pulls up to them and parks.
dialog: 
text: The policeman sits in his car for a second and reports into the
text: radio, then he gets out and walks over to the boys.
dialog: 
text: Mike gets scared and runs into the desert.
dialog: 
text: The cop stands and watches. Mike has nowhere to go, he is running
text: into an open desert.
dialog: 
text: The policeman, a full blooded American Indian, seems amused at
text: his power. He looks at Scott then back at Mike, who trips in the
text: desert and falls in a cloud of dust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: What's the matter with him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I don't know. I guess he doesn't
dialog: like cops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: That's how it looks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: What are you kids doing out here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: This cycle is one bitch to turn
dialog: over. But you probably don't know
dialog: about motorcycles. You aren't a
dialog: motorcycle cop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: I turned a few.
dialog: 
text: Scott walks through the desert looking for Mike where he dropped.
text: He picks him up out of the dirt, spit dripping from his sleeping
text: lips, and smacks him in the face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Wake up, Mikey, the heat's off.
dialog: 
dialog: Mike will not wake up.
dialog: 
text: When Mike wakes up. He is inside a TRAILER at night.
dialog: 
text: Scott is eating sandwiches to his right that are on a little TV.
dialog: tray.
dialog: 
text: There is MIKE'S BROTHER leaning into him on his left. He looks at
text: Mike offensively. His brother is very good looking, but looks
text: like he has lost his mind somewhere down the line. Which is why
text: he lives in the desert in a trailer, away from people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Look, Mike. Sandwiches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: Your mother... now she was a right
dialog: woman. She used to be so proud of
dialog: you... you know... she would just
dialog: beam. And not Jim Beam either. If
dialog: you know what I mean. We used to
dialog: drive for hours to get a look at
dialog: you. I remember, what was it...
dialog: eighteen years ago?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Twenty-one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: Is that how old you are now? I
dialog: thought you wuz younger than
dialog: that... what? Well anyway, we
dialog: would start off in the morning to
dialog: see you, and it would take an hour
dialog: to get to the institution. You
dialog: were maybe one year old. What? I
dialog: wasn't proud that you had to live
dialog: in an institution, mind you... but
dialog: all the same, when I would look at
dialog: you, all the institutional walls
dialog: would come down and we were a
dialog: family. Your mom, me, and you. God
dialog: knows where dad was.
dialog: 
text: Mike is getting visibly upset. Scott gets up to go to the
dialog: bathroom.
dialog: 
text: Inside the bathroom night.
dialog: 
text: Scott enters and notices a velvet portrait of a woman hanging on
text: the wall. Off screen Scott can hear Mike and his Brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE (o.s.)
dialog: I don't belong to you, DUDE... I'm
dialog: not yours...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER (o.s.)
text: (his voice booms out so
text: unexpectedly deep and loud that
dialog: Scott is startled) Shut your
dialog: mouth! Don't you talk back...
dialog: 
text: His brother hits the table with a crash.
dialog: 
dialog: Living room night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: Well... (takes a breath )
dialog: Anyway. You were maybe not in the
dialog: biological sense, my brother, but in
dialog: our business, ~..... (holds his
dialog: hands up in the air) And If I'm not
dialog: Your brother, how's come you turned
dialog: out exactly like me then?
dialog: 
text: Mike has gotten the jitters and fallen asleep in front of him.
dialog: 
text: Scott enters from the bathroom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: Oh, he'll come out or it. It's
dialog: like this whenever we get together
dialog: It's always like this when we get
dialog: together It's the way that we say
dialog: hello to each other.
dialog: 
text: He holds his head down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: I'm all that he's got. But he
dialog: doesn't want me. He doesn't care.
dialog: He'd rather live out on the
dialog: streets. I love him, though.
dialog: 
text: Scott looks around the trailer at all the velvet portraits
text: hanging on the walls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: Oh. I paint these for a living.
dialog: But sometimes the people don't
dialog: send the check when they get
dialog: finished. So I keep them. I like
dialog: them.
dialog: 
dialog: Ext. Trailer. Night.
dialog: 
text: Mike and his brother sip iced tea. Colored lights decorate the
dialog: trailer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: Want me to tell you what happened
dialog: to your Mom? Have you ever heard
dialog: it? Did you ever hear what the
dialog: hell happened to her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No. But I don't care.
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: You loved her, and don't tell know
dialog: you did. me you didn't. I
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I didn't even know her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: Yeah, you loved her, though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I already heard what happened to
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: But you don't know the whole
dialog: story. One thing about the truth.
dialog: It's interesting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't care.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: If you had known her, you would
dialog: care. She would see guys on the
dialog: side. At night. When I wouldn't be
dialog: around... maybe I'd be in San
dialog: Francisco or some darned place,
dialog: doing my own business. God knows
dialog: where. She would see guys...
dialog: yeah.... anyway along comes this
dialog: guy. A guy we both knew. A guy who
text: was into cards. A gamblin' man.
dialog: And he said that he used to herd
dialog: cattle in Argentina. I dunno,
dialog: maybe he did, and he had a bit of
dialog: money. More'n I had at that point
dialog: in time. But it was funny, the way
dialog: he gambled. He was not safe in the
dialog: friends that he made. So his money
dialog: would come and go real fast....
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I never heard this one before.
dialog:

dialog: for a year or so and your mom
dialog: wanted to marry this guy. She was
dialog: already married to our real dad.
dialog: So he said no. He didn't love her
dialog: anyways. But she wanted him to
dialog: marry her. And to have a little
dialog: family. That's when you were born.
dialog: As a matter of fact, you were
dialog: really the cause of this whole

dialog: family and take you and this guy
text: someplace and set something up.
dialog: 
text: (slaps his leg with his hand)
dialog: 
dialog: A family thing! Ridiculous, right. A

dialog: What? I mean What? I used to

dialog: 
text: Mike begins to cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BROTHER
dialog: And she used to do other things
dialog: with this gun. Sexy things with

dialog: brought her to the movies one
text: night. A drive-in movie in a

dialog: 
text: Bob, with Bad George in tow, straightens himself up as the yuppie

dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Come, George, watch this. You will
dialog: see the attention that I get.
dialog: 
text: Bob looks at his clothes. A bouncer spots them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's true we're drawing attention

dialog: 
text: Scottie turns and meets Bob, who kneels next to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: Please leave me alone.

text: Bob is thinking that Scottie's attitude is a joke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOTTIE
dialog: Don't think that I'm the same

dialog: Everyone has noticed that I have
dialog: turned away from that life, and

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Pigeon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A BOY
text: Scottie Favor broke his heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: He's gone now, either to Heaven or
dialog: to Hell.
dialog: 
scene_heading: JANE LIGHTWORK
dialog: Be sure it isn't to Hell. He tried
dialog: to be an honest sort. I'm the one
dialog: who heard him cry out last night.
dialog: He said God, God, God... three or
dialog: four times. And when I got there I
dialog: put my hand into the bed and felt
text: his feet. And they were cold as
dialog: stone. And I checked the rest of
dialog: his body. And it too was as cold
dialog: as stone.
speaker_heading: BUDD
dialog: (crying)
dialog: It sure is quiet.
dialog: 
text: Mike approaches Budd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I guess you're gonna miss him the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Here. Maybe you can give him a

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Mike exits.
dialog: 
text: In the country, Mike looks at the road.
dialog: 
text: He has visions of sagebrush and rock flying into the air as if
text: picked up by a big wind.
dialog: 
text: Then he lies asleep by the side of the road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE'S VOICE
dialog: I suppose that a lot of kids like
dialog: me think that they have no home,
dialog: that home is a place where you
dialog: have a mom and a dad.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MIKE'S THOUGHTS
dialog: But home can be any place that you
dialog: want. Or wherever you can find
dialog: My home is right here on the side
dialog: of this road, that I been to
dialog: before. I just know I been on this
dialog: fucking road one time before, you

text: Later, a car drives by Mike's sleeping body by the side of the

text: in his car and drives off down the road.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MIKE'S THOUGHTS
dialog: Sometimes I had thought that God
dialog: had not smiled on me, and had
dialog: given me a bum deal. And other
