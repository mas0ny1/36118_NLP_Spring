scene_heading: EXT. THE ISLAND OF MANHATTAN/OPENING TITLES — DAY
text: Fly over the East River... until the privileged cement
text: canyons of the Upper East Side roll by... now the green of
dialog: Central Park... to the Las Vegas of Times Square... and the
dialog: charm of Chelsea...
text: As the grid gives way to the thin doglegs of the West
text: Village... over the stark lofts of Tribeca... to Libeskin's
text: work in progress, Phoenix readying to rise...
text: Around the thumbnail of the Financial District... to the
dialog: immigrant-cum-hipster miasma of the Lower East Side... over
text: the multicolored fire escapes of The East Village...
dialog: And land on...
speaker_heading: UNION SQUARE
text: amongst the activity, the cars, the throngs of people...
dialog: find...
speaker_heading: THOMAS WEBB
text: Early-twenties... a blank canvas of a boy with perfect teeth.
text: Dirty-washed jeans and the famous Lennon New York T.
text: Thomas stands still in the middle of Union Square with the
text: people around him rushing from one tiny piece of their life
text: to the next. He's collecting himself. Stealing a moment.
text: As Thomas descends into the subway.
scene_heading: INT. UNION SQUARE STATION — DAY
text: The uptown 4,5,6 platform. Waiting for his train, Thomas
text: looks down the track. A man in a WOOL HAT turns to him.
speaker_heading: WOOL HAT
dialog: It's coming.
text: Thomas breaks his gaze... regards the man.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WOOL HAT
dialog: Know how I knew?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: WOOL HAT
dialog: The train. How I knew it was
dialog: coming. Would you like to know?
text: Thomas shrugs. A dramatic beat, then...
speaker_heading: WOOL HAT (CONT'D)
dialog: Mice.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Mice?
dialog: In proud confirmation...
speaker_heading: WOOL HAT
dialog: Mice.
scene_heading: INT. THE UPTOWN NO.5 SUBWAY — DAY
text: Thomas leans against the pole. He's lost in the reverie of
text: his moving reflection until something catches his eye.
speaker_heading: A SUBWAY AD
text: for an exhibit at the met. It shows a statue...
text: RODIN'S "HAND OF GOD"
text: A large white marble hand that rises up from the earth.
text: The hand holds a man and a woman in its grasp.
text: As Thomas holds on the ad...
scene_heading: INT. THE REGGIE SANDERS GALLERY — DAY
text: A small art gallery in the East Village.
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: She's into him. But he's not into
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MIMI PASTORI
text: wears a double dyed pink wife-beater that stops just short of
text: her bumper sticker... the Chinese symbol of balance. She
text: owns a temple of a body built of feminine mesa-morph and
text: displays small diamond stud in her nose.
text: All of Mimi's attempts to hide her beauty fail miserably.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: As Mimi points up toward the painting she's looking at.
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: Her love for him is so transparent
dialog: it's embarrassing.
text: Thomas stands at her side. They admire the painting.
text: We now see that they are looking at a Calderesque abstract
text: painting featuring only a black circle and a purple triangle
text: at opposite ends. Mimi's pointing to the triangle.
speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)
dialog: And look at how indifferent he is
dialog: about it. It's obvious he's not
text: going to turn.
dialog: And Mimi always wears this thing that makes her incredibly
dialog: sexy... it's called an education.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: They never turn.
text: As she pulls away.
speaker_heading: MIMI
text: Yes, it's sad. She's all alone.
dialog: There are no more shapes in the
dialog: painting.
text: They fall into a slow gallery pace.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Will you come with me?
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: No, Thomas, I wouldn't go to
dialog: another one of your mother's dinner
dialog: parties for all the money in that
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You don't care about money.
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: But I care about my sanity.
text: They walk in silence. Admiring the art work.
speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)
dialog: Just don't go if it bothers you
dialog: that much.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I have to. My mother isn't stable.
dialog: Throwing dinner parties is how she
dialog: medicates.
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: What about the Lithium and Xanax
dialog: not to mention the nicotine and
dialog: Shiraz?
text: Thomas thinks about it for a beat, then...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Semantics.
scene_heading: EXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK — DAY
text: They walk through the park. It's a brilliant fall day.
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: Thomas, I have to tell you
dialog: something. I might be going to
dialog: Zagreb.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: It's the largest city in Croatia.
dialog: Helmut Graph is running a workshop
dialog: and I can transfer the credits back
dialog: to NYU.
text: Thomas puts on a plastic smile. Tries to be happy for her...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: That's...
text: And immediately fails...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: terrible.
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: Why? Why is that terrible?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Because you're the only thing in my
dialog: life I'm settled on. How long is
dialog: the program?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: Mimi stops
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: Six months. Look, I don't even
dialog: know if Helmut will have me, he's
dialog: fucking brilliant. He doesn't
dialog: accept just anybody.
text: , faces him.
speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)
dialog: Thomas, just what do you think is
dialog: happening here? You and I? What
dialog: do you think this is?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I think... I... August eighth. I
dialog: think August eighth was real.
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: It was amazing, Thomas, but it was
dialog: just one night. We were both on
dialog: ecstasy, I thought I was a pirate
dialog: and I was vulnerable because Nick
dialog: left... and it was just one night
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Well, I'm crazy about you.
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: And I'm crazy about you. But--
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Don't say "as a friend."
text: He pulled the words right out of her mouth...
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: Why not, Thomas? Why is that so
dialog: bad?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Because pretty girls like to
dialog: recruit their rejections and call
dialog: them friends.
text: Mimi considers arguing but defers to sigh in defeat.
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: Yeah, I'm pretty sure ugly girls do
dialog: it too.
text: Mimi puts on a mock frown. Then...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)
dialog: You know one of the first concepts
dialog: children learn, Thomas? Justice...
dialog: fairness. They comprehend it at
dialog: like two. Their favorite refrain;
dialog: "Not fair!"
text: As she pierces into him with her blue eyes.
speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)
dialog: It's funny -- we learn justice so
dialog: young but it takes us a lifetime to
dialog: comprehend injustice.
text: And she kisses him on the forehead.
speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)
dialog: We don't turn, Sweetie.
scene_heading: INT. 99 ORCHARD STREET — NIGHT
text: Thomas heads into the Lower East Side tenement, grabs his
text: mail and stops to sift through it
text: A man in his fifties stands in the small foyer with him.
text: This man just stands there... regarding Thomas all the while.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Anything worth opening?
text: Thomas looks with a smile.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Just bills and junk.
text: Thomas returns to his mail but the man doesn't stop staring
text: at him. He's disheveled but not vagrant... more of a
text: cerebrally artistic unkemptness -- an unmade bed of a man.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'm W.F. Gerald. I just moved into
dialog: three C.
text: Thomas extends his hand.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Thomas Webb.
text: W.F. shakes it.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Why so troubled, Thomas?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Excuse me.
text: W.F. looks Thomas up and down. Studies him.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: I know that color of stress
dialog: actually. It's much brighter than
dialog: job issues yet much more subdued
dialog: than possible disease.
dialog: (stops and smiles)
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm being rude.
text: Thomas laughs. Humors the man.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: No, I had a bad day. If you can
dialog: guess it... be my guest.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Women problems.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Bingo.
text: Thomas sets to go, but...
dialog: W.F.
dialog: What's her name?
text: Thomas stops, turns and answers...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Mimi.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Ahh Mimi. Derived from Williamina.
dialog: It means "the resolute protector."
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: There you go.
text: As Thomas smiles, heads for the stairs...
dialog: W.F.
dialog: And what is it you like about this
dialog: Mimi?
text: and stops again. Turns once more.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Are you a psychiatrist?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
dialog: W.F.
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You ask psychiatrist questions.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Maybe I can help. Maybe I can help
dialog: you get Mimi to sleep with you.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: How do you know she hasn't already?
dialog: W.F.
dialog: C'mon, Thomas. It's obvious.
text: With that... Thomas heads for the stairs.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: It was nice meeting you.
text: As Thomas bounds the stairs, W.F. calls out after him.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: What is it you like about Mimi,
dialog: Thomas? Let me help a new neighbor
dialog: out.
scene_heading: INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT — NIGHT
text: Lower East Side typical. Thomas lays on his mattress and
text: stares at the ceiling. Frustrated. Eyes wide open.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: (to the ceiling)
dialog: How is it so obvious?
scene_heading: EXT. 99 ORCHARD STREET/HALLWAY — NIGHT
text: Thomas knocks on 3C. W.F. answers the door.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
text: The way she bites her lip when
dialog: she's nervous. The way her
dialog: incredibly witty remarks have the
dialog: ability to be optimistic and
text: cynical at the same time. The way
dialog: she looks at me when I say
dialog: something stupid and the way she
dialog: looks at me when I don't. Do you
dialog: want me to keep going?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: W.F.
dialog: No, I get it.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Then let me ask you something...
dialog: how can I?
scene_heading: INT. W.F.'S APARTMENT — NIGHT
text: The place is empty. Completely void of furniture.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Where'd you meet her?
text: Thomas and W.F. sit on the floor drinking wine.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: There's this rare book store called
dialog: "The Pale Fire." It's named after--
dialog: W.F.
text: John Shade's 999 line poem.
text: Thomas confirms, impressed.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Well there are some rare vintage
dialog: books in there. I'm into that...
text: reading off the beaten path. Mimi
dialog: works there and she gave me the
dialog: greatest recommendations. She's
dialog: putting herself through NYU's
text: Literature program. She reads a
dialog: book a week.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Sounds like a smart girl.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: And beautiful. She's incredibly
dialog: beautiful in this really
dialog: unexplainable way -- like she's
dialog: direct from God... not second
dialog: generation if that makes sense.
text: W.F. slowly smiles.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Complete sense.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: We got each other... there was good
dialog: cadence. Thing was she had a
dialog: boyfriend named Nick. He's in
dialog: "Fahrenheit 185" which is this
dialog: kinda hot band named after--
dialog: W.F.
dialog: The exact temperature it takes to
dialog: cook heroin properly.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Right. So Nick goes on tour.
dialog: Mimi's now available, we're hanging
dialog: out more... we have this magical
dialog: night together on August eighth...
text: And Thomas sighs in wistful defeat.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
text: Then it all goes platonic.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: How old is Mimi, Thomas?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Twenty-two. She just turned twenty-
dialog: two.
text: W.F. thinks about it for a moment, then leans forward...
text: Thomas listens as if it's God telling him the situation.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Mimi's young, Thomas. She's at an
dialog: age where defense mechanisms are
dialog: very strong. Despite her outer
dialog: veneer, she's ruled by fear. You
dialog: just need to make her afraid of
dialog: something more than being with you.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Which is?
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Not being with you.
text: Thomas sips his wine, mulls it over.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: How am I supposed to do that?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Let life take over. Find a window.
text: Then... pounce.
text: Thomas considers it, thinks it through....
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: That's your sage neighborly advice?
dialog: I want my money back.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Oh, you're not giving life enough
dialog: credit, Thomas. The unpredictable
dialog: forces of humanity.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: My life is not unpredictable. It's
dialog: conventional. And it's boring.
text: W.F. stands and stretches. Says in a tired sigh...
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Life is as much of a dream as it is
dialog: a nightmare, as random as it is
dialog: deliberate, as funny as it is
dialog: tragic... and yours is no
dialog: exception, Thomas.
dialog: Thomas considers W.F.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: W.F.
dialog: I told you -- I'm W.F. Gerald.
text: As Thomas simply regards this strange man.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE BROWNSTONE — NIGHT
text: Looks like an old castle. Recently renovated, the expansive
text: four story brownstone sits across from Riverside Park as it
text: hugs the corner of 83rd street.
scene_heading: INT. THE WEBB BROWNSTONE — NIGHT
text: A dinner party in full swing. Thomas sits at the table with
text: around ten other NEW YORKERS, all well heeled.
text: A heated argument is taking place between GEORGE, an

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Tammany Hall worked.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Worked at lining pockets.
dialog: Note Thomas' mother, JUDITH WEBB, early 50's, intellectually
text: attractive, as opposed to the reconstructed uptown statues
text: she's friends with. But Judith's always nervous, seems on
text: the verge of a breakdown... precisely because she is.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And you're going to claim Robert
dialog: Moses was clean?
dialog: Note Thomas! father, NATHAN WEBB, 50's. Has that indefinable
dialog: aura of success to him. Very good looking. When a woman
text: claims she's into older men... she's referring to Nathan.
text: BARBARA, an art dealer chimes in.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Did anybody read Jeffrey Tobin's
dialog: article about how New York should
dialog: secede from the rest of the
dialog: country?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (back at David)
dialog: Robert Moses wanted to turn this
dialog: city into Los Angeles.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It was very clever. Calvin Klein
dialog: would design the flag... Giuliani
dialog: would be on the money.
text: ANNA, a top magazine editor and a Brit, picks it up...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I read an brilliant book on the
dialog: history of great Mayors.
text: Nathan speaks up and the table immediately listens.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Speaking of books, Anna, we just
dialog: commissioned Neil Strauss to do a
dialog: bio on Jenna Jameson.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Jameson? The pharmacy heiress?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No, she's a porn star, Barb.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And people really care about that?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: That's all they care about. Our
dialog: mandate is simple at Kenta; bios of
dialog: any haircut under forty as long as
dialog: they're still with-in their fifteen
dialog: minutes... self help, political
text: rants and weight loss.
text: With a British sigh...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Fiction is dead. It's quite sad.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: It's not sad, Anna. It's
dialog: economics.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm sorry, Nathan, but I disagree.
dialog: Don't you think you're dummying
dialog: down America?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: America was dummied down years ago.
dialog: The job's finished, George. Turn
dialog: on a TV, go to Times Square, have a
dialog: conversation with a fifteen year
dialog: old. Fiction may be dead but
dialog: commerce is not.
text: Anna tisks.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: And once a writer... so cynical,
dialog: Nathan Webb.
text: Nathan shrugs it off. Judith grabs her husband's hand.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: I know, Anna. I want him to sell
dialog: the company. Launch some sort of
dialog: Magazine that could give exposure
dialog: to these gifted young writers out
dialog: there. He says he doesn't want to
dialog: sell false hope.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Nathan kisses Judith.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Her idealism. That's why I married
dialog: her.
text: Thomas sheepishly smiles. Admiring his parents' love.
speaker_heading: NATHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's simple... if I had continued
dialog: with my writing career, we'd all be
dialog: having this conversation in a two
dialog: bedroom in Queens and none of you
dialog: would be here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But Nathan, you're a much better
dialog: publisher than you ever were a
dialog: writer.
text: Nathan shrugs off David's remark then looks over to his son.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Look, if Thomas were to come to me
dialog: with the desire to become a writer
dialog: I’d talk him out of it.
text: Now the table is looking at Thomas.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: How is the restaurant business
dialog: Thomas?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I don't work for Union Square
dialog: Hospitality anymore.
text: Nathan announces to the table while glaring at Thomas.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: He lives on the Lower East Side
text: without any direction. The only
dialog: thing missing is a marijuana habit.
dialog: Seems like a joke, but both Thomas and Nathan know... that
dialog: was Dad serving a dig. So Thomas returns...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: But I'm working on that.
text: They all laugh. Except for Nathan...
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN — NIGHT
text: Thomas leans against the granite island. Judith smokes a
dialog: cigarette. She'd be doing the dishes but she has HELP... so

speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: Our Warhols may not be Warhols.
dialog: Well, they're Warhols, rest
dialog: assured, but this damn
dialog: authentication committee has been
dialog: screwing everyone over to raise the
dialog: prices of their own pieces.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: They'll be authenticated, Mom.
dialog: Don't worry.
text: She's perpetually frantic, seamlessly shuffling from one
text: topic to another. It's how she fits into her skin.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: Don't pay any attention to your
dialog: father. He thinks if he can
dialog: embarrass you in front of our

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: It's fine, Mom.
text: Judith takes her son's hand.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: You take your time, you weren't

dialog: is too hard on you. It's not like
dialog: he didn't take his time.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Mom, it's fine.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: He didn't build the publishing
dialog: house up until after years of
dialog: poverty and failure -- he was going
dialog: to be the next Salinger.
text: She takes a long, reflective, benzodiazapine-enduced moment
text: then... looks up... almost crying...

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JUDITH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MIMI

speaker_heading: THOMAS

text: She's deep in thought. Working hard to help him.
speaker_heading: MIMI

speaker_heading: MIMI

speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)
dialog: Everybody is saying that Croatia is
dialog: the new Prague but it's better than
dialog: that... it's more like the old
dialog: Paris.
text: Thomas simply regards her as she bites her lip. Her every

text: himself back. As he does...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
text: This man moved in across the hall
dialog: from me. I don't know what he does

speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: Um-hm
speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: MIMI

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: No. What's my father doing here?
text: As Nathan Webb walks in.
text: Thomas stands up to greet his father but stops on the dime.
text: On the woman Nathan walks in with.
text: Thomas watches Nathan lead the woman to a table. This woman

dialog: almost professionally. Intense beauty... devastating beauty.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)

speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: She's a model.
speaker_heading: THOMAS

text: Mimi and Thomas are dancing.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I couldn't have handled this

speaker_heading: MIMI

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Then it's a good thing my father
dialog: isn't here.
text: She sadly looks into his eyes. A long moment. Is she about

speaker_heading: MIMI
text: The groom is coming.

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Not a bad showing.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: It's amazing, Howard.

speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for coming.
text: Howard immediately looks around. This transparent look-

speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: Congratulations.

speaker_heading: HOWARD

speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)

dialog: Actually he might not be a

speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Howard, how does it feel to be

speaker_heading: HOWARD

scene_heading: INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM — NIGHT

speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: I need a cigarette.
text: Irwin tells a story to the table and they're laughing.
text: Laughing, Johanna looks over and catches Thomas staring, she

speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)
dialog: Thomas...
text: He's lost in the lock of Johanna's gaze.
speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)
dialog: Thomas...

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: I'm going to have a cigarette.
text: Thomas blankly nods. Looking at Johanna all the while.
scene_heading: INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM — SAME
text: The band plays a slow number. Thomas looks on at the couples

speaker_heading: JOHANNA (0.S.)

speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

dialog: It's not your business and I don't

dialog: nonetheless -- Irwin's a good
dialog: friend. Where's your girlfriend?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
text: Outside having a cigarette and
dialog: she's not my girlfriend... just a
dialog: good friend.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Oh, you shouldn't let her do that
dialog: to you.
text: Thomas looks ahead. Says nothing, until...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: He's thirty years older than you
dialog: and he's a billionaire. I'm not
dialog: stupid.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: You are stupid, Thomas. And you
dialog: don't understand how the world
dialog: works.
dialog: (and then)
dialog: And he's not a billionaire anymore
dialog: because Nancy got half of
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: It doesn't really matter
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: No, it doesn't.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You look nice.
text: He turns to her.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: In a tux. You look very nice.
dialog: You're not conventionally good
dialog: looking like your father but you

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: And I don't really think you're

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Irwin's probably looking for you.
dialog: I'm sure he paid for the whole
dialog: night.
text: Johanna grabs him by the arm, hard.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Come here!
text: She pulls him off to the side... away from everyone.
text: Right in front of a statue.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: First of all... hooker comments?
dialog: Have you really resorted to hooker
dialog: comments?
text: Thomas looks down to his feet.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Second of all, Irwin divorced Nancy
dialog: because he's gay. He loves men.
dialog: In fact he loves one man in
dialog: particular. A man named Billy
dialog: Arnaldi who happens to be an
dialog: incredible interior decorator and
dialog: one of my closest friends.
text: She's furious. Keeps going.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, Irwin doesn't want to come out
dialog: and that's his prerogative so I
dialog: come to events like this with him.
dialog: I'm not a glorified hooker, he's
dialog: not my sugar daddy -- I'm a beard.
text: Thomas looks up to see the statue facing him is...
text: RODIN'S "HAND OF GOD"
text: The real deal. In the marble. In all its glory.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHANNA

dialog: Okay? We live in shades of gray --
dialog: not black and white. Not

dialog: everything you read is true --
dialog: there is no fuckin' Santa Claus!
text: Thomas is silent. Embarrassed. Then...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: For real?
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: For real.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: He's gay?
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Belle & Sebastian.
text: And Thomas simply stares at Rodin's masterpiece.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: And you weren't looking out for
dialog: your father -- you were jealous.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I wasn't jealous.
text: Thomas can't look at her. His eyes pasted on the statue.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: It's okay, Thomas.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I don't feel well. TI drank too
dialog: much.
text: She walks behind him, faces the statue as well. Like they're
text: at the same exhibit... in deep in appreciation of the same
dialog: piece but don't know each other.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: You don't have to be jealous.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Trying... to...
text: And she lightly kisses the back of his neck. A baby kiss.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: . make love to me, Thomas.
text: Thomas' gaze is pasted onto the statue. That giant white
text: marbled hand jutting out from the Earth and holding those two
text: naked people. Protecting them? Or about to squeeze?
text: She repeats her last line. Only now it's its own sentence.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Make love to me, Thomas.
speaker_heading: AND THOMAS WEBB
text: Staring straight ahead. Close on... wide eyed. A handful of
text: shock mixed with a pinch of fear. As he fights down a
text: swallow. Says nothing. Closer still... a bead of sweat
text: rolls down the side of his face.
text: Hold on his deer-in-the-headlight expression, then pull back
dialog: to be in...
speaker_heading: JOHANNA'S LOFT
text: Spacious. And impeccably decorated. Thomas stands still
dialog: with that same expression.
text: Johanna lays down two glasses of red wine on the table, sits
text: on the couch.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Won't you join me?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: This is wrong.
text: She slowly moves from the couch to him.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: There is no right or wrong.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: There is only is. This is a good
dialog: is, Thomas.
text: She kisses his neck.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: There's this story about a monk who
dialog: wanted to know what pure truth was.
dialog: So he climbed this really big
dialog: mountain and found the head grand
dialog: pooh-bah monk who lived there.
text: Takes his hand, slowly glides it from her face to her neck.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, nobody had made it this far
dialog: before, Thomas, so this was a big
dialog: deal. And he asked the head monk
dialog: what was pure truth. And do you
dialog: know what the head monk said?
text: He has to swallow to fight out the simple word...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: "So it has come to this."
text: As she glides his hand down the neckline of her dress.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: No judgment. No right or wrong.
dialog: Pure truth...
text: Johanna places Thomas' hand onto her breast as he looks her
text: tightly in the eyes.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: So it has come to this...
text: Then suddenly... he RIPS her dress open, throws her back
text: against the couch. She lets out a surprised moan as he takes
text: her by the back of neck.
text: And he kisses her.
dialog: Hard... wet... not clean...
text: And he ravages her.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: AND THOMAS WEBB
text: naked, on top, sweating, thrusting forward, out of breath,
dialog: another thrust...
dialog: All the cruel cock teases, all the sexless friendzones, all

scene_heading: INT. JOHANNA'S LOFT/BEDROOM — MORNING

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I have to go.

speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Why do you have to go?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I have to go to a career counselor.
dialog: My father set up the appointment.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Why don't you just go into
dialog: journalism? You ran the High
dialog: School newspaper.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: It doesn't interest me anymore.
dialog: How'd you know that?
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Go into advertising... you won that
dialog: award in college.
speaker_heading: THOMAS

dialog: very impressive. Trust me, a girl

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Here's something you don't know.
dialog: Here's something nobody knows.
dialog: I wanted to write.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Really.
text: She takes his head onto her chest. Traces his hair line.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I wrote these stupid stories in
dialog: High school, they weren't really
dialog: stories, they were more like
dialog: letters.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Letters?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: But not to people. To concepts.
dialog: Like; "Dear Death; I know I can't
dialog: avoid you but I don't want to fear
dialog: you."
text: As her fingers trace his eyebrows.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: You would personify abstractions
dialog: then write letters to them.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Yes. But I tried to make the
dialog: substance of the letters universal,
dialog: you know... what we all feel.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: That's cool.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: I think so. Very Mitch Albom, Jack
dialog: Canfield, point of purchase.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Sophomore year I cleaned them up
dialog: and showed them to my father.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: And what did Nathan say?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Serviceable.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Ouch.
text: Thomas stares at the ceiling. Her fingers trace his ears,
text: his chin, his mouth...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: That was the exact word. "Nothing
dialog: special," he said. "Serviceable."
dialog: He seemed very angry after reading
dialog: them. You have to understand, he's
dialog: very bitter he never made it as a
dialog: writer.
text: She leans over and kisses him.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Well, I love the idea. I'd like to
dialog: read them right away.
text: He doesn't kiss back. Just vacantly stares at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I threw them out.
text: She lays back down. Stares at the same ceiling.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: That's so sad. That's so...

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Love is hard to determine, Thomas.

speaker_heading: W.F. (CONT'D)
dialog: But I've found a sure way to know.
speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: W.F. (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, there was a woman I knew.

speaker_heading: W.F. (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: That seems so drastic.
dialog: W.F.
dialog: I was younger then. Not much older

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: MIMI

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: MIMI

speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: Why Thomas? Do you not want me to

speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MIMI
dialog: Is she prettier than me?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Yes.

speaker_heading: MIMI

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: AND JOHANNA

text: She lies her head down on Thomas' chest.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You lied to me.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: I did?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Irwin Rosenthal isn't gay.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I asked a few old friends.

speaker_heading: JOHANNA

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Because you don't care about
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You obviously don't care about
dialog: anything at all. My mother. Me.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: You're saying I'm a nihilist.
speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: JOHANNA

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: JOHANNA

speaker_heading: THOMAS

text: And this resonates with her. Makes her angry.
text: As she gets up... covers herself with the sheet.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: W.F. (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: W.F. (CONT'D)
dialog: It happened by accident actually.
dialog: You know the fountain in Washington

text: Thomas does. W.F. remembers fondly...
speaker_heading: W.F. (CONT'D)
dialog: It was a very clear night with the

dialog: it was basically ours. And I asked
dialog: her to dance.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: To dance?
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Yes. There was no music but we
dialog: danced there. And it came to me.

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: NATHAN

text: Nathan stands. Circles the table.
speaker_heading: NATHAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: But why me?
dialog: W.F.
dialog: Because your story interests me.

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Mimi and Thomas step out of the elevator into the swinging

dialog: superficial book deals.
dialog: Everybody's drunk. Everybody's table-hoping. Everybody's

speaker_heading: MIMI

speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)
dialog: How long have you wanted me?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Since the moment you recommended

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You have to excuse me.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN — NIGHT

speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry.

speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Is something funny?
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Yes. You, Thomas. Your clichéd
dialog: world. Your black and white

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You weren't abused.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: No, Thomas. But I've been

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: JOHANNA

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: JOHANNA

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I'll tell him about us. I'll tell

speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: I don't think you have the balls

scene_heading: INT. THE RAINBOW ROOM — NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. 5TH AVENUE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MIMI (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Shopenhauer was right, Mimi.

speaker_heading: MIMI

speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK — NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM — MORNING

speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I don't know if that--

speaker_heading: JUDITH

scene_heading: INT. NATHAN'S OFFICE — DAY
text: Thomas stands with the Guard. Nobody is in the office.
text: Thomas walks over to the desk. He looks at the pictures on

text: And he looks over to a corkboard wall where there are

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD

text: THOMAS WINNING A TENNIS MATCH IN HIGH SCHOOL
text: A long shot of him throwing his racket up in the air after

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What did she say?
text: Nathan sighs and has a seat.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: She told me you saw us. And that

text: Thomas laughs.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You're not angry at me? You're not

dialog: say?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: That you're hurt. That you're
dialog: worried about your mother.
text: And Thomas looks over to the kitchen where Johanna stands.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Hello, Thomas.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Did she tell you we slept together?
dialog: Did she tell you that she seduced

speaker_heading: JOHANNA
dialog: Can I offer you a Poland Springs
dialog: Thomas?
text: Thomas just looks at her. She shrugs.
speaker_heading: JOHANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's cold.
text: He regards her a moment then looks back to his father.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Why not? Why can't it be true?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I don't think she'd do that to me
dialog: and I know you wouldn't.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Well, we did. Six times.
text: Nathan looks to Johanna who grimaces as if Thomas is so
text: delusional that she actually feels sorry for him.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: C'mon, Thomas. Let it go. Look
dialog: it can't be true because...

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: THOMAS

scene_heading: INT. W.F.'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: W.F. (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course this artist... the one

dialog: Of course he agrees.
dialog: (and then)
text: He and the girl walk the city for

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: And that's where he realizes he

dialog: Yes, Thomas, you've figured it all

speaker_heading: W.F. (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: W.F. (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: She was going to marry me all the

speaker_heading: NATHAN
