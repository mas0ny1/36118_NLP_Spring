dialog: they’re there or not is unclear.)

scene_heading: EXT. HARGA FARMSTEAD - CONTINUOUS 31
text: It is a vast H&lsingegard (a farm). About a HUNDRED PEOPLE
text: stand on the grass, waiting. They are dressed like farmers
text: from a Swedish fairy tale. They appear to be a WELCOMING
text: COMMITTEE. The melody, we now see, is being played by three
text: floutists. A bundle of SPEAKERS (aimed upwards) amplifies
dialog: this.
text: At the center of the farm is one particularly LARGE building
text: in the shape of a barn; this is the MAIN HOUSE. Surrounding
text: this are several houses, a horse stable, a temple, and
text: different gardens. The windows and doorways are all adorned
text: in ST. JOHN’S WORT (flowers with bright yellow petals and
text: golden stamens). Beyond the farmstead are fields of CROPS.
text: Most of the arriving crowd is embraced ecstatically by the
text: welcoming committee. They hug and kiss and squeal with
text: excitement. It appears to be something of a REUNION. Pelle,
text: in particular, is bombarded with affection. (Many of the

speaker_heading: SIV
dialog: And now, in keeping with tradition:

text: 2) The girl in a large field, walking backwards as she

text: Inside of it: the girl and the boy (with spiraling eyes) are

text: gesturing to a MURAL that dramatizes the following:
speaker_heading: PELLE
dialog: We think of life like the seasons.
dialog: You are a child until 18, and
dialog: that’s the Spring. At some point
dialog: we all do our Pilgrimage, and
dialog: that’s between 18 and 36. That is
dialog: Summer. Then, from 36 to 54,
dialog: you're of working age, which is
dialog: Fall. And finally from 54 to 72,
dialog: you become a mentor.
text: Josh and Christian have written all this down - their eyes
text: intermittently piercing each other. (Josh finishes with “53-
scene_heading: 72 -- Mentor -- WINTER”. )
speaker_heading: DANI
dialog: What happens when you turn 72,
dialog: then?
text: Pelle makes a comical THROAT SLASH gesture. Dani laughs, and
text: begins to walk off.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN MARK
dialog: Not a lot of privacy. What do
dialog: you do when you need to jerk
dialog: off? Or give yourself an enema.
text: Now that Dani is away, Pelle crosses quietly to Christian. He
text: covertly ushers him aside.
text: Dani has found a wall of many FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS. They all
text: feature a different young woman dressed in ceremonial garb.
text: In each photo, the woman is richly adorned in summer flowers
text: and wears an impressive FLORAL CROWN. These photos have been
dialog: taken annually for the last dozen years.
text: Dani looks over to notice Pelle still talking to Christian,
text: who now has one hand behind his back. He looks extremely
text: GUILTY. She interrupts by bluntly asking:
speaker_heading: DANI
dialog: Are these the May Queens?
speaker_heading: PELLE

text: Christian, hand behind his back, now sneaks over to Dani.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Hey. Can I just pull you...?
text: Christian ushers her gently out of the front door. They
text: move to the Front Steps. Beyond them, four women (all
text: different ages) are gathered closely as they SING SOFTLY
text: ("heydihrudi...") to a crying baby. Struck by this, Dani
text: watches this for a second. As she does so, Christian
text: produces a SOCKERKAKA (sponge cake) from behind his back. A
text: candle protrudes.
speaker_heading: DANI
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Happy birthday.

text: Dani, noticing this, looks inquiringly to Pelle.
speaker_heading: PELLE
dialog: The iron keeps away the “invisibles.”

text: We continue panning past this to find a large GROUP that has

text: see them in a medium wide, gently pulling back). They stand
text: in rows of ten. At the head of the class is YLVA, one of the
text: elders who carried the torch around the house. In
text: demonstration, she lifts her arm and waves it fluidly,
text: rhythmically, EMOTIONALLY, back and forth. (This is
text: accompanied by a Hargan, OSKAR, who sings a wordless emotion-
text: based song - not dissimilar to speaking in tongues. The dance
text: is inspired by this song.) The class IMITATES the dancer.
text: They strive to perfectly match her movements and emotions.
text: (Josh watches raptly in the BG.)
text: Finally, we’ve pulled back far enough to reveal Dani’s
text: shoulder in the FG. She’s watching the dance class, having
text: just woken up. She then turns to look around, marvelling at
text: the structure of the community around her. She SITS DOWN
text: cross-legged, being mindful to soak it in.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMSTEAD - ONE HOUR LATER 43
text: The dining tables have been set up to form a RUNE

speaker_heading: MARK

text: Our group stands to the side, along with Simon, Connie and

speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Are you sure you can handle this?
text: Dani doesn’t know the answer to this.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe you should go back to the
dialog: main house? It’s not too late.
text: Dani starts to wrestle with this, but then:
speaker_heading: DANI
dialog: No. I need to try.
text: A HORN sounds. All eyes go to...
text: SIV holds _a WOOD-BOUND BOOK whose cover is marked by runic
text: letters. She opens it and reads in silence for a moment. Its
text: scripture is written in runes and unknown hieroglyphs (the
speaker_heading: AFFECT language).
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (to Pelle, whispering)
dialog: What’s that book?
text: Christian leans in to hear the whispered answer:
speaker_heading: PELLE
dialog: Rubi Radr. Our scripture.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Can I read that?
speaker_heading: PELLE
dialog: You would not be able.
text: CU of Rubi Radr's pages, as held open by Siv. They are indeed
text: indecipherable to common eyes.
text: Siv, eyes on the page, surprises our group by beginning to
text: SING a wordless hymn. It’s beautiful, yet feels improvised,
text: as if inspired (on the spot) by emotions provoked by the
dialog: text.
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF - SAME TIME 46
text: The two elders have been carried to the top of a CLIFF

scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - SAME TIME 45A
text: Everyone looks up at the cliff’s peak. Dani is SWEATING BEADS
text: now, her breathing erratic.
text: Finally, YLVA appear at the edge.
dialog: Rapt silence.
text: Ylva stands there for a long time.
text: Mesmerized, Josh steps slowly to the side (away from Dani and
text: Christian) to get a better look. His eyes are glued to the
text: cliff-top.
text: Ylva, having now summoned total confidence, assumes a GRAND
text: POSE, twisting her arms and legs into a standing fetal
text: position, and extending her neck/head into a glorious reach
text: for the heavens. This pose represents a final statement.
text: Dani BRACES herself. Her TEETH begin to chatter. She GRABS
dialog: Christian’s arm, and then --
text: Ylva LEAPS OFF THE PRECIPICE. Connie and Simon SCREAM. The
text: woman plummets 200 feet to LAND FATALLY on the jagged rocks
text: below. Upon impact, a FLOCK OF BIRDS ALIGHTS from a tree.
text: Connie SCREAMS.
text: Our group is shocked into horrified silence. Dani looks like
text: she’s been knocked out of her body. The birds fly over Dani’s
text: head, and a sudden rush courses through her.
text: Disassociated, Dani turns to look at Connie and Simon, who
dialog: are freaking out.
text: Then Christian points upward, redirecting Dani’s dazed
text: attention to the cliff-top. Dani’s EYES scan back up to
dialog: see...
text: DAN - the elder whose torch burnt out before circling the
text: house three times - is_now stepping up to the precipice. He
text: also strikes a POSE, also reaching for the awesome, but his
text: is slightly clumsier. He wobbles, but he holds the pose.
text: While holding it, he turns to look down...at Dani.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (panicking)
dialog: What’s happening? Is he gonna jump,
dialog: too? No--
text: Dan LAUNCHES HIMSELF OFF THE CLIFF, jumping vertically.
text: Connie GASPS. Dan plummets straight down, but his left foot
text: lands on the large rock that killed Ylva. This obliterates
text: his leg and. sends him falling brutally to his side. Dan,
text: unfortunately not dead, WAILS in horrible pain.
text: The community grumbles with concern. Everyone turns to
dialog: THREE MEN - each the oldest of their respective generations

dialog: understand what they must do.

text: Dani watches, overwhelmed, as the three men (now armed with
text: the cudgel) stalk over to Dan. The dying man moans
text: pathetically, in too much pain to scream.
text: From DANI’S POV: The men have arrived at Dan’s feet. The
text: mentor RAISES the cudgel, and brutally swings it down onto
text: Dan's HEAD. This isn’t a fatal blow. The man raises the
text: cudgel again, and this time he STRIKES Dan with enough
dialog: force to silence him.
text: The mentor hands the cudgel to the LABORER. He raises the
text: cudgel and brings it down onto the old man’s crown. The
text: elder’s leg goes into pathetic SPASMS. Blood gurgling. The
text: qaborer BLUDGEONS him once more. Dan goes limp, probably
dialog: lead.
text: The YOUTH is now handed the cudgel. He delivers two brutal
text: swings to Dan’s head. The mentor gently takes the cudgel away
text: from the youth, and they all return to the community. The
text: mentor hands Sten the cudgel, and everyone stands in
text: respectful, contemplative silence.
text: Dani is GRIPPING Christian’s arm. She is completely shell-

text: Meanwhile, Dani’s confusion and fear is beginning to subside.

text: SWELLS and DEFLATES (as we saw before, with the mushroom
dialog: trip).
text: SERVERS appear with plates. Dani is the first person to

text: clearly suffering a bad trip. He looks in Dani’s direction.
text: They LOCK EYES, but communicate nothing to each other. They

text: Humming and music has started very quietly outside.
text: Christian has been secured into the giant bear carcass. The
text: incision (from its groin to its neck) has been SEWN UP. The
text: bear’s JAW has been removed, creating a gap. HOLE (down to
text: its upper chest) through which Christi n’s Fate is visible.
text: Five Hargan labourers plant the bear carcass in the CENTER of
text: the hay platform. Its back rests against a hay pile. Christian
text: is still unable to move or speak. His muffled screams persist.
text: A man dressed as “Vidorr” (god of vengeance ) stands before
text: Christian. He holds the Rubi Radr in his hands.

text: Mats leaves the house. Now, THREE HARGAN MEN enter with
text: FLAMING TORCHES. The music begins to rise outside, including
text: the wordless, microtonal SINGING we’ve come to recognize.
text: The men approach Christian, whose “screaming” has become
text: horribly frenzied.
text: The men move to different sides of the hay platform. They
text: form a TRIANGLE. Simultaneously, they touch their torches to
text: the hay - igniting a FIRE.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - SAME TIME 119
text: The torch-men exit the house. Inside, the fire has begun to
text: spread along the platform.
text: The music rises as the fire picks up. The SINGING, which
text: wavers in trembling anticipation, has not yet found harmony.
text: Dani watches this with dissociated eyes. She stands tensely
text: in the field, eyes locked on the fire. Behind her, all of
text: Harga is enraptured.
scene_heading: INT. SACRED HOUSE - SAME TIME 120
text: The fire has grown considerabl Inside the bear, Christian
text: is now being steam-boiled in t é animal’s fluids:
text: The bear's FUR begins to catch fire. Before long, the whole
text: animal is swallowed in the blaze. Christian’s wretched face
text: becomes invisible behind the flames.
text: Ulf and Ingemar (still smiling) watch this with detached
dialog: fascination.
text: The fire has now spread to other piles of hay. It has begun
text: to crawl up the walls of the house.
text: Ulf is suddenly consumed by flames. He SCREAMS!
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - SAME TIME 121
text: Ulf£’s screams are heard from the Sacred House. Suddenly, every
text: member of the Hargan community (who is not singing) begins to
text: SCREAM as well. Feeling Ulf’'s pain, they emit a horrible chorus
text: of wails. When Ulf’s screams die down, So do theirs.
text: Meanwhile, Ruben has been given paper to PAINT on. Two elders
dialog: encourage him.
text: DANI, watching the burning house with fraught eyes, is
text: suddenly met with a wave of conflicting emotions. Her
text: expression curdles into one of sheer HORROR and DISGUST. Then
text: it becomes one of deep SORROW and SHAME. Her eyes well with
text: tears. The singing has now HARMONIZED and has risen to an
text: insane, operatic pitch.
text: We cut to an immense WIDE. Dani’s back is in the f.g. and the
text: burning house is in the b.g. Overcome, Dani buries her face in
text: her hands. Breaking into gentle sobs, she begins to walk
text: aimlessly to the side. We TRACK alongside her, keeping her
text: centered, She is circling the house, pulling at her hair and
text: face in increasing anguish. She is WEEPING now, and the house
text: fever= present in the b.g.) has become ENGULFED in the raging
dialog: ames.
text: Dani begins MOANING and SCREAMING. Her howls almost harmonize
text: with the singing in the b.g. The fire ROARS and CRACKLES in
text: the distance. It’s apocalyptic.

text: Soon it’s uncertain whether Dani is crying or LAUGHING. ,Her
text: legs become weak and she collapses to her knees. Four Hargans
text: (one of them being Pelle) run into the scene, carrying a
text: LARGE CHAIR - Dani’s throne.
text: The Hargans lift Dani by the arms and SEAT her in the throne.
text: They then HOIST the chair into the air.
text: On the upward LIFT, we cut to a tight CLOSE-UP of Dani's
text: face. She is being’ carried forward. Her expression, which
text: begins as one of great distress, slowly starts to TURN. Her
text: agony subsides into sudden CONFUSION. What’s happening?
dialog: ere am I? I’m on this chair, being carried! Her expression
text: goes from FEAR to EXCITEMENT to CONFUSION again, She
text: suddenly lets out an abrupt LAUGH which we can’t hear over
text: the music and the now-deafening FI Dani is now being
text: taken over by an invading sense of Biiae and contentment.
text: This soon evolves into a manic exhilaration. Dani BEAMS. She
text: has been embraced by a new family. She is Queen. She is not
dialog: alone.
text: A SMILE finally breaks onto Dani’s face. (For some, this smile
