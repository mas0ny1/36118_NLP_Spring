dialog: Please Read This Bit Before Reading The Screenplay:
dialog: This is the official 'Unoffical' Monty Python And The Holy Grail screenplay.
dialog: This file contains the script as it was on March 20 1974, before filming took
dialog: place. There are many minor differences from what appears here and what
text: ended up on the screen. <I.E. A paraphrased word or two or another
dialog: character used a line... But generally in minor lines like 'LOOK!'>
text: This file also contains cut scenes and lines from the film.
dialog: I tried to preserve as much of the screenplay as possible but it isn't
text: easy to cross out a section and pencil in new dialogue, in ASCII.
dialog: Any Scene or dialogue that was crossed out begins with a "|" before it.
dialog: Anything Penciled in has a "+", I also put cut information before penciled in.
dialog: What is interesting about a screenplay is to see what they threw out and
dialog: what "Catch Phrases" were literally penciled in. The reason I keyed in
dialog: this file was caused by me downloading current transcript going
dialog: around internet. It was an amazing job... I wouldn't want to have attempted
dialog: what he did... But it wasn't in a good script format and I didn't like how
dialog: direction was written in. Since I HAD the real screenplay I thought...
dialog: What the hell!
dialog: After This I plan to key in "Monty Python's Second Film" it is the 1st draft
dialog: of the Holy Grail. It is the script that eventually got canabalized into
dialog: sketches for the 4th season of Python. It Is sill quite different and well
dialog: worth a read. is anybody interested in it?????
dialog: Oh yes... I will STRESS this fact once more... THIS IS A SCREENPLAY... So
dialog: don't yell at me if a line is paraphrased in the film... This is what was
dialog: written before filming took place and it is still quite accurate.
dialog: Enough of this...
dialog: -Grue (09-Aug-92)
dialog: P.S. TO AHH: DON'T YOU KNOW WHO CONNIE BOOTH OR CAROL CLEVELAND IS?!?!?!
dialog: AND DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT GRAHAM CHAPMAN SOUNDS LIKE?!?!?! Sorry I just had to
dialog: say that... As the complete and total bastard that I am.

dialog: "Monty Python and the Holy Grail"
scene_heading: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
scene_heading: 1 EXTERIOR - CASTLE WALLS - DAY
text: Mist. Several seconds of it swirling about. silence
text: possibly, atmospheric music. SUPERIMPOSE "England AD 787".
text: after a few more seconds we hear hoofbeats in the distance.
text: They come slowly closer. Then out of the mist comes KING ARTHUR
text: followed by a SERVANT who is banging two half coconuts
text: together. ARTHUR raises his hand.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Whoa there!
text: SERVANT makes noises of horses halting, with a flourish. ARTHUR
text: peers through the mist. CUT TO shot from over his shoulder:
text: castle (e.g. Bodium) rising out of the mist. On the castle
text: battlements a SOLDIER is dimly seen. He peers down.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Halt! Who goes there?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle
dialog: of Camelot. King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons,
dialog: sovereign of all England!
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Get away!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I am... And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the
dialog: length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join
dialog: our court at Camelot.. I must speak with your lord and master.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: What? Ridden on a horse?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: You're using coconuts!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: ...What?
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging
dialog: them together.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (Scornfully)
dialog: So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this
dialog: land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Where did you get the coconuts?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Through ... We found them.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Found them? In Mercea. The coconut's tropical!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Well, this is a temperate zone.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin
dialog: or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are
dialog: not strangers to our land.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Not at all. They could be carried.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | Why not?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SOLDIER
dialog: | I'll tell you why not ... because a swallow is about eight
dialog: | inches long and weighs five ounces, and you'd be lucky
dialog: | to find a coconut under a pound.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: It could grip it by the husk ...
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: It's not a question of where he grips it, It's a simple
dialog: matter of weight - ratios ... A five-ounce bird could not
dialog: hold a a one pound coconut.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Well, it doesn't matter. Go and tell your master that
dialog: Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
text: A Slight pause. Swirling mist. Silence.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat
dialog: its wings four hundred and ninety three times every
dialog: second. right?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: Please!
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Am I right?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I'm not interested.
speaker_heading: SECOND SOLDIER
dialog: (who has loomed up on the battlements)
dialog: It could be carried by an African swallow!
speaker_heading: FIRST SOLDIER
dialog: Oh yes! An African swallow maybe ... but not a European
dialog: swallow. that's my point.
speaker_heading: SECOND SOLDIER
dialog: Oh yes, I agree there ...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (losing patience)
dialog: Will you ask your master if he wants to join the Knights
dialog: of Camelot?!
speaker_heading: FIRST SOLDIER
dialog: But then of course African swallows are non-migratory.
speaker_heading: SECOND SOLDIER
dialog: Oh yes.
text: ARTHUR raises his eyes heavenwards and nods to PATSY. They turn
text: and go off into the mist.
speaker_heading: FIRST SOLDIER
dialog: So they wouldn't be able to bring a coconut back anyway.
speaker_heading: SECOND SOLDIER
dialog: Wait a minute! Suppose two swallows carried it together?
speaker_heading: FIRST SOLDIER
dialog: No, they'd have to have it on a line.
text: Stillness. Silence again.
scene_heading: 2 ANIMATION/LIVE ACTION SEQUENCE - DEATH AND DEVASTATION
text: CUT TO Terry Gilliam's sequence of Brueghel prints. Sounds of
text: strange medieval music. Discordant and sparse. Wailings and
text: groanings. The last picture mixes through into live action.
text: BIG CLOSE UP of contorted face upside down. A leg falls across
text: it. Creaking noise. The bodies lurch away from CAMERA to
text: reveal they are amongst a huge pile of bodies on a swaying cart
text: that is lumbering away from CAMERA. It is pulled by a couple of
text: ragged, dirty emaciated WRETCHES. Behind the cart walks another
text: MAN who looks slightly more prosperous, but only on the scale
text: of complete and utter impoverishment. He wears a black hood and
dialog: looks sinister.
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: Bring out your dead!
text: We follow the cart through a wretched, impoverished plague-ridden
text: village. A few starved mongrels run about in the mud scavenging.
text: In the open doorway of one house perhaps we jug glimpse a pair of
text: legs dangling from the ceiling. In another doorway an OLD WOMAN
text: is beating a cat against a wall rather like one does with a mat.
text: The cart passes round a dead donkey or cow in the mud. And a MAN
text: tied to a cart is being hammered to death by four NUNS with
dialog: huge mallets.
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: Bring out your dead!
text: There are legs stick out of windows and doors. Two MEN are fighting
text: in the mud - covered from head to foot in it. Another MAN is on his
text: hands in knees shovelling mud into his mouth. We just catch
text: sight of a MAN falling into a well.
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: Bring out your dead!
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: Here's one!
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: Ninepence.
speaker_heading: BODY
dialog: I'm not dead!
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: Nothing... There's your ninepence.
speaker_heading: BODY
dialog: I'm not dead!
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: 'Ere. He says he's not dead.
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: Yes he is.
speaker_heading: BODY
dialog: I'm not!
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: He isn't.
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: He will be soon. He's very ill.
speaker_heading: BODY
dialog: I'm getting better!
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: You're not. You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: I can't take him like this. It's against regulations.
speaker_heading: BODY
dialog: I don't want to go on the cart.
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: Don't be such a baby.
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: I can't take him.
speaker_heading: BODY
dialog: I feel fine.
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: Do me a favour.
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes. He won't
dialog: be long.
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: I promised I'd be at the Robinson's. They've lost nine
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: When's your next round?
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: Thursday.
speaker_heading: BODY
dialog: I think I'll go for a walk.
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: You're not fooling anyone you know.
speaker_heading: (to CART DRIVER)
dialog: Isn't there anything you could do?
speaker_heading: BODY
dialog: (singing unrecognisably)
dialog: I feel happy... I feel happy.
text: The CART DRIVER looks at the LARGE MAN for a moment. Then they both
text: do a quick furtive look up and down the street. The CART DRIVER
text: very swiftly brings up a club and hits the OLD MAN. (Out of shot
text: but the singing stops after a loud bonk noise.)
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: (handing over the money at last)
dialog: Thanks very much.
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: That's all right. See you on Thursday.
text: They turn ... Suddenly all the village fall to their knees, touching
text: forelocks etc. ARTHUR and PATSY ride into SHOT, slightly nose to
text: the air, they ride through without acknowledging anybody. After
text: they pass, the LARGE MAN turns to the CART DRIVER.
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: Who's that then?
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: (Grudgingly)
dialog: I dunno, Must be a king.
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CART DRIVER
dialog: He hasn't got shit all over him.
speaker_heading: 3 EXTERIOR - DAY
text: ARTHUR and PATSY riding. They stop and look. We see a castle in the
text: distance, and before it a PEASANT is working away on his knees trying
text: to dig up the earth with his bare hands and a twig. ARTHUR and
text: PATSY ride up, and stop before the PEASANT
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Old woman!
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Man!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Man. I'm sorry. Old man, What knight live in that castle
dialog: over there?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I'm thirty-seven.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DENNIS:
dialog: I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR:
dialog: Well - I can't just say: "Hey, Man!'
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Well you could say: "Dennis"
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I didn't know you were called Dennis.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: You didn't bother to find out, did you?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind
dialog: you looked ...
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: What I object to is that you automatically treat me like
dialog: an inferior ...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Well ... I AM king.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Oh, very nice. King, eh! I expect you've got a palace and fine
dialog: clothes and courtiers and plenty of food. And how d'you get that?
dialog: By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist
dialog: dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our
dialog: society! If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
speaker_heading: An OLD WOMAN appears.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ... Oh!
dialog: how d'you do?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ...
dialog: can you tell me who lives in that castle?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: King of the WHO?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: The Britons.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Who are the Britons?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: All of us are ... we are all Britons.
text: DENNIS winks at the OLD WOMAN.
dialog: ... and I am your king ....
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Ooooh! I didn't know we had a king. I thought we were
dialog: an autonomous collective ...
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: You're fooling yourself. We're living in a dictatorship,
dialog: A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes ...
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: There you are, bringing class into it again ...
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: That's what it's all about ... If only -
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Please, please good people. I am in haste. What knight lives in
dialog: that castle?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: No one live there.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Well, who is your lord?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: We don't have a lord.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I told you, We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune, we take
text: it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: ... But all the decision of that officer ...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yes, I see.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: ... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority
dialog: in the case of purely internal affairs.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Be quiet!
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: ... but a two-thirds majority ...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Be quiet! I order you to shut up.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I am your king!
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Well, I didn't vote for you.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You don't vote for kings.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Well, how did you become king, then?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
text: The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
dialog: held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by
dialog: Divine Providence ... that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ...
dialog: That is why I am your king!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | OLD WOMAN
dialog: | Is Frank in? He'd be able to deal with this one.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: DENNIS
text: Look, strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out
dialog: swords ... that's no basis for a system of government. Supreme
dialog: executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from
dialog: some farcical aquatic ceremony.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Be quiet!
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: You can't expect to wield supreme executive power
dialog: just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some
dialog: moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would
dialog: put me away!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (Grabbing him by the collar)
dialog: Shut up, will you. Shut up!
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Shut up!
text: PEOPLE (i.e. other PEASANTS) are appearing and watching.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Come and see the violence inherent in the system.
dialog: Help, help, I'm being repressed!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (aware that people are now coming out and watching)
dialog: Bloody peasant!
text: (pushes DENNIS over into mud and prepares to ride off)
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Oh, Did you hear that! What a give-away.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Come on, patsy.
dialog: They ride off.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: (in the background as we PULL OUT)
dialog: did you see him repressing me, then? That's what I've
dialog: been on about ...
scene_heading: 4 EXTERIOR - FOREST - DAY
text: MIX THROUGH to ARTHUR and PATSY riding through the forest. They pass rune
text: stones. We TRACK with them. CLOSE-UPS of their faces as they ride.
text: MIX to another TRACKING SHOT of them riding through the forest. They
text: come to a clearing and stop, looking ahead intently. Their eyes light up.
dialog: Sound FX of fight.
text: CUT TO their eyeline. A clearing on the other side of which is a rough
text: wooden foot-bridge across a stream. At the start of the bridge a
text: tremendous fight is going on. A huge BLACK KNIGHT in black armour, his

text: green armour. (Perhaps the GREEN KNIGHT's armour is identical to the
dialog: BLACK KNIGHT's save for the colour.)
text: CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY. They watch, growing more impressed
dialog: as they watch the fight.
text: CUT BACK TO the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT lunges at the BLACK KNIGHT, who
text: avoids the blow with a skillful side-step and parry, knocking the sword
text: out of the GREEN KNIGHT's hand.
text: CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY even more impressed.
text: CUT BACK TO the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT has drawn out a particularly nasty
text: mace or spiked ball and chain, much longer than the BLACK KNIGHT's sword.
text: ARTHUR narrows his eyes, wondering whether the BLACK KNIGHT will survive.
text: CUT BACK to the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT swings at the BLACK KNIGHT, who
text: ducks under the first swing, leaps over the second and starts to close
speaker_heading: on the GREEN KNIGHT.
text: CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY watching like a tennis match. Sound FX of the
text: fight reaching a climax. Four almighty clangs. Then Silence.
text: CUT BACK to see the GREEN KNIGHT stretched out. The BLACK KNIGHT
text: sheathes his sword.
text: ARTHUR looks at PATSY. Nods and they move forward.
text: CUT BACK TO the BLACK KNIGHT picking up the GREEN KNIGHT above his head
text: and hurling him into the river. ARTHUR and PATSY approach him.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight.
speaker_heading: | BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: | Who dares to challenge the Black Knight?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | I do not challenge you.
text: The BLACK KNIGHT stares impassively and says nothing.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
text: Hint of a pause as he waits for a reaction which dosn't come. ARTHUR is
dialog: only slightly thrown.
dialog: ... I seek the bravest and the finest knights in all
dialog: the world to join me in my court at Camelot ...
speaker_heading: The BLACK KNIGHT remains silent
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You have proved yourself worthy. ... Will you join me?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | A man of your strength and skill would be the chief of all
dialog: | my knights ...
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: | Never.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You make me sad. But so be it. Come Patsy.
text: As he moves, the BLACK KNIGHT bars the way.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: None shall pass.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: None shall pass.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must
dialog: cross this bridge.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: Then you shall die.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: I move for no man.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: So be it!
text: ARTHUR draws his sword and approaches the BLACK KNIGHT. A furious fight
text: now starts lasting about fifteen seconds at which point ARTHUR delivers
text: a mighty blow which completely severs the BLACK KNIGHT's left arm at
text: the shoulder. ARTHUR steps back triumphantly.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Now stand aside worthy adversary.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: (Glancing at his shoulder)
dialog: 'Tis but a scratch.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: A scratch? Your arm's off.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: No, it isn't.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (Pointing to the arm on ground)
dialog: Well, what's that then?
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: I've had worse.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You're a liar.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: Come on you pansy!
text: Another ten seconds furious fighting till ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHTS's
text: other arm off, also at the shoulder. The arm plus sword, lies on the ground.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Victory is mine.
dialog: (sinking to his knees)
dialog: I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: Come on then.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What?
text: He kicks ARTHUR hard on the side of the helmet. ARTHUR gets up still
text: holding his sword. The BLACK KNIGHT comes after him kicking.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: Had enough?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You stupid bastard. You havn't got any arms left.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: Course I have.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Look!
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: What! Just a flesh wound.
speaker_heading: (kicks ARTHUR)
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Stop that.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: (kicking him)
dialog: Had enough ... ?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I'll have your leg.
text: He is kicked.
dialog: Right!
text: The BLACK KNIGHT kicks him again and ARTHUR chops his leg off.
text: The BLACK KNIGHT keeps his balance with difficulty.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: I'll do you for that.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You'll what ... ?
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: Come Here.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What are you going to do. bleed on me?
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: I'm invincible!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You're a looney.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
text: ARTHUR takes his last leg off. The BLACK KNIGHT's body lands upright.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: All right, we'll call it a draw.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Come, Patsy.
text: ARTHUR and PATSY start to cross the bridge.
speaker_heading: BLACK KNIGHT
dialog: Running away eh? You yellow bastard, Come back here and take
dialog: what's coming to you. I'll bite your legs off!
speaker_heading: 5 EXTERIOR - DAY
text: A village. Sound of chanting of Latin canon, punctuated by short, sharp
text: cracks. It comes nearer. We see it is a line of MONKS ala SEVENTH SEAL
text: flagellation scene, chanting and banging themselves on the foreheads with
text: wooden boards. They pass a group of villagers who are dragging a beautiful
text: YOUNG WOMAN dressed as a witch through the streets. They drag her to a
text: strange house/ruin standing on a hill outside the village. A
text: strange-looking knight stands outside, SIR BEDEVERE.
speaker_heading: FIRST VILLAGER
dialog: We have found a witch. May we burn her?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: A Witch! Burn her!
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: How do you know she is a witch?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: She looks like one. Yes, she does.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Bring her forward.
text: They bring her forward - a beautiful YOUNG GIRL (MISS ISLINGTON) dressed up
dialog: as a witch.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: I am not a witch. I am not a witch.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: But you are dressed as one.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: They dressed me up like this.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: We didn't, we didn't!
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: This is not my nose, It is a false one.
text: BEDEVERE takes her nose off.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: FIRST VILLAGER
dialog: ... Well, we did do the nose.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: The nose?
speaker_heading: FIRST VILLAGER
dialog: And the hat. But she is a witch.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: A witch, a witch, burn her!
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Did you dress her up like this?
speaker_heading: FIRST VILLAGER
dialog: ... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Why do you think she is a witch?
speaker_heading: SECOND VILLAGER
dialog: She turned me into a newt.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: A newt?
speaker_heading: SECOND VILLAGER
dialog: (After looking at himself for some time)
dialog: I got better.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Burn her anyway.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Quiet! Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
text: ARTHUR and PATSY ride up at this point and watch what follows with interest
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: There are? Tell up. What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Tell me ... what do you do with witches?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Burn them.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: And what do you burn, apart from witches?
speaker_heading: FOURTH VILLAGER
dialog: ... Wood?
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: So why do witches burn?
speaker_heading: SECOND VILLAGER
dialog: (pianissimo)
dialog: ... Because they're made of wood...?
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Good.
text: PEASANTS stir uneasily then come round to this conclusion.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: I see. Yes, of course.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
speaker_heading: FIRST VILLAGER
dialog: Make a bridge out of her.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Ah. Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Does wood sink in water?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: No, no, It floats. Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her. To
dialog: the pond.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Wait. Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Bread? No, no, no. Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: A duck.
text: They all turn and look at ARTHUR. BEDEVERE looks up very impressed.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Exactly. So... logically ...
speaker_heading: FIRST VILLAGER
dialog: (beginning to pick up the thread)
dialog: If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: And therefore?
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: A witch! ... A duck! A duck! Fetch a duck.
speaker_heading: FOURTH VILLAGER
dialog: Here is a duck, Sir Bedevere.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: We shall use my largest scales.
text: He leads them a few yards to a very strange contraption indeed, made of
text: wood and rope and leather. They put the GIRL in one pan and the duck
text: in another. Each pan is supported by a wooden stave. BEDEVERE checks
text: each pan then ... ARTHUR looks on with interest.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Remove the supports.
text: Two PEASANTS knock them away with sledge hammers. The GIRL and the duck
dialog: swing slightly but balance perfectly.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: A witch! A witch!
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: It's a fair cop.
dialog: All
dialog: Burn her! Burn her! Let's make her into a ladder.
text: The VILLAGERS drag the girl away, leaving ARTHUR and BEDEVERE regarding
text: each other admiringly.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: My liege ... forgive me ...
text: ARTHUR looks at PATSY with obvious satisfaction.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot,
dialog: and join our number at the Round Table?
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: My liege, I am honored.
text: ARTHUR steps forward, drawing his sword, with a slight hint of difficulty
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What is your name?
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE

text: CUT TO interior of medieval hall. A large group of armoured KNIGHTS are
text: engaged in a well choreographed song-and-dance routine of the very up-beat
dialog: 'If they could see me now' type of fast bouncy number. The poorer verses
text: are made clearer by CUTTING to a group of knights actually engaged in
text: the described task while the line itself is sung. They sing:
speaker_heading: KNIGHTS
dialog: We're knights of the round table
dialog: We dance whene'er we're able
dialog: We do routines and chorus scenes
dialog: With footwork impeccable.
dialog: We dine well here in Camelot

dialog: We're knights of the Round Table
dialog: Our shows are formidable
dialog: But many times
dialog: We're given rhymes
dialog: That are quite unsingable
dialog: We're opera mad in Camelot
dialog: We sing from the diaphragm a lot.
text: Booming basses. A routine where two XYLOPHONISTS play parts of KNIGHTS'
dialog: armour producing a pleasing effect.
dialog: In war we're tough and able.
dialog: Quite indefatigable

dialog: It is a silly place.
text: They set off again almost immediately they are suffused in ethereal radiance

text: an enormous twenty-foot-high wooden rabbit is wheeled out of the
text: undergrowth into the open space in front of the castle. The ENGLISH scuttle
text: back into the undergrowth. The rabbit has a large red bow tied round it
text: and a rather crudely written label, which reads "Pour votres amis

text: CUT TO a MAN in modern dress standing outside a castle. He speaks straight
text: to CAMERA in a documentary kind of way.
dialog: SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION: A Very Famous Historian.
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN'S SPEECH
text: Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened
dialog: King Arthur ... The ferocity of the French taunting took him
dialog: completely by surprise and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy
dialog: was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought
text: to a successful conclusion. Arthur, having consulted his closest
dialog: knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail
dialog: individually. Now, this is what they did. No sooner...
text: A KNIGHT rides into shot and hacks him to the ground. He rides off.
text: We stay for a moment on the glade. A MIDDLE-AGED LADY in a C. & A.
text: twin-set emerges from the trees and looks in horror at the body of her
speaker_heading: HUSBAND.
speaker_heading: MRS HISTORIAN
speaker_heading: FRANK!
text: CUT TO animated frame, with the words "The Tale of Sir Robin" on it.
dialog: Pleasant pastoral music. MIX THROUGH TO:
dialog: + VOICE: "The Tale Of Sir Robin"
speaker_heading: 11 EXTERIOR - GLADE - DAY
text: A KNIGHT is trotting along through a wooden sun-dapled glade, followed by
text: his trusty PAGE banging the usual half coconuts. As we see them approach
text: we hear the beautiful lilting sound of medieval music, and see that
text: the KNIGHT is followed by a small retinue of MUSICIANS in
text: thirteenth-century courtly costume, one sings, and plays the tambourine,
text: one bangs at a tabor (A small drum O.E.D) and one plays the pipes.
text: The KNIGHT looks very proud and firm as we hear the first part of the song,
text: but the combination of the lyrics and the large signs they pass, start
dialog: to have their effect ...
speaker_heading: SONG:
dialog: Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot,
dialog: He was not afraid to die, Oh Brave Sir Robin,
dialog: He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways
dialog: Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin.
dialog: He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp
dialog: Or to have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken;
text: To have his kneecaps split and his body burned away
text: And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin.
text: His head smashed in, and his heart cut out,
text: And his liver removed, and his bowels unplugged,
dialog: And his nostrils raped, and his bottom burned off,
dialog: And his penis split ... and his ...
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads.
dialog: It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
speaker_heading: SINGERS
dialog: Brave, Sir Rob ...

text: They now pass three KNIGHTS impaled to a tree. With their feet off the

speaker_heading: | SECOND HEAD
dialog: | I'm still not sure.

speaker_heading: | THIRD HEAD
dialog: | All right. How many of me think I should kill him?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | FIRST HEAD
dialog: | I do.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | THIRD HEAD
dialog: | One.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND HEAD
dialog: | That's not a quorum.

speaker_heading: | THIRD HEAD
speaker_heading: | (to SIR ROBIN)
dialog: | Sorry about this but I have to be fair.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ROBIN
dialog: | Oh, that's all right. So you are going to kill me with your big axe.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | FIRST HEAD
dialog: | Er no, with my sword.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND HEAD
dialog: | Dagger.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | THIRD HEAD
dialog: | Mace is quicker.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | FIRST HEAD
dialog: | No, no, the sword, it's easier.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | THIRD HEAD
dialog: | He said axe.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ROBIN
dialog: | Look, hurry up six eyes, or I shall cut your head off.
dialog: |

speaker_heading: 13 EXTERIOR - GLADE - DAY
text: Quick sequence of SIR ROBIN. The music is jolly and bright, as if
text: triumphant. ROBIN is not at all happy with the lyrics.
speaker_heading: SINGERS
dialog: Brave Sir Robin ran away.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I didn't.
speaker_heading: SINGERS
text: Bravely ran away, away.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: No, no, no.
speaker_heading: SINGERS
dialog: When danger reared its ugly head,
dialog: He bravely turned his tail and fled
dialog: Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about
dialog: And gallantly he chickened out
text: Bravely taking to his feet
dialog: He beat a very brave retreat
dialog: Bravest of the brave Sir Robin
dialog: Petrified of being dead
dialog: Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin
dialog: Turned away and fled.
text: They disappear into distance.
dialog: ANIMATION: "The Tale Of Sir Galahad"
scene_heading: 14 EXTERIOR - STORM - FOREST - DUSK
text: As the storm rages we pick up GALAHAD forcing his way through brambles and
text: over slippery rocks. Progress is hard. He pauses and at this moment
text: we hear the howling of wolves. GALAHAD turns, then hurries onward even
text: more urgently. Another louder, closer howl is herd and GALAHAD stumbles
text: and falls heavily. Though obviously injured he bravely struggles
text: forward a little and regains his feed reacting with pain. More louder
text: closer howling. He grips his sword valiantly and as he glances around
text: a flash of lightning reveals the silhouette of a huge terrifying castle,
text: perhaps looking rather derelict. He makes up his mind in an instant and
text: stumbles manfully toward it. More louder howling. He reaches the
text: forbidding and enormous doors of the castle and beats on the doors with the
text: handle of his sword, looking over his shoulder the while. Pause.
dialog: He beats again, shouting:
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Open. Open the doors. In the name of King Arthur. Open the doors.
dialog: | I am Sir Galahad, a knight of the Round Table.
dialog: |
dialog: | Some suitable noises are herd inside.
dialog: |
dialog: | I am on a quest for the Holy Grail. I seek shelter.
text: Some rattling chainy noises come from inside with huge bolts being
text: drawn. The wolves' howling is very close. As the door creaks
text: open GALAHAD steps quickly inside.
scene_heading: 15 INTERIOR - CASTLE - NIGHT
text: From inside we see GALAHAD enter, wiping the rain from his eyes, and turn
text: as the door crashes behind him. GALAHAD turns to the door reacting to the
dialog: fact he is trapped.
speaker_heading: ZOOT (OUT OF VISION)
dialog: Hello!
text: GALAHAD turns back. We see from his POV the lovely ZOOT standing by him
text: smiling enchantingly and a number of equally delectable GIRLIES draped
text: around in the seductively poulticed room. They look at him smilingly and
dialog: wave.
speaker_heading: GIRLIES
dialog: Hello!
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: Welcome, gentle Sir knight, welcome to the Castle Anthrax.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: The Castle Anthrax?
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: Yes. It's not a very good name, is it? But we are
dialog: nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Er ...
dialog: + You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: The what? But you are tired and you must rest awhile. Midget!
dialog: Crapper!
speaker_heading: MIDGET AND CRAPPER
dialog: Yes, O Zoot?
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: Prepare a bed for our guest.
speaker_heading: MIDGET AND CRAPPER
dialog: (grovelling with delight)
dialog: Oh thank you, Zoot, thank you, thank you.
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: Away varletesses!
speaker_heading: (to GALAHAD)
dialog: The beds here are warm and soft and very, very big.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Well, look er, I ...
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: What is your name, handsome knight?
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot
dialog: (she is very close to him for a moment)
dialog: But come.
text: She turns away and leads him towards a door leading to a corner leading
dialog: to the bedchamber
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: Sir Galahad!!
text: There is a gasp from the other GIRLS
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.
text: GALAHAD looks at the other GIRLS. They are clearly on the verge of
dialog: being offended.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Well ...
speaker_heading: ZOOT
text: (she moves off and GALAHAD unwillingly follows)
dialog: I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared
dialog: to yours. We are but eightscore young blondes, all between
dialog: sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no
dialog: one to protect us. Oooh. It is a lonely life ... bathing ...
dialog: dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
text: They reach the end of the corridor and enter the bedchamber.
speaker_heading: ZOOT turns
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: We are just not used to handsome knights ...
dialog: (she notices him limping)
dialog: But you are wounded!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: No, It's nothing!
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: You must see the doctors immediately.
dialog: (she claps again)
dialog: You must lie down.
text: She almost forces him to lie on the bed as PIGLET and WINSTON enter the
text: room. They are equally beautiful and dressed exotically. They
speaker_heading: approach GALAHAD.
speaker_heading: PIGLET
dialog: Well, what seems to be the trouble?
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: They're doctors?
speaker_heading: ZOOT
dialog: They have a basic medical training, yes. Now you must try to rest.
dialog: Dr. Winston! Dr. Piglet! Practice your art!!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Try to relax.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
speaker_heading: PIGLET
dialog: We must examine you.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: There's nothing wrong with ... that.
speaker_heading: PIGLET
dialog: (slightly irritated)
dialog: Please ... we are doctors.
text: ZOOT reappears. GALAHAD tries for one brief moment to relax. Then there is
text: a sharp boing from the lower part of his armour. WINSTON glances quickly
text: in the appropriate direction as GALAHAD sits up and starts getting off the
dialog: bed and collecting his armour, saying:
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: No, no, this cannot be. I am sworn to chastity!
speaker_heading: PIGLET
dialog: Back to your bed! At once!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: I'm sorry, I must go.
text: GALAHAD hurries to the door and pushes through it. As he leaves the room
text: we CUT TO the reverse to show that he is now in a room full of bathing
text: and romping GIRLIES, all innocent, wide-eyed and beautiful. They smile
text: enchantingly at him as he tries to keep walking without being diverted by
text: the lovely sights assaulting his eyeballs. He nods to them stiffly once
text: or twice and then his eye catches a particularly stunning YOUNG LADY.
text: He visibly gulps with repressed emotion and cannot resist saying:
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | GALAHAD
dialog: | Good evening ... Ah, Zoot! Er ...
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | DINGO
dialog: | No, I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | GALAHAD
dialog: | Oh. Well, I'm sorry, but I must leave immediately.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | DINGO
dialog: | (very dramatically)
dialog: | No! Oh, no! Bad ... bad Zoot.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | GALAHAD
dialog: | Er, why?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | DINGO
dialog: | She has been lying again ... she told us you had promised to
dialog: | stay for ever!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | GALAHAD
dialog: | Oh!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + GALAHAD
dialog: + Oh ... will you excuse me?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + DINGO
dialog: + Where are you going?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + GALAHAD
dialog: + I have seen the Grail! I have seen it - here in this castle!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + DINGO
dialog: + No! Oh, no! Bad ... bad Zoot!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + GALAHAD
dialog: + What is it?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + DINGO
dialog: + Bad, wicked, naughty Zoot! She has been setting fire to our beacon,
dialog: + which - I have just remembered - is grail-shaped ... It is not the
dialog: + first time we've had this problem.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + GALAHAD
dialog: + It's not the real Grail?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + DINGO
dialog: Wicked wicked Zoot ... she is a bad person and she must pay the
dialog: penalty. And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment
dialog: ... you must tie her down on a bed ... and spank her. Come!
speaker_heading: GIRLS
dialog: A spanking! A spanking!
speaker_heading: DINGO
dialog: You must spank her well and after you have spanked her you
dialog: may deal with her as you like and then ... spank me.
speaker_heading: AMAZING
dialog: And spank me!
speaker_heading: STUNNER
dialog: And me.
speaker_heading: LOVELY
dialog: And me.
speaker_heading: DINGO
dialog: Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!
speaker_heading: GIRLS
dialog: A spanking. A spanking. There is going to be a spanking tonight.
speaker_heading: DINGO
dialog: And after the spanking ... the oral sex.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Oh, dear! Well, I...
speaker_heading: GIRLS
dialog: The oral sex ... The oral sex.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Well, I suppose I could stay a BIT longer.
text: At this moment there is a commotion behind and SIR LAUNCELOT and CONCORD,
text: possibly plus GAWAIN, burst into the bathing area with swords drawn and
text: form themselves round SIR GALAHAD threatening the GIRLS.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Sir Galahad!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Oh ... hello ...
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Quick!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: You are in great peril.
speaker_heading: DINGO
dialog: No he isn't
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Silence! Foul temptress!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Well, she's got a point.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: We'll cover your escape!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Look - I'm fine!
speaker_heading: GIRLS
dialog: Sir Galahad!
dialog: He threatens DINGO.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: No. Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!
speaker_heading: GIRLS
dialog: Yes, yes, let him Tackle us single-handed!
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: No, really, I can cope. I can handle this lot easily!
speaker_heading: DINGO
dialog: Yes, let him handle us easily.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: No sir. Quick!
text: He starts pulling GALAHAD away.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: No, please. Please! I can defeat them! There's only a hundred.
speaker_heading: GIRLS
dialog: He will beat us easily. We haven't a chance.
speaker_heading: DINGO
dialog: Oh shit!
text: By now LAUNCELOT and CONCORDE have hustled GALAHAD out of the bathing
text: area and are running through the outside door.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: We were in the nick of time. You were in great peril.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: (dragging his feet somewhat)
dialog: I don't think I was.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: It's too perilous.
dialog: They are right outside the castle by now.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: No, no, we must find the Grail.
text: The thunderstorm is over. A bunch (sic) of PAGES are tethered to a tree with
text: more MEN waiting. Their tethers are untied and the PAGES start banging away
text: with their coconuts. GALAHAD is swept along with them as they ride off.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: No. It's unhealthy.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: ... I Bet you're gay.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: No, I'm not.
text: GAWAIN or CONCORDE gives a knowing glance at LAUNCELOT. VOICE comes in as
dialog: they ride off.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Sir Launcelot had saved Galahad from almost certain
dialog: temptation but they were still lost, far from the goal
dialog: of their search for the Holy Grail. Only Bedevere and
dialog: King Arthur himself, riding day and night, had made
dialog: any progress.
speaker_heading: 16 ANIMATION/LIVE ACTION
text: ARTHUR and BEDEVERE in the depths of a dark forest with an old blind
text: SOOTHSAYER. He lies in a broken down old woodman's hut.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: And this "Enchanter" of whom you speak, he has seen the grail?
text: The SOOTHSAYER laughs forbiddingly, adding to the general spookiness of
dialog: this encounter.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Where does he live?
text: (he stares into the blind eyes of the OLD MAN)
dialog: Old man ... where does he live ...
speaker_heading: SOOTHSAYER
dialog: He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
text: The BLIND MAN laughs again to himself.
speaker_heading: SOOTHSAYER
dialog: There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge
dialog: of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
speaker_heading: SOOTHSAYER
dialog: Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
text: The OLD MAN laughs sinisterly and mockingly. They look down and he is
text: gone. They stand up. Suddenly behind them is a noise. They turn sharply
text: in the door of the little hut is a cat. It miaows and is gone. They
text: slowly back out of the hut. As they touch the doorposts they just flake
text: away into dust. The whole hut is rotten. It collapses
text: Spooky music. They are thoroughly shaken, and they begin to hear noises of
text: people moving in the forest around them. They start to back cautiously
text: away from the hut, suddenly there is heavy footfall behind them. They
dialog: turn in fear and:
text: Sudden CUT TO BIG CLOSE-UP of a frightening black-browed evil face.
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT OF NI
dialog: Ni!
text: ARTHUR and BEDEVERE recoil in abject fear. PATSY rears up with coconuts.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
speaker_heading: (to PATSY)
dialog: Easy ... boy, easy ...
text: ARTHUR peers into the darkness.
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: SIX VOICES FROM DARKNESS
dialog: NI! ... Peng! ... Neeee ... Wom!
text: An extraordinary TALL KNIGHT in all black (possibly John with Mike on his
text: shoulders) walks out from the dark trees. He is extremely fierce and
text: gruesome countenance. He walks towards KING ARTHUR and PATSY, who are
dialog: wazzing like mad. (Salopian slang, meaning very scared. almost to the

speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Father, lad.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing. All I had when
dialog: I started was swamp ... other kings said I was daft to build a
dialog: castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em.
dialog: It sank into the swamp. So I built a another one ... that sank
dialog: into the swamp. I built another one ... That fell over and THEN
dialog: sank into the swamp .... So I built another ... and that stayed up.
dialog: ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in

speaker_heading: FATHER

speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: No. Until I come and get him.
speaker_heading: SECOND GUARD

speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: No ... You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: ... and you'll come and get him.
speaker_heading: SECOND GUARD
dialog: Hic.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: That's Right.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him
dialog: entering the room.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Leaving the room.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: Leaving the room ... yes.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Got it?
speaker_heading: SECOND GUARD
dialog: Hic.
text: FARTHER makes to leave.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD

speaker_heading: FATHER

speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD

dialog: (trying to remember what he was going to say)
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Look, it's simple. Just stay here and make sure he doesn't

speaker_heading: SECOND GUARD
dialog: Hic.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: No .... keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD

speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: No ... just keep him in here.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD

speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: No, not anyone else - just me.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD

speaker_heading: SECOND GUARD
dialog: Hic.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: Get back.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD

speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: And make sure he doesn't leave.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Make sure he doesn't leave.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: The Prince ... ?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Yes ... make sure ...
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: Oh yes, of course! I thought you meant him!
text: (he points to the other GUARD and laughs to himself)
dialog: You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when
dialog: he's a guard ...
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Is that clear?
speaker_heading: SECOND GUARD
dialog: Hic.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: Oh, yes. That's quite clear. No problems.
text: FATHER pulls open the door and makes to leave the room. The GUARDS follow.
speaker_heading: FATHER
speaker_heading: (to the GUARDS)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: We're coming with you.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave
dialog: the room until I get back.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: Oh, I see, Right.
text: They take up positions on either side of the door.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: But, Father.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Shut your noise, you, and get that suit on!
text: He points to a wedding suit on a table or chair. FATHER throws one last
text: look at the BOY and turns, goes out and slams the door.
text: The PRINCE slumps onto window seat, looking forlornly out of the window.
text: MUSIC INTRO to song ...
text: The door flies open, the music cuts off and FATHER pokes his head in.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: And no singing!
speaker_heading: SECOND GUARD
dialog: Hic.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (as he goes out.)
dialog: Go and have a drink of water.
text: FATHER slams the door again. The GUARDS take up their positions. The SON
text: gazes out of the window again ... sighs ... thinks ... a thought strikes him
text: ... he gets up, crosses to his desk and scribbles a quick note and impales
text: it on an arrow ... takes a bow down from the wall ... and fires the arrow
dialog: out of the window.
text: He looks wetly defiant at the GUARDS, who smile pleasantly.
scene_heading: 15 EXTERIOR - A FOREST - DAY
text: CUT TO the middle of the forest. SIR LAUNCELOT is riding along with
dialog: a trusty servant, CONCORDE.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: And ... o v e r ... we go!
text: He strides over a big tree trunk ... his "horse" does run and jump ...
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: (enthusiastically)
dialog: Well taken, Concorde!
speaker_heading: CONCORDE
dialog: Thank you, sir, most kind ...
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: And another!
text: CONCORDE misses a beat.
dialog: Steady! Good ... and the last one ...
text: CONCORDE does the run-up with the coconuts. He does the break for the
text: leap ... there is a thwack. SIR LAUNCELOT is waiting for the horse
dialog: to land.
speaker_heading: CONCORDE
dialog: Message for you, sir.
text: He falls forward revealing the arrow with the note.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Concorde - speak to me.
text: He realises he might be in danger and so starts to crawl off ...
text: when he notices the note. He takes it out and reads it.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "To whoever finds this note -
dialog: I have been imprisoned by my father who wishes me to marry
dialog: against my will. Please please please please come and rescue me.
dialog: I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle."
text: SIR LAUNCELOT's eyes light up with holy inspiration.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
text: At last! A call! A cry of distress ...
text: (he draws his sword, and turns to CONCORDE)
dialog: Concorde! Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
speaker_heading: CONCORDE
dialog: I'm not quite dead, sir ...
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: (a little deflated)
dialog: Oh, well ... er brave Concorde! You shall not have been fatally
dialog: wounded in vain!
speaker_heading: CONCORDE
dialog: I think I could pull through, sir.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
text: He makes to leap off dramatically.
speaker_heading: CONCORDE
dialog: I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished
dialog: this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
speaker_heading: CONCORDE
dialog: Really, I feel fine, sir.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Farewell, Concorde!
speaker_heading: CONCORDE
dialog: It just seems silly ... me lying here.
text: SIR LAUNCELOT plunges off into the forest.
scene_heading: 20 EXTERIOR - CASTLE GATEWAY - DAY
text: Two hanging banners one each side of the gate with the monogram:
dialog: "H & L".
text: TWO SENTRIES with spears ... slightly weddingly ... red ribbons on their
text: right spears. We can hear from inside revelry and celebration music.
text: We hear LAUNCELOT's footsteps. The TWO SENTRIES are watching him. One of
text: them raises his hand.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | FIRST SENTRY
dialog: | Halt, friend ...
dialog: |
text: LAUNCELOT leaps into SHOT with a mighty cry and runs the GUARD through and
text: hacks him to the floor. Blood. Swashbuckling music (perhaps).
text: LAUNCELOT races through into the castle screaming.
speaker_heading: SECOND SENTRY
dialog: Hey!
text: He looks down at his mutilated comrade.
speaker_heading: 21 EXTERIOR - DAY
text: CUT TO inside of the castle grounds or courtyard.
text: in the sunlight beautifully dressed WEDDING GUESTS are arriving.
text: Converging on a doorway. A country dance in progress.
text: SIR LAUNCELOT rushes towards them.
text: CUT TO HAND-HELD CLOSE-UPS as he charges through the crowd, hacking
text: right and left a la Errol Flynn at all who come in his way.
text: He fights his way through the country dance. Blood. Shrieks. Bemused
text: looks of GUESTS - not horror so much as uncomprehending surprise.
dialog: Possibly Errol Flynn music.
text: One COUNTRY DANCER is left holding just a hand.
text: Right and left the GUESTS crumple in pools of blood as he fights his
text: way through the door and into the main hall.
speaker_heading: 22 INTERIOR - DAY
text: CUT TO interior of main hall. Sound of busy preparations. MEN setting
text: up huge hogsheads of wine. MEN putting up last minute flower arrangements.
text: COOKS bearing huge trays of food, pies, suckling pigs, a swan, boar's
dialog: head, etc.
text: The BRIDE being dressed by several ATTENDANTS. FATHER ordering SERVANTS
dialog: around - organizing the STEWARDS etc.
text: SIR LAUNCELOT bursts through the middle of them, slashing heroically,
text: hacking, wounding and killing. Again fairly CLOSE-UP chaotic SHOTS.
text: We see GUESTS stagger back wounded - a COOK bites the dust, etc.
text: SIR LAUNCELOT eventually reaches the staircase ... runs up it and
text: into a small door.
speaker_heading: 23 INTERIOR - DAY
text: CUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT running up spiral staircase. He reaches the door
text: of the PRINCE's room. he flings it open.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: Ah! Now ... we're not allowed to ...
text: SIR LAUNCELOT runs him through, grabs his spear and stabs the other
text: guard who collapses in a heap. Hiccoughs quietly.
text: SIR LAUNCELOT runs to the window and kneels down in front of the PRINCE,
text: averting his head.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot,
dialog: from the Court of Camelot. I have come to take you ...
text: (he looks up for the first time and his voice trails away)
dialog: away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: You got my note!
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Well ... yes ...
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: You've come to rescue me?
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: (his eyes light up)
dialog: I knew that someone would come. I knew ... somewhere out there ...
dialog: there must be ...
text: MUSIC INTRO to song.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (suddenly looking in the door)
dialog: Stop that!
dialog: Music cuts out.
text: FATHER sees SIR LAUNCELOT still kneeling before his son.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: I'm ... your son ...
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Not you.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: (half standing self-consciously)
dialog: I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: He's come to rescue me, father.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Did you kill all those guards?
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Yes ... I'm very sorry ...
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: They cost fifty pounds each!
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ...
dialog: I can explain everything ...
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: Don't be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot. I've got a rope here all
dialog: ready ...
text: He throws a rope out of the window which is tied to a pillar in the room
text: He looks rather pleased with himself that he has got it all ready.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: You killed eight wedding guests in all!
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I can understand that.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: (half out of the window)
dialog: Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (to his SON)
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: (to LAUNCELOT)
dialog: You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Didn't mean to? You put your sword right through his head!
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Gosh - Is he all right?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: You even kicked the bride in the chest! It's going to cost
dialog: me a fortune!
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: I can explain ... I was in the forest ... riding north
dialog: from Camelot ... when I got this note.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Camelot? Are you from Camelot?
text: The PRINCE's head peeps over the windowsill.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: Hurry!
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: 'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: PRINCE (out of vision)
dialog: I am ready, Sir Launcelot.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Do you want to come and have a drink?
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Oh ... that's awfully nice.
speaker_heading: PRINCE (OOV)
dialog: (loud and shrill)
dialog: I am ready!
text: As they walk past the rope, the FATHER nonchalantly cuts with his knife.
text: there is no sound except after a pause a slight squeal from very far away
text: as the PRINCE makes contact with the ground.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited
dialog: and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own
dialog: that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
text: He puts his arm round LAUNCELOT's shoulders as they go though the door.
speaker_heading: 24 INTERIOR - DAY
text: CUT TO the great hall. GUESTS wounded and bloody, are tending to the dead
text: and injured, sighs and groans, the PRINCESS in her white wedding dress is
text: holding her chest and coughing blood.
text: People dabbing the stains off her dress.
text: FATHER and SIR LAUNCELOT start to walk down the grand staircase. Talking
dialog: to each other.
text: One of the GUESTS notices and points to SIR LAUNCELOT.
speaker_heading: GUEST
dialog: There he is!
text: As one man all remaining able-bodied MEN look up and make for the staircase,
text: muttering angrily. SIR LAUNCELOT grabs his sword.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Hold it!
text: But it is too lake. SIR LAUNCELOT cannot be stopped. With fearless abandon
text: he throws himself into the CROWD and starts hacking and slashing. He has
text: carved quite a number up before the FATHER can stop him and pulls him back
text: onto the stairs. Renewed groans and cries.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (shouting above noise)
dialog: Hold it! Please!
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Sorry! Sorry ...
dialog: (with bitter self reproach)
dialog: There you See ... I just got excited again and I got carried away ...
dialog: I'm ever so sorry.
dialog: (to the CROWD)
dialog: Sorry.
text: CROWD kneeling round their wounded again. Moans etc.
speaker_heading: GUEST
dialog: He's killed the best man!
speaker_heading: SECOND GUEST
dialog: (holding a limp WOMAN)
dialog: He's killed my auntie.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: No, please! This is supposed to be a happy occasion!
dialog: Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who ... We
dialog: are here today to witness the union of two young people in
text: the joyful bond of the holy wedlock. Unfortunately, one
dialog: of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death.
text: Murmurs from CROWD; the BRIDE smiles with relief, coughs.
dialog: But I don't want to think I've not lost a son ...
dialog: so much as gained a daughter ...
text: Smattering of applause.
dialog: For, since the tragic death of her father ...
speaker_heading: SHOUT FROM BACK
dialog: He's not quite dead!
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Since the fatal wounding of her father ...
speaker_heading: SHOUT FROM BACK
dialog: I think He's getting better!
text: FATHER nods discreetly to a SOLDIER standing to one side. The SOLDIER
text: slips off. FATHER's eyes watch him move round to where the voice
dialog: came from.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: For ... since her own father ... who ... when he seemed about to
dialog: recover ... suddenly felt the icy ... hand of death upon him.
text: A scuffle at the back.
speaker_heading: SHOUT FROM BACK
dialog: Oh, he's died!
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: I want his only daughter, from now onwards, to think of me as her
dialog: old dad ... in a very real and legally binding sense.
dialog: Applause.
dialog: And I'm sure sure ... that the merger ... er ... the union
dialog: between the Princess and the brave but dangerous Sir Launcelot
dialog: of Camelot ...
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: What?
text: Gasp from the CROWD.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: The dead Prince!
text: There is CONCORDE holding "THE DEAD PRINCE" in his arms.
speaker_heading: CONCORDE
dialog: He's not quite dead!
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: I feel much better.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: I was saved at the last minute.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: Well ... I'll tell you ...
text: MUSIC INTRO to song. CONCORDE stands the SON on his feet and adopts cod
dialog: "and now a number from my friend" pose.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Not like that!
text: But the music doesn't stop and the CROWD starts to sing.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: He's going to tell.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: He's going to tell ...
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Shut UP!
text: As the song starts the FATHER tries yelling at them and eventually gives
text: up. SIR LAUNCELOT joins CONCORDE in the CROWD.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | LAUNCELOT
dialog: | We must escape. Quickly before the song.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | CONCORDE
dialog: | Come with me, sir.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | LAUNCELOT
dialog: | You're not right for this genre ... I must escape more dramatically.
dialog: |
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + CONCORDE
dialog: + Quickly, sir, come this way!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + LAUNCELOT
dialog: + No! It's not right for my idiom. I must escape more ... more ...
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + CONCORDE
dialog: + Dramatically, sir?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + LAUNCELOT
dialog: + Dramatically.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: He's going to tell
dialog: He's going to tell
dialog: He's going to tell about his great escape.
dialog: Oh he fell a long long way
dialog: But he's here with us today
dialog: What a wonderful ... escape.
text: CONCORDE goes. SIR LAUNCELOT runs back up the stairs, grabs a rope
text: of the wall and swings out over the heads of the CROWD in a
text: swashbuckling manner towards a large window. He stops just short
text: of the window and is left swing pathetically back and forth.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + LAUNCELOT
dialog: + Excuse me ... could somebody give me a push ...

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Very well, old crone. Since you will not assist us voluntarily
dialog: ... "Ni"!
speaker_heading: CRONE
dialog: No. Never. No shrubberies.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Ni!
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Nu!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: No. Ni! More like this. "Ni"!
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE

speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Ni!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR

text: A PASSER-BY on a horse is observing them.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Are you saying "Ni" to that old woman?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Erm, yes.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say "Ni"
dialog: at will to old ladies. There is a pestilence upon this land!
dialog: nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design
dialog: shrubberies are under considerable economic stress
dialog: at this point in time.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Did you say shrubberies?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Yes. Shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber. My name
dialog: is Roger the Shrubber. I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: (rather aggressively, to ROGER)
dialog: Ni!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: No. No. No!
scene_heading: 26 EXTERIOR - GLADE - DUSK
text: CUT TO the glade in the forest again.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery. May we go now?
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: That is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels particularly -
dialog: But there is one small problem.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
speaker_heading: ONE KNIGHT
dialog: Ni!
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: Sh!
speaker_heading: ONE KNIGHT
dialog: (wispers)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: We are now the Knights Who Go Neeeow ... wum ... ping!
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: Ni!
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: Ni!
speaker_heading: ONE KNIGHT
dialog: Peng!
speaker_heading: OTHERS

dialog: Ni!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER
dialog: Peng!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER
dialog: Sh!
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: (to ARTHUR)
dialog: Therefore, we must give you a test, a Test to satisfy the Knights who
dialog: say Neeeow ... wum ... ping!
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: (terrific chorus)
dialog: Neeeow ... wum ... ping!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What is this test, Knights of N...
dialog: (can't say it)
dialog: ... Recently Knights of Ni!
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Ni!
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: Firstly. You must get us another shrubbery!
speaker_heading: OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: (half seen)
dialog: More shrubberies! More shrubberies for the ex-Knights of Ni!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Not another shrubbery -
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here,
dialog: beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a
text: two-level effect with a path through the middle.
speaker_heading: OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: A path! A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
dialog: Chorus of "Ni! Ni!"
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut
dialog: down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
speaker_heading: OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: Yes! With a herring! With a herring! Cut down with a herring!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: Oh, please!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Cut down a tree with a herring? It can't be done!
speaker_heading: OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: (they all recoil in horror)
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: Don't say that word.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What word?
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: I cannot tell you. Suffice to say is one of the words
dialog: the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: (cringing in fear)
dialog: You said it again!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What, "is"?
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: (dismissively)
dialog: No, no ... not "is"!
speaker_heading: OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: Not "is"! Not "is"!
text: Suddenly singing is heard from deep in the forest.
speaker_heading: SIR ROBIN'S SINGERS
dialog: Bravely good Sir Robin was not at all afraid
dialog: To have his eyeballs skewered ...
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: "Is" is all right ... You wouldn't get far not saying "Is"!
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: My liege, it's Sir Robin!
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: (covering his ears)
dialog: You've said the word again!
text: SIR ROBIN and his SINGERS appear in the clearing. The SINGERS are going on
text: cheerfully as usual and ROBIN walks in front of them, continually
dialog: embarrassed at their presence.
speaker_heading: SINGERS
text: ... and his kidneys burnt and his nipples skewered off ...
text: ROBIN holds his hand up for silence.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Sir Robin!
text: He shakes his hand warmly.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: My liege! It's good to have found you again ...
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: Now he's said the word!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Where are you going good Sir Robin?
speaker_heading: ROBIN'S SINGERS
dialog: (starting up again)
dialog: He was going home ... he was giving up,
dialog: He was throwing in the sponge.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
speaker_heading: (to SINGERS)
dialog: Shut up! No ... er ... no ... I ... er ... I ... er ... I certainly
dialog: wasn't giving up ... I was actually looking for the grail ...
dialog: er thing ... in this forest.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: No ... it lies beyond this forest.
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: Stop saying the word!
speaker_heading: OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: Stop saying the word! The word we cannot hear! The word ...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (losing his patience with the fearful KNIGHTS OF "NI")
dialog: Oh, stop it!
text: Terrific confusion amongst the KNIGHTS OF "NI", they roll on the ground
text: covering their ears. The TALL KNIGHT remains standing trying to control
speaker_heading: his MEN.
speaker_heading: OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: They're all saying the word ...
speaker_heading: TALL KNIGHT
dialog: Stop saying it. AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
speaker_heading: OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: You've said it! Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
text: ARTHUR beckons to BEDEVERE and ROBIN and they pick their way through
text: the helpless KNIGHTS OF "NI" and away into the forest.
scene_heading: 27 EXTERIOR - HISTORIAN'S GLADE - DAY
text: We CUT TO an almost subliminal shot of the HISTORIAN'S WIFE being shown
text: into a police car, which then roars off out of the glade
text: | CUT BACK to the forest. The Knights of "NI" are slowly recovering. they
dialog: | get up.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | TALL KNIGHT
dialog: | Well, At least We've got ONE shrubbery.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: | Yes, Yes ... We've Done very Well ... NI!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | TALL KNIGHT
dialog: | Ssh! I think somebody's coming. We'll get them to give us
dialog: | another shrubbery.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: | Good Idea. More shrubberies. As many as possible.
dialog: |
text: | Perhaps we start to TRACK BACK from the scene as they go on talking.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | TALL KNIGHT
dialog: | What shall we call ourselves this time?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KNIGHT
dialog: | How about "The knights of Nicky-Nicky"?

speaker_heading: |28 EXTERIOR - DAY
dialog: |
text: | A Small group of PEASANTS are being shuffled into a group formation, at the
text: | apparent direction of someone behind the camera. A Few coughs

dialog: | into pleasant (melliflubus) song.
dialog: |
dialog: | Song: When the trees do blossom full
dialog: | and all the hills are green
dialog: | Oh! Oh! We sing
dialog: | hey! hey! We sing
dialog: | our count....ry Song...
dialog: |
text: | A hail of arrow hits them and they crumple up. sound of raucous

dialog: |
text: | CUT TO Reveal a firing squad of ARCHERS kneeling not ten feet away from
dialog: | the group of SINGERS.
dialog: |
text: | Sitting on the throne on a dais is KING BRIAN THE WILD. He is roaring with
text: | roaring with laughter. and his court is slightly shabby - bearing all the
dialog: | marks of a faded richness. it is a court without women, and nobody
dialog: | does the washing or shaves very well. perhaps there is washing however
text: | on the line over the castle. KING BRIAN'S ADVISERS stand around
dialog: | him. Everyone bears the signs of past injuries (Except for BRIAN
dialog: | himself) I.E. they have an arm in a sling or head bandaged; all the people
dialog: | at court, except for BRIAN have their left arm missing (possibly
dialog: | the result of some violent edict a few years back)
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN

dialog: | Oh! Very good! Next!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | FIRST ADVISER
dialog: | (a Little uncomfortably - perhaps his arm is in a sling obviously
dialog: | giving him some pain)
dialog: | There are no more, Sir.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | (grabbing him by the collar)
dialog: | What do'you mean you filthy dog!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | FIRST ADVISER
dialog: | There are no more close harmony groups in the kingdom, Sir.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | No more close harmony groups!!!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | FIRST ADVISER
dialog: | We have scoured the kingdom.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | (lifting him bodily into the air and breaking his
dialog: | arm again slightly)
dialog: | You Miserable worm! you wretch! You Walking son of a dunghill keeper!
dialog: | Guards!
dialog: |
dialog: | Two Rather shabby looking GUARDS approach. (as everyone else they also

dialog: |
speaker_heading: | FIRST ADVISER
dialog: | have mercy your MAJESTY!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | GUARDS! Take him away and suspend him by his nostrils from the highest

dialog: |
dialog: |
speaker_heading: |29 EXTERIOR - DAY
dialog: |
text: | CUT BACK to the glade where the KNIGHTS OF NI! were. A police car
text: | roars up. Two PLAIN CLOTHES DETECTIVE and a CONSTABLE get out, look
text: | around suspiciously, perhaps kneel and examine the ground. one POLICEMAN
text: | finds PATSY's shoe and the other finds a strange scientific instrument that
dialog: | was hanging from BEDEVERE.
dialog: |
text: | They nod grimly to each other. Climb back in the car and drive off.
dialog: |
dialog: |
speaker_heading: |30 EXTERIOR - DAY
dialog: |
text: | Back in KING BRIAN's Court. the FIRST ADVISER has been dragged off. there
text: | are muffled screams coming from the nearby tree. the FIRST ADVISER

speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | Your Majesty, I can Find you a Lute player, whose music is passing
dialog: | sweet.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | It's not the same, You thick-headed fool!
text: | (KING BRIAN hits him on the back of the head. he falls.)
dialog: | There's no fun in killing soloists!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | (picking himself up)
dialog: | He may have a friend...
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | GUARDS!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | Oh Please your majesty! Please!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | Take him away and tie his kidneys to the longest hedge in the kingdom!
dialog: |
text: | The GUARDS drag the ADVISER roughly away.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | No!
dialog: | (he is dragged off screaming and protesting)
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | (roaring at the rest of the court)
dialog: | I will personally disembowel the next little bastard who tells me that
dialog: | there are no more close harmony ...
dialog: |
text: | At this moment we hear faintly the sound of singing. KING BRIAN stopped
text: | to listen. The entire COURT turns thankfully towards the mellifluous
dialog: | sounds.
dialog: |
dialog: | We're the knights of the round table
dialog: | our shows are formidable
dialog: | but many times we're given rhymes
dialog: | that are quite unsingable...
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | Wait a minute! Five point harmony with a counter-tenor lead!
dialog: |
text: | Various members of the COURT sigh and breathe more easily.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | CREEP
dialog: | Thank goodness.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | Shut up!
text: | (punches him right on the end of the nose and shouts to the
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER)
dialog: | Oy you!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | (doubled-up, Surrounded by soldiers busy with his stomach)
dialog: | Yes, Your majesty?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | Go and get 'em!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | (gratefully)

dialog: | in mid-verse?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | I bring greetings from the court of king Brian.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SIR LANCELOT
dialog: | King Brian the wild?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | Some call him that, but he's calmed down allot recently.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SIR GALAHAD
dialog: | Are those YOUR kidneys?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | (covering his stomach)
dialog: | No no... It's nothing - just a flesh wound.
dialog: | (The KNIGHTS look at each other)
dialog: | he has herd your beautiful melody; and wishes you to come to his court,
dialog: | that he may listen at his ease ooh!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SIR LANCELOT
dialog: | You must be joking!
dialog: | (general murmur or agreement from the other KNIGHTS.)
dialog: | Go to the court of king Brian the wild and sing close harmony!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: | No fear etc.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | (in increasing pain)
dialog: | It need not be close harmony oooh agh!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SIR GALAHAD
dialog: | Ah but it would get round to close harmony, wouldn't it?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | Not necessarily ... As I say king Brian is much more relaxed than
dialog: | he used to be.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SIR GALAHAD
dialog: | I mean could we just stick to one line of plainsong with a bit of
dialog: | straight choral work?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | Well obviously he'd prefer a bit of close harmony arghhh!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KNIGHTS
dialog: | Ah! There you are!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SIR LAUNCELOT

dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KNIGHTS
dialog: | Ah! That sounds more like Brian the wild!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | (looking helplessly at his intestines)
dialog: | He ... he ... still gets irritable occasionally.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SIR GALAHAD
dialog: | Like with close harmony groups.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | Ooh ... Look if you're scared ...
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SIR LANCELOT
dialog: | We're not SCARED!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SECOND ADVISER
dialog: | (With his last ounce of strength)
dialog: | Very well! King Brian challenges your to sing before him in close
dialog: | harmony!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | A challenge?
dialog: |
text: | The KNIGHTS look at each other rather taken aback but an idealistic glow
text: | suffuses KING ARTHUR's eyes as he looks heaven-wards. The other KNIGHTS
text: | look at him rather fearfully.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | (majestacally)
dialog: | It is a challenge. We cannot refuse.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | SIR GALAHAD
dialog: | King Brian's a fucking looney.

dialog: | from scene tow (Perhaps we see him being paid off)
dialog: |
text: | SHOT of KING BRIAN on his podium and the HERALD being untied and having
dialog: | his gag removed.
dialog: |
text: | SHOT of ARTHUR and KNIGHTS getting into a group on the podium still
dialog: | rather nervous.

dialog: |
speaker_heading: | KING BRIAN
dialog: | What is it now?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR

dialog: |
text: | CUT TO see SIR ROBIN and his MINSTRELS approaching from round a corner
text: | of the castle. SIR ROBIN walks a few feet in from of the them looking

text: Shots of ARTHUR etc. Riding out of the forest. They leave the forest and
dialog: they meet LAUNCELOT and GALAHAD.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: And so Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to
dialog: find the Enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in scene twenty-four.
dialog: Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much
dialog: rejoicing.
scene_heading: 29 EXTERIOR - ANOTHER LANDSCAPE - DAY - ANIMATION
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat Robin's
dialog: minstrels ... And there was much rejoicing ... A year passed ...
text: MONTAGE of shots of the KNIGHTS.
dialog: Autumn changed into Winter ... Winter changed into Spring ... Spring
dialog: changed back into Autumn and Autumn gave Winter and Spring a miss and
dialog: went straight on into Summer ... Until one day ...
scene_heading: 30 EXTERIOR - WASTES - DAY
text: The KNIGHTS are riding along the top of a ridge. The country is wild and
text: inhospitable. Suddenly some of them see fire in the distance and ride
text: towards it. As they approach they see an impressive WIZARD figure striding
text: around conjuring up fire from the ground and causing various bushes and
text: branches to burst into flame.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint
dialog: or tinder?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I am an enchanter.
text: ARTHUR looks at BEDEVERE.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: By what name are you known?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: There are some who call me Tim?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Greetings King Arthur.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You know my name?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I do.
dialog: (does another fire trick)
dialog: You seek the Holy Grail.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: That is our quest. You know much that is hidden O Tim.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: (does another fire trick)
dialog: Quite.
text: Ripple of applause from the KNIGHTS.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yes we seek the Holy Grail.
dialog: (clears throat very quietly)
dialog: Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
speaker_heading: ONE OR TWO KNIGHTS
dialog: Yes it is.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: And so we're looking for it.
speaker_heading: KNIGHTS
dialog: Yes, we are.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: We have been for some time.
speaker_heading: KNIGHTS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Months.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yes ... and obviously any help we get is ... is very ... helpful.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Do you know where it ...
text: TIM does another fire trick.
speaker_heading: ALL OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: Sssssh!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Fine ... well er ... we mustn't take up anymore of your time ...
dialog: I don't suppose ... sorry to sort of keep on about it ... you
dialog: haven't by any chance ... aaah ... any idea where one might
dialog: find ... a ... aaa ...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: A G...g...g...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: A Grail?
text: They all jump slightly and look about apprehensively.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Er ... yes ... I think so.
speaker_heading: ALL OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KNIGHTS
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Splendid!
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: Yes, marvellous.
text: TIM looks thoughtful and they all stand around a little. Then TIM produces
text: another fire trick producing several different colours.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Look, you're a busy man ...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes, I can help you with your guest.
dialog: Slight pause.
speaker_heading: ALL OTHER KNIGHTS
dialog: Thank you. Yes, thank you very much.
speaker_heading: TIM
text: To the north there lies a cave, the cave of Caerbannog,
text: wherein, carved in mystic runes, upon the very living rock,
dialog: the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged ...
text: There is a thunderclap and a wind starts. They KNIGHTS get nervous.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: ... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Follow!
text: The KNIGHTS register delight and wheel round on themselves.
dialog: But follow only if you are men of valour. For the entrance
dialog: to this cave is guarded by a monster, a creature so foul
dialog: and cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived.
text: Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair ...
dialog: therefore sweet knights if you may doubt your strength or courage
dialog: come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty pointy teeth.

speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + What an eccentric performance!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: 31 EXTERIOR - DAY
text: CUT TO impressive rock face with caves in it. The KNIGHTS are 'riding'
text: towards it. A foreboding atmosphere supervenes. TIM gives a signal for
text: quietness. ARTHUR shushes the 'horses'.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Shhh!
dialog: The PAGES decrease the amount of noise they are making with the coconuts
text: for a few seconds. Then there is a burst of noise from them including
text: whinnying.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
speaker_heading: (to ARTHUR)
dialog: They're nervous, sire.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
text: TIM takes a strange look at them. They walk on leaving the PAGES behind.
text: After a few more strides TIM halts them with a sign.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!
text: CUT TO shot of cave. Bones littered around. The KNIGHTS get the wind
text: up partially. A little dry ice, glowing green can be seen at the
text: entrance. Suddenly we become aware of total silence. Any noises the
text: KNIGHTS make sound very exaggerated. They unsheathe their swords.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Keep me covered.
speaker_heading: Stir among KNIGHTS.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: What with?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Just keep me covered.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Too late.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: There he is!
text: They all turn,, and see a large white RABBIT lollop a few yards out of the
text: cave. Accompanied by terrifying chord and jarring metallic monster noise.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: There.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Behind the rabbit?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: It is the rabbit.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: ... You silly sod.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You got us all worked up.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: You cretin!
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: That is not an ordinary rabbit ... 'tis the most foul cruel
dialog: and bad-tempered thing you ever set eyes on.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You tit. I soiled my armour I was so scared!
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: | Oh, fuck off.
dialog: + Get stuffed.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: He'll do you up a treat mate!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: | You turd!
dialog: + Mangy scots git!
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Look. I'm warning you.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What's he do? Nibble your bum?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a...
dialog: look at the bones.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Go on, Bors, chop its head off.
speaker_heading: BORS
text: Right. Silly little bleeder. One rabbit stew coming up.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Look!
text: As TIM points they all spin round to see the RABBIT leap at BORS'
text: throat with an appalling scream. From a distance of about twenty feet
text: there is a tin opening noise, a cry from BORS. A quick CLOSE-UP
text: of a savage RABBIT biting through tin and BORS' head flies off. The
text: RABBIT leaps back to the mouth of the cave and sits there looking
text: in the KNIGHTS' direction and growling menacingly.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Je...sus Christ!
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I warned you!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I done it again.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Did I tell you? Did you listen to me? Oh no, no, you knew better
dialog: didn't you? No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it. The names you
dialog: called me. Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Oh, shut up.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Charge!
text: They all charge with swords drawn towards the RABBIT. A tremendous twenty
dialog: second fight with Peckinpahish shots and borrowing heavily also on the
text: Kung Fu and karate-type films ensues, in which some four KNIGHTS are
dialog: comprehensively killed.
dialog: Run away! Run away!
speaker_heading: ALL KNIGHTS
dialog: (taking up cry)
dialog: Run away! Run away!
text: They run down from the cave and hide, regrouping behind some rocks. TIM,
text: some way away, is pointing at them and laughing derisively.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Who did we lose?
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Sir Gawain.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Ector.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: And Bors. Five.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + GALAHAD
dialog: + Three, sir!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Three. Well, we'll not risk another frontal
dialog: assault. That rabbit's dynamite.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Would it help to confuse him if we ran away more.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Shut up. Go and change your armour.
text: ROBIN leaves, walking strangely.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Let us taunt it. It may become so cross that it will make
dialog: a mistake.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Like what?
dialog: GALAHAD cannot find a suitable answer to this.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Do we have any bows?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. 'Tis one of the sacred
dialog: relics Brother Maynard always carries with him.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Yes. Of course.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!
text: Slight pause. Then from the area where the 'HORSES' are, a small group
text: of MONKS process forward towards the KNIGHTS, the leading MONK bearing
text: and ornate golden reliquary, and the accompanying MONKS chanting and
text: waving incense. They reach the KNIGHTS. The hand grenade is suffused
dialog: with the holy glow.
dialog: ARTHUR takes it. Pause
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: How does it ... er ...
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: I know not.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Consult the Book of Armaments.
speaker_heading: BROTHER MAYNARD
dialog: Armaments Chapter Two Verses Nine to Twenty One.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER MONK
dialog: (reading from bible)
text: And St. Attila raised his hand grenade up on high saying
dialog: "O Lord bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow
dialog: thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy. "and the Lord did grin and
dialog: people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies
dialog: and orang-utans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and...
speaker_heading: BROTHER MAYNARD
dialog: Skip a bit brother ...
speaker_heading: ANOTHER MONK
dialog: ... Er ... oh, yes ... and the Lord spake, saying, "First shalt thou
dialog: take out the Holy Pin, then shalt thou count to three, no more,
dialog: no less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the
dialog: number of the counting shalt be three. Four shalt thou not count,
dialog: neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.
text: Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number,
dialog: be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch
dialog: towards thou foe, who being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Right.
text: He pulls Pin out. The MONK blesses the grenade as ...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: One, two
dialog: | , three ...
dialog: + , five ...
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + GALAHAD
dialog: + Three, sir!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + Three.
dialog: +
text: ARTHUR throws the grenade at the RABBIT. There is an explosion and cheering
speaker_heading: from the KNIGHTS.
speaker_heading: ALL KNIGHTS
dialog: Praise be to the lord. Huzzah!
scene_heading: 32 INTERIOR - CAVE - DAY
text: MIX THROUGH TO the KNIGHTS entering the cave. It is a large cave and as
text: they walk inside it we see in the darkness at the side of the cave
text: a fearsome looking CREATURE which watches them with some surprise
text: as they walk to some writing carved on the back of the cave wall.
text: The KNIGHTS are accompanied by BROTHER MAYNARD.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: There! Look!
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: What does it say?
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: What language is this?
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Brother Maynard, you are a scholar.
speaker_heading: BROTHER MAYNARD
dialog: It is Aramaic!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Of course. Joseph of Aramathea!
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What does it say?
speaker_heading: BROTHER MAYNARD
dialog: It reads ... "Here may be found the last words of Joseph of
dialog: Aramathea."
dialog: Excitement.
dialog: "He who is valorous and pure of heart may find the Holy Grail
dialog: in the aaaaarrrrrrggghhh..."
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BROTHER MAYNARD
dialog: "The Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh..."
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: BROTHER MAYNARD
dialog: He must have died while carving it.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Oh, come on.
speaker_heading: BROTHER MAYNARD
dialog: That's what it says.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (miming)
dialog: But if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".
dialog: He'd just say it.
speaker_heading: BROTHER MAYNARD
text: It's down there carved in stone.
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Perhaps he was dictating.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Shut up. Is that all it says?
speaker_heading: BROTHER MAYNARD
dialog: That's all. "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh".
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Do you think he meant the Camargue?
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: Where's that?
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: France, I think.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Isn't there a St. Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh's in Cornwall?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: No, that's Saint Ives.
text: A muffled roar is heard.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ROBIN
dialog: | Hey!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | BEDEVERE
dialog: | No, that's in Herefordshire.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ROBIN
dialog: | (more urgently)
dialog: | No ... HEY!!!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | LAUNCELOT
dialog: | "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... "
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ROBIN
dialog: | No! "Hey"! is surprise and alarm!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + BEDEVERE
dialog: + Oooooh!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + LAUNCELOT
dialog: + No "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ... " at the back of the throat.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + BEDEVERE
dialog: + No! "Oooooh!" in surprise and alarm!
dialog: +
text: He indicated the entrance of the cave. They all turn and look. There in
text: the opening is a huge, unpleasant, fairly well drawn cartoon beast.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: GALAHAD
dialog: My God!
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: I know! I know! I Know!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: It's the ... oh ...
dialog: (snaps his fingers as he tries to remember)
dialog: it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
dialog: Another hideous roar.
dialog: That's it!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!
dialog: |
text: | At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION. ARTHUR turns.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | Who was that?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | HECTOR
dialog: | (from back of group; northern and helpful)
dialog: | It was Sir Alf.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | I didn't know we had a Sir Alf.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | HECTOR
dialog: | He was feeding it bread.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | (shouting back)
dialog: | Well, that was a very silly thing to do. Now the rest of you stand
dialog: | well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | HECTOR
dialog: | Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ROBIN
dialog: | Look out.
dialog: |
text: | The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them. The KNIGHTS retreat
dialog: | into the darkness of the cave.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | GAWAIN
dialog: | (as they run)
dialog: | It's only a cartoon.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | Sh!
text: They run off. Darkness. The MONSTER lumbering through on animation.
speaker_heading: + VOICE OVER
text: + As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape for Arthur
dialog: + and his knights seemed hopeless, when, suddenly ... the animator
dialog: + suffered a fatal heart attack.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ANIMATOR
dialog: + Aaaaagh!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + VOICE OVER
dialog: + The cartoon peril was no more ... The Quest for Holy Grail
dialog: + could continue.
text: ANIMATED SEQUENCE. Leads through to the group reappearing and seeing a
text: distant opening to the cave. They reach the opening. It is day.
speaker_heading: 33 EXTERIOR - DAY
text: The KNIGHTS emerge from the mouth of the cave to find themselves in a
text: breathtaking, barren landscape. Glencoe. They are half they way up
text: the side of a mountain. They rest a few seconds and get their breath
dialog: back.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | GALAHAD
dialog: | Look!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: + GALAHAD
dialog: + There it is!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + The Bridge of Death!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ROBIN
dialog: + (to himself)
dialog: + Oh! Great ...
dialog: |
dialog: | They look and see on the side of the mountain there is a sort of milestone
dialog: | which bears the words: "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! 5 miles" and an arrow.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | God be praised. This must be the gorge of which the old man spoke
dialog: | in scene twenty-four.
dialog: |
text: | The KNIGHTS set off along and rather perilous track edging along
text: | the side of the mountain. GALAHAD is leading.
dialog: |
text: | MIX THROUGH they are climbing higher. The path gets more and more
dialog: | slippery and dangerous. They reach another milestone which says:
dialog: | "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! 4 miles" and an arrow, and "Ni! 82 miles" and
text: | an arrow pointing in the opposite direction. They go on. It is
dialog: | dangerous and difficult. Tension in their faces.
dialog: |
text: | As they are climbing, BEDEVERE turns to ROBIN and ARTHUR.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | BEDEVERE
dialog: | We must find the bridge ... the Bridge of Death ...
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ROBIN
dialog: | (to himself)
dialog: | Oh, great!
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | BEDEVERE
text: | The Bridge is guarded by a bridgekeeper, who asks each traveller
dialog: | three questions. And he who answers the three questions can
dialog: | cross in safety.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ROBIN
dialog: | (warily)
dialog: | And if you get a question wrong?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | BEDEVERE
dialog: | You are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: |34 EXTERIOR - DAY
dialog: |
text: | CUT TO them struggling along. Perhaps downhill now. It is growing misty.
text: | SIR LAUNCELOT stops them and points. They peer.
dialog: |
text: | CUT TO see in the mist ... a weird bridge with mist swirling up from the
dialog: | gorge below. We cannot see the other side.
dialog: |
dialog: | Beside the bridge an OLD MAN stands, he is the blind soothsayer they
dialog: | met earlier in the forest.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
speaker_heading: | (to BEDEVERE)
dialog: | He's the Keeper of the Bridge. It's the old man.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | BEDEVERE
dialog: | (swallowing hard)
dialog: | Who's going to answer the questions?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | You go, Robin, and God be with you.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ROBIN
dialog: | (looking round wildly)
dialog: | Er ... I tell you what -
dialog: | (lowering voice)
dialog: | Why doesn't Launcelot go?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | (considering a moment)
dialog: | Very well ... Sir Launcelot. Brave Sir Launcelot. This is the Bridge
dialog: | of Death ...
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | LAUNCELOT
dialog: | Oh, yes sir ... I will take it single-handed.
dialog: | (drawing his sword)
dialog: | I will ...
dialog: |
dialog: | ARTHUR restrains him.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | No, hang on. All we want is for you to approach the old man
dialog: | and he will ask you three questions. Answer those question as
dialog: | best you can, and we will watch ... and pray.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | LAUNCELOT
dialog: | Yes, my liege ...
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot! Be careful ...
dialog: |
text: | They shake hands, Arthur's eyes moisten. LAUNCELOT approaches the
dialog: | Bridge of Death.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | Listen to the questions.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + BEDEVERE
dialog: + Look! It's the old man from scene 24 - what's he Doing here?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + He is the keeper of the Bridge. He asks each traveler five questions ...+
speaker_heading: + GALAHAD
dialog: + Three questions.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + Three questions ... he who answers the five questions
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + GALAHAD
dialog: + Three questions.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + Three questions, may cross in safety.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ROBIN
dialog: + (warily)
dialog: + And if you get a question wrong?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + You are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ROBIN
dialog: + Oh ... wacho!
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + GALAHAD
dialog: + Who's going to answer the questions?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + Sir Robin, Brave Sir Robin you go.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ROBIN
dialog: + Hey! I've got a great idea!
dialog: + Why doesn't Launcelot go?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + LAUNCELOT
dialog: + Yes. Let me. I will take it single-handed ...
dialog: + I will make feint to the north-east ...
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + No, hang on! Just answer the five questions ...
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + GALAHAD
dialog: + Three questions ...
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + Three questions ... And we shall watch ... and pray.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + LAUNCELOT
dialog: + I understand, my liege.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot ... God be with you.
dialog: +
text: + LAUNCELOT APPROACHES THE BRIDGEKEEPER.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: Stop!
text: SIR LAUNCELOT stops. The KNIGHTS watch anxiously. ARTHUR sniffs briefly
text: and glances momentarily down at SIR ROBIN's lower armour.
speaker_heading: BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: Who approaches the Bridge of Death
dialog: Must answer me
dialog: These questions three!
dialog: Ere the other side he see.
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I am not afraid.
speaker_heading: BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: What is your name?
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: My name is Sir Launcelot.
speaker_heading: BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: What is your quest?
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: To find the Holy Grail.
speaker_heading: BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: What is your favorite colour?
speaker_heading: LAUNCELOT
dialog: Blue.
speaker_heading: BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: Right. Off you go.
text: SIR LAUNCELOT runs across into the mist. The bridge perhaps disappears
text: into the mist and we cannot see the other side. ARTHUR and SIR ROBIN
text: exchange glances. ROBIN breathes a great sigh of relief.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: That's easy!
speaker_heading: BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: Stop!
dialog: Who approacheth the Bridge of Death
dialog: Must answer me
dialog: These questions three!
dialog: Ere the other side he see!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I am not afraid.
speaker_heading: BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: What is your name?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
speaker_heading: BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: What is your quest?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: To seek the Grail!
speaker_heading: BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: What is the capital of Assyria?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: I don't know that!
text: He is immediately hurled by some unseen force over the edge of the
dialog: precipice.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!
speaker_heading: 35 EXTERIOR - DAY
text: CUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT who is only just arriving on the other side. He looks
text: back across the invisible chasm. Dimly in the distance he hears:
speaker_heading: GAWAIN (OUT OF VISION)
dialog: Sir Gawain of Camelot!
speaker_heading: BRIDGEKEEPER (OOV)
dialog: What is your quest?
speaker_heading: GAWAIN (OOV)
dialog: To seek the Holy Grail.

dialog: |
text: | SIR LAUNCELOT stands on the other side of the bridge. In the
text: | distance we hear the ritual of questions and then a scream and thud,
text: | suddenly a hand lands on LAUNCELOT's shoulder.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | POLICEMAN (VOICE OVER)
dialog: | Just want to ask you some questions, sir.
dialog: |
text: | LAUNCELOT turns and reacts. He is led away.

dialog: |
text: | CUT TO ARTHUR, GALAHAD and BEDEVERE struggling towards the lake.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | BEDEVERE
speaker_heading: | (to ARTHUR)
dialog: | How did you know how many wing-beats a swallow needs to
dialog: | maintain velocity?
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | ARTHUR
dialog: | Oh ... when you're king you know all those things.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: + What is your favorite colour?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + GAWAIN
dialog: + Blue ... No yelloooooww!
dialog: +
text: + ARTHUR and BEDEVERE step forward.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: + What is your name?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + It is Arthur, King of the Britons.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: + What is your quest?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + To seek the Holy Grail.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: + What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + What do you mean? An African or European swallow?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: + Er ... I don't know that ... Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh!
dialog: +
text: + BRIDGEKEEPER is cast into the gorge.
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + BEDEVERE
dialog: + How do you know so much about swollows?
dialog: +
speaker_heading: + ARTHUR
dialog: + Well you have to know these things when you're a king, you know.
dialog: +
text: Suddenly they appear at water's edge. They look across the water. A huge
dialog: expanse disappearing into the mist. How can they cross?
text: Suddenly the air is filled with ethereal music, and out of the mist
text: appears a wonderful barge silently and slowly drifting towards them.
text: They gaze in wonder. The mysterious boat comes to where they are standing.
text: As if bewitched, they find themselves drawing closer
text: | to the boat. As they are about to step in, a ragged figure looks
dialog: | up at them.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | BOATKEEPER
dialog: | (he is the same as the BRIDGEKEEPER and the SOOTHSAYER)
dialog: | He who would cross the Sea if Fate
dialog: | must answer me
dialog: | these questions twenty-eight.
dialog: |
text: | He fixes them with a baleful eye, ARTHUR and BEDEVERE exchange glances,
text: | then turn, with minds made up, pick him up bodily and throw him in the
text: | water. They climb into the boat and the boat moves off into the mist
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | FADE OUT

dialog: |
text: | A wondrous journey in animation carries them across the lake.

speaker_heading: 38 EXTERIOR - DAY
text: The boat carries them across a magical lake. They land and get out of
text: the boat, their faces suffused with heavenly radiance, and fall to their
dialog: knees.
dialog: Crescendo on music.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: God be praised! The deaths of many find knights have this day
dialog: been avenged.
text: Music swells. They bend their heads in prayer, before the castle for
text: which they have searched for so long. Suddenly a voice comes from
dialog: the battlements.
dialog: Music cuts dead.
speaker_heading: FROG
dialog: Ha ha! Hello! Smelly English K...niggets ... and Monsieur Arthur
dialog: King, who has the brain of a duck, you know.
speaker_heading: The KNIGHTS look up.
speaker_heading: FROG
dialog: We French persons outwit you a second time, perfidious English
dialog: mousedropping hoarders ... how you say: "Begorrah!"
text: ARTHUR stands and shouts.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: How dare you profane this place with your presence! I command
dialog: you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot, open the door to the
dialog: Sacred Castle, to which God himself has guided us!
dialog: (he turns to the KNIGHTS)
dialog: Come.
text: ARTHUR and the KNIGHTS advance towards the castle.
speaker_heading: FROG
dialog: How you English say: I one more time, mac, I unclog my nose towards you,
dialog: sons of a window-dresser, so, you think you could out-clever us French
dialog: fellows with your silly knees-bent creeping about advancing
dialog: behaviour.
dialog: (blows a raspberry)
dialog: I wave my private parts at your aunties, you brightly-coloured,
text: mealy-templed, cranberry-smelling, electric donkey-bottom biters.
text: By this time ARTHUR and BEDEVERE and GALAHAD have reached the door.
text: ARTHUR bangs on the door.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred
dialog: castle.
dialog: Jeering from the battlements.
speaker_heading: FROG
dialog: No chance, English bed-wetting types. We burst our pimples at you,
dialog: and call your door-opening request a silly thing. You tiny-brained
dialog: wipers of other people's bottoms!
dialog: French laughter
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: If you do not open these doors, we will take this castle by force ...
text: A bucket of slops land on ARTHUR. He tries to retain his dignity.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: In the name of God ... and the glory of our ...
text: Another bucket of what can only be described as human ordure hits ARTHUR.
dialog: ... Right!
speaker_heading: (to the KNIGHTS)
dialog: That settles it!
text: They turn and walk away. French jeering follows them.
speaker_heading: FROG
dialog: Yes, depart a lot at this time, and cut the approaching any more or
dialog: we fire arrows into the tops of your heads and make castanets
dialog: of your testicles already.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
speaker_heading: (to KNIGHTS)
dialog: Walk away. Just ignore them.
text: ARTHUR, BEDEVERE and GALAHAD walk off. A small hail of chickens,
text: watercress, badgers and mattresses follows them. But they are on their
text: dignity as they try to talk nonchalantly as they walk away into the trees.
speaker_heading: FROG
dialog: And now remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk! And, if you think
dialog: you got a nasty time this taunting, you ain't heard nothing yet, dappy
dialog: k...niggets, and A. King Esquire.
text: | CUT BACK TO the drenched BRIDGEKEEPER/SOOTHSAYER beside the lake He
dialog: | rises up into SHOT.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | BRIDGEKEEPER
dialog: | He would cross the sea of fate,
dialog: | Must answer me these questions
dialog: | Twenty-eight.
dialog: |
text: | CUT TO see he is talking to two PLAIN-CLOTHES POLICEMEN and two
speaker_heading: | CONSTABLES.
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | INSPECTOR
dialog: | All right, put him in the van.
dialog: |
text: | THE BRIDGEKEEPER is led away and put into a police van.
dialog: |
text: CUT BACK TO ARTHUR still walking away. French taunts still audible in
dialog: the distance.
speaker_heading: FRENCH
dialog: You couldn't catch clap in a brothel, silly English K...niggets ...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
speaker_heading: (to BEDEVERE)
dialog: We shall attack at once.
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Yes, my liege.
dialog: (he turns)
dialog: Stand by for attack!!
text: CUT TO enormous army forming up. Trebuchets, rows of PIKEMEN, siege
text: towers, pennants flying, shouts of "Stand by for attack!" Traditional
text: army build-up shots. The shouts echo across the ranks of the army.
text: We see various groups reacting, and stirring themselves in readiness.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Who are they?
speaker_heading: BEDEVERE
dialog: Oh, just some friends!
text: We end up back with ARTHUR. He seems satisfied that the ARMY is ready.
text: PANNING down the serried ranks, pikes ready, pennants flapping in the
text: wind. Some of the horses whinny nervously, and rattle their coconuts.
text: ARTHUR is satisfied at last. He addresses the castle.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: French persons! Today the blood of many valiant knights shall
dialog: bee avenged. In the name of God, we shall not stop our fight
dialog: until each one of you lies dead and the Grail returns to those
dialog: whom God has chosen.
text: ARTHUR lowers his visor, turns to have a last look at ARMY, then:
speaker_heading: CHARGE!
text: The mighty ARMY charges. Thundering noise of feet. Clatter of coconuts.
dialog: Shouts etc.
dialog: The charge towards the castle.
text: Suddenly there is a wail of a siren and a couple of police cars roar
text: round in front of the charging ARMY and the POLICE leap out and stop
text: them. TWO POLICEMAN and the HISTORIAN'S WIFE. Black Marias skid up
dialog: behind them.
text: The ARMY halts.
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN'S WIFE
dialog: They're the ones, I'm sure.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR END OF FILM
dialog: Grab 'em!
text: The POLICE grab ARTHUR and bundle him into the maria.
text: SIR BEDEVERE is led off with a blanket over his head. They are bundled
text: into the black maria and the van drives off.
text: The rest of the ARMY stand around looking at a loss.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR END OF FILM
dialog: (picks up megaphone)
dialog: All right! Clear off! Go on!
text: A few reaction shots of the ARMY not quite sure what to do.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR END OF FILM
dialog: Move along. There's nothing to see! Keep moving!
text: Suddenly he notices the cameras.
text: As the black maria drives away QUICK SHOT through window of all the
speaker_heading: KNIGHTS huddled inside.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR END OF FILM
dialog: (to Camera)
dialog: All right, put that away sonny.
text: He walks over to it and puts his hand over the lens.
text: The film runs out through the gate and the projector shines on the
dialog: screen.
text: There is a blank screen for some fifteen seconds.
dialog: |
text: | Suddenly jazzy music. Animated titles. (A new film completely free
dialog: | with the Monty Python film.)
dialog: |
dialog: |
dialog: | "THE CREDITS"
dialog: |
dialog: | Four of five minute film (mainly animated) about the credits, i.e it
dialog: | includes the actual credits for the film but is really elaborate.
dialog: |
dialog: |
speaker_heading: | THE END
dialog: |
dialog: +
text: + Slushy organ music starts and the houselights in the cinema come on ...
text: + organ music continues as the audience leave.

dialog: Dear Mike,
dialog: The Censor's representative, Tony Kerpel, came along to Friday's
dialog: screening at Twinkenham and he gave up his opinion of the film's
dialog: probale certificate.
dialog: He thinks the film will be AA, but it would be possible, given
dialog: some dialogue cuts, to make the film an A rating, which would
dialog: increase the audience. (AA is 14 and over, and A is 5-14).
dialog: For an 'A' we would have to:
dialog: Lose as may shits as possible
dialog: Take Jesus Christ out, if possible
dialog: Loose "I fart in your general direction"
dialog: Lose "the oral sex"
dialog: Lose "oh, fuck off"
dialog: Lose "We make castanets out of your testicles"
dialog: I would like to get back to the Censor and agree to lose the
dialog: shits, take the odd Jesus Christ out and lose Oh fuck off, but
dialog: to retain 'fart in your general direction', 'castanets of your
dialog: testicles' and 'oral sex' and ask him for an 'A' rating on
dialog: that basis.
dialog: Please let me know as soon as possible your attitude to this.
dialog: Yours sincerely,
