scene_heading: FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
text: IN A SMALL TOWN TO THE NORTH OF BOGOTA, COLOMBIA...
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE, BEHIND A SMALL BUILDING — DAY
text: The landscape is a poor neighborhood of narrow, unpaved roads
text: etched into the side of a hill overlooking a small Colombian
text: town. The buildings are all low - one and two-story — made
text: of poured concrete and cinder-block with lines of laundry
text: stretching from one to the other.
text: In back of a building, MARIA, 17 with black wavy hair and
text: dark eyes, is making out with JUAN, 19 and skinny as a rail.
text: Their lips are absolutely locked.
text: Juan puts one hand behind her waist and presses her up
text: against the wall. As he moves from kissing her lips to her
text: cheek, Maria opens her eyes - looking rather unenthusiastic.
text: Juan buries his face in her neck, but Maria is staring up at
text: the pattern of a TV aerial at the top of the building.
scene_heading: (NOTE: ALL DIALOGUE IS IN SPANISH)
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Let's go to your house.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I don’t want to go to my house.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Where do you want to go then?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I don't know. Someplace else.
text: Maria gazes up at the top of the building and smiles.
speaker_heading: MARIA (CONT'D)
dialog: How about up there?
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: On the roof? Why do you wanna go up
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Why not? ... Come on. It’s not that
dialog: high.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: What are you crazy?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (fixes him)
dialog: See how you treat me? You’re a drag.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Let’s not get started with this, OK?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: If I go up there will you follow me?
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: (reticent)
dialog: If I go, are we gonna do it up there?
text: Maria smiles. She turns and takes a good look at the back of
text: the building. She puts her foot on a rock and pulls herself
text: up to a first-floor window-sill. She finds a small ledge and
text: continues to scale up.
text: Juan looks sure she won’t make it up. Maria concentrates on
text: what she's doing - never looking down.
text: She pulls herself up to a second-floor window, but then gets
text: stuck about six feet below the roof.
speaker_heading: JUAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come down. We’ll go to your place.
text: Maria places her foot on a very small protrusion and pushes
text: up - she SLIPS but grabs the edge of the roof just in time
text: and pulls herself up. Juan stares up in disbelief.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (smiles, looking down)
dialog: Come on. Your turn.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Come up - I have something to tell you.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Come down.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: No.
text: Beat. Juan looks around, at a loss for what to do.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: You know what then, I’m taking off.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Then go. I'm not coming down.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Fine. You can come down the same way you
dialog: went up - alone. I’11 see ya.
text: Juan starts to walk away down the hill.
text: Maria watches him go, down toward a small, isolated town
text: ringed by mountains.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM — BEFORE DAWN
text: In a small bedroom with lime-green walls and two single beds,
text: Maria lies ASLEEP with her walkman next to her pillow. On
text: the wall above her are torn-out magazine pictures of various
text: teen idols, salsa stars, and a pink cartoon teddy-bear.
text: Maria’s mother JUANA calls from the other room,
speaker_heading: JUANA (0S)
dialog: Maria. Get up.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM — BEFORE DAWN
text: A precarious electric water-heating element mounted on the
text: shower-head, with wires sticking out of it, shifts into the
text: On position. Maria puts her head fully under the water.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN / MAIN ROOM — BEFORE DAWN
text: PACHO, one year old, is CRYING on his back on a tattered
text: couch in the main room of the small house. Maria’s sister
text: DIANA, 19, stands over him, pressing down on his stomach.
text: ROSITA, Maria’s grandmother, moves to and from the cramped
text: kitchen setting out cups of hot chocolate and rolls. JUANA,
text: 40, is already dressed and folding laundry.
speaker_heading: DIANA
text: His stomach is hard. I’m really worried.
text: Maria comes in combing her hair.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: He hasn’t shit in like two days. He’s
text: really constipated.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Whatever. He’ll go when he goes. Don’t
dialog: worry about it.
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: Maria, don’t brush your hair in the
dialog: dining room please.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: He’s cranky because he’s got someone
text: kneading his stomach like a ball of
dialog: dough.
dialog: (tickling Pacho)
dialog: Isn’t that right? Huh? Isn’t that
dialog: right?
text: Maria picks Pacho up and holds him over her head.
text: him and catches him.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (taking him back)
dialog: You're scaring him.
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: Give him to me.
speaker_heading: ROSITA
dialog: (setting down hot chocolate)
dialog: Maria, sit.
text: Juana takes the baby and gives Diana a blanket.
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: Mama, will you fix a tea for him?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Those teas aren’t gonna do anything for
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ROSITA
dialog: Take him to the doctor this afternoon.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: No Grandma, I don’t trust that guy.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (gets up)
dialog: She throws
text: He doesn’t need to go to the doctor. The
dialog: kid is fine.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Maria goes into the kitchen and opens the fridge.
speaker_heading: ROSITA
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I don’t know. I don’t feel like bread.
dialog: I want something else.
text: Maria cuts a piece of pork sausage for herself.
speaker_heading: ROSITA
dialog: That's your breakfast?
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD — DARK MORNING
text: Maria, Juana and Diana walk along a dark, dusty road before
text: dawn. The only light comes from the windows of other houses
text: they pass.
text: They turn onto a PAVED STREET and stop at an arbitrary spot
text: on the sidewalk and wait with several other people. There’s
text: a minimum of ambient morning light; it’s cold, people huddle.
text: A creaky, old SCHOOL BUS lumbers up and everyone files on -
text: except for Maria. Juana kisses Maria’s cheek and gets on.
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: See you later, honey.
text: The bus pulls away and Maria continues to wait.
scene_heading: INT. MOVING BUS (ANOTHER) — VERY EARLY MORNING
text: Maria sits by the window with BLANCA, also 17 but heavier-set
text: than Maria. The bus lurches along. The seats are full of
text: other people (mostly women), but there is no conversation -
text: only the sound of the driver's tinny radio.
text: Blanca has her head on Maria’s shoulder. Maria stares out at
text: the passing farmland and cows.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANTATION GATEHOUSE — LATER
text: Maria and Blanca get off the bus and merge into a small sea
text: of people who funnel through a tall steel gate past a
text: uniformed guard with steel-toed boots and a shotgun. On the
text: other side, the grounds are landscaped and spotless.
scene_heading: INT. CHANGING ROOMS — CONTINUOUS
text: Maria, Blanca and about two dozen other women put on blue
text: jumpsuits over their clothes, along with thick, rubber boots.
scene_heading: INT. EATING ROOM — CONTINUOUS
text: In a large room with long wooden tables and benches, about a
text: hundred workers eat breakfast. There is a din of
text: conversation. At one table, Blanca eats a roll as Maria
text: interrogates her.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: So did you meet him?
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: I waited by the plaza but he never came.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Are you kidding? He didn't show up?
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: Well it wasn't a real date. He said he
dialog: might be there.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: How long did you wait?
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: Don't laugh.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I'm not laughing. How long did you wait?
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: It doesn't matter. He wasn’t really my
dialog: type... Anyway... You see that guy over
dialog: there?
text: They both turn and look at a GUY in a green jumpsuit sitting
text: two tables away. He makes eye contact with Blanca and SMILES.
speaker_heading: BLANCA (CONT'D)
text: He smiles at me like all the time.
text: The two of them GIGGLE uncontrollably.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM — LATER
text: Maria stands at the basin of the plantation bathroom. She
text: splashes water on her face and rinses her mouth.
scene_heading: INT. FLOWER PLANTATION — LATER
text: In a vast greenhouse, rows and rows of tall pink-rose plants
text: extend into the distance. A space-man wearing a thick rubber
text: suit, a rubber face mask and a rubber head-covering walks
text: through spraying a fine mist of chemical fumigants onto the
text: flowers. Elsewhere in the same greenhouse women clip roses.
text: This is a high-volume flower plantation. MARIA works in the
text: warehouse — an immense hangar with a high roof and about
text: eighty workers all in blue jumpsuits. There are flowers
text: everywhere - bundles of reds, yellows, oranges, and violets.
text: The whole place is a hive of activity: some workers guide
text: large carts on a rail-system into the warehouse; some measure
dialog: and classify the roses into bundles; some place the bundles
text: in large boxes for shipment abroad. It is a tightly
dialog: regimented operation.
text: Maria wears thick rubber gloves and stands in front of a
text: splintering plywood board. Next to her is a huge bunch of
text: 100 red roses. One by one, she takes the roses, examines the
text: quality of the buds, measures the length, and then with a
text: quick, violent jerk she pulls them over an open blade to
text: strip off the thorns. It's a tedious, repetitive action.
text: She is one in a line of twenty people doing the same work.
text: She catches a thorn in her thumb and stops to examine it
text: through the hole in the tip of her glove. Her skin is dotted
text: with thorn scars. She’s sweating profusely and she wipes her
text: forehead with her sleeve.
text: A SUPERVISOR walks from station to station tallying each
text: worker's output on a clipboard.
text: In another aisle, about twenty feet away, Blanca has the job
text: of bundling roses. She sets down corrugated paper and then
text: one by one carefully arranges and wraps the flowers, staples
text: the bundle shut and labels it - then starts all over again.
text: Maria stares at the supervisor, who is now several stations
text: up. She has paused in her work again and is watching
text: everything else in the room with a removed, critical stare.
text: She continues to perspire and looks physically ill. She
text: raises her hand, trying to get her supervisor’s attention.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: As the supervisor happens to look up he sees Maria's hand in
text: the air, sighs and makes his way back to her.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Can I go to the bathroom?
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Again?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I don't feel well.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: You've already been twice this morning.
dialog: You're under by four bins this hour,
dialog: three last hour. How are you going to
dialog: catch up if you keep going to the
dialog: bathroom?
text: He stares at her expectantly.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Please. I'll be quick.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Do you know what it's like for me always
dialog: having to look over your shoulder, Maria?
dialog: You think it's fun for me? I have eighty-
dialog: four workers in this section and everyone
text: else puts their head down and does their
dialog: job. But with you, it's like this
dialog: constant game of tug-of-war just to get
dialog: you to make quota. At this point, I...
text: All of the sudden Maria VOMITS directly on the flowers,
text: splattering her supervisor slightly.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell is wrong with you?! This
dialog: is disgusting. Look at this. What the
dialog: hell?
text: Maria doesn’t dare look up at him.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at these flowers. What are you
dialog: gonna do about these? Huh? What are you
dialog: gonna do?
text: She just stares at the flowers blankly.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR (CONT'D)
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Pick those up.
text: Maria scoops up the bundle of flowers in her arms - vomit and
text: all. With Blanca and the rest watching, the supervisor leads
text: her over to a large BASIN.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Set them there.
text: Maria sets the flowers on a cart. He picks up a HOSE with a
text: spray nozzle and twists it until it shoots a fine mist.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR (cont'd)
dialog: (passing her the hose)
dialog: Wash them off.
text: Maria picks up a rose and sprays it off.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Be careful with the bud.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: But they're already ruined.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: I don’t care. Wash them.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I need to go to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: (really pissed)
dialog: You want to go to the bathroom, then you
dialog: can go on your lunch break... Or you can
dialog: go right now and keep walking out the
dialog: door.
dialog: (he stares her down)
dialog: I want all these flowers clean. And when
dialog: you're done, you’re gonna go back to your
dialog: station and make up the bins you owe me.
dialog: Understood?
text: The supervisor marches off, leaving Maria there - fuming.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN, STREETS — DAY
text: Maria sits on a park bench and picks at her lunch, as a group
text: of kids her age, dressed in school uniforms, passes by. She
text: makes eye contact with one but they move on past. She checks
dialog: the time.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET — AFTERNOON
text: In town. Maria walks up the street.
speaker_heading: JUANA (0S)
dialog: Maria!
text: Maria sees her mother at a small store buying fruits and
text: vegetables. She crosses over to her.
text: Juana pays for the two bags of groceries and puts a few coins
text: of change in her pocket. She picks up the bags and the two
text: of them walk on in silence.
scene_heading: INT. PHARMACY — CONTINUOUS
text: It’s a small place with the drugs on the wall behind the
text: counter. Diana watches as a WOMAN removes foil-wrapped
text: TABLETS from a box and counts them out. Juana enters,
text: trailed by Maria.
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: Is everything OK?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: It’s 9,600. Do you have any money?
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: (to Maria)
dialog: Lend your sister the money.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Why do I have to pay for it?
speaker_heading: DIANA
text: It’s for Pacho. He started vomiting.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: So? Where’s your money?
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: Maria!
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I give up practically all of what I make
text: and Diana doesn’t put in any of hers.
dialog: And now I’m supposed to pay for Pacho’s
dialog: medicine too?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: Maria don’t start! Give your sister the
dialog: money.
text: Juana glares at her daughter. Maria finally digs into her
text: pocket and hands over the money.
speaker_heading: JUANA (cont'd)
dialog: You can keep the extra nine-thousand six-
dialog: hundred when you get paid at the end of
dialog: the month. I don’t know why everything
dialog: always has to be so difficult with you.
text: Maria watches Diana pay. And then, as if trying to get back
dialog: at them, she says,
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Well, there’s not going to be a next
dialog: paycheck... Because I quit.
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: What? When?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Today.
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: They wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: At all?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: It’s not just that. I don’t like the way
dialog: they treat me. So I quit.
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: What are you going to do?
text: The woman behind the counter looks very uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: You're really fucking stupid.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Why don’t you shut up.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Don’t tell me to shut up!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: With that,
dialog: 12.
dialog: (2)
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You don’t know how they treated me.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: You could have put up with it. You’re an
dialog: idiot...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Why do I have to put up with it? Why am
dialog: I always the one to put up with it all?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: ...Why don’t you think of the family for
dialog: once.
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: Enough! Quiet, both of you!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maria, you have to go back and ask for
dialog: your job back.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: No. I’m not going back.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Then what are you going to do?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I’1l find something else.
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: There’s nothing but flowers around here.
dialog: At least it’s a decent job.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Oh please, what’s decent about it?
speaker_heading: JUANA
dialog: Maria! You have to go back!
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Didn't you hear me? I’m not going
dialog: back... I’m not!
text: Maria storms out of the pharmacy and leaves them
text: standing there.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA — EARLY EVENING
text: Maria sits by the plaza fountain with Juan and Blanca and a
text: group of about five other girls and guys crowded around.
text: Juan's got a BOTTLE of aguardiente and everyone is laughing,
text: except Maria, who hasn’t shaken her bad mood.
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You should have seen the look on the
text: supervisor’s face... He was completely
dialog: covered in it...
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: This deserves a toast.
text: Juan pours a shot for Maria in a little plastic cup.
speaker_heading: JUAN (CONT'D)
dialog: To Maria! Because she kicks ass!
text: She sips it, winces and then swallows the rest in one gulp.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OUTDOOR FIESTA — NIGHT
text: A small rocket whizzes into the air and EXPLODES. On a side-
text: street off the plaza, there’s a small fiesta going on - with
text: a little band of a dozen local guys (in uniform) playing a
text: slightly sloppy, but very energetic salsa - and a crowd of
text: about forty people of all ages - some dancing, some watching.
text: Maria and Blanca dance up a storm together - Maria dancing
text: lead. She’s a very good dancer, very lively and quite sexy.
text: Most of all, she just has a good time - giggling and laughing
text: with Blanca. Juan and the guys are sitting on the curb
text: working their way steadily through the bottle of aguardiente.
text: The music stops and all the dancers fan themselves off - Juan
text: walks among the band members pouring each a shot of liquor.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (to Blanca)
dialog: Hey there’s your boyfriend.
text: Blanca follows Maria’s gaze and sees the SMILING GUY from
text: work talking with a FRIEND. Sure enough, he makes eye
text: contact with Blanca and smiles.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: (giggling and turning away)
dialog: Oh my god.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You have to dance with him.
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: No way!
text: Hearing that, Maria grabs Blanca’s wrist and leads her right
text: over to the Smiling Guy and his Friend.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: SMILING GUY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I’m Maria. This is Blanca.
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: (beet red)
dialog: Oh my god.
speaker_heading: SMILING GUY
dialog: I’m Felipe. This is my cousin Franklin.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Hi.
text: Unlike Felipe, Franklin is dressed stylishly, with a hip
text: shirt, designer jeans and a gold chain. Next to him, Felipe
text: looks downright meek.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Blanca wants you to ask her to dance.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Go for it.
speaker_heading: FELIPE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Do you want to dance?
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: ...OK.
text: Felipe leads Blanca out into the dance area as the band
text: strikes up. Maria watches them dance and then walks over to
dialog: Juan.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Juan, I want to dance.
text: Juan is clearly too drunk to dance and more interested in his
text: guy friends. He takes her in his arms and mock dances
text: drunkenly in a circle, laughing. She breaks away annoyed.
speaker_heading: MARIA (cont'd)
dialog: What’s wrong with you?
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: (drunk)
dialog: What... why?
text: She walks away and stands watching Blanca and Felipe.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (out of nowhere)
dialog: Wanna dance?
text: Maria considers it, glances toward Juan...
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN (cont'd)
dialog: What do you say?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: ...Sure.
text: Franklin leads her out and the two of them dance. The more
text: she dances, the more into it Maria gets - looking over at
text: Juan occasionally - as if she were dancing to spite him.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN — DAY
text: Maria walks the dirt road down the hill and into town.
text: She walks by several store fronts, looking occasionally
text: inside. Her gait is slow and not particularly determined.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC SHOP — DAY
text: Maria steps into a small music shop - basically just a glass
text: case with various CD’s, and racks full of cassettes on either
text: wall. A MAN catalogues boxes of music as Latin rap plays on
text: a small stereo. He nods at Maria - they seem to recognize
text: each other. She takes a tape off the wall and examines it.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: How much is it?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (turns the music down)
dialog: Fifteen thousand, two hundred.
text: Maria puts it back on the wall. She watches the man work.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You have a lot of work.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I have to catalogue everything, keep
dialog: track of what I sold, what I didn’t.
text: Maria contemplates asking him for a job... but the store is
text: obviously a one-man operation.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH — DAY
text: Maria comes into the Catholic CHURCH where a couple of older
text: women talk quietly in the pews. She kneels down, crosses
text: herself, mutters a Hail Mary, and then adds her own, silent
dialog: request.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORBIKE REPAIR SHOP — LATER
text: Maria and Blanca walk up to an outdoor garage that is packed
text: with mopeds and motorcycles. JUAN is squatting next to a
text: mechanic watching him work.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Juan.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: (looks up)
text: In a minute.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Come on.
dialog: (to Blanca)
dialog: I’1l see you later.
text: Blanca kisses Maria’s cheek and leaves as Juan finally
text: crosses to the front and gets his bicycle. He and Maria
dialog: cross the street to...
scene_heading: EXT. SAUSAGE STAND / PARK — LATER
text: A small stand serving arepas across from a park. Maria and
text: Juan each take an arepa and a Coca-cola. Juan pays and takes
dialog: the change.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: They walk over to the park and sit on the grass and eat.
text: They don’t have any conversation at all while they eat - they
text: just chew in silence. At a certain point Maria stops and
text: watches Juan take another bite - he’s absorbed in chewing.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I have something to tell you.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: ...-I think I’m pregnant.
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: You’re not fucking with me, right?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I missed my last two periods and I’ve
dialog: been feeling sick.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Who else knows?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Only you.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: No-one else?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Who else do you think I told? The whole
dialog: world?
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: I don't know. Maybe Blanca, since she
dialog: seems to know everything before me...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: No Juan, Blanca doesn’t know.
text: Long silence... Very long silence.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Maria... Do you want to get married?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (laughs nervously)
dialog: Are you joking?
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Where would we live?
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: In my house. Where else?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: There are like ten people living in your
dialog: house. You share your bedroom with your
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: What do you suggest?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: My house would be better.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Right, a lot better! A guy living in his
dialog: girlfriend’s house? No way, not that
dialog: Maria.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You're really fucking stupid, you know
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Stupid? Your family hates me. How do
dialog: you expect me to live there? We can live
dialog: at my house.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don’t see why you don’t want to get
dialog: married. I’m stepping up to this...
text: Maria takes a beat - stares at him.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Juan, do you love me?
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: (groans)
dialog: Not this again.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN TOWN — DAY

speaker_heading: FRANKLIN

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Really? You too.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: FRANKLIN

scene_heading: INT. BAR — DAY
text: It's a dimly-lit place with a pool table at the back and

dialog: soda.
text: Franklin comes back over and waits with Maria. A moment

text: definite eye contact with Maria as she walks out.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on.
text: Franklin introduces Maria to JAVIER, a well-groomed man of
text: about 60 with a gold chain, an ironed shirt and a cane
text: leaning up against the table. He effects an incredibly
text: paternal tone, calming but also intimidating.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Sit down.
text: Maria sits opposite him. Franklin pulls up a third chair.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (cont'd)
dialog: So, you're a friend of Franklin’s. And
dialog: how do you know each other?
text: Maria falters - looks to Franklin.
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN

speaker_heading: JAVIER

speaker_heading: JAVIER

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Do you eat a lot?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Normal.

speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Well then... We’re going to give you
dialog: several rolls of film. We’1ll send you to
dialog: New York... Actually to New Jersey - a
dialog: small town next to New York. Once you go
dialog: through Customs you'll be met by our
dialog: people. They will take you to a safe
dialog: place. We'll develop the rolls. And in
dialog: five, six days you'll be back here with
dialog: all your money taking care of your
dialog: problems.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: How much do I get?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: We’1l give you a hundred dollars a roll.
dialog: A girl your size you could make five or
dialog: six thousand depending on how much you
dialog: carry. Keep in mind we have to take care
dialog: of your documents. Meaning that after we
dialog: deduct the expenses for your passport and
dialog: visa and the other papers you'll get

dialog: (leans in)
dialog: But once your decision is made there’s no

dialog: Understand?
text: Javier stares hard at Maria.
speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: JAVIER

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I’m Lucy.
text: LUCY looks to be about 24. She's dressed nicely — not fancy,

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Do you work for Javier...? Is it hard?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (not making eye contact)
dialog: It's not easy but it's not too difficult
dialog: either... How old are you?
speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: if you found something... You have to go
dialog: back to the plantation and ask for your
dialog: job back.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: No, I don’t.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: It’s not fair to mom. You know how hard

dialog: things even worse.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Get off my back.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (getting emotional)
dialog: Don’t tell me to get off your fucking

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: So, he’s your responsibility.
speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: What job? Cut the shit.

scene_heading: EXT. STREET, A NEARBY TOWN — DAY
text: Maria walks up the street in another town, slightly bigger

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Hi.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY’S HOUSE — DAY
text: Lucy’s house is nice - spacious though vacant-feeling with a

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Here.

dialog: Hold it in your mouth.

speaker_heading: LUCY (cont'd)

speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to practice with the grapes.

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You can swallow that?

text: stares in horrified awe.
speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: For someone your size, maybe sixty or
text: seventy pellets.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Oh my god.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Be glad you're little. Big guys swallow
dialog: like ninety or a hundred... Make sure
dialog: they're well wrapped. If even one of
dialog: them opens up inside you you'll die. Not
dialog: as fast as cocaine. Cocaine will make
dialog: your heart explode immediately. Heroin
dialog: takes longer, but you still die unless
dialog: you get the right medicine.
text: Maria’s eyes widen.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wear nice clothes. Nothing flashy, just
dialog: something nice - so you don’t look like a
dialog: peasant. They may ask you questions in
dialog: the airport. Javier will tell you what
dialog: to say.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: How many times have you done this?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: ...Two.
speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: LUCY

dialog: years. But then I got there and I
dialog: realized, What am I going to tell her?
dialog: How am I going to explain how I got here?
dialog: I love her but we're really different,

text: table, a few chairs, a sink and a small bed in the corner.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: At the other end of the table is a YOUNG MAN, in his 20s.
text: He's got various paraphernalia spread out in front of him: a
text: BOX OF SEVERAL DOZEN RUBBER SURGICAL GLOVES, a pair of
text: SCISSORS, a ROLL OF PLASTIC WRAP, a DIGITAL SCALE, a small
text: box of DENTAL FLOSS, a BOTTLE OF SALAD OIL, a SMALL BOWL and
text: two bags of HEROIN.
text: He transfers a precise amount of heroin from the scale into
text: the severed finger of a latex glove, which he then places
text: into a HAND-OPERATED PRESS, pumping the lever and packing it
text: down into a dense one-inch capsule.
text: The pharmacist steps out of the room as Maria sits and
text: watches the young man, entranced...
scene_heading: SERIES OF JUMP CUTS:
text: He cuts the fingers off several of the rubber gloves. He then
text: slides the heroin capsule into a rubber finger and packs it
text: all the way down into the bottom.
text: He takes the finger full of heroin and stuffs it inside a
text: second rubber finger — then another and another until it's
text: been buried in SIX LAYERS of rubber fingers.
text: He breaks off a piece of DENTAL FLOSS and ties it shut like a
text: rubber balloon. He then trims off the excess dental floss
dialog: and the excess rubber.
text: He sets the "pellet" down — a snug little thumb-sized package
text: — and begins making another.
text: The pharmacist re-enters the room, breaking Maria’s trance.
text: He hands her two small PILLS and a cup of water.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: This will stop your bowels.
text: She puts the pills in her mouth and swallows them. The
text: pharmacist then raises a bottle of RED LIQUID with a tube and
text: an atomizer attached.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST (cont’d)
dialog: Open you mouth.
text: As he sprays the liquid into Maria’s throat, JAVIER steps in
text: and sits down at the table with her. The pharmacist finishes
text: and leaves the room.
text: Javier pulls the SMALL BOWL over to him and pours it full of
text: SALAD OIL. He takes one of the pellets and dips it in the
text: oil, completely covering it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: He passes it to Maria and she puts it in her mouth. She
text: tries to swallow it but GAGS.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Relax.
text: She puts the pellet back in her mouth and sets it deep in her
text: throat with her fingers.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't put your fingers in so much.
text: Maria starts to gag again.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you practice with the grapes?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: If you can't do this we'll stop now.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: No, really. I can do it. Just give me a
dialog: second.
text: Maria looks nervous. She puts the pellet in her mouth and
text: holds it there.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Just let it slide down.
text: She tilts her head back and the pellet goes down. She looks
text: very relieved.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: See.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Good.
text: He dips another pellet in oil and holds it out to her.
text: AN HOUR LATER - Maria paces around the room. The young man
text: packs up his stuff as Maria and Javier continue to work.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: How many is it so far?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Twenty-three.
text: Maria presses her stomach.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Here. Lay down on the bed.
text: She lays down. Javier places his hands on her stomach.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: They have to settle properly.
text: He massages her stomach, manipulating the pellets inside.
text: The door opens and the PHARMACIST brings in a bowl of SOUP.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Have some soup.
text: Maria gets up and sits at the table. She takes a spoonful of
text: soup with great trepidation. It hurts going down.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Do you want more anesthetic?
text: Maria shakes her head No. Javier places another pellet in her
text: bowl. She gets it on her spoon along with some soup and
text: stares at it.
text: A FEW HOURS LATER - the room is illuminated by early
text: afternoon light. Maria sits at the table with her head down.
text: Javier is holding out a pellet.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: One more.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Sixty-two. Come on.
text: She stares at him hatefully before taking the pellet. She
text: swallows it slowly but without gagging.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Good... I'll be right back.
text: He turns and leaves the room.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: Maria takes a beat alone. She goes to her things and removes
text: from her purse a toothbrush and a small tube of toothpaste.
text: She goes to the sink and brushes her teeth. She rinses and
text: spits and then catches sight of herself in the mirror.
text: Javier comes back in, sits at the table, and removes from his
text: wallet a wad of AMERICAN MONEY - 20-dollar bills. She sits.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: (hands her the money)
dialog: This is eight hundred dollars.
text: Maria stares at the money. Never in her life has she held
dialog: this much.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (cont'd)
dialog: When they ask you how much you're coming
dialog: to America with tell them eight hundred
dialog: dollars. Just say you've been saving up.
dialog: (handing her papers)
dialog: This is your ticket. Round trip - one
dialog: week. This is your passport and visa.
text: She stares at them - fascinated. He writes something on a
text: piece of PAPER and passes it to her.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (reads, mispronouncing)
dialog: Motor Lodge 46.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: That's the name and address of the hotel
dialog: where you say you’re staying. Do you
dialog: remember why you’re in America?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I'm on vacation.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: (testing her)
dialog: And how long are you here for?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: One week.
speaker_heading: JAVIER

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: JAVIER

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: JAVIER

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I’m going to stay in a hotel.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Which hotel?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Motor Lodge 46.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Good. How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Like hungry but full - it’s weird.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: You can drink on the plane but don’t eat
dialog: or it’ll make your stomach release acid.
dialog: Don’t talk to anyone on the plane. Even
text: the stewardesses spy for the DEA. Once
dialog: you've been passed through Customs you'll
text: come out through an electric sliding
dialog: door. On the other side of that there'll
dialog: be someone there to meet you.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: How will I know who it is?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: They'll know you. If they're not there
dialog: for some reason call this number.
text: He takes back the paper and writes a TELEPHONE NUMBER on it.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: The key is to stay calm and act like
dialog: nothing’s wrong. But if you do get caught
dialog: just keep quiet.
dialog: (he leans in)
dialog: If you give them any information we'll
dialog: leave you to rot in there while we go to
dialog: your house and have a chat with your
dialog: grandmother, your mother, your sister...
dialog: and little Pachito. Same thing if any of
dialog: what's in your stomach disappears along

speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)

text: He glares into her eyes. The effect is chilling.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT, X-RAY CHECK POINT — AFTERNOON
text: Maria puts her purse on the conveyor belt and steps through
text: the metal detector. One guard scans her up and down with
text: HANDHELD METAL DETECTOR and another then pats her down. As
text: Maria stares straight ahead she suddenly sees something odd:
text: BLANCA - dressed vampy with cleavage and lipstick - browsing
text: perfume at the duty-free shop. They make brief eye contact.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN — LATER
text: Maria gazes out the window as the plane picks up speed. She
text: crosses herself and mutters a Hail Mary. She closes her eyes
text: as her back is pressed up against the seatback and the plane
text: becomes airborne. For the first time in her life, she is off
text: the surface of the planet, flying. She stares out and
text: watches with fascination as the world shrinks away below her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The fasten seat belt sign is turned off with a soft CHIME.
text: The woman next to her (Carolina) undoes her seat belt and
text: gets up.
text: Maria looks over at the people on the other side of the
text: aisle. When she looks forward she is surprised to see LUCY
text: getting up and making her way to the aisle.
text: Maria unbuckles her seatbelt and then approaches Lucy, who is
text: getting a pillow and a blanket out of the overhead bin.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: I didn't know you were going again.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I didn't either. It just happened.
speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That's how it works. They send a bunch
dialog: of us so if one gets stopped it makes it
dialog: easier for the rest to slip through...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Oh...
text: A STEWARDESS suddenly passes behind them. They are both
text: immediately silent. Lucy moves back to her seat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Maria looks through the IN-FLIGHT MAGAZINE at all the
text: pictures: a spread on Disneyland, a photograph of a
text: businessman in a chic office...and then the MAP OF THE WORLD
text: with all of the airline’s flight paths indicated.
text: The DINNER CART is maneuvered slowly down the aisle.
text: Carolina pulls her airplane headphones out of one ear.
speaker_heading: CAROLINA
dialog: It's about time. I'm starved.
text: The stewardess approaches.
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Chicken or beef?
speaker_heading: CAROLINA
dialog: Chicken.
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: For you?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: ..-Chicken, please.
text: The stewardess turns to get the trays.
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Here you are.
text: And now Maria finds herself staring at a perfectly delicious
text: looking tray of steaming hot food. The woman next to her
text: unwraps her fork and decides to strike up conversation.
speaker_heading: CAROLINA
dialog: Do you go to the United States a lot?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Maria cuts off a piece of chicken and puts it in her mouth.
text: She chews but doesn’t swallow. Her neighbor is more
text: interested in talking than in listening.
speaker_heading: CAROLINA
dialog: I go every year to visit my daughter.
dialog: She married an American and they’ve got a
dialog: beautiful house on Long Island. Of
dialog: course, I think the children should be
dialog: the ones to come to Colombia to visit
text: their grandmother instead of the other
dialog: way around...
text: The woman TALKS and TALKS - oblivious to whether Maria is in
dialog: fact eating or not.
text: Maria carefully spits her food out into her napkin.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: LATER -
text: Maria is reaching up playing with the buttons and nozzles -
text: trying to figure out how to control the air. The seats next
text: to her are empty.
text: Suddenly, BLANCA is standing in the aisle. She looks over
text: her shoulder and quickly sits down in the empty seat next to
dialog: Maria.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: I saw you talking to that woman before.
dialog: Who was she?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: She's... you know...
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: You see that woman...
text: Maria leans forward and spots a woman (CONSTANZA) sitting one

speaker_heading: BLANCA (cont'd)
dialog: I met her before, through Franklin.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So what were you two talking about?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: She said if one of us gets stopped at

dialog: others to pass.
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: So who’s going to go first?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I don’t know. Whoever.
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: I don’t want to go first. I’11 wait and
dialog: see what happens to her.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I thought we were supposed to go right
dialog: through without waiting...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: «+I feel like when I’ve got my period.
speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: CAROLINA (0.S.)
dialog: Excuse me!
text: Carolina is standing in the aisle, looking annoyed.
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Sorry.
text: As Carolina settles back into her seat Maria places her
text: pillow under her ear and closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: LUCY - she sits in her seat dabbing her forehead with a
text: napkin. The cabin lights are dimmed, the in-flight movie
text: playing. Maria wakes up. Carolina has fallen asleep with
text: her headphones on.
text: Maria lifts her shirt and presses her abdomen in discomfort.
text: She unbuttons her pants trying to relieve the pressure.
text: She climbs over Carolina and moves to the aisle. CONSTANZA
text: looks up at her as she passes.
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE LAVATORY — CONTINUOUS
text: Maria locks the LAVATORY door and the lights come on. She
text: pulls down her pants and sits on the toilet. As she contorts
text: her face we hear the TINKLE of urine on metal.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN — CONTINUOUS
text: LUCY is sweating profusely, still dabbing herself with a
text: napkin. She doesn't look well. She gets up and maneuvers to
dialog: the aisle.
scene_heading: INT. LAVATORY — CONTINUOUS
text: Sitting on the toilet, Maria suddenly has a look of PANIC in
text: her eyes. Desperately she grabs paper towels from the
dialog: dispenser.
text: IN THE PLANE CABIN — Lucy walks slowly down the aisle. She
text: sees Blanca. The two of them lock eyes, but Lucy keeps
dialog: walking.
text: IN THE LAVATORY — Maria holds her hand under cold water in
text: the sink. She's rinsing off TWO PELLETS.
text: She opens her purse and removes her tube of TOOTHPASTE.
text: PLANE CABIN — Lucy comes to the back of the plane and waits
text: by the lavatory, looking sicker all the time.
text: LAVATORY — Maria squeezes toothpaste onto the second pellet,
text: smears it on and takes a beat. She puts the pellet in her
text: mouth, tilts her head back and swallows. She then looks at
text: herself in the mirror and tries to compose herself.
text: PLANE CABIN - Maria comes out of the lavatory, face to face
text: with LUCY. Lucy looks desperate — sweating, nervous.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I don't feel well.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: What are you going to do?
text: Lucy has a blank, nervous look on her face.
speaker_heading: MARIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Calm down. As soon as we arrive we're

text: casting a glance over her shoulder as she sits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The STEWARDESS works her way down the aisle with a stack of
text: YELLOW CUSTOMS CARDS. She gives them to Maria and Carolina.
text: Maria reads the card and gets to a blank space for an ADDRESS
text: where she plans to stay in the U.S. She reaches into her
text: pocket for the paper with the name of the hotel but she can’t
text: find it. She searches all her pockets and then in her purse
text: but the paper is nowhere.
text: She looks over to copy her neighbor’s answer but Carolina
text: finishes writing and tucks the card away.
text: Maria gets up and walks forward to the middle Emergency Exit
text: and turns to look at Lucy. Lucy, looking still worse,
text: notices Maria and gets concerned. She glances over her
text: shoulder, gets up and makes her way over to Maria.
speaker_heading: LUCY (cont'd)
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: I've been thinking about telling the
dialog: stewardess I'm sick. They could get me a
dialog: doctor.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: But you'll end up in jail once they find
dialog: out what's wrong with you.
speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT CORRIDORS — NIGHT
text: Lucy comes off the plane amid Constanza and other passengers.
text: Maria walks down the same corridor. Blanca follows Maria.
scene_heading: INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM / CUSTOMS AREA — CONTINUOUS
text: Maria stands by a large baggage carousel with other
text: passengers from the plane. She spots Blanca and Constanza at
text: various points across from her. Lucy stands about ten feet
text: away from her - looking sick but doing her best to keep her
text: nerves under control.
text: There are about FIFTEEN CUSTOMS INSPECTORS across the room —
text: men and women — looking bored, talking among themselves as
text: they wait for passengers to come through.
text: Bags tumble down the chute - some huge, some swathed in
text: plastic wrap. They get clogged on the carousel. Three
text: AIRPORT BAGGAGE HANDLERS unknot them. Passengers struggle to
text: pull their luggage off and head through Customs. Blanca takes
text: her bag off and lingers — as if waiting for a second bag.
text: Lucy pulls a SMALL RED SUITCASE off. She looks at Maria —
text: and then steps to the short line by the first two inspectors.
text: Maria looks down but there’s no sign of her suitcase.
text: Lucy — nervous and sick — hands her yellow card to the
text: inspector. He gives her a quick look and waves her through.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.
text: Lucy makes eye contact with Maria from the other side — and
text: then passes outside through a sliding electric door.
text: Constanza steps up to an inspector. The inspector asks her
text: something and then points to the secondary inspection point.
text: She looks mortified as she takes her bag over to be checked.
text: Blanca sees this, takes her bag and proceeds directly to
text: Customs. Maria looks desperate for her bag to come around.
text: Blanca gets at the end of the line at Customs. At last, Maria
text: grabs her bag off the carousel. She begins to move toward
text: the line but before she even gets there she is stopped by a
text: roaming INSPECTOR - a tall man with a buzz cut.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Place your suitcase on the counter...
dialog: Open it, please.

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR

speaker_heading: MARIA

scene_heading: FEMALE INSPECTOR #2
dialog: Place your hands on the wall... Higher...

speaker_heading: FEMALE INSPECTOR #2 (CONT'D)
dialog: Please, have a seat.

speaker_heading: MARIA

scene_heading: FEMALE INSPECTOR #2

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Vacation.
scene_heading: FEMALE INSPECTOR #2
dialog: You know what - I don’t believe you're

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: FEMALE INSPECTOR #2 (CONT'D)
dialog: Please sign this document permitting us

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: (playing the good cop)
dialog: Maria, listen, I’m going to be straight

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM — CONTINUOUS
text: In a tiny, white-tiled institutional bathroom the female

text: In front of the inspector Maria hikes up her skirt, sits on
text: the toilet and pees into the cup.
scene_heading: INT. MEDICAL FACILITY — MAIN AREA
text: Maria sits in a corridor waiting.
text: A door opens. CONSTANZA steps out followed by another
text: inspector who sits her down opposite Maria.
text: The two of them stare at each other. Constanza's eyes are
text: puffy and red. She's clearly been crying.
text: Through the open door, Maria can see in a white-coated
text: TECHNICIAN examining an X-ray with another inspector. He
text: takes out a pen and points to something. There are scores of
text: pellets clearly visible in Constanza’s stomach and
dialog: intestines.
text: The inspector takes the X-ray and walks over to Constanza.
text: He handcuffs Constanza and leads her down the hall.
text: Maria looks absolutely petrified. Thirty feet away the two

text: another white-coated technician. They turn and look at Maria
text: and shake their heads — something is wrong.
text: They walk toward Maria conversing with each other IN ENGLISH.

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: ...The truth is a friend bought it for

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR

scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT ARRIVALS TERMINAL — LATER

scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL — CONTINUOUS

text: waiting. He opens the sliding door, throws her inside and
text: slams the door shut behind her.
scene_heading: INT. VAN — CONTINUOUS
text: Totally spun around, Maria finds herself sitting next to LUCY
text: and BLANCA. There are TWO GUYS (CARLOS and WILSON) in the

dialog: very nervous quality.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: (to Maria)
dialog: What happened to the other one?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: They arrested her.
speaker_heading: CARLOS

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM — CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: The door opens - Wilson enters and flips on the light. The

scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - NEXT MORNING
text: Morning light burns through the curtains.
text: Blanca comes out of the bathroom with a handful of pellets,

text: watching TV. Maria lies on her bed also watching. Carlos
text: sits over by the window rolling himself a joint.
text: Lucy squats at her suitcase folding a shirt - moving slowly -
text: Maria keeps one eye on her, one on the TV. She glances at
dialog: Wilson.
text: Lucy sits on the chair and takes a deep breath.
text: Without blinking, Wilson clicks the remote a few times and
text: lands on something else: a news report (in Spanish) about
text: crowds of people flocking to see an apparition of the Virgin
text: on the side of a tree. As the news report ends, Wilson
text: crosses himself, kisses his crucifix and tucks it under his
dialog: shirt.

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Lucy! Lucy! LUucy!!!!
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM — BATHROOM — MOMENTS LATER
text: In the bathroom, Maria holds Lucy’s head under COLD WATER in

text: vigorously as a way of keeping her awake.
text: Maria and Lucy sit still on the edge of the tub. They have a
text: long moment in silence. Maria strokes her hair.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - EVENING

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM — NEXT MORNING
text: CLOSE-UP on Maria sleeping. We hear the sound of HUSHED,
text: AGITATED VOICES off screen, movement - there’s a shaft of
text: light as the bathroom door opens and then closes. Maria
text: rolls over and opens her eyes a crack, slow to adjust.
text: In MARIA'S POV — we see the two guys — one of them appears to
text: carry LUCY in his arms. Maria sits up a little, rubs her
text: eyes and refocuses.
text: And in another snippet of MARIA'S POV — we see the two guys
text: carrying Lucy, ARGUING in a panicked whisper as they leave
text: the hotel room and shut the door behind them.
text: Maria is totally unsure of what she's seen in her half-
text: sleeping-state. She sits up in bed. The room is strangely
text: quiet - the two guys are gone, Lucy is gone. Only Blanca lies
text: next to her asleep. She gets up and goes to the bathroom...
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM — BATHROOM — CONTINUOUS (MORNING)

scene_heading: INT. MOVING CAR, PULASKI SKYWAY — CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: CARLA

text: and Carla gives him a sheet.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: My cousin works in a bakery so he comes
text: home in the middle of the night. Just so
dialog: you're not startled.
text: Pablo snaps open the sheet and lets it fall on the mattress.

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT — NIGHT
text: Maria lies asleep in bed. There’s a KNOCKING on the
text: apartment door which wakes her up. She gets up and goes
text: slowly to the front door.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: Lucy (0S)
dialog: It’s Lucy.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Lucy?
speaker_heading: Lucy (0S)
dialog: Maria?
text: Maria quickly unbolts the door and opens it. But instead of
text: Lucy WILSON and CARLOS from the hotel burst in and pin Maria
text: against the wall. One of them rips at her shirt to reveal
text: her stomach. The man opens his KNIFE and aims at Maria's
text: belly, which suddenly appears NINE MONTHS PREGNANT. He
text: plunges the blade into her stomach. PELLETS pour out of her
text: by the hundreds onto the floor and inside each one is little
dialog: fetus.
text: IN BED, Maria wakes suddenly from the NIGHTMARE to the sound
text: of the door closing and FOOTSTEPS. She pretends to be asleep
text: as Pablo's brother ENRIQUE comes in and turns the light on.
text: He notices her lying there and then moves to the mattress.
text: Maria opens one eye to see him take off his shirt and then
text: turns away as he slips off his pants.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING — MORNING

scene_heading: EXT. / INT. CALLING STORE, QUEENS — MORNING

speaker_heading: CARLA
text: Lucy’s not there.
text: Carla steps out of the booth - Maria is slow to follow.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I want to call my family. Could you help
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: «OK.
text: Carla steps in with her, grabs the phone and dials the prefix
text: and then hands her the receiver.
speaker_heading: CARLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now just dial the number...
text: Maria closes herself into the booth, dials carefully and
text: waits for the line to ring. The muffled laughter of another
text: conversation filters through the wall behind her.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Hi, granny. It’s me Maria.
dialog: (her relief is instant)
dialog: How are you? Is everything OK there?...
dialog: I’m fine... It’s a good job. The trip

speaker_heading: PABLO

scene_heading: EXT. PARK — LATER
text: A row of about TEN CAR-SERVICE CARS are lined up along one

text: Hispanic, some Korean, some Black.
text: There’s a big game of soccer going on across the length of
text: the field. A few women sit in pairs in the grass. Maria and
text: Carla watch the game.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I used to think I’d be rich if I had two
dialog: hundred dollars. Here that’s nothing.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: CARLA

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: BLANCA

speaker_heading: CARLA

speaker_heading: DON FERNANDO
dialog: Can you sew?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: A little...not much...
speaker_heading: DON FERNANDO
dialog: What did you do back home?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: We worked in flowers.
speaker_heading: DON FERNANDO
dialog: There’s a place that sometimes needs
dialog: women to sew shirts. It’s not like
dialog: working in flowers but when they need
dialog: people they don’t check papers so
dialog: carefully and they pay minimum wage.
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: (suddenly)

scene_heading: EXT. ROOSEVELT AVENUE - LATER

text: an electronics store. She sees a Mexican guy at a corner

scene_heading: Spanish - “WOMEN’S CLINIC.”
scene_heading: INT. MEDICAL CLINIC, WAITING ROOM — CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: DOCTOR (CONT'D)

dialog: while you're pregnant. You must not
dialog: smoke. And you can't drink alcohol. No
dialog: beer. No wine. No drugs. Everything
dialog: you put into your body goes directly into
dialog: your baby. If you smoke it's like giving

speaker_heading: DOCTOR

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The camera holds on her as she walks through the terminal,

dialog: away.
text: Bit by bit, a certain relief takes over. Her gaze rises as
text: she walks - step by step leaving her past behind, looking
dialog: forward.
text: Maria moves ahead. A subtle but undeniable flicker of
text: determination in her eyes.
