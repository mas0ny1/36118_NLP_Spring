text: After the Universal logo, we open on a slow pan across a
text: turn-of-the-century dressing table. We see old photo-
text: graphs showing a small group of whores with their madam,
text: MISS WULLA JEAN, and the Sheriff of the small town of
text: Gilbert, SHERIFF JACK ROY WALLACE. There are also mementos
text: on the dressing table: a watch, reading glasses, a jeweled
