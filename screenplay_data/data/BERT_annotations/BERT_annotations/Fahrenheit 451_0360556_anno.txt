speaker_heading: SCREENPLAY BY
speaker_heading: FRANK DARABONT
dialog: - September 2005 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: IN SLO-MO, an object falls through frame -- a book. Rolling,
text: tumbling. Dropping from sight. Soon:
dialog: Another book. And another.
dialog: Books. Falling. And soon:
dialog: Raining. It's raining books. Why?
text: Now comes a VOICE, softly, sharing his most quiet and precious
dialog: thoughts:
speaker_heading: MONTAG (V.O.)
dialog: I love the soot. I love the heat. I
dialog: love the moment of combustion. Most
dialog: of all, the smell of kerosene. Here
dialog: is what I know: "Fire is bright.
dialog: Fire is clean. It is good to burn."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It is all I need to know.
speaker_heading: CuT TO:
text: A KLAXON HORN BLARING. RED LIGHTS SPINNING. A fire alarm --
scene_heading: INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: -- summoning to action:
text: FIREMEN, running, boots all a-scuffle, grabbing HELMETS off
text: pegs, yanking EQUIPMENT from storage lockers, cascading down
text: rows of brass poles through holes in the floor...
text: They swarm their beloved FIRE TRUCK, the Salamander, everybody
text: climbing up and taking positions on the running platforms,
text: dropping external seats and strapping in...
text: The ENGINES START, a turbine WHINE exploding to a DEEP BASSO
text: ROAR. Like a dragon waking up. Ready to breathe flame.
text: Headlights blaze to life. EMERGENCY STROBES turn the world
text: surreal. The Salamander moves out, the dragon leaving its
text: cave on massive multi-axle wheels...
scene_heading: EXT - FIREHOUSE/CITY STREETS - NIGHT
text: ..and emerging into the night.
text: Following close behind the Salamander is a second vehicle,
text: the CONTROL VAN -- armored, black, unfathomable.
text: HOMELESS. PEOPLE scatter from their path. Traffic pulls over.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE MOVING SALAMANDER
text: Noise and fury. CAPTAIN BEATTY looks back from his seat,
text: enjoying the expressions on the faces of his men -- tense,
text: exhilarated. He sees GUY MONTAG grinning into the wind.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Good for you, Montag!
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: What, sir?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: That grin! The fierce grin of all
text: men singed and driven back by flame!
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I love it, sir!
text: Beatty turns forward again, smiling...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: I know you do, son.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.0.)
dialog: Form up! Eyes front!
dialog: curt TO:
scene_heading: INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (TROOP INSPECTION)
text: ...and SCORES OF POLISHED BOOTS CLAP LIKE THUNDER. SCORES OF
text: POLISHED HELMETS, gleaming black and bearing the mark of 451,
text: snap in one direction. SCORES OF FIREMEN, chiseled of stone,
dialog: true believers all, stand ready.
text: Stepping before them, boots treading the silence with holy
text: authority, is Beatty. A man of power. Of conviction. A man
dialog: who knows his place in the world.
text: He stops. Takes them all in, his men of faith. He loves them
text: more than he loves himself. In a voice that fills the hall:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: An emperor of ancient China said:
dialog: "History begins with me."
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He was wrong. History begins with
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT - SALAMANDER - NIGHT (FIRE ALARM)
text: The Salamander rises hugely into view, cresting a street.
text: NEIGHBORS are pouring from their homes to watch. SEARCHLIGHTS
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
text: probe from the sky as POLICE HOVERCOPTERS circle whisper-quiet
text: overhead.
text: The Salamander stops with a HISS OF BRAKES. The control van veers
text: past it, taking up a supporting position. POLICE VEHICLES are
text: arriving to provide backup.
text: Firemen swarm from the Salamander, the night chaotic with FLASHING
text: LIGHTS and running men.
text: Beatty leads Montag and the others up a squalid lawn toward a
text: house. A MAN'S face, white and terrified, watches them approach
text: through the cracked panes of a window.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (shouting, muffled)
dialog: Go away! You've got the wrong house!
scene_heading: INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
text: Meanwhile, CONTROL PERSONNEL are studying the action on banks
text: of MONITORS, recording everything. One monitor flashes an
dialog: incoming message: "Warrant Authorization."
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Warrant is good. You have Supreme
dialog: Court approval to proceed.
scene_heading: EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Beatty and his men arrive at the doorstep.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Go away, I said! There's nothing
dialog: here!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Indeed.
dialog: (turns to his men)
dialog: There never is.
text: They rush the door with RAMS, blowing through it like a fist.
text: They swarm in, trailed by Beatty --
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0.)
dialog: Let me hear it, you men!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (TROOP INSPECTION)
text: -- and their voices boom like cannons:
speaker_heading: FIREMEN
text: FIRE IS BRIGHT! FIRE IS CLEAN! IT
dialog: IS GOOD TO BURN!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: And why is it good to burn? What
dialog: does fire do?
speaker_heading: FIREMEN
text: FIRE SWEEPS AWAY THE CLUTTER OF THE
dialog: PAST!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: And why is that good, you men? What
dialog: does that provide?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIREMEN
text: A BRIGHT AND SHINING FUTURE!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Let me hear it!
speaker_heading: FIREMEN
text: A BRIGHT AND SHINING FUTURE!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Again!
speaker_heading: FIREMEN
text: A BRIGHT AND SHINING FUTURE!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - HOUSE - NIGHT (FIRE ALARM)
text: A HANDHELD SCENE of screaming chaos:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I told you there's nothing here!
text: The WIFE launches herself at the husband, slapping him,
text: flailing and screaming --
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Idiot! I told you this would happen!
dialog: I told you!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Shut up! Shut up!
text: -- and the firemen separate them, restraining them both, her
text: eyes landing on Beatty as:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Madam?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: He's right...there’s nothing
dialog: here...nothing...
dialog: 
text: Beatty raises his PLASMA SCREEN CLIPBOARD, studies it:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: ~ Mr. and Mrs....Mugniani? Did I
dialog: pronounce that right?
text: His eyes go to THREE SHRIEKING CHILDREN being herded into the
text: room by the firemen.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: And the three Mugniani children.
dialog: Victor, Paul...and little Emily...
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: -..-no...don't hurt them...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Madam, please. We're not savages,
dialog: after all.
dialog: (to his men)
dialog: Outside.
text: The family is dragged out, the woman SCREAMING as she's pulled
text: out the door...
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: NOT MY HOUSE! NOT MY HOUSE!
scene_heading: ~ CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Montag? If you please?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Sir!
dialog: (turns to the men)
dialog: LET'S GO!
text: -+-and they spread throughout the house, tossing the place,
text: pounding on walls and listening for the hollow sounds...
scene_heading: INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
text: -.-While the images are fed to the monitor screens in real
text: time from the firemen's helmet-cams, recording everything.
scene_heading: INT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Beatty waits in the whirlwind, serene, taking it all in.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
text: comes to a floor-to-ceiling display shelf lined with dishes
text: and bric-a-brac. He runs his hand up the side, trying to get
text: his fingers behind it. It's sealed to the wall.
speaker_heading: VW
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Shelf!
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
text: He pulls an X-RAY WAND as two firemen rush to his side, also
text: pulling wands. Montag activates his, playing a lavender light.
text: He taps a button on his helmet, causing a clear RED VISOR to
text: lower over his eyes --
speaker_heading: MONTAG'S POV
text: -- which, in combination with the wand, gives an X-RAY IMAGE
text: through the shelves and into the wall. He sweeps the wand,
text: seeing vague shapes appearing like ghosts -- tall, slender,
text: rectangular, hidden in the wall among the studs.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I got something.
speaker_heading: FIREMAN #1
dialog: Me too!
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (clicks his comlink)
dialog: Control?
scene_heading: INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
text: We're seeing the ghost images in the wall coming across the
text: monitors. CONTROLLER #1 taps his keyboard...
speaker_heading: CONTROLLER #1
dialog: Hold on. Hold on.
text: -+-and a computer schematic forms on screen, outlining the
text: shapes in glowing red lines. The computer extrapolates the
text: image, lifting one of the objects out as an animated wire-
text: form. It's a book. The computer revolves the image, opening
text: the covers, riffling the pages.
speaker_heading: CONTROLLER #1
dialog: You're confirmed.
scene_heading: INT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Montag and the others jam pry bars behind the shelf, ripping
text: it loose from the wall in an explosion of plaster and wood.
text: It topples, revealing a hidden library, the space in the wall
text: lined with books.
text: They start pulling out armloads of books, hurling them across
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: VARIOUS ANGLES
text: as the search continues. Firemen play wands on sofas...over
text: floors...up walls...across the ceiling. Suddenly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIREMAN #2
dialog: Attic! I got a crawl space!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: (glances up)
dialog: Attic. How original.
speaker_heading: TIMECUT :
text: A PAIR OF ROARING CHAINSAWS rise up on long extensions and
text: chew into the ceiling, spewing debris, cutting two long
text: parallel grooves down the hallway...
text: ...and the ceiling collapses, dropping awesomely into the
text: hallway bringing a ton of books with it.
text: The dust doesn't even have time to clear before another section
text: of the ceiling unexpectedly gives way --
text: -- and a YOUNG MAN plummets as well. He hits the floor hard,
text: scrambles to his feet in the billowing plaster dust, wild
text: with fear and adrenaline, swinging a baseball bat.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
text: BASTAAARDS! BASTAAARDS!
text: Montag gets hit in the arm and spins against the wall,
text: clutching his bicep. The kid keeps swinging, scattering firemen
text: as he flees down the hall and out the back door.
speaker_heading: FIREMAN #4
dialog: (amped up)
dialog: Go after him?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: No, let the Hound deal with it.
dialog: (raises his plasma screen) )
dialog: Montag? Injured?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: No! I'm okay!
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Let's keep going!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: That's the spirit...
dialog: (tapping his touch screen)
dialog: ---hmmm. Our unexpected guest would
dialog: be who? The nephew?
text: Beatty's clipboard brings up an image of the young man's face.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Ah, yes, here it is. Nephew. Joseph.
dialog: (as data scrolls)
dialog: Physiologicals...DNA...
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
text: Beatty inputs the data and enters a command: "Activate Hound."
text: He hits the send button with a flourish.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of
dialog: war.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (passing by)
dialog: What the hell does that mean?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It means: "Good boy. Fetch."
scene_heading: EXT - SALAMANDER - NIGHT
text: The "kennel" at the rear of the truck opens, steel plates
text: fanning out to reveal darkness within.
text: We hear something stir...something metallic. A pair of eyes
text: activate, glowing red.
text: It emerges into half-light with a SOFT WHINE of servos and
text: gears -- the head of a dog rendered in alloy and chromium
text: steel. We hear a GROWL rising in its manufactured throat.
text: It leaps out, revealed fully as it hits the pavement on rubber-
text: padded paws. The MECHANICAL HOUND. A living Deco sculpture, a
text: chromium canine nightmare.
text: The neighbors shout, thrilling at the sight of it, some clapping
text: and whistling, others drawing back in giddy carnival fear.
text: The Hound takes off running like a heat-seeking missile.
scene_heading: EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT
text: Joseph, the nephew, is running, still clutching the bat. He
text: suddenly stops, hearing: A DISTANT HOWL. The Hound. It's coming
text: for him. The young man keeps going, gasping in panic..
scene_heading: INT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: -while Beatty assesses the shambles of the house, kicking
text: through snowdrifts of books at his feet. He picks one up,
text: idly flips a page or two.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Beacon on the lawn?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Yes, why not? Give the neighbors a
dialog: thrill. Good for public relations.
text: Montag grins, waving the others toward the door...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Scooper! Let's give 'em a show!
scene_heading: EXT - ALLEYS - NIGHT
text: ...and Joseph runs, twisting and turning down the alleyways,
text: looking over his shoulder as if the devil were in pursuit...
scene_heading: EXT - HOUSE - ON THE LAWN - NIGHT
text: A SCOOPER, a mini electric bulldozer, dumps a final load of
text: books atop a "beacon" -- a round titanium-mesh platform that
text: looks like a trampoline. Plenty of updraft.
text: As the Scooper backs away, we ANGLE TO:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Pumpers!
text: And double-timing into the shot are a DOZEN FIREMEN with
text: kerosene pumpers on their backs, led by:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Dillman! You're on beacon! Rest of
dialog: you, with me!
text: They run toward the house, snapping gas masks across their
text: faces. Dillman veers off toward the beacon...
scene_heading: INT - HOUSE - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT
text: -.-While Montag and the rest enter, spreading out. They begin
text: pumping kerosene throughout the house, soaking the walls, the
text: heaps of books, the furniture, priming it like a bomb...
scene_heading: EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT
text: ++-and still Joseph runs...breath exploding...feet pounding
dialog: the asphalt...
scene_heading: EXT - SALAMANDER - NIGHT
text: -.-and the firemen back up to the truck to hang the pumpers
text: on their frames. They unbuckle the straps, shrug free.
text: Six men (including Montag) turn as the other firemen help
text: them into their special padding, their long coats of fire-
text: retardant leather, their thick gloves, their blast helmets...
scene_heading: EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT
text: -.-and Joseph glances back, his worst nightmare realized as
text: the Hound appears from the darkness, veering in pursuit...
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
text: ...and we see Joseph through the eyes of the Hound, broadcast
text: live over monitors in ghastly tones of night-vision green...
speaker_heading: CONTROLLER #2
dialog: We have target acquisition.
scene_heading: EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT
text: ...feet pound...rubber-padded paws pursue...
scene_heading: EXT - SALAMANDER - NIGHT
text: ..-.and the six firemen back up to the truck again, shrugging
text: now into the straps of the FLAMETHROWERS lining the vehicle.
text: Buckles are snapped. They lift the flamethrowers onto their
text: backs -- twin tanks, ribbed copper hose, nozzles of chrome...
scene_heading: EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT
text: ...and the Hound makes a flying leap, taking Joseph to the
text: pavement in a snarl of glittering titanium teeth...
scene_heading: INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
text: ...and Joseph's screaming face comes over the monitor screens
text: as the Hound savages him, chomping viciously down on his arm...
scene_heading: EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT
text: ...and the Hound's HYPODERMIC TONGUE whines from its throat,
text: plunging.the needle deep into Joseph's flesh, the amber
text: contents emptying as the plunger depresses. Soon Joseph stops
text: screaming and goes dopey from the drug...
scene_heading: EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: .-while Beatty receives the information on his plasma screen
text: clipboard: "Suspect In Custody."
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Procaine. That should calm him down.
text: He turns, motioning "proceed."
scene_heading: MONTAG AND THE FIREMEN
text: approach six abreast, fully clad in protective gear, helmets
text: gleaming, flamethrower nozzles held like weapons.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0.)
dialog: Yes. Fire is bright. Fire is clean...
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
text: They stop in a row, activating their gas feeds with a SOFT
text: HISS. Others rush in with igniters, providing the spark. Pilot
text: flames are lit, billowing up from the nozzles like torches...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0O.)
text: ...fire sweeps away the clutter of
dialog: the past. It is harmony...serenity...
dialog: and light. It is our credo...our
dialog: religion...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT (TROOP INSPECTION)
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: ...and we are its high priests. We
dialog: say mass at flashpoint. Deliver our
dialog: benediction at four hundred and
dialog: fifty one degrees of Fahrenheit. We
dialog: soothe the world with our nozzles
dialog: of chromium steel, absolve its sins
dialog: with our sermons of heat. And when
dialog: the sermon is done, we've turned
dialog: sorrow and lies to ash, like
dialog: alchemists and magicians of old.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let me hear it again, you men!
dialog: Inspire me!
text: Their voices boom again like cannons:
speaker_heading: FIREMEN
text: FIRE IS BRIGHT! FIRE IS CLEAN! IT
dialog: IS GOOD TO BURN!
text: CAMERA ANGLES INTO the arrow-straight lines of firemen to
text: settle upon Montag. Proud. Shouting loudest of all...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT (FIRE ALARM)
text: .--and Montag steps onto the lawn, the other firemen falling
text: into flanking positions at his side. They set their feet, aim
text: their flamethrowers at the beacon --
text: --and begin to burn. WHOOOOOSH--BOOM! STREAMS OF FIRE shoot
text: across the lawn and the beacon erupts skyward on a BALL OF
text: FLAME. Everybody shies back, the bonfire lighting up the night,
text: pushing everybody back with heat.
text: Captain Beatty sees the husband and wife in custody. His
text: attention goes to the children, staring at the flames with
text: tear-streaked faces. He crouches, gentle:
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Here's a good lesson for you
dialog: children. You'll remember this.
dialog: (brushes the little girl's
dialog: cheek)
dialog: Be good citizens.
speaker_heading: THE FIREMEN
text: turn to the house. Montag takes lead position, fires a
text: flamethrower blast through the front door.
scene_heading: INT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: There's an awesome beat as the kerosene fumes ignite, the
text: very air itself catching fire...followed by a stunning SERIES
text: OF BOOMING DETONATIONS hurtling down hallways and through
text: rooms, funnels of flame ROARING like living things, shattering
text: glass and peeling walls, eating piles of books.
scene_heading: EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The living room EXPLODES, blowing the windows out into the
text: street, staggering Montag back on a concussion wave of heat.
text: The other firemen join in, hosing the house with flame from
text: all directions. EXPLOSIONS punch through the roof, blow out
text: the walls, hurl enormous BALLS OF FLAME into the night sky.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
text: backs away with the others, seared by the heat.
text: CAMERA CLOSES IN on him as he snaps his protective faceplate
text: up and wrenches his breather mask aside, wanting to feel the
text: heat on his goddamn face. Exhilarated. Worshipping the flame.
text: And as we COME INTO CLOSE-UP, we again hear his voice speaking
dialog: his most quiet and precious thoughts:
speaker_heading: MONTAG (V.O.)
dialog: Four hundred and fifty one degrees
dialog: of Fahrenheit. This is where I live.
dialog: The rest is just waiting...and
text: kerosene dreams.
text: The flames billow into the sky, roiling smoke as we
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT - FIREHOUSE LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
text: It's dark. Quiet. Montag's freshly showered and wearing his
text: off duty uniform. He pulls his fireman's ID necklace from a
text: peg on the locker door, kisses the good luck pendant, hangs
text: the simple chain around his neck. The fireman's credo ("Fire
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
text: is bright, fire is clean...") is taped inside the locker,
text: alongside a photo of his wife MILLIE.
text: He shuts the locker, grabs his gym bag...
scene_heading: INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: ...and moves through the firehouse. The late shift is settling
text: in, some men on bunks, others engaged in quiet activity. He
text: passes a poker game in progress. A few men mutter "good-night."
text: Montag pauses at the Captain's door, sees Beatty working at
text: his desk in a pool of light. Beatty senses him, glances up.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Heading home?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Yes, sir. You?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Soon as I finish my report. You're
dialog: mentioned. Damn fine work earlier,
dialog: my boy. Well done.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Thank you, sir. Good night.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Good night. Sleep the sleep of the
dialog: just.
text: Montag moves on. As he approaches the brass poles, he passes:
text: The Mechanical Hound. Lying in its firehouse kennel with its
text: head on its paws. Waiting. Patient as only a machine can be.
text: Montag grabs a brass pole and plummets from view as we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT - CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: Montag walks with his gym bag. HOMELESS PEOPLE are clustered
text: around trash can fires, milling like herd animals. Those that
text: see him coming make sure to get out of his way. Firemen are
text: clearly figures of authority to be feared and respected.
text: PLASMA VIDEO DISPLAYS are everywhere -- monitor screens on
text: street corners, huge projections on the sides of buildings,
text: ads playing on the sides of buses like living billboards. We
dialog: have seen the future, and it ain't quiet -- everywhere you
dialog: look, they're trying to sell you or convince you.
text: Montag heads up the steps to:
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: EXT - TRANSIT STATION PLATFORM - NIGHT
text: Several large public VIDEO DISPLAYS are playing the latest
text: war news, showing a hallucinatory montage of night-vision
text: smart bomb explosions set to stirring theme music. Montag
text: stares at the images as he stands waiting for his train.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.0O.)
dialog: ..-while hours ago a stunning
dialog: precision strike leveled half the
dialog: enemy capital in retaliation for
dialog: the cowardly attack last Wednesday
dialog: that claimed the lives of 241 of
dialog: our brave coalition Marines...
text: . A MAG-LEV TRAIN arrives, gliding silently in. He gets on.
scene_heading: INT - MOVING MAG-LEV TRAIN - NIGHT
dialog: Even here the media barrage continues -- what years ago would
text: have been silent advertising placards lining the car on both
text: sides are, in this day and age, moving video and sound images.
dialog: Buy this. Buy that. Hey, have you heard the latest? Be sure
dialog: to tune in! The hottest infotainment! The best gossip!
text: Montag sits with the glazed expression of a veteran commuter,
text: pretty much tuning it out. Some of his fellow PASSENGERS cast
text: nervous looks his way, but Montag ignores it.
scene_heading: EXT - MOVING TRAIN - NIGHT
text: CAMERA PULLS AWAY from Montag at the window to reveal the
text: train suspended from overhead tracks several hundred feet in
text: the air, rocketing through canyons of downtown skyscrapers,
text: one of many trains doing the same.
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: EXT - OUTLYING SUBURBS - NIGHT
text: It's quiet and sparse compared to the city, which dominates
text: the skyline b.g. A few video displays flicker at deserted
text: intersections. There's not a soul in sight, except:
text: Montag is walking home from his train stop, gym bag at his
text: side. He slows, hearing something strange:
text: The sound of a CHILD SINGING.
text: He stops, perplexed. What the hell is a child doing outside,
dialog: and at this time of night?
text: He moves to a low fence. The house beyond it is ramshackle
text: but tidy, set back on a property overgrown and wild. As he
text: approaches, the unseen child hears him and falls silent.
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
text: Montag peers over the fence, scanning the darkness. Nothing
text: but bushes and trees.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Who's there?
text: Silence. Like breath being held.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Come out where I can see you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's all right. I'm your neighbor.
dialog: I live a few doors down.
speaker_heading: CHILD (0.S.)
dialog: I know. I've seen you walking home.
text: CLARISSE eases from behind a tree, her face beautiful in the
text: moonlight. She's nine years old.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: You're that fireman.
text: Montag pauses, oddly captivated by the little girl. Seeing
text: her is the last thing he expected.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You say that like it's scary.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
text: Fireman are scary. They come at
dialog: night and burn down your house.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Only if you've broken the law. I'm
dialog: sure you haven't. Have you?
text: She shakes her head gravely. Montag smiles -- he was joking,
text: but the little girl's so serious he wants to laugh.
speaker_heading: : MONTAG
dialog: I didn't think so. So there's nothing
dialog: to be scared of. Is there?
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: I suppose.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: What are you doing out so late?
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: Making up songs.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Songs.
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: My uncle says I'm odd.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I'd have to agree.
text: A POLICE CAR appears, pinning Montag in its spotlight as he
text: turns and shields his eyes. Clarisse ducks, unseen behind the
text: fence, light spilling through the cracks in the boards. TWO
text: COPS are faceless behind the glare:
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Identify.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Guy Montag. Fireman. District four.
text: dust heading home from my shift.
scene_heading: IN THE POLICE CAR
text: A dash-mounted PLASMA SCREEN echoes Montag's words, producing
text: a wave pattern I.D. match. The screen brings up Montag's image.
speaker_heading: RESUME MONTAG
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: Have a good one.
text: The spotlight kicks off and the cruiser moves on.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: That's your name? Mr. Montag? I'm
dialog: Clarisse.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Clarisse.
text: Montag resumes walking slowly along the fence. Clarisse keeps
text: pace with him on the other side.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: Do you like being a fireman?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Of course I do. What kind of question
dialog: is that?
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: I'm just wondering. I never spoke
dialog: to a fireman before. Do you ever
dialog: read the books you burn?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: No. That's against the law. Even
dialog: for firemen.
text: Montag stops
dialog:

speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: But you still like it?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: We protect people. Keep them safe.
dialog: People like you. Your mom and dad.
dialog: Your uncle.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: He was arrested once for being a
dialog: pedestrian.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: He must have been doing something
dialog: aside from walking.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: No, just walking. My uncle's odd,
text: too. He says it runs in the family.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: What else does your uncle say?
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: He says once upon a time firemen
dialog: used to put out fires. Is that true?
text: short, laughs.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: No. He's making that up.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You should go back inside. Your
dialog: parents will worry.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: They don't mind. They say it's safer
text: at night. Because of the curfews.
dialog: So I come out in the yard sometimes.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: It's nice at night, 'cause it's so
dialog: quiet. I like to smell things. And
dialog: look at things. Sometimes if you look
dialog: real hard, there's a man in the moon.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You mean the mining colonies?
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: No, silly, a man. You can see his
text: face, there on the moon.
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
text: He stops, stares up at the full moon, but:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I don't see him.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: He's there. You have to look hard.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Clarisse!
text: A MAN emerges in the darkness, coming from the house.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Come away from there. You shouldn't
dialog: be talking to strangers.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: It's our neighbor, Mr. Montag.
text: The man pauses, dappled in shadow, eyeing Montag with caution.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Please excuse my daughter. She's
text: very young.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: No harm done.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Come along, Clarisse. It's late.
text: He takes her hand and pulls her away. As they head off toward
text: the house, Clarisse looks back:
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: Mx. Montag? Are you happy?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: That's enough now. Time for bed.
text: They vanish across the darkness of the lawn. Montag stands
text: gazing after them, flummoxed by the encounter. Softly:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Am I happy?
text: He moves on...
scene_heading: INT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: ..-and enters in darkness. He deposits his gym bag, hangs his
text: fireman's jacket, muttering:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: What kind of question is that?
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
dialog: ‘He proceeds into --
speaker_heading: THE KITCHEN
text: -- where he pulls a Ready Meal from the freezer and pops it
text: in the microwave. The microwave emits a three-second pulse...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Of course I'm happy.
text: ...and he pulls the meal out, now piping hot. He pops the
text: lid, blows on it, grabs a fork...
text: ...and exits into the hallway, eating, careful not to burn
text: his mouth. He moves up the darkened hallway toward CANNED
text: VOICES and flickering light coming from the TV room.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie? Honey? I'm home...
speaker_heading: THE TV ROOM
text: The room is a TV, the plasma screen walls creating a complete
text: visual wrap-around. Some banal infotainment program is playing,
text: peddling trivialities and flashy visuals to an empty room.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: off.
text: The room goes dark. Montag proceeds up the hallway.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie?
speaker_heading: THE BEDROOM
text: Montag enters. It, too, seems empty. As he turns to leave,
text: his foot hits something, sends it rolling across the floor.
text: It's a pill bottle. Empty. Montag stares down at it, trying
text: to divine its meaning. He turns back into the room, sees:
text: A woman's pale foot lying on the floor past the bed.
text: He darts past the bed and finds MILLIE sprawled unconscious,
text: vomit staining her mouth and pooling on the floor.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: ..oh, God...
text: He goes to his knees, checking her pulse.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie! Millie!
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Dial medical emergency!
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: Dialing.
text: Panicking, Montag pulls her to a sitting position and gets
text: his fingers in her mouth, trying to clear the vomit.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Honey. Honey, it's me. Breathe.
dialog: Breathe.
speaker_heading: RECORDED VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Medical 911. All our lines are busy.
dialog: Please stay on the--
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Cancel! Damn it!
text: Desperate, moving fast, Montag pulls Millie to her feet and
text: slings her arm around his neck.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Dial Captain Beatty! Home number!
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: Dialing.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS HANDHELD as he pulls her to the bedroom door
text: and walks/drags her up the hallway...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: C'mon, Millie. C'mon, baby. Can you
dialog: hear my voice?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0.)
dialog: Yes? Hello?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Captain! It's Montag!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0.)
dialog: Montag? What's the problem, you
dialog: sound strange...
text: Montag gets to the bathroom, pulls Millie inside...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I need help! It's my wife! She's
dialog: sick! I...I think she's overdosed
dialog: on levelers and I can't get through
dialog: on the emergency lines!
dialog: (to the sink)
dialog: Water! Cold!
text: +..and the faucet starts. He leans her over the sink, splashing
text: her face, sailing on adrenaline and panic as:
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0O.)
dialog: Hold on. I'll use my priority code.
dialog: I'll be off the line a moment.
text: A CLICK. Montag keeps splashing her face, cleaning the vomit
text: from her mouth. He lets her sag, lays her down on the floor...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Breathe, honey, breathe.
text: ...and starts giving her mouth-to-mouth, trying to clear her
text: breathing passage. She's choking, floundering.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie, goddamn it, BREATHE!
text: Another CLICK as Beatty comes back on the line:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY (V.0O.)
dialog: Hang in there, Montag. Help's on the way.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A WHINE OF TURBINES descends from above, rippling the air
text: with heat signature exhaust. Montag rushes outside as a HOVER
text: AMBULANCE drops from the sky and touches down.
scene_heading: INT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The MEDICS rush Millie outside on a gurney with Montag at
dialog: their heels.
scene_heading: INT - AMBULANCE - NIGHT
text: The gurney is slid into the bay and the MEDICAL TEAM goes to
text: work. Automated systems engage. Imaging scanners sweep her
text: body. Needles descend on robotic arms, find her veins, pierce
text: her skin to draw blood. Plasma screens activate as:
speaker_heading: MEDIC #1
dialog: Subject. Mildred Evers Montag. Okay,
dialog: let's see some history here...
dialog: (rapping the touchscreen)
dialog: Piece of crap, c'mon.
text: Millie's info appears, scrolling. The medic works the
text: touchscreen, everything moving fast:
speaker_heading: MEDIC #1
dialog: No pre-existing conditions...no
dialog: medication allergies...
speaker_heading: MEDIC #2
dialog: Blood analysis?
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: MEDIC #1
dialog: Levelers, big-time. Plus a little
text: vodka. She's floating.
text: A probe is used to clear her trachea. A hose is fed down her
text: throat, the stomach pump engaged. The contents of her stomach
text: are hosed into a clear plastic bag as:
speaker_heading: MEDIC #3
dialog: Get that adrenaline into her! Get
dialog: those scrubbers going!
text: More pumps activate. The blood starts draining from her body
text: via tubes, then run through a system of spinning filters and
text: re-deposited in her veins. Things start to calm as:
speaker_heading: MEDIC #1
dialog: Okay, let the machine do its work.
dialog: Couple of cycles should do it.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
text: is watching the whole thing through the rear doors of the
text: ambulance. Medic #1 steps down and joins him.
speaker_heading: MEDIC #1
dialog: Her vital signs are coming up. She'll
dialog: be all right.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Are we taking her to the hospital?
speaker_heading: MEDIC #1
dialog: Nah, this is outpatient stuff, we
dialog: do it all the time. Recycle her
dialog: blood, she'll be fine. She'll sleep
dialog: like crazy, though, so don't let
dialog: that scare you. It's normal.
text: He moves off. Montag watches his unconscious wife lying there
text: as the machines hum. The POLICE CAR reappears:
speaker_heading: LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
text: RETURN TO YOUR HOMES. CURFEW IS IN
scene_heading: EFFECT. RETURN TO YOUR HOMES... ,
text: Montag turns, sees groups of NEIGHBORS watching from the
text: sidewalks up and down the street. They turn and head back
dialog: into their homes.
text: Montag looks to Clarisse's house. She and her family are
text: watching from their porch. They're at a distance, but even
text: from here Montag can feel the little girl's gaze as we
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: INT - BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Montag awakens to find Millie's side of the bed empty...
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: ...and he emerges from the bedroom. The TV room is already
text: on, but also empty. He continues up the hallway to --
speaker_heading: THE KITCHEN
text: -- where he finds Millie making breakfast, pale and drawn,
text: drifting like a ghost. PLASMA TVs are playing in here, too,
dialog: drawing her attention as:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Morning.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Hey. You overslept.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (watching her carefully)
dialog: How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Hungry. I don't know why I'm so
dialog: hungry. I'm starving.
dialog: (looks to him)
dialog: Did we have people over last night?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Yeah. Some people came.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: I'm so hung over. I remember somebody
dialog: talking to me. Saying something. I
dialog: hope I didn't make a fool of myself.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie...about last night...
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Why'd you let me drink so much?
dialog: I've got this taste in my mouth.
dialog: Ugh...did I throw up? Did anybody
dialog: see?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie, listen...
text: Suddenly, a SOFT VOICE announces:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Mrs. Montag. It's time for the
dialog: Family. Mrs. Montag...
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: The Family's here. Let's talk about
dialog: this tonight.
text: Hurrying now, she gathers her tray, pauses --
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: You okay? You look terrible.
text: -- and exits into the hallway. Montag follows her.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: We should talk about this now.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Honey, it's the Family. And you
dialog: have to get ready for work. We'll
dialog: talk tonight.
dialog: She enters:
speaker_heading: THE TV ROOM
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: No we won't. There'll be some other
dialog: program on tonight.
text: Montag hovers in the doorway as she heads to her favorite
text: chair, one that swivels 360 degrees.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: I'm here!
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: ...welcome you again to the warm
dialog: bosom of the Family. Bringing you
dialog: love, life, commitment...all the
dialog: things you treasure most...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie, please...
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Honey, shhh. I never miss the Family,
dialog: you know that...
text: We're suddenly surrounded on all sides by a beach. The digital
text: clarity of the image is stunning, the enveloping 360 so
text: convincing it's almost as if we've been transported there.
text: The FIVE CHARACTERS on the plasma screens are life-sized,
text: walking along the surf, talking earnestly:
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm not trying to be controlling,
dialog: but I am her father.
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I agree. This is a huge decision
dialog: that will affect her entire life.
speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: But it's her life, let's not forget
dialog: that. We can't live it for her.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Of course. But we are a family, and
dialog: I feel it bears discussion. What do
dialog: you think, Millie?
text: The characters hit a cue-loop and stop, looking at Millie,
text: awaiting her answer. This is an interactive soap opera:
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Yes. Yes, of course I agree. It
dialog: certainly bears discussion.
text: The characters resume walking.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thank you, Millie. We can always
dialog: count on you to be the voice of
dialog: reason.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Millie dear. You are such a comfort
dialog: to this family.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: I'm always so happy to help.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Now, Jenny...about this marriage
dialog: proposal...what do we really know
dialog: about this fellow...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You took all the pills in your bottle
dialog: last night.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Your levelers. You took them all.
text: On screen, the characters pause, looking again to Millie:
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm sorry, Millie...did you say
dialog: something?
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: No, no...please continue.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You had to have your stomach pumped
dialog: and your blood recycled.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: That's ridiculous. I wouldn't do a
dialog: thing like that.
speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: (pausing)
dialog: What's ridiculous, Millie dear?
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: (to the screen)
dialog: Just ignore me. I'm talking to
dialog: myself. Please continue.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: He's from an excellent family, but
dialog: what does it matter? I'm so in love,
dialog: I've never felt this way before...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: But you did. The bottle was empty.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: That's not possible. I wouldn't do
dialog: that. Why would I do that?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Maybe you took a few and forgot.
dialog: Then took a few more.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: That's stupid. I didn't. Why would
dialog: I?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I don't know. I'm asking.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: I wouldn't. Not in a billion years.
text: She's distracted, trying to follow the discussion on screen.
text: Montag comes up behind her, trying to get her attention:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Am I lying to you? Millie? Is that
dialog: what you think? That I'd look you
dialog: in the eye and lie to you?
text: He puts his hand on her shoulder, but she slaps it away:
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: No! You're just wrong! You're being
dialog: stupid, so stop it! Let me watch my
dialog: program! I'm missing what they're
dialog: saying!
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: ...mMost precious thing in the world.
dialog: Don't you want for my happiness?
dialog: Don't you, Millie? Don't you think
dialog: I should have Tyler's baby?
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: O£ course. Of course you should. I
dialog: want you to be so happy.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (tears glistening)
dialog: Oh, thank you, Millie. I love you
dialog: so. It'll be perfect, you'll see.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (to Bob)
dialog: Millie is the wise one in the family.
dialog: She's never wrong.
speaker_heading: HERBERT
dialog: I don't want to ruin anybody's
dialog: happiness, but there's one thing we
dialog: haven't considered...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I gotta get ready for work.
text: Millie's no longer listening. Montag drifts from the room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT - STREET/CLARISSE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: A cold breeze rattles the autumn leaves across the pavement
text: as Montag walks toward the transit station with his gym bag.
text: He slows in front of Clarisse's house, gazing over the fence
text: across the wild tangle of yard. Curious about the house and
dialog: the people who live there.
scene_heading: INT - HOUSE - UPPER FLOOR - DAY
text: Clarisse is attending home school, using'a stylus on an
text: electronic pad to do her lessons. Through the window, b.g.,
text: the tiny figure of Montag can be seen on the street.
text: Clarisse notices Montag out there, pauses the lesson.
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: EXT - STREET - DAY
text: Montag sees her appear at the window. She gives him a tentative
text: smile and a wave. Hesitant, Montag waves back.
text: Clarisse motions "wait" and disappears from view. A moment
text: later she reappears with a CAT, an orange tabby, and puts him
text: on the inner sill. Montag watches, increasingly puzzled.
text: The cat patiently endures as Clarisse puts a little red cowboy
text: hat on him with a rubber band strap, then slips his hind legs
text: into little cowboy boots. Done, Clarisse stands the kitty up
text: on its hind legs and "puppets" him in a goofy little dance.
text: The image is so absurd and unexpected, Montag can't help
text: laughing. Clarisse smiles at his reaction, happy. Softly:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Now that's just...silly.
text: She makes the cat wave goodbye. Montag walks on...
speaker_heading: CuT TO:
scene_heading: INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: -and we're plunged into a cauldron of NOISE: Firemen shouting
text: as bets are made, insults traded. DILLMAN, LANDERS, PECK,
text: ORMSBY, and a DOZEN OTHERS are clustered around six wire cages
text: on the firehouse floor, each containing a LARGE SEWER RAT.
text: Before them stands the Mechanical Hound, waiting.
text: As the men jostle and shout, Dillman raises a cage to show
text: everybody the aggressive, hissing rat within. The cage has a
text: handwritten number "3" on it.
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: Who's it gonna be? Horse number
dialog: three? Let's see some money!
speaker_heading: PECK
dialog: Look at that mean son of a bitch!
dialog: That's him, that's my bad boy!
speaker_heading: LANDERS
dialog: You're gonna lose your shirt, Peck!
speaker_heading: PECK
dialog: Fifty bucks says you can kiss my
dialog: ass!
speaker_heading: LANDERS
dialog: A bargain! Your wife charges a
dialog: hundred!
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: ORMSBY
dialog: Go on, Dillman, give it a whiff!
text: Dillman holds the cage out, letting the Mechanical Hound smell
text: the rat. To a nose as finely calibrated as the Hound's, the
text: rat's scent is as good as a DNA fingerprint. (The data appears
text: on Ormsby's plasma-screen next to "Horse #3: Peck's Bad Boy.")
speaker_heading: ORMSBY
dialog: Got it! Next!
text: Dillman dumps the rat out of the cage to join two others
text: already in the "starting gate" -- a round bottomless holding
text: pen on the floor. He reaches for the next cage while:
scene_heading: MONTAG AND BEATTY
text: sit on a cot apart from the others, speaking quietly:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Thank you for helping last night.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Thank me no thankings, nor proud me
dialog: no prouds. It's nothing.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I came close to losing her. If you
dialog: hadn't intervened...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: And how's Millie? Okay?
dialog: (Montag hesitates)
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: She won't talk about it. She won't
dialog: even admit it happened.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Maybe that's a good thing. If she
dialog: doesn't remember, I doubt she
dialog: intended to harm herself. That's
dialog: what's got you worried, yes?
dialog: (Montag nods)
dialog: She probably just lost track. It
dialog: happens. Never happened to you?
speaker_heading: . MONTAG
dialog: I don't take levelers.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Really? I never knew that. Montag,
dialog: I'm surprised at you. It's the
dialog: shortcut to bliss, haven't you seen
dialog: the ads? Everybody takes levelers.
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: (wry)
dialog: I like a little misery now and again.
dialog: (Montag laughs softly)
dialog: Ah, a smile, thank God. There's the
dialog: old Montag. I was beginning to worry.
text: Dillman dumps the last rat into the holding pen, raises his
dialog: arms to quiet the men:
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: Welcome to Rat Dome! Six rats
dialog: enter...one rat leaves! Mr. Ormsby,
dialog: program the Hound for five kills in
dialog: random order, if you please! Who
dialog: will the lucky survivor be? Final
dialog: bets, place your final bets!
dialog: (calls over)
dialog: Montag, you in?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Not tonight.
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: (offering)
dialog: And we know our dear captain never
dialog: wagers...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: I prefer sure things to guesswork.
dialog: But thank you, Mr. Dillman.
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: In that case, the betting window is
dialog: closed! Horses are at the gate!
text: A boisterous countdown begins:
speaker_heading: ALL THE MEN
scene_heading: FIVE. ..FOUR...THREE...TWO...ONE!
text: Dillman kicks the holding pen over, freeing the rats --
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: And they're off!
text: -- which scatter in all directions, men jumping and shouting
text: as rats go zipping past their feet.
text: Ormsby hits "send." The Hound's eyes go infra-red. Pandemonium
text: ensues as the Hound springs into action and streaks across
text: the firehouse like a guided missile...
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
text: ...and catches the first rat within seconds, snatching it up
text: in its jaws and shaking its chrome head so fast that the rat
text: flies apart in its teeth. (That rat's data entry turns red on
text: Ormsby's screen.) The Hound veers and goes after the next
text: rat, men running and shouting and jumping out of the way as:
scene_heading: MONTAG AND BEATTY
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: It's not just the incident last
dialog: night, is it? There's something
dialog: else troubling you.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: We don't seem to talk much at all
dialog: any more. I feel like we've drifted,
dialog: but...I don't know why. Or what to
dialog: do about it. I try.
speaker_heading: THE HOUND
text: makes another kill. Another entry on Ormsby's screen turns
text: red. The men shout like spectators at a football game.
scene_heading: MONTAG AND BEATTY
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Perhaps I can make our human
dialog: resources department available to
dialog: you. Therapy, counseling...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Those benefits are for ranking
dialog: officers only.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Well, I wasn't going to spill these
dialog: beans just yet...
speaker_heading: THE HOUND
text: kills another rat, veers after the next.
scene_heading: MONTAG AND BEATTY
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: ++. but I've decided to nominate
dialog: you as my replacement when I retire.
dialog: That means promotion. Captain Montag,
dialog: how does that sound? I'll suggest
dialog: they advance you some of those
dialog: benefits. With your record, and
dialog: your promising future, I'm sure DHS
dialog: will see things my way.
text: Montag is blown away by this news. Beatty leans in.
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: You're special, Montag. Command
dialog: caliber. That makes you a deeply
dialog: valuable asset to this department.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I don't know what to say.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Someday, my boy, all this will be
dialog: yours. Including the rats...
dialog: (his gaze shifts)
dialog: .--oh, hell.
text: A rat zips under their cot, the Hound in pursuit. They leap
text: to their feet as the Hound barrels between them, sending the
text: cot spinning into the air to the delighted howls of the men.
text: We hear a SQUEAL as the fifth rat is killed. Its data entry
text: goes red, leaving one. The Hound pauses, awaiting further
text: instructions. Amidst the jeers and laughter:
speaker_heading: ORMSBY
dialog: Too bad, Peck. That was your bad
dialog: boy.
text: Peck bends down and sees the sixth and final rat pressed
text: against the wall under a desk, panting in terror.
speaker_heading: LANDERS
dialog: And the winner is?
speaker_heading: ORMSBY
text: Horse #2, "Dillman's Delight."
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: Ohhh, what a heartbreak! Sorry,
dialog: boys, fork it over! I hate to say
dialog: it, but I am the winnaahh...
speaker_heading: PECK
dialog: Take your money and shut your pie-
dialog: hole, Dillman.
text: Suddenly, the ALARM SOUNDS. The men react, scattering as:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Gentlemen, fun's over! Kindly dispose
dialog: of the winner.
text: Ormsby quickly enters a kill command. The Hound bounds across
text: the floor and pounces on the last SHRIEKING rat as we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: EXT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: HUGE DOORS slide open, revealing the Salamander in a glare of

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A three-story Victorian relic stands like a ghost from another

text: from their shanty towns, drawn by the promise of a fire.
text: Firemen jump down from the truck, marching across the stretch
text: of dead lawn past a PAIR OF STONE LIONS. This house might
dialog: have been a library once, a few hundred years ago.
text: The battering rams are readied as the men take positions at
text: the door. Beatty knocks. For a moment there's nothing. Beatty
text: is about to motion them to break the door down, but then:
text: A face appears at the window, ethereal and beautiful. It's an
text: OLD WOMAN, her eyes luminous, her skin like worn silk.
text: She motions for Beatty to be patient. The face withdraws. A
text: few seconds pass. We hear the door UNLOCKING from inside.
text: It opens, revealing the old woman. Her smile is enigmatic, as
text: if she's merely receiving visitors.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Madam. We have a warrant.
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Of course you do. Everything all
dialog: nice and legal and proper. Nobody's
dialog: rights shall be violated this
dialog: evening, I'm sure.
dialog: (swings the door wider)
dialog: Please do come in. Mind you wipe
dialog: your feet.
text: Montag and the others are trading glances. This is different.
scene_heading: INT - ENTRYWAY OF HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The firemen enter and spread out a bit, gazing up. We're in a
text: grand entry foyer that soars three stories up, surrounded on
text: all sides by landings. The staircase railings are carved wood,
text: the lighting is Tiffany stained glass, the furnishings are as
text: ancient as the house. A grandfather clock TICKS SOFTLY.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: I've been expecting you.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Have you indeed?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: For many years. I've often tried to
dialog: imagine your face. Now I know.
text: Beatty raises his plasma-screen clipboard.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: You may call me Mrs. Havisham, if
dialog: that pleases you. And I might call
dialog: you Pip. Yes, that might be quite
dialog: amusing.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Don't insult my intelligence. You
dialog: know my name.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: (checks his screen)
dialog: Mrs. Roland. I am Captain Beatty.
dialog: We've received an anonymous tip...
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Is there any other kind?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: ...which empowers us by law to
dialog: conduct a search for books.
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: And you shall find them, I'm sure.
text: In the walls. The attic. Under the
dialog: floors. Don't forget to check the
text: cupboards.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
text: Montag. Have the men proceed, and
dialog: see the lady out.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Five teams of three! Carillo, Peck,
dialog: first and second floors! Dillman,
dialog: third! Landers, basement! Ormsby,
dialog: attic! Go!
text: The teams split up, double-timing. The old woman watches them
text: go. Montag offers his hand to escort her out.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Ma'am? Please come with me.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: I most certainly will not. Nor may
dialog: you coerce me. Isn't that right,
dialog: Captain?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Dear lady, let's have no foolishness.
dialog: Accompany the fireman, he'll see
dialog: you safely out. Please don't make
dialog: me insist.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Insist all you like. I am perfectly
dialog: within my legal rights, as you well
dialog: know.
text: Montag throws Beatty a puzzled look. Beatty gives the old
text: woman an appraising look, motions Montag to wait.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: According to whom?
text: She pulls a book from her pocket, paging through it.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Your own Homeland Security manual.
dialog: One of the few books not on the
dialog: burning list. I've read it many
dialog: times with great interest, especially
dialog: the section on your department.
dialog: (pauses to read)
dialog: "The fire department was established
dialog: in 1790 to burn English-influenced
speaker_heading: ° (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: books in the Colonies. The first
dialog: fireman: Benjamin Franklin." Oh, I
dialog: do so love history.
dialog: (keeps paging)
dialog: Let's see. Ah, here it is. I have
dialog: it marked. Chapter twelve, subsection
dialog: four. According to the Supreme Court
dialog: decision granting the government
dialog: full authority as regards the burning
dialog: of books for purposes of national
dialog: security, the accused -- that would
dialog: be me -- has the right to remain
text: present and bear full witness.
text: She closes the book and tucks it away.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: That's an extremely obscure and
dialog: seldom-invoked right .
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Nevertheless, I invoke it.
dialog: {off Beatty's look)
dialog: They're your rules. You must abide
dialog: by them.
text: A moment of stand-off. Beatty gazing at the woman. The woman
text: unflinching. Montag uncertain, caught between them.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Montag. Scan the lady, if you please.
text: Montag pulls his x-ray wand, running it up and down the woman's
text: body. Beatty clicks his comlink...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Control?
scene_heading: INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
text: -..and we see x-ray images coming over the monitors -- bones,
text: veins, swirls of cloth. The computers give readouts and

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY

dialog: then, Fireman Montag will remain at

speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: That is satisfactory.
text: Montag shakes his head -- this is crazy. Beatty glances up as
text: a VOICE comes over his comlink:
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Cap! You're not gonna believe this...
speaker_heading: THIRD FLOOR
text: Dillman and his team are sweeping the hallway walls with their
text: wands, mouths agape, the ghostly x-ray images revealing:
text: Books. And more books. Endless rows of them within the walls.
scene_heading: INT - CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
text: The controllers are watching, amazed. The monitors show x-ray
text: images of books everywhere throughout the house. Softly:
speaker_heading: CONTROLLER #2
dialog: Holy Christ. Look at ‘em all.
scene_heading: INT - HOUSE/GRAND ENTRYWAY - NIGHT
text: Dillman appears at the third floor railing above.
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: They're everywhere. The whole

speaker_heading: LANDER'S VOICE

dialog: Landers, sir, confirming that. Must

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Get on with it.
text: AXES AND CHAINSAWS rip the walls...
text: CEILINGS are torn open with long pikes...
text: FLOORBOARDS are sundered with pry bars...
text: SHELVES are overturned, furniture smashed...
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: AN ANGLE
text: replays the opening image of our film:
text: In SLO-MO, an object falls through frame -- a book. Rolling,
text: tumbling, dropping from sight.
text: Another book. And another. Books falling. And soon:
text: Raining. It's raining books. ANGLE TILTS DOWN to reveal the
text: old woman watching the books falling all around her. She turns
text: to Montag, meets his gaze. Softly:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Why do you want to see this?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: They're my books.
text: Montag catches a book as it falls, looks up to see:
speaker_heading: FIREMEN
text: throwing armloads of books over the railings. They rain down,
text: cascading, fluttering like birds. Montag takes the old woman
text: by the elbow, guides her gently to a safer position...
scene_heading: EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: ..-while the Scooper dumps another load of books onto the
text: beacon and backs away...
scene_heading: INT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: ..-.and boots come pounding as firemen enter with kerosene
text: pumpers on their backs, fanning out.
text: ANGLE SHIFTS TO Montag watching the old woman. She's taking
text: it all in, her expression inscrutable...
text: All around them, throughout the house, firemen soak the walls,
text: the heaps of books, priming the house like a bomb...
text: The fumes are getting thick. Montag snaps his breather mask
text: over his face, takes a few deep breaths. He pulls the mask
text: away, offers it to the woman.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: No thank you.
text: She pulls a handkerchief, holds it over her nose and mouth.
text: A few firemen are gathering at Beatty's side, pumpers empty.
text: Montag, cued by a look from Beatty, clicks his comlink:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Gentlemen, wrap it up.
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: UPPER FLOOR
text: Dillman's pumper goes dry. He motions "let's go" to the others
text: as he clicks his comlink:
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: We're done here! Heading down now!
speaker_heading: ENTRYWAY
text: Beatty turns to the old woman:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
text: The flamethrowers are next. It's
dialog: time to leave.
text: She meets his gaze, her eyes watering from the fumes.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: You can't ever have my books.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Books aren't real. Only the law is
dialog: real. Come on now.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: I'd rather stay.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: You know I can't allow that. Suicide
dialog: is also against the law.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Ma'am. This whole house is gonna go
dialog: up. Come on. I'll walk you out.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: No.
scene_heading: . CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: I'm counting to ten. If you don't
dialog: leave, my men will pick you up and

speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: It'll be okay. Just come with me.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY

speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Thank you anyway.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY

speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Go on. I'll be fine.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: ...seven...eight...
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: .-Shut the gate...
text: She reaches up, undoing her bun. Her hair unravels as she
text: pulls a small, slender object from it...
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: ..-nine...ten...
text: ...and she holds the object out toward them...
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: ..a big fat hen.

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: {calm, steely)
dialog: Gentlemen, you heard the order.
dialog: Evacuate.
text: The others rush out, but Montag stays. He and Beatty keep
text: backing slowly toward the door as:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Allow me to appeal to your reason.
dialog: Where's the sense in this?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Where's the sense in anything? The
text: world's gone upside down.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: The world is fine, it's your mind
dialog: that's upside down. See what those
dialog: books have done to you?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Ma'am. This is crazy. You don't
dialog: want to do this.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: This is my home. And these are my
dialog: books. Get out. Now.
dialog: (as they hesitate)
dialog: GET THE HELL OUT!
text: Montag and Beatty back out the door...
scene_heading: INT/EXT - ENTRYWAY/PORCH - NIGHT
text: ...onto the front porch. A VOICE comes over Beatty's comlink:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: The police have a sniper! Should we
dialog: take her out?
text: Beatty throws Montag a long-suffering look, clicks his comlink.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: That would defeat the purpose now,
dialog: wouldn't it? I'm certain Mrs. Roland
dialog: will see reason, once she's had a
dialog: chance to think it through. Isn't
dialog: that right, dear?
text: The old woman turns away, walking back to the center of the
text: xoom, gazing around at the wreckage, the piles of books. Montag
text: tries to go back inside to grab her, but Beatty puts a
text: restraining hand on his arm.
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Mrs. Roland? You've made your point.
dialog: Given everyone a good scare. Well
dialog: done. Time to come out now.
text: She turns, facing them. A long look passes between them as
text: her thumbnail tightens on the match head...
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Play the man, Master Ridley; we
dialog: shall this day light such a candle,
dialog: by God's grace, in England, as I
dialog: trust shall never be put out.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: Don't.
text: ---and her thumbnail scrapes the sulfur tip, FLARING it to
text: life. Montag's eyes widen in horror --
text: -- and the match flare leaps into the air, a heartbeat of
text: white-hot ignition, the air rippling as it catches fire. For
text: a moment the old woman is surrounded by an aura of flame
text: swirling about her, lifting her hair and catching it afire,
text: making her eyes glow like coals --
text: -- and BOOOOM! The entryway EXPLODES, shattering windows, a
text: HUGE FIST OF FLAME punching through the front door and blowing
text: Beatty and Montag right off their feet, hurling them over the
text: railings and onto the lawn in a storm of debris. Some other
text: firemen are caught on the run, also blown off their feet...
scene_heading: INT - HOUSE - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT
text: A firestorm surges up the stairs...races along the
text: walls...engulfing room after room...shattering the grandfather
text: clock with heat...consuming piles of books...
scene_heading: EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Montag pries his face off the lawn, sees Beatty sitting up

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Did everybody get out?
speaker_heading: CONTROLLER #1
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: All links are active! Everybody's

text: Montag turns, gazing at the house through a pall of smoke and
text: swirling embers, and sees:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR
text: An inferno within. A FIGURE appears in the flames. A burning

text: Then gone in a rush of flame.
text: PUSH IN ON MONTAG
text: staring in horror.
speaker_heading: FIREMEN
text: come running against a backdrop of flames, pulling Beatty and

text: Riding back to the firehouse. Faces grim.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Gear is being cleaned and stowed. The mood is subdued, quiet.
text: Montag backs the Scooper off the firetruck, parks it. As he
text: gets off, Beatty enters and activity comes to a standstill.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Most of you have never seen a
dialog: suicide. They were far more common
dialog: in the old days. Just understand
dialog: there is no accounting for unstable
dialog: minds. You all followed protocol
dialog: and did your jobs well. Nobody here
dialog: is to blame.
text: Glances are traded. Nobody feels good about what happened
dialog: tonight. Softly:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I missed it. The match. When I
dialog: scanned her.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Then it's your fault? I see. Or is it
dialog: mine, for failing to instruct you to
dialog: scan her hair? I was officer in charge,
dialog: after all. Blame, if any, lies with
dialog: me. My report will say so. But Montag.
dialog: I was not the old woman who stood in
text: a house primed with kerosene and chose
dialog: to light a match. Nor were you. Nor

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY (CONT'D)
dialog: were any of us. That act of insanity
dialog: lies solely with her. Yes?
text: Montag nods. Beatty motions to the group.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Let's put it behind us. That gear
dialog: isn't going to stow itself, is it?
text: The men disperse, activity resuming as:
speaker_heading: PECK
dialog: (grumbling)
dialog: I dunno what we're all twisted up
dialog: over. Stupid old bitch could'a got
dialog: us all killed. I'm glad she burned.
speaker_heading: LANDERS
dialog: Leave it alone, Peck. Give us a

speaker_heading: MONTAG

speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I still have to recharge the fuel

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: No. I mean, blaming yourself. All

text: Montag hesitates, nods. Beatty starts to move off, but:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Master Ridley. That crazy thing she
dialog: said. Play the game, something,
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: "Play the man, Master Ridley. We
dialog: shall this day light such a candle,
dialog: by God's grace, in England, as I
dialog: trust shall never be put out."
text: Some firemen nearby pause, startled.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: A man named Latimer said that to a
dialog: man named Nicholas Ridley as they
dialog: were being burnt alive at Oxford,
dialog: for heresy, in 1555.
dialog: (off their looks)
dialog: Oh, I'm full of bits and pieces.
dialog: Most fire captains are, after doing
dialog: it enough years. The nonsense sticks
dialog: to your boots like chewing gum.
dialog: (to Montag)
dialog: But nonsense is all it is. Romantic,
dialog: foolish notions that appeal to feeble
dialog: minds and justify idiot behavior
dialog: such as suicide.
dialog: (leans in, softly)
dialog: Go home, Montag. Hug your wife.
text: Beatty departs. Montag moves to the front of the Scooper to
dialog: connect the hydrogen fuel hose...
text: ---and stops. There, lying in the scoop blade, are TWO BOOKS
dialog: that _got left behind when the last load was dumped.
speaker_heading: ORMSBY
dialog: . (suddenly appears)
dialog: Need help?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Um...no. Got it. Thanks.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
text: -.,and we find Montag sitting before his locker after a shower,
text: toweling his hair. He looks numb. The place is emptying, locker
text: doors shutting, voices drifting off, firemen heading home.
text: He becomes aware of Dillman down the row, lacing his boots. A
text: look passes between them. It's clear both men are stunned,
text: deeply shaken. Softly, so only Montag can hear:
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: I can't get it out of my head. You?
text: Montag shakes his head. No, he can't. Almost embarrassed,
text: Dillman grabs his gym bag and leaves.
text: Montag is left alone. He rises to his locker, lifts his
text: fireman's necklace from its peg, drapes it around his neck.
speaker_heading: CuT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Montag slides down the brass pole, moves through the shadows
text: past the Salamander. This part of the firehouse is deserted.
text: MUFFLED VOICES can be heard from the floor above, followed by
text: occasional bursts of raucous laughter.
text: Montag's drawn inexorably to the Scooper. He stops, peers
text: into the scooper blade, sees the two books lying in shadow.
text: He's frozen, unsure. He reaches in and pulls one out. It's
text: "Charlie the Choo Choo," by Beryl Evans. A children's book.
text: He pulls out the other one. "Lord of the Flies," by William
dialog: Golding. Neither title means anything to him, but the books
text: themselves have him transfixed.
text: Quickly, before he can change his mind, he shoves the books
text: into his gym bag, heads for the exit...
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: ---and as he rounds the corner, comes face to face with the
text: Mechanical Hound. The beast is lying there, head resting on
text: its paws. Montag freezes.
text: The Hound raises its head, looking like an exotic chromed
text: Sphinx. Its glowing red eyes abruptly dilate wider with a
text: soft WHIRRR. To Montag's astonishment, a LOW GROWL builds in
text: the Hound's throat.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Easy, boy. Easy now.
text: Montag takes a nervous step back. The Hound rises and comes
text: forward, sniffing the air...
text: Its titanium jaws open, gleaming. The hypodermic tongue
text: distends, slowly at first, then flicking forward and back,
text: forward and back -- snap, snap, snap! A drop of amber fluid
text: flies off the needle tip, hits the floor.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: sit. Goddamn it, I said sit.
text: The Hound hesitates, backs off. Its haunches lower and the
text: beast lies back down, but remains coiled like a spring.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Good boy. Stay. Stay.
text: The Hound stays. Montag circles past it, out the door...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: EXT - TRANSIT STATION PLATFORM - NIGHT
text: The latest war news is playing on the VID SCREENS. Images of

text: land. Muzzle blasts. Explosions. Stirring theme music.
text: PAN TO Montag waiting for his train. A PAIR OF BEAT COPS in
text: their urban armor are crossing the platform toward him. They

dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT - MOVING MAG-LEV TRAIN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: cuT To:
scene_heading: EXT - MONTAG'S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
text: Montag walks home, gym bag in hand.
text: In the far b.g., a POLICE CAR appears, cruising slowly into
text: the intersection. Montag glances back and keeps walking,
text: praying the car will continue on through the intersection.
text: But no, the police car turns, coming this way. Montag keeps
text: walking, slowly, forcing himself to appear nonchalant. But
text: the moment he turns the corner...
text: THE NEXT STREET
text: ..-he breaks into a full run. Feet pounding the pavement, gym
text: bag flying at his side.
text: He drops the gym bag. Shit! He skids to a stop, grabs it,
text: goes darting down the next intersecting street.
text: A moment later, the police car appears around the corner. The
text: pedestrian they were tailing is gone. The car accelerates
text: toward us, LIGHTS FLASHING...
text: THE NEXT STREET
text: ..as Montag comes running, hearing the police car racing up
text: toward the intersection behind him.
text: He dives for cover behind some trash cans lining the sidewalk,
text: squeezing into the shadows between the cans and a fence.
text: The police car swerves into view around the corner. Slowing.
text: SPOTLIGHTS blaze to life as the vehicle comes creeping up the
text: street toward us, probing the shadows.
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON MONTAG
text: as the lights grow brighter, nearer. He's gasping to catch
text: his breath. Suddenly:
speaker_heading: CLARISSE (0.S.)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Don't breathe so loud. They have
text: microphones.
text: Montag turns his head. The fence he's squeezed up against is
text: Clarisse's. He can see her eyes through the cracks in the
text: boards -- she's crouched on the other side.
text: The car draws parallel with them, the dazzling glare of the
text: spotlight probing from the other side of the trash cans.
text: The car stops. Faint, ghostly RADIO CHATTER spills into the
text: night. We hear murmurs:
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: I got sound and motion. Something
dialog: back there.
text: Montag's frozen, trying not to move or breathe. Suddenly,
text: from the other side of the fence comes a MEOW. Clarisse's cat
text: skitters along the fence in the shadows.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: Goddamn cat.
text: The car moves on, spotlight plying the shadows. Montag watches
text: it disappear down the street. In whispers:
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: Why are you hiding?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I did something tonight. Something
dialog: very stupid.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I took some books.
text: No response at first. He shifts his head so he can see her
text: more clearly through the slats in the fence. She's watching
text: him, her face like a porcelain doll's in the moonlight .
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: Did you? Did you really?
dialog: 
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: It was stupid. I shouldn't have
dialog: done it. And I shouldn't have run
dialog: ‘just now. I'ma fireman, they
dialog: wouldn't have searched me. I'm not
dialog: thinking clearly. I have to think.
text: He hugs the gym bag to his chest, mind racing.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: Are you scared?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I'll just give them back. Better
dialog: yet, burn them. That's right, that's
dialog: what I should do. Just tear out the
dialog: pages and burn them myself.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: Yes. That would probably be best.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Can I see them?
text: He hesitates, opens the gym bag, pulls out the books. She
text: reaches through the slats, fingertips brushing the covers.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: "Charlie the Choo Choo." ,
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: If they ever found out...if they
dialog: knew I had them...
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: I won't tell.
text: Montag's shocked. Her words, so simple, have unlocked a
text: door...as if she, of all people, had given him permission.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You won't?
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: Not anybody. Not ever.
text: He peers at her through the slats.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Really?
text: She nods, her expression grave. Montag doesn't know what to
text: say. He looks down at the books, makes a decision.
text: He eases "Charlie the Choo Choo" through the slats. Clarisse's
text: breath catches in her throat. She takes the book, almost afraid
text: to touch it. She looks to him, unable to believe it.
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Make sure nobody finds that. I mean
dialog: ever, ever. Okay?
text: She draws the book toward her, but hesitates.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: It's not a trick, is it? You won't
dialog: come and burn our house, will you?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: No. I won't. I promise.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Clarisse. I'm really glad you're my
dialog: friend. Really glad. Okay?
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: Okay.
text: And then she's gone, off into the shadows. Montag shoves "Lord
text: of the Flies" back in his bag, leaves his hiding place...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Millie's asleep in the dark. Montag eases onto the bed, still
text: fully dressed, spoons up next to her. He's uncertain, scared,
text: needing to hold her. She stirs, groggy, half-asleep, as:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: We burned a woman tonight.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: You...what? You did what?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: An old woman. She had a match. We
text: didn't see it until it was too late.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: So...she killed herself. She was
text: crazy. A crazy old woman.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Yeah, I guess that's right. A crazy
dialog: old woman.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: You had me confused.
dialog: (rolls away)
dialog: Poor Guy. You must be tired. Try
dialog: and get some sleep.
text: She drifts off. Montag holds her a while, then eases to his
text: side of the bed, mind going a mile-a-minute.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: THE BATHROOM
text: Montag enters, locks the door. He pulls "Lord of the Flies"
text: from his gym bag, examining it with fascination. He opens it,
text: riffles the pages.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Paper. Ink. Words. So what?
text: He sits, using the toilet for a chair, starts reading the
dialog: very first page as we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT - BATHROOM - DAY
text: The ANGLE hasn't changed, but we find Montag sprawled on the
text: floor in an exhausted sleep, the book lying nearby.
text: Sudden POUNDING wrenches him awake. Millie" s muffled VOICE is
text: heard through the door:
speaker_heading: MILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: Guy, answer me! Are you all right
dialog: in there?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Wha--yeah...yeah, m'all right...
text: He sits up, trying to get his bearings, reeling from being
text: jolted from a deep sleep.
speaker_heading: MILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: What are you doing in there? Open
dialog: the door!
text: His eyes focus, remembering where he is, sees the book lying
text: on the floor. He grabs it and rises, fighting panic.
speaker_heading: MONTAG .
dialog: Uh-huh, 'kay, just a minute...
speaker_heading: MILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: No, now! I mean it! You've been in
dialog: there all morning! You got me worried
dialog: sick...and I have to pee!
text: He jams the book in his waistband, hides it with his untucked
text: shirt. A quick glance in the mirror -- yup, he looks like
text: hell. He opens the door. Millie muscles past him and makes a
text: beeline for the toilet, sitting to pee.
text: IN THE HALLWAY
text: -+-as Montag moves into the hallway, heart still pounding.
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: MILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: Were you in here all night?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Yeah. Sorry. I was throwing up.
dialog: I've come down with something.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Would you call Captain Beatty and
dialog: tell him I'm not coming in?
text: The DOORBELL RINGS. He starts up the hallway to answer it.
speaker_heading: MILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: You can tell him yourself. That's
dialog: probably him.
text: ..-and he stops in his tracks, fully awake now, staring at
text: the front door.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: What?
text: We hear the TOILET FLUSH. Millie exits the bathroom, sees
text: Montag standing there. The DOORBELL RINGS again.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: He called twice this morning, said
dialog: he was coming over. You gonna answer
dialog: it?
text: He turns, pushes past her toward the bedroom.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: No. Tell him I'm sick. Tell him to
dialog: go away.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: What? I can't tell him that! He's
dialog: your boss!
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Tell him I'm in bed! I've got chills!
dialog: Fever! Just do it!
text: Off her stunned look, he enters --
speaker_heading: THE BEDROOM
text: -- where he pulls the book and shoves it under his pillow.
text: He glances through the half-open bedroom door as he peels off
text: his clothes. He can see Millie at the far end of the hallway
text: b.g., talking to Beatty at the front door.
text: She brings him this way. Montag jumps into bed. Moments later,
text: Beatty enters, trailed tentatively by Millie.
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Sorry to hear you're sick.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I wanted to call. Ask for the night
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: By all means, take it. Your health
dialog: is important.
text: Beatty pulls up a chair, sits at bedside, eyeing Montag.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Mrs. Montag. Do take good care of
dialog: our boy. Lots of rest, lots of
dialog: fluids. We want him hale and hearty.
text: She circles the bed, playing the good wife, putting on a show
text: of making Montag more comfortable, straightening the bedding...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: That's fine, honey, thanks.
text: ..-but she keeps on fussing, cowed by Beatty's presence as:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: I was worried about you. You and
dialog: Dillman. You two seemed to take it
dialog: the hardest. You know, he didn't go
dialog: home last night.
text: Montag's distracted and edgy -- now Millie's fluffing the
dialog: damn pillows.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Honey, it's fine, okay? Dillman?
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: He's gone missing. His wife says he
dialog: never showed up.
dialog: (off Montag's look)
dialog: We've notified the police. I do
dialog: hope he's okay.
text: Montag's getting panicky as Millie tries to get at his pillow
dialog: to fluff it...
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Honey, move your shoulder.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie, leave it! It's fine!
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
text: ...and she suddenly freezes, hand under his pillow, shock
text: creeping into her face. She can feel the book. Quietly:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Honey, the pillow's fine. We're
dialog: talking. Please stop fussing.
text: She pulls her hand away, face slack, trying not to betray
text: anything. Beatty's watching them both as:
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Okay. How about some tea?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: That'd be great.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Captain? For you?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Splendid, thank you.
text: She moves stiffly to the door and exits. Beatty seems to stare
dialog: right through Montag, then:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: I know what's going on.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
text: Some firemen see a woman burn and
dialog: think, "well, that happened." They
dialog: go home, have dinner, show up for
dialog: work the next day. It's not so easy
dialog: for others. Some firemen can hit a
text: snag from time to time. A crisis.
text: Doubts. Questions. It's ingrained
dialog: in the job. That's why I'm here, to
dialog: help you through it, if I can.
scene_heading: INT - TV ROOM - DAY
text: Beatty slots his security card into the TV port.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Request clearance for private uplink.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: State name, rank, and division for
text: voice recognition.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Beatty, Tiberius, fire captain,
dialog: Phoenix Division.
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Uplink approved. Stand by.
text: Beatty motions for Montag to sit. Montag, in his robe, takes
text: center seat. Beatty remains standing.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Where did it begin, you ask, this
dialog: thing we do? How did it start?
text: The TV room comes to life. We're surrounded by images, Montag
text: and Beatty seemingly transported into the events on screen:
dialog: Book burnings. Many of these images were once black & white,
text: but have since been digitally enhanced and colorized.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: They used to teach this stuff in
dialog: the Academy. Gave the rookies a
dialog: good grounding in fundamentals. Not
dialog: so much anymore. Shame.
dialog: As they watch:
text: Bolsheviks burn decadent capitalist literature.
text: The Nazi faithful hurl armloads of books onto raging bonfires,
text: sending geysers of embers swirling into the air.
text: Southern Baptists torch truckloads of Elvis and Beatles
text: records, spicing the mix with armloads of "Catcher in the
text: Rye," "Slaughterhouse Five," "Lolita."
text: A veritable orgy of flame. Vonnegut. Wilde. Bradbury. Rowling.
text: Ellison. Shelley. Shaw. Heretics being burned at the stake.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON MONTAG
text: gazing straight ahead. The images surround him on all sides,
text: flames flickering across his face and tattooing pinpoints of
text: fire into his eyes. From Montag's face, WE BOOM UP TO:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: It's nothing new, Montag, what we do.
dialog: Admittedly, in the past, it's been
text: unfocused. Haphazard. Disharmonious.
dialog: Various special interest groups trying
dialog: to get the better of other special
dialog: interest groups whose special interests
dialog: they disapproved of. Opinions flying
text: like hand grenades. Books wielded
text: like stone clubs to smash one another
text: over the head with. Pundits flinging
dialog: their precious thoughts like apes
text: flinging feces through the bars of a
dialog: cage.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
text: Dizzying images of mass rallies. Stalin. Hitler.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Every so often a book would come
dialog: along and turn the world on its
dialog: ear. Marx and his manifesto. Hitler
dialog: and his Kampf. Before you know it,
dialog: it wasn't just books being burned.
dialog: It was people. Not just a crazy old
text: woman with a kitchen match, but by
text: the millions. Entire cities.
dialog: (to the TV)
dialog: Show me London. Dresden. Tokyo.
text: Click, click, click -- images of cities being consumed in
text: massive firebombings.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Hiroshima. Nagasaki.
text: Mushroom clouds suddenly rise before Montag's eyes like suns
text: being born. Beatty's pacing, watching, circling Montag.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Books are dangerous, Montag. Lethal
text: in their power. The book burners
dialog: had the right idea, of course, but
dialog: they never burned right. They burned
dialog: to prove some selfish point, not
dialog: for the greater goal of harmony and
dialog: the good of mankind. And then...then
dialog: came the start of this century. And
text: the beginning of clarity.
text: Images of 9-11 are shocking in their ferocity. The Twin Towers
dialog: burn, tumble, collapse...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Books were fine once upon a time, back
dialog: when there was plenty of room, in the
dialog: days of horse and cart. But the world
dialog: became far too vast, too complex, too
dialog: dangerous. Our agendas could no longer
dialog: conflict, not if we were to survive.
dialog: Pulling together for a common goal,
dialog: that's what was required. Books and
dialog: divisive philosophies need not apply.
dialog: I won't stomach them for a moment, nor
dialog: should you. The stakes were, and are,
dialog: far too great.
text: Millie enters with tea. Beatty takes a cup. The screens depict
text: increasingly futuristic forms of warfare in a wide variety of
text: lands. Floating hovertanks. Smarter and smarter bombs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Peace, Montag. Harmony, Montag.
dialog: Security, Montag. Happiness.
dialog: (to Millie)
dialog: That's what everyone wants, isn't
dialog: it, dear? Haven't you heard it all
dialog: your life? I want to be happy, people
dialog: say. Don't you? Doesn't everyone?
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Yes. Yes, they do. I'm...I'm happy.
text: Flustered, Millie offers the tea tray to Montag. He takes his
text: cup and she hurries out.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: That's us, Montag. The Happiness
dialog: Twins. The Dixie Duo, you and I. We
dialog: stand against those who want everyone
dialog: unhappy and divided. I don't think
dialog: you realize how important you are
dialog: to the survival of our society.
dialog: Recite the first two articles of
text: faith from the fireman's manual.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: "One, books erode the fundamental
dialog: precept of our democracy, which is
dialog: that all men are created equal. Two,
text: books are a reflection of one man's
dialog: ego, and thus by their very nature
dialog: are antisocial and combative."
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: My God's better than your God. My
dialog: morality is superior to yours. I
dialog: disapprove of your life, your
dialog: choices, your culture, your politics,
dialog: your smell. A book is a loaded gun
dialog: in the house next door. So? Into
text: the incinerator with it. All men
dialog: made equal. All men made happy.
dialog: Blacks don't like "Little Black
dialog: Sambo?" Burn it. Whites are ashamed
text: of "Uncle Tom's Cabin?" Scorch it.
dialog: "Johnny Got His Gun" demoralizing
dialog: our troops and hindering the war
dialog: effort? Render its ashes unto Caesar,
dialog: lest the empire fall.
dialog: (sits, faces Montag)
dialog: We've been at war since before you
dialog: and I were born. You did your
dialog: military service as required, and
dialog: with distinction. So did I. So must
dialog: we all do our parts -- no ifs, ands,
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY (CONT'D)
dialog: or maybes -- or we shall lose
dialog: someday. Our country, our people,
dialog: our way of life -- that's what's at
dialog: stake.
dialog: (to the room)
dialog: Enough.
text: The screens go dark, silent. Beatty pulls out his lighter,
text: flicks it on-off, on-off. Admiring the flame. He looks at
text: Montag with a twinkle in his eye.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Tell you a little secret. I've read
dialog: a few books in my day. I had doubts,
dialog: too, as a younger man. Questions. I
dialog: had to know what I was about.
text: He draws a cigar from his inner pocket, applies the flame.
text: He puffs the
text: Montag nods.
dialog: Beatty rises
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: And the more I read, the more I did
dialog: know. I came to know the face of my
dialog: enemy and the truth of my calling.
dialog: Books, dear Montag, say nothing.
dialog: They're good for one thing. The
dialog: application of heat. Four hundred
dialog: and fifty one degrees Fahrenheit, to
dialog: be precise.
dialog: cigar to life.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: So...if a fireman were to...
dialog: accidentally...not really intending
dialog: anything...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Take a book home?
text: His mouth is dry.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: A natural error. Curiosity alone.
dialog: We don't get anxious or mad. We let
dialog: the fireman keep the book for a day
dialog: or two. If he hasn't burned it by
dialog: then, well...we simply come and
dialog: burn it for him.
dialog: (off Montag's look)
text: Fire is bright, and fire is clean.
dialog: Feel better, my boy. I hope to see
dialog: you back before too long.
text: and exits past Millie hovering in the doorway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Thank you for the tea.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Bye.
text: They stay frozen: Montag in the chair, Millie in the doorway.
text: They listen as Beatty goes to the front door and exits.
text: Montag turns, looks to Millie. She's seething.
speaker_heading: : MILLIE
dialog: Goddamn you.
text: She darts from view toward the bedroom. Everything that follows
dialog: is HANDHELD, continuous:
text: Montag jumps up, out of the TV room, down the hallway, into
text: the bedroom, where Millie's ripping the bedding away, hurling
text: it to the floor, grabbing the book, colliding with Montag as
text: he tries to calm her, but she's beyond that, hysterical...
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Are you crazy? Are you insane? What
dialog: is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie, please, listen--
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Get away from me!
text: ..and she's up the hallway, into the bathroom, slams the
text: door in his face. WE HOLD ON Montag in the hallway as:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie!
speaker_heading: MILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: Leave me alone!
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: What are you doing in there?
speaker_heading: MILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: Not listening to you! Go away!
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (beat, trying to be calm)
dialog: Millie. Honey. Please don't hurt
dialog: the book.
speaker_heading: MILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: You bastard! I'm burning it!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You're what?
speaker_heading: MILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: I got a lighter from the kitchen!
dialog: I'm burning it!
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie, don't! I mean it!
dialog: (pounds on the door)
dialog: Millie!
text: No response. Montag backs up a step and delivers a brutal
text: kick. The door bursts open, lock splintering the jamb.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS into the bathroom, jarring and chaotic, Millie
text: at the sink, stunned and fearful, book blazing up in her hand.
text: He snatches the flaming book from her, slaps the flame out.
text: Montag's clenched, furious, tightly reined. We've never seen
text: him pissed before, but it looks like he could do some damage.
text: He pulls off the charred dustjacket, flings it.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You call this a burn? It's a joke.
dialog: Kerosene and a flamethrower. That's
dialog: how you burn.
dialog: (riffling pages)
dialog: Or rip 'em out and burn 'em one by
dialog: one. That what you want? Is it?
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Yes! That's what I want!
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS Montag from the bathroom, down the hallway...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: ‘kay, fine, but it's not the only
dialog: thing we should burn around here.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: (at his heels)
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: If we're gonna burn, let's do it
dialog: right! Start with that room, those
dialog: goddamn talking walls!
text: ..-and into the TV room, trailed by Millie.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Listen to you, you're not making
dialog: sense! It's that book that's done
dialog: it to you, that book...it's not
dialog: real! Books aren't real!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (indicates room)
dialog: And this is?
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: It is! It's got light, and sound,
text: and people laughing and talking and
dialog: saying my name...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I_say your name, Millie. I say it
dialog: all the time. Do you hear it? or
dialog: just the goddamn "people" in the
dialog: walls? Them, your "family."
dialog: (closing on her)
dialog: Do they love you, Millie? Do they
dialog: hold you at night and listen to you
dialog: sleep? Do they lie awake and worry
dialog: about how many pills you took, is
dialog: that why they say your name?
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: OR IS IT BECAUSE YOUR NAME'S
text: PROGRAMMED INTO OUR GODDAMN TV?
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: (crying, helpless)
dialog: I don't know what you want from me! I
dialog: don't know what's happening to you!
text: Montag pauses, calming, getting a grip. His own rage has
text: stunned him, left him shaking.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You weren't there. You didn't see ‘
dialog: her. The woman we burned.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: The crazy woman?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: She didn't seem crazy.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: She was! And she's made you crazy
dialog: too, with this, this thing...
text: She grabs the book from his hands. He stares at it, emotions
text: teetering and torn.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Did you read this?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Last night. The whole thing.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MONTAG (CONT'D)
dialog: (off her shock)
dialog: I...didn't understand it. I mean,
dialog: it seemed simple enough, but...1I
dialog: couldn't figure out the reason for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: There isn't one! Captain Beatty was
dialog: right! There's nothing in it! Nothing
dialog: to understand!
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS her out the door, up the hallway, Montag at
dialog: her heels...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: The kitchen incinerator!
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie, no!
text: -,-and he tries to grab her but she fights him off, slapping
text: wildly, hysteria and terror breaking like a wave...
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: I'M NOT LISTENING TO YOU! I'M NOT!
text: THEY'RE GONNA COME AND BURN US,
scene_heading: GONNA BURN EVERYTHING, BECAUSE OF
dialog: YOU, BECAUSE YOU'VE GONE CRAZY!
text: ---and she keeps going but Montag grabs her around the waist,
text: grappling as she screams, and they trip, fall to the floor...
speaker_heading: TIGHTER ANGLE
text: -,-where the fight goes out of her and she goes limp under
text: his weight, her rage giving way to helpless tears:
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: They're gonna come burn us. I live
dialog: here too. Please.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie, shhh, it's okay.
text: His grip goes gentle, caressing now, stroking her hair. She's
text: weeping, twisting away from his touch, not looking at him.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: They're not gonna burn us, okay? I
dialog: swear. Shhh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: They are. They are. Why are you
dialog: doing this?
scene_heading: TIGHT, TIGHT TWO SHOT
text: as he whispers in her ear, desperate:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie. I sometimes feel like I've
dialog: forgotten something important.
dialog: Something I was supposed to hold
dialog: onto really tight...but I lost it,
dialog: without thinking, like a kid loses
dialog: something, and I forgot I ever even
dialog: had it to start with...
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: That's stupid. You're stupid, you're
text: not making sense.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You remember where we met, Millie?
dialog: How long ago? Do you remember what
dialog: I said? Do you remember what you
dialog: said? What you were wearing? Or
dialog: have the pills taken all that away?
dialog: Can you remember?
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Course I remember. Stupid jerk.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: No. Go away.
text: Montag eases off, seeing the truth. She doesn't remember. He
text: takes the book gently from her hand and sits up, his back
text: against the hallway wall.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Yesterday, I saw a woman burn
dialog: herself, and I thought, my God.
dialog: What's in these books that could
dialog: make a person do that? Is it because
dialog: she's crazy? Or because she isn't?
dialog: I deserve to know that.
dialog: {looks to her)
dialog: I love you, Millie. And I want you
dialog: to help me. If the book says nothing,
dialog: we'll burn it together. Okay?
text: Millie also sits up, her back against the opposite wall. (Two
text: facing profiles.) He opens the book, starts to read:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: "Chapter one. The Sound of the Shell.
dialog: (beat)
text: The boy with the fair hair lowered
text: himself down the last few feet of
text: rock and began to pick his way toward
text: the lagoon. Though he had taken off
text: his school sweater and trailed it
dialog: now from one hand..."
text: CAMERA CLOSES IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on Millie in profile as
text: Montag's voice drones on, her head bowed, tears slipping off
text: her nose. She's trembling, trying to hold very still.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: ",,.when a bird, a vision of red
text: and yellow, flashed upwards with a
dialog: witch-like cry; and this cry was
dialog: echoed by another..."
text: Millie rises abruptly from frame, goes down the hallway past
text: Montag, vanishes into the TV room, slams the door.
text: HOLD ON Montag. Listening. The TV goes on, turned way up loud.
text: Montag sags, the breath draining from his body, the life
text: seeming to go out of him as:
speaker_heading: THE BOOK (SLO-MO)
text: slips from his hand, tumbling toward the floor...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: -..and the book lands before us, normal speed, whacking a
text: table top. ANGLE UP TO:
text: Beatty, seated in a poker game, surrounded by firemen. He
dialog: looks up from the book to:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I found this in the Scooper.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - INCINERATOR - NIGHT
text: PILOT FLAMES BLOOM with a gentle hiss. The door opens,
text: revealing Beatty and Montag, faces awash in the glow. Montag
text: lays "Lord of the Flies" inside, cranks the jets. An ERUPTION
text: OF FLAME leaps up, engulfing the screen...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: EXT - HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
text: ..-and FLAMES engulf the screen, transitioning from fire to
text: fire on the dissolve, roiling in SLO-MO. The fire sweeps aside,
text: revealing Montag and his flame thrower, finger on the trigger,
text: face caked with soot.

speaker_heading: MONTAG

text: doll, a dented metal teapot. He kicks some crap aside, and:
text: Books. Hidden hastily beneath. Just part of the garbage.
text: Montag glances around. Nobody can see him out here in all the
text: confusion and smoke. He grabs the books, stuffs them inside

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - AN OLD MANSION - NIGHT

speaker_heading: TIMECUT:

speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MILLIE (0.S.)
dialog: Something outside. I'm scared.

text: Montag wraps his book in a towel, slips it under the sink. He
text: rises to the door and opens it a crack, revealing:
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: First I thought I was dreaming. It
text: was outside the window, moving around
dialog: in the flower bed. Then I heard it
dialog: scratching at the door. I think it
text: was some kind of animal. Like a dog.
text: Montag joins her in the hallway and holds still, listening.
text: Is that a sound out there? A trash can lid? The wind?
text: He moves through the dark house to the living room, Millie
text: lagging fearfully behind.
text: He goes to the window, eases his fingers through the blinds,
text: opens them a crack. There, outside in the moonlight:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: It's a Hound.
text: Millie's breath catches.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: They're coming for us. They're gonna
dialog: burn us.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
text: No. It's moving off.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We send them out sometimes on slow
dialog: nights. Check out the neighborhoods.
dialog: Let them sniff around. It's random.

text: She turns without a further word, disappears to the bedroom.
text: Montag peers out again, perhaps not so convinced himself...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Montag wakes to darkness, Millie beside him. He lies for a
text: long moment, staring at nothing, wondering what woke him.
text: He becomes aware of a RISING ORANGE GLOW in the room. He sits

speaker_heading: MONTAG

speaker_heading: FIRE CAPTAIN
dialog: (looks over)
dialog: Some neighbors you had. Just never
dialog: know, I guess.
text: He's idly paging a book in his hands. Montag glances down

text: The captain moves off, tosses it onto a roaring pyre of other
dialog: books.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Are they in custody?
speaker_heading: FIREMAN #2
dialog: Drove off five minutes before we

dialog: Had some excitement out your way?
dialog: Just a few doors down, was it?

text: Rang up Jeffers at third district.
dialog: He said you showed up barefoot in
dialog: pajamas. Ready to pitch in and lend
dialog: a hand, were you?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Always, Captain. You know that.
text: Beatty, affable, turns his screen so Montag can see it. The
text: plasma image shows the faces of Clarisse's family. Father.
text: Mother. Cousins. Beatty taps down, idly scanning...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: This file goes back generations. A

dialog: They were even homeschooling the
dialog: daughter, you imagine? Stunning,
dialog: the crap they got away with, wearing

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ever meet them?
text: A loaded question, posed casually. Montag knows it, too. He

speaker_heading: MONTAG
text: Waved to the man over the fence

text: Clarisse's face appears on screen.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: ---that's the one. Said hello to me

text: A new face comes up. The name: "David Faber." Uncle.
text: The photo's a mugshot. The man's got quite a rapsheet. Montag
text: ‘scans down the list of arrests, words flashing onscreen:
text: Antisocial. Unpatriotic. Agitator. Anarchist. Political

scene_heading: EXT - CITY PARK - DAY
text: Faber's alone at a chess table, the top faded and old, playing

text: He becomes aware of Montag some distance away. Faber gives
text: him a glance or two, tries to ignore him.
text: Montag comes this way. Faber tosses the last of the crumbs,
text: sweeps his chess pieces into a bag, gets up to leave.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Mr. Faber? Wait.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: (quickens his pace)

speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You're Clarisse's uncle.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: I'm her father's uncle. What's it
dialog: to you? What do you know about
dialog: Clarisse?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: We were friends. She talked about
dialog: ~ you.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Oh, please...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: She told me you got arrested once
dialog: for being a pedestrian.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Proves nothing. Says so in my file.
speaker_heading: MONTAG

dialog: to put out fires a long time ago.
speaker_heading: FABER

speaker_heading: MONTAG

speaker_heading: FABER (CONT'D)

text: He passes loud music, loud Tvs, loud arguments spilling from

speaker_heading: WHORE
dialog: Hey, baby, looking for company?
dialog: (calls after him)
dialog: I love firemen! Do you right!

scene_heading: INT - FABER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Faber's in his strappy t-shirt, riding a stationary bicycle.
text: It's not a workout -- the bike's connected by electrical leads
text: to a series of old car batteries that Faber is charging.
text: A KNOCK at the door. Faber gets off the bike, breathing hard,
text: toweling sweat from his face.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: MONTAG (0.S.)
dialog: We met in the park.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Veys mir. Look, I told you, unless

speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Faber sighs, opens the door, peers out.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Show me.
text: Montag raises his gym bag into view.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Looks heavy. For a warrant.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: dust give me a few minutes, okay?
dialog: Please. This visit's unofficial.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Do I have a choice, I asked? I'm
dialog: guessing not, I answered. Okay, Mr.
dialog: Pest. You intrigue me.
dialog: (swings the door open)
dialog: Enter freely and of your own will.
text: Montag enters. Faber crosses to the sink:
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Pardon my sweat. Close to dinner
dialog: time. I was charging the batteries
dialog: for the stove.
dialog: (grabs a glass)
dialog: ww I offer you something? An aperitif?
dialog: A glass of slime from the tap?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: No thanks.
text: Faber pours himself some water.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Well then. Formalities are done.
dialog: Who are you, what do you want?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I'm Montag. Your nephew's family
dialog: lived on my street.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Oh, you're that fireman, the one
dialog: down the street. Ah. You turned in
dialog: the alarm, of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: No. I told you, Clarisse was my
dialog: friend.
text: Faber goes to the table, sits.
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Montag moves
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: And so you'd like to know where
text: they are, check up on her, see she's
dialog: safe. And I'm supposed to fall for
dialog: that. I have to say, you guys used
dialog: to be more clever than this.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I don't want to know where they
dialog: are. I just...if you ever get the
dialog: chance, please let her know how
dialog: sorry I am and that it wasn't me.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: That's all?
dialog: (Montag nods)
dialog: I won't get the chance. But your
dialog: sentiment is duly noted. We done?
text: to the table, lays his gym bag before Faber.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: A loaf of bread? A jug of wine?
dialog: Dirty gym clothes? I give up.
text: Montag unzips the bag, pulls out something thick and heavy.
text: Paber's eyes
text: widen as he realizes what it is -- the ancient,
text: ornate Bible Montag dug out of the ground. For a long moment
text: the man forgets to breathe, deeply stunned.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: And this is?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: For you.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: For me. I see.
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: The Revised Testament, government
dialog: approved version, is one of the few
dialog: books not on the burning list. This,
dialog: however, appears to be New Testament,
dialog: done by hand prior to the invention of
dialog: the printing press. It's very old and
dialog: beyond rare, which means the Pope himself
dialog: would gladly light the match. I'm sorry,
dialog: but I can't accept your gift, seeing as
dialog: how very illegal it is.
dialog: 
text: Montag starts pulling more books from his bag, stacking them
text: on the table.
text: Faber's eyes start to glaze.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: What the hell is this?
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I can't keep any of it. I was hoping
dialog: you could find a home for them.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Too bad one of them isn't a
dialog: dictionary, we could look up the
dialog: word "entrapment." Along with the
dialog: word "sucker."
dialog: {off Montag's look)
dialog: How stupid do I look? You're trying
dialog: to get me burned out! Not to mention
dialog: sent back for re-education, only
dialog: this time for life! Having been
dialog: there, I'm compelled to say no. But
dialog: don't think I didn't appreciate the
dialog: attempt. It was very amusing.
dialog: (rises, shooing him)
dialog: Gather your things and go. Out,
dialog: out, out. Thanks for the laugh.
text: Montag stands up, thinks a moment. He then stuns Faber by
text: opening the Bible and ripping out the first page.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Montag pulls a lighter from his pocket, clicks it. A tiny jet
text: of BLUE FLAME leaps up. He holds up the page and ignites it.
text: The page curls and burns before Faber's eyes. He watches the
text: ashes swirl toward the ceiling as:
text: Montag rips the second page out, holds it up. Faber's aghast:
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: What --are--you--doing? Are you
dialog: crazy?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (mutters)
dialog: You and my wife.
text: Montag applies the flame. The second page burns. More ashes
text: swirl. He reaches for the third page...
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: No, no, wait--
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I told you I can't keep it. That
dialog: leaves us two choices--
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: --us, us? How'd this turn into us--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: . MONTAG
dialog: --you take the books, or I do my
dialog: job. This is what I do. Watch.
text: And he rips the third page out, raises it, brings the lighter
text: close. The page starts to blacken and burn.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Up it goes.
text: Faber stifles a scream. He lunges and grabs the page, slapping
text: it to the table, smothering it.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Goddamn it, stop! Just stop it!
text: He snatches up the Bible and backs away, clutching it to his
dialog: chest.
dialog: Pause. Faber
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Idiot! Sadist! This could be the
dialog: last Christian Bible in this
dialog: hemisphere!
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Are you Christian?
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: I'ma Jew!
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Then what do you care?
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: I care, I care! It's us, it's who
dialog: we are, it's who we were!
dialog: (off Montag's look)
dialog: That's why this world sucks, kiddo!
dialog: We don't know who to be. anymore,
dialog: because we don't know where we came
dialog: from or how we got here, or the
dialog: mistakes we made along the way! It's
dialog: all been erased and we've forgotten
dialog: how to even ask the damn questions!
dialog: All we know is what they tell us,
dialog: that parade of shitwits on TV, that's
dialog: become our excuse for truth!
dialog: 
text: looks down at the Bible in his hands. Softly:
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Look at these pages. How many

dialog: in seconds?

speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: God. I can smell the centuries.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Go ahead. Call in your alarm. I'm
dialog: not giving this back.
text: Montag meets Faber's defiant gaze. He's seen that look once
text: before, in the eyes of an old woman holding a kitchen match.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I have more books at home. A few
dialog: dozen in my attic. I'll bring them

dialog: They're us.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: My wife says books aren't real.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: She's right, thank God! You can

speaker_heading: FABER .
dialog: You can laugh, kiddo, but there's

dialog: who burned the great Mayan library
dialog: so the natives would only have Jesus
dialog: to think about, to the invading

speaker_heading: FABER

dialog: in mass graves. Kick your ass.
text: Faber draws closer, hands the book to Montag.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: It's not even about books. It's about
dialog: control. The people who run things
dialog: keeping themselves in power by making
dialog: sure nobody knows enough to ask
dialog: uncomfortable questions. Keep the TVs
dialog: going and the trivia flowing! Who's
dialog: dating who, who's wearing what, will

speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: You kidding me? I'm terrified.

speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (rises)
dialog: I thought we could help each other.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Don't bullshit yourself, kiddo. It's
dialog: unseemly. You're a book-burner who
dialog: woke up one day and realized you
dialog: aren't quite the mindless robot they

dialog: absolution. Try the Catholics.
dialog: (heads for the coops)
dialog: Anyway, you're a little late. Where
dialog: were you twenty, thirty years ago?
dialog: Back when I had piss and vinegar to
dialog: spare?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Maybe you still do.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: That was then. I've since had my

speaker_heading: FABER

speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: See the news this morning? We started
text: using nukes. Pakistan's glowing.
dialog: Genie's out of the bottle again, kiddo.
dialog: Think we'll survive the summer? Me, I

scene_heading: INT - BASEMENT OF TENEMENT - NIGHT
text: Dank and musty, lit by a single bare bulb. Faber's puttering
text: in semi-darkness, going through various drawers and toolboxes,
text: fingers rooting piles of screws, nails, parts.
text: He finds what he's looking for, holds it to the light, blows
text: dust off -- it's a "seashell," a tiny earplug/transmitter.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: You think I'm old. Hope this thing
dialog: still works.
dialog: (hands it to Montag)
dialog: Stick it in your ear.
text: Montag slips it into his left ear, finds a comfortable fit.
text: Faber pulls out a transmitter the size of a pack of cigarettes
text: and a corresponding headset. He clips the transmitter to his
text: belt, plugs in the headset, puts it on. Softly:
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Hear me?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Yeah. In my head.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: And I can hear you. They built 'em
dialog: good back then. Now listen, no more
dialog: showing up at my door. From now on
dialog: we're never seen together and we
dialog: never talk on the phone. We stay in
dialog: touch only with this...
dialog: (taps his headset)

speaker_heading: MONTAG

scene_heading: INT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: STEADICAM brings Montag into the firehouse, past men polishing
text: the truck, past others performing maintenance duties, past
text: the brass poles, past the Hound.
text: It all looks surreal to him. He's seeing it with different
text: eyes now. He steps to the timeclock, hand on the scanner
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
text: Montag. Clocking in.
text: ...and as he turns, ANGLE SHIFTS TO REVEAL:
text: Beatty standing there. Blocking his way. Smiling.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: You're late.
text: Before Montag can utter a word: WHONK!WHONK!WHONK! The fire
text: alarm. Deafening.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Well, nevermind, just in time! Thank
dialog: goodness, it's just not a fire
dialog: without you!
dialog: (turns, yelling)
dialog: GO, GO, GO!
speaker_heading: VARIOUS ANGLES
text: Firemen running, boots all a-scuffle, grabbing HELMETS off

scene_heading: EXT - FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: ...and emerging into the night, firetruck and control van,
text: HORNS BLARING AND LIGHTS FLASHING.
scene_heading: ON THE MOVING SALAMANDER
text: A dizzy blur of motion and lights. Beatty looks back, checking
text: the faces of his men.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Montag, where's that grin?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
text: The fierce grin of all men singed
dialog: and driven back by flame! Isn't
dialog: this what we love? Isn't this what
dialog: we do best?
scene_heading: EXT - SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT
text: A HOVERCOPTER is circling as the Salamander comes rumbling up
text: the street. The firetruck stops.
text: CAMERA CLOSES IN as the firemen unbuckle, some of them jumping
text: down, others pausing uncertainly...
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: CARILLO
dialog: Sir? Is this our jurisdiction?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: No worries. I've cleared it through
dialog: channels.
text: ...and Beatty glances back as CAMERA CONTINUES PAST HIM,
text: closing on Montag. He's at a loss, trying to comprehend:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: We...we've stopped in front of my
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Montag's house sits on its quiet street. The firemen start to
text: assemble a bit awkwardly, not sure what's going on, but:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: At ease. We're dispensing with
dialog: protocol. Tonight is a special
dialog: occasion. Tonight we do things just
dialog: a little differently.
dialog: (glances up to Montag)
dialog: Isn't that right?
text: Feeling like a man in a dream, Montag steps down and walks
text: forward to face Beatty.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: (announcing to all)
dialog: No pumpers! No kerosene! No pretty
dialog: beacon on the lawn! Tonight we get
dialog: a special treat! A display of
dialog: dedication and skill nonpareil! One
dialog: man! One flamethrower!
dialog: (locks eyes with Montag)
dialog: Mr. Ormsby! Mr. Landers! Bring one
dialog: down, if you please!
text: Ormsby and Landers heft a flamethrower off its mount and bring
text: it down from the truck, hustling it over as:
text: The front door of the house bursts open and Millie hurries
text: down the walk, dressed for travel and dragging a suitcase.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: She turned in the alarm?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Don't blame her, Montag, not for
dialog: your stupidity.
text: Montag, stunned, meets her as she reaches the curb. She's all
text: exried out, looking back at the house:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Everything gone now, everything.
dialog: Poor house. Poor family. All gone.
text: Montag steps close, desperate, hoping for some glimmer of
dialog: tenderness or redemption.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Millie. I love you.
text: She looks him in the eye and:
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I hope you die.
text: She brushes past him as Beatty remands her to the TWO COPS on
dialog: the scene:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Officers. A domestic dispute. Would
dialog: you please see after Mrs. Montag?
dialog: Take her where she wants to go?
text: As Millie is helped away, Beatty snaps his fingers at Ormsby
text: and Landers. They sling the flamethrower onto Montag's back,
text: tightening straps and snapping buckles as:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Don't look so shocked. You didn't
dialog: leave her much choice, did you?
dialog: Poor thing was terrified. It was
dialog: the third alarm she called in. I
dialog: ignored the first two, told her to
dialog: be patient. Said you'd come around.
dialog: What a sad disappointment you are.
dialog: How are those straps, secure? Let's
dialog: get that pilot lit.
text: Montag activates the gas feed. Beatty himself applies the
text: igniter. A gentle flame blooms.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Now. Let's finish what you started.
text: They march toward the house, Beatty and Montag, as the others
text: watch. Beatty turns back, calling to them... .
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Break out some windows! Let's get
dialog: some cross ventilation!
text: --and in that moment, Montag sneaks the "seashell" from his
text: pocket and slips it in his ear.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT - FABER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Faber reacts as his transmitter activates with a small red
text: light and a BRIEF TONE. He grabs the unit, slips on the headset
text: with a smile.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: What's on your mind, kiddo?
scene_heading: INT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Montag, of course, can't reply. He enters the house with
text: Beatty, gazing around to find that Millie's taken the books
text: from the attic and strewn them all over the floor.
speaker_heading: FABER'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Hello? Hello?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I can't believe this is happening

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Funny how that works. Everybody
dialog: thinks, everybody is absolutely
dialog: certain, that nothing will ever
dialog: happen to them. Others die, I go
dialog: on. Others get caught, not me.
dialog: Consequences? Never. Except sometimes
dialog: there are. And by the time they

scene_heading: INT - FABER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: TIGHT ON Faber, heart sinking as he listens.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Montag. I'm listening. I don't know

text: Montag hits the trigger and FIRES A BLAST OF FLAME into the
text: living room, igniting the furniture. WHOOOOOOSH!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
speaker_heading: AGAIN!
text: WHOOOOOOSH! The living room walls now catch, sending up sheets
text: of fire. Books on the floor ignite.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: That's the ticket, well done! You
dialog: can't tell me that didn't feel good!
dialog: All your sins washed away with good
dialog: cleansing fire! Onward, Montag!
dialog: Lead the way!
dialog: 
text: Montag leads Beatty down the hallway into:
speaker_heading: THE TV ROOM
text: It's on, of course. "The Family" is playing.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Something here you'd like to burn?
dialog: The sorrow of past regrets? The
dialog: stench of failure? That blow-dried
dialog: imbecile and his chattering hag?
text: Montag pulls the trigger. The FIRE BURSTS FORTH, hitting the
text: screens and imploding them. The vacuum sucks fire in and
text: belches it out again, plastic igniting as the babble of the
text: Family gives way to the HIDEOUS SHRIEK OF MELTING SPEAKERS.
text: THE BEDROOM: Montag stares at the bed he shared for years
text: with his wife. WHOOOQOOSH! Up it goes, a funeral pyre...
text: THE KITCHEN: WHOOOOOSH! Table, countertop, appliances -- gone...
text: THE HALLWAY: A flaming corridor. Beatty and Montag retreat to
text: the front door, Montag laying down BLASTS OF FLAME...
scene_heading: EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: -..and they emerge coughing, dark with soot, as the house
text: behind them burns. They turn to watch.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY

scene_heading: IN THE CONTROL VAN

speaker_heading: CONTROLLER #1
dialog: I've got a signal. Some kind of

speaker_heading: CONTROLLER #2
dialog: Source?

speaker_heading: CONTROLLER #1
dialog: Son of a bitch is transmitting.
scene_heading: MONTAG AND BEATTY
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: How long have you known?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: From the start. Montag, you idiot.
dialog: Our Hound smelled the books on you.
text: He raises his plasma screen clipboard, punches in a playback
text: command, turns it so Montag can see. On it, a recording:
text: THE HOUND'S POV: We've seen this moment before -- Montag comes
dialog: around the firetruck the night he took the first two books,
text: freezing in his tracks as he encounters the beast.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: {enters new command)
dialog: So I checked the surveillance cams.
dialog: Lo and behold.
text: A new image pops up. From a hidden ceiling cam, we see Montag
text: pulling the first book out of the Scooper blade. Beatty freezes
text: the image, tracking it in for a TIGHT CLOSEUP.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: "Charlie the Choo Choo?" You threw
dialog: it all away -- your career, your
dialog: marriage, your life -- for goddamn
dialog: "Charlie the Choo Choo?"
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
text: Controller #2 hurries up from the control van, pulls Beatty
text: aside, whispers in his ear. Beatty gives him a look.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Really?
text: The man nods. Beatty sends him off, turns back to Montag.
text: There's a new look in Beatty's eye -- hungry, vengeful.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: I gave you every chance. Tried to
dialog: woo you, reason with you. I even
dialog: sent the Hound to sniff around your
dialog: house at night and throw a scare
dialog: into you. Even that didn't work...
dialog: (cocks his head)
dialog: -.-though it did get your neighbors
dialog: burned out and on the run. Yes, your
dialog: fault. All your fault.
dialog: (closing on him)
dialog: You dense...arrogant...traitorous...
dialog: ungrateful little bastard.
text: Beatty stuns Montag by hauling off and slapping him hard across
text: the ear (the one with the seashell in it). WHAP!
scene_heading: INT - FABER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: -- and the sound makes Faber jump, wrenching off his headset
dialog: as if he'd been slapped himself --
scene_heading: EXT - MONTAG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: After all I did for you. After the
dialog: kindness I showed.
text: WHAP! Another slap across the same ear. Montag clutches the
text: side of his head in agony --
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: I vouched for you. Put my professional
dialog: standing on the line for you. This
dialog: is how you repay me? And betray me?
text: WHAP! Beatty slaps him a third time -- only this time uses
text: his other hand. The blow rocks Montag's head, and:
text: The seashell flies from his ear, skittering onto the pavement .
scene_heading: IN THE CONTROL VAN
text: Controller #1 enters a command:
speaker_heading: CONTROLLER #1
text: Jamming transmission now.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: BEATTY
text: strolls to the seashell, scoops it off the pavement.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Your pal Faber?
dialog: (off Montag's shock)
dialog: Of course I know! I've been tracking
dialog: your every step! There are cameras
dialog: on every street corner of this city,
dialog: you moron! And Faber's been under
dialog: surveillance from the moment his
dialog: nephew went on the run!
dialog: (raises his clipboard)
dialog: We have you talking to him in the
dialog: park! Entering his building! Chatting
dialog: on the roof! Want to see? Or are
dialog: you willing to take my word for it?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Faber! Run!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Go ahead, yell. He can't hear you.
dialog: We've jammed the transmission.
dialog: (closing in)
dialog: The next thing Mr. Faber knows, the
text: police will be kicking his door in.
dialog: WS Want to go over there, just to see
dialog: the look on his face? Oh, dear, I
dialog: almost forgot. You'll be in custody
dialog: yourself. For treason and sedition.
dialog: (stops before him)
dialog: If you're through making a fool of
dialog: yourself, you're under arrest.
text: Beat. Montag stands pinned in Beatty's gaze. And then:
text: CLICK. He works the safety catch on the flamethrower. The
text: flame billows up with a gentle hiss.
text: Beatty goes stiff, eyes widening slightly. And he smiles.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Well, that's one way to get an
text: audience. Hold a gun on a man and
dialog: make him listen to your speech.
dialog: Well, speech away. What'll it be
dialog: this time? Why don't you belch
dialog: Shakespeare at me? "There is no
dialog: terror, Cassius, in your threats,
dialog: for I am armed so strong in honesty
dialog: that they pass me as an idle wind,
dialog: which I respect not!" How's that?

speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: We never burned right.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BEATTY
dialog: Hand it over, Montag. You're done.
dialog: Beat .
text: WHOOOOOOOOSH! An ERUPTION OF FIRE leaps out and hits Beatty
text: square in the chest, a searing fist of flame that grips him,
text: envelops him, drives him back, blows him off his feet.
text: Beatty sails through the air on a booster of fire, a blazing,
text: shrieking scarecrow. He lands on his back in a flaming heap,
text: arms flailing and legs drumming...and then goes still.
text: A hush falls. For an extended moment the scene is a tableau,
text: everybody frozen, faces slack with unspeakable shock.

speaker_heading: MONTAG
text: stands with the murder weapon in his hands, just as stunned

text: acted on their own volition, as if they weren't even his.
text: He looks up. Firemen are backing away, a few turn and run.
text: Montag knows there's no going back. Ever. He embraces his
text: moment of insanity, sets his feet --
speaker_heading: MONTAG
speaker_heading: RUUUUUN!
text: -- and begins to burn. WHOOOOOSH! Firemen scatter, running
text: clear as an ARC OF FLAME sweeps up and down the Salamander,
text: engulfing the firetruck, turning it into a blazing pyre.
text: Montag turns, swiveling the nozzle toward the control van...
text: ++-and WHOOOOOOSH! FLAMES envelop the forward half of the
text: van. The controllers scatter from their posts and evacuate
text: out the back doors, running into the night as:
text: Montag circles around, BLASTING FIRE into the now empty van.
text: Monitor screens EXPLODE, spewing glass.
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
text: He turns again, SCREAMING now, primal, stripped bare, hosing
text: the firetruck again, burning everything, burning all.
text: The flamethrowers lining the truck start EXPLODING on their
text: mounts, one after another, sending FIREBALLS into the sky.
text: The hovercopter veers off, fleeing the explosions.
text: BOOOOM! The fuel tank blows, lifting the Salamander into the
text: air and slamming it awesomely back down again, now a tangle
text: of shattered, flaming wreckage.
text: And then all is still. Montag stands, alone now, the street
text: around him in flames.
text: In a daze, he walks over to his murdered captain. The body's
text: still burning. Montag scans the pavement, finds:
text: The seashell. It's a bit scorched, but seems intact. He picks
text: it up, holds it to his ear with a shaky hand. He hears STATIC,
dialog: intermittent sound -- a voice?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Faber? Faber? Can you hear me?
text: The Mechanical Hound lunges from the flaming wreckage of the
text: firetruck, trailing fire as it streaks across the pavement.
text: WHAM! The beast hits Montag like a train, taking him off his
text: feet. He hits the pavement hard, the seashell goes flying.
text: The Hound starts savaging him, Montag bashing it with the
text: flamethrower nozzle, trying to drive it off.
text: The beast clamps down on his thigh and the hypo tongue shoots
text: out, jabbing hard into Montag's flesh. Montag SCREAMS as the
text: plunger depresses and the amber fluid starts to flow. But
text: only half the dose is emptied, because Montag rams the
text: flamethrower nozzle into the Hound's mouth and:
dialog: 
text: WHOOOOM! A BLAST OF FLAME erupts, driving the beast back,
text: blowing it off its feet. Flaming fluid spatters everywhere.
text: Montag's on fire, rolling across the pavement, trying to
text: smother the flames. He yanks the small extinguisher off his
text: arm and hoses himself with retardant, putting himself out.
dialog: 
text: He sits up, sees the flaming Hound coming for him again. He
text: lets the thing have it in the face with ANOTHER BLAST OF FIRE,
dialog: driving it back --
speaker_heading: HOUND'S POV
text: -- and the flames damage the Hound's optics, its image of the
text: world jittering to snow as FLASHING WORDS appear: "Warning.
dialog: Optic Damage. Warning. Optic damage."
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
text: watches the Hound spinning in circles, burning and blinded,
text: enraged, lashing out in all directions.
text: Montag rolls over, tries to get to his feet. He collapses,
text: SCREAMING, his leg useless from the dose of procaine.
text: He throws the quick-release buckles and shrugs the flamethrower
text: off. Trying again, he manages to get halfway to his feet,
text: hobbling across the pavement to the seashell. He scoops it
text: up, jams it in his ear, fleeing the scene.

text: flashes and stutters...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - POLICE COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
text: ..-While a BEEPING SIGNAL FLASHES on a screen over a SATELLITE

speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: Been tracking this for a few minutes

dialog: It's Beatty's Hound.
speaker_heading: POLICE CAPTAIN
dialog: Pinpoint it before you lose it. And

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT - ROUND BUILDING - SEVENTH FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
text: Faber helps Montag along the curved landing past long rows of
text: tall sheet-covered shelves, the smoke from the cookfires
text: drifting up from below. Montag's leaning on Faber, limping.
text: Faber pulls him into a dark cubby hole between shelves. The
text: area contains a cot, a few chairs, a sleeping bag, some tin
text: pots and pans are on a crate. Montag sits heavily on the floor.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: You gonna make it?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
text: My head feels clearer. Leg hurts
dialog: like hell.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: But can you travel?
dialog: (off Montag's look)
dialog: I caught your act on the news. Me
dialog: and a few billion other people.
dialog: You're more wanted than Dillinger.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
text: Faber starts pulling clothes from an old foot locker, rooting
text: through them, tossing some to Montag.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Lose the uniform. These are old and
dialog: disgusting, but you'll be less
dialog: conspicuous.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (sniffs the clothes)
dialog: Where we going?
speaker_heading: FABER
text: Far away as possible.
dialog: (off Montag's look)
dialog: There are some people, south of the
dialog: city, up in the mountains...
text: Montag painfully starts peeling his uniform off.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: What kind of people?
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: People. The kind that ran out of
dialog: luck. Like us.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: They live in the mountains?
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Better than prison or re-education
dialog: camps. You'll like these folks,
dialog: they've got books. Lots of books.
dialog: (tosses more clothes)
dialog: In case we get separated, follow
dialog: the river out of the city. Always
dialog: stick to the river. Got that? C'mon,

scene_heading: EXT - ROUND BUILDING - NIGHT
text: AERIAL VIEW of the building, a beautiful establishing shot.
text: As OUR ANGLE SLOWLY DESCENDS...
text: ---a PLITTER enters frame, dropping almost quietly from the
text: sky. Followed by another. And another. A string of flitters
text: descending toward the roof like drifting seed pods.
text: A flitter is a one-man flying exoskeleton with four ducted
text: turbofans, two above and two below -- picture a flying suit
text: open at the front that you step into. Each one is piloted by
text: a_ SWAT TROOPER, armored and helmeted, face invisible behind a
text: gleaming black visor. (Each flitter also has a pair of
text: automated GATLING GUNS mounted on the sides.)
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
text: The flitters touch down one after another, gentle as kisses,
text: instantly taking off again as each trooper jumps clear.
text: The flitters now become pilotless drones that begin circling
text: the building, onboard systems going fully automatic, computers
text: and gyros humming. IMAGING SCANNERS activate, methodically
dialog: sweeping the building...
speaker_heading: ON THE ROOF
text: +..as the troopers scurry across the roof, weapons at the
text: ready, moving with scary precision and hand signals. They
text: assemble, crouching in a circle formation, waiting...
text: ON THE GROUND
text: -.-aS8 SWAT APC VEHICLES encircle the building on the ground,
text: also sweeping with imaging scanners. TROOPS come pouring out
text: of the vehicles, down alleys, taking up positions...
scene_heading: INT - POLICE COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
text: ..as the SCANNER IMAGES come through on the monitors:
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: (on headset)
dialog: We have movement throughout the

text: scattered throughout all levels. At
dialog: least four dozen unfriendlies by my
dialog: count. Check your handhelds...
scene_heading: EXT - BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: The troopers on the roof check their plasma palm-screens as a

text: the people inside.
scene_heading: EXT - BUILDING - HIGH ABOVE AN ALLEY - NIGHT
text: A flitter is drifting sideways, tracking movement inside. As

text: FIGURES IN HEAT REGISTER SHAPES moving along together...
scene_heading: INT - SEVENTH FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
text: ..-which are Montag and Faber hurrying down the long row of
text: sheet-covered shelves. Montag's new clothes are pretty shabby,
text: but at least the coat is warm.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: What was this place?
speaker_heading: . FABER
dialog: Believe it or not, it was a book
dialog: depository once. In fact...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
text: He indicates the covered shelves. With a look of disbelief,
text: Montag reaches up grabs a sheet, pulls it off. A whole row of
text: eight-foot high shelves are revealed, lined with books.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: PABER
dialog: Been trickling in here for decades.
dialog: Probably the biggest stash in North
dialog: America.
text: Montag continues down the line, stunned, pulling off more
text: sheets, revealing more books. He looks around, sees the various
text: levels lined with covered shelves. Books beyond counting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Some people and I were trying to
dialog: work out a plan once to get 'em out
dialog: of the city. Never could figure out
dialog: how to move so many books, though,
dialog: not with all the surveillance. Then
dialog: I got arrested, and nothing ever
dialog: came of it. That was years ago. And
dialog: here they sit.
text: Faber glances over, sees a book, pulls it off the shelf -- a
dialog: paperback of "David Copperfield."
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Oh, nice. Take this one. For the
dialog: trip. One of my favorites.
text: Montag slips the book into his pocket with a smile, pulls
text: down the next sheet, revealing:
text: The flitter is outside one of the huge windows just on the
text: other side of the shelves, hovering there, peering in. Montag's
text: stunned, frozen. Faber can't see from his angle:
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: What?
text: The gatling guns abruptly swivel up and lock into place.
text: Montag lunges, slamming into Faber as:
text: BRRRAAAAAAAAPPP! The window and the surrounding walls EXPLODE
text: inward in a hurricane of masonry and glass. Montag and Faber
text: hit the floor, the bookshelves above their heads vaporizing
text: in a cloud of paper and wood...
speaker_heading: ON THE ROOF
text: ---while the troopers, still in their circle formation, FIRE
text: BOLTS straight down into the tarpaper at their feet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
text: They turn, running out to form a wider circle where they FIRE
text: different bolts into the roof -- unlike the first, these are
text: rappelling bolts. They quick-snap steel cables leading from
text: their chest harnesses, getting ready...
text: IN THE BUILDING
text: ...as silence falls. Montag and Faber look up from the floor,
text: ears ringing, stunned. Montag crawls a few feet, peers around
text: what's left of the book shelf.
text: A huge section of exterior wall is gone. The flitter's out
text: there, scanning and hovering. Locking in.
text: Montag grabs Faber, pulls him to his feet, runs.
text: BRRRRAAAAAAAAAAPPP! BRRRRAAAAAAAAPPP! The flitter tracks them
text: sideways, the wall disintegrating to dust in the onslaught.
text: Montag and Faber run along the landing, books and shelving
text: exploding and vaporizing down the line behind them, churned
text: into clouds of confetti, erupting out over the railing, snowing
dialog: down to the floors below --
speaker_heading: GROUND FLOOR
text: ~- where doors EXPLODE off their hinges, people SCREAMING and
text: scattering as troopers swarm in, laser-sighted assault rifles
text: sweeping to and fro in the darkness. BURSTS OF GUNFIRE erupt --
speaker_heading: SEVENTH FLOOR
text: -- as Montag and Faber dive to the floor. The flitter's gatling
text: guns sweep over their heads and past them, ripping on down
text: the row of bookshelves...
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: ...and the flitter pauses, ceasing fire, coming back again to
dialog: scan for its target...
speaker_heading: INSIDE
text: ...as Montag and Faber hug the floor, thinking the flitter's
text: gone, deafened by the GUNFIRE ECHOING through the building
text: from below. A frozen moment as their eyes meet:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: FABER
dialog: Don't. I haven't felt this good in
dialog: years.
dialog: (a harsh laugh)
dialog: I'm scared shitless.

speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Come on! Let's find a way out!
text: They lunge to their feet, start to run, but:
speaker_heading: SLOW MOTION
text: BRRRRAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPP! The flitter's gunfire chews through
text: the bookshelves again, churning up a tornado of debris...
text: ..-as Montag spins, grabbing Faber's hand...
text: ..-and the gunfire hits Faber, blowing him off his feet,
text: knocking him sideways in a hazy red mist, ripping him out of
text: Montag's grasp, propelling him through the railing...
text: ...as Montag spins, jerked off balance, also crashing through
dialog: the railing...
text: ...and Faber sails out over the seven story drop inside the
text: building, floating now in a halo of debris...
text: ..-.and Montag plummets, grabbing the collapsing railing as he

text: ...and Faber falls away from us, drifting away like a dream,
text: down and down through the concentric circles of the landings
text: toward the ground floor far below...
speaker_heading: RESUME SPEED
text: as Montag jerks to a stop, holding on to the shattered railing
text: above his head for dear life, legs kicking wildly above the
text: same sickening drop that Faber just took.
text: The railing is disintegrating in his grasp, lurching, tearing
text: loose. He looks down, sees the sixth floor landing below his
text: feet. He tries to swing himself in, kicking as his toes barely
text: scrape the edge of the railing below...
text: ..-and the railing he's holding rips loose. Montag plummets --
text: but hooks the sixth floor railing with his arms as he
text: falls, slamming to a hard stop, SCREAMING as a few ribs break.
text: He holds on, dazed with shock and pain, trying to find the
dialog: strength to pull himself up and over, while:
speaker_heading: ON THE ROOF
text: The troopers tuck their heads and detonate the inner circle
text: of bolts -- a RING OF SMALL EXPLOSIONS kicks up...
text: IN THE BUILDING
text: .--tearing loose a 20-foot diameter circle of the roof which
text: drops awesomely into the building, plummeting past Montag...

dialog: 
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: ON THE ROOF
text: ...and the troopers rush from their positions, jumping through
dialog: " the smoking hole...
text: IN THE BUILDING
text: +,-,and dropping down in a controlled freefall on their harness
text: rigs, laser sights sweeping the air.
text: Homeless people break cover on various landings, running for
text: their lives. The troopers OPEN FIRE as they plummet on their
text: cables, nailing evacuees on the run, shooting at anything
dialog: that moves.
text: Montag hauls himself up and over the railing onto the sixth
text: floor landing. He staggers to his feet and darts off behind
text: the bookshelves into the shadows as the troopers drop into
text: frame from above, their GUNFIRE chewing the area...
speaker_heading: HANDHELD
text: Montag runs, a breathless plunge through madness, turning
text: this way and that, hearing yells and screams, barely avoiding
text: the troopers pounding up the stairs and sweeping the building,
text: FLASHES OF GUNFIRE stuttering and lighting up the shadows.
text: He comes to a window. His only way out. He grabs an old metal
text: chair, swings it, bashes out the window. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM
text: out onto a fire escape six floors above the ground...
text: -.-and his nemesis the flitter descends into frame before
text: him, gatling guns swiveling up and locking into place.
text: Montag freezes, nowhere to go, knowing he's dead, and:
text: WHIIITITIRRRRR! The gatling guns spin, out of ammo.
text: Montag's stunned. Hearing VOICES behind him. A heartbeat of
dialog: decision, and:
text: He jumps from the landing, slams into the flitter, arms wrapped
text: around one of the lower turbofan ducts, hanging on for dear
text: life as the flitter bobs and spins, off balance, gyros
text: struggling as it goes twisting out of control, sailing across
text: the street toward the face of the building next door...
scene_heading: INT - BUILDING NEXT DOOR - NIGHT

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
text: Montag rises, dazed and bleeding, looks out the demolished

text: He turns away, horrified. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he limps through
text: the shadows, looking for a way out...
scene_heading: EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT
text: ...and bashes through a basement-level window. He crawls out,

scene_heading: EXT - RIVERBANK - PRE-DAWN
text: Montag and his log are swept gently into a tangle of other
text: debris, coming to a stop. He's unconscious and shivering, his
text: hands like white claws holding the log in a death grip.
text: We're looking at a man at the end of his last frayed rope.
dialog: This would be, literally, his last gasp. Except:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 111.
text: FIGURES ENTER FRAME. Rough-hewn. We won't yet see their faces.
text: They gather at water's edge, peering down at Montag. Two of
text: the men wade into the water, pulling the log closer, prying
text: him free, handing him up toward the others.
text: Montag is dragged onto the riverbank, though he's not even
text: aware it's happening. He's out of it, shaking with hypothermia
dialog: and fever...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT - WILDERNESS - DAWN
text: ..-and now he's wrapped in skins, being dragged along on a
text: rough wooden litter, head whipping with feverish dreams...
speaker_heading: FLASHCUT INSERT
text: ..-where a nightmare Hound lunges into camera, a blur of teeth
dialog: and eyes and procaine tongue...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
text: -.-and Montag CRIES OUT, flailing at phantoms as they drag
dialog: him further and further into the mountains...
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT - TENT - LATE DAY
text: Very quiet here. CAMERA PANS a spill of waning sunlight across
text: the floor, coming to:
text: Montag. He's wrapped in bedding up to his chin. A cool damp
text: cloth on his forehead.
text: His eyes flutter open, trying to focus. He's coming back to
text: us. As coherency returns, he looks around...
text: -..and sees a LARGE MAN hunkered across the tent, staring at
text: him with piercing eyes and a wild tangle of beard. His name
text: is GRANGER. He looks like he's been squatting there for hours.
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: So. You live. You've been out all
dialog: day, I was beginning to wonder.
text: Montag tries to speak, but can't manage it just yet. Granger
text: glances to a LITTLE BOY.
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: Go on, get the others.
text: The boy scampers from the tent. Montag becomes aware of a no-
text: nonsense elderly woman, MAGGIE, as she leans over and gives
text: him a sip of water.
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Thank you.
text: PEOPLE start entering, finding places, hunkering down. Montag
text: finds faces staring at him, not all of them friendly -- WILSON,
text: SYKES, MORALES, PEMBERTON, ROYCE. Whispers are exchanged, as:
speaker_heading: MORALES
dialog: Maggie?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Hypothermia almost did him in. And
dialog: being in that filthy river all night
dialog: with all these cuts...I had to pump
text: him full of antibiotics.
speaker_heading: SYKES
dialog: As if we had plenty to spare. We
dialog: should have left him where he was.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Murdered him, you mean?
speaker_heading: SYKES
dialog: Just let the river have him. That
dialog: would have been enough.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Amounts to the same thing.
speaker_heading: GRANGER -
dialog: That's not the way we do things.
dialog: Not who we are. You know that.
speaker_heading: SYKES
dialog: What I don't know is that we can
dialog: trust him.
speaker_heading: PEMBERTON
dialog: That broadcast. The manhunt. Could
text: have been faked. A ploy.
speaker_heading: SYKES
dialog: He could be a plant. They might be
dialog: looking to crack down on us. Of
dialog: course they'd have to find us first.
dialog: What better way?
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: So you do think we should kill him.
text: Granger unsheathes a bowie knife, passes it to Sykes.
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: Go on. You feel most strongly about
dialog: it. He's all yours.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
text: Sykes holds the knife awkwardly, meets Montag's gaze. Montag
text: glances to Granger, notes his twinkle of amusement as:
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: Go on, hell. I'm hungry. Dinner's
dialog: waiting.
speaker_heading: SYKES
dialog: Dammit. You know that's not what I
dialog: mean. We can just leave him behind.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: No, I say do it. Kill him.
text: Montag looks up as another man enters the tent. Recognition
text: dawns in Montag's face as CAMERA COMES AROUND to reveal:
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: Son of a bitch owes me money. I bet
dialog: he didn't bring it.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Dillman? Diliman?
text: Dillman comes over, crouches down. Takes Montag's hand.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You're alive.
speaker_heading: DILLMAN :
dialog: More than I can say for you. Caught -
dialog: your act on the late show. Good
text: reception up here on the handhelds.
dialog: Wow, some climax. Three Hounds and
dialog: everything. Great special effects.
dialog: (leans in)
dialog: You could'a just left town like I
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You could've invited me.
text: They share a smile. Beat. Dillman turns to the others.
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: I know this man. He's a good man.
dialog: Whatever you do to him, you do to
dialog: me. If he's left behind, I'll be
dialog: with him. That's the way it is.
speaker_heading: PEMBERTON
dialog: Your loyalty is admirable. But.
dialog: (glances to Granger)
dialog: Is it enough?
text: The question lingers in the air. And then:
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: He gave me a book once.
text: All eyes go to the tent flap. Clarisse hovers there, peering
text: in, shy but self-determined. Montag is quietly overcome with
text: emotion at the sight of her. She meets his eyes and smiles.
speaker_heading: CLARISSE
dialog: That's Mr. Montag. He used to be a
dialog: fireman.
text: Looks are traded in heavy silence...
scene_heading: EXT - CAMP - MAGIC HOUR
text: -..and Montag is brought from the tent, Clarisse and Dillman
text: at his side. There are tents, pack mules, campfires. PEOPLE
text: are going about their business, a nomadic tribe of sixty or
text: more. Montag draws his share of stares and curious looks.
text: Montag pauses, seeing a man before him. The face is familiar,
text: it him takes a moment to realize -- it's Clarisse's father.
text: They stare at each other for a long moment. Softly:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I met your uncle. He saved my life.
dialog: I liked him very much.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Me too.
text: Beat. Clarisse's father offers his hand. They shake.
scene_heading: EXT - CAMP - MAGIC HOUR
text: Various groups are eating around the campfires. We find Montag
dialog: with Granger and the others:
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: We're breaking camp after dinner.
text: Heading further up into the
dialog: mountains. Always better to travel
dialog: at night. Are you up to it?
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I'll keep up.
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: Winter's coming on. We'll hook up
dialog: with a few other groups like ours.
dialog: We know some abandoned mineshafts,
dialog: some of 'em go pretty deep. They're
dialog: not comfortable, but they keep us
dialog: alive when the snow falls. We'll
text: spend the winter there, hibernating
dialog: like bears.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A few groans.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: And catching up on your reading?
dialog: (off their looks)
dialog: Faber said you had books. A lot of
dialog: books. Is that where they are, up
dialog: in the mines?
speaker_heading: ROYCE
dialog: Did he say mines? Or minds? Oh dear,
text: a pun.
text: Montag looks around at their faces, confused.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I'm...sorry. I don't understand.
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: We have books. Yes, you could say
dialog: that. But not the kind you think.
dialog: We hid them away where nobody could
dialog: ever find them. Or burn them.
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Go on. Introduce yourselves.
text: Morales leans forward, speaking to Montag:
speaker_heading: MORALES
text: There was a desert wind blowing
dialog: that night. It was one of those
dialog: dry, hot Santa Anas that come down
text: through the mountain passes and
dialog: curl your hair and make your nerves
dialog: jump and your skin itch. On nights
dialog: like that every booze party ends in
dialog: a fight. Meek little wives feel the
text: edge of the carving knife and study
dialog: their husbands' necks. Anything can
dialog: happen. You can even get a full
text: glass of beer at a cocktail lounge.
dialog: (extends his hand)
dialog: Raymond Chandler. The Simple Art of
dialog: Murder. Pleased to meet you.
text: Montag shakes his hand, still confused, as another man speaks:
speaker_heading: ROYCE
dialog: No one would have believed, in the
dialog: last years of the nineteenth century,
dialog: that human affairs were being watched
dialog: keenly and closely by intelligences
dialog: greater than man's and yet as mortal
dialog: as his own...
text: And now other voices join in, coming from all around him, the
text: words mingling and overlapping:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEMBERTON
dialog: Listen. Billy Pilgrim has come
text: unstuck in time. Billy has gone to
text: sleep a senile widower and awakened
text: on his wedding day. He has walked
text: through a door in 1955 and come out
dialog: another one in 1941...
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: ...the man in black fled across the
text: desert, and the gunslinger followed.
dialog: The desert was the apotheosis of
dialog: all deserts...
speaker_heading: MATHESON
dialog: ...on those cloudy days, Robert
dialog: Neville was never sure when sunset
dialog: came, and sometimes they were in
dialog: the streets before he could get
dialog: back...
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: ...the seller of lightning rods
text: arrived just ahead of the storm. He
dialog: came along the street of Green Town,
dialog: Illinois, in the late cloudy October
text: day, sneaking glances over his
dialog: shoulder...
speaker_heading: SYKES
dialog: ...there was me, that is Alex, and
dialog: my three droogs, that is Pete,
dialog: Georgie, and Dim, Dim being really
dialog: dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar
dialog: making up our rassoodocks what to
dialog: do with the evening...
dialog: 116.
text: Montag's looking around, nonplussed. He glances to Dillman,
text: who starts laughing at the look on his face.
speaker_heading: . DILLMAN
dialog: Say hello to the books.
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: Don't judge us by our covers.
dialog: (taps his head)
dialog: Each one of us. A book. With the
dialog: pages locked away where they can
dialog: never be burned.
text: (leans over, clasps
dialog: Montag's hand)
dialog: I answer to the name I was given,
dialog: Harold Granger. But I have a secret
dialog: name. Walter Miller, A Canticle for
dialog: Liebowitz, published 1959. We have
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: GRANGER (CONT'D)
dialog: many secret names here. Look around.
dialog: There's H.G. Wells. Mary Shelley.
dialog: Jonathan Swift. Lincoln. Shaw.
dialog: Darwin. Also Matthew, Mark, Luke
dialog: and John.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Tell me, fireman. What's your secret
dialog: name going to be?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
text: He had this on him. Still damp, but
dialog: itll dry...
text: She tosses the paperback of "David Copperfield" to Granger.
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: Ah. David Copperfield. Dickens.
dialog: Good one. But thick. You'll have
dialog: your work cut out for you.
text: Granger tosses the book. Montag catches it. Off his look, we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT
text: The tribe comes slowly up the slope of a mountain pass by the
text: light of a full moon, ragged knots of people and pack animals.
text: Thirty miles behind them is the city, spread out below in an
text: ocean of lights.
speaker_heading: MONTAG (0.S.)
dialog: "Chapter one. I am born. Whether I
dialog: shall turn out to be the hero of my
dialog: own life, or whether that station
dialog: will be held by anybody else, these
dialog: pages must show..."
text: Montag appears, coming toward us, the paperback in his hands.
text: He's got a penlight on it, speaking the words aloud:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: "To begin my life with the beginning
dialog: of my life, I record that I was
dialog: born, as I have been informed and
dialog: believe, on a Friday, at twelve
dialog: o'clock at night. It was remarked
dialog: that the clock began to strike, and
dialog: I began to cry, simultaneously..."
text: His voice trails off. A SOUND has been building, unnoticed at
text: first, but now loud enough to make him stop and look up.
text: People all along the slope are also pausing, also gazing up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 118.
text: A SHRIEKING SOUND is tearing the sky, turning the world hushed
dialog: and eerie.
text: Montag sees glowing VAPOR TRAILS forming in the stratosphere
text: high above, lit by the moon.
text: Streaking overhead. Toward the city.
text: And then, from a great distance, a WAILING SOUND drifts from
text: the city, rising and falling. CIVIL DEFENSE SIRENS.
scene_heading: INT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Millie's in bed, watching TV, half dozing. She rises, hearing
text: the SIRENS. She's drawn toward the window, wondering what on
dialog: earth that sound is...
scene_heading: EXT - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT
text: Montag sees one of the vapor trails break out of formation,
text: separating from the others and descending now in gentle arc
text: toward the city, drifting as silently as thistledown.
text: A PINPOINT OF LIGHT begins to glow brighter and brighter at
text: the head of the falling vapor trail, glimmering and halating,
text: almost like an angel being born.
text: Montag and the others watch in wonder, still not making sense
dialog: of what they're seeing...
scene_heading: INT - HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Millie comes to the window, gazing out at the city. A BRILLIANT
text: GLOW builds from the sky, descending to earth. She looks up,
text: her face becoming childlike, enchanted...
scene_heading: EXT - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT
text: -..and Montag suddenly realizes:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (softly) .
dialog: Oh my God...
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: (also realizing)
text: DON'T LOOK AT THE LIGHT! DON'T LOOK
dialog: AT THE L--
text: Light. Flashing into existence over the city like a silent
text: sun, or the bang at the beginning of creation, stunning and
text: beyond comprehension. The world turns white before us like a
text: million flashbulbs going off at once, turning the people and
text: animals on the mountain slope into silhouettes, mules bucking,
text: men and women falling and throwing themselves to the ground.
dialog: 
dialog: 119.
text: Granger is caught looking at the detonation, screaming and
text: clapping his hand over his eyes...
scene_heading: THE CITY - EXTREME SLOW MOTION
text: ++-as a wave of holy white fire sweeps through the canyons of
text: concrete and steel, shattering buildings like crystal vases,
text: taking bridges off their moorings, turning the river to steam,
text: toppling towers, ripping trains off their tracks, melting
text: glass and beam and rivet to slag...
scene_heading: INT - HOTEL - NIGHT (SLO-MO)
text: ..-and Millie never has time to scream as the glare blows
text: through the window and sends her sailing on a wind of white
text: fire, the walls collapsing and taking flight, a flaming bedside
text: lamp hurtling through frame...
scene_heading: EXT - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT
text: ..-and Montag pulls his face off the ground as the initial
text: glare subsides enough to see, staring in horror, the ROAR of
text: the detonation now rolling across the mountains like a thousand
text: claps of endless thunder...
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: Millie.
scene_heading: THE CITY - EXTREME SLOW MOTION
text: +.-and the fire expands ever onward, pushing before it a tidal
text: wave of perfect pristine technology now reduced to flaming
text: debris in the roaring heart of a nuclear furnace, all the
dialog: great works of humankind now undone...
scene_heading: EXT - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT
text: +.-and Montag gets to his feet, staring in awe.
text: A HUGE MUSHROOM CLOUD is erupting from the glare, rising into
dialog: the sky.
text: People around him are huddled, sobbing, disoriented. A few
text: others also get to their feet, watching.
text: The shockwave of wind arrives, turning the mountain slope
text: into a momentary hurricane, trees whipping in a frenzy,
text: knocking some people back off their feet. Montag covers his
text: face with his hands, protecting his eyes. As the wind begins
text: to dissipate, he hears:
speaker_heading: DILLMAN (0.S.)
dialog: Montag! Montag!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 120.
text: Montag looks down the slope. There, far below, stands Dillman.
text: His arms are spread wide, his face turned toward the mushroom
text: cloud, his teeth bared in a grimace of what may be either
dialog: sheer terror or joyous exultation. Let's face it -- in this
text: moment, Dillman's gone just a little bit insane:
speaker_heading: DILLMAN
dialog: (bellowing)
text: HISTORY BEGINS WITH US!
text: Montag turns, sees people shaking and crying, dazed with shock.
text: Pemberton's running by, wild-eyed and incoherent. Montag grabs
text: him, spins him around. One lens of the man's eyeglasses is
text: cracked down the center.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Which way are the winds blowing?
speaker_heading: PEMBERTON
dialog: Wind? What? I...I don't...what?
speaker_heading: GRANGER
text: West. Prevailing winds are west.
dialog: The fallout will blow away from us.
dialog: 
text: Montag sees Granger on the ground, hands shaking before his
text: sightless eyes. He lets Pemberton go, comes over.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: Granger?
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: I'm blind, fireman. I saw the light.
text: Montag crouches, offers his hand, gentle:
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: I'll lead you.
text: Granger takes Montag's hand, squeezes it. His other hand finds
text: Montag's face, fingers seeking.
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: Lead? Yes, why not? The fireman
dialog: will lead.
speaker_heading: SYKES
dialog: Lead? Lead where? What are you
dialog: talking about?
text: Others are gathering. Clarisse appears, helping Montag get
text: Granger to his feet.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: The mines. You said they were deep.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: GRANGER
dialog: Pray they are. It's going to be a
dialog: long winter. Longer than we thought.
text: Montag glances around. A lot of faces are suddenly looking to
text: him, seeking answers or reassurance. Their fear and uncertainty
text: surround him.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
dialog: You heard him! Gather your things!
dialog: Help the injured! Grieve later!
dialog: We've got a long way to go! Move!
text: They do. People up and down the slope prepare to move on,
text: gathering their things, helping the injured.
text: Montag glances to Clarisse. She's clutching Granger's arn,
text: ready to help guide him.
speaker_heading: MONTAG
text: turns, taking one last look at his city, a hot wind still
text: rippling his clothes.
text: THE MUSHROOM CLOUD is rising higher and higher, godlike above
text: the fading glare, a roiling pillar of fire bellowing into the
dialog: heavens.
text: DISTANT FLASHES begin appearing here and there on the horizon.
text: More nuclear explosions, but much too far away to see.
text: AS CAMERA CLOSES IN on Montag, we hear him speaking his most
text: quiet and precious thoughts for the final time...
speaker_heading: MONTAG'S VOICE (V.0.)
text: Fire is bright. Fire is clean. Fire
text: sweeps away the clutter of the
dialog: past...and provides a bright and
dialog: shining future.
text: ...and as we END ON A FINAL TIGHT CLOSEUP, we see tiny
text: pinpoints of nuclear fire reflected in his eyes...
speaker_heading: MONTAG'S VOICE (V.0.)
dialog: It is good to burn. This is what I
dialog: have been taught. This is what I
dialog: know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It is all I need to know.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
