text: FADE IN :
scene_heading: 1 EXT SPACE (S) 1
text: An ever expanding infinity of light and color as CAMERA
text: 
text: TRAVELS THROUGH deep space, MOVING DIRECTLY for one
text: pinpoint of light: a STAR GROWING RAPIDLY as we SWEEP
text: TOWARD IT, a normal white star SUDDENLY CHANGING,
text: brightening, flaring unbelievable intensity: supernova.
text: The CAMERA HOLDS just a moment, then MOVES on, SEARCH-
text: ING through space, the jeweled beauty of other star
text: systems, sparkling nebulae, swirling hydrogen clouds.
text: STILL MOVING, then CAMERA FINDS:
scene_heading: 2 EXT. AREA OF LUMINESCENCE (S) 2
text: In the far distance, slowly growing in size as CAMERA
text: APPROACHES: it resembles, vaguely at this distance, an
text: Aurora Borealis: flaring colors from the fringes,
dialog: beautiful yet ominous. It is so large, this Cloud, it
dialog: can envelope an entire solar system. CAMERA CONTINUES
text: APPROACHING the Cloud, and then suddenly, crossing
dialog: our POV, a:
text: 
speaker_heading: 3 KLINGON HEAVY CRUISER (S) 3
text: In a graceful, turning arc toward the mysterious
text: LUMINESCENCE. CAMERA FOLLOWS this Klingon, then FINDS
text: a second Klingon cruiser, also turning toward the Cloud,
dialog: which continues to grow in size as the Klingons
text: approach at warp speed, CAMERA CLOSING on the lead
text: ship, until the vessel's detail can be clearly MADE
text: OUT: lights, weaponry, power systems, identification
text: emblazoned on the nacelles and saucer in Klingon
dialog: language (and symbols).
scene_heading: 4 INT. KLINGON CRUISER BRIDGE (O) 4
text: Clearly alien, an ODD-SOUNDING KLAXON signaling
text: "battle stations." Orders issued in KLINGON LANGUAGE,
text: the KLINGON CAPTAIN and EXEC peering at an unusual
text: bridge viewer at the huge area of LUMINESCENT HAZE
text: directly ahead. In KLINGON DIALOGUE:
speaker_heading: KLINGON CAPTAIN
dialog: (Give me tactical.)
speaker_heading: 5 CLOSE - MAIN VIEWER (O) 5
text: goes suddenly to a TACTICAL GRID SYSTEM, showing the
text: LUMINESCENT HAZE to be an ENORMOUS BLIP OF LIGHT ON
text: THE SCREEN, with two TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT complete-
text: ing their turn on a direct course toward it.
scene_heading: 6 EXT. SPACE - THE KLINGON PATROL AND THE HAZE (S) 6
text: The Patrol is clearly SEEN now on the right of the
text: bottom of the FRAME... THREE tiny ships closing on the
text: 
text: steadily growing LUMINESCENT HAZE.
scene_heading: 7 INT. THE KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC (O) 7
text: All eyes on the viewer that shows the ships sweeping
dialog: on the Mysterious cloud.
speaker_heading: KLINGON CAPTAIN
dialog: (In Klingonese)
dialog: Visual.
text: The TECHNICIAN makes the switch.
scene_heading: 8 CLOSE - VIEW SCREEN - LUMINESCENT HAZE (O) 8
text: growing ever larger, its flaring colors menacing,
text: mysterious, strangely beckoning.
scene_heading: 9 INT. BRIDGE - KLINGON COMMAND CRUISER 9
text: The crew stands by for battle.
text: 
speaker_heading: KLINGON CAPTAIN
dialog: (In Klingonese)
dialog: Tactical again. Stand by on
dialog: torpedoes.
scene_heading: 10 EAT SPACE - LEAD KLINGON VESSEL (TORPEDO HATCH) (S) 10
text: sliding open, the glowing "Hell Fire" of the Photon
text: Launch tubes, slowly revealed.
text: 11 VERY WIDE ANGLE - THE THREE SHIPS (S) 11
text: They are tiny, insect-like shapes moving still CLOSER
text: to the Luminescent Cloud, so large now that it begins
text: to dominate all space behind.
scene_heading: 12 INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID - CAPTAIN AND 12
speaker_heading: EXEC (O)
text: The growing nearness and enormous size of the Cloud
dialog: also reflected on the Tactical Grid, somehow more
text: awesome by this schematic view. The Captain gestures
dialog: the order to "FIRE."
scene_heading: 13 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL - TORPEDO HATCH (S) 13
text: The BRILLIANT PHOTON BLOBS of the torpedoes spurt from
dialog: the tubes.
text: 14 ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL (S) 14
text: A deadly PHOTON TORPEDO pattern racing away from the
text: Klingon and toward the Luminescent glow in the distance.
scene_heading: 15 INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID (O) 15
text: Three torpedoes are heading directly toward the Cloud.
text: Suddenly they glow briefly and disappear long before
text: they reach their intended target.
scene_heading: 16 INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC 16
dialog: incredulous that their torpedoes have disappeared
dialog: without a trace.
scene_heading: 17 EXT SPACE - THE CLOUD - THREE KLINGON SHIPS (S) 17
text: as the second and third ships launch torpedoes toward
text: the color-flaring surface of the cloud. This time we
text: have an outside, real VIEW of the torpedoes glowing
text: brightly and then disappearing with no effect.
scene_heading: 18 INT. KLINGON BRIDGE (O) 18
text: The Klingon crew grim, desperate, watching a BRIGHT
text: STACCATO BLIP OF POWER from within the LUMINESCENCE.
speaker_heading: KLINGON CAPTAIN
dialog: (quickly; Klingonese)
dialog: Full force fields; evasive
dialog: maneuvers.
text: 19 EAT SPACE - THE CLOUD - THE KLINGON PATROLS (S) 19
text: Out of the LUMINESCENCE hurtles a FRIGHTENING WHIPLASH
text: OF ENERGY. It bears down on the Klingon Patrol, now
text: in an evasive maneuver. Then the WHIPLASH BOLT hits
text: the third cruiser in a writhing flare of energy which
text: totally engulfs the vessel.
text: The other two ships veer off, warping around again into
text: attack position. The THIRD SHIP has begun to implode
dialog: in on itself, the matter-energy of its existence
text: drained by the WHIPLASH BOLT that HOLDS IT.
text: 20 ANGLE ON REMAINING KLINGON CRUISERS (S) 20
text: desperately defending themselves, FORCE FIELDS FULL UP,
text: RAPIDLY FIRING PHOTON TORPEDOES. But now a SECOND
text: WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT has emerged from the cloud and
text: hits the second vessel, DESTROYING it.
text: The THIRD WHIPLASH BOLT glances off the surviving
text: Cruiser as the ship retreats in a wide, evasive turn,
text: FIRING from stern tubes.
scene_heading: 21 INT. KLINGON BRIDGE 21
text: The bridge shattered; Klingon bodies. The mortally-
text: wounded Captain is transmitting urgently:
speaker_heading: KLINGON CAPTAIN
dialog: (In Klingonese)
dialog: ... severely damaged. Returning
dialog: fire...
scene_heading: 22 EXT. SPACE - STARFLEET MONITOR STATION EPSILON 9 (S) 22
text: Serenity here. A barren, rocky small plantoid softly
text: lit by the myriad stars. This is a small Starfleet
text: outpost, antennae sprouting everywhere. Tiny figures
dialog: (WORKERS) servicing one antenna illustrate the size
text: of the installation.
scene_heading: 23 INT. EPSILON 9 - MONITOR ROOM - A VIEWER (O) 23
text: SHOWING the battle scene, and the VOICE OF THE KLINGON
text: CAPTAIN in his last stand against the Object; his VOICE
text: is weary, almost mechanical. On the adjacent viewer,
text: an English printout of the Klingon's words chatters
text: along the bottom of the picture:
speaker_heading: KLINGON CAPTAIN
dialog: (In Klingonese)
dialog: Imperial Klingon Cruiser Amar...
dialog: severely damaged by unfamiliar
text: weaponry... intruder unidentified..
text: 24 WIDER ANGLE - EPSILON 9 STARFLEET PERSONNEL AND VIEWER (O) 24
text: At the viewers are a FEMALE LIEUTENANT and FOUR TECH-
text: NICIANS. COMMANDER BRANCH, a young, alert, enters hur-
text: riedly, scans he console.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: Our sensor drone is intercepting
dialog: this on Quad L-14.
speaker_heading: KLINGON CAPTAIN (V.O.)
dialog: ... believe luminescent cloud
dialog: to be enormous power field
text: surrounding alien vessel...
dialog: size and description unknown..
dialog: our sensor scans unable to
dialog: penetrate. Imperial Klingon
dialog: Cruiser Amar... continuing
text: to attack.
speaker_heading: BRANCH
dialog: That's within Klingon boundaries.
dialog: Who are they fighting?
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: Unknown, sir.
text: A violent EXPLOSION inside the Klingon bridge -- Klingon
text: Captain's body is thrown violently against the bulkhead.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: I have an exterior visual!
text: 25 CLOSE ON VIEWER (O) 25
text: showing EXTERIOR of the Klingon vessel: a final,
text: frightening WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT strikes it -- then
text: the same awesome IMPLOSION INTO FIREBALL.
text: 26 WIDER ANGLE - PERSONNEL AND VIEWER (O) 26
text: The Starfleet station onlookers react to the utter
text: annihilation of the huge cruiser. And now, past where
text: the cruiser just disappeared -- the mysterious LUMINES-
text: CENCE approaching in distance. Technician hits a
text: switch, magnifying the strange CLOUD.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: We've plotted a course on that
dialog: cloud, Commander: it will pass
dialog: into Federation Space fairly
dialog: close to us.
speaker_heading: BRANCH
dialog: Heading?
text: 27 CLOSE ON THE MAIN MONITOR STATION (O) 27
text: as its focal point shifts to the huge elliptically-
text: shaped LUMINESCENCE racing across the sky. MUSIC
text: (V'GER THEME) COMMENCES in a low, unresolved CHORD
text: that remains in the background through the remainder
text: of this scene, and the beginning of the next one.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT'S VOICE
dialog: Sir, it's on a precise heading
dialog: for Earth.
text: Ominously now the LUMINESCENCE increases in size, and
text: begins to fill the viewer. HOLD A MOMENT, and then:
scene_heading: 28 EXT. SURFACE OF PLANET VULCAN - DAY (M) 28
text: with the CAMERA MOVING THROUGH masses of thick, steamy
text: vaporous clouds, swirling about, rising boilingly up
text: from some unseen, underground source. The CAMERA
text: CONTINUES MOVING through clouds.
text: And then... the Vulcan landscape. Harsh, strange
text: angular peaks and rock formations -- the barren, legend-
dialog: ary mountain home of Vulcan Masters.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. VULCAN LEDGE - SPOCK ( M & F.P.) 29
text: Spock's lean features instantly recognizable despite
text: unkempt, longer hair and the fatigue born of a long,
text: harsh discipline he has undergone. His robes, tattered
dialog: and dust covered, are that of a Vulcan Aspirant in
dialog: study with the Masters. Under the V'ger THEME MUSIC
text: we HEAR a VOICE in ritual tones:
speaker_heading: FEMALE MASTER'S VOICE
dialog: Spock, son of Sarek of Vulcan...
dialog: and of Amanda of Earth...
dialog: diligently you have labored for
dialog: purification of mind...
text: 30 REVERSE ANGLE - SPOCK, VULCAN MASTERS AND RUINS 30
text: In b.g., gigantic ancient Vulcan statues and ruins. In f.g.,
text: the stone platform on which Spock stands facing a semi-circle
text: of three similar platforms. On them in regal robes are three
text: VULCAN MASTERS. The Master in the center is a female, the
text: other two Masters are male. The elderly female is holding a
text: cord and ancient pendant as if ready to place it around
text: 
text: Spock's neck at an appropriate moment. Spock is staring up
text: as V'ger THEME MUSIC fades.
speaker_heading: MALE MASTER
dialog: (chidingly)
dialog: Spock . . . !
text: Spock turns, giving a small contrite nod -- the ritual
text: continues.
speaker_heading: FEMALE MASTER
dialog: Here are these sands, our fore-
dialog: bearers cast out their animal
dialog: passions. Here our race was
dialog: saved by the first attainment of
dialog: Kolinahr.
text: 
speaker_heading: MALE MASTER
dialog: Kolinahr: the final shedding of
dialog: all emotion.
speaker_heading: FEMALE MASTER
dialog: You have labored long, Spock.
dialog: Now receive from us this symbol
dialog: of total logic.
text: Spock starts to kneel... the Female Master moves in,
text: intending to put the ancient pendant around his neck.
text: But Spock now hesitates -- he's troubled as though
dialog: uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the
text: pendant away. Then, a faint reprise of the V'ger THEME
text: MUSIC now causes the Female Master to look skyward.
text: She turns from this back to Spock as she exchanges a
dialog: look with the Male Masters.
speaker_heading: FEMALE MASTER
dialog: (gestures Spock forward)
dialog: Come, give me your thoughts.
text: She kneels with Spock -- lays her hands on his temples
text: in Vulcan mind-meld position.
speaker_heading: FEMALE MASTER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Our minds, Spock... One and
dialog: together....
text: Their eyes close -- their minds meld -- then her head
text: jerks slightly, her features change as her mind feels
text: Spock's reactions to the V'ger consciousness. A long
text: moment, then she opens her eyes, gets to her feet and
text: looks down on the still kneeling Spock. Then, she
text: casts aside the pendant she carries -- it falls into
dialog: the dust.
speaker_heading: FEMALE MASTER
dialog: (continuing; sadly)
dialog: This consciousness which calls --
dialog: it stirs your human half, Spock?
dialog: You have not achieved Kolinahr --
dialog: Your human emotions are not fully
dialog: extinguished.
dialog: (turns to the other Masters)
dialog: He will not achieve his goal with
dialog: us. His answer lies elsewhere.
text: The three Masters leave -- Spock watches them go, his
text: disappointment evident even in his stoic features.
text: 31 MED. ANGLE ON SPOCK (M. & F.P.) 31
text: CAMERA CLOSES IN on his face as we again HEAR a frag-
text: ment of V'ger THEME MUSIC -- Spock again raises his
text: head and peers up into the heavens. HOLD on his face
dialog: a moment, then...
text: SHOCK CUT TO :
scene_heading: 32 EXT. EARTH - AN AIR TRAM - DAY (S) 32
text: gleaming silver in the sun as it streaks TOWARD THE
text: CAMERA POSITION and hurtles PAST.
scene_heading: 33 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - HILLTOP AIR TRAM STATION - 33
speaker_heading: DAY (M)
text: From this vantage, we can SEE all of twenty-third
dialog: century San Francisco stretched out before us. In
text: the b.g., the familiar forms of the carefully preserved
dialog: Golden Gate Bridge and Transamerica Pyramid Building
dialog: serve as our only reminders that this is, indeed, San
dialog: Francisco.
text: The AIR TRAM (an anti-gravitational train flying
text: several feet above the ground) DECELERATES sharply,
text: settles to the ground with a whisper.
scene_heading: 34 EXT. TRAM STATION - CLOSE ON TRAM DOORS - DAY 34
text: The doors opening, and various TRAVELERS (civilians
text: and Starfleet personnel) leaving the tram, striding
text: onto the platform, continuing on their respective
text: ways. Among the departing throng:
speaker_heading: 35 KIRK 35
text: in Admiral's uniform, grim, determined, moving through
text: the throng. Now and then Starfleet officers nod re-
text: spectfully; KIRK responds with detached formality; his
text: mind is clearly set on something he is resolved to ac-
dialog: complish here in headquarters -- whatever the cost.
text: CAMERA WITH HIM, to:
scene_heading: 36 INT. AIR TRAM STATION - DAY ` 36
text: as Kirk strides into the graceful Starfleet HQ building.
text: Many PEOPLE are about, civilians and uniformed person-
dialog: nel; most of them with some air of urgency. (NOTE:
text: ALIENS interspersed among them, Vulcans, blue-skinned
text: Andorians, high-domed Vegans, ect.) Kirk continues on
text: when suddenly he reacts, annoyed as he sees:
speaker_heading: 37 SONAK 37
dialog: a Vulcan, Lt Commander; short, white-haired, grizzled,
text: hurrying along. Kirk calls to him:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Commander Sonak... !
text: SONAK turns with Vulcan imperturbability to face Kirk
text: who steps toward him
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You've received your appointment
dialog: as Enterprise Science Officer?
speaker_heading: SONAK
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Based, I am told, on your
dialog: recommendation, Admiral. Thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Why aren't you on board?
speaker_heading: SONAK
dialog: Captain Decker requested I complete
dialog: final Science briefing here before...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Here at Starfleet...? The
dialog: Enterprise is in final preparation
dialog: to leave dock...
speaker_heading: SONAK
dialog: Which will require twenty more
dialog: hours at minimum, Admiral...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting
dialog: with Admiral Nogura which will not
dialog: last more than three minutes.
dialog: Report to me on the Enterprise in
dialog: one hour.
speaker_heading: SONAK
dialog: To you, sir?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I intend to be there following
dialog: that meeting. Report to me. One
dialog: hour!
text: And Kirk turns, strides purposefully away. Sonak gazes
text: after him, one eyebrow raised quizzically.
scene_heading: 38 EXT. EARTH ORBIT (S) 38
text: In f.g., Orbital drydock offices, rotating slowly but
text: perceptibly against blue-black of space. Small figures
text: in spacesuits working on construction, with work belts.
text: Beyond and below... Earth. In the far distance we can
text: barely make out an orbital drydock.
speaker_heading: 39 CLOSER ANGLE - ORBITAL OFFICE CLUSTER (S) 39
dialog: The cluster is a fully-equipped dockyard engineering
text: center and computer drafting office.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN AND CENTERS ON an outer "Travel Pod."
scene_heading: 40 INT. INNER OFFICE (O) 40
dialog: an installation which also includes a double position
text: transporter, in which we SEE the TRANSPORTER EFFECT
text: BEGIN. With the TRANSPORTER CREW IS SCOTT. He's with
text: a Technician, busy with a piece of complex circuitry.
text: Then he turns, sees that it is Kirk BEAMING in here.
text: As Kirk materializes, steps off the transporter plat-
text: form, Scott moves quickly to him.
dialog: 40A KIRK AND SCOTT 40A
text: The starship Engineering Officer clearly surprised to
text: see Kirk here. Kirk has the same look of grim de-
dialog: termination we just saw in the headquarters building.
text: 
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Admiral, I've been hoping to see
dialog: you. Maybe you can get through
dialog: to those thick heads in Starfleet
dialog: that...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Why aren't the Enterprise
dialog: transporters in operation, Mister
dialog: Scott?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: We're hoping it's only a temporary
dialog: problem, Admiral...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: See that it is.
dialog: (moving toward pod)
dialog: Take me over, please.
text: Scott is now eying Kirk just a little warily as he fol-
text: lows him into the pod. Kirk's determined expression
dialog: suggests that some chips are going to fly and Scott
dialog: does not want to become one of them.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Admiral, the Enterprise has just
dialog: finished eighteen months redesign-
dialog: ing and refitting. She needs
dialog: testing, a shakedown...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Mr. Scott, there's an alien object
dialog: with unbelievable destructive
dialog: power less than three days away
dialog: from this planet...
text: Kirk hits a button on the travel pod panel -- the air-
text: lock doors SLAM closed behind them. Then, stepping im-
text: mediately to the front observation window:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... the only Starship in
dialog: interception range is the
dialog: Enterprise! Ready, or not, she
dialog: launches in twelve hours!
text: Scott throws Kirk an appalled look but is now occupied
dialog: in sealing the Outer Pod door and manipulating drive
text: controls.
text: CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL front of the
text: Pod and arms of the office complex as Pod disconnects
text: and starts to move.
scene_heading: 40C EXT. POD 40C
text: CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL front of the
text: pod and arms of the office complex as Pod disconnects
text: and starts moving.
scene_heading: 41 EXT. EARTH ORBIT - ANGLES ON TRAVEL POD (S) 41
dialog: - -
dialog: 43 43
text: 
text: as it moves way from the office complex. We can
text: SEE the jet flames of its tiny thrusters as it cir-
text: cles around, heads off (toward the distant Orbital
dialog: dry dock).
scene_heading: 44 INT. TRAVEL POD - KIRK AND SCOTT 44
text: Scott nervously eying Kirk, and finally deciding to
dialog: make one more effort:
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: The crew hasn't had near enough
dialog: transition time with all the new
dialog: equipment. And the engines,
dialog: Admiral: they've yet to be even
dialog: tested at warp power. Add to
dialog: that, an untried Captain...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (hint of smile)
dialog: Two and a half years as Chief of
dialog: Starfleet Operations may have
dialog: made me a little stale, Mr. Scott
dialog: -- but I wouldn't exactly consider
dialog: myself 'untried.'
text: It takes Scott a moment to comprehend, and Kirk smiles
dialog: now, nods:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: They gave her back to me, Scotty.
text: Scott peers at him, genuinely surprised -- and pleased.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: "Gave' her back, sir...? I doubt
dialog: it was that easy...
dialog: (returns smile)
dialog: But any man who could manage such
dialog: a feat, I wouldna dare disappoint.
dialog: She'll launch on time, sir...
dialog: (with confidence)
dialog: And she'll be ready.
text: And he clasps Kirk's elbow affectionately, then gestures
text: Kirk to look out the pod window.
scene_heading: 45 EXT. OUTSIDE THE POD WINDOW - KIRK'S POV (O) 45
text: as he looks out: the blue-black of orbital space.
scene_heading: 46 INT. TRAVEL POD 46
text: Scott is well aware of what the Enterprise means to
text: Kirk. As Scott maneuvers the pod to provide the best
text: perspective, Kirk peers through the observation window,
text: craning his head, hungry for his first glimpse of the
text: starship. Scott is watching him, immensely pleased.
text: 47 PAST THEM TO THE POD WINDOW (O) 47
text: as we SEE the drydock and more of its detail, and a
text: hint of what is inside.
scene_heading: 48 EXT. EARTH ORBIT - OTHER ANGLES FROM THE POD (O) 48
dialog: - -
text: 
dialog: 50 50
text: 
text: PAST Kirk and Scott the corner of the drydock becomes
text: larger -- we begin SEEING more of it. And then the
text: merest glimpse of what is inside the drydock: The
text: Enterprise slips INTO VIEW.
scene_heading: 51 INT. POD - VERY CLOSE ON KIRK AT WINDOW 51
text: as he watches, his face reflecting all of it: the awe,
dialog: the wonder, the romance, the obsession. The one comp-
dialog: lete love of his life. And with that love regained,
text: he is becoming more fully alive again.
text: Kirk looks at Scott; for a moment both hold each other's
text: eye. Scott knows precisely how Kirk feels. Both turn
text: to the window again.
text: 52 WHAT THEY SEE - THE ENTERPRISE (S) 52
text: Now DOMINATING the SCREEN -- the awesome, symmetrical
text: bulk of the starship comes fully INTO VIEW. And it
text: dominates Kirk's -- and our emotions.
scene_heading: 53 EXT. THE ENTERPRISE - AND THE POD (TINY IN THIS SHOT) 53
dialog: - -
text: 56 AS IT CIRCLES - THE ANTI-LIKE FIGURES OF WORKERS (S) 56
text: The great ship dwarfs everything. The drydock becomes
text: a fragile filigree framing the ship's great curved
text: bulk. The tiny pod continues to move along it.
text: Small automated welding devices move along the gird-
text: ers, working with brief, bright orange-white flares.
dialog: In other areas of metal lace structure, supplies and
text: equipment are being loaded onto the ship. The pod
text: continues moving (Scott is giving Kirk time to see all),
text: watched carefully by the TINY FIGURES OF SUPERVISING
text: TECHNICIANS on the drydock. Now the pod moves toward
text: mating position. It closes in, secures itself to the
text: outer airlock.
scene_heading: 57 INT. POD - AT THE AIRLOCK 57
dialog: Scott completing the mating procedure, Kirk turning
text: from the observation window. Outside, the metallic..
text: CLICK of the pod locking onto the airlock. Now the
text: "WHOOSH" of the latch doors securing, the CLANG of
dialog: security bolts. It's all been a rare and delicious
text: moment for Kirk, and his face shows it.
text: OVER the POD INTERCOM we HEAR, "Pod secured. Pressure
text: equalized." Scott moves the control to open the hatch.
scene_heading: 58 INT. ENTERPRISE CARGO DECK (M) 58
text: A confusion of organized work and VOICES. The cargo
text: deck bustles with activity; supplies and equipment
dialog: being stored and installed.
scene_heading: 59 INT. CARGO DECK - BALCONY AND CATWALK 59
text: Kirk and Scott are met by a nervous, perspiring
speaker_heading: ENSIGN.
speaker_heading: KIRK AND SCOTT
dialog: Permission to come aboard, sir...?
speaker_heading: ENSIGN
dialog: Granted, sir. Welcome aboard,
dialog: Admiral... Commander Scott,
dialog: you're needed in Engineering
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (to Kirk)
dialog: Sir, you'll excuse me...?
text: Kirk gestures him to leave, and Scott hurries away.
text: Kirk stands a moment, gazing down at the cargo deck.
text: 60 ANGLE DOWN PAST KIRK TO FLOOR (M) 60
text: The crew maneuvering antigravity devices which move
text: heavy containers -- scrambles of activity at storage
text: holds and maintenance lockers.
text: 61 CLOSE ON KIRK AND ENSIGN 61
text: Kirk is drinking it all in. He's home.
speaker_heading: ENSIGN
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Sir, if you'll follow me, I'll...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I think I can find my way,
dialog: Ensign.
text: And Kirk moves off, leaving the Ensign gazing at him,
dialog: relieved.
scene_heading: 62 EXT. ELEVATOR AND CATWALK 62
text: Kirk ENTERS ANGLE and the doors snap open.
scene_heading: 63 INT. ELEVATOR 63
text: as Kirk enters. The doors close. Kirk waits a beat,
text: savoring this moment too. Then, firmly to the control
text: panel:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Bridge!
text: The turbo-elevator HUMS WITH POWER as it begins hur-
text: tling up. On the wall back of Kirk we SEE an electronic
text: diagram of the Enterprise tracking the elevator's
dialog: speedy trip to the Bridge.
scene_heading: 64 INT. BRIDGE 64
text: A confusion of activity and VOICES. Pieces o equip-
text: ment in a state of disarray: consoles open, fiber
text: optic tubes unconnected, viewing screens dismantled.
text: It's a frantic, desperate scene -- a ship and crew to-
text: tally unprepared. In the midst of this: ALIEN
text: ensign is assisting UHURA (Lt. Comdr. stripes)deftly
text: working her communications station, AD LIBBING
dialog: "... Hailing frequency four, check. Hailing frequency
dialog: five, will someone please check me?" At the helm,
text: sweat-soaked SULU (Lt. Comdr stripes) has a service
text: plate open, is peering inside to make delicate adjust-
dialog: ments, AD LIBBING "... Helm, now give me a reading on
dialog: four point zero zero six of full." And at the Weapons
text: Control, CHEKOV (Full Lt.)argues with TECHNICIANS who
dialog: insist photon torpedoes read "ready" while Chekov
dialog: argues the computer is not relaying that information.
text: 65 ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS 65
text: snapping open -- and there is Kirk. For the moment no
text: one notices him, and he stands watching, remembering.
text: And then he moves forward toward the command center.
text: 66 ACROSS UHURA TO KIRK 66
text: as she is the first to see him. She reacts,pleased.
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: Captain... Starfleet just
dialog: signaled your transfer-of-
dialog: command orders!
text: 67 ANOTHER ANGLE - VARIOUS REACTION 67
text: as everyone else is suddenly aware of Kirk.
text: All work stops, with various AD LIBBED greetings from
dialog: the old crew: "Admiral Kirk..." "It's the Captain...!"
text: etc., etc. But most sit or stand, simple gaping at
text: Kirk, all quite awed. The old hands, Uhura, Sulu, and
text: Chekov start converging on Kirk. But he gestures them
text: back, speaking crisply.
text: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I appreciate the welcome; I wish
dialog: the circumstances were less
dialog: critical.
dialog: (to Uhura)
dialog: Epsilon Nine is monitoring the
dialog: intruder; keep a channel open to
dialog: them.
dialog: (glances around)
dialog: Where is Captain Decker?
speaker_heading: SULU
dialog: He's in Engineering, sir...
dialog: (uncomfortable,
dialog: indicates Captain's
dialog: chair)
dialog: He doesn't know.
text: Kirk reacts with some exasperation, starts away,
dialog: addresses Chekov:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Mr Chekov, assemble the crew on
dialog: the Rec Deck at 0400 hours. I
dialog: want to show them what we're
text: facing.
text: And Kirk moves to the elevator, enters, is gone. The
text: moment the elevator doors snap closed:
speaker_heading: SULU
dialog: I wouldn't have wanted to have
text: been standing in his way. He
dialog: wanted her back; he got her!
speaker_heading: ALIEN ENSIGN
dialog: (perturbed)
dialog: And Captain Decker? He's been
dialog: with the ship every minute of
dialog: her refitting...
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: (brittle)
dialog: Ensign -- our chances of coming
dialog: back from this mission in one
dialog: piece may have just doubled...!

scene_heading: 70 INT. ENGINEERING SECTION 70
text: The entire complex a beehive of pre-departure activity.
dialog: ENGINEERING PERSONNEL (at least a third of them female)
dialog: coming and going, the platform-elevators (small, one-
text: man lifts to various levels) busy. A gentle but con-
text: stant HUM and WHIRR flows from the engine core, to indi-
dialog: cate a pre-idling mode. There will be continual AD
text: LIBBED conversation among the Technicians.
text: Now the Engine Room door opens and Kirk steps into the
text: area. He stands a moment observing the activity. a
text: grizzled ENGINEERING CHIEF pushes a huge condenser on
text: an anti-grav device past irk with a respectful "watch
text: it, sir" admonishment. Kirk moves on to:
text: 71 THE INTERMIX CHAMBER 71
text: at the middle of the power shaft. Very NOISY here,
text: and a continual CACOPHONY of COMPUTERIZED AND HUMAN
text: VOICES calling off equipment checks. And grouped
text: around a section of burnt-out circuitry are WILLARD
text: DECKER, Captain's stripes, handsome, in his early
dialog: 30's; Scott, and two Technicians. Decker and Scott
text: are working feverishly uncoupling the device,
text: probing its innards. Decker has discovered the problem,
dialog: removed several transistor-type parts, taps them
text: with a pencil-sized sonic analyzer.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (quietly elated)
dialog: I thought so! See... the trans-
dialog: porter sensor was not activated...
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Aye, you were dead right about
dialog: that...
dialog: (to Technician)
dialog: Clearly, put a back-up sensor into
dialog: the unit.
text: 72 ACROSS THEM TO KIRK 72
text: as the Technician prepares to install the device,
text: Scott glances up to see Kirk.
text: He looks from Decker to Kirk in acute embarrassment
dialog: (so that we should realize Scott hasn't mentioned
text: Kirk's taking over to Decker). Decker now notices
text: Kirk, reacts pleased.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Admiral Kirk...
dialog: (shakes Kirk's hand)
dialog: We're getting a top brass send
dialog: off...?
dialog: (self assured grin)
dialog: She'll launch on schedule if we
dialog: have to tow her out with our bare
dialog: hands. Right, Scotty?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: (lamely)
dialog: Aye, sir, that we will...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (to Decker)
dialog: Will, let's go over here and
dialog: talk.
text: He indicates corner. Decker glances bemusedly at
text: Kirk, then turns to Scott:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Let me now when the back-up is
text: in place.
text: 73 ACROSS SCOTT TO KIRK AND DECKER 73
text: as Scott AD LIBS a glum "Aye, sir," and watches them
text: walk across the Chamber.
text: 74 A CORNER OF THE INTERMIX CHAMBER 74
text: just a little quieter here, with Kirk and Decker arriv-
dialog: ing, and Decker saying blithely:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: All due respect, sir, I hope
dialog: this isn't a Starfleet pep talk;
dialog: I'm just too busy.
text: Kirk eyes Decker -- then decides the best way to say
text: it is plainly, directly.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I'm taking over the Center seat.
dialog: I'm sorry, Will.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: You are what...?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I'm replacing you as Captain of
dialog: the Enterprise.
text: Decker seems shocked into silence; he can only peer
text: at Kirk who reaches tentatively as though to clasp a
text: paternal hand on Decker's shoulder, then withdraws it
text: and continues quickly.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You'll stay aboard as Executive
dialog: Officer... a temporary grade
dialog: reduction to Commander.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (finding his voice)
dialog: -- You, personally, are assuming
dialog: command?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: May I ask Why?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (nods)
dialog: My experience -- five years out
dialog: there dealing with unknowns like
dialog: this -- my familiarity with the
dialog: Enterprise, this crew...
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Admiral, this is an almost totally
dialog: new enterprise. You don't know
dialog: her a tenth as well as I do.
text: 75 ANOTHER ANGLE - TO SHOW SCOTT IN B.G. (ACROSS THE 75
dialog: ROOM)
text: Scott, working on the relay, but continually glancing
text: at Kirk and Decker with worried concern, as Kirk
text: replies:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: That's why you're staying aboard.
dialog: I'm sorry, Will.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: No, Admiral. I don't think you are;
dialog: not one damned bit. I remember
dialog: when you recommended me for this
dialog: command. You told me how envious
dialog: you were, and if only you could
dialog: find a way to get a starship
dialog: command again. Well, sir, it looks
dialog: like you found a way.
text: Kirk is silent a moment, peering levelly at Decker,
text: who returns the gaze with equal intensity. Then:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Report to the bridge, Commander.
dialog: Immediately.
text: Decker EXITS. Kirk waits, collecting his composure
text: as he watches him go. Then Kirk turns to glare at
text: Scott. Interrupted by a flare as something shorts
dialog: out at the mechanism where Scott and Decker had been
text: working. Technician (Clearly) reacts, hits an inter-
dialog: com button fast:
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN (CLEARY)
dialog: Transporter room, come in!
dialog: Urgent!
dialog: (to Scott)
text: Redline on the transporters,
dialog: Mister Scott!
text: Scott whirls to a console fast, speaks urgently!
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Transporter room, do not engage!
dialog: Do not....
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN (CLEARY)
dialog: (reacting to the reading;
dialog: interruption)
dialog: Too late; they're beaming now!
text: Kirk is exiting on a run, followed by Scott.
scene_heading: 76 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - INCLUDING TRANSPORTER CHAMBER 76
dialog: (O)
text: An unusually defective looking TRANSPORTER EFFECT in
text: progress, alternately flashing and glowing -- even the
text: Transporter SOUND seems wrong, as if struggling to
text: overcome some problem. At the console, CHIEF RAND and
text: ASSISTANT are reacting in surprised, near-horror as
text: they attempt vainly to save the situation.
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (into intercom)
dialog: Starfleet, override us!
dialog: OVERRIDE...! Yank them back!
text: Suddenly, from Rand's console,a VIOLENT GLARE -- a
text: PROTESTING SOUND from the circuitry. And on the con-
text: sole a red-warning light now begins flashing.
speaker_heading: STARFLEET VOICE
text: Unable to retrieve their pattern,
dialog: Enterprise....!
text: Rand reacts in real horror now as human forms begin to
text: FAINTLY MATERIALIZE, then FADE AWAY, then REAPPEAR IN
text: FAINTLY MISSHAPEN FORM as she frantically works con-
text: trols. Kirk ENTERS fast, steps to the console to
text: assist Rand; Scott has also come in and moves to the
text: console, brushes aside the Asst. Chief, and begins
text: manipulating the additional controls himself.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: We're losing the pattern...!
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (into intercom)
dialog: Starfleet, boost your matter gain;
dialog: we need more signal!
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: Oh, no! They're forming!
text: 77 CLOSER ON THE TRANSPORTER CHAMBER (O) 77
text: with the human forms FLUTTERING INTO FULLER AND FULLER
text: MATERIALIZATION, FRIGHTENINGLY, HORRIBLY MISSHAPEN. We
text: RECOGNIZE one form as the Vulcan, Sonak -- the other a
text: human WOMAN. They MATERIALIZE; we HEAR A MOAN form
text: from the Vulcan -- the Woman's SCREAM OF PAIN. Then,
text: all at once, the half-materialized bodies are gone;
text: the transporter chamber is empty.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, my God...!
text: 78 KIRK, SCOTT AND RAND 78
text: gazing, horrified, at the empty chamber.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (into intercom)
dialog: Starfleet, do you have them?
text: A mutter of utter, vacant silence -- and Kirk and
text: Scott look at each other again, their pained faces
dialog: presaging the answer they already know:
speaker_heading: STARFLEET VOICE
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: Enterprise... what we got back
dialog: didn't live long. Fortunately.
text: Another moment of stunned silence, and then Kirk hits
text: the transmission button -- fighting to control his
dialog: voice as:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Starfleet... Kirk. Please...
dialog: express my condolences to their
dialog: families. Commander Sonak's
dialog: can be reached through the Vulcan
dialog: Embassy.
dialog: (see Rand's stricken
dialog: expression)
dialog: There was nothing you could have
dialog: done, Rand. It wasn't your fault.
text: And before Rand can answer, Kirk leaves the room.
scene_heading: 79 INT. CORRIDOR - TRAVELING WITH KIRK 79
text: as Kirk steps out, and the doors snap closed behind
text: him. In the corridor the furor of the hurried depar-
text: ture is, as everywhere, quite evident: CREW MEMBERS
text: move back and forth. But Kirk does not see them; his
text: mind is tormented by the transporter accident -- was
dialog: there something he should have done, could have done,
dialog: to prevent it? Should he launch on schedule with the
dialog: starship this unready? Has he done right in yielding
dialog: to this terrible needs for starship command again,
dialog: forcing Starfleet to give her to him? Would Decker's
dialog: knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci-
dialog: dent?
text: Kirk reaches a corridor intersection, looks around,
text: realizes he's lost track of where he is. A passing
text: YEOMAN stops in response to his puzzled expression.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Turboshaft eight...?
speaker_heading: YEOMAN
dialog: Back that way, sir.
text: She's indicating back the direction from which Kirk
text: came. He nods his thanks, turns and moves back down
text: the corridor.
dialog: 80 DECKER 80
text: hurrying down the corridor. The two face each other
text: a silent moment, Decker studying Kirk curiously.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: We'll have to replace Commander
dialog: Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan
dialog: there, if possible...
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: None available, Captain. There's
dialog: no one in fact, who's fully rated
dialog: on this design.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You are, Mister Decker. I'm
dialog: afraid you'll have to double as
dialog: Science Officer.
text: And Kirk moves on, Decker stands gazing reflectively
text: after him.
speaker_heading: 81 OMITTED 81

text: 85 CLOSE - FULL SHOT OF THE KLINGON SHIP BEING DESTROYED 85
dialog: (AS SEEN ON VIEWER) (O)
text: 
dialog: (in the last part of the scene which showed the Klingon
text: Captain speaking in Klingonese and an English print-
text: out interpretation appearing at the screen bottom.
dialog: The Klingon ship nearly totaled; one engine nacelle
text: gone, smoke and flame spewing from the other, etc.
text: And then that final WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT STRIKING AND
dialog: SPECTACULARLY DESTROYING THE SHIP, etc.)
text: But this time, O.S., we HEAR GASPS of incredulity from
text: many throats (an audience), and various AD LIBBED com-
dialog: ments: "My God...!" "I don't believe it...!" "What
dialog: could it be...?" Etc., etc.
text: And then, immediately following this, on the viewer:
text: 86 THE LUMINESCENT CLOUD (AS SEEN ON A VIEWER) (O) 86
dialog: (as in earlier Epsilon 9 viewer -- but with no music,
text: only more AD LIBBED exclamations from an audience.)
text: The viewer goes blank.
scene_heading: 87 INT. RECREATION DECK (M) 87
dialog: We SEE that all this was being viewed by the CREW
text: MEMBERS (Aliens included) assembled on the Rec Deck.
dialog: The Recreation Deck is one of the largest areas on
dialog: the ship, several deck levels high, a part of one
text: wall consisting of picture windows, through which can
text: be seen sections of the drydock structure outside.
text: On another wall is a large viewer, on which was just
text: shown the Klingon transmission. Leading off and away
dialog: from this deck area are what are obviously other
dialog: specific recreation areas -- gymnasiums, food centers,
dialog: game rooms, lounges, etc.
text: 88 ANOTHER ANGLE OF THE RED DECK - HIGHER LEVEL 88
text: as the Crew Members chat in low, grim tones -- Kirk
text: (now with Captain's stripes) appears. As he comes
text: into view, the two hundred or so crew below go silent.
text: Kirk grimly indicates the now blank viewer:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: That's all we know about it;
dialog: except that it's now 2.2 days
dialog: from Earth. Enterprise is the
dialog: only Federation starship that
text: stands in its way.
text: 89 ANOTHER ANGLE - CREW REACTIONS 89
text: as the CAMERA FINDS various faces: human, alien; most
text: young, all intelligent, forthright -- anxious. Kirk
text: has paused a moment, now continues.
speaker_heading: KIRK (O.S.)
dialog: We assume there is a vessel of
dialog: some type at the heart of the
dialog: cloud. Our orders are to intercept,
dialog: investigate; and take whatever action
dialog: is necessary... and possible.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ...We can only hope that the
dialog: life form aboard that vessel
dialog: reasons as we do.
text: 90 ANGLE ON UHURA 90
text: standing near an intercom, which just then has emitted
text: a bosun's WHISTLE intercom signal.
speaker_heading: BRIDGE VOICE
dialog: (from intercom)
dialog: Bridge to Captain. Priority
dialog: signal from Epsilon Nine --
text: Kirk leans over to the intercom, speaks into it:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Put it on the viewer here...!
text: 91 ON THE REC DECK VIEWER (O) 91
text: as all eyes turn to the viewer which fades into a view
text: of Commander Branch, in the Epsilon 9 monitor room.
text: Branch is tense, reflecting extreme urgency. Near
text: Branch, working intently at the console are the Female
dialog: Lieutenant and a Technician.
speaker_heading: BRANCH
dialog: (from the viewer;
dialog: checking console
dialog: readings)
dialog: Enterprise... the Cloud is
dialog: definitely a powerfield of some
dialog: kind... Measures... My God!
text: Over 82 A.U.'s in diameter...
dialog: Must be something incredible
dialog: inside there generating it.
dialog: (looks up from
dialog: console)
dialog: We're transmitting linguacode
dialog: friendship messages on all
dialog: frequencies. No response.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: I have a null reading at the
dialog: center of the 'cloud,' sir.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: Definitely something inside..
dialog: there but all scans are being
text: reflected back.
dialog: (studies readings)
dialog: Receiving an odd pattern now..
dialog: (toward Branch)
text: They seem to be reacting to
dialog: our scans, sir.
speaker_heading: BRANCH
dialog: (inspecting another
dialog: console)
dialog: Some kind of energy surge...
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Enterprise... they could be
text: mistaking our scans as a
dialog: hostile act...
dialog: (reacts at readings)
dialog: Deflectors, emergency full!
text: Branch hits an alarm button; we HEAR ALARM KLAXON
text: SOUNDING. The viewer IMAGE DISTORTS, clears again
text: while Branch -- facing his viewer, continues urgently:
speaker_heading: BRANCH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We are under attack...!
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (to Uhura)
dialog: External view...!
scene_heading: 92 ON THE VIEWER - EXT. THE DESTRUCTION OF EPSILON 9 (O) 92
text: as the image of Branch is immediately replaced by an
text: external view of the plantoid, and the LUMINESCENT
text: CLOUD (at about the same distance from which the
dialog: Klingon cruisers were attacked).
text: Then it STRIKES the plantoid WITH FULL, CATACLYSMIC
text: FORCE. The viewer IMAGE BREAKS UP -- and immediately
text: the entire Starfleet base becomes a maelstrom of FLAR-
text: ING ENERGY, shattered structure, flying debris. And
text: then, all at once, there is nothing -- empty space,
text: Epsilon 9 is gone. We SEE only the stars; and the
text: mysterious LUMINESCENT CLOUD moving across the distant
dialog: sky.
dialog: (NOTE: The above is entirely SILENT, and when it is
dialog: finished, not a word is spoken.)
speaker_heading: KIRK (O.S.)
text: Viewer off.
text: 93 ANOTHER ANGLE - KIRK 93
text: as the viewer goes blank, all still facing the screen.
text: Then Kirk turns to the room as if to comment. Then he
text: stops -- nothing he can say will add at all to what
dialog: they've just seen. Instead:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Pre-launch countdown will
dialog: commence in forty minutes.
text: 94 ANOTHER ANGLE - CREW 94
text: The scene they have just witnessed still vivid in their
text: minds as they gaze somberly up toward Kirk who is exit-
text: ing. The bridge crew follows him out. Not a word is
text: said as the remainder of the crew waits another moment,
text: then begins to disperse toward their duty stations too.
scene_heading: 95 EXT. THE ENTERPRISE IN DRYDOCK (S) 95
text: Spectacular ORBIT VIEW of the giant starship in the
text: process of release. BEYOND US, in half light, EARTH
text: LOOMS HUGE. The dock welders are gone; the supply pods
text: float away from the ship. Little tongues of blue flame
text: spurt from the ship's maneuvering jets.
text: 96 CLOSER - ON ENTERPRISE (S) 96
text: as the large dock umbilical is released, floats free of
text: its starship attachment. Dock departure is imminent.
scene_heading: 97 INT. BRIDGE 97
text: Kirk in the center seat, intently studying the Naviga-

dialog: ... Lieutenant Junior Grade Ilia
text: (Eye-lee-ah) is already aboard,
dialog: and en route to the bridge.
text: 98 ANGLE ON DECKER - AT THE SCIENCE STATION 98
text: as Decker (now wearing Commander stripes) reacts,
text: almost startled, and Uhura continues:
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: She's a Deltan.
text: Uhura's tone and expression convey "Deltan" in a
dialog: certain, special manner.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (reprovingly)
dialog: And there are no finer navigators
dialog: in Starfleet, Commander.
text: The last is interrupted by:
text: 98A ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS 98A
text: as they snap open, and there emerges a breathtakingly
text: beautiful young woman (uniformed as a Navigator Lieu-
text: tenant) who strides purposefully onto the bridge. A
text: stunning figure, but hairless, entirely bald but or
text: delicate eyebrows and eyelashes. Her bald head is not
text: at all unattractive, in fact exudes an aura of sensual
text: nudity. Indeed, her whole being exudes sensuality.
dialog: (This is a racial characteristic, not a deliberate
text: presence.) She approaches Kirk
text: (NOTE: Throughout this sequence, Sulu eyes ILIA with
dialog: unrestrained admiration.)
speaker_heading: ILIA
dialog: Lieutenant Ilia reporting for
dialog: duty, sir.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (formally; rising)
dialog: Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
text: 99 ACROSS ILIA TO DECKER 99
text: as Ilia starts to speak, suddenly stops: she has just
text: then noticed Decker, who has stepped from his station
text: to face her. For an electronic moment their eyes meet,
dialog: hold in unquestioned recognition.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Hello, Ilia.
speaker_heading: ILIA
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Decker....!
text: Kirk has observed this with surprise and some concern
text: (it presages possible complications). Decker turns to
text: Kirk, slightly uncomfortable at this.
text: 
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: I was stationed on the Lieutenant's
dialog: home planet some years ago...
text: Ilia looks from Kirk back to Decker, puzzled at his
text: sleeve stripes.
speaker_heading: ILIA
dialog: (eyes his rank
dialog: stripes)
dialog: 'Commander' Decker?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Our Exec and Science Officer...
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (bitingly)
dialog: Captain Kirk has the utmost
dialog: confidence in me.
text: Kirk flashes a hard glance at Decker, then toward
dialog: Ilia too.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: And in you, too, Lieutenant.
speaker_heading: ILIA
dialog: My oath of celibacy is on record
dialog: Captain. May I assume my duties?
text: While respectful, her tone of voice has been just as
dialog: firm as Kirk's.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: By all means.
text: 100 ACROSS KIRK TO UHURA 100
text: receiving a message, now relaying it.
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: Captain, Starfleet reports our
dialog: last six crew members ready to
text: beam up...
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: ... but one of them is refusing
text: to step into the transporter.
text: Just as Kirk a moment before was tense, now suddenly
text: he's relaxed again; he rises.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Oh? I'll see that he beams up...!
text: And he hurries from the bridge, onto the elevator, is
text: gone. A moment of puzzled silence, then:
text: 
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Mr. Sulu, take Lieutenant Ilia
text: in hand.
speaker_heading: SULU
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Sir...?
dialog: (then understands)
dialog: Yes, of course...
dialog: (to Ilia)
dialog: Your pre-programming is already
dialog: set in, Lieutenant.
text: Sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair. He
text: starts offering Ilia his hand, then thinks better of
text: it, withdraws it abruptly, immediately busies himself
text: punching out equations on her console... AD LIBS,
dialog: "It's all on the computer. You'll have no problem..."
text: Sulu is nervous, fluttery around this lovely creature --
text: now hits a wrong switch. Produces a BEEPING SOUND which
text: he fumbles to shut off. She smiles; speaks quietly,
dialog: repeats:
speaker_heading: ILIA
dialog: I'm sworn to celibacy, Mister
dialog: Sulu. That makes me as safe
dialog: as any human female.
text: Sulu catches her eye but before he can reply, Decker has
dialog: moved in beside Ilia.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: I now the Captain meant no person-
dialog: al insult.
speaker_heading: ILIA
dialog: (eyes on console)
dialog: I would never take advantage of
dialog: a sexually immature species.
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: You can assure him that's true,
dialog: can't you?
dialog: Clearly, the remark carries special, personal
text: significance.
scene_heading: 101 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM 101
dialog: - -
dialog: 102 102
text: Kirk entering as Rand and her assistant electronically
dialog: list the last of the five arrivals who are leaving the

text: the last arrival, a young female Yeoman.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yeoman, what was the problem
dialog: down there?
speaker_heading: YEOMAN
dialog: (through intercom)
dialog: He insisted we go first, sir.
dialog: Said something about first seeing
dialog: how it scrambled our molecules.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Thank you, Yeoman
dialog: (hits transmit control)
dialog: Starfleet , this is Captain Kirk.
dialog: The officer is to be beamed up
dialog: immediately!
text: 103 ANGLE ON THE CHAMBER (O) 103
text: A moment, then again the GENERATING HUMMING, and then
text: the familiar BEAMING EFFECT. And then you SEE McCOY!
text: He fully MATERIALIZES. He looks himself over as if in
text: pleased surprise he is still in one piece. CAMERA PANS
text: McCoy from the Transporter Chamber to Kirk who is hav-
text: ing a hard time containing his amusement and delight.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Well, for a man who swore he'd
dialog: never return to Starfleet...
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (flat, tight)
dialog: What happened, Captain, sir, was
dialog: that your revered Admiral Nogura
dialog: invoked a little known -- and
dialog: seldom used -- reserve activation
dialog: clause...
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: ... in simpler language, Captain,
dialog: sir, they drafted me!
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (straight-faced)
dialog: They didn't...!
text: Kirk has offered his hand, but McCoy is already flaring:
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: This was your idea! It was
dialog: your idea, wasn't it!
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Bones, there's a 'thing' out
dialog: there --
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: -- Why is any object we don't
dialog: understand called a 'thing'?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continues)
dialog: -- headed this way. I need you...
text: 
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Were you behind this?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Bones, I need you badly.
text: Kirk extends his hand again; McCoy delays some moments
text: -- then finally responds. And once done, it is the long
text: hand clasp of two old friends reunited despite their
text: differences. Now McCoy turns to Rand.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Permission to come aboard, sir?
speaker_heading: RAND
dialog: (elated)
dialog: Permission granted, sir!
text: And McCoy moves toward the door, grumbling:
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: I hear Chapel's an MD now; I
dialog: need a top nurse, not a doctor
dialog: who'll argue every diagnosis...
dialog: And --
text: Even when he's in the corridor his grumbling trails
text: after him.
speaker_heading: McCOY

speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (cool, polite)
dialog: Sir, the Enterprise redesign
dialog: increases phaser power by

dialog: engines. When they went into
dialog: anti-matter imbalance, the
dialog: phasers were automatically cut
dialog: off.
text: Kirk is surprised by this information, perhaps slight-

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: DECKER

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: DECKER

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Sir, you haven't logged a single

dialog: That, plus your unfamiliarity

speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: The point, Captain, is that it's

dialog: (a beat, as Kirk reacts)
dialog: You pulled every string in the

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: McCOY

text: In the lounge, empty but for them, are Kirk and McCoy
text: -- obviously awaiting Spock, who ENTERS and presents
dialog: himself cold and aloof as before:
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Reporting as ordered, Captain.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Sit down, please.
text: Spock remains standing, addresses Kirk:
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy
dialog: absenting himself from this
dialog: interview.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I want him here.
dialog: (indicating)
dialog: Sit down!
text: 
text: For an instant, it looks like Spock will refuse. Then,
text: he complies but sits formally, rigidly. He ignores
dialog: McCoy totally.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You've reported that you felt
dialog: strong thought emotions. A
dialog: group of minds from a space
dialog: vessel? Could you make out any
dialog: plan, anything to do with
dialog: Earth?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (still formally)
dialog: Negative, Captain. I could sense
dialog: only what seemed an almost
dialog: omniscient pattern of perfect
dialog: logic. I can explain nothing
dialog: more; I understand nothing more.
text: Kirk is clearly disappointed -- and a bit uncomfortable
text: about what he must ask next. He exchanges a glance
dialog: with McCoy, then:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Also -- there was nothing in your
dialog: report about why you're here.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: That inquiry invades my personal
dialog: life, Captain.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Spock, we've already guessed why
dialog: you're here...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I inquired about you -- learned
dialog: you were studying with the
dialog: Masters...
text: Although Spock has been almost infuriatingly emotionless,
text: his expression shifts slightly. McCoy indicates this:
speaker_heading: McCOY
text: That flicker of emotion confirms
dialog: our guess. You failed.
text: 
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (facing McCoy for
dialog: the first time)
dialog: Your deductions do you credit,
dialog: Doctor... if your puerile
dialog: curiosity does not.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (not in amusement)
dialog: And now, anger, Spock?
text: Spock looks straight ahead -- his face instantly com-
text: posed to almost total blankness.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (beat; nods)
dialog: I still contain fragments of my
dialog: human half.
text: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: And whatever you sensed out here....
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: ... is my only hope of accomplishing
dialog: what the Masters could not.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: If you achieve perfect logic, Spock,
dialog: you'll pay a price. It's given
dialog: your planet ten thousand years of
dialog: peace, but no poetry's been written
dialog: since then, no music.
text: Spock has come to his feet fast - but Kirk is on his

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Let it drop, Bones.

dialog: You are my Science Officer -- I'll

speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I have accepted service here as

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: They may have attacked only as

dialog: (continuing; pleasant,
dialog: bland)
dialog: I am ready to commence my
dialog: observations.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (fast; to McCoy)
dialog: Doctor, a thorough examination
dialog: of this probe might provide some
dialog: insight into those who manufactured
dialog: it, and how to deal with them.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Let's get her to sickbay.
text: And he grasps "Ilia's" arm to escort her. But is as
text: though he has seized cast iron: immovable. McCoy is
text: thrown off balance merely by 'Ilia's" remaining sta-
text: tionary. She ignores McCoy, addresses Kirk:
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: I am programmed to observe and
dialog: record normal functioning
dialog: procedures of the carbon-based
dialog: units.
text: 256B Kirk glances at McCoy, who is totally bemused, but then 256B
text: Kirk quickly responds to "Ilia":
text: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: The examination is a normal
dialog: function.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You may proceede.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Thank you.
text: 257 CLOSE SHOT OF EXAMINING ROOM VIEWER (O) 257
text: scanning a "body". PULL BACK TO SHOW McCoy, Chapel,
text: Kirk, Spock and Chekov -- standing over "ILIA" who lies
text: prone on the table, the physicians moving the scanner
text: over her.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (from the start;
dialog: indicating)
dialog: ... micro-miniature hydraulics,
dialog: sensors, molecule-sized multi-
dialog: processor chips... and look at
dialog: this...
text: In the b.g., Decker enters, grimly observes the proceed-
dialog: ings.
speaker_heading: CHAPEL
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: An osmotic micro-pump... here
dialog: and here. Even the smallest
dialog: body functions are exactly
dialog: duplicated.
dialog: (traces with finger
dialog: on screen)
dialog: And every exocrine system is
dialog: here, too --
text: Chapel breaks off abruptly, noticing "Ilia" is peering
text: intently -- almost with a glimmer of recognition -- at
text: Decker. Slightly disconcerted, Chapel continues:
speaker_heading: CHAPEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: -- even eye moisture.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: (peering at Decker)
dialog: Deck -- er.
speaker_heading: 257A FAVORING SPOCK 257A
text: as everyone reacts to "Ilia's" utterance of Decker's
text: name. It seems to make the deepest impression on
text: Spock, confirming something he has suspected.
text: 
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (to "Ilia")
dialog: Interesting. Not 'Decker-unit'?
text: "Ilia" continues peering at Decker with just a hint
text: of a puzzled frown, a glimmer of distant recognition.
text: It's the first time we've seen her expression look
text: anything but cool and bland. This results in the
text: quizzical rising of one of Spock's eyebrows.
speaker_heading: 258 ANOTHER ANGLE 258
text: McCoy's examination now turns "Ilia" away from the
text: others. Spock quickly catches Kirk's and Decker's
text: attention, indicates an adjoining door -- they fol-
text: low him out of the room.
scene_heading: 259 INT. McCOY'S OFFICE 259
text: as Kirk, Spock and Decker enter, the door snapping
text: shut -- and Spock touching the electronic lock to
text: secure them. He faces the others:
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Captain... this probe may be a key
dialog: a key to the Aliens.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: It's a programmed mechanism,
dialog: Mr. Spock...
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: We have just seen that its body
dialog: duplicates our navigator in
dialog: precise detail. Suppose that
dialog: beneath its programming, the
dialog: real Ilia's memory patterns are
dialog: duplicated with equal precision.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: They had a pattern to follow...
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (nods)
dialog: ... they may have followed it
dialog: too precisely.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (comprehending)
dialog: Ilia's memory, her feelings of
dialog: loyalty, friendship, obedience...
dialog: might all be there.
text: 259A ANGLE ON DECKER 259A
text: also comprehending, and not liking it one bit as Spock
text: and Kirk are both turning their attention to him.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Exactly.
dialog: (to Decker)
dialog: And you did have a 'relationship'
dialog: with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: That probe in there -- in a
dialog: different form now -- is the
dialog: same thing that killed Ilia!
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Commander, we're locked in an
dialog: alien vessel, six hours from
dialog: Earth orbit, our only contact
dialog: with our captors is the probe.
dialog: If we can control it, persuade
dialog: it, use it in some way...
text: Interrupted by the SOUND of someone trying to open the
text: locked door behind them. Then a METAL RIPPING SOUND
text: as they whirl to see:
text: 260 MEDICAL OFFICE DOOR 260
text: with the METAL BUCKLING, TEARING -- and a single
text: hand slicing the steel door like paper. It is the
text: "Ilia" probe, her face absolutely impassive, her
text: whole manner incongruously benign. (Behind her, a
dialog: startled McCoy, Chapel and Chekov.) "Ilia" speaks
text: flatly, blandly.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: I have recorded enough here.
dialog: (motions to Kirk)
dialog: You will now assist me further.
text: Kirk exchanges a quick glance with Spock. Then:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (indicating Decker)
dialog: The Decker-unit can assist you
dialog: with much greater efficiency...
text: 
text: "Ilia" has seemed about to object -- but now her eyes
text: hold on Decker. Then she nods.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Carry on with your assignment,
dialog: Mr. Decker.
text: 260A ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS DECKER TO THE SMASHED DOOR 260A
dialog: (AND "ILIA")
text: as Decker looks at "Ilia" who stands at the torn door.
dialog: You can read Decker's mind: I'm supposed to persuade
text: that?! He turns back, finds Kirk's eyes on him.
text: Decker nods.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Aye, sir.
text: "Ilia" and a reluctant Decker EXIT.
speaker_heading: 260B EMPHASIZING SPOCK 260B
text: looking very troubled as they watch Decker and "Ilia"
text: leave. Kirk notices.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Spock? Concerned about his
dialog: chances?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I am uneasy with that being
dialog: our only hope of more information.
text: Spock EXITS.
scene_heading: 261 INT. V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE 261
text: floating in the vast, eerie, alien chamber -- sporadic
text: FLASHES OF ENERGY, erupting now and then. Various
text: other EFFECTS. OVER this, Kirk's VOICE:
speaker_heading: KIRK (V.O.)
text: Captain's Log. Stardate 7414.1.
dialog: Our best estimates place us some
dialog: four hours from Earth. No
dialog: significant Ilia memory patterns
dialog: within the alien probe. This
dialog: remains our only means of contact
dialog: with our captor.
scene_heading: 262 INT. ENTERPRISE AIRLOCK AREA 262
text: The area dimly lit -- unoccupied but for a lone AIRLOCK
text: TECHNICIAN checking and adjusting instruments. The
text: CAMERA MOVES PAST him to FIND:
dialog: 263 SPOCK 263
text: His face fixed with grim determination, walking quietly
text: with obvious intent not to attract the Tech's attention.
text: Now he steals up behind the TECH -- and in an instant
text: has applied a Vulcan nerve pinch. The Tech slumps over
text: his console.
scene_heading: 264 INT KIRK'S CABIN - VIEWER MONITOR 264
text: Showing a CLOSE SHOT of ENTERPRISE PICTURES, then PULL
text: BACK SLIGHTLY for an IMAGE of Decker and "Ilia" walk-
text: ing through the Rec Deck. PULL BACK FURTHER TO SHOW
text: Kirk watching this -- and with him is McCoy. They
text: continue watching a troubled beat, as:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (of pictures)
dialog: All these vessels were called
dialog: "Enterprise".
text: "Ilia" is giving the pictures a very interested look
text: as we HEAR in Kirk's cabin:
speaker_heading: UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE
dialog: (controlled excitement)
dialog: Bridge to Captain...
speaker_heading: 265 OMITTED 265
scene_heading: 266 INT. BRIDGE - UHURA'S STATION (SCIENCE STATION IN 266
dialog: B.G.)
text: Uhura at her console, struggling to hear the signal.
speaker_heading: KIRK'S INTERCOM VOICE
dialog: Kirk here.
text: 
text: In the b.g., Spock's station a MAINTENANCE TEAM
text: is replacing the broken Science Station computer.
dialog: (Spock is conspicuously absent.)
speaker_heading: UHURA
text: A faint signal from Starfleet,
dialog: sir. They have the intruder on
text: their monitors...
dialog: (struggling to
dialog: hear)
dialog: They show us... three hours...
dialog: twenty-four minutes from Earth!
speaker_heading: KIRK'S VOICE
dialog: (thru intercom)
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: 267 INT. RECREATION DECK 267
text: Decker and "Ilia", the Rec Deck unoccupied but for a
text: pair of wary SECURITY GUARDS at a very discreet dis-
text: tance. They are near the pictures of the five Enter-
dialog: prises, which should be FEATURED in this SHOT, as
text: Decker waves his hand about the huge room.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: The carbon units use this area
dialog: for recreation...
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: What type of recreation does the
dialog: crew aboard your vessel enjoy...?
dialog: 268 CLOSER TWO SHOT (PICTURES O.S.) 268
text: As "Ilia" moves on into the room, Decker follows:
text: 
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: The words 'recreation' and 'enjoy'
dialog: have no meaning to my programming.
text: Decker peers at the lovely android with frustration --
dialog: and no little pain, for she is after all the exact
text: replica of Ilia. She pays not the slightest attention
text: to Decker's reaction, and begins walking about the Rec
dialog: Deck taking in (and, clearly, transmitting all images
text: to V'ger) the sights. They are near a game area (elec-
dialog: tronic games), and now Decker points to one game,
text: switches it on -- presses button to activate its
text: LIGHTS and SOUNDS. "Ilia" watches interestedly as
dialog: Decker operates the game.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Ilia 'enjoyed' this game... she
dialog: nearly always won --
text: And he demonstrates again, as "Ilia" steps to the
text: device, deftly hits some buttons -- and for just an
text: instant she turns to Decker with a momentary glimmer
text: of recognition.
scene_heading: 269 INT. KIRK'S CABIN - GROUP WATCHING THE MONITOR 269
text: McCoy watching with special interest:
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (approving)
dialog: Good! He's using audial-visual
dialog: association.
dialog: But the words are not out of McCoy's mouth when "Ilia"
dialog: says:
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: This device serves no purpose.
text: She steps away from the game; Decker's disappointment
text: is evident. So is everyone elses.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Damn...!
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (nods grimly)
dialog: She needs something else:
dialog: something much more personal to
dialog: stimulate memory patterns. Something
dialog: with a more emotional tie.
text: Kirk reacts to this, reflective.
scene_heading: 270 INT. REC DECK FULL ON DECKER AND "ILIA" 270
text: Decker waving back toward the general area of the
text: Enterprise pictures.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: The crews of the previous
dialog: Enterprises were also carbon units.
dialog: In what way is the life form in
dialog: your vessel different?
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: Carbon units are not true life
dialog: forms... Do those images repre-
dialog: sent how Enterprise has evolved
dialog: into its present form?
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (hoping he's struck
dialog: a responsive chord)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: Carbon units have clearly retarded
dialog: Enterprise's proper evolvement.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (controlling surprise)
dialog: What is Enterprise's proper
dialog: evolvement?
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: Enterprise should not require
dialog: the presence of carbon units.
text: And with this she moves off, observing other Rec Deck
text: objects. Decker moves with her; then:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Enterprise would be unable to
dialog: function without carbon units.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: More data concerning this functioning
dialog: is necessary before carbon units can
dialog: be patterned for data storage.
text: 271 ACROSS "ILIA" TO DECKER 271
text: as he reacts to this ominous note; he stops abruptly.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: (stopping; almost
dialog: pleasantly)
dialog: When my examination is complete,
dialog: the carbon units will be reduced
dialog: to data patterns.
dialog: This has been delivered with chilling blandness, and
text: she stands facing Decker, almost as though waiting for
text: him to thank her. He thinks fast now.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Within you are memory patterns of
dialog: a carbon unit. If I can help you
dialog: revive these patterns; you could
dialog: understand our functions better.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: That is logical. You may procede.
dialog: 272 ON DECKER 272
dialog: realizing the difficult task ahead; the pain he will
dialog: suffer.
scene_heading: 273 INT. V'GER - ANGLE UP TOWARD ENTERPRISE (M) 273
text: The ship stationary in the chamber as now we SEE an
text: exterior hatch sliding fully open. Up through the
text: hatch a circular airlock door opens -- and a tiny
text: figure in a thruster spacesuit emerges, steps into
text: space, slowly floats down through the hatch and under
dialog: the Enterprise saucer section. In this and subsequent
text: VIEWS we will SEE that on the rear pack of his thruster
text: spacesuit is a FLASHING STROBE LIGHT which regularly
text: EMITS the identifying SIGNAL of this particular suit.
dialog: (By which Kirk will be able to see Spock's position
dialog: even from several miles away.)
text: 274 CLOSER ON THE SPACESUITED FIGURE (M) 274
text: MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA until the features behind
text: the face mask are clearly identifiable: Spock, his
text: face set in the same grim, determined expression, as
text: he touches his spacesuit transmitter control.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Computer, commence recording.
dialog: Captain Kirk -- this message
dialog: will detail my attempt to
dialog: contact the aliens...
scene_heading: 275 INT. BRIDGE 275
text: Kirk ENTERING, crossing Uhura as she calls:
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: Starfleet signals, sir, growing
dialog: in strength...
dialog: (listening intently)
dialog: They -- have Intruder on their
text: monitors -- it's decelerating --
dialog: powerfield cloud beginning to
dialog: dissipate...
speaker_heading: SULU
dialog: Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons
dialog: indicate Intruder on a course
dialog: into Earth orbit...
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Sir! Airlock four has been opened;
dialog: a thruster suit is reported missing!
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (reacts knowingly)
dialog: Spock...!
dialog: (to navigator)
dialog: Get a fix on his position!
scene_heading: 276 INT. V'GER - MED. ON SPOCK 276
text: His features now set into an almost trance-like expres-
text: sion as he concentrates on the thought emanations.
text: Then we SEE his head turn, he peers off -- then he
text: moves his thruster controls. We SEE the small blue
text: jets of his thrusters -- his spacesuit figure begins
text: to move off in the direction he was concentrating
dialog: upon.
scene_heading: 277 ANOTHER ANGLE - SPOCK 277
text: His thrusters moving him across V'ger's vast chamber
text: then dropping down into a deep "trough"-like area
text: which stretches into the distance ahead of him. A
text: cloud of CRYSTAL FORMS (Kirk's entrapment) become
text: visible to one side but Spock passes them at some dis-
dialog: tance and does not attract them.
text: We can SEE more clearly now the point on the inner wall
text: of the trough toward which Spock is heading. It is an
text: unusual combination of GLOWING FORCEFIELDS which seem
text: to mark this point of the vessel as of some importance.
dialog: (Here, also, we will become aware of "sensor-bee"
text: swarms, intermittently darting toward this same wall
dialog: from all points of the chamber.)
scene_heading: 278 INT. AIRLOCK AREA 278
text: SHOWING Kirk in a thruster spacesuit, helmet being
text: readied by AIRLOCK TECHNICIANS. McCoy is also here,
dialog: arguing with Kirk:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (from the start)
dialog: ... I don't want him stopped, Bones;
dialog: I want him to lead me to whatever's
dialog: out there...!
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: And if that 'whatever' has taken
dialog: over his mind....?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Then he'll have still led me to
dialog: it, won't he?
text: And Kirk steps into the airlock door, hits a control --
text: it begins sliding closed behind him.
scene_heading: 279 INT. V'GER - ANGLE UP TOWARD ENTERPRISE 279
text: UP THROUGH the circular airlock door as it slides open
text: -- and Kirk's tiny spacesuited figure floats down
text: clear of the saucer.
text: 280 CLOSER ON KIRK 280
text: SEEING his face through the spacesuit faceplate as he
text: scans the darkness.
speaker_heading: SULU'S VOICE
dialog: Bridge, Captain. We make Spock
dialog: as 26 Mark 345 degrees off ship's
text: axis.
text: During which, Kirk spots something.
text: 281 KIRK'S POV 281
text: Spock's STROBE blinker at a mile or so distance,
text: nearing V'ger's inner walls.
dialog: 282 ANGLE ON KIRK 282
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I have him in sight.
text: During which, Kirk touches his thruster controls and
text: blue thruster jet propels him off in the direction
text: indicated. His thrusters come on for a longer period
text: of time as he accelerates to the higher speed necessary
dialog: to overtake Spock...
scene_heading: 283 INT. ILIA'S QUARTERS 283
text: The DOOR SNAPPING open, and "Ilia", McCoy and Decker
text: entering. Then CAMERA REVEALS Chapel already inside,
text: looking through some female adornments she's found
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: CHAPEL
dialog: I remember Lt. Ilia once mentioning
dialog: that she wore this...
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (reacting; tight)
dialog: ... when we met.
text: Clearly this is very painful to Decker. Meanwhile,
text: Chapel hands the Deltan headband to "Ilia".
text: 
speaker_heading: CHAPEL
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Put it on.
text: "Ilia" hasn't the slightest idea what to do with the
text: headband, holds it, runs her fingers over the jewels
text: and feathers embedded into it. Chapel takes it from
text: her, places it on 'Ilia's" head, now switches on the
text: light illuminating the dressing table mirror -- stands
text: behind her with Decker, both watching apprehensively.
text: 284 ANGLE ON "ILIA" 284
text: studying her image in the mirror, her face totally
text: blank a moment, but then breaking into a bemused
text: frown -- as though trying to remember. And:
speaker_heading: CHAPEL
dialog: (helpfully)
dialog: Ilia...
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (quiet; urging)
dialog: On Delta... remember...?
text: And it seems that "Ilia" does remember. She peers at
text: her image, then sets the headband into its exact
text: proper position. Then she turns and looks at them
text: with recognition.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: (haltingly)
dialog: Dr. Chapel...
text: 285 ACROSS CHAPEL TO DECKER 285
text: as Chapel smiles, pleased, and looks at Decker who
text: stares at "Ilia" nonplussed. This is Ilia coming
dialog: alive!
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: (to Decker)
dialog: "Will..."
text: And she touches his hand, runs her own hand over it,
text: and smiles.
text: Decker is completely overwhelmed, struggles for words
text: and looks to McCoy for some kind of help. McCoy
text: realizes Decker is losing himself in fantasy.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (gently reminding)
dialog: Commander... this is a mechanism...
text: Decker is startled, and for another slit-second he's
text: lost -- but then he realizes the reality, and what he
dialog: should do:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (gently; but urgingly)
dialog: Ilia, help us make direct contact
dialog: with V'ger...
speaker_heading: "ILIA
dialog: I... cannot.
text: Decker looks at "Ilia's" hand still resting on his.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Then tell us who V'ger is; where
dialog: he's from... W need your help.
text: For another moment "Ilia" continues smiling at Decker,
text: holding his hand. Then, abruptly, the smile vanishes
text: -- the hand is released. Clearly, she's again the
dialog: probe, as:
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: Why have two carbon units entered
dialog: V'ger...?
text: Decker glances at McCoy, who shakes his head almost
text: imperceptibly: he doesn't know. But Decker has an
dialog: obvious reply:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: They want to make contact with
dialog: V'ger...
dialog: (trying to revive
dialog: "Ilia's" memory again;
dialog: touches her hand)
dialog: Ilia...
text: "Ilia" peers at him blankly, allows him to continue
text: touching her hand, but obviously it means nothing to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (continuing;
dialog: distressed,
dialog: to "Ilia")
dialog: Does V'ger object to the presence
dialog: of the two carbon units?
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: The carbon units are of no
dialog: consequence; V'ger will determine
dialog: their purpose.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Their purpose is to survive.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: That is also V'ger's purpose.
text: Decker's face reflects his bemusement:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: You said V'ger's purpose was to
dialog: find and join with the Creator.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: That is how V'ger will survive.
dialog: 286 ON DECKER 286
text: as now, the bemusement changes to just the slightest
dialog: enlightenment.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: I wish to continue my observations.
scene_heading: 287 INT. V'GER - KIRK MANEUVERING WITHIN THE CHAMBER 287
text: 
text: Kirk but a small object, thruster jets occasionally
text: spurting as he guides himself deeper into the trench
text: as he continues forward progress in the direction he
dialog: saw Spock taking.
text: 288 CLOSER ON KIRK 288
text: So we can SEE his face (through the plate), as he looks
text: ahead into the distance toward Spock.
speaker_heading: 289 KIRK'S POV (O) 289
text: Spock's STROBE signal closer and Spock's tiny space-
text: suited figure now becoming dimly visible as he moves
text: steadily toward the GLOWING FORCEFIELDS of the inner
text: wall.
dialog: 290 ON KIRK 290
text: His attention fixed on Spock, he never notices until
text: an instant too late an O.S. object; quickly he hits a
text: thruster control, and we SEE the MANEUVERING JET turn
text: him to the side as:
text: 291 WIDER ANGLE - KIRK AND THE BLOB FORMATION (O) 291
text: A swarm of strange-looking translucent crystal-like
text: FORMS on a collision course with Kirk. (NOTE: They
dialog: were traveling randomly, and are not deliberate ob-
text: structions. However, Kirk's nearness now has attracted
text: them and the swarm of them heads in his direction.
text: Kirk tries to avoid them; he hits a second MANEUVERING
text: JET -- but he overcompensates, and spins straight into
text: the intercepting swarm of them.
scene_heading: 292 MED. SHOT - KIRK (O) 292
text: as the nearest crystal forms WHIP INTO SHOT, adhering
text: to Kirk's spacesuit. He hits full MANEUVERING JETS
text: now, seems to make some escape, but still more forms
text: WHIP IN, adhere.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Bridge...!
scene_heading: 293 INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING HELM 293
text: All eyes anxiously on the O.S. main viewer.
speaker_heading: KIRK'S VOICE
dialog: ... stand by, I may be in trouble...
text: Sulu hits the viewer magnification control.
text: 294 ANGLE TO MAIN VIEWER (M) 294
text: As the distant STROBE FLASHES of Kirk's spacesuit are
text: MAGNIFIED CLOSER, pulling Kirk into MEDIUM LONG SHOT.
text: We can SEE the details of the swarm of forms adhering.
text: But we can SEE that Kirk's spacesuit is now about half
dialog: covered with them!
speaker_heading: 294A REVERSE ANGLE 294A
text: 
text: Expressions of bridge crew to reflect the horror of
dialog: what they're seeing as:
speaker_heading: SULU
dialog: Your phaser, Captain...!
dialog: Use your phaser...!
speaker_heading: KIRK'S VOICE
dialog: (transmitter, weak)
dialog: Can't... reach... phas --

speaker_heading: SULU
dialog: Mr. Spock, the Captain is in

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mr. Spock!
text: Looks of distress are exchanged.
scene_heading: 295 INT. V'GER - SPOCK 295
text: Spock's spacesuited figure MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA,
dialog: as we HEAR:
speaker_heading: KIRK'S VOICE
dialog: (weak; STATIC)
dialog: ... Spock...! ... need help...!
dialog: ... trapped...!
text: No indication at first that Spock has heard; his face
text: set with determination, his eyes fixed on his destin-

speaker_heading: KIRK'S VOICE
dialog: (continuing; weakening;
dialog: STATIC)
dialog: ... pressure on me...! ... can't
dialog: move...! Spock...!
text: 
text: 296 ON SPOCK - CLOSE 296
text: as Kirk's VOICE STOPS -- and all that is heard now
text: is the HEAVY STATIC crackling ominously. Spock's
text: expression flickers, then he hits reverse thruster
text: JETS, stops -- he turns to glance at the inner wall,
text: then his thrusters turn him so he can look back the
text: way he came from. But he cannot resist Kirk's call;
text: he suddenly hits his thruster controls, then JETS
dialog: FLARE, and:
scene_heading: 297 WIDER ANGLE - SPOCK 297
text: as thruster JETS accelerate him back toward Kirk.
scene_heading: 298 INT. BRIDGE - VIEWER (M) 298

scene_heading: 299 INT. V'GER - KIRK AND SPOCK 299
text: with Spock in the near distance, heading TOWARD the

dialog: adjustment.
text: 300 ANGLE ON SPOCK AND KIRK'S ENCASED SPACESUIT (O) (S) 300
text: Spock levels the phaser carefully. FIRES. The PHASER
text: BEAM strikes the blob form -- it SHATTERS, the pieces
text: DISINTEGRATING.
scene_heading: 301 INT. V'GER - SPOCK AND KIRK 301
text: facing each other while hovering in space.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Bridge, cancel rescue teams.
dialog: (hard)
dialog: Spock, what in the hell are you
dialog: doing out here!
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I am seeking answers, Captain.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (with insight)
dialog: Answers to what, Spock? Our
dialog: dilemma -- or your personal one?
text: Spock does not immediately reply, peers at Kirk through
text: the faceplate a long beat, then abruptly looks away,
text: points off into the distance:
scene_heading: 302 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING INNER WALL (O) 302
text: We can SEE what appear to be SPARKLING GLOBULES OF
text: LIGHT darting toward the inner wall in the distance,
dialog: then disappearing there. (We'll SEE other swarms
dialog: occasionally too, coming from different directions --
text: they will later be identified as "sensor swarms" on
dialog: closer examination.)
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Captain, I believe there we will
text: find an indication of whoever --
dialog: or whatever -- is aboard this
dialog: vessel...
text: Kirk weighs alternatives, then pushes his thruster
text: controls and begins moving in the direction Spock
text: indicated.
text: Their thruster jets flash, propel them toward the
text: point on the inner wall.
scene_heading: 303 INT. V'GER - AT INNER WALL 303
text: The most prominent area of the vast inner wall -- the
text: patterns on the wall here seem to GLOW with life.
text: The spacesuited figures of Kirk and Spock ENTER SCENE,
text: gliding slowly toward what seems to be the central
dialog: part of theses patterns.
text: 304 CLOSER ON KIRK AND SPOCK 304
text: as they approach and then we SEE the brief REVERSE
text: THRUSTERS and then forward momentum stops; motionless.
text: Then Spock sees something, indicates.
text: 305 LONG ANGLE TO INCLUDE SENSOR SWARM (O) 305
text: Now, we SEE that they are tiny, multi-colored points
text: of FLASHING LIGHT -- almost like swarms of bees.
text: They approach the inner wall at this central point
text: and seem to "disappear" through the orifice.
text: 306 KIRK AND SPOCK - ANOTHER "SWARM" APPROACHING (O) 306
text: This "sensor swarm" has been coming from a direction
dialog: that will take them close past Kirk and Spock. Then,
text: as it passes, Spock reaches out quickly, grabs.
text: He turns to Kirk, his hand closed on something.
text: 307 CLOSE ON KIRK AND SPOCK (AGAINST "TUBE" WALL) 307
text: Spock opens his hand, retaining a hold on something
text: with his fingers. He brings it up to Kirk's face mask
text: -- it's a tiny SENSOR, its multi-colors flashing as it
text: tries to escape from Spock's fingers. And in this CLOSE
text: VIEW, we SEE that this is a SENSOR very much like the
text: one we've seen earlier embedded in the Ilia-probe's
text: throat hollow. Then Spock releases it and it darts
text: to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner
text: wall.
dialog: 308 KIRK AND SPOCK'S POV (O) 308
text: From this closer distance, we SEE that an opening ap-
text: pears in the wall, admits the sensor swarm, then closes
dialog: immediately.
dialog: 309 BACK TO SHOT 309
text: Kirk and Spock exchange a look. Their thruster JETS
text: ignite briefly, moving them in that direction.
scene_heading: 310 INT. V'GER - KIRK AND SPOCK (O) 310
text: closely approaching the inner wall now, timing their
dialog: movements to coincide with the arrival of another
text: "swarm" -- the wall begins OPENING. The "swarm"
text: through, the wall begins CLOSING -- but Spock and
text: Kirk slip in before it closes.
scene_heading: 311 INT. "MEMORY CAVE" - SPOCK AND KIRK 311
text: The wall closing behind them, they are safely inside.
text: But as they stop their forward momentum, their eyes
text: widen with awe and surprise at what they are seeing:
speaker_heading: 311A WHAT THEY SEE (M) 311A
text: The long "cave" chamber with its row of huge MEDIATOR
text: BALLS extending into the distance. To one side, the
text: gleaming CRYSTAL MEMORY WALL.
dialog: 311B KIRK AND SPOCK 311B
text: as Spock makes a quick analysis and estimate of what
text: they are seeing. Then, he takes out his tricorder
text: again, propels himself toward the memory crystals.
text: Kirk follows.
text: 311C AT MEMORY CRYSTAL 311C
text: as Spock adjusts his tricorder through several readings.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: It would appear that the atomic
dialog: arrays of these crystals store
dialog: information. A remarkably
dialog: efficient system.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (indicates)
dialog: And these 'sensor-swarms' collect
dialog: that data, carry it here.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (nods; indicates)
dialog: New crystals: they must contain
dialog: the most recent data obtained --
dialog: And Spock touches one of these new crystals (it will be
text: shinier, more pulsating than the others): ANOTHER
speaker_heading: RAPID
text: PROFUSION OF FAINT IMAGES, but this time including a
text: pattern-like image of Klingons, Klingon vessels (the
dialog: ones destroyed by the Cloud), and obvious Starfleet
text: personnel -- and the Epsilon 9 station. Also, a
text: pattern
dialog: of the Security Guard killed by the probe. And Ilia.
text: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station
dialog: ... and Ilia!! They seem to be
dialog: more than just images...
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (agreeing)
text: Exact patterns. The energy bolt
dialog: that hit them wasn't simply a
dialog: weapon -- it dematerialized them,
dialog: stored them. But why?
text: And he turns and begins moving on, studying the wall,
dialog: consulting his tricorder.
text: 312 ACROSS THEM TO ANOTHER SECTION OF THE WALL 312
text: Spock inspecting this area at which the "newer" crystals
text: are PULSATING and GLOWING, and which appears to be a
dialog: termination of the Crystal area, continuing on and dis-
text: appearing through the wall.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: If this is their ship's data
dialog: banks, where is the crew? Or
dialog: is their entire ship automated?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Captain, I do not believe there
dialog: is a crew -- or that this is a
dialog: vessel as such.
text: A beat, as Kirk reacts incredulously.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I am almost certain now that all
dialog: of this is V'ger -- I believe
dialog: that we are inside a life form,
dialog: a living machine.
text: Spock turns his spacesuit, turns his tricorder out to-
text: ward the Mediator Balls, takes a reading in that di-
text: rection. Then a glance to Kirk.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I must attempt mindmeld with it,
dialog: Captain.
text: Spock touches his spacesuit controls; the THRUSTER
text: JETS move him out toward the Mediator Balls.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (warningly)
dialog: Spock...
text: 313 ANGLE AT MEDIATOR BALL 313
text: Spock reaching the Ball, halts his momentum and removes
text: one gauntlet, baring his hand. Stretching the bare
text: hand toward a part of it which looks strangely "alive."
dialog: The very power generated from this area is clearly
text: affecting Spock's hand. Meanwhile, Kirk has used his
text: THRUSTERS to join him.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Spock, if you're right, its mind
dialog: may be enormous...
text: But Spock pays him no attention, his entire being now
text: focused on the PULSATING GLOW of the "alive" area --
text: the CAMERA MOVING IN CLOSER TO Spock, as he forces his
text: hand toward that surface, closer, closer.
dialog: 314 KIRK 314
text: watching, almost mesmerized. Torn between wanting to
text: pull Spock away from the wall -- and knowing that
dialog: Spock must go through with it. For everyone's sake.
text: 315 CLOSER ON SPOCK 315
text: preparing for the ordeal, moving his hand to the "liv-
text: ing area," the invisible force even stronger -- but
text: Spock's strength unwavering, and now he touches the
text: surface -- and it FLARES WITH STRANGE ENERGY at the
text: touch. And at the same moment Spock' body convulses
dialog: as if tens of thousands of volts of electricity are
text: charging through him.
text: 316 CLOSE ON SPOCK'S FACE 316
text: as he begins to shudder with the shock, the CAMERA
text: CONTINUES INTO EXTREME CLOSE-UP as we SEE Spock's mouth
text: open -- he SCREAMS. CAMERA INTO EXTREME CLOSE SHOT OF
text: SPOCK'S EYES.
scene_heading: 317 CAMERA ZOOM - THROUGH SPOCK'S EYES 317
text: MUSIC IN AND UP as we travel through ABSTRACT IMAGES
dialog: (per Con Pederson discussion). Symbolizing V'ger's
dialog: incredible and complex store of mechanistic knowledge,
text: these IMAGES suggest patterns of atoms, molecules,
dialog: galaxies, dimensions of the universe beyond human
dialog: knowledge or comprehension. It takes only fifteen or
text: twenty seconds, but seems to span aeons, taking us
dialog: through micro-infinity and macro-infinity.
text: DISSOLVE TO :
scene_heading: 318 INT. DISPENSARY - SPOCK'S EYES 318
text: CAMERA BRIDGING BACK OUT THROUGH SPOCK'S EYES AND INTO
text: ANGLE ON SPOCK'S FACE as he lies in a sickbay bed. His
text: eyes are open; he is staring straight ahead as if in a
text: catatonic state, completly unaware of his surroundings.
text: Then Doctor Chapel leans INTO SCENE, moving a medical
text: scanner over the brain area.
speaker_heading: CHAPEL
dialog: Now scanning pons area at spinal
dialog: nerve fiber connection...
text: 319 ANGLE ON McCOY AND KIRK 319
text: McCoy at a console, watching readings he is getting
text: from Chapel's scanner. Kirk watches McCoy anxiously.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Indications of some neurological
text: trauma--the power pouring through
dialog: that mind-meld must have been
dialog: staggering...
text: Before Kirk can reply, they HEAR a LAUGH! An abrupt,
text: harsh, bitter laugh.
text: 320 ACROSS THEM TO SICKBAY 320
text: as all whirl to the patient area where it is obviously
text: Spock who has just laughed -- but there is no indication
text: of laughter from him now. A startled Chapel has stepped
text: back away from the bed. Spock seems to be attempting
text: to focus, orient himself as Kirk and McCoy hurry to the
dialog: bedside.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Jim...
text: And Spock reaches out a hand weakly., takes a surprised
text: Kirk's hand in his. McCoy exchanges a surprised glance
text: with Kirk, as Spock -- clutching Kirk's hand in friend-
text: ship and need -- struggles to summon strength to speak.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This simple feeling...
dialog: (looks at Kirk)
dialog: ... is so far beyond V'ger's
dialog: comprehension.
speaker_heading: 321 ANOTHER ANGLE 321
text: with Kirk and McCoy exchanging another surprised
text: glance (at Spock's emotion), with McCoy gesturing Kirk
dialog: not to question it.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Were you right? Spock? V'ger
dialog: is a living machine...?
text: 
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: A life form of its own; a
dialog: conscious, living entity.
speaker_heading: CHAPEL
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: A living machine...?!
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (to Chapel)
dialog: We're living machines, too: protein
dialog: mechanisms.
text: Kirk nods at McCoy.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: And it considers the Enterprise a
dialog: living machine: that's why the
dialog: probe refers to our ship as an
dialog: entity.
speaker_heading: CHAPEL
dialog: If it thinks our ship is alive
dialog: what does it think we are?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: An 'infestation' -- bacteria...
dialog: microbes.
speaker_heading: 322 ANOTHER ANGLE 322
text: as Spock turns to Kirk.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I saw V'ger's planet: a planet
text: populated by living machines.
dialog: Unbelievable technology.
dialog: (pained)
dialog: V'ger has knowledge that spans this
dialog: universe.
dialog: And... in all this order... all
dialog: this magnificence, V'ger feels
dialog: no awe...no delight... no beauty...
dialog: (a beat; exhausted)
dialog: I should have known...
text: Kirk waits for Spock to continue, but Spock seems too
dialog: weak.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Know what, Spock? What?
text: But Spock falls back, exhausted -- and McCoy gently
text: tugs at Kirk, AD-LIBBING, "Let him rest, Jim..."
text: Kirk shrugs McCoy away, addresses Spock:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What should you have known?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (weak)
dialog: No meaning... No hope...
dialog: (summoning strength)
dialog: And, Jim, no answers...!
dialog: Jim, it's looking for answers
dialog: itself!
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What answers?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: 'Is this all I am? Is there not
dialog: more?'
text: Just then an INTERCOM SIGNAL:
speaker_heading: UHURA'S VOICE
text: A faint signal from Starfleet,
dialog: sir! Intruder Cloud has been
dialog: located on their outer monitors
dialog: for past twenty-seven minutes...
text: dissipating rapidly as it approaches.
text: Immediately, Sulu's voice:
speaker_heading: SULU'S VOICE
text: Starfleet reports forward velocity
dialog: has slowed to sub-warp speed! We
dialog: are three minutes from Earth's
dialog: orbit!-
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (into intercom)
dialog: I'll be right there...
dialog: (to Chapel; crisp)
dialog: I need Spock on the bridge.
dialog: 323 ANOTHER ANGLE 323
text: as Chapel urns to a MED TECH, AD LIBS an order,
text: "Dalaphaline, twenty cc's..." As the Tech quickly sets
text: the hypo-injector, and hands it to Chapel - and she
text: injects Spock, the hypo emitting a fast, QUIET HISS --
text: Kirk gazes at Spock just an instant as Spock breathes
text: deeply, the drug clearly strengthening him. Chapel
text: and the Tech help Spock from the bed, as Kirk addresses
dialog: McCoy:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: A machine planet...? Sending a
dialog: machine to Earth looking for its
dialog: Creator...?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: God.
text: Kirk looks at him, then at Spock -- on his feet now --
dialog: then at McCoy again:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: 'To find the Creator,' the probe
dialog: said. Find God...?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Isn't that what we're all trying
dialog: to do...?
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: All us machines...?
text: Kirk stands facing him another moment, then whirls
text: and steps to the monitor, flips some buttons, and
text: peaks into his communicator.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Mr. Chekov, Commander Decker's
dialog: present location?
speaker_heading: CHEKOV'S VOICE
dialog: He... they... are in Engineering,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (into intercom)
dialog: I want to make a ship's announcement.
dialog: But it's to be heard only in
dialog: Engineering.
speaker_heading: UHURA'S VOICE
dialog: Ready, Captain.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (voice amplified)
dialog: This is the Captain speaking. It
text: appears that the alien ship...
text: V'ger... is NOT a manned vessel...
dialog: 324 ENGINEERING 324
text: SHOWING Scott (at his console) listening to Kirk's
text: words -- and facing Decker and "Ilia" who are just
dialog: about to leave Engineering. (In b.g. the Engine core
text: GLOWS the appropriate color, and there is a SOFT
text: HUM of IDLE POWER.) Kirk's VOICE continues:
speaker_heading: KIRK'S VOICE
dialog: (amplified)
dialog: It is a living entity...! A machine
dialog: life form. We are attempting to
dialog: ascertain its intentions. All
dialog: personnel will maintain yellow alert
dialog: status!
text: 325 CLOSER ON DECKER AND "ILIA" 325
text: 
text: The probe bland as usual, but Kirk's words seem to
dialog: have strangely elated Decker; he says to her:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: A machine...! Then it had to be
dialog: programmed. By whom...?
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: By the Creator.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (probing)
dialog: To join, and become One with the
dialog: Creator?
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: To learn all that is learnable;
dialog: to deliver all collected data to
dialog: the Creator on the third planet.
dialog: That is the programming.
dialog: 326 INCLUDE SCOTT 326
text: just now confronting them, regarding "Ilia" with open
text: disapproval.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Well, sir, now what about all that?
text: A living entity, the Captain says...
dialog: entity... A living thing...!
text: Decker really hasn't heard Scott; he's gazing at "Ilia,"
text: attempting to digest what she's just said. But quickly:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Thank you, Scotty...
text: He moves to leave.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (dourly)
dialog: Your welcome, sir.
text: Now Decker and "Ilia" move toward the exit, Scott gaz-
text: ing after them glaringly, watching "Ilia's" every
text: move. Suddenly, almost into the corridor, "Ilia" turns
text: and looks back at the engine room. She addresses
text: Decker, but load enough for Scott to overhear:
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: There is no logical reason for
dialog: carbon units to control Enterprise's
dialog: power systems.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (to "Ilia")
dialog: Lassie, if I were functioning
dialog: 'logically,' right now I'd be
dialog: showing you the inside of our
dialog: scrap metal compactor!
scene_heading: 327 INT. BRIDGE 327
text: Kirk with McCoy and Spock, who although somewhat shaky,
text: is clearly more alert. They are just assuming their
dialog: stations.
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: We're now locked into Starfleet's
dialog: transceivers; Admiral Nogura has
dialog: received your reports, sir.
text: 328 ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O) 328
text: Kirk pausing halfway to his chair to study the viewer
text: on which is appearing an IMAGE of V'ger looming omi-
text: nously in orbit over Earth.
speaker_heading: UHURA
text: The visual is a lunar monitor
dialog: relay, sir.
text: As they begin to study it, the IMAGE suddenly distorts and
text: is replaced by signal interference -- SIGNAL STATIC LINES
text: RUNNING ACROSS THE VIEWER SCREEN.
dialog: (Somewhat resembling the kind of high voltage interference
dialog: some-times seen on the television screen.)
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Heavy interference, sir -- it's
dialog: coming from here, inside the
dialog: intruder itself...
text: Uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we
text: HEAR A SERIES OF CARRIER WAVE BEEPS. Spock looks up from
text: his console, listens to it.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Puzzling! The interference
dialog: appears to be a rather simple
dialog: carrier wave code signal...
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: On an old style radio frequency,
dialog: sir...
text: 329 PAST KIRK TO THE ELEVATOR 329
text: as the doors snap open and Decker and "Ilia" appear.
dialog: All eyes go to them as:
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: (to Decker;
dialog: interrupting)
dialog: As I stated, V'ger calls to the
dialog: Creator.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (nods; turns to Kirk)
dialog: V'ger is announcing that it has
dialog: arrived, sir -- that it's ready
dialog: to deliver the information it
dialog: was programmed to collect...
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: 'To learn all that is learnable.'
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (to Kirk)
text: It expects a return signal now,
dialog: ordering it to transmit that
dialog: information to the Creator.
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: (whirling)
dialog: Sir! V'ger's signals have
dialog: stopped...
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: (as if frightened)
dialog: Decker... The Creator has not
dialog: responded.
text: Kirk hears this, turning inquiringly toward her, but
text: Uhura interrupts:
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: Picking up Starfleet again; a
dialog: lunar monitor relay...
speaker_heading: 330 ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O) 330
text: as, indeed, the interference is fading and a new Main
text: Viewer IMAGE is appearing -- it shows V'GER IN EARTH
text: ORBIT with a strange looking OBJECT moving away from
text: V'ger. It is an ominous looking, HUGE SWIRLING GREEN
text: MASS -- it resembles the same green plasma-energy bolts
dialog: that destroyed the Klingons and Epsilon 9 -- and very
text: nearly the Enterprise. It is not a bolt now -- the mass
text: is much larger and appears much more deadly. A second
text: object has now formed and moves off, a third one begins
text: to appear. (Meanwhile, the first and second PLASMA-
text: ENERGY OBJECTS are moving off into the distance in
dialog: different direction.)
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: My God! They're the same kind
dialog: of things that destroyed the
dialog: Klingons, Epsilon Nine...
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (interrupting; from
dialog: science console)
dialog: These read as identical composition...
dialog: (turns to Kirk)
dialog: ... however, Captain, they measure
dialog: several hundred times more
dialog: powerful!
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: High mag, Mr. Sulu!
text: Sulu adjusts the viewer through several IMAGE MAGNI-
text: FICATIONS until we SEE the huge OMINOUS GREEN DEVICES
text: more clearly.
speaker_heading: SULU
text: The third one is moving off too --
dialog: a fourth one is forming...
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: (overlapping)
text: Urgent signal from Starfleet,
dialog: Captain!
dialog: (turns, shaken)
dialog: All Earth defense systems have
dialog: gone dead.
text: Kirk reacts hard at this. Uhura gets another message.
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Sir, Starfleet computes their
text: trajectories as moving toward
text: equidistant positions over Earth.
text: 331 ANOTHER ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK 331
text: exchanging significant glances.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
text: From four equidistant positions,
dialog: Captain, a detonation would blanket
text: the entire surface of the planet.
speaker_heading: DIFALCO
dialog: I plot them as reaching equidistant
dialog: positions in... twenty-nine
dialog: minutes, sir... mark!
text: 332 ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER AND "ILIA" 332
text: as Kirk vaults from his chair, strides to a handrail to
dialog: confront the "Ilia"-probe.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Why...?!
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: The carbon-units infection will
dialog: now be removed from the Creator's
dialog: planet.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Why?!
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: The Creator has not answered.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: The carbon-units are not
dialog: responsible for that.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: You infest and control Enterprise.
dialog: V'ger believes carbon-units interfere
dialog: with the Creator in the same manner.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (to Kirk)
dialog: Then V'ger believes the Creator to
dialog: be a machine too.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (nods)
dialog: It seems we all imagine God in our
text: own image.
text: 333 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER - INCLUDING CHEKOV (O) 333
text: 
text: Three of the four OMINOUS SWIRLING GREEN OBJECTS have
text: all moved away from V'ger now, in different directions,
text: growing smaller in the distance. The fourth object is
text: holding position nearby, seeming to grow in size and
text: intensity.
speaker_heading: 334 ANGLE EMPHASIZING KIRK 334
text: as he throws a look toward Spock who is now in deep
text: meditation. Kirk turns and takes "Ilia's" shoulders
text: and carefully turns her to face him.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: '... similar life forms...?'
dialog: Jim, V'ger's saying the Creator
dialog: is a machine...!
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (grimly amused)
dialog: Of course: we all create God
dialog: in our own image.
text: Kirk peers at Decker a moment, ingesting this thought.
text: Then he addresses "Ilia" again, this time with emotion:
dialog: after all, he is pleading for the survival of the
dialog: entire planet:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: V'ger! If we are lesser beings,
dialog: we are still, like you, living.
dialog: And because we are alive, we --
dialog: like you -- wish to survive.
dialog: You must not destroy --
text: 
text: Kirk pauses abruptly: "Ilia" is regarding him blandly,
text: stonily -- not the slightest reaction or response;
text: clearly Kirk's plea is being ignored.
text: Kirk draws in his breath to continue, realizes the
text: futility, turns helplessly to Spock.
text: 335 ACROSS KIRK TO SPOCK 335
text: who has been listening intently, with near fascination
text: -- an idea forming in his mind. Quickly, he steps
dialog: down to Kirk:
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (quiet, terse)
dialog: Captain...
dialog: (reaches Kirk)
dialog: Treat V'ger as you would... a
dialog: child.
dialog: 336 FAVORING KIRK 336
text: 
text: startled at this, not sure he's heard correctly.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Child...!?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Yes, Captain, a child: evolving
dialog: into adulthood -- learning, searching
text: -- instinctively needing.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: Needing what...?
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Spock, this 'child' is about
dialog: to eliminate all life on Earth;
dialog: how do we teach it that that's
dialog: 'wrong'? With a spanking...!?
text: Spock peers at McCoy almost sadly, then replies to
dialog: Decker.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: It doesn't know what it needs,
dialog: Comm ander...
dialog: (to Kirk)
dialog: It does not know.
text: Kirk says nothing, looks at Spock who is awaiting a
text: reaction; then Kirk glances at "Ilia" -- his brain
text: is racing, struggling to reach a decision. And then:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (abruptly to
dialog: "Ilia")
dialog: The carbon--units-know-why-the
dialog: Creator-has-not-responded.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Jim...!
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (to "Ilia,"
dialog: urgingly)
dialog: Ilia... we can help V'ger
dialog: find what it needs --
text: "Ilia" studies Decker just a bland beat, then turns
dialog: to Kirk:
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: (to Kirk, hard)
dialog: Disclose the information.
text: 
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (cool, calm)
dialog: Not until V'ger withdraws the
dialog: devices orbiting the third planet.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE
dialog: INFORMATION!
text: Kirk studies her a moment, then decides to press his
dialog: bet:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (to "Ilia," almost
dialog: pleasant)
dialog: No.
dialog: (then to crew
dialog: commandingly)
dialog: Secure all stations. Clear
text: the bridge.
text: A moment where all are startled at this order -- but
text: no time for questions as just then the ship is ROCKED
text: BY A FURIOUS POWERFUL ERUPTION NEARBY within V'ger.

speaker_heading: SULU
dialog: Clear the bridge, Captain...?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: That was the order, Mr. Sulu:
dialog: Clear the bridge.
text: Just then another ERUPTION -- the ship is ROCKED AGAIN.
scene_heading: 337 INT. INSIDE V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE 337
text: rocked about by the furious powerfields -- with
text: frightening displays of ray energy.
scene_heading: 338 INT. BRIDGE 338
text: as all react to the powerful blasts, holding on to
text: railings, etc, at the same time attempting to secure
text: their stations for the evacuation. The DAMAGE REPAIR
text: TECHNICIAN leaves his station, crossing to exit.
speaker_heading: DAMAGE TECH.
dialog: (leaving bridge;
dialog: to Captain)
dialog: Severe stress on engine pylons,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: (to Kirk; flat)
dialog: V'ger requires the information.
text: Kirk merely looks at her, then to the evacuating crew:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Bridge secure all stations!
dialog: Move out!
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Jim, what the hell kind of
dialog: strategy is this...?
text: Meanwhile, Decker has crossed to Chekov's now abandoned
text: console, checks it.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: All ship's functions going to
dialog: automatic, Captain.
text: 
text: 339 ANGLE ON KIRK 339
text: turning to confront "Ilia":
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: If V'ger destroys the Enterprise,
dialog: the information V'ger requires
dialog: will also be destroyed.
text: 
speaker_heading: 339A INCLUDING VIEWER 339A
text: as LIGHT SHOW outside perceptically recedes, and simul-
text: taneously the ROCKING CEASES. At the same time, "Ilia"
dialog: is saying:
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: It is illogical to withhold
dialog: required information.
text: Kirk does not reply to this, turns away to observe
text: the withdrawing crew. Most are out; only Spock,
text: Decker and McCoy remain behind -- with McCoy on his
text: way. The bridge lighting dims, and now Kirk looks at
text: Spock, who nods approvingly; clearly Spock is the only
text: person who seems to comprehend what Kirk is doing, and
text: why. As Kirk now moves toward the exit, and the lights
dialog: are dimmed even further:
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: (almost polite)
dialog: Kirk-unit, why do you not
dialog: disclose information?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Because V'ger is going to
dialog: destroy all the carbon units
dialog: on the third planet.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: They have repressed the Creator.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: The information will not be
dialog: disclosed.
text: And, gesturing the others ahead of him, Kirk starts
text: toward the bridge elevator. "Ilia" calls after him:
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: (almost a plea)
dialog: V'ger needs the information.
text: 340 AT THE ELEVATORS 340
text: 
text: Decker and McCoy about to enter, Spock and Kirk just
text: behind -- all stopping abruptly now at "Ilia's" state-
text: ment. The very tone of her voice is enough for them
text: to realize they have made a very telling point. Kirk
text: follows fast:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Then V'ger must withdraw its
dialog: orbiting devices.
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: V'ger will comply if the carbon
dialog: units disclose the information.
text: 341 ANGLE ON McCOY 341
text: wryly reacting to this:
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: It learns fast, doesn't it...?
text: 342 ACROSS McCOY TO KIRK AND SPOCK 342
text: as Kirk looks at Spock, Kirk's whole expression convey-
dialog: ing the obvious question: "What the hell do we do now?"
dialog: But Spock is ready with an answer:
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Captain, the vessel -- V'ger --
dialog: obviously operates from a
dialog: central brain complex...
text: Spock allows the sentence to hang, as he and Kirk
text: eye each other significantly, the CAMERA SWINGING
text: OVER TO KIRK so we can perceive that to Kirk this
dialog: idea has an even greater significance.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (to Spock)
dialog: The orbiting devices would be
dialog: controlled from the point,
dialog: then...?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Precisely.
text: Kirk nods grimly, faces "Ilia" again; this time
dialog: he's playing for all the stakes.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: The carbon units' information
dialog: cannot be disclosed to V'ger's
text: probe... only to V'ger directly.
speaker_heading: 343 ANOTHER ANGLE - REACTIONS 343
text: all wait with hushed expectancy, all eyes on "Ilia"
text: who seems momentarily in some internal communication.
text: She turns away from Kirk and steps forward looking at
dialog: the Main Viewer.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (indicating
dialog: viewer)
dialog: Jim...!
text: 344 PAST THEM TO VIEWER 344
text: the image of the chamber in which the Enterprise is
text: imprisoned. But now, toward the chamber-end, where
dialog: further passage had previously been barred by the lace-
text: work energy barriers -- an OPENING APPEARS. And at
text: the same time there is a GENTLE LURCHING EFFECT, and:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Forward motion, Captain...!
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: A tractor beam...
text: "Ilia" steps down from the platform and into the well
text: where she is closer to the viewer.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Captain, what's the next move?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: The question is, Mr. Decker, is
dialog: there a next move...
scene_heading: 345 INT. V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE 345
text: moving through the chamber, pulled by the invisible
text: tractor beam, toward the OPENING -- toward the next
text: chamber which, from this POV seems even larger,
dialog: more forbidding.
scene_heading: 346 INT. BRIDGE 346
text: as the four officers step down onto the bridge, Spock
text: hurrying to his science station, Kirk to the center
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Resume duty stations, Mr. Decker.
text: As Kirk attends to his console, Deck is at an
text: intercom:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (into intercom,
dialog: voice amplified)
dialog: All personnel resume stations...!
text: At the same time the lights are brightening -- and
text: members of the bridge crew begin returning. All this
text: time there is an ever increasing sense of movement.
text: Kirk glances at Decker:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my
dialog: bluff is being called.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: I'm afraid our hand is pretty
dialog: weak, Captain.
dialog: (slight smile)
dialog: But it's the only game in town.
text: 
text: Kirk reacts, pleased, a split beat at Decker's "our"
text: hand, and goes on:
text: Kirk throws him a look of appreciation, then, abruptly
text: his manner changes as he addresses Chekov:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Mr. Chekov, when do those devices
dialog: activate?
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: They reach final position in...
dialog: Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (a beat; then into
dialog: intercom)
dialog: Engineering...
scene_heading: 347 INT. ENGINEERING - SCOTT 347
text: at his console, a female engineering technician (CHIEF
text: ROSS) nearby, the usual engine room ambience in the
dialog: b.g., as:
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Scott, here, sir.
scene_heading: 348 INT. BRIDGE - KIRK WITH AN ANGLE ON SPOCK 348
text: as Kirk hesitates, glances around at the crew -- now
dialog: all having resumed their stations -- and then grimly
text: looks at "Ilia" who still remains at the rail.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (into intercom,
dialog: eyes on "Ilia")
dialog: Mr. Scott, be prepared to execute
dialog: Starfleet order two zero zero
dialog: five.
text: Hearing this, Spock whirls around -- peers incredulously
text: at Kirk. He appears for a moment to be incensed at
text: Kirk's words. Then he realizes and understands Kirk's
text: position and turns, sadly resigned, back to his work.
scene_heading: 349 INT. ENGINEERING 349
text: as Scott, too, hears this, but his reaction is of grim
text: acceptance. Not so Chief Ross; she is horrified.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (with a glance at
dialog: Ross, into intercom)
dialog: When, Captain?
speaker_heading: KIRK'S INTERCOM VOICE
dialog: On my command.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (somberly, into
dialog: intercom)
dialog: Aye, sir.
text: And Scott hits buttons on his console, now moves to
text: step from his station, nearly collides with Ross, who
text: clearly is bravely struggling to maintain her poise
dialog: and dignity:
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Why has the Captain ordered self-
dialog: destruct, sir?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (a beat; gently)
dialog: I would say, lass, because he
dialog: thinks -- he hopes -- that when
dialog: we go up... we'll take V'ger
dialog: with us.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Will we?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (with grim
dialog: satisfaction)
dialog: When that much matter and anti-
dialog: matter are brought together?
dialog: Oh, yes; we will, indeed.
scene_heading: 350 EXT. ENTERPRISE - INT. V'GER 350
text: The ship passing now through a chamber that is vastly
text: more active than anything we have previously seen.
text: Directly ahead appears to be an area that dispatches
dialog: powerfields; a tremendous volume of them seem to ema-
dialog: nate and converge there. The medium from which the
text: ship moves appears almost solid, to the point where it
dialog: seems incredible that the ship can be pulled through
text: it at all. The entire chamber pulses with machine-
dialog: like, alien life. This should even be evidenced in the
text: booming POWERFIELD LIGHTENING BOLTS as they course in
text: ever more frighteningly close proximity to the ship as:
scene_heading: 350A INT BRIDGE - INCLUDING THE VIEWER 350A
text: The crew all watching the awesome spectacle of V'ger's
text: interior (on the viewer) as the Enterprise is being
text: pulled toward the brain complex. All are somewhat sub-
dialog: dued, for all realize how their journey will end -- but
dialog: at the same time they also realize there is no other
text: way. The CAMERA PANS, catching facial reactions -- as,
text: in the b.g., we HEAR a constant flow of AD-LIBBED crew
dialog: comments:
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: Twenty-five minutes to device
dialog: activation, sir.
dialog: ALT. (Twenty-two)
dialog: ALT. (Eighteen)
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: Starfleet has been apprised of
dialog: our situation, Captain.
speaker_heading: SULU
dialog: Tractor beam remains constant...
speaker_heading: DIFALCO
dialog: We are seventeen kilometers inside
dialog: the vessel...
text: 351 ANGLE ON SPOCK 351
text: His back to the viewer, the angle does not reveal his
text: facial features, but we can discern him struggling to
dialog: contain his feelings.
dialog: 352 WIDER ANGLE (INCLUDE KIRK, McCOY, AND DECKER) 352
text: Kirk's back to Spock as he watches the viewer, Kirk
text: now turning toward Spock.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Spock... Spock...
text: Spock does not respond, then Kirk reacts with momentary
text: annoyance, then realizes Spock is totally distracted.
text: Kirk peers at him a moment, then suddenly rises and
text: steps up to:
text: 353 SPOCK'S STATION - KIRK AND SPOCK (McCOY IN B.G.) 353
text: as Kirk arrives, with Spock still facing away from
text: him, clearly distracted.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (starts)
dialog: Mr. Spock -- I think...
text: Spock moves to face him, turning fully INTO the CAMERA
text: so we can see now, just under Spock's eye:
text: A tear! Welling fom the eye, rolling down his cheek.
text: Kirk is speechless a moment, glances at McCoy who has
dialog: also witnessed this phenomenon, and started toward
text: Spock; but Kirk gestures McCoy to stay back, as he
dialog: addresses Spock:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (quiet, feeling)
dialog: Not for us?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
text: 
text: Spock pauses as Kirk peers incredulously at him, then
text: continues:
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I weep for V'ger, as I would for
dialog: a brother -- far more knowledgeable
dialog: than I -- and yet one step behind.
text: 354 ANGLE ON McCOY AND DECKER 354
text: Listening, McCoy's face reflecting concern; Decker's
dialog: face compassion and understanding, with Decker step-
text: ping closer to Spock, as Spock continues:
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: As I was -- when I came aboard...
text: so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete.
dialog: Searching. Logic and knowledge are
dialog: not enough.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: (with empathy)
dialog: Spock, are you saying that you
dialog: found, what you needed -- but V'ger
dialog: hasn't?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Has not, Doctor -- and now, because
dialog: of what we are planning... will not...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (almost hard)
dialog: There is no alternative.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (gently pressing)
dialog: Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need
dialog: to fulfill itself?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: V'ger has begun to understand the
dialog: true limits of our universe,
dialog: thereby realizing the existence
dialog: of other dimensions. To fulfill
dialog: itself it must evolve to a
dialog: higher dimension; V'ger believes
dialog: this can be achieved only by
dialog: joining with the Creator.
speaker_heading: SPOCK (ALTERNATIVE)
dialog: Each of us, at some time in our
dialog: life, turns to someone, a father,
dialog: a brother, a God and asks 'Why
dialog: am I here?' 'What was I meant
dialog: to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its
dialog: Creator to find its answers.
text: 355 ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER 355

text: reacting to the (O.S.) viewer, AD-LIBBING a terse:
speaker_heading: DIFALCO
dialog: Captain...!
text: PAST KIRK AND SPOCK TO THE VIEWER
text: 
text: where another opening is suddenly visible -- another
text: chamber. But the violent and color energy effects of
text: the previous chambers are no longer evident. Instead,
text: the entire chamber appears beautifully symmetrical,
text: with a strange, subdued glow, which increases as we
text: move closer.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (flat)
dialog: Captain, I believe that is our
text: destination.
text: 
scene_heading: 356 EXT. ENTERRISE - INT. V'GER - NEAR THE "ISLAND" 356
speaker_heading: COMPLEX
text: This enormous chamber resembles a hemisphere, laced
text: throughout with dazzling energy patterns, not at all
text: ominous, but quite lovely in effect. As the Enterprise
dialog: continues forward motion, now ahead you will to SEE a
text: small "island." Floating in the exact center of the
text: hemisphere, the "island" seems alive with PULSING LIGHT,
text: with more of the lovely and delicate ENERGY FORMS and

dialog: pears to be a "solid" matter form.
scene_heading: 357 INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER 357
text: The "island" looming larger in the distance. And the
text: Enterprise (as evidenced from the viewer) perceptibly

speaker_heading: SULU

scene_heading: 359 EXT. ENTERPRISE (INT. V'GER) 359
text: The Enterprise approaching the edge of the "island" --
text: slowing, but still quite clearly being pulled by the

speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Captain, we can't be sure that our...

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No!

text: 363 INCLUDING THE VIEWER KIRK AND THE OTHERS 363
text: all very silent a moment, gazing at the sight. Now
text: Kirk glances at the people around him: on his command
dialog: their lives are about to end. Nothing is said; no

dialog: No need to.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (into intercom:
dialog: with finality)
dialog: Mr. Scott...
text: 364 ANGLE ON CHEKOV 364
text: reacting to a console reading with surprise.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: Captain... I read an oxygen and
dialog: gravity envelope forming outside
dialog: the Enterprise...!
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: Sir, I have located the source
dialog: of V'ger's radio signal: (it's)

speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: That transmitter is a vital link

speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (urging)
dialog: (ALT. "18",) We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,
dialog: (.... "14" ) we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
text: All this has caused Kirk to vacillate, but he still
dialog: believes his course of action is the proper one, as:-
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: The carbon units will now provide
dialog: V'ger the required information.
text: "Ilia" is moving toward the elevator, turning to face
text: the others as she says this. Kirk remains frozen, his
text: hand on the intercom button. He glances at McCoy, as
text: though seeking advice. McCoy peers at him blandly,
text: levelly; Kirk must follow his own instinct.
speaker_heading: 365 FAVORING KIRK 365
text: gazing at "Ilia," then at Spock, his brain racing, con-
text: sidering all the possibilities, options. He glances
text: at the anxious faces awaiting his decision: a possible
dialog: twenty-two more minutes of life -- or instant death.
text: Another beat as he decides. Then:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (into intercom)
dialog: Mr. Scott... we're holding off;
dialog: there may be a chance...
dialog: (rises, gestures
dialog: Spock and McCoy)
dialog: Spock, Bones...

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Mr. Decker... I will contact you
dialog: every five minutes. Otherwise...
dialog: inform Mr. Scott immediately.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: (calls after him)
dialog: Captain... I'd like to go along...
text: Kirk studies Decker a beat -- there is something com-
text: pelling about Decker's manner -- a certain sense of
text: absolute necessity. Kirk seems about to deny the re-
text: quest, then turns to Sulu:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Mr. Sulu, you have the conn...
text: And Kirk leaves; Decker, his face reflecting a strange,
text: almost eager gratification, hurries after him.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: V'ger plans to literally meld
dialog: to reduce both itself and the
dialog: Creator to patterns...
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: ... and then to reassemble itself
dialog: combined with the Creator. The
dialog: most certain way of obtaining
dialog: all the Creator's answers.
text: A sudden STORM OF LIGHT AND STRANGE SOUND. In the
text: midst of it, Kirk finds a SHAFT OF LIGHT very much
text: centering on him. He sees "Ilia" watching him with
text: none of their "former navigator" in her expression
text: now. Kirk hesitates, gathering his thoughts:
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (to "Ilia")
dialog: Our data is being prepared.
text: 
speaker_heading: "ILIA"
dialog: Answer!
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: We will answer and present proof
dialog: of our answer when it is ready!
text: Kirk's words lead to a suggestion of FRUSTRATION in the
text: STORM OF LIGHT AND SOUND around them.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: V'ger, we will bring the Creator
dialog: to you! Here!
text: 367 ANGLE EMPHASIZING "ILIA" AND DECKER 367
text: as he moves to her:
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: We need only a few more minutes.
dialog: Believe me...
text: Decker has reached out to touch her -- the probe spins
text: at his touch -- the move knocks Decker from his feet,
text: tumbling, a hard fall. Then the robe looks at him
text: lying there -- just the slightest softening of her
text: features now.
speaker_heading: 368 EMPHASIZING DECKER 368
text: slowly turning to face the probe again.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Ilia, believe me... the Creator
dialog: will appear!
dialog: 369 EMPHASIZING "ILIA" 369

speaker_heading: "ILIA"

speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: And when it realizes what the

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: There's no way to know. V'ger
dialog: expected it to be a machine --
dialog: some single entity.
dialog: (indicates entire
dialog: site)
dialog: All of us here may be reduced
dialog: into patterns...
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: That seems to be what it has
dialog: planned -- to have the Creator

speaker_heading: McCOY

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing;
dialog: into communicator)
dialog: Kirk here.
speaker_heading: UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE
dialog: We now have the response code,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Stand by. Transmit it on my

text: The three of them exchange looks -- Kirk, Spock and

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Enterprise... transmit.
dialog: 376 DECKER AND "ILIA" 376
text: catching Decker in the midst of pressing a control on
text: his tricorder. Both he and "Ilia" are watching Kirk

speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: Recording...
text: 377 KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY 377

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Enterprise, are you transmitting?
speaker_heading: UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE
dialog: Affirmative, Captain. For some

speaker_heading: KIRK

dialog: (indicating into
dialog: hatch)
dialog: The antenna leads have been
dialog: disconnected. V'ger never
dialog: intended to accept a transmitted
text: signal.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Capture God! In order to
dialog: retrieve V'ger's data, the
dialog: Creator has to physically come
dialog: here!...
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: And plug the signal directly into
dialog: the circuitry at this...
dialog: (indicates into
dialog: access)
dialog: ... point here, Captain. It
dialog: should pick up even a tricorder
dialog: playback.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (lifting communicator)
dialog: Enterprise, I want that signal
dialog: again. Transmit!
text: Then Kirk touches a control on his tricorder exactly
text: as Decker did earlier. Then he looks up, reacts as
text: he sees Decker holding his own tricorder up -- and a
text: smile playing on Decker's face.
dialog: 379 ACTION ANGLE 379
text: as Kirk suddenly pivots, races toward Decker -- but he
text: passes too close to the "Ilia"-probe. It sends him
text: spinning back, tumbling to his knees.
dialog: 380 AT KIRK 380
text: as KIRK starts up to scramble to his feet but Spock has
text: stepped in, putting a hand on Kirk's shoulder and re
text: straining him.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Jim... he wants it.
speaker_heading: DECKER
dialog: You got the Enterprise, it's
dialog: what you wanted. This is what
dialog: I want.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: But, Jim...
dialog: (now very seriously)
dialog: ... I'm the right choice for this
dialog: mission.
text: And then Decker shoves the tricorder into the access
text: hatch.
text: 381 VARIOUS EFFECTS SHOTS - DECKER BEING FUSED - V'GER 381
speaker_heading: TRANSCENDING (S)
text: For just an instant nothing happens -- and then a
text: BLINDING SHAFT OF LIGHT STRIKES Decker. The color
text: becomes BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER, begins spiraling through
text: the room. "Ilia" stes toward Decker, is caught in the
text: LIGHT, and instantly VANISHES in a BRILLIANT WHITE GLOW.
text: We SEE Decker seeming to grow larger -- as if his
text: molecular pattern is expanding. A SPECTACULAR SERIES
text: OF VISUALS., THE SPIRALING LIGHT enveloping the entire
dialog: area.
text: All this emanating from Decker's body, becoming LARGER
text: -- also BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER until now it is almost
text: transparent. And the SPIRALING now expanding in all
text: directions, and the room itself starting to dissolve,
text: vanishing into nothingness -- and all commencing to
dialog: slip into the new dimension.
text: Kirk, Spock and McCoy stand transfixed another instant.
text: Around them, V'ger seems to be TRANSFORMING INTO BRIL-
text: LIANT, LOVELY PATTERNS. They all turn and race into
text: the complex in the direction of their vessel.
scene_heading: 382 EXT. EARTH ORBIT - AN ENERGY BOLT (S) 382
text: It too seems to be flowering into loveliness, brilliant,
text: graceful patterns as they seem to slip through to another
text: dimension, vanishing.
scene_heading: 383 EXT. V'GER - FULL SHOT 383
text: 
text: The "FLOWERING" EFFECT now spreading outward, V'ger's
text: massive shape becoming a spiraling pattern of twisting,
text: graceful shapes and brilliant colors -- a transcendence
dialog: into another dimension.
text: And then all of that is left is a shimmering, jewel-like
text: point of light -- and then it too fades -- and reveals
text: there in the blue-black of space, the U.S.S. Enterprise.
scene_heading: 384 INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING THE VIEWER (O) 384
dialog: which shows now only space and its familiar star
text: patterns. All gaze at the viewer, awed at what they've
text: seen and undergone. They exchange looks silently, no
dialog: one wanting to be the first to try to comment on some-
text: thing which is beyond mere words. We HEAR an ELEVATOR
text: DOOR, Scott and Chapel ENTER the bridge and stand
text: silently watching.
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Well, it certainly has been...
dialog: interesting.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Spock, we were its answer!
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Yes, Captain. It needed our
dialog: mortality, the fear of it, our
dialog: struggle against it, our fears,
dialog: our dreams...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: ... and the 'foolish' emotions
dialog: which drive us?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (looks at Kirk; then)
dialog: I prefer your poet Dante's phrase
dialog: -- 'the divine restlessness of
dialog: the human spirit.'
speaker_heading: McCOY
dialog: Spock... you're quoting poetry?
text: Spock's cold look at McCoy is interrupted by:
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: Starfleet signal, Captain!
dialog: Return to orbital dockyard for
dialog: inspection.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Ignore that signal.
dialog: (to Scott)
dialog: Shall we give the Enterprise a
dialog: proper shakedown, Mr. Scott?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (suddenly beaming)
dialog: I'd say it's time for that, I
dialog: would, sir.
dialog: (toward Spock)
dialog: We can have you back on Vulcan
dialog: in four days, Mr. Spock.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: I have no business on Vulcan,
dialog: Engineer.
text: Kirk and Spock exchange a look -- then Kirk turns to
text: the helm.
speaker_heading: KIRK
text: Ahead Warp One, Mr. Sulu.
speaker_heading: DIFALCO
dialog: Heading, sir?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (taking center seat;
dialog: indicates generally)
dialog: Out there. Thataway.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: (nods gravely)
dialog: A most logical choice, Captain.
text: Then the trace of a smile comes over Spock's face.
scene_heading: 385 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (S) 385
text: Planet Earth in the distance, and receding in size as
text: the starship heads out the other direction.
text: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
