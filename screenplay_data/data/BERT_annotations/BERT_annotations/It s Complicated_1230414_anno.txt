text: A late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara

text: Brazilian music as guests carry drinks and nibble on dessert.
scene_heading: 2 CLOSE - ON A FOURSOME OF FRIENDS 2
dialog: The Couple who live in this house, SALLY AND TED, drink
text: champagne as they chat with their closest friends, JANE AND
speaker_heading: JAKE.
text: JANE is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact. She knows 50
dialog: is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described
dialog: by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this
text: woman's appearance screams "solid."
dialog: The years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks,
text: his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his
dialog: glass of champagne.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Happy happy happy...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (reminding him)
dialog: -- Anniversary.
text: Jake pauses, wryly turns to Jane, making her smile.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Some things never change.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Thank God.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I thought maybe you were drifting.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: He was pausing.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Exactly....
text: (sighs, raising his glass)
dialog: Happy... Anniversary. You two have
dialog: led an extraordinarily blessed
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: JAKE(cont'd)
dialog: As long as I've known you both,
dialog: you've always managed to somehow do
dialog: everything entirely right.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: -- That's so true.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But, honestly, how can it be thirty
dialog: years!?! When did we do that trip
dialog: to Spain?
dialog: (looks to Jane)
dialog: It was for both of our what..?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: -- Fifteenth anniversaries.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: God, that was a great trip...
text: The Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall, ADORABLE 21
text: YEAR OLD BOY joins the group, holding a bottle of beer. This
text: is OLIVER, Sally and Ted's son. All four light up as Oliver
text: puts his arm around his Mom.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Ollie, how was graduation?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It was fantastic. I can't believe
dialog: I'm not in school anymore. When's
dialog: Luke's graduation?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Next week.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (correcting him)
dialog: It's in three days!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sorry! I mean this week.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Are the girls going?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: They can't wait.
text: Jane glances across the party and sees AGNESS, A FREE
text: SPIRITED PRETTY WOMAN in her thirties, wearing a sarong over
text: a bathing suit and walking directly toward them. She carries
text: a slice of cake. Jane becomes instantly distracted and
dialog: uncomfortable.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: How long is Luke home before he has
dialog: to go back for work?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: -- Only a week...
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Aw, that's it?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know, I hate it. Well...
dialog: (Agness joins the group,
dialog: standing next to Jake)
dialog: Congrats again...
dialog: (puts down her champagne)
dialog: Great party...
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You're leaving?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah, I have some

dialog: (to Jake &amp; Agness)
dialog: I'll see you two in New York.
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: Absolutely. Lookin' forward to it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Good. Well....
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: -- Jane, what are you wearing to
dialog: the graduation?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, a suit or dress, probably a
dialog: suit.
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: Fancy. Okay.
text: Jane smiles tightly, raises her eyebrows to Sally.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: See you there, Janey. Where are
dialog: you staying again?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: We're at The Park Regent. You said
dialog: you were at The Four Seasons,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (to Agness)
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: We're at The Park Regent too.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (hates this)
dialog: Oh. Good. That'll be convenient,

speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: -- I'll walk you out.

speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: So, Ted, do you think you can help

dialog: kindergarten?
scene_heading: ANGLE - JANE AND SALLY - WALKING INTO HOUSE
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I thought it was sweet how well you
dialog: and Jake were getting along. Felt
dialog: like old times.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah, well, we know how to do this
dialog: by now. It has been ten years.
speaker_heading: SALLY

scene_heading: EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
text: The house is modest and charming and sits on a few acres in

text: has an air of maturity about her.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Gabby, stop...you're never going to

speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Oh, God...that's all my clothes.
speaker_heading: HARLEY

speaker_heading: HARLEY(cont'd)
dialog: Okay, your Mom is home. She'll
dialog: figure this out.
text: The SUV pulls to a stop, Jane gets out. Gabby starts pulling
text: cartons out of her trunk to make room for her clothes.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Gabby, you're leaving now? I
dialog: thought you were going in the
dialog: morning?
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: I know but my friends are all there
dialog: and they wanted me to come tonight.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: But honey, it's gonna get dark
dialog: soon. You can't see out the back
text: window. It's Saturday night.
dialog: People will be on the road
dialog: drinking...
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Mom, she'll be there in a couple of
dialog: hours, she'll be fine.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Okay, I'm leaving this stuff here.
dialog: I'll be back for it in a few days.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Want me to drive it down in the
dialog: morning?
speaker_heading: (Gabby's BLACKBERRY
text: BUZZES, she laughs,
dialog: thumbs flying)
dialog: I could be there by lunch. We could

dialog: can you look up from that thing??
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: I got it covered, Ma.
dialog: (to Harley)
dialog: Hey gangsta, help me carry these...
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: (exhausted)
dialog: Yep....
text: Gabby and Harley CARRY THE BOXES back into the house. Jane
text: seems worried as she watches them.

speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the
dialog: house alone?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What are you....? No!
dialog: (Lauren looks doubtful)
dialog: -- I'm not! One of you is always
dialog: moving out...
dialog: (Gabby re-joins)
dialog: But I am wondering who I'm gonna
dialog: watch The Hills with?
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: (huge hug)
dialog: Mamacita... I'm gonna miss you.
text: Jane hugs her back, but is aware of not hugging too hard.
text: Harley joins the group.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I'm doing
dialog: this.
dialog: (walks to her car)
dialog: Mom, you don't happen to know where
dialog: Dad is, do you? I tried calling
dialog: him to say goodbye...
speaker_heading: JANE
text: He was at Sally and Ted's.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: He was? How was that? You and
dialog: them at the same --
dialog: (Jane turns to him)
dialog: -- not that it's in any way, any of
dialog: my... was just...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: -- It was....
dialog: (notices both girls wait
dialog: for her answer)
dialog: -- whatever. It was fine.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Was her lunatic child there?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Not this time. Gabby, call me when
dialog: you get there. Do NOT forget.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: JANE(cont'd)
dialog: (Gabby texts, deep in
dialog: convo )
dialog: Gabby!
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: I will. I'll call you!
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Knock `em dead, little one.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: And call us when you get there,
text: too. And no texting and driving.
text: Jane loves that Harley said that. Gabby gets in her car and
text: starts off.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
text: (puts his arm around
dialog: Jane's shoulder)
dialog: They grow up so friggin' fast. I
dialog: hate it.
text: Gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Maybe you should get a dog.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh my God. Goodbye you two. Love
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: (heading for their car and
dialog: getting into the
dialog: passenger seat)
dialog: Love you boss!
text: As Lauren and Harley drive off, Jane turns and looks at her
text: suddenly very empty nest.
scene_heading: 4 INT. JANE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 4
text: A Woman's house. Books and art collected over years.
text: Interesting, unexpected pieces of furniture. Jane kicks off
text: her heels, now feeling short and alone. Deep breath!
scene_heading: 5 INT. KITCHEN 5
text: Cramped, but clearly a cook's kitchen. The Kids have left a
text: few glasses and plates on the island.
dialog: 9.
text: Jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink, she
text: suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone. She pauses,
text: allows herself the moment, then forces herself to snap out of
dialog: it.
scene_heading: 7 INT. THE BAKERY - MONTECITO - DAY 7
text: This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling
text: BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in
dialog: Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au
text: chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get
dialog: in.
text: A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving
text: between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and
dialog: friendly.
text: Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside
text: the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with
text: powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass-
text: through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Reynaldo...
dialog: (nods to the muffins)
speaker_heading: REYNALDO
dialog: Too much sugar.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Little bit.
text: Reynaldo nods as Jane hands him the tray.
text: Jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter.
text: Knowing what to do, Jane's staff has already set out cups of
text: coffee with lids.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Who wants coffee while they're
dialog: waiting?
text: Jane and the staff hand out the free coffee.
scene_heading: JANE WALKS THE COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER
text: refills a glass of water, checking on her customers.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (quietly to a Young
dialog: Employee)
dialog: Check on table five, will you?
dialog: 10.
text: The Young Employee nods as Jane looks up and sees a MAN on
text: the other side of the counter. They exchange polite hellos
text: when Jane notices PETER, tan and confident, approaching her.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (all smiles)
dialog: Peter!
text: PETER joins ADAM, the man who stands across from Jane. Adam
dialog: is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you. There's
text: something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor. He
text: holds rolled blueprints.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Jane, I can't remember, have you
dialog: ever met Adam Schaeffer?
speaker_heading: JANE ADAM
dialog: No. Yes.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Well....
dialog: (shrugs awkwardly )
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Look what we've got.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (raises the blueprints)
dialog: Your plans.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: So excited!
scene_heading: 8 INT. JANE'S SMALL OFFICE - UPSTAIRS AT THE BAKERY 8
text: A farmhouse table almost fills the room. On the walls,
text: posters for Jane's two cookbooks, framed food photos and a
dialog: few reviews.
text: Jane, Peter, and Adam sit around the table as Adam rolls out
text: the blueprints in front of Jane.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (before she looks)
dialog: I've been thinking about this
dialog: addition for ten years.
text: Peter and Adam watch as Jane's eagle eye examines the plan.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, niiice....I
dialog: like this wall of windows, Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That was Adam actually.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (still perusing, then to
dialog: Peter)
dialog: Love where you put the stairs.
dialog: That's so good!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Adam's idea...
dialog: Did she hear that?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh my God, the kitchen! Finally -
dialog: I have a real kitchen with four
dialog: walls... It's...oh, wow...you
dialog: actually understood what I wanted!
text: Jane looks to Peter with enormous appreciation. Peter looks
dialog: to Adam.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: All Adam.
text: Jane turns to Adam.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm happy you like it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (finally noticing him)
dialog: Okay. Hi.
dialog: (shakes his hand)
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You read all my e-mails.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: All 47 of them.
dialog: 12.
text: Jane smiles as her Office Manager sticks her head in the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: OFFICE MANAGER
dialog: Jane, it's 10:15.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It is?
dialog: (rises)
dialog: Oh, sorry, I have a 10:30...
dialog: dentist. Can you leave these and
dialog: I'll make a few notes? Well,
dialog: actually, I have one tiny note now.
dialog: (to Adam, re: plan)
dialog: In my bathroom...um...no his and
text: her sinks.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Okay, sure. No his?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Just hers.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: And you don't think in the future
dialog: you might want a his?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, God, we're talking code about
dialog: my life, right?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No, no, didn't mean to be.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: The truth is, in my current
dialog: bathroom, I have two sinks and
dialog: sometimes the other sink makes me
dialog: feel bad.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: One sink. Not a problem. Can we
dialog: schedule a meeting for next week?
dialog: Does Tuesday work for you?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Tuesday's great. Eight-thirty too
dialog: early? At the house?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'll be there.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: 9 INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING 9
text: Way too chic for a dentist's office. Jane sits nervously in
text: a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room.
text: The door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking DOCTOR
speaker_heading: ENTERS.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Hi. I'm Dr. Moss.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (shaking his hand)
dialog: Hi. Jane Adler. So, I just wanted
dialog: to start with... and please don't
dialog: take this the wrong way but I'm the
dialog: type of person who kind of makes
dialog: fun of people who get plastic
dialog: surgery.
speaker_heading: DR. MOSS
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You do? Good, because, you know,
dialog: some women can look a little fake
dialog: and plasticky. And in my opinion --
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: DR. MOSS
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, that's good, so, well, as
dialog: against the whole thing as I am, I
dialog: do have a problem that's been
text: bugging me. My left eyelid is
dialog: really saggy. I find I'm sometimes
dialog: holding it up when I'm watching TV
dialog: or reading and I was wondering if
dialog: that's something you could fix.
speaker_heading: DR. MOSS
dialog: (looking at her closely)
dialog: It's resting on your eye lashes.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Is it?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: DR. MOSS
text: (measures her lids with a
dialog: very tiny ruler)
dialog: Actually you have the same amount
text: of excess skin on both sides.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I do? Well, I'm only interested in
text: fixing one eye.
speaker_heading: DR. MOSS
dialog: Jane, what you need to fix this is
text: a brow lift.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: A brow lift? Wh-what is that
dialog: exactly?
speaker_heading: DR. MOSS
dialog: We surgically cut at your hair
text: line. Incision goes right across
dialog: here.
dialog: (demonstrates on himself
dialog: by indicating a line
dialog: drawn like a headband)
dialog: Then we just lift the skin up a
text: little tighter across the skull.
text: (Jane nods, already hating
dialog: this)
dialog: We staple it back in place right
dialog: above your ears. Recovery isn't
dialog: all that bad but you could be
dialog: fairly numb and you'll probably
dialog: have a headache that lasts anywhere
dialog: from say 3 to 6 months.
scene_heading: 10 INT. ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING 10
text: Jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little
text: nauseous. She taps on the Lobby button. The elevator moves
text: down. PING. The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks into an empty
text: hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility
dialog: Center. Helping Couples Become Parents.
text: Jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps
text: back toward the corner. A messy looking 5 YEAR OLD BOY
text: dashes in. Jane recognizes him. She looks up and Jake and
text: his wife, Agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black
text: dress (very Angelina Jolie) get on the elevator, obviously
text: mid-argument.
dialog: 15.
text: Agness' mood seems very dark today. They instantly shut up
text: when they realize Jane is in the elevator.
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: Jane!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: -- Hey..
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hiii.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: (pushing the Lobby button,
dialog: mumbles)
dialog: -- Perfect.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hold on Pedro, I'm talking to
dialog: someone.
text: Pedro sits on the floor, crashing into the back wall of the
dialog: elevator.
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: Pedro, up! Now!!
dialog: (she snaps)
text: Jane unconsciously holds up her left eyebrow.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What are you doing in this
dialog: building?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Dentist.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You don't go to Sharon anymore?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Uh, no... changed.
text: Jane looks at the fertility literature in Jake's hand just as
text: Jake slips it behind his back. An awful two seconds of
text: silence, then Jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on Agness'
text: back. It creeps her out.
dialog: 16.
text: Jake catches Jane's reaction, then thank God the doors open.
text: Jake leans down and picks up Pedro who instantly climbs up
dialog: his back.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Honey, don't do that..
text: 11 As they all EXIT THE ELEVATOR, Pedro has now made his way up
dialog: 11
text: to Jake's shoulders. Think chimpanzee. Agness' cell RINGS
text: and as she answers it --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: -- See you in the Big Apple.
text: Pedro is now resting on Jake's head.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (trying to be nonchalant
text: with a kid on his head,
dialog: smiles)
dialog: See you there.
scene_heading: 12 INT. JANE'S KITCHEN/DINING AREA - THAT NIGHT 12
text: Jane and THREE OF HER GIRLFRIENDS are mid-meal. The wine is

dialog: are all Jane's age and have been friends forever.
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: That is beyond....
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: -- When the three of them got in
dialog: the elevator... between that and
dialog: the staples and the headache for
dialog: six months... it was the most
dialog: insane hour of my life.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: -- Jake has lost his mind.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, I don't know...
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: I know. First of all, he was a
dialog: complete prick for cheating on you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, can't disagree with that.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: And then he marries her... a known
dialog: lunatic.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: She has a big job.
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: Why do you always say that?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Because she does. She runs the
dialog: whole marketing department at KY,
dialog: whatever that station's called so
dialog: she's not that big of a lunatic.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Janey, come on, he cheats on you
dialog: with her, your 20 year marriage
dialog: ends then six months later she
dialog: leaves Jake for some random guy,
dialog: has a baby, leaves that guy,
dialog: marries Jake and she's not nuts?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (groans)
dialog: Jo, you're so lucky Jerry's dead.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Oh, thanks.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No, I mean, you never have to bump
text: into him.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: That's true.
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: (rises to get more wine)
dialog: Janey, you want to meet a guy I met
dialog: on Match.com that I didn't like?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Gee, what a great offer. I don't
dialog: think so.
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: He wasn't that awful.
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Oooo. Sounding better every minute.
dialog: 18.
text: Trisha stops at Jane's seat, refilling Jane's wine glass.
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: You know it's not healthy not to
dialog: have sex for...however long it's
dialog: been...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Trust me... I'm not not doing it on
dialog: purpose.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Okay. I don't know if this is true,
dialog: but I read on line about this woman
dialog: who hadn't done it in so long her

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What!!! Get out of here.
dialog: All the Women SCREAM.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: I swear to God. It grew back
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Wait. Was it ever one piece?
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: All I know is, she had to have a

speaker_heading: TRISHA

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah....

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JANE

dialog: Sperm issues?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Apparently. Yes.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: A baby?! Really Jake? So...the

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: -- I think the number you're

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Okay. So. Seriously, how is that
dialog: good?
speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JAKE

text: another without inhibition. A mating dance....
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (astonished, laughing)
dialog: You're married to someone else...!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Tell me about it!

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why?

speaker_heading: JAKE

text: Jake sits on the edge of the tub. This is news to him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Really? I don't know.... I haven't

dialog: so something about it wasn't so
dialog: dumb.
text: (she stares up at him,
dialog: sick as a dog)
dialog: And, FYI, I like that you stopped

dialog: -- plus Harley, but he's like one
dialog: of us. I don't think we've ever
dialog: done this before... Had a meal
dialog: together. And hung out like
dialog: this...
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: You mean other than the first 13
dialog: years of your life.
speaker_heading: LUKE

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Jake, come on. This is just too
dialog: weird. We have to just never do
dialog: what we did - ever again. You're
dialog: an adulterer and I'm an awful
dialog: person, basically. I haven't slept
dialog: in days. What we did was just so
dialog: wrong on so many levels.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And it was so right on a couple of

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes! Because we're not supposed to

dialog: Unhappy at home? Does she not
dialog: "understand" you? Did you just
dialog: want to know what it would be like
dialog: with someone my age? What is this?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'd be lying if I said I never
dialog: think about you, Janey. I think
dialog: about you. A lot. And no, it's not
dialog: perfect at home. Obviously. Look
dialog: at me. I've got three grown kids
dialog: and I'm going to kindergarten
dialog: interviews. I'm a walking cliche.
text: Jane shrugs. She agrees.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And I can't, literally can't stop

dialog: once, maybe it happened again.
dialog: (she pauses...)
dialog: And I know... you've moved on with
dialog: your life, I get it, but you can't
dialog: deny something real and honest
dialog: happened that night. Can't we just
dialog: go with it, see where it takes us.
dialog: No one has to know.
dialog: (Jane shudders)
dialog: You were so great. So loose and
dialog: sexy. How often do you get to be
dialog: like that? You can run and open
dialog: restaurants and build your perfect
dialog: kitchen but what about having
dialog: someone to hold you in the middle
dialog: of the night...?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Not high on my list these days.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But what if that someone is someone
dialog: who's known you since you're 23 and
dialog: loved you for most of your life.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I forgot what a good lawyer you
dialog: are.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Give this a shot, Janey.... Life is
dialog: short and it's tough. Don't

dialog: other.

dialog: You know what they say... people in

scene_heading: 38 INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER 38
text: Jane and Jake have done it again. In broad daylight and
text: sober. They catch their breath.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, God, it's official. We're
dialog: having an affair.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why do you need to label
dialog: everything?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Because that's what this is.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes, in its crassest form, maybe,
dialog: if we were two other people.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Just because we were married for 19
dialog: years does not not make this an
dialog: affair.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Okay, but since we were together
dialog: for so long, it's not really that
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Really? You want to run that logic
dialog: by your wife?
dialog: Jane fans herself.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Do me a favor, you're on my side.
dialog: Can we switch? I feel disoriented.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Since when is this your side?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Since ten years ago. Please...
dialog: 40.
text: They switch sides. In the middle of this maneuver Jake lands
text: on top of Jane. He pauses.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Could I interest you in a little...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No!
text: They flop onto the opposite sides of the bed. Jane fans
dialog: herself. So hot.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (turns to her)
dialog: Why do you think the sex is so much
dialog: sexier this time?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't know.
text: Jane pulls the sheet up. They look at one another. He gets
dialog: her to smile.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I've gotta get to work.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Me too. Okay...
text: (moans as he sits up, then
dialog: rises)
text: Jake starts to get dressed. Jane watches him from bed,
text: checking out his stomach. He notices.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (indicating his belly)
dialog: See what happens when you're not
dialog: looking out for me.
dialog: (pats it)
dialog: She lets me eat everything.. pasta,
dialog: cream cheese...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Can you hand me my robe?
text: Jake reaches for Jane's robe, hands it to her. She indicates
dialog: Jake should turn around.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why do I have to..?
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: -- Because the last time you saw me
dialog: standing up naked I was in my
dialog: forties.
dialog: (Jake can't believe this)
text: Things look different lying down.
dialog: Just...
text: Jake rolls his eyes, turning away from her.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You've gotten a little nuts.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (slipping into her robe)
dialog: Jake, I think it would be really
dialog: good for us to not talk for a few
dialog: days. Okay?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (turning back to her)
dialog: You know what I think -- just for
dialog: the record? I think we're doing
dialog: something kinda brilliant. All the
dialog: things that tore us apart aren't
dialog: issues anymore. I'd say our
dialog: problems actually went away.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What..?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Didn't you always say you felt you
dialog: weren't being heard? Wasn't that
dialog: our big issue -- both of us always
text: feeling rejected and unappreciated.
dialog: Look at us now. You're so much
dialog: more together, you're not exhausted
dialog: all the time, you're not catering
dialog: every weekend and busy all day with
dialog: the kids and I'm calmer, less
dialog: obsessed about work. I'm a partner.
dialog: I'm there. We grew into the people
dialog: we wanted each other to be! And I
dialog: don't know... I appreciate things
dialog: about you I couldn't even see
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (not wanting to get into
dialog: it)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: JANE(cont'd)
dialog: Well, you know, I'm not as good as
dialog: you at remembering all the details
dialog: of our...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (getting dressed)
dialog: -- Do you remember never having
dialog: time for sex? Now look at us.
dialog: We've already done it two times
dialog: this week and it's only Tuesday. I
dialog: swear to God, if half the couples
dialog: who got divorced, could get back
dialog: together 10 years later, their
dialog: problems would be solved. I think
dialog: we're on to something.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Not sure I agree and...also, we're
dialog: not back together.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And I know other divorced people
dialog: think about this...they wonder -
dialog: what if....
dialog: (fixes his tie)
dialog: I think this is very French of us.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How is this French of us?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I have a young wife but I'm having
dialog: sex with my old wife. Not old, you
dialog: know. Ex!
dialog: (Jane nods....)
dialog: I didn't mean old...
text: 39 Jane tosses Jake his jacket. They EXIT the BEDROOM and head
dialog: 39
text: toward THE FRONT DOOR.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You're doing that thing where you
dialog: act like you're not listening...
dialog: but think about what I'm saying,
dialog: okay?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Do you have any of your homemade
dialog: granola here? I haven't had it in
dialog: so long.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You miss it?
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So much.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: We sell it for $6.50 a bag at the
dialog: store.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah, why give it away when you
dialog: can...
dialog: (Jane OPENS the front door
dialog: and moves him outside)
dialog: Kiss good bye?
text: Jane kisses him on the cheek.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: She wants to be courted!
text: (as he heads for his car)
dialog: I can do that!
dialog: (turns back)
dialog: And honey, thanks for the....
dialog: (indicates sex with his
dialog: fingers)
dialog: -- Coffee....
text: Jane can't close the door fast enough.
scene_heading: 40 INT. JANE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 40
text: Jane carries three beautiful homemade pies, arriving in THE
text: LIVING ROOM where her Friends are gathered. Platters of food
text: and open bottles of wine are on the coffee table.
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: Oh my God, now what? Three pies?!
dialog: This is a feast!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't know what's going on, I
dialog: have so much energy lately which I
dialog: think is probably a result of...
dialog: all the sex I'm having.
speaker_heading: (the Ladies LAUGH)
dialog: Yeah. I'm actually not kidding.
dialog: I'm having an affair.
dialog: (They stare at her)
text: With a married man.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: What? When did this happen?
dialog: Where'd you meet him?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, it... started in New York.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: In New York??? Last week?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah, we did it once there and once
dialog: here. Maybe more than once there,
dialog: I was drunk so...
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: You had drunken sex with a married
dialog: man in New York when you went for
dialog: Luke's graduation?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (laughs, embarrassed)
dialog: Turns out I'm a bit of a slut.
dialog: (re: pies)
dialog: Apple, Blueberry or Plum?
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Wait, wait, wait. Hold on....
dialog: You're not saying!!!!
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: (clueless)
dialog: -- What?
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: No! You're not!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, God, but I am. I'm having an
dialog: affair with Agness Adler's husband.
text: The Women all SCREAM as Jane fans herself.
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: That. Is. Genius!
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: But also sort of wrong.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Oh, please. Not that wrong.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know! I'm so happy to be able to
dialog: tell someone. This is the most out
dialog: of control thing I've ever done.
dialog: Literally. You know me.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Yes we do. You don't do anything
dialog: wrong, or bad. Ever. So you're
dialog: allowed this one. I'm sorry ... I
dialog: kinda love it.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: He was yours first.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: True. Not that I want him back by
dialog: the way.
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: Of course not. You can do better
dialog: than Jake.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (a little insulted)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: I mean you've outgrown him. You've
dialog: blossomed, you feng shuied your
dialog: whole life... Just please, don't
dialog: let him talk you into saving him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I won't...
dialog: (wonders what that means)
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: There is something kinda perfect
dialog: about this. You don't have to cook
dialog: for him or clean up after him or
dialog: actually even sleep with him....
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah, I have an Ex with benefits...
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: But, girls, what about the fact
dialog: that I'm now the other woman? I'm
dialog: the one we hate.
speaker_heading: TRISHA
dialog: Oh, forget that. Agness is still
dialog: the one we hate. Even in this
dialog: scenario.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Yeah, karma is the ultimate bitch
dialog: on this one.
scene_heading: 41 INT. BAKERY KITCHEN - DAY 41
text: Jane walks through the busy kitchen holding a sheet of paper.
text: Her shirt is a little more fitted. Her make up, a little
text: prettier. She crosses to the head Baker who's just taking a
text: tray of cookies out of the oven.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Reynaldo, I'm changing the
dialog: breakfast menu, want to give it a
dialog: little more life...
dialog: (shows it to him, he seems
dialog: distracted)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: REYNALDO
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: -- What'd you do? Something to
dialog: your hair?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: REYNALDO
dialog: Something about you looks
dialog: different. Little more "caliente."
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Caliente?
text: Another Chef in the kitchen nods in agreement.
speaker_heading: REYNALDO
dialog: You see it Eddie?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Whatever it is, it's workin'.
dialog: 47.
text: He winks at Jane as he stirs cookie batter. Jane blushes as
text: her cell phone rings.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hello.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: No! I didn't do this again!
scene_heading: 42 EXT. JANE'S OPEN FIELD - LATE DAY 42

scene_heading: REVERSE - ON JANE
text: Rushing toward Adam.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Adam, I'm so sorry. My mind is
dialog: just... Forgive me.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: If I were your shrink I'd say maybe
dialog: you don't really want to build this
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That's completely not true. I'm
dialog: really sorry.
dialog: (looks at taped off
dialog: addition)
dialog: Oh! I like it already!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yeah, it's feeling really good. So,
dialog: this becomes your office. We come
dialog: down your new hallway, the windows
dialog: are all along here...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Great. Love it.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: And from here to there...wait, let
dialog: me get the door for you...
dialog: (opens a piece of tape)
dialog: Your kitchen.
speaker_heading: (they ENTER)
dialog: We're in the eating area. How's
dialog: the size?
dialog: (pretends to sit)
text: We're at either end of the table.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (laughs at Adam)
dialog: Feels perfect.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I thought so too.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (taking it all in)
dialog: This is heaven!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's gonna be cool. Want to go
dialog: upstairs?
scene_heading: 43 JANE AND ADAM ATOP SIDE BY SIDE LADDERS 43
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: So if you were lying in bed, this
dialog: would be your view.
text: Jane breaks into a smile.
scene_heading: THEIR POV - IN THE DISTANCE -- THE OCEAN
text: Over this tranquil view -- A CELL RINGS. Jane takes her
text: phone out of her pocket, sees it's Jake calling. She pauses,
text: then pushes "IGNORE" and then promptly loses her balance.
text: Adam immediately reaches over and steadies her.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (grabs her heart)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: WATER RUNNING OUT OF A FAUCET
scene_heading: 44 INT. BATHROOM - JAKE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME 44
text: Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the
text: sink. Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting
text: away his cell. He quietly pushes the shower door open and
text: then carefully shuts it with a small snap. Jake fake coughs
text: and then turns off the sink water. He checks his watch when
text: he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness
text: calling his name in anger. He leaps.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Coming!
text: Jake quietly UNLOCKS THE BATHROOM DOOR and EXITS to find his
text: path is blocked by Pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: What were you doing in there?
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: Going to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: The toilet didn't flush.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes it did.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Why were you in the shower with
dialog: your clothes on?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (making sure Agness
dialog: doesn't hear)
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: I heard the shower door close.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What do you have, x-ray ears?
text: Agness joins in briefs and a white tank, black bra peeking
text: through. She holds a broom.
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: What's up Pedro?
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: Jake took a shower with his clothes
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Pedro! Darling...
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: What's he talking about?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't speak Pedro. That's your
dialog: department.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: (to Pedro)
dialog: Don't go in the kitchen, P, I broke
dialog: something.
dialog: (to Jake, annoyed)
dialog: Yo. Can you help?
text: Agness EXITS back to the kitchen as Pedro stares at Jake.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 45 TWO GORGEOUS CROQUE-MONSIEURS - COMING OUT OF AN OVEN 45
text: These open-faced fancy French Grilled Cheese Sandwiches are
dialog: carried to Jane's counter. We're:
scene_heading: INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING
text: Jane very professionally places the Croque-Monsieurs onto two
text: waiting plates, adds some salad on the side. Adam stands
text: nearby with a glass of wine, jacket off.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That looks amazing.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It's called a croque-monsieur. It's
dialog: one of the first things I learned
dialog: to make when I lived in Paris
dialog: because the ingredients are really
dialog: really cheap.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: When did you live in Paris?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: In my early twenties. I went there
dialog: to take a six day pastry class and
dialog: ended up staying a year working as
text: an apprentice in a bakery.
text: Jane places the plates AT THE ISLAND as she and Adam SIT SIDE
text: BY SIDE. Jane raises her wine glass.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thank you for taking my 47 e-mails
dialog: and turning them into something so
dialog: beautiful.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You are rapidly becoming one of the
dialog: most appreciative clients I've ever
dialog: had...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, I'm not all that used to
dialog: being able to count on anyone...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (surprised by that)
dialog: Really?
scene_heading: 46 JAKE DRIVING - SAME TIME 46
text: He squints, looking ahead, SEES:
scene_heading: JANE'S HOUSE - ALL LIT UP
text: And Adam's car parked out front. Jake turns OFF HIS
text: HEADLIGHTS, slowly pulling around to the side of the house.
scene_heading: 47 INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 47
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know it's none of my business
dialog: but... I'm trying to figure out why
dialog: someone like you is divorced.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: And what'd you come up with?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Something in the you're too nice
dialog: department..?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, that and my wife fell in love
dialog: with my best friend. Ex-best
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, no!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: We were all on a biking trip, he
dialog: and his wife, me and my
dialog: wife...through Tuscany and on the
dialog: last day of the trip they announced
dialog: they were in love.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That's awful.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yeah. Not a great plane ride home.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I can imagine, sitting there for
dialog: eleven hours with your wife who you
dialog: know is -- oh, that's rough.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Actually they went on to Venice and
dialog: I flew back with Carol, his wife.
dialog: You can't imagine what it's like to
dialog: sit next to someone who's been
text: crying for ten straight hours.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't blame her.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I was talking about me. Anyway,
dialog: they're married now and it's
dialog: pretty much an ongoing awful thing.
dialog: But, you and your ex... When I saw
text: him stop by for a cup of coffee the
dialog: other morning, I thought -- Wow!
dialog: That's the way it's supposed to be.
dialog: You two seem to have it all figured
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: We're not as figured out as you'd
dialog: think.
scene_heading: 48 EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME 48
text: Jake, in work-out clothes, sprints across the front lawn,

scene_heading: 49 BACK TO SCENE 49
text: Jane clears their dishes.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You know I hope you don't feel I've
dialog: been interrogating you, but...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: JANE(cont'd)
dialog: I know what it's like to have your
dialog: ex remarried and to not have so
text: much going on in that department.
dialog: I mean, do you date ever or...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Uh, constantly actually.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Constantly?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Everyone I know or have ever known
dialog: has fixed me up. And then,
dialog: sometimes I just meet women, I
dialog: don't know how that happens, but...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: -- But no girlfriend?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Not yet.
text: Jane stands ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND and hands Adam
text: another croque-monsieur. She stays on her side, like a
text: waitress at a counter. She refills his water glass.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Just like to date...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Actually, I find it really
dialog: stressful. You know, the last time
dialog: I was in the dating world was 1978.
dialog: It's a little more complicated
dialog: these days. I can't tell you how
dialog: nice it is to have a conversation
dialog: with a woman and have the pressure
dialog: off. Not to mention, a home cooked
dialog: meal that no one else I know could
dialog: possibly cook.
text: Jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that. She
text: smiles, wiping the counter.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That was a compliment. So you
dialog: don't have a guy in your life at
dialog: the moment?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No....
dialog: (starts to say something.)
dialog: No.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No?
scene_heading: EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: Jake rises from the bushes outside of Jane's Kitchen Window.
text: He PEEKS in the window, balancing himself precariously on a
text: stack of loose bricks. He sees Jane telling Adam a story and
text: both of them cracking up. Jake leans in further to try to
text: hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet,
text: he loses his balance and drops OUT OF THE FRAME.
scene_heading: 51 INT. JANE'S HOUSE - A BIT LATER 51
text: Jane walks Adam to the door. He holds rolled blueprints.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: This was so nice and relaxing and
dialog: the lavender ice cream was actually
dialog: the best dessert of any sort I've
dialog: ever had... like, in my life.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Aw, thank you. I always make ice
dialog: cream when I can't sleep, so I'm
dialog: glad someone was here to eat it.
dialog: (opens door)
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (pauses...)
dialog: Great getting to know you a little.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: It was really fun.
text: Adam waves, Jane waves. Definitely a little sweet/awkward.
text: Jane closes her door, starts turning out lights, heading for
text: the kitchen, when there's a QUICK KNOCK on the FRONT DOOR.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Woops! Coming!
text: Jane quickly returns to the door and opens it to find:
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: leaning in the door frame.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: O.M.G. I thought he'd never leave.
dialog: (entering)
dialog: Hello Jane, you look very beautiful
dialog: tonight.
text: He takes her in his arms.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Mmmmm. Love when you smell like
dialog: butter.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (easing away)
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Missed you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It's nine o'clock. Where does your
dialog: wife think you are?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: At yoga. Shall we do some
dialog: downward facing dog?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Not tonight big guy.
text: They CROSS INTO THE KITCHEN. CAMERA TRACKS.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Is it really necessary for you to
dialog: always say no before you say yes? I
dialog: won't think less of you, you know.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Really, Jake, I'm a little tired, I
dialog: was just gonna take a bath.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Good. So, we'll just hang out.
text: (now IN THE KITCHEN, he
dialog: SEES the dinner dishes on
dialog: the counter)
dialog: Ooooo, is that Croque-Monsieur?
dialog: Who's plate is this? Yours or his?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mine.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (eats her leftovers,
dialog: savors the taste)
dialog: Oh my God, just as I remember it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Don't you ever eat at your house?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Pedro dictates all meals and he has
text: a very limited palate.
dialog: (sees melted ice cream)
dialog: What kind of ice cream is that?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Lavender Honey.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (immediately)
dialog: Not sleeping?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Not at all. You?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Never slept better. And my
text: digestion is finally back on track.
dialog: You've turned my world right side
dialog: up, Jane. You know what this
dialog: means, don't you?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That I've never really known how to
dialog: live without you.
scene_heading: 52 INT. JANE'S BATHROOM 52
text: Jane takes a bubble bath. Jake lies on the floor, leaning
text: against the tub, his back to her, eating a bowl of ice cream.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Maybe we should be growing old
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hate to tell you, big guy, but we
dialog: already grew old apart.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What's with the `big guy'? Is that
dialog: because you think I'm fat or is it
dialog: a term of endearment?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I have no idea why I keep saying
dialog: that. I'm sorry. I'll stop.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I love how quiet it is in your
dialog: house. I have no quiet in my life.
dialog: Ever.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah, well, you live with a five
dialog: year old.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes...and don't forget Pedro.
text: Jane splashes him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So what does that mean exactly...?
dialog: What's going on over there at your
dialog: place?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: My marriage is... not turning out
dialog: as I hoped. That's obvious....
dialog: Agness started out really looking
dialog: up to me... We never used to fight
dialog: but now... with the kid....lately
dialog: we're all about where he's gonna go
dialog: to school and now she says we need
dialog: a bigger house, more help. I was
dialog: thinking of cutting back at work...
dialog: now that's never gonna happen. And
dialog: she wants another baby before Pedro
dialog: gets too old which I get but since
dialog: we're always fighting... oh, God,
dialog: listen to me.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Isn't a baby part of the deal when
dialog: you marry a woman that age?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Is it? I guess so. She's got me
dialog: booked at the fertility center
dialog: every other day and she's so amped
dialog: up on hormone injections I may need
dialog: to find an exorcist if she doesn't
dialog: calm down.
dialog: (Jane laughs)
dialog: I wish it was funny.

dialog: Incredible ice cream. I'm turning
dialog: around...
text: (as he turns, Jane shrinks
dialog: in the tub)
dialog: Remember when we used to smoke pot
dialog: and eat your ice cream in the hot
dialog: tub?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: The "hot tub"... That feels like a
dialog: billion years ago.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How long has it been since you...
dialog: (indicates smoking a
dialog: joint)
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Me? Since before Lauren was born.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: 27 years?!!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: At least.
text: Jake slips a joint out of his shirt pocket, twirls it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Are you kidding me? Put that away!
dialog: It's been too long...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm not going to....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Okay, why don't I leave this with

dialog: Maybe you'll take a few hits...
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: JAKE(cont'd)

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Maybe....
text: Jake places the joint in a drawer.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So that nerdy architect likes
dialog: you...you know that, right?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He's not nerdy and he definitely
dialog: doesn't. We're working together.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I was watching when you bent down
text: to open the oven, his eyes were
dialog: glued to your ass.
speaker_heading: JANE

scene_heading: 53 INT. FOYER 53
text: Jake is on a small ladder, changing a light bulb in the

speaker_heading: JAKE
text: (looking down at her,

dialog: Tell the truth, Janey is this a
dialog: great affair, or what?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't know. It's my first.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (climbing down)
dialog: We don't even have to have sex and
dialog: it's fun.
dialog: (arrives next to her)
dialog: I wish I could sleep over.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I gotta tell my shrink about this.
dialog: This is a lot to handle. I guess
dialog: you should go ... I'm sure yoga's
dialog: probably closed by now.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: JANE(cont'd)
dialog: Oh, you got a little ice cream on

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It's okay...

text: up her neck. Jane gives in and kisses Jake fully on the
text: lips. He pulls her close, her robe falling.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Wow, wow, wow...what's happening,
dialog: Jake?
text: The Phone RINGS. Jane pauses.
speaker_heading: JAKE

text: She hesitates, picks it

dialog: Hello. Hiii...

dialog: sounds like fun. Let me know what
dialog: I can bring..... No! Don't have
dialog: any idea where he is.
dialog: (points to Jake)
dialog: Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow.
dialog: (hangs up)

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: -- Just getting in my car. This
dialog: weekend? Sounds great. Let me
dialog: know what I can bring...
text: Jake looks to Jane. She shakes her head -- he's shameless.

scene_heading: 54 EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET - EARLY MORNING 54
text: Jane paces outside of a medical building, holding a box from

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (approaching him)
dialog: Dr. Allen!
speaker_heading: DR. ALLEN
dialog: (surprised to see her)
dialog: Jane. Hi. Am I seeing you today?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No, I just need to talk...and I was
dialog: wondering if there was any chance
dialog: you could squeeze me in for an
dialog: emergency session. I'm sort of
dialog: desperate for some advice. I
dialog: brought you some of that coffee
dialog: cake you like. Not as a bribe or
dialog: anything...
speaker_heading: DR. ALLEN
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: I only have twenty minutes until my

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That's fine. I'll talk fast.

text: Jane, Dr. Allen and the Dog walk the corridor.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: So, at this point, I just need some
dialog: sound, unbiased guidance. Is
dialog: having an affair with you know who
dialog: a good thing or a bad thing?
text: (they stop at Dr. Allen's
dialog: office door)
dialog: It's a bad thing, right? How could
dialog: it be good?
speaker_heading: DR. ALLEN
dialog: (opening his door)
dialog: It's not good. It's not bad.
dialog: Oh, man. Not what she needs to hear.
scene_heading: 56 INT. OFFICE 56
text: Jane sits in a chair across from an empty chair. Dr. Allen
text: turns on a few lamps as his dog settles.
speaker_heading: DR. ALLEN
dialog: You know, things happen in life and
dialog: our job is to find out why. What
dialog: we have to do is take a real look
dialog: at this. Are you ready to do that?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I am. Definitely. I've made a list
dialog: of what this can possibly be
dialog: about...at my end. Can I read it
dialog: to you?
speaker_heading: DR. ALLEN
dialog: (taking his seat)
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (digging out her
dialog: Blackberry)
dialog: Thanks. I e-mailed it to myself.
dialog: (reads from Blackberry)
dialog: Okay. Am I still trying to figure
dialog: out why the marriage failed? Do I
dialog: want to get back together? Do we
dialog: have unfinished business? Is this
dialog: about revenge? Am I just...
dialog: lonely? Or, is it my "caretaker"
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: JANE(cont'd)
dialog: You know, the kids are finally gone
text: and now all of a sudden Jake's back
dialog: and I get to take care of him in
dialog: some way...
text: Dr. Allen nods, impressed with the work she's done.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: And, listen, I get how therapy
dialog: works, I do... We look at things,
dialog: we examine them, weeks turn into
dialog: months, what....? we're going on
dialog: eight years, right?.... and I'm
dialog: okay with that, I like it... but in
dialog: this case, I need to know what you
dialog: really think. Like, I'd like you
dialog: to say... Don't do this, it's
dialog: absolutely wrong or go ahead,
dialog: you'll be fine. I actually want to
dialog: be told what to do.
speaker_heading: DR. ALLEN
dialog: What's interesting is I'm already
dialog: seeing you open up more than I have
dialog: in some time. I'm thinking,
dialog: through this affair, you may learn
dialog: to view the world in a different
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm sorry. I need more concrete.
dialog: Are you saying I should keep seeing
dialog: him? Because, honestly, if the
dialog: guilt and fear could go away, maybe
dialog: I could let go a little and figure
dialog: this out.
speaker_heading: DR. ALLEN
dialog: I wouldn't resist looking at this.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (mulls that over quickly)
dialog: Okay... and another way of saying
dialog: that is....?
speaker_heading: DR. ALLEN
dialog: Let go Jane. It can't hurt.

speaker_heading: HOTEL DOC

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JANE

dialog: Flomax?
speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: Yes, otherwise I pee 40 times a

speaker_heading: HOTEL DOC
dialog: How long have you been taking the
dialog: Flomax?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Not that long. And I only take it
dialog: sporadically. I have to sneak it
dialog: actually.
dialog: (explains confidentially)
dialog: It reduces semen and that's not
dialog: good for my wife right now.
dialog: (to Jane)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: HOTEL DOC
dialog: (looks over at Jane)
dialog: Really..?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes, I prefer a lot of semen.

dialog: (rises)
dialog: Okay, well, thank you so much for
dialog: coming. Looks like he's gonna live,
dialog: so...
speaker_heading: HOTEL DOC
dialog: (packing up)
dialog: Yeah, my guess is Flomax is
dialog: probably the culprit here. It can
dialog: definitely give you a sudden drop
dialog: in blood pressure so I suggest you
dialog: stay off it for a few weeks, which
dialog: apparently your wife will
dialog: appreciate.
dialog: (holds in a chuckle)
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah. Really good for me.

speaker_heading: HARLEY

speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Because I don't want to be one of

dialog: wasn't all your fault.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You mean that? You've never said
dialog: that to me before.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know. Because when you cheated,
dialog: I didn't have to. But I think in

dialog: not sure you ever really did.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I still haven't.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Two days ago you went to The

speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: Yes and guess what? We saw
dialog: nothing.
text: Jane and Harley connect. He immediately looks away.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: What is that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: Who wants wine? Anyone?
dialog: (starts pouring)
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: (looking in the fridge)
dialog: Mom, you have an insane amount of
dialog: food in here, even for you.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (taking out last night's

dialog: I knew you were all going to be

speaker_heading: LAUREN

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: Very.
text: Jane looks to Harley again when they all hear a car horn
text: HONK. Jane LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and sees JAKE'S PORSCHE PULL
text: UP with Luke in the passenger seat. The Girls rush out the

text: pours himself a larger glass of wine as Jane approaches him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Harley?
text: Just then, Luke enters and Jane lights up.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yay!!!!

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (surveying all the food)

speaker_heading: JANE

text: He sees last night's dinner, now being served as left overs.
text: Jane slices the roast chicken.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That looks incredible.
text: Jane looks up at him, knife poised. Is he kidding?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thanks.
text: She goes at the chicken with the knife, slicing off a leg.
text: Jake flinches.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: Jake? Glass of wine?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Uh, sure. Thanks.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: Jane?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (not looking up)

text: Jake's cell RINGS. He turns his back to take it.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (into cell)

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (into cell)
dialog: Okay, I will. Yeah, no, I know.
dialog: (turns back to the family)
dialog: I'm sorry guys, I gotta hit it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Bye-bye.
text: The Girls look to Jane.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I have to stop at the market.
dialog: Agness is making some pasta thing
dialog: and she ran out of olive oil.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Hey, at least she's finally
dialog: cooking.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So...see everybody at the party
dialog: tomorrow...
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Yeah. It's gonna be so fun.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (to Lauren)
dialog: I told you I'm bringing someone,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: No. Who?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Adam. My architect.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You're bringing your architect?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes I am.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Like as a date?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (looking right at him)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: I like the idea.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: Yeah, seems like it should round
dialog: out everything really nicely.
dialog: (pouring another drink)
dialog: Nobody wants wine but me?
dialog: 80.
text: Luke opens a cupboard, takes out a bottle of olive oil, hands
dialog: it to Jake.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Here, now you can stay another five

dialog: (catches Jane's eye)
dialog: You have three bottles in there.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Janey, can I talk to you privately?
dialog: Just for a sec.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What is it, Jake? What?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't get not calling me back.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: `Cause I don't care what your
dialog: excuse is.
dialog: (shuts the door to the
dialog: living )
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: She didn't go out, Jane. She
dialog: cancelled her plans and every
dialog: time I tried to call or write, she
dialog: caught me. I wanted to be here.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You know what, Jake? You were
dialog: worried about rocking the boat at
dialog: home? Well now you're rocking my
dialog: boat and I don't like it.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (stopping her)
dialog: Honey, don't let one night...
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You don't understand. I'm not even
dialog: blaming you. I fully participated
dialog: in this. But I don't want to do it
dialog: anymore. The last thing in the
dialog: world I should be right now is your
text: mistress, sitting around at nine at
text: night wearing heels and perfume and
text: blowing out candles and wrapping
dialog: everything in Saran Wrap because
dialog: your wife cancelled her plans. It
dialog: was cliche and humiliating.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (wistfully)
dialog: You lit candles?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, shut up. Look, I've had a
dialog: pretty good life these past 10
dialog: years. I figured it out and I
dialog: moved on. I no longer feel alone
dialog: or divorced. I just feel normal.
dialog: You know how long that took, just
dialog: to get my balance back?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: The point is, I'm going in the
dialog: wrong direction here. But the
dialog: worst part is... It's feeling like
dialog: it used to feel. All the little
dialog: untruths that are hard to catch but
dialog: add up...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: -- Janey, c'mon, it was one
dialog: mistake...
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: (joining them)
dialog: -- Everything okay out here?
dialog: (Jane and Jake turn)
dialog: The kids are gettin' hungry...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah. We're done.
text: (walks away, pauses in
dialog: front of Harley)
dialog: We were just...
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: (as she passes)
dialog: -- None of my beeswax, Jane.
dialog: (once she's gone)
dialog: And please never tell me.
text: Lauren joins.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Nothin', punky.
dialog: (rubs her arm)
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: (taking Jake back inside)
dialog: Yeah? So, we're going to see you
dialog: tomorrow night, for sure, right?
text: Harley starts to follow them out when Jane grabs his shirt
dialog: sleeve.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Okay...What did you see and what do
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: Nothing. Really.
text: Jane gives him a look that could get blood from a stone.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: (confesses rapidly)
dialog: Okay, he checked in, you arrived,
dialog: you met in the elevator, possible
dialog: kiss there, Doctor went up, Doctor
dialog: came down, thumbs up. That's it.
dialog: Have no idea what happened in
dialog: between.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (dying...)
dialog: Have you told Lauren?
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: No and I won't --
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (joining them)

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE
text: Jane and Harley ENTER from the courtyard just as Jake is

text: Lauren kisses Jake good-bye on the cheek then joins the
text: others who are about to sit down for dinner.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (from the Dining Room)
dialog: Thanks for picking me up, Dad...
text: Jake pauses awkwardly at the door. He can't catch Jane's
text: eye. He waves to the kids, who don't seem to notice then
text: heads out.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE
text: Jake EXITS, turns back, looks INSIDE THE DINING ROOM, sees
text: his family sitting around the table, talking, laughing. He
text: heads toward his car as...
speaker_heading: JANE
text: glances out the window at Jake as he drives off. One of the
text: kids says something, distracting her, and she laughs...

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm feelin' a little fantastic.

dialog: a gi-normous piece of cake.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (trying not to react to
text: that, ENTERS, handing her
dialog: the gift.)
dialog: This is for you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Really? Thank you! Come on in.
text: (takes a huge bite of
dialog: cake)
dialog: Can you hold this for a sec?
dialog: (hands him the cake plate)
dialog: Oh my God...
dialog: (takes another bite)
dialog: -- this could be the best cake I
dialog: ever made. You want a piece? It's
dialog: like... beyond...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I think I'm good.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (focusing on the gift)
dialog: I can't believe you brought me a
dialog: gift?! So nice!
dialog: 85.
text: Jane unwraps the gift, turns it around, looks at it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: An appointment book?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I sort of assumed you didn't have
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: --Because I never remember our...
dialog: Awww....
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I took the liberty of filling in
dialog: our next two meetings. And marked
dialog: them with post-its and wrote them
text: in red and then highlighted them in
text: neon yellow.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thank you!
text: Jane kisses Adam on the cheek just as he was moving and the
text: kiss lands on his lips.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm not.
dialog: (Did he really say that?
text: Then, he licks his lips)
dialog: Wow, that cake is good.
text: Jane laughs a little too hard.
scene_heading: 83 INT. ADAM'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 83
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So, let me ask you something and
dialog: please don't think I'm weird or out
dialog: of line or anything... but do you
dialog: by any chance poke smot?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Do I...??
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I mean do you smoke pot?! I
dialog: haven't asked anyone that question
dialog: since I was twenty-two.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Uh. No, I don't. But I have. But
dialog: I don't think I've had any since my
dialog: kids were born...so not in like 27
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh my God, we have kids the same
dialog: age! And I haven't had any since
dialog: my kids were born either!!! Except
dialog: for tonight. I had one hit off of
dialog: this.
text: Jane pulls the joint out of her purse, just as they pull up
text: next to a Police Car.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You might not want to hold that
dialog: quite so...
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Hello Officer.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (turns, SEES the Cop Car,
speaker_heading: GASPS and DROPS THE

dialog: waves, then:)
dialog: I actually know him! Blueberry
text: scone and a latte.
text: (the Cop nods, pulls away)
dialog: Oh my God! That was horrifying. I
dialog: instantly saw myself in a mug shot.
dialog: My heart is leaping out of my...
dialog: (then distracted)
dialog: Wow... This is the most insane
dialog: dashboard I've ever seen. It's like
dialog: we're in a cockpit. It's
dialog: spectacular. Adam, what kind of
dialog: car is this?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Jane?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (turns to him)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: JANE

dialog: Don't take too much, it's really
dialog: strong.
text: She blows out the smoke. Adam, on the other hand, takes a
dialog: huge hit.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (while holding in the
dialog: smoke)
dialog: I haven't had fun in almost three
dialog: years, Jane.
dialog: (takes another huge hit)
dialog: Bring. It. On.
speaker_heading: SOME COLLEGE KIDS

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: ADAM(cont'd)
dialog: Hey, there's your ex-husb-- Uh-Oh.

text: (dances again when he sees
dialog: Jake in SLOW-MO getting
dialog: closer and closer)
dialog: Oooo. Why so intense, big fella?
text: Adam slides a bit behind Jane as Jake arrives with Agness who

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hello Jane.... Adam.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (all smiles)
dialog: Hey, good to see you again.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Adam, this is Agness, Jake's
dialog: wife...
dialog: (suddenly realizing)
dialog: Now that is an odd sentence for me
dialog: to say since that was me for most
dialog: of my life. Seriously. How weird
dialog: is that? Both of us married to the
dialog: same man!
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: (dismissing the idea)
dialog: You know... it's... hey, what are
dialog: you gonna do?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah, why go there.
text: At this point, Adam gets hit with a severe case of the
text: giggles. As the rest continue, he can't keep a straight
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Because there, is...fascinating. I
dialog: mean, when you think about it, it
dialog: sort of links us in some cosmic
dialog: crazy way, doesn't it, Agness? Of
dialog: all the men on the planet, we both
dialog: said "I do" to this guy.
speaker_heading: AGNESS
dialog: Yeah. Twenty-five years apart. I
dialog: know you're having like an "Ah-Ha'

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What?! You smoked the joint I gave
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You told me to! It's a-mazing!!!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But you weren't supposed to smoke

dialog: smoke it with me!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Somebody's jealous....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes, of course. Why shouldn't I
dialog: be... you're my...
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You're my ex-wife, lover, oldest

text: Jane blurts out a laugh.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Okay. You're hilarious. And
dialog: because of that, even though I kind
dialog: of hate you/love you, I'm going to
dialog: let you have some...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You love me? I mean, I heard "hate"
dialog: had top billing, but...
text: Jane takes the joint out of her purse, lights it up and hands
text: it to Jake. Just as she does that, THE DOOR OPENS and HARLEY
text: ENTERS, thinking the bathroom is free. Jake quickly yanks
text: him in, shuts the door, locks it. Harley is now caught
text: between Jane and Jake and a cloud of smoke.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: Oh my God, you're smoking weed in
dialog: the guest bathroom.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes we are and we'd appreciate it
dialog: if you didn't tell anyone about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: No. Never. Adding it to the list.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Care for a toke?
speaker_heading: HARLEY

dialog: didn't say, "a lot".
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: But I was thinking it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So... I'm not too old for you?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: How can you be too old for me when
dialog: I'm older than you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I just figured all these women you
dialog: get fixed up with are thirty-five.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Your age is one of my favorite
dialog: things about you.
dialog: (she appreciates that)
dialog: Do you think you have any more of

scene_heading: INT. BAKERY KITCHEN
text: JANE FLOURS AND ROLLS CROISSANT DOUGH as Adam, now in an

scene_heading: ANGLE - JANE AND ADAM - TWO STONERS
text: watching the sheeter, mesmerized.
text: NEXT Jane folds the flattened dough, measures it with a yard
text: stick, then cuts it into sections. She takes one of the
text: sections, spreads it on a marble slab and very quickly cuts
dialog: it into triangles. She's a whiz at this.
text: THEN, Jane shows Adam how to stretch the triangles of
text: dough.... Nervous at first, he gets the hang of it. Then,
text: Jane teaches Adam how to place a bar of chocolate in each

dialog: `Cause I'm not strong enough to

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I understand. I wouldn't say it
dialog: was over if it wasn't.

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Great.

text: quizzically.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (explains)
dialog: Cooking scar.... From a very hot
dialog: batch of caramel...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Ooooo. What about that one?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That one's from boiling sugar...I
dialog: wasn't very skilled in the
dialog: beginning. And that one is from a
dialog: large French...
text: Adam presses Jane's palm to his lips and kisses her scar.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: -- Saute pan.
text: Adam then kisses the burn on her forearm. Jane sighs, closes
text: her eyes. This feeling is unexpected. She opens her eyes as
text: Adam moves closer.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Would it be okay if I...?
text: Jane nods. He kisses her great.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I was going to say, kiss you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I figured.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: If you feel this is in any way
dialog: wrong because we're working
dialog: together...
speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: LUKE

speaker_heading: LAUREN

scene_heading: 96 EXT. FRONT PORCH 96
text: Jane EXITS as Jake steps out of his car. He looks like he's

text: cautiously looks back at the house. The kitchen windows are
dialog: all open.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Everything okay?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I left Agness.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No, don't say that.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: She saw it my eyes, Janey.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Saw what?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That I'm still in love with you. I
dialog: admitted it, I told her about us
dialog: and I've left her. For you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No, no, no.... What do you mean???
dialog: Jake, this is crazy!
dialog: (worried the kids will
dialog: hear, whispers)
dialog: Are you telling me the truth?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: This feels so right Jane.
text: As Jane is about to respond, Gabby EXITS the house in her
text: PJ's, looking confused.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: (from the porch)
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Nothing. Honey, set the table,
dialog: I'll be right in.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Mom, you're the only one who cares
dialog: if the table's set.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Okay, then do it for me....just go
dialog: in please.
text: Luke and Lauren join Gabby on the porch.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What's up, Dad?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Having some problems on the home
dialog: front, just wanted to talk to your
dialog: Mom for a sec.
text: Jane shakes her head. Why did he have to say that? Harley
dialog: joins the Kids.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Problems on the home front? Is one
dialog: of you seeing someone else?
text: Hearing that, Harley does a swift about face and goes right
text: back inside. Jane's eyes widen toward Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (off Jane's cue)
dialog: No, it's nothing like that. I just
dialog: need to find a hotel or something
dialog: for a few days `til I get my head
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: It's that serious?
text: Jake nods.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Mom, can Dad stay here for a few
dialog: days? He can share my room.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't think that's the best idea,
dialog: Luke.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Daddy, are you crying?
dialog: 100.
scene_heading: 93 ON JAKE - TEARS WELLING UP 93

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Thank you for saving me Janey.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Jake, you knew the kids were all
dialog: here. Shouldn't we have talked
dialog: about this? Agreed this was the
dialog: right thing to do? This is so
dialog: typical. Only thinking about works
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm sorry, I guess I should've
dialog: called before showing up.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: -- And I'm not sure you even left
dialog: Agness. Maybe she saw something
dialog: last night and threw you out...
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What's the difference? I was
dialog: drowning over there. I'm not going
dialog: to get that many more chances in my
dialog: life to figure myself out. Janey,
dialog: let's use these couple of days to
dialog: see if we can make this work.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: We can't, Jake. I told you this
dialog: the other night. Please listen.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But you were all pissy because you
dialog: thought I stood you up. Things are
dialog: different now. I'm a free man.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Can we just hug? I hate that
dialog: you're being so distant. It's
dialog: literally giving me a pain in my
dialog: stomach.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh, God...
text: Jane reluctantly hugs him. He tries to kiss her.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: See! Too much!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Okay! Good note.
text: Jane can't help but smile.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Can I help with what you're doing?
dialog: Hold your basket or...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm fine....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Okay... I'm going to go to the
dialog: video store and get us all a dvd to
dialog: watch tonight. We'll have movie
dialog: night. Just like old times. How's
dialog: that? I'll make the popcorn.
text: Just then Jane's Cell RINGS.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Fine.

dialog: Hello...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: I love knowing I'm coming back

speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Are you kidding?
text: (takes out an armful of
dialog: Tupperware)
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Any of that noodle thing left?
dialog: (Gabby hands it to him.)
dialog: Where's Mom? She disappeared so

speaker_heading: GABBY
text: She's probably sleeping.
speaker_heading: LUKE

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Tonight was weird.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: So weird. Still is.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I loved tonight.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Yeah. That's why it was so weird.
dialog: Just seeing you in your robe in our
dialog: kitchen. Remember when you weren't
dialog: even allowed in. Mom used to go out
dialog: to the car to talk to you...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (handing Gabby his
dialog: Tupperware)
dialog: You know, I don't even really
dialog: remember you and Mom as a couple.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What do you mean... you were ten
dialog: when we broke up.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I was eight actually and I don't
dialog: know...it's all foggy to me now.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You don't remember us in Hawaii or
dialog: all sleeping in that tent in the
dialog: backyard.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, of course, but I don't
dialog: remember like you and Mom hugging
dialog: or waking up together...
text: Jake grabs his heart, moans.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: -- It's okay. I'm not damaged or
dialog: anything. You've been good
dialog: parents...
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Speak for yourself dude. I'm
dialog: definitely damaged from the
dialog: divorce.
text: Harley and Lauren ENTER. Lauren turns the tea kettle on.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Hello troops.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why are you still here?
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: I don't know, you and Mom sleeping
dialog: in the same house. Harley thought
dialog: we should stay.
text: Jake turns his beams on Harley.
speaker_heading: HARLEY
dialog: She exaggerates. I just thought
dialog: perhaps you might want to talk
dialog: later, or ... Is that the noodle
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh. Sorry. I think I ate it all.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: ADAM

text: Gray sweater. Very old.
speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Keep it. It's cozy. Boy, you have

speaker_heading: ADAM

text: HIS ROBE, and lies on his side, on the bed, completely NUDE --
text: elbow up, palm supporting his head -- a smile on his face. He
text: changes his smile to a smoulder.
text: Jake hears water running. Suddenly modest, he quickly drags

speaker_heading: JAKE
text: (sits up straight, the lap

dialog: Why do you think?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Okay, I'm gonna be sick.
text: Jake LEANS IN, covers Adam's eyes on the screen, which, of
dialog: course, does nothing.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Not working! Big close up!

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Everybody okay?
text: No one says anything.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: What's happening?
text: Adam listens, his eyes on Jane. Jake crosses to Jane, facing
text: the Kids. He walks in and out of the iSight shot.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Okay. Let me explain. The reason I
dialog: left Agness wasn't just because my
dialog: marriage wasn't working.
dialog: (The Kids wait...)
dialog: I've also fallen in love...back in
dialog: love... with your mother. Or maybe
dialog: I never stopped loving her.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Is this a joke?
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I know this is shocking, but I
dialog: think this is the best thing that's
dialog: ever happened to me. Your Mom and
dialog: I have been seeing each other, on
dialog: the side... ever since New York.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Mom, is this true?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (dying)
dialog: That part is, but..
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I found my way back home. I just
dialog: hope she'll take me back.
text: Gabby breaks down in tears. Lauren puts her arm around her.
text: Jane starts to cry, looks at her laptop, just as she HEARS A

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why's everyone crying? Why isn't
dialog: this good news?
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: Because we're still getting over

speaker_heading: LUKE

scene_heading: 124 A FRONT DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL HARLEY 124

text: Jane stands in the doorway. The Kids don't say a word. Jane
text: doesn't wait. She crosses to the bed, sits on it, looks at
dialog: her children.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Knowing how to be divorced is next
dialog: to impossible... and sometimes over
dialog: the years, I've thought that your
dialog: Dad and I weren't quite finished.
dialog: And, as it turns out, we weren't.
dialog: So I went out of my comfort zone,
dialog: which, I found out, if you're
dialog: really honest with yourself, isn't
dialog: all that comforting. So, I
dialog: experimented with a part of myself.
dialog: I wanted to find out if, after all
dialog: these years there was still
dialog: something there between us.
speaker_heading: LAUREN
dialog: And was there?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: There kinda was.
text: Lauren smiles with her eyes.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: But Mom, you have to understand how
dialog: bonkers this sounds to us. For two
dialog: people who for years couldn't be in
dialog: the same room together...to then
dialog: have an affair??? You and Dad...!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know...it was hard for me and I
dialog: was doing it. I hope you'll
dialog: forgive me for confusing you or
dialog: betraying your trust, but I did
dialog: this for me and for him and I
dialog: realized even though your Dad and I
dialog: once had something extraordinary...
dialog: we no longer really fit together.
dialog: But he is a part of me and always
dialog: will be.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: So it's over now? You guys are
dialog: back to being divorced.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: For better or for worse.

dialog: (rises)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hi. May I come in?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: -- Sure.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I didn't call you last night
dialog: because I wasn't sure you would
dialog: take the call and then I thought
dialog: that could go on for months and...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: -- I would have taken the call.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh. Well, anyway, it's better to
dialog: say these things in person. Adam,
dialog: the man I was seeing was...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I think I'm up to speed on that
dialog: part.
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I want you to know it didn't last
dialog: long and you're divorced, so maybe
dialog: you understand, when marriages end,
dialog: there's doubts and hurt, and you've
dialog: got kids and sometimes you wonder
dialog: if you did the right thing and when
dialog: the moment presented itself...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: -- I get it. I could imagine it...I
dialog: could...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I told him it wasn't going to work
dialog: between us but I guess he didn't
dialog: believe me and unbeknownst to me,
dialog: he showed up at my house yesterday.
dialog: He left Agness and...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: -- Jane. I actually think I
dialog: understand what happened
dialog: but...uh...you know I'm not as
dialog: macho as I appear and I think it's
dialog: probably best for us not to get any
dialog: more... involved because your
dialog: relationship with Jake isn't really
dialog: done and I know you're saying it
dialog: is, but he's in love with you and
dialog: for everyone's sake, that should
dialog: probably get resolved.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Wow. So that's how grown ups talk.
text: Adam smiles.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Please tell me you're not going to
dialog: quit my job and ask Peter to take
dialog: over because then I'll never get to
dialog: see you and...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I was thinking of asking Peter to
dialog: step back in.

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm sorry.

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How far back do you need it to go?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Way back.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Consider it an all inclusive

dialog: that move?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That you'd find me irresistible.
text: Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Never considered the alternative.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Gotta love that about you.
text: They swing some more.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh, man, can't believe I got up to
dialog: bat again and blew it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You didn't blow it. We blew it.
dialog: We blew it the first time around.
dialog: This time... we just should've
dialog: known better. Too much has
text: happened. Too much time has passed.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And you don't think we could make
dialog: it right?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Does that mean you didn't feel it
dialog: was totally right either?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Being with you Jane is the best I'm
dialog: gonna be.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: But do you agree that it wasn't
dialog: really...?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It was complicated.
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Begging for an answer.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I thought it was good. I wanted it
dialog: to be good.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Guess that's as close as I'm gonna
dialog: get.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Do you always have to be so hard on
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No. I don't.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't regret giving it another
dialog: shot.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Probably would've been better if
dialog: you hadn't been married.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It may never have happened if I
dialog: wasn't married.
text: Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is. They sit, side
text: by side, as they sway in the breeze.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't regret it either.
text: They continue rocking, not much more to say. As CAMERA PULLS
dialog: AWAY, we:
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 130 EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - MANY MORNINGS LATER 130
text: It's raining. Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber
text: is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps.
text: Jane EXITS THE HOUSE in a parka and under an umbrella. A
text: GROUP OF CONSTRUCTION GUYS ARE huddled under a make-shift
text: tarp. Jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to
text: face her she spots Adam, holding blue prints. Jane is
text: stunned he's there.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Did you know it's good luck to
dialog: start building in the rain?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (obviously lying)
dialog: Yes. It's a well known, very good,
dialog: really lucky omen.
text: Thunder rattles the sky.
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Good, I could use one.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Would you all like to have your
dialog: meeting in the house...it's dry and
dialog: I've got hot coffee...
text: The Group thanks her and heads for the house. Adam stays
text: back and walks next to Jane. It's a long second before
text: someone talks.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Jane, I need to ask you
dialog: something...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Anything...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You wouldn't happen to have any of
dialog: those amazing chocolate croissants,
dialog: would you?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh.... you like those, huh?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I have incredibly fond memories of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don't have any here, but we could
dialog: go into town and get some... right
text: out of the oven.
text: They turn toward the house and on their backs we hear:
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You want to do that?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yeah... love to.
text: And as they walk away from Camera, we:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SLOWLY FADE OUT
dialog:
