text: CLOSEUP: A slender woman's hand writes on a chalkboard,
text: in teacherly cursive.
dialog: 
text: We PULL BACK to REVEAL STARLA GRANT, a stunningly beautiful
text: Southern woman in her twenties, as she finishes writing
text: out, "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST"
dialog: 
text: Starla glances at the classroom of high school students.
text: She is a demure woman, somewhat awkward in her speaking,
text: but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the
dialog: class.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: When Darwin said 'fittest,' he
dialog: didn't necessarily mean the
dialog: strongest or the most intelligent,
dialog: or any one trait -- he merely meant
dialog: those organisms most well-suited
dialog: to their environment.
dialog: 
text: The boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks.
text: KYLIE STRUTEMYER, a pretty student, notices a BOY beside
text: her drawing Starla, only without her clothes. She hits
text: him. He CHUCKLES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: We humans think we're more fit,
dialog: more evolved, because we're smarter.
dialog: But we're neophytes. We've been
dialog: around two million years, give or
dialog: take. The cockroach has been here
dialog: for 350 million. You tell me who's
dialog: the more successful species.

dialog: 
text: Celebratory banners are strung over this street, including
text: one that reads: "DEER SEASON STARTS TODAY!" We're in the
text: center of Wheelsy, South Carolina, a moderately depressed
dialog: small town. Today's a big day, as HUNTERS from far and
text: near crowd the streets in their massive pickups.
dialog: 
text: MEN spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of
text: ammunition. OLD HUNTERS with faces like prunes stand
text: outside Angell's Tavern getting drunk. A MAN WITH FEW
text: TEETH has a dead deer strung out across the back of his
text: truck, skinning the carcass, its innards spilling loose.
dialog: 
text: JACK, an older, uptight man in fancy clothes, is driving
text: through town in his big old Cadillac. He comes upon a

dialog: 
text: GRANT GRANT, a large, indelicate man in his mid forties,
text: notices the photos on his desk moving. He looks up from
text: his desk and out his door, where there's a GLASS WORKSHOP.
text: Two WORKERS are carrying a large pane of glass, looking

speaker_heading: WAITRESS

scene_heading: INT. DINER KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Right.

speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: So we thought we best call in.
dialog:

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Come on now, honey, door's this

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It's open season. Let's shoot

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: She's just scared, Margaret.

dialog: 5.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Also, Bill likes to take a female
dialog: through the back door any chance
dialog: he gets.
dialog: 
text: Wally and Margaret LAUGH. Trevor snatches a dish-towel
text: and rushes the doe, using it like a cape. The scared doe
text: leaps away from him, jumping onto the kitchen counter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: She ain't a bull, Trevor!
dialog: 
text: The animal kicks off a pot, which hits Margaret.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Goddamn bambi-rat!
dialog: 
text: As the doe jumps to the floor, she gets her hoof wrapped
text: in a telephone cord.
dialog: 
text: The cord is plugged into the wall, trapping the doe in
text: place. Wally, Margaret, and Trevor attempt to dive for
text: the cord, but can't avoid the doe's crazy, flying hooves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Get back.
dialog: 
text: The other cops step away. Bill steps slowly toward the
text: doe, speaking calmly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: It's okay, sweetheart. Nobody's
dialog: gonna hurt you.
dialog: 
text: The doe looks at him, settling a bit. His voice seems to
text: be soothing her. Bill gets closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That's right. Just gonna pull
dialog: this cord out. It's gonna be all
dialog: right.
dialog: 
text: The cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe,
text: breathing heavily, becomes still. Bill scoops close past
text: her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall.
dialog: 
text: Bill smiles. Then the doe runs forward, almost knocking
text: Bill over, and streaks out the back door.
dialog: 
text: Bill, Wally, Margaret, and Trevor move up to the doorway
text: and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond,
text: dragging the telephone, tied to her leg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Hell, she took a phone. Now them

speaker_heading: GRANT

speaker_heading: STARLA

scene_heading: INT. GRANT MASTER BATHROOM - LATER
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT (O.S.)
dialog: Sugarplum, you coming into bed?
dialog: 
text: Starla turns toward the door. She doesn't say anything
dialog: for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
text: Just a second.
dialog: 
text: Starla sets her brush down on the counter. She arranges
text: it neatly beside the others. And walks into the bedroom.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Grant turns off the TV as Starla gets into bed with him.
text: It's almost completely dark in here.

dialog: grace.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Flip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: That's disrespectful.
dialog: 
text: Grant, peeved, gets off of her. He sits on the edge of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: When are you in the mood, exactly?
dialog: Seems to me that mood's as rare as

speaker_heading: GRANT

dialog: 
text: Grant notices a woman with a lot of makeup -- BRENDA
text: GUTIERREZ -- staring at him from across the bar, smoking
text: a cigarette. Grant stares at her, trying to figure out
text: who she is. She slides off her stool.
dialog: 
text: She sashays toward him. She props herself on the stool

speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Where you goin'?

dialog: Grant speaks more loudly than need be:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Starla, she gets real worried 'bout

dialog: too much, that one.
dialog: 
text: He glances around to see if people have heard, and stumbles
dialog: out.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SHADED CREEK - LATER
dialog: 
text: Grant sits on a boulder beside a creek, looking miserable,
text: downing a six pack.
dialog: 
text: He throws an empty can into the creek, when he glances
text: down and sees particles flowing down the river.
dialog: 
text: Grant slides off the boulder. He kneels and examines the
text: particles. They shimmer in the moonbeams coming down
text: between the trees.
dialog: 
text: Grant peers up the creek from where the particles are
dialog: coming.
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
text: He sees a gap on the edge of the creek, where water
text: splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill.
dialog: 
text: He approaches the spot, and comes upon a small crater on
text: the side of the creek. The meteorite is inside the crater,
text: but it's cracked into pieces. The rock seems almost
text: organic, like a shell. The shimmery specks are part of
text: the shell itself, flecking off into the creek and rushing
dialog: downstream.
dialog: 
text: Grant crouches. He touches the meteorite, and feels some
text: sort of goo inside it. It's sticky.
dialog: 
text: He notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the
text: crater itself and into the woods.
dialog: 
text: Grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail.
dialog: 
text: He comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. Something
text: is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. He moves in
dialog: closer.
dialog: 
text: A gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between
text: the flowers. The organism is a mound a few inches high,
text: gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around
text: it. A small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts
dialog: and expands lightly. I guess it's not worth keeping secret
text: that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: What the...?
dialog: 
text: Grant is a little freaked-out by this thing, even
text: frightened. He looks around for someone else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Hey, anybody 'round here? 'Lo?
dialog: 
text: No one answers. Grant looks down at the organism, unsure.
text: He picks up a tree branch.
dialog: 
text: Grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of
dialog: the branch.
dialog: 
dialog: Nothing happens.
dialog: 
text: He does it again. The thing pulses a little, and surges
dialog: toward Grant.
dialog: 
text: Grand pokes it again.
dialog: 
text: A small, thin quill -- a SPORE -- emerges from the cavity
text: in the center of the organism. The spore is quivering
text: and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as
dialog: well.
dialog: 
text: Grant slowly bends down to look at it when --
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
text: The SPORE suddenly SHOOTS OUT. It strikes Grant in the
dialog: stomach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Ow! Fuck!
dialog: 
text: Grant yanks up his shirt, looking at a wound on his
text: abdomen. He watches as the spore quivers and disappears
text: inside him.
dialog: 
text: He clutches his stomach, SCREAMS in agony. He falls back
text: into the colorful flowers. His body convulses.

text: We see the insides of Grant's body, as if sliced in half.
text: We ZOOM IN on the little spore, which is jittering up
text: through his body, and into his neck.
dialog: 
text: The spore keys into the base of Grant's cerebellum, and
text: his entire brain crackles with a WHITE ELECTRICAL ENERGY.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: 
text: Grant freezes in place, his fingers contorted up in front
text: of him, silent. He's utterly still, a wax corpse.

text: YELPS and jumps back. Grant sweats and heaves, trying to
dialog: speak, but hardly can --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: It's taking... my... brain.
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMPER
dialog: Buddy?
dialog: 
text: Grant's eyes glaze over, and he eases off. He heaves
text: there, momentarily confused. His eyes dart around, as if
text: seeing his surroundings for the first time. Grant stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMPER
dialog: You all right, man?
dialog: 
text: Grant looks down curiously at the camper. Then he turns
text: and stumbles away from them, out of the forest.

dialog: 
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
text: He pulls on his face a little, his eyes brimming with
text: excitement. He smiles at himself.
dialog: 
text: Grant looks toward the open bathroom door, where he hears
text: the running shower. He creeps toward it.
dialog: 
text: Grant peeks around the doorway. Starla is in the shower,

scene_heading: INT. GRANT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Haven't heard this for a while.
dialog: 
text: Grant walks toward her. He takes her hand in his own,

text: a bit hesitantly, a bit shy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: I never danced in a towel before.

text: Starla and Grant kiss, tenderly.
dialog: 
text: Grant falls to his knees in front of her. He runs his
text: hand over the curve of her hip, her thigh, her buttock,
text: with as much fascination as lust. He pushes Starla back
text: onto the bed.
dialog: 
text: He lifts her leg, and kisses it, nibbles on it a little,
text: scrapes his teeth on it. Starla is surprised by this,
text: but enjoys it too: it's probably the most foreplay she's
dialog: had in years.
dialog: 
text: Grant crawls on top of her, runs his hands over her
text: breasts, her face. Starla's hand moves over Grant's back,
text: and to his stomach. When she stops, startled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant, what's that?
dialog: 
text: She gazes down at the wound between them, on Grant's bare
text: abdomen, where the spore entered him. The wound is
text: yellowish, and surrounded by veins.
dialog: 
text: Grant, embarrassed, pulls his shirt down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Just a little bug bite is all.

scene_heading: INT. GRANT BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Grant is holding up his shirt, and looking at his torso.
text: The wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous, and is
text: starting to puff up into a veiny little spout. A fuzzy
text: bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout.
text: A pus oozes out.
dialog: 
text: Grant looks concerned. He squirts some Neosporin onto

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Grant opens the refrigerator door and rummages around
text: inside. He pulls out some bread. Some cheese.
dialog: 
text: He opens the meat drawer. It's replete with cold cuts.
text: He pulls out some Oscar Mayer baloney. Turkey. Pastrami
text: and salami. He grabs every type of meat there is.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Grant assembles a sandwich at the table. Two pieces of

text: But he can't stop, piling more and more on until he has a
dialog: little sandwich tower.
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
text: He looks at it. Something seems off about it. He removes
dialog: the cheese. Better. And then the bread. Even better.
text: He stares at what is now simply a tower of cold cuts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Meat.
dialog: 
text: After contemplating it for a moment, Grant stands and

scene_heading: INT. GRANT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Grant enters the garage through a door from the FOYER.
text: He flips the lights on with his shoulder. He looks around.
dialog: 
text: Grant spots an old file cabinet. He sets the tower of
text: meat down on the oily floor and opens a drawer. It's
text: filled with files. He closes that drawer, and opens
text: another. It has manila file folders, but no files.
dialog: 
text: Grant takes out the folders. He uses a Sharpie to write
text: out "BALONEY" on a folder. Then he stuffs all the baloney
text: into the folder and files it away.
dialog: 
text: He starts writing out "PASTRAMI".
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: You're meat.
dialog: 
text: The rat moves away from Grant. But Grant snaps out his

dialog: to get free.
dialog: 
text: Grant snaps its neck, and tosses the dead rat onto the

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Starla enters the house. She heads toward a door along

speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: All right... I have to clean up

dialog:

text: his leering gaze gradually turns into something darker,
text: and he has a realization.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: You're meat.

text: Starla turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: What?
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Grant steps onto the front porch to get some air. He's

dialog: door.
dialog: 
text: Across the street, THROUGH A KITCHEN WINDOW, a PLUMP MAN

speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Meat.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Grant stares at her, demented, and moves slowly toward
text: her, stalking her.
dialog: 
text: Something starts to push Grant's shirt up at his stomach,
text: like a bellybutton erection. The thing slips out of his
text: shirt -- a writhing, pointy tubule, aiming toward Starla's
dialog: back.
dialog: 
text: Grant looks at the nape of Starla's neck. Her delicate
text: ear. He becomes confused; he softens.
dialog: 
text: Starla turns to see Grant, his body now turned away from

text: He's extremely strong. She watches as the tubule twitches,
text: feeling its way like a blind snake.
dialog: 
text: The tubule comes to rest on her abdomen. Tears stream
text: down from Brenda's eyes. It pushes into her flesh.
dialog:

text: Starla, in her car with groceries, comes to a stop sign.
text: She looks at the telephone pole beside it and sees that
text: it's covered with flyers for missing pets.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Starla enters with a shopping bag. The lights are off.
text: CREEPY MUSIC plays.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant?
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
text: No answer. Starla tries to turn on the lights, but nothing
dialog: happens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Damn fuse.
dialog: 
text: She passes the door to the garage, noticing the lock.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Starla sets down the bags on the counter, looks around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant?
dialog: 
text: Again, no one's here. She sees a potted flower on the
text: counter. A green INCHWORM is crawling up the stem, little
text: by little. She stares at it, as if it's a portent.
dialog: 
text: She hears a MOAN, coming from upstairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Starla moves slowly into this dark room, looking for her
text: husband. It seems no one is here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant, where are y -- ?
dialog: 
text: Starla turns, when Grant POPS INTO FRAME. Starla,
text: startled, SCREAMS. Grant is sick and trembling. But,
text: worse, he's been transforming. There are small pustules
text: all over his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant. Oh my God. What happened
dialog: to your -- ?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks,
text: sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here.
dialog: I had a reaction to a bee sting.
dialog: He gave me a prescription. Said I
dialog: should be fine, in a couple days.
dialog: 
text: Starla stares at him, mute and horrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Don't look at me like that, baby.
dialog: Please? I'm gonna go get my...
dialog: prescription filled.
dialog: 
text: Grant grabs his keys off the dresser, puts them in his
text: pocket, trying to pretend he doesn't hurt.
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: I'll get if for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
dialog: 
text: He moves outside the door, leaving Starla, shell-shocked.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT GARAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: It's too dark to see much in here, but we do see Grant
text: putting meat into a garbage bag.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRANT HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Grant looks around to make sure no one's looking, as he
text: places the garbage bag full of meat into his trunk, closes
dialog: it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OLD BARN - EVENING
dialog: 
text: Grant moves through the forest, in massive pain, dragging
text: the garbage bag.
dialog: 
text: Grant comes upon the old wooden barn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Grant enters. It is almost completely dark. He hears
scene_heading: WEEPING. CHAINS RATTLE.
dialog: 
text: Grant peers over at Brenda, mostly in silhouette, sitting
text: on the nest he has made. She's chained up and MOANS
text: through a mouth gag. Grant walks to her. Her body is
text: horribly pear-shaped and misshapen, like some tumorous
text: pregnancy. Grant pulls her gag away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so
dialog: fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna
dialog: die.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Brought you munchies.
dialog: 
text: Grant pours the garbage bagful of rotting meat and dead
text: animals out in front of her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Been saving for a rainy day.
dialog: 
text: CLOSEUP: Brenda's face, still mostly in darkness. She
text: stares at the meat, simultaneously excited and repulsed.
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
text: She looks up at Grant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Grant, I'm sorry if I did something
dialog: wrong! I think I gotta -- I think
dialog: I should go to a hospital!
dialog: 
text: Grant doesn't respond. Brenda's eyes trail back down to
dialog: the meat.
dialog: 
text: Brenda's hand reaches out, and grabs a maggot-infested
text: pork chop, pulling it toward her.
dialog: 
text: We HEAR, but can barely see, Brenda CHOWING DOWN on the
text: raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT'S TRUCK - LATER
dialog: 
text: Grant gets into his pickup; he trembles and YELPS as his
text: body is wracked with pain and his body starts to transform
dialog: even more.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: There's a HARD KNOCKING on Starla's door. She swings it
text: open to see Bill and Wally standing there, worried.
dialog: 
text: Wally tries to see inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Grant around?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
text: No. He went to the pharmacy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Pharmacy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: He's got a... rash.
dialog: 
text: Bill and Wally exchange a glance -- maybe this means
text: something. Starla can see Trevor and Margaret, across
text: the street, talking to another neighbor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?
dialog: 
text: Starla shakes her head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Maybe she's ever called the house,
dialog: or -- ?
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: No. What...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: She disappeared Friday night. We
dialog: got reason to believe foul play
dialog: might be involved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Some kids found her necklace near
dialog: Tipper Creek, as well as what might
text: be her blood on a rock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: The problem, Starla, is, the last
dialog: person anyone saw her talking to
dialog: was Grant.
dialog: 
text: Starla looks at him, surprised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me,
dialog: we also saw him that night, with
text: mud all over his slacks.
dialog: 
text: Bill hands her his card.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Have him call me right away, okay?
dialog: 
text: Starla nods, distraught. Bill tries to smile kindly before
text: he and Wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors'
dialog: homes.
dialog: 
text: Starla closes the door behind her, distraught, panicked.
dialog: 
text: She looks at the foyer door, leading into the garage.
text: Her eyes fall down to the floor, where she sees what
text: appears to be blood drop stains near the door.
dialog: 
text: She gains courage, and moves off toward --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Starla throws open this door. She looks at old, unused
text: sports equipment. She grabs an aluminum baseball bat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Starla holds the aluminum bat, standing in front of the
text: door to the garage. She hesitates a moment. But then
text: she swings the bat at the lock on the door.
dialog: 
text: She swings it again, GRUNTING.
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: And again.
dialog: 
text: Finally, the lock is knocked off the wooden door.
dialog: 
text: Starla pushes away the useless lock, letting it fall to
dialog: the floor.
dialog: 
text: Starla steels herself, and slowly pushes open the door
text: into the dark garage. As she does, the horrendous stench
text: hits her. Terrified, she covers her face with her hand,
text: and enters.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT GARAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Starla sees what's there: not only a huge stockpile of
text: rotten meat, but a dozen dead pets. They are neatly
dialog: divided into various categories, and labeled: Pork, Ground
text: Beef, Cats, Dogs. The walls and doorway have been heavily
text: insulated so the smell doesn't sink into the home. She
text: looks on the floor and sees poor, dead Roscoe the beagle,
text: his tongue dangling out.
dialog: 
text: Starla starts to CRY.
dialog: 
text: She moves quickly back inside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Starla runs to the front picture window, and looks out
text: onto the street. She can't see any of the cops.
dialog: 
text: She turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone.
text: She looks at the card Bill gave her, and dials the number.
dialog: The phone RINGS, and:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERRY (O.S.)
dialog: You've reached Chief Pardy at the
dialog: Wheelsy Police Department. Please
dialog: leave a message and your call will
dialog: be returned as soon as possible.
dialog: 
text: There's a BEEP. Starla tries to speak through her SOBS,
dialog: pacing:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Bill, it's Starla!
dialog: 
text: As Starla passes the large picture window, she doesn't
text: see Grant staring in at her, his face now that of some
text: diseased cephalopod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: It's -- I think you better come
dialog: over right away -- I think Grant's
dialog: sick, he --
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
text: Starla turns to see the monstrous Grant through the window.
dialog: 
text: She just stops. They stare at each other for a moment.
dialog: 
text: And then Grant lets out a FURIOUS WAIL.
dialog: 
text: Starla turns and dashes toward the back of the house.
dialog: 
text: Grant disappears from the window.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: As Starla runs through here, she looks behind her at the
text: front door to make sure Grant isn't following.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT HALL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: She runs past a wall of family photos.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Starla sees the door on the rear of the house, leading to
text: the backyard.
dialog: 
text: She arrives at it, and flings it open --
dialog: 
text: Grant is there.
dialog: 
text: He lunges onto her. Starla SCREAMS and drops the cordless
text: phone, just as it starts RINGING. Grant crawls on top of
text: her body. Starla reaches for the ringing phone, but he
text: pins her hands above her head. He looks into her eyes.
text: He's CRYING. His voice and breath are sick and raspy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant, no!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: I loved you. I loved --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant, you're sick!
dialog: 
text: Grant is about to cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRANT
dialog: I wanted you by my side, but you --
dialog: I can't trust you now!
dialog: 
text: Starla's WEEPING, confused. Grant rips his shirt open.
text: Starla looks down to see the tubule protruding from the
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
text: now enormous yellow spore on Grant's chest. The tubule
text: feels over Starla's blouse, and then slips beneath it.
text: It starts to poke into her skin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Noooo!
dialog: 
text: Starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her. She
text: SLAMS the table into Grant's head. This hurts and
text: surprises him sufficiently to let Starla get out from
text: under him.
dialog: 
text: Starla grabs the cordless phone, which is no longer
text: ringing, and scurries behind the couch. She dials 9-1-1.
dialog: 
text: Grant thrusts the couch aside.
dialog: 
text: Starla crawls away again, when Grant attacks her from
text: behind. He wraps his arm around her neck, pulling her
text: back. He looks down at her with his sick, angry eyes, as
text: his arm -- now apparently jointless -- curls around her
text: like a snake.
dialog: 
text: Starla gasps for air. Her face turns purple. She hears
text: a SLAMMING on the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
dialog: Starla?!! Starla, are you in
dialog: there?!
dialog: 
text: Starla tries to speak but she cannot. Suddenly, we HEAR
text: the FRONT DOOR OPEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
dialog: Starla?!
dialog: 
text: Starla, with barely an ounce of life left in her, sees
text: Bill, Wally, Trevor and Margaret burst into the living
dialog: room.
dialog: 
dialog: They are surprised, to say the least, to see this diseased
text: humanoid strangling Starla from behind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Fuck!
dialog: 
text: The cops, freaked out, pull their guns. Grant makes a
text: SCREECHING SOUND at them. They SHOOT at Grant, nicking
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Grant jumps away from Starla, back into the shadows,
text: SCREECHING in anger and pain. Starla falls to the floor.
dialog: 
text: Grant slips out the back door and away.
dialog: 
text: The cops stare, gape-jawed and frozen with shock; what
dialog: the hell was THAT?!
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
text: Starla rubs her neck, COUGHING.
dialog: 
text: Bill Pardy runs toward the back door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill runs out into the backyard. Wally runs up behind
text: him. They look around at the trees surrounding the area.
text: Grant is nowhere to be seen.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PASTOR (O.S.)
dialog: We ask you now for the safe return

speaker_heading: PASTOR

dialog: 
text: Bill looks around the church. He spots Starla, in the

dialog: 
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
text: He also sees a group of OLD CRONES nearby, pointing at

scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: STARLA

dialog: 
text: They get in the car, Bill starts the engine, when --
dialog: 
text: Starla Grant pulls quickly into the parking lot. Bill

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Bill, I heard what you're doing.
dialog: I think I should go along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why? Listen, it doesn't matter.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's
dialog: still out there, how will you find
dialog: her? How, unless you bring Grant
dialog: in alive? Your best chance of
dialog: doing that is with me. I can talk
dialog: to him --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: He tried to kill you, Starla.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: He did. I know. But I got him

speaker_heading: STARLA

dialog: my fault, I know it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Starla, it ain't --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
text: It is. He'd been acting strange.
dialog: And the physical changes. I should
dialog: have told someone right away...
dialog: But I was just blind. I wanted to
dialog: pretend it wasn't happening... If
dialog: I don't do what I can to help now,
dialog: I just couldn't live with it.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S MOM
dialog: Kylie! What'd you do to your

dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYER FARMHOUSE - EVENING

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
text: This turns out to be a mountain

speaker_heading: FADE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Darkness has crept over the ranch, and the beautiful,
text: pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister.
dialog: 
text: The wind blows hard, WHISTLING through the long weeds.
dialog: 
text: A rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and
text: CLINKS on its half-bent perch.
dialog: 
text: A piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof, FLAPPING
text: incessantly against the wooden wall.
dialog: 
text: Trevor and Jack; the Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy; and
text: Margaret and the Older Cop are hidden around the ranch,
text: waiting, watching or dozing.
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Inside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and
text: it's darker. Bill, Starla, and Wally are here. Bill
text: peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the
text: trough. He looks at Starla; her head tilts to the side
text: as she nods off. When her head falls all the way, she
text: snaps back up, and catches Bill gazing at her.
dialog: 
text: Bill nods and smiles. She doesn't smile back; she's
text: embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she
dialog: wants to be.
dialog: 
text: They sit there for a moment in the dark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Hey, Starla, remember that time
dialog: when you were a kid and you came
dialog: knocking on my window in the middle
dialog: of the night?
dialog: 
text: Wally looks at them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Starla here's twelve. Guess I was
dialog: fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what
dialog: the hell you doing out there?'
dialog: She tells me she's running away to
dialog: Hollywood to become a big star.
dialog: She said she knew I was in ROTC,
dialog: and she was gonna need a bodyguard.
dialog: Invited me along.
dialog: 
text: Wally LAUGHS. Bill smiles. Starla is embarrassed, but
text: grudgingly enjoys the story.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody
dialog: can take care of herself, I think
dialog: it's you. I'm gonna have to

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yeah, maybe I did.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the
text: cow killer. The burning ember of the cigarette is blown
text: off by the wind. Jack searches for it in the dry grass,
text: trying to catch it before it starts a fire. He crawls
text: forward, slapping the ground, when he glances up and
dialog: sees...
dialog: 
text: A large, shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the
text: edge of the forest.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill, Starla, and Wally see Grant Grant emerging from the
text: forest. He has transformed into something much more
text: monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug-like beast, a clump
text: of cells and tumor-like protuberances. He has various
text: tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown
text: eyes on a potato. As opposed to just having the disease,
text: he now seems to BE the disease itself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jack and Trevor watch in amazement as Grant slithers across
text: the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out
text: prey. Jack turns to Trevor, pissed, and whispers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You said 'squid'!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: It got worse.
dialog: 
text: The Redneck and the Good Ol' Boy watch too, mouths dropped.
dialog: 
text: The diseased Grant slithers through the grass just a few
text: feet beside Margaret and the Older Cop. They duck below
text: the grass, looking as if they're going to have heart
dialog: attacks.
dialog: 
text: Grant approaches a cow. The cow makes a little MOO of
text: protest when he gets too close, and steps back.
dialog: 
text: The Grant-creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into
text: the cow's neck, piercing it. The cow stumbles, choking.
text: Blood spurts from her neck. And she topples over.
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill and Wally stare out the window, motionless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: What we gonna do now, Bill? Cuffs
dialog: won't even fit on 'im.
dialog: 
text: Starla musters courage. She stands, and moves out of the
dialog: barn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Starla, where you...?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Grant wraps a feeler around the cow's horns, and starts
text: dragging it back in the direction of the forest.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STRUTEMYER BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill motions through the barn window to Margaret.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Margaret motions to Trevor.
dialog: 
text: Trevor motions to the recruits.
dialog: 
text: And Starla moves slowly in toward Grant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant?
dialog: 
text: Grant turns and looks at her with his half-human eyes.
text: His breathing is loud, raspy, and sick. He sees, in a
text: wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up,
text: their guns at the ready.
dialog: 
text: Starla moves even closer. Bill and Wally are coming in
text: close behind her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant? It's okay.
dialog: 
text: As Starla and the posse get closer, Grant looks almost
text: scared. His eyes dart around from cop to cop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: You're just sick is all. But we'll
dialog: take you to get help right now.
dialog: I'll stay by your side, Grant,
dialog: just like I swore I would. For
dialog: better or worse. Remember?
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
text: Grant's huge milky eyes betray that he does.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Okay?
dialog: 
text: The posse inch in closer, tightening the circle.
dialog: 
text: Grant lets out a PIERCING SCREECH of protest. All of the
text: posse stop, terrified.
dialog: 
text: Everything is quiet and still except for Grant's gross
text: breathing. Deep: In, out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Okay, Grant? It's gonna be all
dialog: right.
dialog: 
text: Grant SCREECHES again: a warning. He looks from Starla
text: to Bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and GROWLS.
dialog: 
text: Then Grant's eyes close to half-mast, and he turns away.
text: His tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again
text: drags it toward the forest.
dialog: 
text: While Bill tries to decide what to do, the Good Ol' Boy
text: nervously blocks Grant's path. He aims his pistol at
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOOD OL' BOY
dialog: You stop right there, you son of a
dialog: bitch. I don't care what kinda
dialog: leprosy you got. We need to find
dialog: that girl. Now you can make this
dialog: peaceful, or you can make it hard.
dialog: 
text: Pause. Grant and the Good Ol' Boy stare at each other.
dialog: 
text: And then Grant SNAPS out a tentacle-arm, whipping it up
text: the front of the man's body, and back.
dialog: 
text: The front of the Good Ol' Boy's whole body is split neatly
text: in half. For a split second, he remains alive: the two
text: different sides of his split head look down in disbelief
text: as his organs spill out from inside him. And then he
text: topples over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Fire! Fire!
dialog: 
text: The posse SHOOT at Grant. Starla covers her head.
dialog: 
text: Grant is struck; he SCREECHES in pain. He lets go of the
text: cow. He slithers with incredible speed off toward the
dialog: forest.
dialog: 
text: Bill and the other posse members take off after him like
text: hounds on the heel of their prey. They SHOOT madly.
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
text: Starla watches as the posse follows Grant into the woods.
dialog: 
text: Starla stands alone and worried a moment, and then she
text: darts off after them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kylie is running a bath. She hears GUNSHOTS ECHO in the
dialog: distance.
dialog: 
text: She peers out a little window above the tub, trying to
text: see where the shots are coming from.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The posse run through this very dark forest after Grant,
text: leaping over brush and rocks. They're nervous, but also
text: excited, as the primordial hunting urge takes over. Their
text: eyes are filled with anger and bloodlust.
dialog: 
text: They're able to follow Grant only by catching glimpses --
text: a flash of flesh between trees, a tentacle disappearing
text: around brush.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: There he is! Over there!
dialog: 
text: They FIRE at the creature, taking chunks out of trees,
text: but missing. He's too fast.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CREEK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Grant slips around a boulder and splashes through a creek,
text: and into the plentiful trees beyond. He rustles thick
text: fronds as he moves up alongside the creek.
dialog: 
text: The posse run up the creek itself, splashing, trying to
text: peer through the leaves to get a shot at Grant.
dialog: 
text: Jack, carrying his revolver, trips and falls in the creek.
text: He cuts his knee on a sharp rock. He stands, and keeps
dialog: going.
dialog: 
dialog: They come to --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The posse come up out of the creek. They've completely
text: lost track of the diseased man-beast.
dialog: 
text: They stop, out-of-breath and looking around. They whisper:
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Where'd he go?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: We ain't never gonna find that
dialog: girl now.
dialog: 
text: The Redneck is WEEPING with rage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDNECK
dialog: I'll kill that asshole what he did
dialog: to Charlie.
dialog: 
text: Bill sees Starla run up behind them. He waves her back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Starla, get the hell out of here!
dialog: 
text: Starla takes a couple steps back, but doesn't leave. She
text: watches there, half in shadows as the posse creep around,
text: searching for some trail of Grant.
dialog: 
text: Margaret looks down into the bubbling creek. She sees
text: it's turning red. She looks up the trail of red, which
text: is rippling downhill in the water. The red flow starts
text: somewhere near a boulder.
dialog: 
text: Bill and Wally are searching in front of the boulder.
text: Margaret SEES, but they don't, Grant pulling himself up
text: on a tree branch and RISING behind them. Blood from a
text: shotgun wound is dripping into the creek. Grant, pissed,
text: lifts a tentacle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Bill!!
dialog: 
text: Bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him. He
text: falls back; the tentacle slashes inches from his face.
dialog: 
text: Bill BLASTS his shotgun up at Grant, but Grant is already
text: slithering swiftly back into the thick brush.
dialog: 
text: The posse squeeze themselves though the brush, following.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The posse emerge on the other side of the brush, only to
text: be confronted by a terrible odor. They cover their noses
text: and mouths as their faces shrivel in disgust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: What the hell's that smell?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: It's something dead.
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
text: The posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where Grant
dialog: had brought Brenda.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's coming from in there, ain't
dialog: it?
dialog: 
text: Margaret looks at Bill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Think he's inside?
dialog: 
text: Bill takes the lead, carefully approaching the barn.
dialog: 
text: The posse follows, their weapons drawn. The closer they
text: get to the barn, the more unbearable the smell becomes.
text: Only Bill, intent on the task in front of him, doesn't
dialog: react to the stench at all.
dialog: 
text: Bill leans his ear in close to the front door, and listens.
text: Through the door he can HEAR a QUIET SOBBING. Bill and
text: Wally exchange a look.
dialog: 
text: Bill steps back. He and Wally aim their shotguns at the
text: door. Bill nods to Margaret, and gestures for her to
text: open it. Starla watches all this from the rear.
dialog: 
text: Margaret swings open the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill and Wally move cautiously but quickly inside. But
text: they stop suddenly, in disgust and horror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Oh...
dialog: 
text: It's Brenda. And she doesn't look good. Her weepy little
text: head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is
text: what her body has become. This enormous ball of flesh is
text: nine or ten feet tall. Vestigial fingers protrude from
text: the sides. She is utterly immobile. Her flesh sloshes,
text: slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be
text: slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin. The
text: woman is in great pain. She SOBS. Her mouth and chin
text: are stained with blood.
dialog: 
text: The posse and Starla enter behind Bill and Wally and are
text: equally astounded.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: Oh, shit!
dialog: 
text: They see the source of the awful stench:
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
text: Brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and
text: horses and forest critters. They are mostly skeletal, as
text: they have been largely devoured. They're swarming with
text: flies. The stench is so bad the posse cover their faces
text: with the bottom of their shirts.
dialog: 
text: The SOBBING Brenda looks desperately at Bill and Wally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Something's wrong with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Uh, yeah.
dialog: 
text: Bill and Wally get in a little closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Brenda, um...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: I didn't want no one to be seeing
dialog: me like this.
dialog: 
text: As the posse inch closer, Brenda's whole body suddenly
text: LURCHES FORWARD a bit -- like whatever's inside her is
text: trying to get out and to the posse. Brenda SCREAMS in
dialog: agony.
dialog: 
text: The posse jump back. They stare as she recomposes herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: How are my boys, Bill? Are they
dialog: all right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's --
dialog: what's happening here, exactly?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: I'm so fucking hungry, Bill. I'm
dialog: so hungry. I just never knew
dialog: anybody could be so hungry.
dialog: 
text: Brenda tries to smile in a way she might charm her Daddy
dialog: into giving her candy. This is creepy as hell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Would you mind handing me a piece
dialog: of that possum there at your feet?
dialog: Little bit?
dialog: 
text: Trevor gags and runs out of the barn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Trevor vomits into some bushes.
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
dialog: Bill eyes poor Brenda.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I think we best get you to a
dialog: hospital right quick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: What the fuck they gonna do with
dialog: her in a hospital, Bill?
dialog: 
text: Again, Brenda SCREAMS. Her body LURCHES FORWARD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: Why's she doing that?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDNECK
text: Her tumors is moving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Bill, get her to stop that shit!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: It hurts!
dialog: 
text: Her body lurches forward AGAIN. She sobs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Help me!! Help!!
dialog: 
text: And then AGAIN. Starla notices that Brenda's skin is
text: starting to SPLIT AND TEAR on her side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Bill!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Little fuckers are tearing me
dialog: aparrrr- !
dialog: 
text: Brenda SCREAMS like a woman giving a thousand evil births
text: at once and her body RIPS OPEN in one part; and then, in
text: quick succession, ANOTHER, and ANOTHER. Bill looks out
text: one of the windows. Grant is peering in at them, smiling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: He led us here.
dialog: 
text: And then Brenda's body BURSTS OPEN COMPLETELY, like a
text: water balloon hitting cement, and thousands of little
text: SLITHERING EYELESS PARASITES with slippery black-red skin
text: like slugs spill forth. The horrid creatures, eight inches
text: long and a few inches thick, swarm over the posse,
text: completely covering them before they can react.
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Trevor sees the things flooding over the posse in the
text: barn. The parasites are especially drawn to the posse's
text: heads. Because there are so many, the weight of the beasts
text: knocks most of them down.
dialog: 
text: Trevor runs, but the things make it out the doorway,
text: covering him like lava in One Million B.C., and he buckles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A parasite slithers quickly and fluidly into Wally's mouth.
text: He gags on it. His eyes flip back up into his head, and
text: his body starts to spasm.
dialog: 
text: Jack tries to pull one away from his face, but it's too
text: slippery and it disappears inside his mouth. His body,
text: too, convulses, and he spits up blood.
dialog: 
text: Bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of
text: the Redneck and the Older Cop as well; whites of their
text: eyes, bodies convulsing, spewing blood. Bill sees the
text: things oozing up Margaret's neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Margaret, cover your mouth!
dialog: 
text: Bill sees Trevor outside the door in the dirt, trying to
text: slap the parasites off. Bill yells to everyone:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Don't let 'em in your mouths!
dialog: 
text: One starts to get in Bill's mouth as he speaks, but he
text: slaps it aside. Margaret pulls her shirt over her face.
dialog: 
text: Starla SHRIEKS. She puts her hand over her mouth as the
text: parasites rush up her. She's knocked over, and falls
text: back onto the floor.
dialog: 
text: A parasite slithers between Starla's lips -- when,
text: suddenly, a KNIFE thrusts down, pinning the creature to
text: the dirt, stopping it from oozing further into Starla.
dialog: 
text: Bill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand
text: firmly over his mouth. Bill swats more incoming parasites
text: away from Starla's mouth. He covers her mouth with his
text: free hand. He lies on top of her, mushing their bodies
text: and faces as closely together as possible so the things
dialog: don't get into them. The parasites swarm all over them,
text: flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight
text: their way inside their mouths. But Bill holds tight to
dialog: himself and Starla.
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
text: Eventually, the parasites give up on Bill and Starla, and
text: begin to slither away. Bill watches as they crawl off
text: the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound.
dialog: 
text: Eventually, they're gone. Bill takes his hand from
text: Starla's mouth. Starla looks around.
dialog: 
text: She sees Margaret lift her face from the ground, shivering,
text: holding her shirt over her mouth. They gaze out the front
text: door of the barn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Trevor pulls his face from the dirt and stands. He spits
text: violently and wipes the dirt off his tongue with his wrist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: They wanted us to eat 'em! Why
dialog: would they want that!?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill is trying to make sense of it all. He gazes down at
text: Brenda's body, her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton
text: spread out over the floor, split open like an enormous
text: bloody tiger rug.
dialog: 
text: He looks around at the posse lying on the floor in mangled
text: positions, their mouths and lips covered in blood, still
text: lightly convulsing.

scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Parasites crawl over rocks and out of the forest and onto
text: the ranch. The Strutemyer farmhouse looms nearby.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kylie is taking a steamy bubble bath. Her head is back,
text: her eyes shut; she's enjoying the warm water. The tub
text: faucet drips lightly in an uneven rhythm.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The parasites squirm up the side of the house, sticking
text: to the wood siding.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kylie glances out the window beside the tub, at the starry
text: sky and crescent moon, beautiful and still.
dialog: 
text: There's a KNOCK on the bathroom door. Kylie turns toward
text: the door -- as she does, a parasite crawls across the
text: window behind her, streaking a moist slimy trail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S MOM
dialog: Kylie! You're gonna turn into a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE

speaker_heading: KYLIE'S MOM
dialog: I know what turns into what. You
dialog: got school tomorrow. Finish up in

dialog: 
text: O.S. Kylie GRUNTS in vague agreement.
dialog: 
text: Kylie's Mom trots down the hall, to another door.
dialog: 
text: She KNOCKS once, then opens the door to --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kylie's younger sisters lie in single beds, reading
text: Goosebumps by bed-lamps clipped to the headboards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S MOM
dialog: Time to turn in, ladies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S SISTER 1
dialog: Just a couple more pages, Mom?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S MOM
dialog: Come on now.

scene_heading: KYLIE'S SISTER 1 KYLIE'S SISTER 2
dialog: Night, Mom. Night.
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Kylie's Mom start to close the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S MOM
dialog: Sleep tight. Don't let the bed
text: bugs bite.
dialog: 
text: Numerous parasites slither INTO FRAME, up the side of the
text: house, approaching the girls' bedroom window, which is
text: open a few inches for air.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kylie's Mom shuts their door completely. The girls turn
text: on their sides and close their eyes to sleep.
dialog: 
text: And the parasites pour in through the cracked window.
text: They slither over the walls. Their slimy black-red bodies
text: contrast sharply with the pretty flowered wallpaper.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KYLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The door cracks open, and a parasite enters. It slithers
text: silently over the linoleum tiles.
dialog: 
text: It arrives at the base of the tub, and crawls up the side.
dialog: 
text: Kylie continues relaxing, her eyes closed. She doesn't
text: see the parasite enter the soapy bath water at her feet.
dialog: 
text: Kylie hears a SOFT SPLASHING and peers down. She spots
text: the creature swimming toward her between her knees.
dialog: 
text: Kylie SHRIEKS and scrambles up to get out of the tub. As
text: she clamors out, she slips and falls to the floor.
dialog: 
text: The parasite squirms up Kylie's wet naked back. Kylie
text: SHRIEKS again, jumping up as she tries to slap the thing
dialog: off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Mom!!
dialog: 
text: The parasite winds toward her lips. Kylie goes to grab
text: it with both hands, but it slips through them. The thing
text: slides into Kylie's mouth as she looks down at it.
dialog: 
text: Kylie snatches the very end of the parasite's tail. Her
text: long, teddy-bear-spotted fingernails pinch it there,
text: digging into the parasite's flesh, barely stopping it
text: from sliding completely into her mouth. It wildly flaps
text: its tail like a docked trout, desperate to enter her.
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
text: Kylie falls to her knees. Her eyes roll back in her head,
text: and her body spasms while she holds tenuously onto the
text: very tip of the parasite's tail.
dialog: 
text: We TRACK IN to a CLOSEUP of Kylie's face: a slight white
text: electrical-telepathic charge can be seen SPARKING inside
text: her mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S VISION
dialog: 
text: We are RUSHING through some amoebic landscape, PAST
dialog: microbes and cytoplasm and cells, and to:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - CREATURE'S POV
dialog: 
dialog: Perhaps the memories of some creature not of earth. Its
text: eyesight is not like our own; it's in grainy black and
text: white and amber outlines. Various images FLASH in quick
dialog: succession, including the following:
dialog: 
text: -- We are on top of an alien ANIMAL, pinning it down. It
text: HOWLS beneath us as we tear into its flesh, feasting.
dialog: 
text: -- All around us, diseased monstrous BEASTS feed on more
text: alien animals. They lunge toward them and pin them down,
dialog: ripping them apart, like some National Geographic
dialog: documentary shot in Hell.
dialog: 
text: -- In FAST MOTION, unfamiliar plant life around us grows
text: sick and withers, dying out.
dialog: 
text: -- A group of diseased monstrous beasts CRY OUT in uniform
text: pain. They buckle to their knees; now they're dying.
dialog: 
text: -- The diseased beasts feed on their own appendages.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: 
text: Kylie tries to regain control of her mind. Her eyes fight
text: against flipping back in her head. Tears pour down her
text: face. She pulls the parasite out just a bit.
dialog: 
text: But then it SLAMS back into her and there are more SPARKS
dialog: inside her mouth --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - MANGLED INSECT POV
dialog: 
text: -- We are CLIMBING UP through a creamy, gelatinous yellow.
text: An opening slit widens in front of us, and we see Grant
text: slowly bending to look at us, the forest behind him.
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
scene_heading: KYLIE'S VISION - SERIES OF IMAGES - GRANT'S POV
dialog: 
text: -- We watch Starla soaping herself in the shower.
dialog: 
text: -- We make love to Starla, our hands on her face.
dialog: 
text: -- We sit over a convulsing Brenda, impregnating her with
dialog: our tubule.
dialog: 
text: -- We see the posse members coming in toward us.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: 
text: With a last, desperate effort, Kylie yanks at the exhausted
text: worm, pulling it fully from her mouth. It flaps in her
text: fingers. Kylie spits up blood.
dialog: 
text: Kylie tosses the parasite away from her. Though slightly
text: crippled, the little bastard writhes back toward her.
dialog: 
text: Kylie spots her curling iron on the counter; it's plugged
text: in, the red light is on. She grabs it, and swings it
dialog: into the wormy thing.
dialog: 
text: The parasite SQUEAKS and trembles with pain. Smoke rises
text: from it as Kylie digs the curling iron in deeper, burning
text: it, and, finally, killing it.
dialog: 
text: Kylie lifts the iron in front of her and looks at it.
text: The dead parasite is stuck to it, dangling from the metal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Mom!!!
dialog: 
text: Kylie drops the iron. She quickly steps into her clothes
text: lying on the floor. She runs out of the bathroom and
dialog: into --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kylie runs to the stairway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Mom!! Mom!!!
dialog: 
text: Kylie stops. Dozens of the things are slithering up the
text: stairs and up the handrail towards her.
dialog: 
text: O.S. Kylie hears her SISTERS' SCREAMS. She looks in their
text: direction, running toward their room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Emily!! Jenna!!
dialog: 
text: Kylie tosses open her sisters' door.
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STRUTEMYER GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kylie's youngest sister is on her knees on the bed, a
text: parasite sticking out of her mouth. Her eyes are rolled
text: back. Her arms flail spastically. The slithering beast
text: wags its tail as it disappears down her throat.
dialog: 
text: Kylie's other sister is backing into a corner, with
text: parasites crawling up her body. She's SCREAMING bloody
dialog: hell, trying to slap them off.
dialog: 
text: Kylie runs toward her to help. Kylie slaps the parasites
dialog: off her sister. But there's too many and they're too
text: fast. They slide into her sister's mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: No!! Nooo!!
dialog: 
text: Her sister's eyes flip back in her skull as the thing
text: disappears completely, and she starts spitting up blood.
dialog: 
text: Kylie sees the parasites around the room coming at her.
text: There's a clear path toward a window. Kylie runs to the
text: window, and shoves it open. As the things approach her,
dialog: she crawls out --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE AWNING - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kylie steps onto this shingled, angled canopy over the
text: front porch. She turns to see the parasites slithering
text: out towards her. She looks down. It's probably too far
text: to jump, but she has no choice.
dialog: 
text: So she jumps down onto --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FRONT LAWN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kylie lands, hard, tumbling over.
dialog: 
text: She glances back at the front of the house.
dialog: 
text: THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW she sees her Mom and Dad, eyes
text: rolled back, convulsing, spitting up blood.
dialog: 
text: More parasites are crawling towards Kylie through the
dialog: grass.
dialog: 
text: She spots her family's old Luv pickup truck on the driveway
text: in front of her. She breaks for it.
dialog: 
text: She throws open the front door, and jumps inside.
dialog: 
text: The things approach, crawling in after her. Kylie tries
dialog: to slam the door shut, but it won't; many things are stuck
text: in the door jamb.
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
text: They SQUEAK in a chorus of pain, trying to wriggle toward
dialog: her.
dialog: 
text: So she SLAMS the door AGAIN, and AGAIN, and she slices
dialog: the little bastards in half.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kylie makes sure none are inside.
dialog: 
text: She feels for the keys in the ignition. There aren't
dialog: any.
dialog: 
text: The creatures crawl up and over all the pickup's windows,
text: trying to get in. Slithery shadows cover over Kylie,
text: leaving her in almost complete darkness.
dialog: 
text: Kylie crouches down in on herself, and WAILS.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Starla, Trevor, and Margaret stand, wide-eyed and shaken.
text: All three seem to be in some mild state of shock.
dialog: 
text: Bill, suppressing his desperation, is trying to make
text: contact on his police radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: 11-41. We're gonna need paramedics
dialog: out here right away. We got four
dialog: men down.
dialog: 
text: Bill listens for a response, but there's only STATIC. He
text: presses the button again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Shelby, you there?
dialog: 
text: Still, only STATIC. Bill tries another frequency.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Shelby, this is Bill. We got an
dialog: emergency here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STATIC.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Goddammit.
dialog: 
text: Bill steps outside the doorway, to see if he can get
dialog: reception. Trailing off:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Shelby?
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
text: Starla sees Wally's body on the floor. His skin is white
text: and corpse-like. His mouth is streaked with blood. Starla
text: crouches beside him, and takes his pulse. Her hands are
text: visibly shaking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Is he alive?
dialog: 
text: Starla looks at Margaret, and nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Praise Jesus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: 'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking

dialog: 
text: Trevor looks about to cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: What the hell were those things?!
dialog: You ever seen anything like that?
dialog: You ever heard of anything like
dialog: that?
dialog: 
text: Margaret shakes her head. Trevor looks at Starla, who
text: also shakes her head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Me neither. And I watch 'Animal
dialog: Planet' all the fuckin' time!
dialog: 
text: Bill re-enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No reception out here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Bill, I'll run out to your car,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: That's a long ways. Them worms
dialog: are out there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: I'll keep my mouth covered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No. I'll go. The three of you,
dialog: you wait here. Get these folks,
text: out of the barn. The stench and
dialog: rot can't be any good for 'em.
dialog: 
text: Margaret and Trevor nod. As Bill starts to leave, Starla
text: grabs him.
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Be careful, Bill.
dialog: 
text: Bill nods. Makes a feeble attempt at a smile. He jogs
text: off into the forest.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Bill runs into the small glade, and looks around, trying
dialog: to remember which way he came from.
dialog: 
text: He gazes between some greenery, some distance away, and
text: spies a long-lashed deer munching on foliage. A couple
text: more deer and a fawn are eating as well. Bill looks at
text: them a moment, peaceful, perhaps a sign of some hope...
dialog: 
text: And then a parasite crawls up the deer's neck and slithers
text: into its mouth. Parasites crawl up the bodies and necks
text: of the deer behind it. The deer buck and flounce and
text: scratch trying to get the things off of them.
dialog: 
text: Bill runs away as fast as he can.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Trevor and Margaret carry Jack out of the barn. He's
text: bloated, corpse-like and covered in varicose veins.
text: Margaret is wearing a gag-like swatch of clothing tied
text: around her mouths, to protect themselves. Trevor's gag
text: is down around his chin so he can chatter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: It's got to be some Goddamn
dialog: biological weapons. Government's
dialog: testin' 'em out on us! 'Cause who
dialog: gives a shit if Wheelsy disappears,
dialog: right?!
dialog: 
text: They set down Jack and head back toward the barn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: I hope it ain't contagious. I'll
dialog: be pissed as hell I turn into a
dialog: big mollusk. I'll fuckin' sue, I
dialog: swear to God.
dialog: 
text: Starla, also wearing a gag, is kneeling beside Wally, who
text: is similarly sick and bloated. His lips are parched and
dialog: cracking.
dialog: 
text: Starla squeezes a wet cloth, dripping all the water onto
text: Wally's lips. Then she stands, and heads toward the creek.
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
text: She doesn't see Wally open his eyes behind her. He sits
text: up, and stares over at Starla with milky eyes as she kneels
text: down beside the water.
dialog: 
text: Starla dips the swatch of clothing into the creek, re-
text: wetting it.
dialog: 
text: She stands, and turns, only to see Wally directly in front
text: of her, standing between trees, almost completely covered
text: in darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Hey, sugarplum.
dialog: 
text: Pause. Starla pulls the gag from her mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Wally speaks with Grant's cadence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Marriage. It's a sacred bond.
dialog: Just like you said.
dialog: 
text: Starla stares at him. Wally almost looks weepy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: I'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle
dialog: you and all. I lost -- Lost my
dialog: head. I didn't want to do none of
dialog: the things I done. Not kill them
dialog: pets. Not make Brenda a womb.
dialog: But it's my nature, ain't it? How
dialog: can you blame a one for actin'
dialog: according to his nature?
dialog: 
text: Starla, too freaked to speak, takes a step back from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: I wanted to tell you what was going
dialog: on. But I didn't - didn't think
dialog: you'd love me no more. I never
dialog: knew... love, Starla, I --
dialog: 
text: Trevor and Margaret are setting down the Older Cop. They
text: see Wally standing. Margaret pulls down her gag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Wally?
dialog: 
text: Wally turns and stares at her like some angry animal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You all right?
dialog: 
text: Wally doesn't answer.
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Maybe you better sit back down.
dialog: You don't look so good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Margaret.
dialog: 
text: Trevor's staring at something. Margaret follows his eye
text: line. Jack and the Older Cop are sitting up, staring at
dialog: her, just like Wally.
dialog: 
text: The Redneck stumbles into the barn doorway, also staring
text: at them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYERS' FARMHOUSE/INT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kylie is still alone in the Luv truck. The windows are
text: clear; the parasites have abandoned their quest, just as
text: they did with the posse in the barn. But Kylie stays in
text: the car, trembling, afraid to leave.
dialog: 
text: She HEARS a DOOR OPEN. She sees her parents and her
text: sisters come stumbling out the front door of her home.
text: They're also bloated and diseased. Their chins and shirts
text: are stained with the blood they spit up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S DAD
dialog: Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on
dialog: out.
dialog: 
text: Her family lumbers up to the truck. They peer in with

text: close to the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S SISTER 2
dialog: Hi, Kylie. It's me.
dialog: 
text: Her family tries the door handles, but they're locked.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE
dialog: Get away!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S MOM
dialog: Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why
dialog: not to be with your family. This
dialog: is family fun day, isn't it?
dialog: 
text: They continue RATTLING the door handles, over and over.
text: They SLAP the windows.
dialog: 
text: Kylie SOBS. Her sister speaks in a singsongy voice:
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S SISTER 1
dialog: Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha-
dialog: ance.
dialog: 
text: Her Dad leans over and picks up a large rock. He carries
text: it toward the truck. He holds it up over the windshield.
dialog: 
text: Kylie SCREAMS as he SMASHES it down. The windshield
text: CRACKS, but doesn't shatter. He holds it up again.

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST NEAR STRUTEMYER'S - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill, out of breath, runs out of the forest --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTEMYERS' RANCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill emerges on the edge of the ranch, stretching five or
text: six acres out in front of him. On the other side of the
text: field is the gravel road, where his police car is parked.
text: Beside the field is the Strutemyer's farmhouse.
dialog: 
text: Bill HEARS a CRASH. He turns to see the diseased
text: Strutemyers in their driveway, all holding rocks now,
text: smashing the pickup's windows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
text: The Strutemyers stop, mid-swing. They turn toward him.
dialog: 
text: Kylie sees Bill through the rear windshield. She unlocks
text: the door, and jumps out of the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's -- ?
dialog: 
text: Kylie runs past her family and up to Bill. She grabs
text: onto him, and hides behind him, WEEPING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's going on here?
dialog: 
text: Kylie's Dad's cadence is also like Grant's:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLIE'S DAD
dialog: Well, hello there, Pardy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What happened to you, Dwight?
dialog: 
text: Kylie's Dad looks down at his own bloated arm.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANCHER (O.S.)
dialog: Hey there, killer.
dialog: 
text: Bill turns to see the RANCHER with the cleft palate, now
text: diseased, holding a shovel. He swings it into Bill,
text: knocking him down.
dialog: 
text: Kylie SCREAMS. Her family runs in toward them. She looks
text: around to see a couple more DISEASED RANCHERS rushing
text: toward them through the fields.
dialog: 
text: The Cleft Palate Rancher stands over Bill and raises the
text: shovel to bring it down again.
dialog: 
text: Bill feels for his shotgun, which has fallen into the
text: dirt beside him. He yanks the trigger.
dialog: 
text: The BLAST hits the Rancher in the foot. He buckles.
dialog: 
text: Bill stands, pulling Kylie with him as the other diseased
text: folks rush toward them through the fields.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 
text: Bill and Kylie dash toward the cluster of cars as the

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OLD BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The infected posse -- Wally, Jack, the Older Cop, and the

dialog: Margaret.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Now, what'd I say?! Y'all just
dialog: sit down! You need to get some
dialog: Goddamn rest! You're sick!
dialog: 
text: Starla watches this, by herself, next to the creek. She
text: eyes a rifle in the dirt.
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
text: Jack grabs a fistful of Trevor's hair and restrains his
text: arms. Wally pulls his pistols from their holsters and
text: tosses them into the dirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Let go!!
dialog: 
text: Margaret goes to grab her pistol, when the Redneck opens
text: his mouth wide and --
dialog: 
text: GLEEKS; that is, he sends a yellowish globby-stream
text: shooting out of the back of his throat. The glob SPLASHES
text: on Margaret's hand. Margaret SCREAMS, drops the pistol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It burns!!
dialog: 
text: Margaret looks at her hand as the gleek-liquid sinks into
text: her skin. The hand is swelling monstrously. It's soft.
text: Parts of it are nearly dripping off the bone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What'd you do to my fuckin' hand?!
dialog: 
text: Jack opens his mouth and GLEEKS too -- shooting the stream-
text: glob forward and onto her neck. Margaret SCREAMS again,
text: grabbing onto her neck.
dialog: 
text: Margaret tries to speak, but she struggles just to breathe,
text: as her neck puffs up, impeding her thorax.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: Meat.
dialog: 
text: The Older Cop buries his fingers into her neck. The puffy

text: stuffs the flesh into his mouth, eating it.
dialog: 
text: As Margaret topples over, dying, the other posse members
text: turn to look at a very freaked-out Trevor. The Redneck
text: opens his mouth at him, when --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA (O.S.)
dialog: Let him go!
dialog: 
text: The posse turn and see Starla, who has made her way over

dialog: 
text: A slithering parasite squirming out of the crater on his
text: face -- out of the Wally's brain.
dialog: 
text: The little thing squirms down Wally's body and slithers
text: off quickly into the woods. Wally falls over, dead.
dialog: 
text: The sick posse look at Starla, surprised, infuriated.
dialog: 
text: And then they leap at her.
dialog: 
text: Starla tries to shoot them. But she's out of ammo.

dialog: 
text: One opens her mouth and GLEEKS -- it shoots out and lands
text: on the car right beside Bill's hand.
dialog: 
text: The other little girl opens her mouth to GLEEK as Bill
text: jumps into the driver's seat. He slams the door shut
text: just as the oozy liquid splashes on the window beside
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Bill is grossed-out by this, but he doesn't have much

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: My friends are still in the forest.

dialog: trees.
dialog:

text: down to see she stumbled over old barbed wire fencing,
text: now long fallen and curling on the forest floor. Starla
text: forces herself up, as Jack closes in.
dialog: 
text: Jack grabs onto her blouse, SCREECHING furiously. When
text: he HEARS something and looks over to see:
dialog: 
text: Bill's police car, cruising over the forest floor, directly
text: toward him. Jack, frightened, lets go of Starla. He's
dialog: about to get hit when --
dialog: 
text: The police car suddenly stops, jammed between two trees,
text: inches from Jack.
dialog: 
text: Jack smiles, and moves toward Bill -- but Starla rises
text: behind him, holding a sharp rusty stake from the barbed-
dialog: wire fence.
dialog: 
text: She thrusts it forward, hard; and it pops out the front
text: of Jack's neck.
dialog: 
text: Jack turns to look at Starla, and topples over into the

speaker_heading: KYLIE

text: Bill nods.

speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant used to get filled up every

dialog: me. He was too old -- But he was
dialog: handsome. And he had that big ol'
dialog: Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess
dialog: I would have flirted with him too.

speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: My father, he was -- he was real
dialog: close to evil. People didn't know.
dialog: Still don't. From the time I was
dialog: a toddler he'd beat the hell out
dialog: of me. I don't mean just like a
dialog: smack for smart-mouthing... he
dialog: took a real enjoyment in it. And
dialog: when I turned eleven or twelve,

dialog: Anyway, Grant rolls in one day. I
dialog: fill his tank with like an eighth-
text: a-gallon as usual. And he notices
text: my lip's all swollen up, and starts
dialog: asking me how it happened. I don't
dialog: know why I chose then, why Grant --
dialog: I guess I saw an opportunity. And
dialog: I told him everything, first time
dialog: I told anyone. Grant was furious.
text: He picked up a tire iron, walked
text: straightaway into the garage, and
dialog: beat my father half to death. You
dialog: say it's not about love, Bill.
dialog: But that was the closest thing to
dialog: it I ever knew.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.

speaker_heading: STARLA

text: They look at each other. Bill takes his flashlight off

dialog: 
text: Bill hears a LAPPING sound behind him. He turns, aiming
text: the flashlight downward.
dialog: 
text: A DISEASED DEER is lapping a thick purple tongue on the
text: wound of a dead man. The sick creature is mostly hairless
text: and pink and covered in veins. Bulbous black eyes hang
text: on the sides of its head like a goldfish's.
dialog: 
text: The diseased deer glances up at Bill and GROWLS a low
dialog: growl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Fuck me.
dialog: 
text: The deer springs upward, bringing his hoofs into Bill's
text: chest. Bill is knocked violently to the gravel, dropping
text: his shotgun and satchel. The deer rears back and brings
text: his hoofs down into Bill again. They CRACK Bill's head
text: against the hard road.
dialog: 
text: Kylie, Trevor, and Starla see diseased deer coming in at
text: them from different directions. The deer SCREECH like
text: dying rabbits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Bambi-rats!
dialog: 
text: Trevor aims his pistol at a DEER jumping toward him. He
text: SHOOTS, misses. The deer knocks him down. The deer stomps
text: his feet, rearing up and down on Trevor's ribs, almost
text: like a little dance. The deer tears at Trevor's sleeve
text: with decidedly carnivorous teeth, forcing him into letting
text: go of his gun.
dialog: 
text: Kylie SCREAMS. She dives into a small space beneath a
text: rock overhang on the side of the road. She watches what's
text: going on from there.
dialog: 
text: Starla sees the Buick a few yards away. She glances beside
text: her to see the largest diseased deer of all, a HORNED
text: BUCK, careening toward her.
dialog: 
text: She dashes toward the Buick as fast as she can.
dialog: 
text: A TUMOROUS DOE leaps onto Bill, biting into his shoulder
text: and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him.
text: Bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able
text: to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun
text: above him. He tries to scoot himself back as he's being
text: battered. He reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of
text: his fingers barely graze the muzzle.
dialog: 
text: Starla arrives at the Buick, and starts to crawl into the
text: front seat.
dialog: 
text: But the horned buck is upon her. He bites into Starla's
text: ankle. She SCREAMS.
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
text: He yanks back on her, half pulling her onto the road.
text: But Starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her
text: might, and pulls against the horned buck's massive power.
dialog: 
text: The deer on Trevor starts pulling him off, dragging him
text: down the road as he HOLLERS.
dialog: 
text: Kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to
text: scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. It's just
text: a little too far away. She works up her nerve and slowly
text: starts to crawl out toward him.
dialog: 
text: As Starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on
text: her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able
text: to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition;
text: the ENGINE STARTS. She reaches one hand down to the
text: floorboard, pressing on the gas.
dialog: 
text: The Buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the
text: horned buck's mouth.
dialog: 
text: Bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. It's too
text: far away. But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the
text: rifle. She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into
text: Bill's hand. Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat,
text: and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him,
text: knocking the beast back.
dialog: 
text: The deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole
text: head and neck have been knocked askew. It topples over,
dialog: dead.
dialog: 
text: Bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. He stuffs
text: the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg.
text: The deer looks at him. Blood is running down Bill's face
text: and he looks half-crazed. Bill glances down and sees the
text: telephone wire wrapped around her ankle.
dialog: 
text: Bill pulls the trigger, destroying her.
dialog: 
text: He stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor. It
text: has dragged him a fair distance down the street. Bill
text: SHOOTS once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight
dialog: on.
dialog: 
text: Kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running
text: through the fields toward them.

text: neck is bent at an ungodly angle. Bone juts up out of
dialog: her skin.
dialog: 
text: Starla looks out her rear window and sees the SUV door
text: open, and the DISEASED DRIVER stumble out. His body is
text: battered and broken, but, still, he lumbers toward her.
text: He tries to speak, but his jaw is broken, and only a MUMBLY
text: MOAN comes out.
dialog: 
text: Starla struggles to get out of the car. Eventually, she
text: does, and she falls to the floor, amidst the broken glass
text: from the shattered window, and the water all over the
text: floor from the broken vases.
dialog: 
text: She sees the moaning driver limping toward her. He's
text: still trying to speak, but he's unintelligible.
dialog: 
text: The driver gets close, ready to grab her. Starla sees a
text: metal bar. She grabs it. And SLAMS it into the diseased
text: man's shin.
dialog: 
text: He topples over.
dialog: 
text: She crawls onto the fallen driver and brings the metal
text: bar down into his head, again and again, SHOUTING and
text: CRYING with fury.
dialog: 
text: Starla looks down at the man, who is very dead.
dialog: 
text: Starla looks up to see dozens of DISEASED TOWNSFOLK coming
text: at her, from down the street, between buildings. They
dialog: see Starla there.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Bill closes and locks the door behind them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The diseased townsfolk surround the little store on all

speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: What the hell are we going to do?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Just block the doors, any way you
dialog: can.
dialog: 
text: Bill grabs hammers and nails off a hardware bench.
dialog: 
text: Trevor knocks things off shelves and yanks up the metal
text: shelving.
dialog: 
dialog: Starla looks doubtful of this whole activity. But still,
dialog: she helps.
dialog: 
text: The storeroom has two doors. They start nailing anything
text: over them they can.
dialog: 
text: Trevor sees some slithering parasites coming in through a
text: crack in the upper corner of the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Goddamn snakes!!
dialog: 
text: Trevor aims his pistol at the things and starts shooting
text: wildly at them, BLASTING up the whole room.
dialog: 
text: Bill and Starla see slithering parasites coming in from
text: other cracks in the room as well. They also BLAST at
text: them. Dust is all around; they can hardly see.
dialog: 
text: Bill runs out of ammo. He grabs a hand-held Black and
text: Decker electric circular saw and turns it on. He starts
text: jamming it into the parasites, cutting them up, and putting
text: big slices in the floor. They SQUEAK with pain.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The diseased townsfolk WAIL and SLAP their hands on the
text: walls, almost rhythmically, like some tribal ritual.
text: Some push on the doors.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill hears something POP behind him. He turns to see a
text: little hole in one of the doors. Three diseased fingers
text: slip inside, trying to pull away more.
dialog: 
text: Bill uses the circular saw to cut off the fingers.
dialog: 
text: An arm pops through the door. Bill slams the circular
text: saw into that. Blood spurts. Bone grinds.
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
text: A man's eye peeks through another crack. Bill jams the
text: circular saw through the crack and into the man's face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The FACE-SAWED MAN backs away from the hole, clutching
text: his bleeding eye.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill spots a wide piece of shelving falling off the door
text: across from him. He runs over to the space, when the
text: circular saw stops turning. Bill turns to see he's
text: accidentally unplugged it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The diseased townsfolk have all gathered on one side of
text: the building now, putting all their efforts into tearing
text: down one door. Some have even climbed onto the roof above
text: it, curling off the gutter and roofing overhead.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FLOWER STORE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill grabs his leather satchel, and starts to reload his
text: shotgun. Starla sees that the diseased townsfolk have
text: almost torn down one of the doors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: This is stupid.
dialog: 
text: Starla goes to the other door, and starts tearing away
text: the planks they nailed there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What are you doing?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: We can't make it. Just get away,
dialog: when you get the chance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: He wants me, Bill! I'm going to
dialog: get him to take me to him! See if

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No, Starla! No!
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
text: Another full metal plate is pushed off the door. A
text: DISEASED MAN'S face peeks through. Trevor swirls to see
text: it. The Man GLEEKS, hitting Trevor on his chest. Trevor
text: looks down, in shock.
dialog: 
text: And the whole door and part of the wall bursts open. The
text: Diseased pour inside and around Trevor, GLEEKING all over
text: him, splattering his body with the burning liquid. Trevor
text: starts to puff up, swelling, becoming soft. They grab
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Nooo!
dialog: 
text: Bill grabs Trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him
text: away from them. But Trevor SCREAMS in agony; the liquid
text: has made his flesh too soft. His entire body splits apart
text: like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them.
dialog: 
text: Bill stares down in shock, still holding Trevor's arm.
dialog: 
text: Starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door.
text: She throws it open. None of the diseased are on this
text: side of the building anymore. She moves outside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FLOWER STORE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill follows her. Two DISEASED PEOPLE appear, SCREECHING
text: and running toward them. Bill SHOOTS them both. And he
text: makes a break for it, running as fast as he can across
dialog: the street.
dialog: 
text: He turns, expecting to see Starla right behind him. But
text: she has stayed behind, staring quietly at the ground.
text: Starla has tears in her eyes. She motions with her head
text: for Bill to go. Bill is confused.
dialog: 
text: The diseased townsfolk come up around Starla from the
text: sides of the flower store, no one paying attention to
text: Bill. They encircle her, slowly. Some SCREECH angrily
text: at her. She's too disgusted or fearful to even look in
text: their eyes. They BREATHE with SICK, RASPY breath.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISEASED WOMAN DISEASED KID
dialog: Starlaaaaaaa! Starlaaaa!
dialog: 
text: And they WAIL, in a cacophony of simultaneous voices, all
text: the deep angers, fears, frustrations, and jealousies they
dialog: inherited from Grant Grant, such as:

scene_heading: SMASHED-FACE MAN
dialog: You said for better or worse! You

speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: I'm sorry... I know I haven't

speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: We need... to... talk.

text: A few townsfolk remain behind. They look around for Bill.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SMASHED-FACE MAN
dialog: Pardy?!! Where are you, Pardy!!
dialog: 
text: But he's nowhere to be seen. They SCREECH angrily.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill runs as fast as he can across the street here -- the
text: same direction the hoard took Starla, but down a block.
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill falls against the side of this building, hiding in a
text: dark crevice. Down the way, he can see numerous dead
text: bodies, and a WOMAN chased down and tackled by some
text: infected townsfolk.
dialog: 
text: Some diseased townsfolk wander by Bill, looking for him.
text: Bill crouches down so he isn't seen.

speaker_heading: PASTOR
dialog: We've surrounded the town, you

dialog: 
text: Bill waits for them to pass. When they're gone, Bill

text: moving Starla across that street.
dialog: 
text: He makes sure no one's looking, and follows her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRANT STREET - LATER
dialog: 
text: One of the diseased pushes Starla too hard, and she falls
text: to her hands and knees. They keep pushing her. She
text: stumbles back to her feet and moves on. She's almost
text: hyperventilating.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRANT HOME - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Here, the Diseased Townsfolk around Starla stop. She
text: looks up to see that they've led her onto her own front
text: yard. Starla gazes up at her home:
dialog: 
text: The diseased have done a little remodeling. Part of the
text: front wall has been torn away, replaced with some primitive
text: thatched woodwork. The front doorway has also been
text: partially destroyed. Because of the sloppy reconstruction,
text: the roof is caved-in and sloping.
dialog: 
text: Diseased people sit in meerkat-like poses on all sides of
text: the Grants' home, watching out for trouble.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill, out of breath, arrives across the street. He can
text: see Starla standing with the diseased. He hides behind
text: some shrubs.
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The diseased push Starla up between them, violently, to
text: the front door.
dialog: 
text: Starla stops at the dark hole on the front of the house.
text: It's pitch black inside. She looks back at the rotting
text: faces behind her. And then slowly enters.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Starla balks at the smell. She looks beside her at the
text: garage; the wall has been torn out, and this has become
text: Grant's feeding area, with rotten meat, including some
text: bodies, in a pile.
dialog: 
text: Starla steps slowly forward, looking around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant?
dialog: 
text: Starla can see into the shambles of a kitchen from here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE ACROSS FROM THE GRANT HOME - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill looks at the diseased surrounding the Grant home.
text: They seem impossible to get through.
dialog: 
text: Bill eyes the house next door, maybe twenty-five feet
text: from the Grants'. He makes sure no one's paying attention
text: for a moment, and he darts across the street to a parked
text: car. The diseased don't see him. Bill gazes down the
text: street beside him.
dialog: 
text: The sun is just barely beginning to rise. They don't
text: have much time to move in the darkness.
dialog: 
text: Bill makes a break for the house next door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Starla walks into the kitchen. Cooking supplies and
text: condiments are scattered over the floor. She spots a
text: meat thermometer on the floor amongst other utensils.
dialog: 
text: She glances out the rear window. Diseased people are
text: guarding the backyard, looking away from the home.
dialog: 
text: She grabs the meat thermometer. She snaps the thermometer
text: part off the top, discards it, and shoves the long metal
text: spike into the seam of her skirt.
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Starla hears EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD, the song
text: she and Grant danced to earlier, starting to play through
text: tinny speakers.
dialog: 
text: Starla looks up through a missing section of ceiling; she
text: can see a tiny piece of Grant in the bedroom above her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant? We should talk.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill has made his way into the backyard. He looks over
text: at the Grant home. Some diseased townsfolk in the backyard
text: could conceivably see or hear him. He tries the back
text: door, but it's locked.
dialog: 
text: Bill notices a window slightly open. He starts to push
text: it up. It SQUEAKS LOUDLY.
dialog: 
text: He peers over at the diseased. They don't hear. He throws
text: the window up further, and crawls inside the home.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Starla stands at the base of the stairwell. The SONG is
dialog: louder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant?
dialog: 
text: She starts to ascend the stairs. They CREAK beneath her
dialog: feet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill peeks out the window, careful not to be seen by the
text: diseased humans around Grant's. Bill can see Starla in
text: the home next door, walking up the stairs.
dialog: 
text: Bill runs toward the stairwell here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Starla looks down the hall. Most of the walls have been
text: torn away.
dialog: 
text: Between wooden beams, Starla can see Grant's cumbersome
text: mass, his back to her, in what was once the bedroom.
dialog: 
text: In front of him, the SONG ENDS on the CD player. It starts
text: into the NEXT SONG on the album. Grant uses one of his
text: crusty tentacles to push the back button.
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
text: EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD starts over.
dialog: 
text: Starla walks toward him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Grant keeps his back to her. Starla takes in the room.
text: Photographs from their scrapbooks are all over the walls:
text: photos from their wedding, and vacations, and family
dialog: parties.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Hey, Grant.
dialog: 
text: Starla walks around Grant, giving him a decent berth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: You did some real interesting

speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: Starla walks by a window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Look, the sun's starting to come
dialog: up.
dialog: 
text: Starla starts to open the drapes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIGHBOR'S UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill happens to look through the neighbors' kid's bedroom
text: and to the home across the way where Starla is pulling
text: the drapes away from the window. She sees Bill there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Grant SCREECHES angrily at Starla. She quickly closes
text: the drapes, not letting on she saw Bill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Sorry. I didn't -- I didn't know
dialog: you wanted it dark.

scene_heading: INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill walks into this young boy's bedroom, filled with
text: airplanes and sports memorabilia.
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
text: He peeks around the window frame at the Grant bedroom
text: window, now closed to him. He makes sure his shotgun is
dialog: loaded.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Starla tries to change the subject by walking to a wall
text: with the photos.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: You like these memories, huh, Grant?
dialog: 
text: Grant looks away from her. Starla moves toward him, almost
text: seductively.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: You like being called Grant, don't
dialog: you?
dialog: 
text: Grant is silent. She gets closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: I think you do. You really do.
dialog: You like being Grant. Like when
dialog: we danced. And when you... made
dialog: love to me here on the bed.
dialog: Remember that?
dialog: 
text: Grant looks embarrassed. Starla becomes more brazen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: I know you've been alone, Grant.
dialog: Almost forever. From here to there
dialog: to there to here, there's never
dialog: been another one for you.
dialog: 
text: Starla almost looks as if she's about to cry, out of
dialog: compassion for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Grant. Grant, I could help you.
dialog: Be with you the way you want.
dialog: See, I want to live. I've never

dialog: 
text: She touches his tentacle with her fingers. He moves it

dialog: 
text: Starla moves her trembling fingers toward him again. She

text: distrustfully, breathing his deep, sick breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: You don't trust me, I know. That's
dialog: why I brought you someone, Grant.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
text: It's Bill. He's in the house next

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill glances down to see a diseased man looking up at
text: him. In fact, they're all looking up at him. Bill is
dialog: confused.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Grant looks at Starla with sad eyes, perhaps touched.
text: Starla smiles nervously, expectantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: See? I brought him here for you!
dialog: As an offering! To prove I love
dialog: you more than him!
dialog: 
text: Grant wraps his tentacle around Starla. Starla, though
text: obviously disgusted, touches his face with her hand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The diseased townsfolk break down the door, moving into
text: the downstairs below Bill.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill hears them approaching. He SHATTERS the window, and
text: crawls onto a small mock-balcony outside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Starla moves slowly in toward Grant, as if to kiss him.
text: Grant looks, well, joyful.
dialog: 
text: And then she yanks the metal spike from her skirt and
text: JABS it into Grant's eye.
dialog: 
text: Grant SCREECHES, blind and bucking. Starla SLAMS the
text: spike into his other eye.
dialog: 
text: And she STABS him again, shoving the spike into his

dialog: 
text: Starla leaps to the window. She throws open the drapes.

scene_heading: INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The WINDOW SHATTERS and the shot strikes Grant. He
text: SCREECHES, swinging his tentacles aimlessly around the

dialog: 
text: One tentacle SLAMS Starla against the wall, probably
text: breaking a rib or two. Another tentacle SMASHES the CD

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill is out of shells. He drops his shotgun. He grabs

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Starla, clutching her ribs and barely able to move, pulls

dialog: 
text: Bill tosses her the grenade. She tries to catch it, but

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBOR'S MOCK BALCONY - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRANT HOME - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bill lands hard on the lawn between the two homes. He

dialog: 
text: Through the window he sees Grant barreling down the stairs.
dialog: 
text: Bill SHOOTS Grant with the .38, SHATTERING the glass.
dialog: 
text: He UNLOADS the clip into him.
dialog: 
text: The diseased townsfolk surround Bill, grabbing him. Grant,
text: using the others' eyes to see, snaps his tentacle forward,

speaker_heading: SCREECHES.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRANT FOYER - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
text: Bill hears a quiet RATTLING sound. He looks around him.
text: And then sees, down at his feet, what is actually a

text: It quivers and trembles upward, its little bulbed spurs
text: popping out.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. GRANT HALLWAY - MORNING

dialog: Starla, over here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WHEELSY EXIT - LATER
dialog: 
text: In the Maxima now, Bill and Starla pull around a toppled

dialog: onto --
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD BEYOND WHEELSY - DAY
dialog: 
text: The sun is bright and beautiful, glistening on the car.
text: Bill and Starla breathe more easily and smile a little as
text: they head up this long, barren road outside the city.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CLUSTER OF STORES - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Bill and Starla pass through a small block of stores.
dialog: 
text: Starla gazes out the window to see people -- real, actual,
text: HEALTHY HUMAN BEINGS: men and women and children -- going
text: about their daily chores. Tears come to her eyes.
dialog: 
text: Bill grabs Starla's hand. She clenches his tightly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: We can probably get some first aid
dialog: and food at this gas station up
dialog: here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yeah. Good.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: The Maxima pulls into the station, and stops.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION MART - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Starla and Bill pile stuff up on the cashier's counter --
text: Band-Aids, gauze, alcohol; Power Bars and Gatorade. The
text: CASHIER rings it up, staring at them because of their
dialog: wounds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASHIER
text: Comes to 32.87.
dialog: 
text: Bill pulls money out of his pants pocket. As he does,
text: Starla glances down. His arm pulls up his shirt, and
text: Starla can see the black and yellow wound there on his
text: stomach. She turns away, looking around, confused.
dialog: 
text: Bill pays, smiles at the cashier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: There you go.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: A stunned Starla steps with Bill out of the station, moving
text: toward the car.
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
text: Starla stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Shit. I- I forgot... I wanted to
dialog: get aspirin.
dialog: 
text: She starts to move back inside. Bill stops her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or
dialog: aspirin?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Aspirin.
dialog: 
text: Bill smiles, and goes back inside. Starla moves quickly
text: with the bag of stuff toward the car.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION MART - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Bill pays for the aspirin, and walks out with it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bill walks out; the Maxima is still there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAXIMA - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bill gets in the driver's seat, puts his keys into the
dialog: engine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We'll just head up here into
dialog: Bishopville, get checked up in the
dialog: hospital. Then maybe we'll head
dialog: off to Hollywood after all, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: Bill turns to smile at Starla. She's aiming the .38 at
text: his face. Tears are streaming down her cheeks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my
dialog: best not to hurt anybody --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: You took Bill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: It's my nature.
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STARLA
dialog: And this is mine.
dialog: 
text: Starla pulls the trigger, the GUNSHOT CRACKS OUT.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
dialog: 
text: As the Maxima sits in the lot, ANOTHER GUNSHOT CRACKS
text: OUT. Then we hear the HORN BLARING.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAXIMA - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bill's dead body is slumped over the steering wheel.
text: Starla really can't bring herself to look at it, as she
text: reaches across it and toward the door handle.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
dialog: 
text: The car door flips open. The horn stops blaring.
dialog: 
text: And Bill's body is kicked out of the car, sliding onto
dialog: the pavement.

scene_heading: INT. MAXIMA - DAY
dialog: 
text: Starla WIPES the tears away from her face. She glances
text: out the window to see the cashier peeking out of the
dialog: cashier's station.
dialog: 
text: Starla scoots over into the driver's seat. She shoves
text: the car into drive.
dialog: 
text: And she takes off down the road, not looking back.
dialog: 
text: Starla's blanched and numb but the tears still keep coming.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO BLACK.
