speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: MAILMAN

speaker_heading: MAILMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: First time I got my dick wet.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: MAILMAN

text: YUUUUGE tits.
text: He motorboats two PARTY BALLOONS, then pantomimes hitting a
text: SPEED BAG and smiles at Pete.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Wow.
text: The Mailman nods and strokes Pete’s rolled-up mail. Pete
text: steps inside his front door.
speaker_heading: MAILMAN
dialog: (peeking inside)
dialog: Send Julie out for a sec so I can
text: get a peek at her in her little
dialog: dress.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Not gonna happen.

speaker_heading: MAILMAN

scene_heading: INT. PETE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

dialog: His new album just dropped, right?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Yeah, I downloaded it to your iPod
dialog: last night.
text: Julie smiles and tosses the iPod to him. Pete kisses her
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hey, check it out. They renovated
dialog: the cabins on Lake George! We
dialog: should nail down dates ASAP. We
dialog: won't have to bring the shovel this

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I’m not sure I’1ll be able to go
dialog: camping this summer.
text: Pete stops dancing.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Of course you’re going. We go every

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I don’t have a lot of summers left
dialog: with my friends.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Are they dying?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Austin’s going to college in

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You’re only a sophomore.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I’m gonna be a junior.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It’s only a few days...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It’s a whole week. But can we talk

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: Yeah... of course.

speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: You know, you guys really don’t
dialog: have to come. Most of the parents
dialog: won’t even be there.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: We wouldn’t miss your prom party
dialog: for the world, sweetie. And we've
dialog: already got the sitter.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: But it’s gonna be super lame. You
dialog: should go do something fun instead.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: It’s fun for us to spend time with
dialog: you.
text: Hint not taken, Kayla sits back and chews her lip.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Whatevs.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: So who’s this Dex boy you’re going
dialog: with tonight?
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: He’s just a guy from school.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Anything we should know about him
dialog: for when you introduce us?
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I’m NOT introducing you.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: But-—
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: He’s a senior. Please don’t do this
dialog: to me! Mom?!
speaker_heading: MARCIE
dialog: Stop antagonizing her, Mitchell.
dialog: He shrugs, what was I doing?
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Pull over here. Right here!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What? Why? The Harrington’s house
text: is at the end of the block.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I think I know where my best friend
dialog: lives.
text: Mitchell pulls over and they all hop out of the car. Kayla
text: notices some KIDS in front of the house.
speaker_heading: KAYLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom, you guys are gonna wait a few
dialog: minutes before you come in, like we
dialog: talked about, right?
speaker_heading: MARCIE
dialog: Yes, honey.
text: Mitchell looks confused. Marcie shoots him a look.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Okay, Peanut. We’ll give you a five

speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Make it ten.
scene_heading: INT. HUNTER’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dad, c’mon!

speaker_heading: HUNTER (0.S.)
dialog: Being on time is for losers, Sam.
dialog: You know that!
text: Sam sighs, turns to her mother.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do I look okay?
scene_heading: HUNTER’S EX-WIFE
dialog: Are you kidding? You look
dialog: beautiful, sweetheart!
text: Sam nervously fidgets with her prom dress, then shakes her

speaker_heading: HUNTER’S EX-WIFE (CONT’D)
dialog: Hunter, are you coming?
speaker_heading: HUNTER (0.S.)
dialog: Almost, give me one minute!
scene_heading: HUNTER’S EX-WIFE
dialog: Hurry up!
speaker_heading: HUNTER (0.S.)
dialog: Please stop talking!
text: Sam paces, upset.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I wanted to get there before Kayla.
dialog: And she’s probably already there!
scene_heading: HUNTER’S EX-WIFE
dialog: Why? Is something going on with you
dialog: and Kayla?
text: Sam shakes her head, upset; she clearly doesn’t want to talk
text: about it. Annoyed, Hunter’s Ex-Wife heads for his bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. HUNTER’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: She knocks and HUNTER PHELPS (40, a likeable wise-ass) opens
text: the door a crack. He’s in a towel, his hair still wet.
scene_heading: HUNTER’S EX-WIFE
dialog: What the hell, Hunter? Sam’s gonna
dialog: be late and you take the longest
dialog: shower ever?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Sorry, but I was really dirty.
text: A NAKED HOT GIRL walks past the door and spots Hunter’s Ex-
text: Wife. She waves to Hunter’s Ex-Wife, embarrassed. Caught,
text: Hunter smiles and shrugs.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: She was filthy, too, god bless her.
text: Hunter’s Ex-Wife shakes her head, disgusted.
scene_heading: INT. DIMLY LIT ROOM - LATER
text: CLOSE ON a pair of giant distorted EYES searching with

text: scans the yard from the safety of his bedroom and locks in on
text: his target: Julie -- as she talks with Kayla in a gazebo.
speaker_heading: PLLLFFFF .
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Hello, my love. Yes, the sun is
dialog: rather strong. Of course I’1ll rub
dialog: suntan oil on your back. I happen
dialog: to have some right here.
text: Lotion squirts from a bottle.
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: How does that feel? Is it too
dialog: rough? Oh, it’s just right, my
dialog: darling? Mmmm.
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Eli! There’s no toilet paper in

speaker_heading: ELI’S MOM
dialog: Eli!?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Not now, Mom!
dialog: (back to Julie)
dialog: Now, where were we, my love?
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Hurry up! It was NOT a clean break!
text: The moment ruined, Eli angrily rubs the lotion in his hand
text: into his elbows.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Okay!
scene_heading: EXT. PETE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hunter, his Ex-Wife and Sam walk up the path to the house.
scene_heading: HUNTER’S EX-WIFE
dialog: Do you have anything you want to
dialog: say, Hunter?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Like what?
text: His Ex-Wife motions toward Sam. Hunter looks confused.
scene_heading: HUNTER’S EX-WIFE
dialog: How does she look?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (to Sam)
dialog: We both look great, honey. Let’s do
dialog: this shit.

scene_heading: EXT. PETE’S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Julie talks with Kayla by the gazebo.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I wish Tina was coming with us
text: instead of Sam.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I wish we were all going together,
dialog: but you know Tina couldn't come.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I know. And I’m not saying I hate
dialog: Sam, just that I don’t want her in
dialog: our limo because she’s super
dialog: lame... I guess I do hate her a
dialog: little bit.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: We've been talking about going to
dialog: prom together since we were in
dialog: third grade. So don’t be a dick.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Fine. But I swear to god, if she
dialog: says one more word about Katniss-—
speaker_heading: SAM (0.S.)
dialog: Hey guys.
text: Julie and Kayla turn to see Sam.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Oh, hey!
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I need a refill.
text: Kayla walks away as Julie and Sam hug each other hello.
scene_heading: EXT. PETE’S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING
text: PROM-GOERS and PARENTS enjoy the food and drinks at the
text: catered party. Mitchell talks to Pete as he samples the hors
dialog: d’oeuvres.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Delicious.
text: Pete nods. Across the yard, Mitchell sees some kids looking
text: in his direction and laughing. Are they laughing at his
dialog: pants?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: (suddenly insecure)
dialog: I was filling out an application at
dialog: Macy’s when the salesgirl talked me
dialog: into these pants. She said this is
dialog: the style these days.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I thought Kayla might like them,
dialog: but I can’t get a read. Thoughts?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: They're... seasonally appropriate.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Would you wear them?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: If I had your calf development,
dialog: maybe. I don’t, though. So, no, I
dialog: wouldn't consider wearing them.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (glances at his calves)
dialog: I do take stairs when I can.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Dude, you can’t afford pants that
dialog: go all the way down?
dialog: 10.
text: Mitchell shakes his head. He doesn’t need to look; he knows
text: it’s Hunter. Hunter hugs Pete, then Mitchell.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: You guys catch that Mets game? Just
text: caught the end on the radio on the
text: ride over. Craziness.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I recorded it, so don’t-
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: They won 4-3 in ten.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Ass.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: I just saved you three hours.
text: Just then, an attractive SINGLE MOM walks by.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: What do we have here?
text: Single Mom smiles suggestively at Pete, who quickly looks
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: RANDOM PARENT (0.S.)
dialog: Smile!
text: Pete, Mitchell and Hunter turn to the camera and smile.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (through smiling teeth)
dialog: You should be tearing that ass
dialog: apart, Pete.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (through smiling teeth)
text: No one’s ass is getting torn.
text: The camera CLICKS, the Random Parent walks away and the guys
text: get back to checking out Single Mom, who is bent over, fixing
text: the hemline on her daughter’s prom dress.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Dude, what the hell? It’s been
dialog: eight years!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I know that. I’ve been a little
dialog: busy raising my daughter.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Well, there’s no rule that says you
dialog: can’t slap a milf in the face with
dialog: your dick and still be a good dad.
text: Mitchell nods in apparent agreement. It’s a Hallmark moment.
scene_heading: INT. JULIE'S ROOM - EVENING
text: ON SAM AND KAYLA, who both look confused. Julie holds an
text: unraveled CONDOM. The girls move in for a closer inspection.
text: Kayla catches a whiff.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Ew! Do they come in any other
dialog: smells?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Wait! Does this mean...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: Austin’s been very patient. So-
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: (excited; laughing)
dialog: You whorebag!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So, you're gonna do it with him?
dialog: Like... all of it?
text: Kayla rolls her eyes. Sam notices, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: He’s going to college soon. I want
dialog: to be his first and I want him to
dialog: be mine.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Does he know?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: He didn’t need much convincing.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I’m proud of you, skank.
text: Sam sees how impressed Kayla is with Julie and jumps in:
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I‘ll probably do it, too. With
dialog: Chad.
text: Incredulous, Julie and Kayla turn to Sam.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Huh? You barely know him.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: He only asked you because he’s
dialog: Austin’s friend and he didn’t have
dialog: a date.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So what? It’s prom. Why not have
dialog: the sex?
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I call bullshit.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What’s bullshit? I’m definitely
dialog: getting some sausage tonight.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Sausage?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: Weiner. Dong. Whatever.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Sam, you don’t have to-
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm tired of doing boring shit. I’m
dialog: ready for some cock action tonight.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: You're serious?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: As first period gym.
text: Kayla raises a brow, is she for real?
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Then count me in.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So we’re all doing it tonight.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Looks like it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Awesome.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Amazing.
text: Both girls nod. Julie watches the back and forth.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (challenging)
dialog: Maybe we should put it in writing.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: (eyes narrowing; not
dialog: backing down)
dialog: I'd like that.
scene_heading: EXT. PETE’S YARD - LATER

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I’m excited for the kids.
text: Julie, Sam and Kayla hang out with AUSTIN (Julie’s boyfriend,
text: well-mannered) and CHAD (Sam’s date, lanky with Beiber hair).
text: Austin and Chad have CARROT STICKS up their noses and they’re
text: barking like walruses. The girls laugh.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: They’re gonna have so much fun.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (checks his watch;
dialog: disinterested)
dialog: Yeah, should be a blast. When are
dialog: they leaving?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Chad seems like a nice kid, huh,
dialog: Hunter?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Not a clue.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Has Sam been dating him long?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: What, am I in the PTA?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I thought you might know, since
dialog: Chad’s mom is Debbie Doyle.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Debbie Doyle from high school? Top-
dialog: of-the-pyramid Debbie Doyle?
text: Pete nods.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I always wanted to nail Debbie
dialog: Doyle. But she was a tough crack to
dialog: nut.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: She’1l probably make an appearance
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Sweet!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (to Pete)
dialog: Which one is Kayla’s date?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That one. Dex.
text: Pete points to the other side of the yard where DEX (18 but
text: looks 25, enormous) smokes a cigarette. Dex leans out over
text: the deck and checks out the women at the party like a
text: vulture. He rubs his patchy mustache. Mitchell’s face falls.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I do not like the looks of this Dex
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: He looks like the type who owns
dialog: exotic pets.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Don't listen to him, Mitchell.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Seriously, though, I’d get Kayla
text: started on a Z pack first thing in
dialog: the morning.
text: Mitchell looks really nervous.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I’m going to set him straight
text: before they leave, just in case.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Please let us know when you’re
dialog: gonna do that.
speaker_heading: HUNTER

speaker_heading: ELI

speaker_heading: DEX

speaker_heading: DEX

dialog: hooked it up.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL

speaker_heading: DEX

dialog: Don’t worry, Mr. Harrington.
text: The other kids climb into the limo. The guys watch Dex slap
text: Kayla’s ass as she climbs in. The limo takes off.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Who’s up for some binge drinking?
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - LATER
text: The kids are having fun in the back seat. Sam suddenly leans
text: over and kisses a surprised Chad.
text: Kayla, in response, snuggles up to Dex, who dives in for a
text: raunchy tongue-flailing makeout. Kayla engages for a few
text: seconds then pulls away and laughs nervously.
text: Austin looks at Julie, what's going on here? Julie shrugs.
text: In the front seat, Seth is out of his tuxedo and is now
text: sporting stained cargo shorts and a Garbage Pail Kids t-
text: shirt. He zips down the partition.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hey, my name is Seth. Shit’s gonna
dialog: get epic up in here now that the
dialog: ‘rents are in the rearview!
text: The kids look at each other.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Put the partition back up... Seth.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: That’s cool!
text: The kids laugh as the partition slides back up, then
text: immediately slides back down.
speaker_heading: SETH (CONT’D)
dialog: Before I vamanos, though, let me
dialog: just say that I see some long faces
dialog: back there.
text: The kids look at each other again, what the fuck is with this
dialog: guy?
speaker_heading: SETH (CONT’D)
dialog: I got just the thing to turn those
text: frowns upside down. Who’s down for
dialog: a little...
dialog: (waves a baggie)
dialog: Crystal? Made it myself. I’m no
dialog: Heisenberg, but it’s good shit.
dialog: Who’s down?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I’d do a bag.
text: Julie and Kayla are shocked.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Julie and Kayla)
dialog: What? I’m up for anything tonight.
dialog: (quickly; to Seth)
dialog: But no one else wants any, so no
dialog: thanks. I can’t eat a whole bag by
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I get it. No tweakers on board. How
dialog: about we make it snow up in this
dialog: bitch?!
text: He waves another baggie filled with coke.
speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: We could use some beers later.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: And some energy drinks!
text: Dex shoots him a look.
speaker_heading: CHAD (CONT'D)
dialog: But mostly beer.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Beer? Seriously?
dialog: (deflated)
dialog: Yeah, I can do that.
scene_heading: INT. JULIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Eli pokes around. He opens the medicine cabinet. He applies
text: Julie’s deodorant. Heaven. He picks up Julie’s toothbrush and
text: licks it.
scene_heading: EXT. PETE’S BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Pete and Hunter sit around a FIRE PIT drinking beer. Hunter
text: and Mitchell have tequila shots.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We should all be proud of
dialog: ourselves. We’ve raised three
dialog: pretty great girls.
text: The guys raise a glass and drink.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Isn't it crazy? In a few years,
dialog: they’1l be off to college.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Nuts.
text: Hunter throws back a shot.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I’m sure going to miss Kayla around
dialog: the house. The nice talks and the
dialog: hugs. I’1l miss the hugs the most.
text: Mitchell then downs an entire beer in a few seconds.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, guys. What I just said
dialog: there, that was bullshit. There are
dialog: no hugs. I actually think Kayla’s
dialog: embarrassed of me.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (lying)
dialog: I doubt that.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Seriously? It’s pretty fucking
text: obvious.
text: Pete shoots him a look.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: She hasn’t called me “dad” in a
dialog: year. She’s just calls me “hey.” As
dialog: in, “hey, is that what you're
dialog: wearing?” and “hey, ever heard of a
dialog: courtesy flush?”
text: Mitchell sighs, then throws back a shot.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s because I lost my job.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Are you getting any interviews?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: No. And my resume is all over
dialog: Monster. What else can I do?
text: Pete shrugs.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe I am an embarrassment.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Hey, that’s bullshit, man.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, look at you.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: You've got... a lot of... good
text: stuff going on.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Like...?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You're a great friend!
text: Mitchell shrugs, that’s not doing it for him. Pete and Hunter
dialog: think hard...
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Look at those calves!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, I mentioned those earlier.
text: The guys try, but can’t think of much else until...
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: You're awesome at sound effects!
dialog: That honking horn sound? You could
dialog: be the next Michael Winslow!
text: Mitchell makes a bicycle honking noise with his mouth.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s the one! So good.
text: The guys muster a laugh. Mitchell cheers up.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I am pretty good at that.
text: The guys nod.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: You dudes wanna hear some of the
dialog: new ones I’ve been working on?
speaker_heading: PETE HUNTER
dialog: Maybe later. No.
text: Mitchell smiles and nods.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ll get a few more logs for the
dialog: fire.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: (seizing the opportunity)
dialog: Put another shrimp on the barbie!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Maybe stick with the sound effects.
dialog: Accents aren't in your wheelhouse.
text: Mitchell nods. He makes the honking sound as he walks away.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (quietly; to Pete)
dialog: Why do we hang out with him?
text: Pete smiles. Mitchell returns with a couple of logs.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You know, you’re not the only one
dialog: with daughter problems, Mitchell.
dialog: Julie’s bailing on our annual
dialog: camping trip.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: That shit is normal, guys. Kids
dialog: pull away from their parents. And
dialog: you know those three girls. They’re
text: attached at the hip. With the
dialog: soccer and karate and whatever
dialog: else.
text: Pete and Mitchell share a confused look.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Sam and I have an unspoken
dialog: understanding. We give each other
dialog: space and we’ll reconnect sometime
dialog: during her mid to late-twenties.
scene_heading: INT. JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Eli opens Julie’s underwear drawer and his jaw drops as if
text: he’s found the Lost Arc of the Covenant. He spots a bottle of
text: HAND LOTION on top of the dresser.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: You’ve been out in the sun for a
text: long time, Julie. Time to reapply.
text: SPLOOSH, SPLOOSH. He pumps some lotion into one hand and
text: picks up a pair of panties with the other. He notices the
text: CAMPING BROCHURE in the drawer. He eyes it curiously.
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: EXT. PETE’S BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Mitchell is drunk and in a much better mood, playing drums on
text: the table with a couple of serving spoons.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Alright, this was a solid pre-game.
dialog: Let’s hit Taste of Honey.
text: Pete shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
text: Fucking pussies. Afraid of a strip
dialog: club.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We're not pussies. We’re parents.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: C'mon, dude, when’s the last time
dialog: you had an entire night without
dialog: Julie? Let’s pillage!
text: Suddenly, SMOKE pours out from the garage door.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Uh, Pete!
text: Pete frantically runs over and hits the garage door opener.
text: Smoke billows out!
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: The garage is filled with smoke. The guys start coughing.
text: When the smoke clears, they find Eli sitting in Pete’s beat
scene_heading: up 2004 VOLVO STATION WAGON.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Oh, hey, Mr. Harrington, gentlemen.
scene_heading: INT. PETE’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Pete and Mitchell carry Eli, who looks fine, but distraught,
text: into the house. Hunter slaps him across the face.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: What the hell?! I’m awake!
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: I know.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Why are you trying to off yourself
dialog: in my garage?
text: Without a word, Eli hands Pete the CAMPING BROCHURE.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: This kid really hates camping.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Turn it over.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (reading)
dialog: We, Kayla, Julie and Sam, who have
dialog: known each other our whole lives,
dialog: wish to this night one that we will
dialog: never forget...
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: That’s sweet—
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: -Keep reading.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: .--and hereby swear that tonight,
dialog: on the occasion of our first ever
dialog: prom, we will all have...
dialog: (strains to read)
dialog: I can’t make out this word.
speaker_heading: ELI
text: Sorry. It’s smudged from my tears.
dialog: Sex. The word is sex. We all agree
dialog: to have sex for the first time with
dialog: our prom dates.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What? WHAT??
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, that... can’t be right. What is
dialog: this?!
text: Hunter grabs it.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: It’s some sort of contract.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: It’s a fuck pact!
text: The guys look around at each other, completely STUNNED.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Is that... binding?
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PETE’S CAR —- MOMENTS LATER
text: Pete drives the crappy Volvo wagon while on his cell.
text: Mitchell rides shotgun; Hunter and Eli are in the back. The
text: tension is palpable.
speaker_heading: PETE
text: Straight to voicemail again.
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: I’m sure this is some kind of
dialog: mistake. I would have known about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I knew I shouldn’t have gotten her
dialog: that HPV vaccine!
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: If this kid has sex with Sam, I can
dialog: forget about getting with Debbie.
dialog: And after all these years, that
dialog: would be tragic.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We're almost there. Let’s talk
dialog: strategy.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Get in, spread out. Grab the kids
dialog: off the dance floor, forbid them
dialog: from having intercourse.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: No! No! No! Check the dance floor
text: last. Handicapped bathroom stalls
dialog: first. Regular people stalls
dialog: second.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Bathrooms? It’s their first time
dialog: for chrissake!
dialog: (to Pete, re: Eli )
dialog: Why the hell did you bring him?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Seriously. Pull over. Let’s dump
text: his ass at the Arby's.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: He’s a good kid.
dialog: (softly; to Mitchell)
dialog: And I have rope and cutlery in my
dialog: garage.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I’m just saying there probably
dialog: won’t be any sex happening on the
text: dance floor. But bathrooms are in
dialog: play. Last week, my cousin Freddie
text: sixty-nined with a lady in a port-o-
dialog: potty behind Subway!
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: That couldn’t have been pretty.
dialog: Meatball is the five dollar
dialog: footlong this month.
text: Pete reacts by giving it a bit more gas.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: The point is that teenagers will
dialog: have sex anywhere they can.
text: Eli notices Pete look at him in the rearview.
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Not me, though. Not with Julie. Our
dialog: first time will be magical. I have
dialog: it all planned. No jackhammering.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Stop talking, Eli.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: The loser may have a point. My
dialog: first time was with Dawn Sadler in
text: a sewer drain next to a rotting
text: raccoon carcass.
text: Mitchell shakes his head in disgust.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (bragging)
dialog: We did it four times.
text: Eli nods, impressed. Pete hits the gas even harder. The wagon
text: shakes as it hauls ass down residential streets.
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: The tastefully decorated room is packed with horny PROM-
text: GOERS. It’s a beautiful evening. Julie and Austin dance
dialog: together and have a great time.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It’s going to be a special night.
text: Austin nods and kisses her romantically. Sam sees Kayla
text: looking over and responds by grinding on Chad, who's
dialog: surprised.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So do you think you're more of a
dialog: Gale or a Peeta to my Katniss?
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: I have no idea what you’re saying
dialog: right now.
text: Sam keeps grinding, but with a little less interest. Kayla
text: tries to mimic Sam’s moves. Dex is into it, but is distracted
text: by the 50 YEAR OLD D.J., who looks terminally bored.
speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: I wish I had my tables. I would
dialog: totally battle D.J. Fossil right
dialog: now. I’m not feeling this guy’s
dialog: beats at all.
text: Kayla grinds hard. Dex takes notice.
speaker_heading: DEX (CONT'D)
dialog: You are so slammin...
text: Kayla raises a brow. Dex looks at his palm and sees smudged
text: ink on it.
speaker_heading: DEX (CONT'D)
dialog: .+-Something with a “K.”
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Kayla.
speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: Riiiiight.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: We don’t have to talk so much.
text: Kayla smiles. Dex nods, appreciatively.
dialog: 31.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: The guys continue driving to the prom. Pete takes a hard
text: turn. Eli slides across the back seat into Hunter. Eli
text: shuffles back to his spot. He looks at Hunter for a moment.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Hey, can you see any reason you can
dialog: see why Julie won’t give me the
dialog: time of day?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Where should I start?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I mean, I know I’m not very macho.
dialog: I'd ask my dad, but he left a while
dialog: back.
text: Hunter feels bad. He wasn’t expecting that response.
text: Eli nods.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Maybe I could... give you some tips.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: You'd do that?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Why not? You kinda remind me of the
dialog: dorks I used to beat up in school.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Cool. I’m a romantic, so I’m good
dialog: there. But if it wasn’t for porn,
dialog: I'd know nothing about sex.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Here’s something: don’t try to kill
dialog: yourself in a girl’s house. For
text: most of them, complete turnoff.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe you just need to relax a bit.
dialog: Be a kid, cut loose. Do something
dialog: unexpected. Chicks like bad boys.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Bad boys, huh?
text: Hunter nods. Eli loosens his tie, undoes his top button and
text: turns to Hunter.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Well, baby steps.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT
text: An elegant facility lit with stunning landscape lighting.
text: Pete’s car flies like a bucking bronco over a speed bump!
text: The car SCREECHES to a halt and the guys hurry to the door.
text: LOUD HIP-HOP MUSIC PUMPS from inside.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Sounds like it’s popping off!
scene_heading: INT. GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: The ballroom is ALMOST EMPTY - a handful of LESS ATTRACTIVE
text: PROM-GOERS and a pair of HANDSY CHAPERONES remain.
text: The Chaperones make out while kids watch. Some STRAGGLER KIDS
text: dance; others including a BOY WITH HORRIBLE ACNE and a KID IN
text: A WHEELCHAIR sit alone at tables, no doubt debating the
text: merits of suicide. The guys meet at the front doors.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
text: No, all the bathrooms are empty.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Wow. Is this the prom for some kind
dialog: of special school?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: No, we're in the right place. The
text: cool kids are gone. The only people
text: left are the drama fags and the
text: regular fags.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (heartfelt)
dialog: Poor bastards... where to next?
speaker_heading: PETE
text: Austin’s house.
speaker_heading: ELI
text: 5721 Haverford Drive.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's where the kids were going
dialog: after the prom.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Let’s go now. This shit might be
dialog: contagious.
text: Pete, feeling bad for the Kids, calls out:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It gets better!!
text: The Boy With Horrible Acne gives Pete a thumbs up.
scene_heading: EXT. 7-11 - NIGHT
text: Seth talks with Austin, Dex and Chad outside the limo.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hundred bucks should do it.
speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: (getting in Seth’s face)
dialog: For a case of Bud?! I'll rip your
dialog: head off-
text: Austin puts out a hand, calming Dex.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (pleading with Seth)
dialog: We’re in high school. We don’t have
dialog: that kind of cash. Come on, Seth.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Don’t “come on” me.
text: The guys laugh. Seth is embarrassed, but brushes it off.
speaker_heading: SETH (CONT’D)
dialog: Look, I’ve got two strikes. I could
dialog: get life for making this purchase.
dialog: So if you want those Buds, daddy’s
dialog: gonna need a hundy.
text: Dex looks like he wants to strangle Seth.
speaker_heading: SETH (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you wanna keep this party
dialog: rolling or not? Because if not,
dialog: maybe I should be dropping these
text: fine young ladies off at home.
dialog: 34.
text: Austin, Dex and Chad share a look, then reach into their
text: wallets.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - LATER
text: The guys fly down a residential street.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: It’s a left here, Pete.
dialog: (as they pass the turn)
dialog: Left!
speaker_heading: PETE
text: Meadow Lane is faster.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: No, it’s slower with all of the
dialog: stop signs. You just cost us five
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Do you have any idea how many times
text: a teenage boy can ejaculate in five
dialog: minutes?!
text: Pete blows a stop sign and a SIREN wails!
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Nice work, Pete.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I knew we shouldn’t have gone this
dialog: way! Did I call it? Did I?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: You called it.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Totally called it!
text: Pete pulls over.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re drunk. And we are totally
dialog: screwed.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I’m not drunk. I had a couple of
dialog: beers.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Tell them you’ve had nothing. Zero
dialog: beers. Deny, deny, deny.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I’m not gonna lie. I’m fine.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I have some gum, Mr. H.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I do, too.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don’t need it.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Act casually and breathe through
dialog: your noses.
text: Mitchell grabs his and Eli’s gum and shoves it in Pete’s
text: mouth. A young Hispanic cop, OFFICER HERNANDEZ, shines his
text: flashlight into the car and leans in.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Good evening, gentlemen.
text: Pete works hard to chew a GIANT WAD OF GUM.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: Officer.
text: The guys all nod hello. Pete hands him his license and
text: registration. Hernandez looks at the documents, then into the
text: car and sees Mitchell and Eli conspicuously tight-lipped.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Have you gentlemen been drinking
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (mouth still full)
dialog: I had a couple beers earlier. But
dialog: as you can see, I’m perfectly fine
dialog: now. So if you don’t mind, just
dialog: write me a ticket and we’ll be on
dialog: our way. We’re in a hurry.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Oh, is that right?
text: Pete nods and continues chewing. Hernandez looks at his fat
text: veteran partner, OFFICER DONOHUE, who shakes his head in
text: disgust. Hernandez gives Pete a hard look.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ (CONT’D)
dialog: Who's the kid?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Just a friend.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: It’s okay, officer. This isn’t a
dialog: Sandusky situation.
dialog: That did not allay Hernandez’s concerns.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Sir, I’m going to ask you to step
text: out of the car.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Why?
text: Hernandez stares at Pete for a moment and puts his hand on
text: his holster.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Because I fucking said so.
text: Hernandez looks at Donohue, who gives him a thumbs up. Pete
text: looks at the guys, worried. He spits out the gum and gets out
text: of the car.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hunter, Mitchell and Eli are all looking out the window of
text: the car as Pete is being given a Breathalyzer test.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Blow, blow, blow, keep blowing!
text: Hernandez looks at the test. Pete blows a .06, below the
text: legal limit. Donohue, who has a snarling GERMAN SHEPHERD at
text: his side, looks disappointed.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (to the guys)
dialog: Point oh six!
text: The guys celebrate in the car - high fives all around. The
text: Cops don’t look pleased.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, thank you officers.
dialog: Sincerely. You know, I thought
dialog: about being a cop myself, but then
dialog: I-
dialog: (regretting it as the
dialog: words come out)
dialog: -got into college.
dialog: 37.
text: Donohue turns to Hernandez. They both look pissed.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: Oh, wow. College boy, huh? Color us
dialog: impressed.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, that came out wrong. I just-
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: You know, I haven’t calibrated the
dialog: Breathalyzer recently. We better
dialog: conduct a field sobriety test.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Guys, please, don’t do this.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Nah, let’s just take him in. Get a
dialog: blood test, just to be safe.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Let's do the field sobriety test,
dialog: okay? What do you need me to do?
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: How about some running in place?
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Yeah, let’s see some of that.
text: The Cops share a smirk. Grizzly barks at Pete as he runs in
dialog: place.
scene_heading: INT. PETE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mitchell, Hunter and Eli sit in the car.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: What the fuck is going on out
dialog: there?
text: REVEAL Pete doing squat thrusts.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: We're losing valuable time while
text: Pete’s blasting his quads!
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: This is like a horror movie. It’s
text: the Prom Night Hymen Massacre.
text: Eli checks his cell phone, then yells out the window:
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Not for nothing, Mr. Harrington,
dialog: but Austin’s house has five
dialog: bedrooms. I Zillowed it!
text: ON PETE, who shakes his head in frustration and stops the
text: squat thrusts.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Alright, guys. I think we’re done
dialog: here. I’m sober and pretty sweaty.
text: Suddenly, Donohue takes a defensive stance and quickly moves
text: his right hip away from Pete.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: Whoa, hey, buddy! Stay back!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What?
text: Pete hasn’t moved and looks confused.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: (to Hernandez)
dialog: You see this guy just make a move
dialog: for my sidearm?!
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: Oh, yeah! Totally saw that! Your
text: sidearm. He made a move.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: College boy’s going to matriculate
dialog: downtown. I’1l load Grizzly. You
dialog: cuff his ass!
text: Hernandez grabs Pete as Donohue walks the dog to the Cruiser.
text: After a beat of hesitation, Pete SHOVES HERNANDEZ TO THE
text: GROUND and sprints to his car!
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: We’ve got a runner!!!
text: SCREECH!!! Donohue turns to see that Pete has peeled out!
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: Holy fuck!
text: Hernandez gets up. He and Donohue look dazed, not knowing how
text: to respond. After a beat, they hop in the Cruiser and take
text: off after the guys.
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: INT. PETE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: The guys are STUNNED as Pete flies down the road.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What the hell are you doing?!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We were going to be there all
dialog: night! We have very little time to
dialog: find the girls.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: He’s right, they were fucking with
dialog: him! I’ve never done the running
text: man during a sobriety check.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: They have your license! We’re all
dialog: going to jail!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I know, but what choice did I have?!
text: Pete spots the Cruiser in his rear view, lights flashing and
text: sirens blaring. Pete cranks the wheel hard and turns.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Pull over! Marcie’s never gonna let
dialog: me hang out with you guys again!
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: If anyone survives, tell Julie I
dialog: loved her and I will live in her
dialog: room when I’m a ghost!
text: Pete makes another sharp turn.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I’m not pulling over. If any of you
dialog: want out, I’1l slow down and you
dialog: can jump.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Then I don’t get to bang Debbie and
dialog: the dream dies. Fuck that!
text: Hunter starts pounding the ceiling of the car with his hand.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Yeah, keep hope alive!
dialog: 40.
text: Eli starts banging the ceiling, too. Mitchell, somewhat more
text: reluctantly, joins in. Pete makes a series of hard turns,
text: then pulls into a random driveway and kills the lights.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Get down!
text: Everyone ducks in the car and a moment later, the police
text: cruiser flies by down the street!
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Cops look down each street as they drive by.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Goddammit!
text: Donohue punches the steering wheel.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: Where the fuck do they think
dialog: they’re going? We have the guy’s
dialog: information.
text: Donohue holds Pete’s driver's license. Hernandez shrugs.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, I expect stupid shit like
dialog: that from my son, but those were
dialog: grown ass men!
scene_heading: INT. PETE’S CAR —- MOMENTS LATER
text: Pete and the guys sit up in the car.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Wow!
text: The guys laugh nervously, surprised they've gotten away.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I know we’re fucked and we’re going
dialog: to be arrested, but by then, our
dialog: daughters will be home.
text: The guys nod. Pete backs out of the driveway, hits the lights
text: and heads the other way.
scene_heading: EXT. AUSTIN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Pete pulls his car in front of Austin’s house.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
text: I don’t hear a party going on.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Me either.
text: The guys hurry up to the house. Eli runs to a bay window and
text: looks in.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Julie, no! You whore! You fucking
dialog: whore... I loved you!
text: Pete, Mitchell and Hunter run over and looks in. Inside, they
text: see a GUY in a tuxedo plowing a GIRL with a RED PROM DRESS
text: hiked up. Her legs are in the air.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We're too late!
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (to Mitchell)
dialog: Alright, Julie’s cherry is busted,
dialog: but Sam and Kayla could still be
text: intact.
speaker_heading: ELI
text: Wait, Austin’s not balding.
text: The MAN now leans back and the guys can see it’s not Austin.
text: It’s RON, 45, boning his WIFE.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, thank god. It’s just Austin’s
dialog: parents.
text: Ron continues pumping until he makes a hideous o-face. The
dialog: guys recoil in horror!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
text: He was looking at me when he
dialog: finished.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Shit, you know what that means...
dialog: his load is in your soul.
text: Eli looks at Hunter, are you serious? Hunter shakes his head,
text: nah. Eli smiles and fist bumps Hunter. Pete bangs on the door
text: and a winded Ron opens it.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Hey fellas. What’s up?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Where are the girls, Ron?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Come in.
text: The guys step inside. Ron’s Wife covers herself. Hunter nods
text: a hello at her. She smiles shyly and quickly heads upstairs.
speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, you got me. Guilty as
text: charged. The kids aren’t here.
text: The guys are stunned.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What the hell’s going on here?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Just a little prom night role play.
dialog: Keeping the spark alive. You guys
dialog: made it an exciting ending.
dialog: (to Mitchell)
dialog: Especially you. When we locked eyes
dialog: as I climaxed? Intense, right!?
text: Mitchell looks sick.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: That's fucking gross, Ron.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Where are the girls?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Who wants a glass of pinot?
text: Eli raises a hand.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You lied about throwing a post-prom
dialog: party? You called me to go over the
dialog: snack list to make sure it was okay
text: with Julie’s allergies.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Hey, had to sell it, right?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You were so specific. Teriyaki-
dialog: glazed beef jerky?
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Look, the kids just wanted to have
dialog: some harmless fun without parents
dialog: bothering them. It’s prom. So don’t
dialog: bother them, okay?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: One of you guys is gonna hit him,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Can we go? It smells like semen in
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (to Ron)
dialog: Where’d they go?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I don’t know. But they’1ll be back
dialog: late tonight. Safe and sound.
text: Pete shakes his head and turns to leave with the guys in tow.
speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: Pete, hold up.
text: Pete turns as the guys walk out.
dialog: Long beat.
speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you so worried about?
dialog: Austin is a good kid. You know
dialog: that. And there is no way that
text: Austin is having sex with Julie
dialog: tonight...
speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: -+. without a condom. I told him
dialog: how important it is to wear one.
text: Pete heads for the door and spots something on the table.
text: It’s a CONDOM. Pete picks it up and shows Ron.
speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: You know, I did mention how much
dialog: better it feels without one. That's
dialog: my bad.
text: Pete storms out.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: There’s no disputing that!
scene_heading: EXT. LIMO - NIGHT
text: The limo is parked at the side of the busy highway. Passing
text: cars HONK as the boys laugh while they piss on some bushes.
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS
text: Julie, Kayla and Sam sip beer in the back of the limo.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: At first I didn’t like beer. But
text: with each sip, it gets less gross.
text: She takes another big sip.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (wincing)
dialog: So good!
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I can’t get enough of the stuff.
text: She takes a long swig, clearly hating it. Sam takes a long
text: chug; Kayla matches it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Want some, Julie? It’s the best
dialog: thing I’ve ever tasted.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No, beer tastes awful.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Totally wrong.
text: Sam nods. They each swig again.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I can’t wait to get with Chad. I’m
dialog: gonna bounce on him like a yoga
dialog: ball.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I am going to ride Dex like I’m
text: trying to saw it off.
text: Julie shakes her head, disgusted.
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: INT. PETE’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Pete drives into town, no one saying a word.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: What’s the plan, Pete? We can’t
text: just drive around aimlessly all
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Should we check the hospitals and
dialog: morgues?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Oh my god, they could be dead!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: They’re not dead.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: You're right. I’m sorry.
text: Mitchell takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Can we make a quick stop at Mickey
dialog: Dees? I think the fumes are
dialog: affecting me.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We’re on a mission here, Eli. We
dialog: don’t have time-
speaker_heading: HUNTER
text: Just hit the drive-through, Pete.
dialog: We have no plan and the kid needs
dialog: sugar.
text: Pete sighs and turns into the McDonald’s drive-through.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: We're all frustrated. Let’s just
dialog: crush a McFlurry and get our heads
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: ELI
text: It’s vanilla ice cream mixed with
text: Oreos. Julie turned me onto them.
dialog: They're terrific.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (to Eli)
dialog: Order me up one of those bad boys,
dialog: too. Extra large, playa.
text: Eli nods. Fist bump, then Eli zips his window down.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Do you want me to ask if they’re
dialog: hiring, Mr. Forde?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Fuck you very much, Eli.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
text: He’s only trying to help.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: You're right. Sorry, Eli... Ask if
dialog: they offer dental.
text: Eli nods.
speaker_heading: MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE (0.S.)
dialog: Welcome to McDonald’s. Can I take
dialog: your order?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Yes, thanks. We’d like-
text: Through the glass, Pete spots Julie hanging out of the limo
text: at the drive-through pick-up window.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Holy shit, it’s Julie! There they
dialog: are!
text: The guys see Julie grabbing the food (including a McFlurry)
text: and disappearing back into the limo.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Told you she loves the McFlurry!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Get over there, Pete!
text: Pete nails the gas, then slams the brakes -- there’s a car
text: two feet in front of them. He puts it in reverse, but there’s
text: a car right behind them. There’s nowhere to go!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We're trapped!
text: The girls’ limo leaves the McDonald's.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: They're getting away!
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Austin will probably use the
text: McFlurry to stimulate her nipples.
text: Hunter nods, definitely. Pete fumes and turns the wheel hard.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hang on!
text: He punches the gas and the car climbs up the curb and tears
text: into the bushes lining the drive-through.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Fuck yeah, Mr. H!
text: Bush debris flies all over the crowded parking lot and
text: CUSTOMERS dive out of the way of the car! Finally free of the
text: line, Pete fishtails onto the road.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: They were headed toward Atlantic!
text: Pete makes another sharp turn. Mitchell spots the limo.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: There. That’s them!
text: Pete floors it. The shitty car shakes like a bastard as he
text: weaves in and out of traffic.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (re: the car)
dialog: Christ, this thing’s a pile of
dialog: shit. Time for a new car, dude.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (sensitively)
dialog: You do spend an awful lot of time
text: repairing it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: This was Jessica’s car.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: We know, man. We understand.
text: Pete nods.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: But you’ve gotta move on. If you
dialog: worked that widower angle properly,
dialog: you could be blowing your bag all
text: over town.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Can we discuss this later?!
text: Pete finally catches up to the limo. Its windows are tinted
text: completely black. The guys can’t see in.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're sure that’s them?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I’m positive. I remember the
dialog: license plate.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
text: Pull up next to it.
text: Pete pulls up beside the limo. Hunter yells out the window:
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Pull the fucking limo over NOW!
text: Pete honks the horn. The limo accelerates!
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s this driver doing?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I had a bad feeling about him when
dialog: he fleeced me for an extra ten
dialog: bucks!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: He took me for fifty!
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: You fell for that shit?
text: The limo cranks a hard turn, desperate to lose the guys.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What the hell?!
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: He’s taking evasive maneuvers!
text: Pete follows, gaining on the limo. The limo suddenly takes an
text: impossible right turn, but can’t make it.
dialog: 49.
text: It clips the curb at a high rate of speed, and flips on its
text: side, scraping along the street, shooting sparks for 50
dialog: feet!!
text: The limo heads toward a BOWLING ALLEY, where a sign
text: displaying TEN BOWLING PINS sit atop two posts. The limo
text: slides between the posts, taking out eight of the pins, but
text: leaving the dreaded 7-10 split.
text: The guys look on in HORROR.
speaker_heading: PETE
speaker_heading: JULIE!
text: Mitchell is frozen in the car. Pete, Eli and Hunter hop out
dialog: and race to the limo!
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please be okay!
text: Pete and Hunter climb up the car and reach the door, which is
text: badly dented. They struggle to open the door. Finally, a
text: BRIDE and GROOM pop out of the sunroof.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s okay! It’s not the girls! It’s
dialog: just some newlyweds.
scene_heading: IN PETE’S CAR...
text: Mitchell exhales, relieved.
text: AT THE LIMO...
text: The guys help the couple out.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the couple)
dialog: Congratulations!
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Great dress!
text: ON HUNTER...
text: .-+.- who helps the Limo Driver out.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (to the Limo Driver)
dialog: Why didn’t you just pull over,
dialog: man?!
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: LIMO DRIVER
dialog: Would you pull over when a bunch of
text: aggro assholes in a hoopdie are
dialog: screaming and waving at you?
text: Hunter nods, good point. He hurries back to Pete and Eli, who
text: talk to the couple but are backing up toward Pete’s car.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Let’s roll!
speaker_heading: GROOM
dialog: (to Pete and Eli)
dialog: Some bumps and bruises, but we’re
dialog: okay. God must have been looking
dialog: over us because-
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We get the idea! Sorry!
text: The guys hustle into the car and SCREECH, they take off! The
text: couple eats exhaust.
speaker_heading: BRIDE
dialog: Do you think your mother had
dialog: something to do with this?
speaker_heading: GROOM
dialog: Don’t be ridiculous.
text: The Bride looks unconvinced.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: At the scene of the limo, a few POLICEMEN and PARAMEDICS
text: surround the area. The Cops look at the totaled limo.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Lucky they walked away from this
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: Yeah, they've got a big night of
text: boning ahead of them.
text: Hernandez nods, excitedly. Donohue turns serious.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s off the record.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: Did you catch the description?
dialog: Sounds like our skells.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: Yeah, exactly.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: You believe the size of the scrotes
dialog: on these guys?
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
text: Felony evading, reckless driving,
dialog: maybe attempted vehicular homicide?
dialog: Gigantic scrotes!
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: We nail them, we make detective for
dialog: sure.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: It'd be nice not to have to pick up
text: dog shit at work.
text: Donohue nods. They climb back into their cruiser.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER
text: Pete gasses up the car. The guys stand around.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (glaring at Mitchell)
dialog: “Definitely their limo?"
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: There was definitely a six in the
dialog: license plate!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: This really sucks.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Hey, at least your girls are with
text: decent kids. Kayla’s date has VD
text: written all over him.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Yeah, I wouldn’t be surprised if
dialog: that kid has the hiv.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Oh my god, you’re right. I didn’t
dialog: even think of that.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Kayla’s gonna get AIDS. And not
dialog: Magic Johnson AIDS. The bad kind.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Hey, I have an idea.
text: Eli whips out his phone and goes online. He navigates to
scene_heading: SILVER BACK’S home page.
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Check it out!
text: CLOSE ON the web page: Two HUGE GORILLAS growl angrily at
text: each other, then one mounts the other and they bang
text: aggressively to a techno track.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: That’s disturbing.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Why would you show us that? I am
dialog: not into it.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: No, look! The girls aren't
dialog: answering their cells, right?
text: He points to the bottom of the page, which reads “To book,
text: call Silver Back’s cell directly.” The guys exchange looks,
text: then Mitchell quickly dials.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: It’s ringing!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Put it on speaker.
text: Mitchell hits the speaker button.
speaker_heading: DEX'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: And... Go.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Dex?
speaker_heading: DEX'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: Silver Back?
speaker_heading: DEX'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Go for Silver Back.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
text: It’s Mitchell. Kayla’s dad.
speaker_heading: DEX'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Katie's dad.
speaker_heading: DEX'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, okay. What do you want?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Listen, we're looking for the
dialog: girls.
speaker_heading: DEX'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I’m gonna be straight with you. The
dialog: girls are young and vulnerable and
text: going through a rebellious stage,
dialog: so they signed a pact to have sex
dialog: with you guys tonight.
text: Pete, Hunter and Eli look like they could kill him. What the
dialog: fuck are you doing?!
speaker_heading: CLICK.
speaker_heading: DEX'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Thanks for the heads up!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Sure thing. We just need to know
dialog: where you are. Hello?
dialog: (turns to guys)
dialog: Ahh, must’ve lost him. Fucking T-
dialog: Mobile.
text: The guys can’t believe it. Eli turns to Pete and Hunter.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: One of you guys is gonna hit him,
dialog: right?
scene_heading: INT. PETE’S CAR - LATER
text: Pete drives around aimlessly. Everyone is silent... worried.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (to Hunter)
dialog: I had a beautiful evening planned
dialog: for Julie’s first time.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Here we go...
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: There's a cozy little inn at the
text: end of Dune Road in Montauk. It’s
text: off the beaten path, beyond the
dialog: glitz and shallowness of the
dialog: Hamptons. It’s nearly a hundred
text: years old. It has a wrap-around
text: porch overlooking the Atlantic.
dialog: Julie and I would stay there on the
dialog: night we agreed that our love for
dialog: one another was eternal. We’d walk
text: along the beach after a romantic
dialog: dinner, then back in our room, I’d
dialog: light a dozen candles and que up
dialog: Michael Buble’s “Come Fly With Me” -
dialog: - disc one, of course.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Gotta go disc one.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Then we'd kiss passionately for a
text: while as we bathed in the claw-foot
text: tub, then climb into bed and once
dialog: again proclaim our love, only this
dialog: time allowing our genitals to do
text: the talking.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: More than enough. Thank you, Eli.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Indulge me, Mr. H. The fantasy is
text: all that remains. Following a few
dialog: hours of love-making, we’d sit out
text: on the balcony overlooking the
dialog: lighthouse. Julie would rehydrate
dialog: with a Gatorade as I massaged her
text: feet. We'd sit there in silence,
dialog: content, and listen to the waves
text: crashing on the beach. And perhaps,
dialog: should it be the right time of
dialog: year, we'd be serenaded by the
text: migrating whales singing not far
dialog: off shore.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: That sounds nice.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: It really does.
text: Eli nods and wipes away a tear...
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: A little later, round two. Maybe
dialog: reverse cowgirl. That looks fun.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: It’s fantastic.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Look, Eli, we’re running out of
dialog: time. You know how these kids
dialog: think. Where could they be?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I wouldn’t know. I’m not cool.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Don’t sell yourself short. You’ve
dialog: got potential. And you’re our best
text: shot at finding them.
text: Eli thinks about it.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Maybe Tina would know...
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (of course!)
dialog: Tina, right!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Who's Tina?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Seriously, Hunter? She was one of
text: Julie’s and Sam’s best friends.
text: Hunter shrugs.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT’D)
dialog: She's a really nice girl. They were
dialog: always together until...
dialog: (glancing at Mitchell)
dialog: «.. recently.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What?
text: Eli nods.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Nothing. It’s just that she used to
dialog: come around a lot more. I got the
dialog: idea that Kayla didn’t like Tina
dialog: anymore, then I noticed that Tina
dialog: stopped coming around.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So... I think Kayla’s a bad
dialog: influence.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Kayla is?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, don’t look so surprised. I
dialog: mean, I’m sure this pact was all
dialog: her idea.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Kayla’s idea?! How the hell would
dialog: you know that? They all signed it!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It was Kayla’s handwriting! And you
dialog: saw what she was wearing tonight!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What’s wrong with her dress?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Dress? I thought it was a belt.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: He’s got a point, Mitchell. Kayla
dialog: seems way more sexually advanced
dialog: than Julie or Sam.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Oh, right, like Sam wouldn’t know
dialog: anything about sex? You should have
dialog: a turnstile on your bedroom door!
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Hate the game, bro.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I’1ll have you know that Kayla was a
dialog: girl scout!
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: She was a girl scout, so she
dialog: couldn't be promiscuous?!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Well, she’s a virgin isn’t she!?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I know. That’s the most shocking
dialog: part of this whole fucking night!
text: Mitchell shoots a death glare at Pete.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (to Eli)
dialog: Girl scouts are usually pretty
dialog: easy. I finger blasted so many girl
dialog: scouts when I was a kid that my
text: pinky still smells like thin mints.
text: Eli’s jaw drops.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Just drive, Pete!
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - NIGHT
text: Austin makes out with Julie. Sam, a bit tipsy, looks over at
text: Kayla, then rubs Chad’s thigh. Chad’s eyes, among other
text: things, grow huge. He laughs nervously.
text: Kayla, also tipsy, leans over and rubs Dex’s leg. He slides
text: forward, which moves her hand on his crotch. She quickly
text: removes her hand and he laughs.
scene_heading: EXT. TINA’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The house is dark. Not a single light is on. Pete’s car pulls
text: up in front of the house.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
text: Looks like they’re asleep.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (still annoyed)
dialog: Really? In the total darkness at
dialog: night? You think?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Fuck off, Pete.
dialog: 58.
text: Before the guys can get out of the car, Eli is out and
text: climbing a tree in the front yard. Pete gets out and hurries
text: over to him.
scene_heading: EXT. TINA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Pete looks up at Eli.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: This is the quickest way to Tina’s
text: room. Her window is open. I’1l stop
dialog: at nothing to preserve Julie’s
dialog: hymen.
text: Pete climbs up the tree behind Eli.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Stop saying hymen.
scene_heading: INT. TINA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: The room is lit by moonlight. Eli slips in the open window
text: and sits on the bed. He shakes Tina, who is passed out.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Hey Tina. Are you sleeping?
text: TINA is 15, but looks younger in her sleep gear and retainer,
text: which makes her lisp.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: What the fuckf are you doing in my
dialog: froomf?
text: She grabs a TROPHY from her night stand and wields it like a
dialog: weapon.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Tina, it’s me. Eli. From Mr.
dialog: Cristofel’s art class. How are you?
speaker_heading: TINA

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I will bash your fucking skull.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Better. Much more menacing!
text: Pete taps at the glass. Tina sees Pete in the window.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Mr. Harrington? What’s going on?
text: Pete climbs inside the window and gets a full view of Tina,
dialog: who is very PREGNANT.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, wow. I didn’t know you were-
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Yeah, Julie didn’t want you to
dialog: know.
text: Pete sighs.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Look, Julie’s getting in over her
dialog: head tonight and I’m trying to find
dialog: her. Do you know where they were
dialog: going after the prom?
text: Tina looks hesitant.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Please, Tina! Help us save Julie
dialog: from this...
dialog: (staring at her belly)
dialog: ... huge mistake.
text: Tina looks offended.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I’m sorry, Mr. Harrington. I’d help
dialog: if I could. You’re an awesome dad.
dialog: But I don’t know where they were
dialog: going.
text: Pete nods, disappointed.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Okay, thanks.
text: They turn back to the window, then Pete turns back to her.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT’D)
dialog: You know, Tina, if you ever need
dialog: any help...
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Oh, no, we're gonna be fine.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Oh, the father is still in the
dialog: picture?
speaker_heading: TROY (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah, still here.
text: TROY (18, goofy), BUCK NAKED, springs out of bed. Pete and
text: Eli get a full frontal view. Pete reels backward and knocks
text: over a lamp, which falls with a loud CRASH!
speaker_heading: TINA'S DAD (0.S.)
dialog: (shouting, enraged)
dialog: If he’s here again, I’M GONNA KILL
speaker_heading: HIM!
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Everyone should probably leave now.
text: Troy, Pete and Eli scramble out the window as TINA’S DAD
text: bursts in swinging a BASEBALL BAT!
speaker_heading: TINA’S DAD
dialog: Nobody runs a train on my daughter!
text: The most experienced, Troy is first out the window. Tina’s
text: dad takes a swing as Pete and Eli dive out the window and
dialog: onto...
scene_heading: EXT. TINA’S HOUSE, ROOF -— CONTINUOUS
text: Troy jumps onto a tree branch, then hangs and drops safely to
text: the ground. Pete and Eli get to the edge of the roof as
text: Tina’s Dad swings his bat.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Go, go, go!
text: Pete and Eli inexplicably hold hands as they jump off the
text: roof! They grab the branch, then smile at each other,
dialog: relieved.
dialog: 61.
text: CRACK! The branch snaps under their weight. They crash down
text: into a bush.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Fuck, that hurts!
text: They race to the car. Pete turns the key, but the car won’t
dialog: start!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATER
text: The two Cops are parked eating a late dinner. Hernandez
text: passes a piece of burrito to Grizzly, who wolfs it down.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: No, don’t give him jalapenos. It
dialog: gives him crazy gas!
text: Hernandez looks apologetic. A call comes in:
speaker_heading: RADIO (0.S.)
dialog: Sexual assault by multiple male
dialog: suspects of an underage girl. 732
text: Stuyvesant Avenue. Suspects fled in
text: a blue Volvo station wagon.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: That’s our guys!
dialog: (on radio)
dialog: 324. Show us responding.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: They're escalating!
text: Donohue nods. He flips on the siren, whips the car around and
text: heads toward Tina’s house.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: SIREN BLARING, the police car zips by Pete’s car, which
text: slowly heads in the opposite direction. The cops see it’s
text: being pushed by Hunter, Mitchell, Eli and a still-naked Troy.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: That was them!
text: Donohue spins the car around in a hard 180!
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: You thinking what I’m thinking?
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Grizzly?!
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: Turn him loose!
text: Hernandez pops the door and Grizzly, the angry German
text: Shepherd, takes off after the guys! Donohue and Hernandez
text: give chase, too.
text: ON PETE...
text: +. who waits for the car to gain speed.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: A little faster guys!
text: The guys push with everything they have as Grizzly quickly
text: approaches! 35 feet. 25 feet. 15 feet!
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Holy shit! The fucking dog is
dialog: almost on us!
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: My genitals are exposed!
text: Pete cranks the engine and it turns over!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Okay, get in!
text: The guys race to the open doors and jump in. Grizzly takes a
text: swipe and bites Mitchell’s leg! Mitchell pulls with all he’s
text: got and gets free, but the dog rips off a chunk of his pants!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: My capris!
scene_heading: INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: ON PETE as he drives. He hears the guys gasping for breath in
text: the back seat.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (0.S.)
dialog: I can’t believe this.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I know. She probably won’t even
dialog: finish high school.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Her poor dad...
text: The guys ride in stunned silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: So, uh, Pete, are you gonna
dialog: introduce us to your friend?
speaker_heading: PETE
text: That's Troy, Tina’s boyfriend.
text: REVEAL: Troy, still naked, sitting on Mitchell’s lap.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Hey dudes.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Stop shifting.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I know where they went after the
dialog: prom. Austin’s my boy. Give me a
dialog: ride home and I'll tell you. Cool?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Yeah, cool.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: He said they were headed down to
text: the piers by Battery Park.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Battery Park? They’re going into
dialog: the city?
text: Troy nods. The dads look VERY WORRIED.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
text: Troy stands on a corner, still naked, as Pete’s car peels out.
speaker_heading: TROY
dialog: Hey, we had a deal!
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT
text: The Cops load Grizzly back into the car, frustrated.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
dialog: What the hell are these guys into
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: Pretty obvious. Sex trafficking.
text: Hernandez nods. The guys suddenly catch a whiff of something
text: and make a disgusted face.
speaker_heading: DONOHUE (CONT'D)
dialog: You see? The jalapenos!
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT
text: The incomparable NYC skyline glows brightly on this clear
dialog: night.
scene_heading: INT. PETE’S CAR —- MOMENTS LATER
text: Pete flies down the FDR toward Battery Park. The guys look
text: out the windows, concern growing on their faces.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: I can’t believe the kids are in the
dialog: city alone. Don’t they know how
dialog: dangerous this place is?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Word is, Kayla’s into the Saturday
text: night rave scene downtown.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
text: She is not. She goes to Pete’s
dialog: house on Saturday nights. She and
dialog: Julie take guitar lessons.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Uh, no.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No. Julie told me that she and
dialog: Kayla were taking guitar lessons at
dialog: your house on Saturday nights.
text: Pete and Mitchell are stewing.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Great. That means Sam is mixed up
dialog: in whatever the hell they’re doing
dialog: on Saturday nights, too.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Nah, they don’t hang out with Sam.
text: Hunter looks surprised as Pete and Mitchell share a look.
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
text: Julie goes to Austin’s place on
dialog: Saturday nights.
text: Pete looks at Eli.
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: (reluctantly admitting)
dialog: I've followed her a bunch of times.
text: Pete’s not sure whether to be happy or angry about that.
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s okay, Mr. H. I have binoculars
dialog: and to my knowledge, nothing other
dialog: than light to moderate petting has
dialog: occurred.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Wait, what do you mean they don’t
dialog: hang out with Sam?
speaker_heading: ELI
text: Kayla doesn’t like Sam. Julie still
text: does, but Sam’s not in the crew
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: She’s not in the crew? Is it... is
dialog: it drugs?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: No. She hangs with the art freaks
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Art freaks?
text: Eli nods. Hunter is floored.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Why couldn't it have been drugs?
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: It all happened during spring
dialog: break. She didn’t tell you?
text: Hunter shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
text: Pink streak in her hair. Dead
dialog: giveaway.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (to Mitchell)
dialog: What the fuck? Kayla is too good
dialog: for Sam? Give me a fucking break.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: It has nothing to do with us,
dialog: Hunter. I feel really bad about it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Me, too...
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: You knew about this, too?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yeah, I assumed you knew until you
dialog: said something about the girls in
dialog: karate class. They haven’t done
dialog: that in years.
text: Hunter sighs.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, man. I thought it was
dialog: obvious that something was wrong
text: with her.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: I didn’t even notice...
text: Hunter sits back, feeling terrible...
scene_heading: EXT. BATTERY PARK AREA - NIGHT
text: The guys walk around the piers along New York Harbor. Drunk
text: and stoned KIDS are everywhere.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: We're never gonna find them down
dialog: here.
text: They spot some PROSTITUTES on the corner.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Maybe they’ve seen the girls.
text: The guys head over.
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE #1
dialog: Hey handsome, you want a date?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, thanks. But maybe you ladies
dialog: can help us.
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE #2
dialog: I’m sure we can, sugar!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Great. We're looking for some young
dialog: girls.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Fifteen year olds.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Very cute.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
text: Two brunettes and a blonde.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: The blonde is mine.
text: The Prostitutes look at each other with disgust, then one
text: whips out a GUN and the other a BATON! A POLICE SIREN WAILS
text: as a POLICE CAR flies around the corner and blasts its HIGH
dialog: BEAMS on the terrified guys!
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
text: ON THE GROUND, SCUMBAGS! !
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, you don’t underst-
text: She CRACKS Pete behind the knees with the baton and he drops
text: like a sack of shit. The UNDERCOVER COPS cuff the guys.
text: Just then, the kids’ limo pulls up.
text: ON THE KIDS...
text: As they file out of the limo, they spot the guys laying on
text: their bellies on the pavement, getting cuffed. They’re not
text: close, so they don’t recognize them.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What a bunch of losers.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Perverts!
text: The kids walk down a pier over which hangs a banner that
text: reads “BOOZE CRUISE AROUND THE STATUE OF LIBERTY!”
text: Austin steps across the gap and onto the boat. He helps Julie
text: cross onto the boat. Dex hops on next and heads inside.
text: Austin helps Kayla and Sam aboard.
speaker_heading: KAYLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks, Austin.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Of course.
text: ON THE GUYS...
text: .+. Who spot the girls, but it’s too late as the kids board a
scene_heading: PARTY BOAT.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATER
text: Mitchell, Hunter and Eli are handcuffed, leaning against a
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I guess you’ll never get to play
text: with Debbie’s pom poms now.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: I don’t give a shit about Debbie.
dialog: I’m worried about Sam.
text: One of the female UNDERCOVER COPS walks over.
speaker_heading: UNDERCOVER COP
dialog: So let me get this straight, you’re
dialog: two of the girls’ fathers?
dialog: (off their nods; to Eli)
dialog: And who are you again?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I’m the neighbor slash love
dialog: interest.
text: Mitchell raises his cuffed hand.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Question. Are you currently hiring?
dialog: I feel as though I could be a real
dialog: asset to the force.
speaker_heading: UNDERCOVER COP
dialog: (looks him up and down)
dialog: I don't see it.
text: ON PETE, who speaks with MAYA, one of the undercover cops
text: dressed as a prostitute. She’s very attractive. Maya pops the
text: cuffs off and Pete rubs his wrist.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Thanks for not taking us in. I’m
dialog: just trying to do the right thing
dialog: here.
dialog: (struggling to maintain
dialog: his composure)
dialog: Sorry, It’s been a long night.
text: Pete drops his head. Maya pats his arm.
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I’m a single parent with a
dialog: teenager, too, so I know how tough
dialog: it can be. Cut yourself some slack.
text: They share a smile.
scene_heading: ON ELI AND HUNTER:
text: Eli gestures to Pete and Maya.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Check it. That hot lady cop is into
dialog: Mr. H.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Too bad he won’t do anything about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: What should he do?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
text: She's throwing off serious signals.
dialog: Now’s the time to break the spacial
text: barrier. Touch her. Gently, but in
dialog: a firm way. Something that says
dialog: “I'm here for you. I care deeply.
dialog: My cock is here with us, too.”
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: He’s not doing any of that.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: No, there’s no room in his life for
dialog: anyone but Julie.
text: ON PETE AND MAYA as the other guys and the other Undercover
dialog: Cop walk over:
speaker_heading: MAYA
dialog: I live right near you. Take my
dialog: card. If there’s anything I can do.
dialog: Or if you just want to...
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: ++. call me sometime.
text: She smiles. Pete smiles back. There’s real chemistry here.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I‘d really like-
speaker_heading: UNDERCOVER COP
dialog: Apologies for the beat down, but
dialog: this area is full of scumbags just
dialog: waiting to get their filthy hands
text: on young, naive girls so they can
dialog: get them hooked on drugs and turn
dialog: ‘em out. Next thing you know, these
text: poor girls are so strung out on
dialog: crank, they can’t keep track of
dialog: which veins still work or whose
dialog: dicks they're sucking.
text: Pete and Maya’s nice moment has been decimated.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: On that note...
text: Maya nods.
scene_heading: EXT. PIER - MOMENTS LATER
text: The guys look out at several PARTY BOATS in the harbor.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We’re gonna need a boat.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: There!
text: The guys hurry toward a dock with several boats.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: So, Mr. Harrington, did you get
dialog: that chick’s math or what?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Give it up, Pete. It was so
text: obvious. She took forever patting
dialog: you down.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: You should tear that ass up!
text: Fist bump with Hunter.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Eli, some guys will have sex with
dialog: any woman who comes along. Others
dialog: of us want to be in love first.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: And that’s why Mitchell’s only had
dialog: sex with two women.
text: Mitchell offers no rebuttal.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: My only frame of reference is porn.
dialog: But is sex really different when
dialog: you're in love?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yes, Eli. It is.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: I'd like to disagree, but the truth
dialog: is, I can’t. I remember the first
dialog: time I made love to my wife. It
dialog: felt like an earthquake. I can’t
dialog: even put it into words. It’s a
dialog: beautiful memory.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: I still beat off to it sometimes.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Wow, that sounds amazing.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: It really was...
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: How many times did you cum in her
dialog: face?
scene_heading: INT. BOAT - NIGHT
text: A post-prom booze cruise is raging as it cruises toward the

text: She smiles. He kisses Julie’s neck, but she’s distracted. She
text: watches Sam downing beers from plastic cups.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Drink up, you fucking losers!
text: Everyone around her cheers and drinks. Kayla throws back a
text: beer, overwhelmed by Sam’s pace.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Be right back.
text: Austin grabs her gently and whispers in her ear.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: I have a huge boner right now.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That’s sweet.

speaker_heading: JULIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey guys. Fun, huh?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Um, yes.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Amazing.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Are you okay, Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, I’m great.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Maybe you should slow down.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Maybe you should speed up.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I gotta piss.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, me three.
text: Kayla and Sam walk away, leaving Julie standing there looking
dialog: concerned.
scene_heading: INT. BOAT - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is that the line for the crapper?
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck. That.
text: Sam heads back outside. Curious, Kayla follows.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kayla laughs while standing near the bow of the boat, which

speaker_heading: SAM (0.S.)

dialog: I'm the king of the world!
text: REVEAL Sam sitting over the BOAT RAILING, pissing.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold my leg, bitch!
text: Kayla, still laughing, grabs Sam’s leg. Julie hurries out and
text: grabs Sam’s other leg.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Sam, get down!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Lady Liberty fought for my right to
dialog: do this!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (off Julie’s confused
dialog: look)
dialog: Make yourself useful, Julie. Hand
dialog: me that cocktail napkin.
text: Julie hands her a napkin from under a BEER CUP on the
text: railing. Sam takes care of business and hops down.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Kayla)
dialog: Alright, I'll help you, then we get
dialog: back to the guys. Cuz’ we gotsta’
dialog: get some dick tonight.
text: Julie looks at Kayla, who looks out over the railing.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t tell me you’re scared.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Then go!
text: Kayla can’t back down now. She climbs up.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm letting you go overboard if you
dialog: shit.
text: Julie looks even more concerned.
scene_heading: EXT. PIER - NIGHT
text: The guys walk along the pier, looking for a boat.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: That one!
text: Eli points to a GLEAMING SPEEDBOAT.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Yes, that’s exactly what we need.
dialog: We can speed out there in no time
dialog: and do it in style.
text: Pete and Mitchell nod. They see a GUY next to the boat and
text: the hurry out to him.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 75.
text: The Guy looks over.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT’D)
dialog: We're in a bit of a bind and need a
dialog: boat. Would you rent us yours?
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: She's my pride and joy. I would
dialog: never rent her.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We have cash.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I'm listening.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How does a hundred bucks sound?
text: Guy lifts his leg and lets out a growler of a FART. His point
text: has been made. Smellily.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sounds like a hundred won’t cut it,
dialog: guys.
text: The guys dig into their wallets and add up what they’ve got.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: We've got four hundred and seventy
dialog: two bucks.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Deal. But you have to be careful on
dialog: the motor. She’s real sensitive.
text: Hunter hands the Guy the cash. The guys excitedly climb into
text: the beautiful boat.
speaker_heading: GUY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold up. What are you doing?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Taking out your boat.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: That’s not my boat. THAT’S my boat.

dialog: guys look pissed.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: INT. BOAT - MOMENTS LATER
text: On the dance floor, Kayla tries to keep up with Sam, who
text: thrust her pelvis at Chad. Kayla slithers seductively down
text: Dex’'s body and bobs her head, simulating blowing him, then
text: slides up and bites his lip.
speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: You know, Austin got a hotel room
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: Def. We’ll get one, too. Don’t
dialog: worry about the money... we can
dialog: split it.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I've gotta be home tonight.
speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: So does Julie, so they’re getting a
text: hotel close to home.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Oh. Well, I don’t know if-
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fuckin’ A right, we’re all gonna

speaker_heading: DEX

speaker_heading: CHAD

dialog: Def.
speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: That's what the fuck I’m talking

dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: A non-smoking room, please.
speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: I’m not sure about you, bro.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Woococ00000000000! ! ! 1!

text: She sees Julie looking over and smiles, then dances again.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR - NIGHT
text: The guys are crammed on the skiff as it slowly chugs out into

speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Can this thing go any faster,

speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Oh, yeah. Way faster, but I thought

speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Good one.

speaker_heading: MITCHELL

dialog: That one!
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Yes!

dialog: 78.
text: The guys approach the party boat. There is no one on the

scene_heading: INT. PARTY BOAT —- MOMENTS LATER
text: The first TUXEDOED GUY they encounter is in his 30s and

speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)

speaker_heading: GROOM

speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Sorry, wrong boat!
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (to Pete re: Mitchell)
dialog: Why do we keep listening to him?!
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Let’s haul ass!
text: The guys take off! They run out on the deck. Hunter turns to
text: climb down the ladder, but there’s no time.
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go!
text: Pete shoves Hunter, who flies off the deck and hits the water
text: next to the boat! Pete and Eli jump into the water. An
text: ELDERLY WOMAN grabs Mitchell, who shoves her, then jumps,
dialog: landing HARD in the boat!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
speaker_heading: AHHHH!
text: The guys scramble into the boat and Hunter cranks the tiny
dialog: engine!
text: ON THE PARTY BOAT
text: The Bride looks at the Groom.
speaker_heading: BRIDE
dialog: Are you sure this was not your
dialog: mother?
speaker_heading: GROOM
dialog: Pretty sure!
text: Both look at the GROOM’S MOTHER, suspiciously, as she does
dialog: the chicken dance.
text: GUESTS throw things at the boat: shoes, the wedding cake and
text: an ice sculpture, which puts a split in the floor of the
dialog: skiff!
speaker_heading: ON THE SKIFF
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Gun it!!!
text: They move away from the party boat as the skiff takes on
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I think we're safe.
text: The guys look momentarily relieved. Suddenly, Pete and
text: Mitchell in the front of the boat are moving away from Eli
text: and Hunter in the back of the boat. The boat has split in
dialog: half.
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR - LATER
text: The four guys hold onto a chunk of the boat and kick their
text: way back toward the pier as the girls’ PARTY BOAT cruises by
text: in the distance.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I bet that's the girls’ boat.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (no shit)
dialog: Thanks, Mitchell.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: This sucks. The rumors I’ve heard
dialog: about the motion of the ocean and
dialog: all that, any truth to that?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: I'm afraid so. When I had my boat,
dialog: I did more offshore drilling than
dialog: BP.
text: LATER...
text: The PARTY BOAT docks and the guys see the girls and their
text: dates step onto the pier.
text: ON THE GUYS...
dialog: «+. Still kicking.
speaker_heading: PETE/ELI
text: JUUUUULIEEEEEEE! !!!!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
scene_heading: KAAAAAAAYLAAAAAI! 111
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: They can’t hear you, guys. Forget
dialog: it. It’s over...
text: They watch, helplessly, as the kids get into the limo and
dialog: drive away.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (getting upset)
dialog: I’m sorry I found the pact, guys. I
dialog: shouldn't have been snooping in
text: Julie’s room in the first place.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: None of this is your fault, Eli.
dialog: This is on us. Tonight is about our
dialog: failings as fathers.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Yeah, Kayla’s acting out because
dialog: she’s embarrassed of me. She
dialog: probably did instigate this whole
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, Mitchell. I’m sorry about
dialog: saying that.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: No, it’s probably true. I want my
dialog: kids to respect me, but I can’t
dialog: even find a job. I’m not worthy of
dialog: their respect.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Well, I didn’t even know Sam was
dialog: being excluded. I’m so wrapped up
dialog: in my own shit that I had no idea
text: about the pain she must be feeling.
dialog: I don’t know anything about her.
text: Hunter is choked up. The guys look at him - they’ve never
dialog: seen him like this.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: The truth is, I’m terrified of her.
dialog: I expected to have a boy. What do I
dialog: have in common with a 15 year old
dialog: girl? So I just... I don’t even
dialog: try. I’m a terrible father.
text: Pete puts his arm on Hunter’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: There’s plenty of blame to go
dialog: around. When I lost Jessica, I
dialog: tried so hard to be Julie’s friend
dialog: that I smothered her. She was
dialog: desperate to prove her
dialog: independence. I drove her to this.
text: Beat. Eli realizes he’s the only one kicking.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Are you guys counting on the tide
dialog: here or what?
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: INT. PETE’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Back on Long Island, Pete exits the highway. The guys sit
text: silently, soaking wet and feeling horrible about themselves.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: You guys shouldn’t be so hard on
dialog: yourselves. At least you’re around.
dialog: My dad left when I was six.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: His loss, Eli.
text: Eli nods a “thank you.” He starts to sob. Hunter puts his arm
dialog: around Eli.
speaker_heading: HUNTER (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s gonna be okay.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Yeah, it’s just that all my hopes
dialog: and dreams are dead... And my pain
dialog: is just beginning. I bet Julie and
dialog: Austin will be doing it all the
dialog: time now. Once you pop, you can’t
dialog: stop.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Julie is a terrific kid. But you’ll
text: meet someone else.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I don’t think so...
text: They drive past a 7-11 and Pete spots something.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Holy shit!
text: Pete whips the minivan into a U-turn and screeches to a stop
text: in the 7-11 parking lot.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What are you doing, Pete!?
text: Pete points at Seth, the limo driver, walking into the 7-11.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D (CONT'D)
dialog: I told you there was a six in the

dialog: 83.
scene_heading: INT. 7-11 - NIGHT
text: The guys rush over to Seth, who leans against a Slurpee
text: machine, enjoying a cold one.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What can I do for you fellas?
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: You know what we want.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Coupla’ eight balls?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Our daughters. They were in your
dialog: limo tonight.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Oh right. I’d love to help you out,
dialog: but I’m not at liberty to say where
dialog: they went. Because of limo
dialog: driver/passenger privilege.
dialog: Confidentiality and all that.
dialog: (rubbing fingers together,
dialog: looking for a bribe)
dialog: You understand.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: I gave you fifty bucks earlier
dialog: tonight!
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I’m back to funerals until next
dialog: summer, man. Do you have any idea
dialog: how poorly grieving people take
dialog: hints?
text: Out of cash, the guys look defeated. Suddenly, a fist
text: connects with Seth’s jaw, knocking him down. The guys look
text: over at Eli, who rubs his hand.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I knew none of you would hit him.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (to Seth)
dialog: Where are they?
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (struggles to get it out)
dialog: I just dropped them off at the
text: Courtyard by Marriott.
text: As the guys look on, Eli turns on the Slurpie machine which
text: pours a steady stream of blue Slurpie onto Seth, who remains
text: on the floor. Eli exits the 7-11 as a man.
speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: (re: Eli)
dialog: The kid’s balls dropped tonight.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Can’t wait.
text: Kayla nods.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It’s not too late to back out of

dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why would I do that? I’m all about
dialog: the cock.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: I’m also pretty much all about the
dialog: cock as well, so...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: This conversation is foul.
text: The boys walk out of the lobby and the three couples split up
text: and head to their rooms.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Okay, well... we’re going to our
dialog: room now.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: We're going to ours, too.

speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: The fuck are we waiting for?

text: blasting on Pete’s car.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Oh crap!
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Eye in the sky!
text: Pete whips the car down an alley and they emerge in a

speaker_heading: HUNTER
dialog: We can’t shake it!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: This is a dead end!
speaker_heading: HELICOPTER COP (0.S.)
dialog: He’s got nowhere to go.
speaker_heading: PETE

text: Pete points to a parking garage.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: That’s crazy. We’ll be trapped!

text: IN THE CRUISER...
text: Hernandez is on the radio.
speaker_heading: HERNANDEZ
text: Suspects have driven into a parking

speaker_heading: DONOHUE
dialog: What the fuck are these guys up to?
text: Donohue stops the cruiser and the two cops hop out, guns

speaker_heading: DONOHUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop the vehicle and get out with
dialog: your hands up!

dialog: and the two OPEN FIRE!!
text: Glass explodes! The car continues toward them and the two

dialog: car hits the wall!

speaker_heading: MITCHELL

speaker_heading: KAYLA

speaker_heading: CHAD (CONT'D)
dialog: No, not the pinky toe!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fuck yes, the pinky toe! He’s my

speaker_heading: HOTEL CLERK

speaker_heading: HOTEL CLERK

speaker_heading: MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're going to give us that

speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)

dialog: 94.
text: The PHONE rings and the Hotel Clerk answers.
speaker_heading: HOTEL CLERK
dialog: Hello?.. A bomb, huh? Yeah, I

speaker_heading: HOTEL CLERK (CONT’D)
