scene_heading: POV - ONE LIGHT INFUSED ELECTRON

text: HERE COMES THE IMPACT POINT... but SCREEEEECH!

text: It's Pentcho himself, on the airplane, listening to Mozart. In the

scene_heading: 14 INT/EXT. THE BEETLE (PENTCHO) - DAY 14

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What the hell were you thinking? What? I
dialog: want to know! WHAT?!!
text: This is WILL (30's), a scratch over one eye, peering in at Pentcho,

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'll be there, Trent. Yes. 20 minutes --
text: Click. Will reddens, sees the sunglassed face of the woman, looking

speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Son-of-a-bitch. As if it was my fault I got

scene_heading: 23a EXT/INT. XANADU - NIGHT 23a
text: A massive wooden door. Mia holds a flashlight, slips an oversized

text: They enter like thieves.
scene_heading: 23b INT. XANADU - A SHORT TIME LATER 23b

speaker_heading: PENTCHO
text: At the sub-atomic level, particles obey

speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: And you think this is relevant to our

text: Pentcho starts his own climb up the scaffolding. Reaches the first

speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: Could be.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: (wryly)
dialog: What universe are you in, Paul?
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: A quantum one.
scene_heading: 23c INT. A HIGHER SCAFFOLDING - A SHORT TIME LATER 23c
text: Pentcho clips a safety line to his belt. The two of them wear

text: over fist, they start to ascend, hoisting themselves up the tug
dialog: ropes.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: The shorthand is, when you send electrons
dialog: through space, it's impossible to say
dialog: precisely what they are: particles or waves.
text: They spin around slowly like tops as they hoist themselves up.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO (CONT'D)
text: They come into being as one or the other at

speaker_heading: PENTCHO (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: How?
text: Mia reaches an electric box, hanging a yard below the ceiling.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Baby, reality is what you choose to make it.

speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: God.
scene_heading: WE SEE WHAT HE SEES:
scene_heading: A GIANT RENAISSANCE-STYLE FRESCO COVERS THE ENTIRE CEILING.
text: Flocks of ANGELS fly above a GODDESS. Cherubs. Heralds.
text: Pentcho's face flushes. He's exhilarated. She takes note:
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: But only if you live your life that way. If
dialog: you experience every moment as discovery.
text: Pentcho's already there. He kicks his legs out. Joyrides on the tug

speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: Mia! You're restoring heaven with dabs of
dialog: paint. You're bringing new order to the

speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: I always said we were in the same

text: The ropes shudder.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: If you're right, we have a chance. (beat) To
dialog: be together.
text: Pentcho reaches out to kiss her. Doesn't see that their collision
text: has jogged the clutch on his harness rope. Now it opens all the way.
speaker_heading: WHOOSH!
text: In an instant, he's gripping air, FALLING at the speed of Newton's
dialog: discovery.
text: He hurtles downward in slow motion. There's a SOUND rushing in
text: behind him, the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE.
text: Pentcho catches a glimpse up over his shoulder: the angels, the
dialog: goddess, Mia, all of it has been
text: SUCKED OUT OF EXISTENCE...
text: as Pentcho's eyes stare for a millisecond at
scene_heading: THE VOID. NOTHINGNESS. NADA.
text: And then he's FALLING again, accelerating toward his own last

speaker_heading: VOICE (OC)
dialog: I'm not done.
text: THWACK! The safety line holds, dangling Pentcho a meter above the

scene_heading: 23d INT. XANADU - SOME TIME LATER 23d

speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Of what?
text: ON THE FRESCO: A CHORUS OF ANGELS
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: God. I dunno. The eternal nothingness.
dialog: Mia.
text: It's a plea. She turns, stares directly into his eyes.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO (CONT'D)
text: The universe is snapping my head back. I'm
dialog: losing my focus.
text: Mia's face fills with light. Her best smile.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Welcome, Paul. Welcome.
text: She traces a line from his forehead to the bridge of his nose,

speaker_heading: MIA (CONT'D)
dialog: "Things fall apart; the center will not

speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: An electron spoke to me yesterday. (beat) I
dialog: swear.
text: Mia tries to suppress a giggle. Can't.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: What did it want?
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: That's what it asked me. "What do you

text: middle of an experiment.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: Like now?
text: He hesitates, then surrenders to the fact.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: Yes.
text: The firefly dances above them. Pentcho sits up (and away from her).
dialog: Mock serious:
speaker_heading: PENTCHO (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you know electrons have lovers?
text: Mia notes his distance. Faces him, cross-legged.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: No. I didn't. (dryly) I'm listening.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: Inside every semi-conductor... you have two

speaker_heading: PENTCHO (CONT'D)
dialog: A strip of silicon, which for you and me

speaker_heading: MIA

text: ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN
text: E-mail. Lots of it. Hundreds and hundreds of messages scrolling by

scene_heading: 41 INT. THE BRAIN FIELD - POPPING OPEN ON 41
speaker_heading: THE EINSTEIN MAN
text: Crumpled on the floor, hands still clutching his chest. The screen
text: COLLAPSES at the sound of
scene_heading: 42 EXT. HOUSE (VOICES SHOUTING FROM THE CORNER) - NIGHT 42
text: Foreign voices, jabbering at high speed. Policemen BARK BACK on
text: loudspeakers. Walkie-talkies.
text: Pentcho RAPS ON THE GLASS. He's frantic. Harder now. A THUNK
text: sounds from inside. Or was it? He picks one last key out in the
text: glare of the blue lights. Jams it in the lock. Twists and
scene_heading: 43 INT. THE HOUSE - PENTCHO 43
text: bursts into the darkened foyer. His foot catches on a thick doormat.
text: He SPRAWLS forward as
text: A GUNSHOT ERUPTS ABOVE HIS HEAD
text: He drops, convulsed with fear. Snaps his head back to see:
speaker_heading: THE EINSTEIN MAN (ALEXANDER)
text: in bathrobe and slippers, hands shaking around a shotgun.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: Paul... Pauly...
text: Pentcho struggles to breathe. Staccato:
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: I... I thought you were dead.
text: Alexander drops the gun. In shock, a whisper:
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: I must be.
scene_heading: 44 INT. BAR AREA (A TEA KETTLE WHISTLES) - NIGHT 44
text: Alexander, recomposed, marches to the burners. There's anger in his
text: every movement. Restlessness. This is no feeble old man. He pours
text: tea like he was filling shot glasses. Doubles.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: Look at me.
text: Pentcho stirs in a lump of sugar first. Raises his eyes.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER (CONT'D)
dialog: (contemptuous)
dialog: "Alexander the Great."
text: He lifts a kitchen chair, spins it around, straddles the back.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER (CONT'D)
dialog: 22 I built the first machine to transfer
dialog: digital bits over a land line. I wrote the
dialog: TCP/IP protocol before thirty. This mind
dialog: (tapping his temples), the one and only, was
text: OBGYN at the birth of the Internet. And
dialog: where has it taken me?
text: He shoots upright. Peers out the row of double sash windows, covered
text: by impenetrable iron grates.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER (CONT'D)
dialog: To isolation. To an armed camp. To a
text: biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a
text: gun at his only son.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: You taking any medication?
text: Alexander's eyes FLARE in anger.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: Don't waste it Pauly. This is not an
dialog: everyday talk. Just input the information
dialog: and ask relevant questions. One: how did a
dialog: celebrated life of the mind bring me
dialog: (pulling the gun out) to this particular
dialog: switching station?
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: Dad...
text: He shoves the shotgun into an open trash can.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: Two: what if I didn't miss?
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: You did.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: Spare me your classical answer.
dialog: Measurements in. Results taken. What if I
dialog: didn't miss?
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: You did miss --
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: -- What if your seven and a half precious
text: liters were downloading over the parquet
dialog: floor? What then? (softer) What did your
dialog: life mean? (beat) Who did you nurture,
dialog: Pauly? Who did you love?
text: Pentcho shifts, uncomfortably, in his seat. Ditto Alexander's mood.
text: He does a startling one-eighty into nonchalance.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER (CONT'D)
dialog: What was her name?
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: Excuse me???
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: What was her name? The one I met.
text: Alexander reaches out a finger, touches the dab of paint on Pentcho's
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: Mia...?
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: Yes....
text: He rubs the paint between his fingers.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER (CONT'D)
dialog: The restorer...
text: Now he wanders off, disappears into the dark.
text: ON PENTCHO: wired, incredulous, heart thump thump thumping.
text: He calls out after his father.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: I need some air. (beat) Don't shoot me.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER'S VOICE (OC)
dialog: Good night.
scene_heading: INT. ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: Pentcho paces in front of the open window, stops. He turns to walk
text: out, is surprised by
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
text: Standing in the dark.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: We've been kidding ourselves, Pauly. Until
dialog: you look for it, it doesn't even exist.
scene_heading: 45 EXT. SAN PEDRO WHARF - NIGHT 45
text: Pentcho slogs down the wharf. Running from it. Looking for it.
text: Past homeless people slipping in and out of the shadows. He snaps
text: his head back over his shoulder, sees an OLD WOMAN playing the
text: accordian. She stops. Her eyes bore in on his own.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: You would have a son with me...
text: Pentcho blinks. The woman is suddenly FIFTY YEARS YOUNGER:
speaker_heading: YOUNG OLD WOMAN
dialog: ...and his name would be Hope.
scene_heading: 46 INT. PENTCHO'S BRAIN - (A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA) 46
text: Numbers fly up on the field, are inscribed, erased, considered and
text: measured. Pentcho's own VOICE is heard on overlap:
speaker_heading: PENTCHO'S VOICE
dialog: "If you could look back fast enough, at near
dialog: to the speed of light, then there would be
dialog: no reality behind you, because it hadn't yet
dialog: been created --
scene_heading: 47 EXT. THE WHARF - (A FOGHORN) NIGHT 47
text: BELLOWS in the dark. Pentcho twists his head forward, spots:
scene_heading: A PINK NEON HEART
text: blinking above a tatto parlor. His eyes lock on, see the heart
scene_heading: GLOWING BIGGER AND BIGGER,
text: its electric pulse mimicing the beating of a real organ.
scene_heading: CLOSER STILL - ON PENTCHO
text: Running from it. Looking for it. He stops dead in his tracks, tries
dialog: one last time to play gunfighter with the quantum reality:
text: HE SNAPS HIS HEAD BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER
text: and we see him, making the same move, from four different camera
text: angles: from his LEFT, his RIGHT, from the TOP OF HIS HEAD, and
text: looking up FROM GROUND ZERO as
text: HE FINALLY WINS THE DRAW.
text: The RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE is unleashed. Here it comes,
text: rolling in with a giant WHOOSHING SOUND...
scene_heading: POV PENTCHO: WATCHING REALITY SUCKED OUT OF EXISTENCE
text: The ships, the dock, the harbor OBLITERATED by an onrushing,
text: transparent cloud of NOTHINGNESS, EMPTINESS, a tabula rasa
text: superimposed upon the disappeared wharf.
text: ON PENTCHO, FALLING TO HIS KNEES
text: hammered by his own victory, numb from shock and ecstasy, staring
text: into the void as we surge forward
scene_heading: 48 INT. THE BRAIN FIELD 48
text: It's completely blank, just like the void. The VITALS are flatlined.
text: A single piece of thought text floats across the emptiness, almost
text: like a screen saver:
dialog: Say Uncle.... Say Uncle...
scene_heading: 49 EXT. THE WHARF - (A VOICE) - NIGHT 49
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Uncle, hey...
text: A face, peering down at Pentcho. The face belongs to the MAGIC MAN,
text: in a mad hatter hat, and a potpourri of found item clothing. Like a
text: Baptist preacher on his sidewalk pulpit:
speaker_heading: MAGIC MAN
dialog: Can you feel it, uncle? Can you feel it
dialog: right down to your bones?!
scene_heading: ON PENTCHO: EXTREME CLOSE UP
text: Inside each pupil is the reflection of the NEON HEART. We pull back
text: on Pentcho's face. Calm. Serene.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: Yes. (beat) Yes I can.
scene_heading: 50 EXT. ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 50
text: Pentcho turns the key, effortlessly opens the front door.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HOUSE - AN ORNATE TILE SHOWER - NIGHT
text: He stands beneath the stream of hot water, cleansing himself of a day
dialog: that began a very long time ago.
scene_heading: INT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Pentcho dresses, taking in the smell and texture of fresh clothes
text: against his body. He sits down on the bed. Sees a clock. 5:00 a.m.
text: TUGS UP one of the double sash windows that faces the 7-Eleven.
text: VOICES rise from the parking lot.
text: Pentcho stretches out on the musty bedspread, eyes on the carved
text: plaster ceiling. Suddenly, floating up through the open window:
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: What do you want?!
text: Pentcho cranes his head.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me! Now! Now!
text: The old sash falls shut. BOOM. It's like a dam bursting inside him,
text: only the flood is LAUGHTER that starts deep in his belly, as a
text: giggle, then a chuckle that cascades upward and out into enormous
text: GUFFAWS. The sound rocks the house. Pentcho's smile is a mile wide.
text: His eyes sparkle, then tear up as the
scene_heading: FRONT DOORBELL RINGS
text: He jumps off the bed, and bounds down the stairs.
scene_heading: 53 INT. THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT 53
text: Alexander's already there, ushering MIA inside to:
scene_heading: 54 INT. THE LIVING ROOM - AT THE MOMENT THAT 54
text: Pentcho arrives. He stops, incredulous, at the sight of her.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: Guess who's coming to dinner.
text: Mia jumps right in. To Pentcho:
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: I didn't want to leave things the way we
dialog: did. Not this time.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: Wait. I want to tell you something.
text: He takes her arm, steering her away from Alexander, into the living
text: room. She stops cold at the sight of the MURAL.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: I've been dreaming about this.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Then you get it. You'll understand.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: What?
text: His face has the look of the little boy who has just stumbled upon
text: the pirate's treasure.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: I know what I want. I let go, and a second
dialog: later you materialized at the door. You
dialog: see?
scene_heading: CLOSE ON PENTCHO
dialog: feeling the feelings.
speaker_heading: PENTCHO (CONT'D)
dialog: Mia. I can create reality. (beat) I can
dialog: choose to love you with all my heart.
text: Tears pool along the rims of her eyes. She stares straight at him,
dialog: hiding nothing.
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: You know those people who won't be
dialog: photographed because they're afraid you're
dialog: stealing their souls...?
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: I came to take back my picture. The one I
dialog: keep leaving with you.
text: His heart deflates. His voice follows. Barely audible:
speaker_heading: PENTCHO
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MIA
dialog: So I can move on. You too.
text: A horn blares from outside.
speaker_heading: MIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Be who you are, Paul. I love who you are.
dialog: I do.
text: She turns and runs out the front door.
scene_heading: 55 EXT. ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT 55
text: Mia runs down to the curb where where boyfriend WILL holds open the
text: passenger door of the red Durango.
speaker_heading: MIA'S VOICE
dialog: I'll drive.
text: She circles the car, disappears behind the wheel. Will gets in his
dialog: side.
text: ON THE FRONT PORCH
text: Pentcho, agitated, pushes open the door. Alexander's already
text: outside, watching Mia motor off. He turns, stares at his son.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER
dialog: Do you want to think about it some more?
text: PENTCHO SPRINTS DOWN TO THE CURB. Jumps into the Beetle. The
text: headlights FLASH ON in the pre-dawn night.
scene_heading: 56 INT. THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT 56
text: Mia grips the wheel with two hands. Will feigns nonchalance.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You okay?
text: She nods. Barely. They merge onto the highway.
scene_heading: 57 INT. THE BEETLE (DRIVING) - NIGHT 57
text: Pentcho grips the wheel. Eyes focused. We surge into
scene_heading: 58 INT. PENTCHO'S BRAIN FIELD - OPENING ON 58
text: PEARLS, PLAYING OUT, LOOPING INTO A STRING
text: whose shape recalls the original brain field. Thought text scrolls
text: below, accompanied now by Pentcho's own inner voice.
speaker_heading: VOICE AND TEXT
dialog: Each part of physical reality is constructed
dialog: of all the other parts...
scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSE-UP, ON A SINGLE PEARL
text: inside of which, the entire strand is reflected.
speaker_heading: VOICE AND TEXT (CONT'D)
dialog: A web of connections created by the
dialog: interdependence of all things...
text: The field collapses back into:
scene_heading: 59 INT. MIA IN THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT 59
text: eyes on the rear view mirror, as a horn BLARES from the entrance to
dialog: the Long Beach bridge.
text: She re-checks the mirror, filled with bobbing headlight beams. One
text: beam LOCKS ON, straight into the center of the glass, blinding her
text: for a split second. She blinks. Gasps to herself as the beam seems
dialog: to
text: LIFT OUT OF HER MIRROR
text: and train its phosphorescent glow on:
scene_heading: MIA - EXTREME CLOSE UP
text: the point of light reflecting out of her pupils. PENTCHO'S VOICE
text: speaks from nowhere, sonorous and packed with reverb:
speaker_heading: PENTCHO'S VOICE
dialog: What do you want?
text: Mia blinks again. The beam is gone. She looks over at WILL,
text: oblivious, checking his watch.
speaker_heading: BACK ON MIA
text: the understanding flooding her eyes as
text: SHE SNAPS HER HEAD BACK (JUST LIKE PENTCHO THE GUNFIGHTER)
text: And we see her making her move from FOUR DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLES,
text: from her left, right, up above, and from the back seat of the car as
text: the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE WHOOSHES BY...
scene_heading: POV MIA: THE BRIDGE, THE CARS, THE BAY
text: all sucked out of existence until nothing remains but
scene_heading: THE VOID. NOTHINGNESS. NADA. CRASH!
scene_heading: 60 INT. THE DURANGO (SLAMMING INTO THE CAR AHEAD) - NIGHT 60
text: triggering a chain reaction of vehicles fish-tailing across the
text: bridge. In quick succession come a STREAM OF IMAGES:
text: The pearls colliding...
text: Mia and Will exchanging a LOOK...
text: Traffic HALTING on the bridge...
text: Will getting SCORCHED by the MAN they plowed into...
text: Mia, exiting her side, looking BACK BEHIND HER...
text: PENTCHO, ditching his Beetle, ten car lengths south...
text: HE RUNS FORWARD, straight down the path of a tunnel-like headlight
dialog: beam.
text: MIA PICKS UP SPEED, churning from the other direction.
scene_heading: PULL BACK: FROM THE BRIDGE
text: as the two of them move toward the same point. Suddenly, tiny sparks
text: of light GLOW and JUMP from portions of the bridge cable.
scene_heading: SLOW MOTION: PENTCHO AND MIA
text: gliding still closer. A VOICE sounds:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Impact!
text: Their bodies CONNECT, arms intertwine, lips touch lips...
scene_heading: PULL BACK - HIGHER
text: It's like a plug in the socket of the physical landscape
scene_heading: LIGHTING THE ENTIRE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM
dialog: Every cell line, radio wave, satellite feed, fiber-optic cable, all
dialog: stretching in every possible direction
text: FROM BRIDGE TO SEA TO SKY
text: pulsing outward into a spidery network of
text: GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS.
speaker_heading: THE END
