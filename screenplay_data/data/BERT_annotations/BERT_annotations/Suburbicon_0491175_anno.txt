dialog: Original Screenplay by
dialog: Joel Coen and Ethan Coen
dialog: This draft: March 27, 2007
dialog: Black.
text: In black we hear a light, irregular tapping, thin and sharp, as of something tapping against
dialog: glass.
text: A slow fade-up defines crossing slats of wood—a window frame. The panes themselves
dialog: remain black: it is night.
text: A delayed fade-up now defines a branch, leafless and twisted, tapping against a pane.
text: We are looking out a second-story window.
text: Now fading up is the rest of the tree, a tangle of bare branches, swaying.
text: And finally the streetlit mansard and eaves of a house across the street, solid, suburban.
text: We start to pull back. A junior-scale baseball bat leans against the wall by the window.
text: The continuing pullback shows a mitt and ball on a bookshelf nearby and other marks of
text: a young boy’s bedroom.
text: Under the tapping of the limb, the approaching murmur of male voices. We hear
text: footsteps on a staircase as the two voices assume distinct characters—one placating, one
text: gruff.
text: The murmuring ends as we hear a door opening. A shaft of light cuts across the room.
text: Only one pair of footsteps enters.
text: Our track back finds and settles on an eight-year-old boy asleep in bed. A hand enters to
text: shake him awake.
dialog: Voice
dialog: Nicky. Wake up.
text: The boy’s eyes open.
text: Gardner, his father, stands over him in a bathrobe.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Nicky. ..
text: Silhouetted in the doorway beyond him is a man in an overcoat.
dialog: ... You have to get up, son. There are men in the house.
text: The boy climbs out of bed and takes his father’s hand.
scene_heading: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
text: Nicky holds his father’s hand as they go to the stairs. Following behind is the overcoated
text: man, about thirty-five years old, Hispanic, heavy-set. His mustacheless beard and
text: receding hairline accentuate the roundness of his face.
text: We hear a stop-and-start electronic whir from downstairs.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: We'll just do what they tell us and they’!l leave soon.
dialog: Everything will be all right.
text: Nicky looks back over his shoulder at the man following behind.
text: The man stares at Nicky as he walks. No expression.
text: The three begin to descend the stairs. Opposite the bannister two rails are sunk into the
text: staircase wall. The whirring noise grows louder.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: These men are just going to look around a little and then
dialog: they’ll leave.
text: Nicky looks through the bannister, descending.
text: The living room below comes into view, foreground strobed by balusters. Two women in
text: bathrobes are seated on a flower-print couch. The first is a handsome woman in her early
text: forties—the boy’s mother, Rose. The second is a few years younger but is heavier and
text: less attractive—the boy’s aunt, Margaret. Both look apprehensively at:
text: A second overcoated man, riding a motorized wheelchair around the living room,
text: stopping here and there to poke through drawers and shelves.
text: Gardner twitches with anger.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Get the hell out of there.
text: He lets go of Nicky’s hand and hurries down the stairs.
text: The man in the wheelchair makes it pivot to face the stairs. He is in his forties, like the
text: other man heavy-set and roundfaced, but Anglo, crew-cut, face shadowed by beard-
text: stubbled and punctuated with spikes of white nostril- and ear-hair. He is Ira Sloan.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Shaddup.
text: The father stops in the middle of the living room.
dialog: ... Get mea drink.
text: They stare at each other. Finally the father turns towards the bar at the back end of the
text: living room. He pours some bourbon into a glass and starts toward the man in the wheel-
dialog: chair.
dialog: ... Ona tray.
text: Another exchange of hard looks. The father turns back to the bar for a small metal tray,
text: places the drink on it, brings it to Ira Sloan. Ira Sloan reaches for it.
text: Nicky is halted at the foot of the stairs. He watches Ira Sloan.
text: Leering at the boy’s father from the wheelchair, Ira Sloan takes the drink from the tray.
text: His hand is gloved—a leather driving glove with perforations for breathing and vents at
dialog: the knuckles.
text: The Hispanic man, Luis Colina, pushes Nicky forward into the living room. Luis Colina
text: is wearing the same driving gloves.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Gimme a drink on a tray too.
text: Ira Sloan steps up out of the wheelchair. He pushes the wheelchair toward the couch.
text: At the bar Gardner finishes pouring the second drink and turns.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Don’t give that to him. Gets mean when he’s drunk.
text: Gardner looks back and forth between the two men.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Give it here.
text: Gardner looks at Ira Sloan, who shrugs.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: All right. Your fucking responsibility.
text: Gardner crosses the living room to hand over the drink.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: What do you want to do? Let’s get this over with.
text: Luis Colina is taking a sip from his drink.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: What’s the hurry, got an appointment?
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: He’s got an appointment. He’s got a social appointment.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Where’s the toilet?
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Forget that. Let’s quit fucking around and go.
text: Nick looks at Ira Sloan striding toward his mother. Beneath his overcoat are what seems
text: like uniform pants, blue with a darker blue satin stripe running down the seam to a pair of
text: shiny black lace-up boots.
text: At the couch now, Ira Sloan bends down towards the older woman, his head close to hers,
text: almost as if to kiss her.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Just put your arms around my neck.
text: She does.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: T’ll do that.
text: Ira Sloan scoops her off the couch.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Why don’t you just shut up. She don’t mind.
text: As he carries her over to the wheelchair:
dialog: ... You don’t mind, do ya ma’am?
dialog: Rose
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: She don’t mind.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Tell me where the toilet is. I gotta pee like there’s no
text: tamarra.
dialog: Margaret
text: Through the hall on the left.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Thank you ma’am.
text: Nicky walks over to his mother and watches Luis Colina leave. He is also wearing the
text: blue dress pants and black lace-up boots. Nick puts a hand on his mother’s arm.
text: Luis Colina’s exit has left a lull in the talk. Finally:
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: If I were you I’d keep an eye on that guy. He’s, uh,
dialog: whadda they say, he’s loco, ya know, he’s outta his fucking
dialog: mind. And he’s got a weight problem.
text: He leans in confidentially to Gardner:
dialog: ... You don’t think that was his first drink, do ya?
dialog: Rose
dialog: How can we keep him away from Nicky?
text: Ira Sloan shrugs indifference:
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Beats me.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: We have an understanding, correct—
dialog: Luis Colina
text: (laughing as he reenters)
dialog: An understanding, yeah.
text: He is carrying a blue bath mat and a matching blue toilet seat cover in one hand. A dark
text: metal box is tucked under his other arm. He waves the toilet seat cover.
dialog: ... This one-size-fits-all?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Yes, it’s, uh... standard. Standard size.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: It better be. How’s this thing work?
text: He holds up a TiVo box, its cords dangling.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: You. . . It records your television programs to a hard drive
dialog: but—
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Off the cable?
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Yes but you have to up-res to high def—You have to—
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Ah fuck it.
text: He drops the box clattering to the floor.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Let’s quit fucking around.
scene_heading: BASEMENT STAIRCASE
text: As its light is switched on. Two rails, like those on the upper staircase, run the length of
text: the stairs. At the head of the stairs Gardner wheels Rose onto the platform that travels on
text: the piping.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: We have an agreement, don’t we, that if we Clarkate no
dialog: harm will come to us.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Yeah we got an agreement but I ain’t God, you know what
dialog: I mean?
dialog: Gardner
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: No, I’m not sure I do.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Well, that makes two of us.
speaker_heading: MINUTES LATER
text: Nicky and the rest of the family are in the home’s finished basement, a rec room with a
text: pool table, old television set, etc.
text: All four are seated. Gardner and Margaret are already bound hand and foot. Ira Sloan is
text: now working on Rose as Nicky looks on, seated next to her. As Ira Sloan finishes a knot:
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: That more comfortable for ya, ma’am?
dialog: Rose
dialog: I’m fine. Just... please, don’t hurt us. You promised you
dialog: wouldn’t hurt us.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Would we bother to tie you up if we were gonna hurt ya?
text: It’s a question that answers itself.
text: He looks at her for a moment.
dialog: ... You must think we’re pretty sick. A couple a animals.
dialog: Is that what you think?
text: She doesn’t answer. Ira Sloan’s tone sharpens:
dialog: ...Lasked you a question. Smart guy.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: No no, she doesn’t think that.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Shaddup. I’ve had enough from you. Don’t tell her what
dialog: she thinks.
dialog: Rose
dialog: No, I don’t think that.
text: Ira Sloan has finished on Rose. He straightens up, glances over at Margaret.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: You’re pretty quiet over there.
text: She doesn’t say anything.
dialog: ... What do you think about all this?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: I... I’m sure you won’t hurt us.
text: Ira Sloan smiles, stoops down to start tying up Nicky.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Lady, you ain’t in a position to be sure about anything.
text: He is thinking out loud.
dialog: ... Anyway, you make me sick.
dialog: Rose
dialog: Do you have to tie him up?
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Jesus Christ, think about it for a minute. It’s a question that
text: answers itself.
text: A cel phone rings.
text: Ira Sloan and Luis Colina look at each other, uncertain. A beat.
text: Luis Colina reaches into his pocket and takes out a phone. He squints at its display:
dialog: Gombrich.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Shit. I gotta get this.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: You're shittin’ me.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Nah, it’s all right.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: You gotta be fuckin’—
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Nah, it’s all right. Just keep it down. No one talk.
text: He flips open the phone, his other hand held up toward Ira Sloan for silence.
dialog: Hey man... Not much. . . Just, you know, on the job. .. I
dialog: know. .. Iknow. .. Okay. You too, man. Have a good
dialog: one.
text: He flips the phone shut and looks at Rose.
dialog: ... You got a bathroom down here?
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: What? You gotta pee again? What’re you so fucking
dialog: nervous about?
text: He straightens up from Nicky, a little nervous himself.
dialog: ... Just give me the chloroform.
text: Luis Colina hands him a bottle. Ira Sloan takes out his handkerchief, soaks it, and heads
dialog: for Margaret.
dialog: ... We’ll start with the auntie over here. Shut up her
text: yapping. "Auntie Em, Auntie Em..."
text: He holds the handkerchief over her mouth.
dialog: Just breathe normal.
text: She struggles before passing out.
dialog: ... God, I love that fucking movie.
text: Nicky shrinks back in his chair, watching.
dialog: 10
text: Ira Sloan is moving for the father. As he puts the handkerchief over his mouth, Rose
text: starts to wail.
dialog: Rose
dialog: No. . . please don’t...
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Shutup you. No more talking.
text: As Gardner passes out, he turns and walks towards the mother.
text: As Nicky watches the man approach his mother he starts to struggle violently and cry.
text: He is writhing in his chair as much as the rope will allow.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Do the kid. He’s freaking out.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Fuck you. You do him.
text: A pair of hands comes into frame with a red bandana soaked in chloroform.
text: Nicky struggles, tossing his head, making it impossible for Luis Colina to press the rag
text: over his face.
text: Ira Sloan stands behind his mother with a handkerchief. Her eyes are on him.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Just settle down, kid.
dialog: Rose
dialog: Be gentle with—
text: Ira Sloan is pressing the kerchief over her mouth.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: We’re just gonna send him to Oz...
text: Nicky, still struggling, looks at his mother.
dialog: ... It'll bea riot.
text: Luis Colina gets his hands over Nicky’s mouth. He settles down.
dialog: 11
text: His mother is passed out, her head lolling onto her chest. Ira Sloan re-soaks his
text: handkerchief, grabs her by the hair, pulls her head back and clamps the kerchief over her
text: mouth again.
text: Nicky starts to struggle again, but Luis Colina has his rag firmly over his mouth now.
text: He sees Ira Sloan with his kerchief over his mother’s mouth.
text: His eyes start to droop.
text: He sees his mother’s legs. They are starting to tremble.
text: The picture begins to fade.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Jesus, Jesus...
text: Offscreen, muffled, mixing down:
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: If you’re gonna puke do it in the bathroom. Fucking
dialog: greaseball. ..

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WAITING ROOM
text: A middle-aged black man holds a blood-soaked towel around his arm, waiting for
text: attendance. In the background we can hear the squeak of rubber-soled shoes on linoleum,
text: an echoing PA system occasionally paging a doctor, etc.
text: Nicky, sitting opposite the injured man, is staring at him. He is pale, drawn, exhausted.
text: He looks down the hall.
text: Near the door to the waiting room, his father stands listening to a short Oriental doctor
text: whose words are barely discernible:
dialog: Doctor
text: —she’s on a respirator and we’re profusing her, but,
dialog: frankly, the prognosis is not good. Chloroform’s a
text: progressive depressant. It works on the motors and usually
dialog: just has a temporary narcotic effect, but obviously your
dialog: 12
dialog: wife respired a lot more of the stuff. . .
text: Nicky looks away, the doctor’s voice continuing in the background as a muffled drone.
text: The black man seated across from him looks at him impassively.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
speaker_heading: WAITING ROOM
text: Later. Nicky is waking up as we hear a door open offscreen. He rubs his eyes, looks
text: across the room.
text: The chair where the black man had been sitting is now empty. There are a few drops of
text: blood on the linoleum floor next to the chair.
text: On either side of Nicky, Gardner and Margaret rise from their chairs. Nicky’s eyes
text: follow them as they leave frame. He edges apprehensively forward.
text: His father and aunt are talking to the doctor. His voice is muted, solemn. Margaret starts
text: sobbing. Gardner, nodding meaninglessly, looks at the doctor, looks at Nicky. He starts
text: slowly across the room towards Nicky.
text: Nicky, watching his father approach, sinks back into his chair.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: CEMETERY
text: A sleek wooden coffin is being hydraulically lowered into a grave. As it slips down it
text: reveals the members of the family and other mourners standing on the far lip of the grave.
text: Nick is flanked on one side by Gardner and on the other by a stocky man with a solid
text: gut—Nick’s Uncle Mitch.
text: Nick mutely watches the coffin being lowered as the priest intones a prayer.
text: The hydraulics lowering the coffin make the same sound as the staircase wheelchair. The
text: coffin comes to rest at the bottom of the grave. The priest has finished speaking. A
text: scoopful of dirt hits the top of the coffin.
dialog: 13
text: Gardner hands the scoop to Margaret. She shovels some dirt into the grave, then breaks
text: down. Gardner puts a consoling arm around her and leads her away.
text: Nicky watches them. His father gives Margaret a consoling kiss.
text: Nicky turns back toward the grave.
text: Uncle Mitch scoops some dirt into it, then takes a small flower from his lapel and tosses
text: it down onto the coffin.
speaker_heading: CEMETERY ROAD
text: Nicky, Gardner, Mitch and Margaret are approaching the family limo. The priest is
text: hurrying to meet them.
dialog: Priest
dialog: Please remember, Gardner, if there’s anything you need,
dialog: don’t hesitate to call me. Rose was a very brave woman
dialog: and...
text: Mitch, muttering, draws Nicky away while Gardner and Margaret talk to the priest.
text: Mitch’s accent is Bronx working-class.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: Full a shit. Come on, Nicky, let’s you and me take a little
dialog: walk.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Yes sir.
text: They start walking down the drive.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: These fucking Episcopalian priests. Jesus Christ. They
dialog: don’t give two shits about spiritual guidance and family
dialog: and the concerns of, you know. The bereaved. You know
dialog: what they’re thinkin’ about Nicky?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: No sir.
dialog: Mitch
text: Their next martini.
dialog: 14
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Yes sir.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: That’s what these guys drink. With a fuckin’ gahnish.
dialog: What a suhvice. A goddamn travesty. Your mother was a
dialog: fuckin’ catlick, Nicky—excuse me. I’m upset. We’re all
text: upset.
text: He wipes an eye, shakes his head.
dialog: She was a catlick. Until she was hijacked. My sister was
dialog: hijacked by a goddamn Wasp. You know what a Wasp is?
dialog: Never mind. Just rememba: your mutha was a catlick.
dialog: And that makes you a catlick. Not a goddamn Wasp. Jesus
dialog: Christ. That suhvice. And what was with that seurmon.
dialog: It’s like he didn’t even know huh, that fuckin’ priest. A
dialog: bunch of inane verbiage. He coulda been talkin’ about
dialog: anybody. These people have no soul, no values. Thank
dialog: god they drink or they’d control everything. They got their
dialog: eye on the ball, Nicky. Which is money. People think it’s
dialog: Jews think about money all the time. No. It’s these people.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Yes sir.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: When you’re older you’ ll understand.
text: He looks at Nicky and finally seems to realize he is talking to an eight-year-old. He
text: smiles, reaches out and pinches Nicky’s nose between the middle knuckles of his index
text: and middle fingers.
dialog: . .. Who’s got ya nose, ya fuckin’ kid, ya?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: You do, Uggle Mitch.
text: Mitch releases Nicky’s nose.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: Who loves ya like a son?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: (rubbing the color back into his nose)
dialog: 15
dialog: Daddy does.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: (undaunted)
dialog: Yeah, well, who else?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: You do, Uncle Mitch.
text: Mitch is taking coins out of his pocket and slipping them into various pockets of Nicky’s
dialog: suit.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: Who let’s you keep all the coins that stay in ya pockets?
text: Mitch is scooping Nicky off the ground with one arm around his waist.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: You do, Uncle Mitch.
text: Mitch takes one of Nicky’s ankles in one hand, then the other ankle in the other hand.
text: With the boy now dangling upside down, Mitch starts shaking him vigorously.
text: Apparently it is a ritual of long standing.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: Goddamn, kid, you weigh a fucking ton.
text: Coins are jangling out of Nicky’s pockets and spinning on the asphalt beneath him.
speaker_heading: LIMO INTERIOR
text: Gardner sits with Margaret in the back of their limo, now tooling down the street.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Damn it. Just once I’d like to see your brother show a little
dialog: sense. ..
text: Through the windshield of the limousine we see Mitch, standing in the middle of the
text: road, giving frantic but comically silent bounces to the upside-down Nicky.
dialog: . .. Just once I’d like to see that.
speaker_heading: EXTERIOR LIMO
dialog: 16
text: As it pulls up next to Mitch. The back door opens as Mitch lets the boy back to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Come on, kids.
text: Nicky scrambles into the car but Mitch is on his hands and knees, picking coins off the
text: pavement. His face is flushed from the exertion.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: Hold your hosses, Maggie, I’m paying for the limousine.
speaker_heading: INTERIOR LIMO
text: Nicky is seated between Gardner and Margaret. Mitch faces them, his back to the driver.
text: At the cut we hear only the hum of the engine. The awkward silence inside the car is
text: finally broken by Gardner:
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Nicky, we’ve decided that it would be best if your Auntie
dialog: Margaret stayed with us for awhile. You’d like that,
dialog: wouldn’t you?
text: Nicky doesn’t say anything. He stares out the window at the bleak cemetery slipping by.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: If I didn’t have a business to run, by God I’d stay too.
dialog: Would you like that, son?
text: Nicky looks out the window, silent.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: He’s had a bad shock. He doesn’t want to talk now. I think
dialog: he just needs some time.
text: Mitch takes a small flask of whisky out of his coat pocket, unscrews the cap and takes a
text: long drought. He offers it to Gardner.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: No thanks, Mitch.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: 17
dialog: Do ya good.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: No thanks.
text: Mitch shrugs and takes another swig. He burps, then sighs and looks out the window.
text: He grimaces at a thought. Angrily, to no one:
dialog: Mitch
dialog: What was with that suhvice?
dialog: Silence.
text: Mitch comes to. He looks across the limo at the family.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: I’ll promise you one thing, Gahdnuh. If I ever get my
dialog: hands on the cocksuckas that did that to Rosie, I’m gonna
text: fuckin’ peel ’em back from their assholes. Just right inside
dialog: the fuck out, sittin theh with theh fuckin guts hangin out—
dialog: Margaret
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Mitch.
text: Mitch looks at her, puzzled, then follows her glance to the child.
text: His gaze drifts off again. Again his face clouds.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: . .. What was with that suhvice?
scene_heading: NICKY’S BEDROOM NIGHT
text: We are close on Nicky asleep in bed. The thin, sharp tapping sound. . . the muffled
text: voices of the two killers, echoing, dreamlike. . . footsteps approaching on the staircase,
text: and the sound of his bedroom door opening—
text: Nicky bolts upright in bed, sweating, and the noises abruptly stop.
text: He looks over at the door: not open. Hallway light leaks from underneath.
text: But, from downstairs, a brief exchange of male voices and the sound of a door closing, a
text: heavy door, like the front door of the house. Was it real?
dialog: 18
text: Nicky is breathing hard. Slowly he climbs out of bed and pads across the room to the
text: door, listening.
scene_heading: THE HALLWAY
text: We are on the door to Nicky’s bedroom; it slowly opens and Nick peers cautiously out.
text: The hallway is empty.
text: Nick emerges from the bedroom and heads for the stairway. We hear Gardner’s muffled
text: voice, then silence.
text: Nick starts down the stairs.
text: His point-of-view: bannister rails strobe in the foreground; the foremost part of the living
text: room is coming into view; the backmost part is still hidden in by our high perspective.
text: Nick slowly descends.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: DAD...?
text: His dropping point-of-view shows more of the living room; finally a pair of legs comes
text: into view and then the rest of Gardner, striding into the foremost part of the living room,
text: looking up the stairs. Ice cubes click in the drink he holds.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Nicky. How long have you been there?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: ... Thad a bad dream.
text: Gardner looks off screen.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Maggie?
text: We hear footsteps and Margaret enters frame from the back of the living room, wearing a
text: rumpled bathrobe. She looks up at Nicky.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: What’s the matter, angel?
dialog: 19
dialog: Gardner
dialog: He had a nightmare. Uh... Maggie ll put you to bed.
text: Margaret has already started up the stairs, extending her hand towards Nicky.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Come along, sweetheart. Auntie’! tuck you in.
speaker_heading: THE BEDROOM
text: Nicky scrambles into bed. Margaret starts tucking in the covers.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: There’s nothing to be afraid of any more, Nicky.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: I know.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Did you say your prayers before you went to sleep?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Umm... I forgot.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Well that’s probably why you had nightmares. Shall we
dialog: say one together?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Uh-huh
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Which one do you say?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Our Father who art in heaven. . .
text: Margaret recites with him:
dialog: Nicky and Margaret
dialog: Hallowed be thy name;
dialog: Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
dialog: On earth as it is in heaven.
dialog: Give us this day our daily bread,
dialog: 20
dialog: And forgive us our trespasses
dialog: As we forgive those who trespass against us.
dialog: And lead us not into temptation,
dialog: But deliver us from evil.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Amen.
text: She strokes Nicky’s hair.
dialog: ... You know when you talk to God you talk to your
dialog: mother too, because your mother is with God now.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Yes ma’am.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Your mother is with God, but your daddy and me and
dialog: Uncle Mitch are still with you.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Yes ma’am.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: And we love you.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Okay. ..
text: His eyes are drifting shut.
dialog: ... Aunt Margaret?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Yes, Nicky.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Are you a catlick?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Catholic? Yes.
dialog: 21
dialog: Nicky
dialog: (drowsily)
dialog: Okay. .. Aunt Margaret?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: They were . . .wearing the same pants.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Who, angel?
dialog: Nick
dialog: Those men. .. who came in. . . the house.
text: His eyes flutter open.
text: Margaret is gazing down at him, her mouth slightly open, expressionless.
text: After a beat she smiles, reassuringly. His eyes start to droop again. They slowly close
dialog: and we:
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
scene_heading: BATHROOM MORNING
text: We are close on Gardner. He is leaning into a a medicine cabinet mirror, dressed in a
text: crisp white shirt with his necktie thrown over his right shoulder. He is carefully clipping
text: his nosehairs with a small Hoffritz scissors.
text: We hear a banging at the door.
dialog: Margaret
text: If Nick doesn’t hurry up he’s going to miss the bus.
dialog: Gardner
text: Ill drop him on the way to the train.
text: THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE
text: Gardner leans in shrugging on his topcoat.
dialog: 22
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Come on Nick! Get the lead out.
speaker_heading: THE STREET
text: Gardner pulls Nicky briskly down the street. Gardner is carrying a leather attaché case.
text: Nick carries a lunchbox.
text: Gardner turns off the sidewalk to cut through a neighboring golf course.
scene_heading: THE GOLF COURSE
text: As Nick and Gardner cross a green. Gardner is setting a brisk pace, now several yards in
text: front of Nickey.
text: It is early morning. The light is soft and low ground fog still covers the golf course.
text: Gardner pauses at the top of a rise to wait for Nick.
text: As Nick approaches we hear a sudden chicha-chicha-chicha as a dozen automatic
text: sprinklers sprout on the fairway below. The mist from the sprinklers halates in the early
dialog: sun.
text: Nick pauses beside Gardner. Gardner puts a hand on top of the boy’s head as they both
text: stare down at the sprinklers, the one holding a briefcase, the other a lunchbox.
text: After a long beat:
dialog: Gardner
dialog: God, life is a joke.

dialog: Passenger
dialog: Gardner, welcome back.
text: He grabs Gardners hand and presses it between both of his.
dialog: 23
dialog: ... Sorry to hear about your loss.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Thanks Roger.
text: Roger shifts awkwardly, then indicates the younger executive he entered with.
dialog: Roger
text: Gardner, this is Robert Hughes, a new account executive.
dialog: Bob, this is Gardner Lodge, financial v.p.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Glad to meet you.
dialog: Robert Hughes
dialog: Likewise. Sorry we couldn’t have met under more, uh. . .
dialog: Roger
dialog: (jumping in)
text: Scooting up to eight to introduce Bob to the Maniacs. . .
text: He glances at his watch.
dialog: ... Damn. Trouble with those Creative people is they’re

text: Linda, the secretary outside of Gardner’s office, is just getting to her feet.
dialog: Linda
dialog: I’m so sorry, Mr. Lodge.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Thanks, Linda.
dialog: Linda
dialog: I’m so sorry.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: What do we have today?
dialog: 24
dialog: Linda
dialog: Nothing right away. Mr. Pappas would like to see you
dialog: whenever. . . well, whenever. . .
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: TRACKING
text: Through a lavishly appointed executive suite. A logo on the wall reads "Pappas &
dialog: Swain".
text: A tall, deeply tanned man is walking towards the camera with his arms extended for an
dialog: embrace.
text: Gardner extends his hand to be shaken.
text: Ed Pappas smoothly avoids trouble by bringing his hands together to wrap around
text: Gardner’s, then turns and drapes an arm around Gardner’s shoulder and leads him away.
dialog: Pappas
dialog: Gardner. So sorry to hear about your loss.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Thanks, Ed.
dialog: Pappas
dialog: Yeah, well come inside. We’ll have a talk. Hold my calls,
dialog: Virginia.
speaker_heading: PAPPAS’S OFFICE
text: Gardner is sitting into a chair that faces the large mahogany desk; Pappas perches on the
text: edge of the desk facing Gardner. He looks at Gardner. Gardner looks at him. There is a
text: long, awkward silence.
text: Finally Pappas brings his fist up to chest level and gives it a short, emphatic wave,
text: smiling.
dialog: Pappas
dialog: Yeah.
text: There is another pause. After a moment he repeats the gesture and phrase
dialog: 25
dialog: ... Yeah.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: I’m fine, Ed.
dialog: Pappas
dialog: Yeah, I know it...
text: Still wearing an encouraging smile:
dialog: ... Okay, lets go! We’re in there with ya.
text: He gives his fist another emphatic shake:
dialog: ... We’re in there.
dialog: Another silence.
text: Gardner rises.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Thanks, Ed.
text: Pappas beams.
dialog: Pappas
dialog: Okay!
speaker_heading: GARDNER’S OFFICE
text: He sits behind his desk, staring off into space. After a long moment the intercom buzzes
text: and he leans forward.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: Linda’s Voice
dialog: Phil Bigelow on seven.
text: Gardner hits a button on the phone and leans back with the receiver.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Hi, Phil.
dialog: 26
dialog: Voice
dialog: Gardner. No bullshit, just heartfelt condolences.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Thanks, Phil.
dialog: Voice
dialog: Right. I won’t keep you, just hang in there.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Right.
text: He hangs up.
text: He looks off into space.
text: Another intercom buzz.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: Linda’s Voice
dialog: John Sears on six.
text: He punches a phone button and leans back with the receiver.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: John.
dialog: Agitated Voice
dialog: Gardner, Jesus, how are you?
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Well —
dialog: Agitated Voice
dialog: I’m so goddamn sorry, I... 1...
text: There is a long silence. Finally:
dialog: —Oh, God, Gardner, I don’t know what to say!
dialog: Gardner
dialog: That’s all right, John.
dialog: 27
dialog: Agitated Voice
dialog: God, Gardner!
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Thanks, John.
text: Sears’ voice continues, faint and tinny, as Gardner leans forward to cradle the phone.
text: He hits the intercom switch.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Hold my calls, Linda.
dialog: Linda’s Voice
dialog: Yes sir.
text: He sinks wearily back into his chair.
text: His eyes close. A tear runs down his cheek.
text: As he has rocked back in his chair, his feet under the desk dangle above the floor.
text: More tears drop from under his closed eyes. Suddenly his eyes open. He looks down at
text: his desk.
text: He opens a top drawer and takes out two spring-tension hand grips. He starts squeezing
text: them, one in each hand.
text: We are wide on the office as Gardner settles back in his chair, once again closing his
text: eyes, still weeping, holding his hands out at either side and squeezing the grips, his feet
dialog: dangling.
text: The only sound over the drone of the air-conditioner is the squeak-squeak-squeak of the
text: spring grips.
text: There is a harsh buzz from the intercom.
text: Gardner leans for the intercom. Hoarsely:
dialog: Gardner
dialog: No calls, Linda.
dialog: Linda’s Voice
dialog: Sorry Mr. Lodge, but I thought you might want this one.
dialog: 28
text: The Rowahton police department.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: ... Okay, I'll take it.
text: He sets the grips down on the desktop and rubs his eyes, trying to compose himself. He
text: picks up the phone.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Yes?
dialog: Voice
dialog: Mr. Lodge?
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Yes?
dialog: Voice
text: This is Officer Gale Hightower of the Rowahton P.D.
dialog: Right off the bat I gotta tell ya I’m sorry about your wife.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Thank you—
dialog: Hightower
dialog: The other thing is I got a couple guys here I’d like you to
dialog: look at. Stamford police picked ’em up last night and sent
dialog: ’em down here ‘cause they more or less fit your
text: description, male Hispanic and a white guy—
dialog: Gardner
dialog: They’ve been caught?!
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Now don’t get too anxious there, Mr. Lodge; nobody’s
dialog: been caught unless you say they have. These are just two
text: clowns picked up for trying to kill each other, just a brawl,
dialog: but, ya know. ..
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Well. . . what do you want me to do?
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Take a look at em. Ya know, if you’d be so kind and all
dialog: that. . .
dialog: 29
text: Gardner stares blankly down at the top of the desk.
dialog: ... You still there pal?
dialog: Gardner
dialog: It'll... it’ll take me a little while to get there.
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Hey, they ain’t going anywhere.
speaker_heading: PRECINCT HOUSE
text: Gardner sits in a folding chair in the precinct waiting room. A black hand enters frame,
text: extended for a handshake.
dialog: Voice
dialog: Mr. Lodge? Lt. Hightower.
text: Gardner looks up at the tall middle-aged black man and smiles weakly. Hightower’s
text: hand is still extended.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: You’re, uh—
dialog: Hightower
dialog: I’m the law around here. Go ahead, it won’t rub off.
text: Gardner hastily rises and reaches for the hand.
scene_heading: PULLING GARDNER AND HIGHTOWER
text: They walk down a busy corridor in the police station.
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Hate to go over old ground, but are you sure there wasn’t
dialog: any cash in the house the night of the break-in?
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Hardly any. Why?
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Well, these two morons had a lot of dough on ’em when
dialog: 30
dialog: they were picked up. Especially the male Hispanic. Well
dialog: they’re both males. Hey Mr. Lodge, you’re brother-in-law,
dialog: um...
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Mitch? Egan?
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Yeah, he—very well-intentioned, I’m sure, but—he’s
dialog: called a few times, check on the progress, offer some
dialog: suggestions—
dialog: Gardner
dialog: He used to be a cop.
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Uh-huh, he mentioned that. Seven or eight times. Used the
dialog: words “professional courtesy” maybe what, ten or twelve
dialog: times. The point is, I always try to be polite. I’m a public
dialog: servant, you know. But you’re brother-in-law is a fucking
dialog: pain in the ass.
dialog: Gardner
text: Vl... Pl get him to calm down.
dialog: Hightower
dialog: You know, that would be very helpful. So okay, so these
dialog: two schmeggegges—that’s what you call ’em, right?
dialog: Gardner
dialog: What? I’m... I’m Episcopalian.
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Yeah whatever, if you could just take a look. I had a squad
dialog: car pick up your sister-in-law too. . .
text: Hightower is just opening a door to a small room with a glass wall at one end.
text: Margaret, a worried expression on her face, stands holding Nicky’s hand, next to a police
dialog: Hightower
dialog: 31
dialog: ... [thought she should see this. By the way, sorry about
dialog: your wife. I mentioned that, right?
text: Gardner looks down at Nicky and freezes. He looks up at Margaret.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Are you crazy?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: He was afraid to stay home alone.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: (to Hightower)
dialog: Must he be subjected to this?
text: Hightower shrugs.
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Beats me. How ya doing, junior?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Okay.
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Wanna wait outside for a few minutes?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: I’m okay.
text: Hightower looks at Gardner and shrugs again.
dialog: Hightower
dialog: I think it’s okay.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Well I don’t think it’s okay! I don’t think it’s okay that
dialog: he’s been having nightmares! I don’t think it’s okay that he
dialog: should have to see these people again! Are you people
dialog: sadists down here?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: I don’t mind looking at ‘em, Dad.
text: Gardner stares at Hightower. The policeman sighs, stretches his hand out to Nicky.
dialog: 32
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Better wait out in the hall, kid. We’ll only be a minute.
text: He leads Nicky out the door of the viewing room, shuts it behind him.
dialog: . .. Kids love police work, what can I tell ya. Why don’t
dialog: you folks sit down.
text: As they do so, Hightower cuts the light in the viewing room and speaks through the
text: intercom next to the light panel.
dialog: . .. Ready for the swimsuit competition.
text: The glass wall to the far side of the room shows a brightly lit platform, a door at the back
text: of which is now being opened by a uniformed policeman. Six bored-looking men enter
text: and mill vaguely about.
dialog: Hightower
dialog: (into the intercom)
dialog: Just line up on that black tape on the floor, gentlemen.
dialog: They fall in.
text: Gardner looks.
text: Ira Sloan and Luis Colina are among the six men, Luis Colina now with a discolored eye,
text: Ira Sloan with a splinted middle finger.
text: As Gardner continues to look through the glass without any visible reaction, we hear a
text: door opening. A wedge of light opens across the darkened viewing room. The forms of
text: Hightower, Gardner, Margaret and the police matron are reflected in the glass that
text: separates the two rooms.
text: Up on the platform, Ira Sloan raises his hand to shield his eyes from the overheads,
text: squinting out at the viewing room.
text: Hightower calls over his shoulder:
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Keep it shut please. . .
text: He turns to look back up at the platform. He hits the intercom.
dialog: ... Could we offer you some opera glasses?
dialog: 33
text: Ira Sloan drops his hand from his eyes, pausing to curl a fist and show his splintered
text: middle finger to the policeman.
text: The viewing-room door is easing shut on its hydraulic stop. Nicky now stands just inside
text: the door, against the back wall of the room.
text: The viewing room returns to semi-darkness as the door closes; the backs of the heads of
text: his father and aunt and the policeman are foreground silhouettes blocking his view of the
text: brightly lit line-up
dialog: Hightower
dialog: (to Gardner)
dialog: Well... ?
text: Gardner shakes his head.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: No.
text: Nicky rises to his tip-toes to get a better view.
dialog: Hightower
dialog: ...Ma’am?
text: Nicky shifts and cranes his neck.
text: The line-up is now in view. Ira Sloan and Luis Colina, looking bored, gaze out.
text: Nicky’s eyes widen. He looks at his father, opens his mouth to speak, is interrupted:
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Turn to your right, fellas. .. You in the middle, speak
dialog: English? Your right. El righto, get me?
text: He turns from the intercom to Margaret, waiting for her confirmation. She still sits mute.
text: Gardner too looks at her, expectantly.
text: Hightower turns up a palm.
dialog: . .. Come on dear, you’re not picking out wallpaper.
text: Margaret turns and looks at him levelly.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: 34
dialog: No. They’re not there. I just wanted to be sure.
text: Nicky, astounded, looks from her to his father.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Dad. ..?
text: Gardner turns abruptly to see Nicky for the first time.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: What’re you doing here?
text: He turns to Hightower:
dialog: ... What is he doing in here?
text: He strides over to Nicky:
dialog: ...Come on. This isn’t for you.
text: Hightower glances casually back over his shoulder, then looks at the matron.
dialog: Hightower
dialog: Sarah, take him out and keep him out, will ya? And you
dialog: stick around, Mr. L.
text: He leans back to the intercom
text: The policewoman takes Nicky’s hand and starts leading him out of the room. Nicky
text: looks back over his shoulder.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Dad. .. I gotta...
dialog: Hightower
dialog: No winners tonight. Sorry boys, I know how bad you
dialog: wanted that scholarship —
text: We are tracking back out of the viewing room. Hightower is hunched over his intercom.
text: Gardner stands rooted to the spot, staring at Nicky. Beyond him the line-up men are
text: filing out the platform door.
text: In the foreground the viewing-room door hisses shut on its stop.
dialog: 35
speaker_heading: CAR
text: Nicky sits in the front seat between Gardner, driving, and Margaret. For a long while
text: nobody speaks and we hear only the drone of the engine. Nicky, motionless, stares
text: straight ahead through the windshield. Finally, looking as they pass a gas station:
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Never thought I’d live to see the day gas hit three dollars.
text: More driving in silence.
dialog: Then:
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Mrs. Najarian sent some flowers.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: She’s s fine woman. . . We owe the Najarians a dinner.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: The Stouts also.
dialog: Gardner
text: Not on the same night, though. Herb and Thayer don’t get
dialog: along.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Oh. Well just let me know when you think it’s proper to
dialog: start entertaining. . . I was just rereading some of "Life
dialog: Races"—that book you gave me.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Yeah, Dr., uh. . .
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Evan Maslansky. You know how he talks about life being
dialog: a series of races, where you have to triumph in each one
dialog: before you proceed to the next.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Evan said that when you find a terrible hurdle in one of
dialog: your Life Races, you can either remove it or choose another
dialog: 36
dialog: Life Race...
text: She looks cautiously at Nicky, who does not seem to be listening.
dialog: ... Well I just think we are being tested, Gardner.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: —Hmm? I’m sorry, I wasn’t listening.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Well. . . I was just rambling, I guess.
text: Silence. Finally, as they pass another gas station.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: I'll tell you one thing. I never thought I’d see gas hit three
dialog: dollars.
text: Nicky suddenly lunges across Margaret’s lap and claws for the handle of her door.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Nicky! What the hell are you —
dialog: Margaret
speaker_heading: ANGEL!
text: Gardner, not understanding what is going on, has not slowed the car. As Nicky’s feet
text: unintentionally kick at him, he fights to control the car.
text: Nicky starts vomiting into Margaret’s lap.
speaker_heading: LUIS COLINA

dialog: Well shit, man—
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: No, I’m serious. That’s a violation.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Well—I saw it was you, man! I’m gonna not answer?
dialog: Thass not good either.

scene_heading: LUIS COLINA’S APARTMENT
text: We push over Luis Colina’s shoulder as he pushes open a door to enter an apartment that
text: is a pandemonium of children yelling (the older ones) and bawling (the younger). A
text: diapered child sits in the middle of the living room banging on the floor with a dirty

text: An Hispanic woman screams:

dialog: ... Come on in.
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: Hey Luis.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Mi casa es su casa.
text: Gombrich enters, looking around.
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: No thanks. Where you been, Luis?
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Oh, you know.
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: What the fuck does that mean?

dialog: kiddies.
text: A hoot from the woman.
text: Gombrich nods, still gazing around.
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: Great, that’s great...

text: hands it to Luis.
dialog: . .. So you weren’t down at the Rowahton precinct house
dialog: this morning?
text: Luis Colina stares at him.
text: A beat.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Well yeah I was there.
dialog: Beat.
text: ... Briefly.
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: Yeah, you fuckin’ lie to me about where you been—
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: I didn’t lie, man! It was, you know, beneath notice!
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: Beneath notice. Are you gonna pee in that or what.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Yeah, it was all a fucking mistake, they bring us in—they
dialog: bring me in for a line-up, some crazy shit that wasn’t me in

dialog: Gardner
dialog: So how’re you feeling, son?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: I’m okay.
text: Gardner looks awkwardly around, then perches on the edge of the toilet.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Fine, fine. It’s been a rough day. How was your little

dialog: Nicky
dialog: I guess it was okay. I worked on my stance.
dialog: 
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Well good. That’s fine. That’s just fine...

dialog: Gardner
dialog: Nicky, did you see the line-up?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: I saw—
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Because that certainly was not the. . . robbers. It certainly
dialog: was not.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: But —
dialog: Gardner
dialog: 
dialog: Young man, I want you to understand something. People
dialog: walk into my office every day who say they’ve met me and
dialog: I don’t remember them at all. . .
dialog: He works himself up:
dialog: . .. Sometimes I see people I think I know and yet they tell
dialog: me later that we’ve never even met. Maybe they look like
text: someone else, maybe they talk like someone else, maybe
dialog: they’re related—
dialog: Nicky
dialog: But Dad, I —
dialog: Gardner
dialog: My point is that it’s a very shady business, this who you
dialog: know and who you don’t know, often one is mistaken—
dialog: very much mistaken and--and I’m telling you I got a good
dialog: look at those clowns and I’d never seen them before.

dialog: Uncle Mitch promised if I ever—
text: Gardner’s voice rises, almost breaks:
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Uncle Mitch doesn’t matter! He’s a buffoon!
text: Nicky shrinks.
text: Gardner brings himself up short and composes himself. Noticing that his glasses are
text: fogged he removes them and takes a handkerchief out of his pocket.
text: Nicky watches. From somewhere downstairs, we hear Margaret starting to sing. Her
text: voice, filtering up into the utter quiet of the bathroom, has an eerie clarity. She is singing
dialog: "Please Release Me."
text: Gardner starts to clean his glasses, the handkerchief squeaking against the glass.
dialog: ... This is a family matter, and I don’t want you talking to
dialog: Uncle Mitch about it. Is that understood.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Yes sir.
text: Gardner turns to leave.

dialog: Gardner
dialog: What’re you talking about, I’m not going to just knuckle
dialog: under to these clowns. They’re goddamn bus drivers. You
dialog: let me worry about them.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: But if they say we have to do something about Nicky, then
dialog: don’t we have to do something?
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Maggie, do you know what they mean by "do something"?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Well, I don’t know. They don’t mean Valley Forge,

dialog: Gardner
dialog: No they don’t.

dialog: Gardner
dialog: Shutup with that Life Race garbage! It’s what got us into
dialog: this mess in the first place!
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Please don’t be angry with me Gardner. . .
dialog: Gardner
dialog: I’m not angry with you.
text: Margaret breaks down and sobs quietly.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: I didn’t mean to bring him to the station. It’s just that there
dialog: were all those officers in the house all of a sudden. . . I
dialog: didn’t want to disobey the officers. . . Please don’t be angry
dialog: with me.
text: Gardner looks at her, still whimpering. His manner softens. She is so vulnerable.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Give me strength, Maggie.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: We'll give each other strength. . .

dialog: Janssen
dialog: Sure. Come back when you got the money, I give you the

dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Yeah but, see, thing is, I need the piece to get the money.

dialog: Man
dialog: Oh my.

dialog: Margaret
dialog: Thank you for stopping by, Mr Clark—

dialog: Clark
dialog: Kenneth is fine.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Yes—I’m quite sure we have all the insurance we need—
dialog: Clark
dialog: I’m sure you do, but fact is I’m not a salesman; I’m here to
dialog: discuss your sister’s policy.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Oh! Well. . . you’ll have to talk to Gardner about that.
dialog: He’ll be home this evening; he has all the information on
dialog: that.
dialog: Clark
dialog: Could I just come in for asecond? Awful wet out here.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Well. . . I don’t have any of the information. . .

dialog: Clark
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: I’m sorry, it’s a lovely rug.
text: Margaret bustles back in, carrying an old sheet. She walks over to where Clark sits on
dialog: the couch.
dialog: 77
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Could you get up for just a moment?
dialog: Clark
dialog: Oh, I’m sorry.
text: He helps her drape the sheet over the couch, then sits back down again. Margaret sits
text: down on the edge of a chair opposite Clark.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: I haven’t the faintest idea how I can help you, since I don’t
dialog: have any of the information, but, uh. . . What is it exactly
dialog: that you do for the insurance people?
dialog: Clark
dialog: Oh, I guess my official title is Claims Investigator, what
dialog: you might call a professional skeptic.
text: Margaret gives a little titter to acknowledge his smile.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Well I’m afraid I. . . is there something wrong with the
dialog: policy?
dialog: Clark
dialog: No no no no, the policy seems to be all ship-shape; Mr.
dialog: Lodge’s been very steady with the payments; your agent,
dialog: um...
text: He gropes for the name.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Mr. Rosenblum?
dialog: Clark
dialog: Right, Bobby Rosenblum, he tells me everything’s in order.
dialog: Have you met him?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: No, I really don’t know anything about Gardner’s business
dialog: affairs. That’s why I’m afraid I can’t—
dialog: Clark
dialog: Well I wouldn’t worry overmuch about "information", Miss
dialog: Egan, because people always put information in quotes. . .
dialog: 78
text: He makes quotation marks in the air with his fingers.
dialog: ... but it isn’t always like that. I mean people just don’t
dialog: realize how much they know; for instance, you happen to
dialog: know the agent’s name. ..
text: He is opening his attache case.
dialog: ... [have all that information here.
text: He puts on a pair of glasses and flips through papers.
dialog: ... I’m really more interested in the other kind. . .
text: Absently, as he continues reading.
text: ... Which all really boils down. .. to one... word. .. Do
dialog: you live here now, Miss Egan?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: (uneasy)
dialog: Well I’m here now, of course.
dialog: Clark
dialog: Is that a temporary or a permanent arrangement?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: I... [think that Nicky needs a mother.
dialog: Clark
dialog: Of course.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: What. . . what was the word?
dialog: Clark
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: You said it all boiled down to one word?
dialog: Clark
text: ...DidI? Ohyeah. Coincidence. That’s what it all boils
dialog: down to. Yeah, it happens a lot in the opera.
dialog: 79
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Does it?
dialog: Clark
dialog: Sure, Aida, Barber of Seville, it’s just. . . It gets ridiculous.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: I’m not much of a—
dialog: Clark
dialog: But in real life it doesn’t happen much. If it did, I guess
dialog: it’d stop being a coincidence. It’s not the policy, Miss
dialog: Egan; it’s the claim. Ya see, a coincidence on a claim, it’s
text: like a little red flag that makes us sit up and take notice.
dialog: And this claim has a bunch of little red flags on it.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Good heavens—
dialog: Clark
dialog: Nothing to worry about, believe me, I’m just here to chase
dialog: down all those flags, very routine. We just have to have
dialog: them explained before we send out a check. The claim will
dialog: be honored, of course. To the penny.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Oh, that’s good.
dialog: Clark
dialog: Oh sure. Let’s just take a look here. See, the first little red
dialog: flag I noticed was that—March 3rd—about three months
dialog: before the, uh, incident—the amount of the term part of the
dialog: policy was substantially increased, but there was no
dialog: increase on the whole life, kind of unusual, I don’t suppose
dialog: you know anything about—
dialog: Margaret
dialog: That was Gardner’s idea.
dialog: Clark
dialog: It was, huh? Well I guess I’d better ask him about that this
dialog: evening. What else have we got here, we’ve got. .. Oh
dialog: yeah, more than one claim on a policy, that’s always a little
dialog: 80
dialog: red flag, we’ve got that claim from “96, Rose’s car
dialog: accident, you stung us good on that one, well that’s okay,
dialog: that’s what we’re here for—Oh! Here’s a little red flag,
dialog: didn’t even notice this before. Jeez, about five months ago
dialog: Mr. Lodge redeems twenty thousand worth of his whole
dialog: life policy with us, we always like to notice things like that,
dialog: but I guess you know what he need the money for?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Oooh!
text: She has just noticed Nicky sitting on the staircase, his face pressed between two
text: balusters, watching.
text: Margaret dashes to the stairs, takes Nicky by the hand and leads him up towards the
text: bedrooms. Clark saunters over to wait for her at the foot of the stairs. He looks this way
text: and that, glances at his watch.
text: Margaret descends the stairs, alone, and tentative.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: I’m sorry, that was money for Nicky’s college education.
text: Clark nods sympathetically.
dialog: Clark
dialog: College and orthodontia, they really kill ya.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: He has excellent teeth.
dialog: Clark
dialog: Well thank God for that. I guess he put it in a trust fund or
dialog: something?
text: Margaret gropes.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Would you like a cup of coffee?
dialog: Clark
dialog: That would be absolutely terrific.
text: She is heading for the kitchen. Clark idly follows her, chatting on.
dialog: 81
dialog: ... [don’t suppose you know where that account is?—Well
dialog: it doesn’t matter, I’l] ask Mr. Lodge about that one. . .
dialog: Sorry to be such a pest, I mean this stuff isn’t very
dialog: important. But I’1l tell ya, I could put you on the floor with
dialog: some of the scams I’ve seen and I’m talking about real
dialog: knee-slappers, I gotta smile just thinking about “em. . .
text: He starts to laugh.
text: Margaret looks at him.
text: He laughs harder.
text: Margaret starts laughing with him.
dialog: ... [mean I had a guy couple years ago puts in a claim for
dialog: his clothing store burned down, you’re not gonna believe
dialog: this, we find a couple gas cans in there with Eula May
dialog: printed on ’em, his own wife’s name, it’s the name of his
dialog: pleasure boat where he got the cans from.
text: He laughs heartily.
dialog: ... he thought those aluminum cans were gonna burn up or
dialog: something, I don’t know what he thought. . .
text: Margaret laughs with him.
dialog: ...and cars! Thank you...
text: He takes the cup of coffee from Margaret and leans against the wall, sipping from it.
dialog: ... You wouldn’t believe what people do to their cars just
dialog: because something’s a little wrong with the transmission
dialog: and they figure they can fleece us for the whole thing. Sell
dialog: em for scrap, report ‘em stolen, but the body shop guy
dialog: knows we pay a bounty for those things. . .
dialog: 
text: As he laughs a little coffee dribbles out of his mouth down his chin. He smears it away
text: with one hand.
dialog: ... Excuse me. Anyway...
text: He sighs.
dialog: 82
dialog: ... Yeah, you been in this business as long as I have, you
dialog: develop a nose for hanky-panky. Because it smells, ya
dialog: know, it has this. . .
text: He flutters his hand.
dialog: ... faint aroma. This smells bad, that smells good—you
dialog: know what I mean. But this one—this particular case here
text: doesn’t have that faint aroma.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Thank goodness for that.
text: Clark nods, still smiling pleasantly
dialog: Clark
dialog: ... Nah, this one stinks. This one, I’ve been smelling this
dialog: one since I got off the turnpike. Jesus does it stink. Ya
dialog: sleep with Gardner, do ya?
text: Margaret stares at him. He continues, affably:
dialog: ... Well, that’s none of my business. But I gotta tell ya,
dialog: this kind of nonsense, it can come back to haunt you down
dialog: the road. Ya see, all the insurance companies. . .
text: He laces his fingers together.
dialog: ... are like one big interlocking network. We all share our
dialog: files, you won’t be able to buy yourself a policy at any
dialog: price. And that’s serious. I mean, you could go to jail for
dialog: the rest of your life and have a shit credit rating.
text: He sets his coffee cup down on the counter and turns to go.
dialog: ... On the other hand, it could be worse. They haven’t
dialog: executed anyone in this state in over thirty years.
text: Margaret stares as we hear Clark’s footsteps receding down the hall.
dialog: ... Tell Mr. Lodge that I’ll be back this evening. I’d like to
text: visit with him for a while too.
text: We hear the front door opening.
dialog: 83
dialog: ... Hope I didn’t get the couch wet.

text: Margaret, still snuffling, enters with two coffee cups on saucers. She hands one to
dialog: Gardner, one to Clark.
dialog: Clark
dialog: Thanks.
text: Margaret leaves.
dialog: ... you don’t have any choice. I think, amoment’s
dialog: reflection, you can figure that out for yourself and then we

text: Gardner licks his lips.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: ... If we did. . . if we did kill my wife, what makes you
dialog: think I won’t kill you?
text: Clark sadly shakes his head.
dialog: Clark
dialog: Mr. Lodge, are you crazy? You think I’m the only

dialog: you have any idea what happens when an investigator
dialog: 89
dialog: who’s working on a case like this dies? _Haven’t you

text: He takes a sip of coffee.
dialog: ... Believe me, if anything happens to me, you’re in deep,

text: Gardner’s legs are leaving, the poker down at his side.
scene_heading: SUBURBAN STREET
dialog: 91
text: Gardner runs down the street. Ahead in the dark we can make out Clark’s form as he
text: staggers crazily away, struggling out of his suit coat, clawing at his throat, his white shirt
text: flashing. Gardner shoots an apprehensive glance at the dark houses.
text: Clark staggers, sucking for air that won’t burn. He is slowing, his gait becoming ever
text: more herky-jerky.
text: Gardner overtakes him and, from behind, swings the golfclub with a whoosh at the
text: insurance man’s head.
text: On the thud, we cut.
speaker_heading: STAIRS
text: Nicky descends cautiously, quietly, a step at a time. From somewhere—not from him—a
text: whimpering sound.
text: Margaret comes into view at the far end of the living room. She is stooped over, picking
text: up pieces of broken china, putting them into a cupped palm, whimpering.
text: A creak in the stair—she notices Nicky, straightens, and moans:
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Ohhh, Nicky. . .
text: Nicky heads for the front door, which stands open.
text: She drops the collected china and grabs the shovel off the fireplace rack, but her manner
dialog: remains unthreatening:
dialog: ... No, Nicky, wait.
text: But he is running.
text: She runs awkwardly after, raising the shovel.
speaker_heading: PORCH
text: Nicky is off and away.
text: Margaret emerges onto the porch but clearly will not catch him; she stops at the lip of the
dialog: porch.
dialog: 92
dialog: Margaret
dialog: No, angel!
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Minutes later. Margaret sits in the easy chair formerly occupied by the insurance man,
text: sobbing, as Gardner enters.
text: His voice is dull:
dialog: Gardner
text: I put him in the car.
text: He looks at her crying.
text: ... It’s falling apart, Maggie. It’s over. All over.
text: She shakes her head, still weeping.
dialog: ... We’ll have to go away.
text: His gaze drifts off, up the stairs.
dialog: ... Where’s Nicky?
dialog: Margaret sobs:
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Oh Gardner—he got away!
text: Gardner squints incomprehension.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: ... What’re you talking about "got away"?
dialog: Margaret
dialog: I tried to take care of it! I just—I just—I’m trying to
dialog: manage. . .
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Margaret—what’re you talking about?
dialog: 93
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Oh, Gardner!
speaker_heading: A MEZUZA
text: Tacked to a doorpost; it has ornate metalwork and Hebrew letters. We hear faint doorbell
text: chimes.
text: Wider shows Nicky, having just pressed the doorbell, looking up at the mezuza.
text: After a beat the front door swings open to reveal Sieglebaum in his pyjamas.
dialog: Sieglebaum
dialog: Holy moley! What’re you doing here Nicky?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Can I come in, Noah? My dad’s trying to kill me.
dialog: Sieglebaum
dialog: Oh. Okay.
speaker_heading: NOAH’S BEDROOM
text: The two boys sit on Noah’s bed in a small carpeted room littered with sporting gear and
dialog: electronic toys.
dialog: Sieglebaum
text: Inside is a little piece of parchment with the Sh’mah on it.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: What’s parchment?
dialog: Sieglebaum
dialog: I dunno. It’s old paper that the Pharaohs used. Are you
dialog: staying over?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Can I?
text: With a crash the door bursts open and Aaron, Sieglebaum’s thirteen-year-old brother,
text: strides in.
dialog: Aaron
dialog: 94
dialog: Where’s my Sega joystick you little faggot?
dialog: Noticing Nick:
dialog: —wWhat’s he doing here?
dialog: Sieglebaum
dialog: I didn’t touch your stupid—
text: Aaron has already grabbed Sieglebaum by the hair.
text: ... AHHHHHHHH. STOP! I DON’T HAVE YOUR—
speaker_heading: AHHHHHHH—
text: Aaron wrestles the flailing Sieglebaum to the ground and sits on top of his stomach,
text: pressing his thumbs into the soft spots behind Sieglebaum’s ears. He bellows:
dialog: Aaron
text: SAY "I’M A FAGGOT! I’M A FAGGOT!"
dialog: Sieglebaum
text: AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
text: He starts bouncing his brother’s head against the floor in time with his chant:
dialog: Aaron
text: "lM A FAGGOT! I’M A FAGGOT!"
text: We hear pounding footsteps and Nicky looks up from the fight as Mr. Sieglebaum
text: appears in the doorway.
dialog: Mr. Sieglebaum
dialog: Cut it out, Aaron.
text: He wades in to break up the fight. He hooks a hand under Aaron’s armpit and starts
text: leading him out of the room.
dialog: ... You know who’s room this is.
dialog: Aaron
dialog: Yeah well he’s been in my room, the little faggot.
dialog: Mr. Sieglebaum
dialog: Hey! Aaron!
dialog: 95
text: As he leads him out the door he nods at someone in the hall.
dialog: ... They’re in here.
text: They disappear around the corner.
text: Gardner appears in the doorway.
text: He and Nicky look at each other.
text: Gardner holds out his hand.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Come on, son.
text: Nicky remains sitting, staring.
dialog: ... Come on.
text: Nicky gets up, goes to his father, takes the extended hand.
scene_heading: LUIS COLINA’S APARTMENT EXTERIOR
text: Luis Colina is exiting the four-story apartment building holding a baseball bat. He
text: glances around as he heads for his car parked at the curb.
text: Halfway there a vibrating hum stops him. He fishes out his phone and squints at it:
dialog: Gombrich.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Shit.
text: He flips it open.
dialog: ... How ya doin’, man.
dialog: Gombrich’s Voice
dialog: Going to practice?
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 96
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: Going to batting practice?
text: Luis Colina looks wildly around. His look lands on:
text: A parked car, someone in it. Gombrich’s voice continues:
dialog: ... Yeah, come on over. Hop in.
speaker_heading: LODGE HOME
text: Nicky is walking up the stairs immediately in front of Gardner.
text: They go down the hall to his bedroom. As Nick is about to enter:
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Nicholas.
text: Nick turns, looks up.
dialog: ... Do you need the privvy?
dialog: Nicky
dialog: No.
text: Gardner nods solemnly.
text: He shuts the door behind Nick.
text: We hear a key turning in the door, and then retreating footsteps.
text: A sharp, thin tapping sound brings Nicky’s look around.
text: The cherry limb taps at the dark of his windowpane.
scene_heading: ERNIE GOMBRICH’S CAR
text: Gombrich looks over at Luis Colina as they drive down a suburban street. Gombrich
text: looks forward, shaking his head.
text: A long beat.
text: Luis Colina finally breaks the silence:
dialog: 97
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: You keep shaking your head, man. Iss freaking me out.
dialog: Ernie
dialog: I’ve tried to be a friend to you, Luis. You know—
dialog: supportive. And now this. And now this.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: And now this what, man?
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: Luis, I’m gonna tell you straight out. There was zinc in
dialog: your urine.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Zinc?
text: A perplexed beat.
dialog: ... Zine.
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: Yeah zinc.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: So, that means, what, I got a high zinc count or what.
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: Luis, lemme ’splain something. This is not natural levels
dialog: of zinc. Unless you’re the fucking Tin Man. You know.
dialog: Oil me.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Oil me?
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: This urine, lemme tell you about this urine. This is old
dialog: urine. This is stored-up urine. This is bullshit urine.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: No, this is my urine, man—
dialog: Gombrich
dialog: You are a goddamn three-time loser. I tried to warn you,
dialog: 98
dialog: three strikes you’re out. That’s how we play the game here
text: in the US of A. And I smell a whiffer. I smell a
dialog: goddamned whiffer. I red-tagged your file, Luis. We’re
dialog: going back to Attica.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: This was good urine, man.
dialog: Gombrich
text: WAKE UP, COLINA! YOU’RE GOING BACK TO THE
dialog: JOINT! YOU’RE—Humph!
text: Luis Colina has just socked him in the face.
dialog: . .. Fuck—shit—
text: Ernie Gombrich fights to control the car as Luis Colina grabs his head and slams it into
text: the wheel a couple of times, the car giving a brief honk at each impact.
text: Bumps, swerves, a big bump and a wrenching impact.
speaker_heading: EXTERIOR
text: The car has hit a lamppost.
text: Ernie Gombrich dribbles out of the driver’s side, moaning.
text: Luis Colina flings open the passenger door and emerges. He leans back in for his
text: baseball bat.
text: He rounds the car and starts whacking Ernie Gombrich’s head.
speaker_heading: MASTER BEDROOM
text: Margaret is in bed; Gardner sits on the edge of the bed in his shirtsleeves, elbows on his
text: knees, gazing at a spot on the floor.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: ... Aruba, I think.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Where is it?
dialog: 99
dialog: Gardner
dialog: The Carribean. It’s a Dutch protectorate, there’s no uh. .
dialog: reciprocal uh, extradition . . .
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Well, I don’t understand anything about that. Isn’t it—
dialog: Gardner
dialog: We could take a boat from another island, not leave a ticket
dialog: trail.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: ...Isn’t it spicy, mango food?
dialog: Gardner
dialog: You can get any sort of food. Food of any description.
text: There’s golfing. Couples golfing. The windsurfing. I
dialog: went with Rose, many times.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Well that’s good, darling. You could relax. You could
dialog: paint, express yourself. The artistic thing is important to
dialog: you. I loved Rose, but you need someone to help you
dialog: explore that side of yourself. . .
text: Gardner continues to stare at the floor, listening.
dialog: ... We should have done this a long time ago. You were
text: trapped at the agency, Gardner—this is for the best. . .
scene_heading: NICKY’S BEDROOM
text: Nicky sits in the dark, on his bed, knees drawn up to his chest.
text: Sharp and present, though not loud, is the tap at the window.
text: Muted by an intervening wall are the voices from next door, their tones matter-of-fact.
text: No words are discernible, only the lulling back-and-forth of male voice alternating with
dialog: female.
text: A new sound: from outside, the approaching rattle of a car whose fanbelt is rhythmically
text: slapping the engine block.
text: Nicky rises and goes to the window.
dialog: 100
text: Ernie Gombrich’s car is pulling to the curb across the street, its hood crumpled. Once it
text: is parked its engine sputters and dies out along with its associated coughs and clunks.
text: Nicky stares.
text: No one emerges from the car.
text: The muffled adult voices from the other bedroom drone on.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
scene_heading: NICKY’S BEDROOM
text: It is early morning. Nicky is still dressed but is now asleep on top of the bedcovers. The
text: clunk of a car door wakes him.
text: He goes to the window.
text: Gardner’s car is pulling out of the driveway.
text: The beat-up car at the curb across the street is still there. Once Gardner’s car has pulled
text: away, its door opens.
text: Luis Colina emerges.
text: Nicky’s eyes widen.
text: Luis Colina looks up the street in the direction in which Gardner’s car disappeared.
text: Satisfied that it is gone, he pulls a baseball bat from his car. He starts across the street.
text: Nicky goes to his bedroom door and pounds.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Aunt Margaret!
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: Margaret stands at the counter making scrambled eggs, glancing up occasionally at the
text: portable television.
dialog: Voice
dialog: It’s beautiful, Donna.
dialog: 101
dialog: Another Voice
text: The Butterfly Broach has a silver setting and five high-
dialog: quality zircon stones—
text: She reacts to the muffled pounding and shouting from upstairs:
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Just a minute!
scene_heading: MASTER BEDROOM/BATH
text: With the eggs between toast wedges on a small plate, Margaret walks through the
text: bedroom to the adjoining bathroom, humming to herself.
text: She sets the plate down next to the sink and opens the medicine cabinet.
text: She raises her voice in response to the continuing pounding:
dialog: Margaret
dialog: I’m just fixing your breakfast!
text: She takes a small vial out of the medicine cabinet and sprinkles the contents of the vial
text: onto the eggs. She uses the fork to mash it in. She picks up the plate.
text: She emerges from the bathroom and stops short, with a quick intake of breath.
text: Luis Colina stands in the bedroom doorway in his MTA uniform holding the baseball bat.
text: Margaret stares.
dialog: Margaret
dialog: Goodness. I don’t know what your business is here, but
dialog: you’ ll have to talk to Gardner.
text: Luis Colina steps hesitantly into the bedroom.
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: Sorry lady. Iss just the nature of the way things is.
scene_heading: NICKY’S BEDROOM
text: Nicky stops pounding at the sound of ascream. The scream ends in a dull thunking
dialog: 102
text: sound. Nicky listens at the door. A short beat. Two more dull thunks.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: Empty.
text: A silent beat.
text: Luis Colina emerges from the master bedroom holding the stained baseball bat. He
text: closes the door behind him.
text: We hold on the closed door as Luis Colina leaves frame. We hear him walking down the
text: hallway, opening and shutting doors.
scene_heading: NICKY’S BEDROOM
text: Muffled here, we hear Luis Colina’s progress in the hallway. Nicky stands with his ear
text: pressed to the door, struggling to control his frightened breathing.
text: The footsteps approach. . .
text: His own doorknob is rattled. A pause. Another rattle to confirm that it is locked.
text: A muffled voice:
dialog: Luis Colina
dialog: . Kid?
text: A THUMP at the door makes Nicky start. Another THUMP. It sounds like Luis Colina
text: is giving it the shoulder.
text: Nicky scrambles to his bed and under it.
text: His point-of-view from under the bed shows very little outside; a dust ruffle comes
text: almost to the floor.
text: The thumps continue, the very bottom of the door trembling with each one, but remaining
dialog: closed.
text: Finally with the sound of wood splintering around its lock, the door swings open.
text: A beat of quiet.
dialog: 103
text: Nicky tries to quiet his breathing.
text: A pair of black-shod feet enter, topped by blue uniform pants. The business side of a
text: baseball bat dangles next to his feet. It is smeared with blood. The feet take a couple of
text: hesitant steps in.
text: The man is pausing, looking around. His voice is clear now:
dialog: . Kid?
text: A couple more steps toward the bed; the room is not big. The feet are now planted
text: immediately in front of the bed.
text: Motion in the feet; the sound of knees cracking; the dust ruffle is plucked up so that Luis
text: Colina can peer in at us, his head angled sideways.
text: Nicky stares back.
text: After a long look, a smile from Luis Colina:
dialog: . Hi.
text: And then—oddly—he lets the dust ruffle drop. He is gone, but only for a moment:
text: His arm reaches in. It gropes blindly towards Nicky.
text: Nicky presses himself against the wall and starts screaming.
text: Just audible under the screams as the arm continues to grope:
dialog: ...C’mon kid... I’m sorry. Iss just how things is.
text: Nicky bats, screaming, at the groping hand, but now it closes over his upper arm,
text: tightens, and starts to drag him.
text: Nicky screams.
text: There is a dull crunching sound and the hand stops dragging. In fact, it relaxes.
text: There is another scream, not from Nicky.
text: There is another crunch that ends the scream, and then three more, at a measured pace, in
text: the silence that follows.
text: The hand is an inert thing. Blood is seeping into the carpet from beyond Luis Colina’s
dialog: 104
dialog: shoulder.
text: Suddenly the shoulder and arm slide away, dragged effortlessly, and the dust ruffle drops
text: back into place.
text: It is plucked up again and Uncle Mitch peers in.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: Nicky. ..
text: He helps Nicky scramble out and then scoops him up and tucks Nicky’s head into his
text: shoulder as he jogs him out the bedroom door.
text: ... Don’t look, Nicky, don’t look. . . It’s a mess. . .
text: He lumbers down the stairs, stroking the back of Nicky’s head.
dialog: . .. Was that one of the cocksuckas?
text: Nicky sobs.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Yes! Daddy’s a cocksucker too!
speaker_heading: HOUSE EXTERIOR
text: Mitch, grim-faced, jogs Nicky down the lawn to where his car is parked.
text: As Mitch stoops to ease Nicky into the passenger side:
dialog: Mitch
dialog: I’m takin’ you home, Nicky. My home. Ow-uh home...
text: Having deposited the boy he straightens.
dialog: ... On the way you can tell me wusco non...
text: He goes around the car and pops the trunk.
dialog: ... and I’ll take care of everything.
text: The trunk holds security paraphernalia including walkie-talkies and clubs
text: and a snap-flap holster which he grabs. There is also a small case. Mitch
dialog: 105
text: pops its clasps. Inside is a handgun.
dialog: . .. Uncle Mitch’Il take care of it.
speaker_heading: GARDNER’S OFFICE
text: Gardner is striding for his office; his secretary rises to greet him:
dialog: Linda
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Lodge, you’re early today—you don’t
dialog: have anything until ten.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: I’m sorry, Linda, you’re going to have to cancel everything
dialog: today, I’ve just come in to pick up a few things. . .
text: He opens the inner-office door but pauses in the doorway to continue:
dialog: ... See if you can get Erwin Panofsky at First Hartford on
dialog: the line before I go, I need to talk to him about some fund
dialog: transfers, and then I’1l need—
text: His eyes widen, reacting to something oncoming a split second before Mitch’s back
text: enters frame and he is muscled backwards into his office.
dialog: Mitch
text: SCUMBAGS!... SCUMBAGS!. .. 1 WANT HIS NAME!
text: Linda, standing in the doorway with her notepad and pencil, emits sharp, chirping
text: screams.
text: Mitch slaps Gardner forehand and backhand.
dialog: ... L|WANT HIS SCUMBAG NAME!
text: His hand closes around Gardner’s throat and he shakes him by his neck. Gardner
text: struggles to get the words out:
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Luis. . . Luis Colina.
text: Mitch’s veins are popping, his face is beet red, he is screaming:
dialog: 106
dialog: Mitch
text: I KILT THE FUCKIN SPIC! I WANT THE UDDA ONE!
text: Linda’s high piping screams continue, ignored by the two men.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Ira. . . Ira Sloan.
text: Mitch hurls Gardner across the room where he lands in a heap.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: T’ll be back fa you!
scene_heading: TONY JANSON’S APARTMENT
text: Ira Sloan is on the phone in the apartment of the gun salesman down the hall.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Ain’t back yet?! When he leave?
text: Barely audible, filtered through the phone, we hear a woman’s voice and the
text: pandemonium of children.
text: From somewhere more present, a muffled buzz.
text: Ira Sloan sticks a finger in his ear.
dialog: ...Tcan’t hear you, ya wha?. .. Yeah, I know where he
dialog: went, I’m the one who sent him, but why ain’t he back?
text: Two muffled buzzes in quick succession.
text: Tony Janson is at a table, a beer in front of him.
dialog: Tony
dialog: That your buzzer?
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: When he gets back you tell him to call me. Fuck, he can’t
dialog: call me.
text: Another muffled buzz. Tony raises his voice to Ira Sloan:
dialog: 107
dialog: Tony
dialog: Somebody’s ringin’ your apartment.
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Tell him he—wait, maybe this’s him.—
text: He lowers the phone mouthpiece to address Tony:
dialog: Can you buzz’em in?
text: Tony goes to an intercom by his open apartment door and holds down a button. We hear
text: a heavy door unlatching down the hall. Ira Sloan is back into the telephone:
dialog: ... 1 said maybe that’s—can you hear me? Put a cork
dialog: innose kids why don’t ya...
text: Mitch clomps by in the hallway, some kind of aerosol in one hand, eyes taking in the
text: number on the open apartment door and flitting without interest over Ira Sloan and Tony
text: Janson as he passes.
text: Ira Sloan and Tony Janson exchange a look. Ira Sloan hesitates at the phone.
dialog: . Uh... nev mind. Gubbye.
text: Ira Sloan carefully cradles the phone. We hear pounding on a doorway down the hall.
dialog: Mitch’s Voice
dialog: Hello. .. Ya deh?
text: More pounding.
dialog: ... Open iss daw!
text: Ira Sloan clears his throat. He asks quietly:
dialog: Ira Sloan
dialog: Can I have a beer?
text: Tony Janson is puzzled.
dialog: Tony
dialog: A beer.
dialog: 108
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: At the end of the hall Mitch is a small figure pounding on Ira Sloan’s door, his back to us.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: I know ya indeh ya fuckin scumbag, open is fuckin daw!
text: Ira Sloan emerges from Tony’s apartment holding a capped beer by the neck. He walks
text: slowly down the hall, Mitch’s noise covering his approach.
text: Mitch unsnaps a holster on his belt.
dialog: ... [know ya indeh, c’mon.
text: He withdraws the gun.
dialog: ... C’mon, open iss dawn will talk, ya fuckin creep ya—
dialog: Hrugh!
text: Ira Sloan has clubbed him from behind.
text: He clubs him down the door, Mitch grunting under each blow. Ira Sloan bends down to
text: pick up Mitch’s gun. A hissing noise.
text: Ira Sloan straightens, screaming. Mitch, slumped on his back, is macing him.
text: Ira Sloan steps back, still screaming. He wraps his left elbow around his face and extends
text: his right hand with the gun. He fires blindly.
text: Bang. Bang. One bullet thunks the door. One hits Mitch in the chest. The third clanks
text: and starts an airshriek: it has hit the mace.
text: The pressurized cannister hits the ground and spins shrieking. Mace sprays everywhere.
text: Ira Sloan yells on, firing. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bullets plug the wall, Mitch’s body,
text: Mitch’s face.
text: Ira Sloan stumbles away screaming. He blunders the length of the narrow hallway
text: caroming off the walls, face still wrapped into his elbow. He hits the front-door window
text: and it shatters. He uncovers his face—starting to swell—to grope for the knob.
text: He finds it and plunges out into the street, screaming, trailing broken glass.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: 109
text: He sits in a cheap formal parlor, on an uncomfortable-looking Louis XV chair that
text: doesn’t quite let his feet touch the ground. He is chewing a peanut butter sandwich; its
text: plate and a glass of milk sit on a side table next to him. We hear the TV, off, which he
text: watches. The window behind him gives a view of a suburbia more downscale than his
dialog: own.
text: A car is pulling up the drive though no sound carries through into the house. Gardner
text: emerges from the car and we do just barely hear its door slam. He trots toward the front
text: of the house, his gait suggesting that he is unused to running: stiff-legged, with one hand
text: pressed down against his suit coat to keep it from flapping back as he runs.
text: Nick continues to watch TV.
speaker_heading: GARDNER’S CAR
text: Gardner drives in a thin-lipped fury.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: How did you get to Mitch’s house? Who let you out?
text: Nick is huddled in the corner of the passenger front seat.
dialog: Nicky
dialog: Uncle Mitch brought me.
text: Gardner grimly shakes his head.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: I don’t even want to think about the two of you talking. . .
dialog: saying crazy, irresponsible thing. . . words have conse-

dialog: Silence.
dialog: ... Yes?
text: Again he shakes his head.
dialog: ... You are in deep, deep doo-doo.
text: He decides something.
dialog: ... You’re going with us. To Aruba. You can’t be left to
dialog: yourself.
dialog: 110
text: He nods to himself.
dialog: ... Margaret will understand.
dialog: Nicky
text: She’s dead.
text: Gardner looks at him, not alarmed, merely uncomprehending:
dialog: Gardner
dialog: . .. What?
dialog: Nicky
text: One of the men from Valley Forge came back. He kilt her.
text: Gardner stares at him.
dialog: Gardner
dialog: ... One of the. . . what?
text: He gives a strangled hiccough of surprise. He glances front, stares back at Nicky, then
text: emits a short, barking, humorless laugh.
dialog: Oh no. No, they wouldn’t do that... She’s waiting at
dialog: home. .. No...
text: He stares out at the street, his jaw working. He suddenly busts out sobbing. Through
dialog: tears:
dialog: ... Tl tell you one thing, son: I’m not going anywhere
dialog: without Maggie. Oh God! Oh God!
text: He bears down on the accelerator. The car is picking up speed.
text: Nicky speaks in a small voice:
dialog: Nicky
text: Everybody’s dead. God is dead.
dialog: Solemnly:
dialog: Gardner
dialog: Don’t ever say that, son.
dialog: 111
text: Up ahead, their house is just coming into view. Parked across the street from it is a green
text: Delta 88. Ira Sloan has just gotten out of the car and is heading across the street for the
text: house. At the whine of the approaching car he turns.
text: His face is grotesquely swollen, eyes puffed down to slits. He squints through tears at the
text: approaching car, mouth agape, breath rattling, snot flowing.
text: He digs for his—Mitch’s—gun, finds it, levels it at the car.
text: Gardner punches the accelerator.
text: Impact. From inside the car we see Ira Sloan’s body flip up over the hood, smack the
text: windshield directly in front of us, and flip back onto the roof.
text: Gardner blubbers.
text: Nicky shrinks. Over Gardner’s wails another sound: a thudding-bouncing on the roof of
dialog: the car.
text: The car exterior: Ira Sloan’s leg is caught on the roof luggage rack.
text: Back to the interior: the thudding of Ira Sloan’s body is painfully loud inside the car, like
text: being inside a drum. Nicky claps his hands to his ears. Gardner wails.
text: Ira Sloan’s head flops down directly in front of us and bounces against the windshield.
text: His face is ballooned. Blood streams across it.
text: Nicky screams.
text: Gardner blubbers.
text: His foot presses the accelerator to the floor.
text: Nicky screams.
text: Ira Sloan’s head, bouncing with the car, sends blood streaming down the windshield.
text: Wind feathers the blood back across the glass.
text: Nicky screams, looks from the windshield to Gardner.
text: The car is speeding out of control.
text: Gardner’s hands are clenched on the steering wheel. Nicky’s small hands try to pry them
dialog: loose.
dialog: 112
text: Gardner’s foot vibrates against the accelerator. Nicky’s legs kick at it.
text: The car hits a bump; there is the sound of rolling on the roof. Nicky turns to look out the
dialog: back window:
text: Ira Sloan’s body rolls onto the trunk and then off onto the street and bounces away,
text: growing small fast as the car speeds along.
text: Nicky looks back to Gardner who moans, gasping for air.
text: Gardner clutches at his chest with one hand. His face is turning a deep shade of purple.
text: He is displaying the classic symptoms of myo-cardial infarction.
text: Nicky pries at Gardner’s hands which rigidly grasp the wheel. Suddenly they grow limp;
text: his head slumps down against the wheel, staring, glassy-eyed.
text: Nicky screams. The car gives a tremendous jolt and he looks front.
text: The car has jumped the curb in front of a white colonial house and is speeding up its
text: manicured lawn, churning sod.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR HOUSE
text: At impact. The car groans to a halt, half-inside, half-outside the house. Dust from
text: splintered wood and pulverized wallboard eddies through the air. The engine loudly

text: We pan the team as they listen to the coach—a voice we haven’t heard before:
dialog: Voice
dialog: All right, men, excellent game today, excellent. You
dialog: displayed good attitude, good sportsmanship, good mental
dialog: alertness. . .
text: The pan reveals uniformed Nicky, a little bruised but not much worse for wear, standing

dialog: All right then. . . 1 wonder what Mom’s whipped up for
dialog: dinner. . .
text: They are pulling up the driveway of Nicky’s new home: a white Colonial with a
