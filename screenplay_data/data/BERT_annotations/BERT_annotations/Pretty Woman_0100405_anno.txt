scene_heading: EXT. A HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
text: The view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous, ornate house
text: is extraordinary. A small outdoor dinner party is in progress.
text: A MAGICIAN is entertaining guests. Playing cards and coins
text: appear and disappear in his nimble hands.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT
text: EDWARD HARRIS stands at the window, impassively looking down
text: at the party. Edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around
text: forty. He looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured
text: by a night's sleep.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (a murmur)
dialog: Left pocket.
text: And indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the
text: left pocket of the incredulous WOMAN's silk blazer. More
text: laughter and applause.
text: The study is in keeping with the rest of the house. Luxurious.
dialog: Everything the best. WILLIAM STUCKEY, Edward's contemporary,
text: is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host. VANCE is an
dialog: investment banker. His assistant JAKE, is a financial
text: researcher. The other men are INVESTMENT BANKERS. They are
text: in dark suits and power ties. On the table are stacks of
text: documents and folders, the name "KROSS INDUSTRIES" is prominent
dialog: on many of the folders.
speaker_heading: INVESTMENT BANKER 1
dialog: Our banks certainly doesn't want
dialog: to discourage Harris Enterprises
dialog: from investing in California.
dialog: We think this is a great new venue
dialog: for you but you've got to
dialog: understand the mergers and
dialog: acquisitions market is changing.
dialog: With the upswing in inflation we
dialog: have to make these offerings
dialog: tempting to offset the risk.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Look, we're talking about hard
dialog: assets and a straight liquidation.
dialog: We have over a thousand man hours
dialog: in this deal.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (losing patience)
dialog: This is a "no brainer". There's
dialog: no risk for you. No one has ever
dialog: lost money backing Mr. Harris.
speaker_heading: INVESTMENT BANKER 2
dialog: Not yet. But ship building is
dialog: a new endeavor for you...
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (cuts him off)
dialog: Come on. You know we're not
dialog: going to go into ship building.
dialog: Besides, you're the ones with the
dialog: troubled track record, not us!
speaker_heading: INVESTMENT BANKER 3
dialog: Bill, be reasonable. If you're
dialog: really going to digest Kross
dialog: Industries that quickly eighteen
dialog: should not be such a problem.
dialog: Besides, I don't think there's
dialog: anywhere else you can go for the
dialog: money in the time you have.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It's unacceptable.
text: Edward turns from the window. He hasn't miss a thing. All
text: eyes are on him.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Draymen Heux has offered me
text: seventy-five in the pool at
dialog: sixteen and a half. I can secure
dialog: the other half personally. You
dialog: have until tomorrow morning to
dialog: make me a better offer.
text: The bankers speechlessly stare at him.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: The meeting is over, gentlemen.
text: He turns away. The bankers look at one another. They rise.
text: Silence as they exit. When the door closes. Stuckey explodes
dialog: with laughter.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Hah! Did you see the look on
dialog: their faces?
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: You don't think we pushed too
dialog: hard?
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: NO way! They'll come back. They
dialog: can't afford not to. Edward,
dialog: that bluff was beautiful.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Maybe I should have made it
dialog: rhyme.
text: The others stare at him, uncertain. Stuckey laughs. The
text: others follow suit.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (looking at his watch)
dialog: Well! It's late. We've been
dialog: at this long enough.
text: Stuckey rises. Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Gentlemen, enjoy the party. The
dialog: magician's wonderful.
text: Vance and Jake exit.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (calling after them)
dialog: Watch your left pocket.
text: A BUTLER has entered the room.
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: Phone call, Mr. Harris. It's Miss
dialog: Charles.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Cynthia? Is she coming out?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: We're about to find out. Go on.
dialog: Take care of your guests.
text: Stuckey exits the room as Edward crosses to the telephone.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Where are you, Cynthia?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I see.
dialog: (pausing, getting angry)
dialog: No, I don't expect you to be at
dialog: my beck-and-call. Are you coming
dialog: or not?
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT
text: Edward descends the long, curved stairway. He has Vance in
dialog: tow.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (all business)
dialog: Prepare the filing papers. Have
dialog: them ready by the middle of the
dialog: week. I'll tell you when to
dialog: submit them.
text: The PEOPLE talking and drinking on the stairway gravitate
dialog: toward Edward.
speaker_heading: A MAN
dialog: Edward!
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (turning on the charm)
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: Will we see you at the polo
dialog: matches Wednesday?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Wouldn't miss it.
dialog: (abruptly; to Vance)
dialog: I want this done fast and easy.
dialog: No slip-ups. I want to be back
dialog: in New York by Saturday. Got it?
text: He deftly keeps making his way through the crowd.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
text: Stuckey is sipping champagne and talking to a beautiful
text: WOMAN in a tight sheath of an evening dress. An elegant woman
text: ELIZABETH STUCKEY approaches from behind him. She taps him on
text: the shoulder and he turns, startled.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Bill?
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Oh... Hi, honey... Millicent,
dialog: uh, uh, Millicent.
speaker_heading: MILLICENT
dialog: Lowell.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Lowell, right. My wife,
dialog: Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: Is Edward leaving?
text: Stuckey looks up to see Edward moving quickly toward the door.
text: Stuckey abruptly leaves the two woman together to follow Edward.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Edward comes out of the house. Jags, a limo with waiting
text: DRIVER and two BMW's pack the circular driveway behind a black
text: Ferrari. The limo driver leaps to attention at the sight of
text: Edward. Edward stands, making an obvious effort to keep his
text: impatience under control. Stuckey comes out of the house and
dialog: down the walk.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: What's up, where you going?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Give me your car keys, will you,
dialog: I'm going back to my hotel.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: At least stay for a drink. This
dialog: party's for you.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
text: Stuckey gropes uncertainly in his pocket for keys.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Listen, there're some major local
dialog: talent inside just dying to meet
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (as if delighted)
dialog: Really? Some high class gold
dialog: digger who speaks French better
dialog: than I do?
dialog: (turning away)
dialog: No, thank you. I just got off
dialog: the phone with one.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Cynthia's not coming?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No.
text: Edward grabs the keys out of Stuckey's hand. He crosses to a
text: black Ferrari and gets in.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Let your driver take you. We'll
dialog: move the cars...
text: Edward starts the car.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Can you drive a stick?
text: The car lurches forward with a squeal of wheels and promptly
dialog: stalls.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Edward, give me a break!
text: With a squeal of tires, the Ferrari bucks out of the driveway
dialog: and... stalls again.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Love this car! Is it new?
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Yes! And you don't even know
dialog: where you're going!
text: Edward starts it again and heads uncertainly uphill. Stuckey
text: watching, throws up his hands.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: That's the wrong way!
text: CREDITS BEGIN AS IN A SERIES OF CROSSCUTS:
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
text: The Ferrari, moving fast through the Hollywood Hills, passes
text: large, beautiful homes... Edward shifts, grinding gears...
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
text: The Ferrari comes to a red light and pulls up next to a Dodge Colt.
text: The GIRL in the Colt looks at Edward and his car admiringly.
text: Edward feeling confident now, revs the engine. The light turns
text: green. Edward immediately stalls the Ferrari. The Colt leaves
text: him in the dust.
scene_heading: INT. FERRARI - NIGHT
text: Edward drives. He blinks, shakes his head as if trying to rid
dialog: himself of his own tired thoughts.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
text: The Ferrari comes to the intersection of OUTPOST and FRANKLIN,
text: stops. Edward gets out of the car. He looks at the street
text: signs. He has no idea where he is. He signs. He gets back
text: in the car and takes off on Franklin heading East.
scene_heading: EXT. A SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT
text: A crumbling old apartment building. Dark alley ways, deserted
dialog: parking lot.
dialog: The Ferrari -- blink and you miss it -- motors past the building,
text: looking very out of place on the street.
text: PANNING UP A building facade of lit windows and metal fire
text: escape. One window in particular. A GIRL stands there in a
text: short kimono, looking down. And then she turns away.
scene_heading: INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A SERIES OF SHOTS to see her dressing.
scene_heading: INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: VIVIAN turns and stares at herself in a grainy, cracked bedroom
text: mirror. She is twenty years old and a prostitute. Make-up
text: applied to give her a hard, older look doesn't quite succeed.
text: She'd be innocently beautiful without it. She is wearing tiny
text: shorts, a tight tube top, thigh high boots. She stares at
text: herself, not really liking what she sees. A moment. She signs,
text: turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Faded, peeling walls. Thread bare, dirty carpet. Vivian locks
text: the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway.
text: A door suddenly opens, startling her. An unshaved, enormously
text: pot bellied MAN in a stained t-shirt stares at Vivian with pig
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: Vivian.
text: Vivian turns some "tough" on him.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah, what?
speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: Rent. You're late.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Don't give me that. Kit gave it
dialog: to you yesterday, cash.
speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: Kit give me nothin'.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (suddenly uncertain)
dialog: You bullshittin' me?
speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: Of rent I do not bullshit.
text: Vivian hurries at a run back down the hallway.
speaker_heading: LANDLORD
dialog: By the end of the week or you're
dialog: otta here.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: By the way, you look very nice
dialog: tonight!
scene_heading: INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN
text: Vivian pulls a coffee can off a shelf. She pulls off the top.
text: It's empty. She tosses the can away, starts for the door. She
dialog: opens it.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Down the hallway, the landlord is standing in front of his open
text: doorway, talking to a FAT WOMAN. They both glance up.
text: Vivian quickly closes the door. She doesn't want to deal with
dialog: them.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Vivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk. She hurried
dialog: away.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT
text: Vivian walks along, urgently looking for something... someone.
text: A BABBLING STREET-TYPE goes by happily talking to himself.
text: He wears an "I Love Hollywood" t-shirt.
text: Vivian passes TOURISTS but doesn't notice them any more than
text: she pays attention to the VAGRANT she passes further on, huddle
text: in a doorway.
text: A LONG-HAIRED KID on a SKATEBOARD goes by dropping off little
text: bags to various STREET-TYPES.
text: A BARKER-TYPE stands in front of a photo store urging tourists
text: to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut-out of a movie
dialog: star. Some go in.
text: Vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking JAPANESE TOURISTS.
text: A BLACK PROSTITUTE in a mini skirt strolls toward her. A car
text: passes. The DRIVER stares at Vivian with interest. She ignores
text: him. The black prostitute approaches the car.
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?
text: The Driver looks her over. The Black Prostitute gets in the
text: car and it drives away.
text: A GROUP OF MEN, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night
text: coffee shop. They WHISTLE and make obscene gestures and SOUNDS
text: as Vivian hurries by. She ignores them and goes next door into
text: a falafel stand. Half a dozen PEOPLE sit at dirty tables inside.
scene_heading: INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT
text: Behind the counter are a MAN and a WOMAN, Vietnamese cooks
text: frying food, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the
dialog: shop.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Chan, you seen Kit tonight?
speaker_heading: COOK 1
dialog: Hi, hi! No see nothing.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You do, tell her I'm looking for
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: COOK 2
dialog: Looking good, bay-bee.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah, you too, D'Nai. If Kit
dialog: comes in here, tell her stay.
text: Both of them nod and smile at Vivian. Vivian exits.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT
text: Skateboard zips by a GROUP. We SEE a police car parked at the
text: entrance to an alcove. Also, an ambulance. The bubblegum
text: lights are going. A CROWD has gathered. The happy man with
text: the "I Love Hollywood" t-shirt and a POLICE OFFICER are engaged
text: in tense conversation.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: They just pulled her out of a
dialog: dumpster in the back. Now talk
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I tell you, man, I don't know who
dialog: she hang with.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: She have a pimp?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Cocaine her pimp, man. She a
dialog: strawberry. She be out on these
dialog: streets, day in, day out, tradin'
dialog: her sorry ass for crack. And
dialog: now she dead from it.
text: Vivian rushes up to join the outskirts of the crowd as the body
text: of a YOUNG GIRL is pulled out of an open dumpster and carried
text: towards the waiting ambulance. For a moment Vivian thinks
text: it's... no, Vivian turns grimly away.
text: Vivian surveys the dark street. And suddenly sees who's she's
dialog: looking for. Walks.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - WIG SHOP - NIGHT
text: We SEE a young, tough-looking MAN and WOMAN trying on wigs.
text: The STOREKEEPER is a man wearing a dress and wild wig. The
text: girl, KIT, is around 18, is dark haired and thin. The young
text: man, CARLOS, has his arm sloppily draped across Kit's shoulder.
text: They giggle about something, both obviously high. Kit looks
text: up, bleary-eyed. She stops. Vivian is standing in front of
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Hi, Viv. Carlos, you know my
dialog: roommate, Viv.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Lookin' good, baby.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: Did you blow it all, Kit? Is it
dialog: all gone?
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Carlos had some great rock.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I bet.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That was our rent!
text: Carlos attempts to put an arm around Vivian's shoulders.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Calm down, Chica.
text: Vivian throws him off.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Ey! What is it you wan', baby?
dialog: I can fix you up.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Beat it, scum bucket!
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: You kiss your mother with that
dialog: mouth? Your frien' still owes
dialog: me 200.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (to Kit)
dialog: Let's go.
text: Skateboard appears suddenly, blocking Vivian and Kit's path.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Get out of my face or I'll have
dialog: those cops on your ass in two
dialog: seconds.
text: Carlos glares at her. He looks down toward the lights of the
text: cop cars. One of the POLICEMEN looks towards them, curiously.
text: Vivian waves at the cop.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: (threatening to Vivian)
dialog: Don't take no dates tonight,
dialog: chica, you got one with me.
text: Vivian grabs Kit by the arm and pulls her across the Boulevard.
scene_heading: INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT
text: Vivian and Kit sit at a table sipping tea. Vivian is still
dialog: mad at her.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: We worked for that money. We
dialog: were gonna put together enough
dialog: to get out of that dump we live
dialog: in, get off this street.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Viv... don't be stupid. We're
dialog: whores.
text: Vivian looks like she wants to weep. Or scream. She does
text: neither. She slowly nods. Kit's sorry she said that.
speaker_heading: KIT (cont'd)
dialog: So I blew our stash. We could
dialog: make it all back with one good
dialog: night on the streets.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I just saw somebody pulled out
dialog: of a dumpster. I wonder how much
dialog: she made tonight?
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Don't be mad at me. I'll pay
dialog: you back. I promise.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I thought you were giving up that
dialog: drug shit.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: I will. I'm trying.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Meanwhile I got some crack left,
dialog: you wanna get high?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: No, let's go to work. Okay?
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (then touches her hand)
dialog: I'm sorry I said your dream was
dialog: stupid.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT
text: Edward's Ferrari turns onto Hollywood Blvd., finally out of
dialog: the Hollywood Hills.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT
text: Vivian and Kit are out trying to hustle John's in passing cars.
text: Vivian strikes a sexy pose at the bus stop. Kit is talking to
text: another prostitute, RACHEL.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: No no, honey. You see these
dialog: stars on the sidewalk. Me and
dialog: Vivian work from Don Ameche all
dialog: the way up to Roy Rogers.
dialog: This is our office. We got
dialog: seniority. Get off our corner.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I was just taking a rest here.
dialog: Besides, she's new.
dialog: (points to Vivian)
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: But I'm old. Go rest up by Monty
dialog: Hall or Debra Paget where you
dialog: belong.
text: Rachel walks off.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (looks at passing cars)
dialog: Looks slow tonight.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Maybe we should get a pimp.
dialog: Carlos likes you and --
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Forget it. We work for it. We
dialog: keep it.
dialog: They keep hustling.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: I can't handle this tonight.
dialog: I'm going home.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (stares at her)
dialog: That crack is burning a hole in
dialog: your pocket. There isn't even
text: milk in the fridge. The rent's
dialog: due. Now come on --
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - ANGLE ON FERRARI - NIGHT
speaker_heading: KIT (O.S.)
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - BACK TO SCENE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: He's not gonna want us.
text: The Ferrari goes by and stops.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (calls out to Vivian)
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Don't take less than a hundred.
dialog: You look hot tonight. And
dialog: remember, don't mouth off. They
dialog: don't like that.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Okay. Go home. But take it easy
dialog: on that shit.
text: Kit gives Vivian a quick hug.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: You're the greatest. I'll wait
dialog: up for you.
text: And then Kit is off, moving quickly away. Vivian turns. She
text: stares at the Ferrari, loathing it and all it represents. And
text: then it's as if Vivian turns a switch. She fluffs her mane of
text: hair, throws her shoulders back, thrusting her breasts out and
text: sashays towards the car, a sexy, friendly smile on her face.
text: In the driver's seat of the Ferrari, Edward is looking furious
text: and distracted. Vivian leans over the passenger window.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You looking' for some company?
speaker_heading: EDWARD

dialog: You gonna tell me you're lost?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Great. What do I look like a
dialog: tourguide?
text: Edward takes a good look at her.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: No, you look like a hooker.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Actually, I'm a movie star out
dialog: for a walk.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Good. Can you tell me how to
dialog: get to Beverly Hills?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Sure. For five bucks.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: That's ridiculous.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: The price just went up to ten.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Why don't you just do it out of
dialog: the kindness of your heart?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: Sit... and spin.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Sit-and-spin.
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Alright... why not?
text: He pulls out his money clip.
text: Vivian suddenly freezes. On the sidewalk up ahead, Carlos and
text: Skateboard. Carlos flashes an evil, menacing grin. He motions
text: to Skateboard, they start forward.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (holding up a bill)
dialog: You have change for a twenty.
text: Vivian pulls open the door of the car and jumps in.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: For twenty, Ill show you
dialog: personal. Drive.
text: Edward stares at her. She smiles sweetly.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Make a "U-ee". Beverly Hills
dialog: is the other way.
text: The Ferrari pulls away, passing Carlos on the sidewalk.
scene_heading: INT. FERRARI - MOVING - NIGHT
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Nice car. Yours?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (as he grinds the
dialog: gears; wincing)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Stolen?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Not exactly.
text: He smiles. Vivian smiles back.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Mind if I turn on some heat?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: If you can figure it out, be my
dialog: guest.
text: Vivian reaches out, turns on the heat.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Very good. You're obviously
dialog: mechanical.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You're not from L.A., huh?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: New York.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What motel you staying at?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Hotel.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Okay, what hotel?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet
dialog: you know it.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (annoyed at his tone)
dialog: Yeah, I peed in the fountain there
dialog: once. Give me a break.
text: Edward glances over, amused. It hits him that she really is
dialog: an attractive girl.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What do you want it to be?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Vivian, my name's Vivian.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You like being a hooker, Vivian?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: It pays.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: So do day jobs.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Day jobs, yeah. I've tried them.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Turn right.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MONICA BLVD. - NIGHT
text: The Ferrari glides along a seedy, West Hollywood section of
dialog: Santa Monica.
scene_heading: INT. FERRARI - MOVING - NIGHT
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Must be dangerous. Hooking.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Tell me about it. L.A. is
dialog: suffering from a wacko epidemic.
dialog: And who knows where half the guys
dialog: I pick up have been. I mean, I
dialog: use condoms. Always. And I get
dialog: checked out once a month at the
dialog: free clinic. Not only am I better
dialog: in the sack than an amateur, I'm
dialog: probably safer.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Very good. You ought to have
dialog: that printed up on your business
dialog: card.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: If you're making fun of me, I
dialog: don't like it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Sorry. If I did, I didn't mean
dialog: to.
text: Vivian unconsciously bites her fingernails.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Ugly habit, biting your nails.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You don't know habits, you think
dialog: this is ugly.
text: But she puts her hands in her lap. She looks out the window.
text: She's safe from Carlos.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Okay, pull over. Let me out.
dialog: I've got to get back to work.
text: Edward pulls the Ferrari to the curb and stops.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Stay on this street and you'll
dialog: hit Beverly Hills.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What do you charge for company,
dialog: Vivian?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Company would cost you... a
dialog: hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: For the whole night?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: For an hour.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I never joke about money.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Neither do I.
dialog: (a moment; amused)
dialog: A hundred bucks an hour though.
dialog: That's pretty stiff.
text: She reaches across the seat. Her hand goes in his lap.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: No, but it's getting there.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian, how much to put up with
dialog: me for the entire night?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You couldn't afford it.
text: Vivian starts to get out of the car.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Try me.
text: A moment. Vivian's sexy smile comes on.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Three hundred.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What's your name, lover.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Edward. My name is Edward.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Edward... you got it!
text: Edward gets out of the car. Vivian looks at him confused.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Get in. This side.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You know how to drive a stick?
text: Vivian moves around the car.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Better believe it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Then let's go. It's worth 300
dialog: just so I don't have to drive.
text: They get in the car.
scene_heading: INT. FERRARI - NIGHT
text: She starts the car, revs it.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Here we go Edward.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT
text: The Ferrari peels out, fishtails madly and SCREAMS up the
dialog: street.
scene_heading: EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Thousands of tiny white lights sparkle along the walls of the
text: Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Bright flags are illuminated
text: by carefully placed spotlights. The Ferrari SCREAMS into the
text: driveway and comes to a jarring stop by the front door.
scene_heading: INT. FERRARI - NIGHT
text: Edward takes a moment to get his breath. He gestures toward
dialog: the back.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: My raincoat's in the back. Put
dialog: it on.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You may feel more comfortable.
dialog: This is not the kind of place that
dialog: rents rooms by the hour.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You mean they don't have hookers.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Every place has hookers, but if
dialog: this hotel has hookers, they don't
dialog: look like they're...
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
text: Off the boulevard.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Exactly.
scene_heading: INT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
text: As they walk in, Vivian is tying the trenchcoat.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Great. Now I took like a hooker
text: in a trenchcoat.
text: She looks up. She stops in her tracks. The lobby is bright
text: and spacious, filled with thick carved wood paneling. Even at
dialog: this hour there is a great deal of activity. MEN in business
text: suits and WOMEN in furs and jewels are passing by. Vivian's
text: face quickly conceals the sudden awe she feels at the sight of
text: all this luxury. Vivian matter of factly reaches out and takes
dialog: Edward's arm.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: So let's go.
text: Edward guides them across the lobby. They reach the elevators
dialog: and go inside.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: The young ELEVATOR OPERATOR is dressed in a clean red uniform
text: that seems just a bit too tight. As the elevator doors close
text: he nods toward Edward.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: Evening, sir.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Good evening. Penthouse.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Penthouse. My, my.
text: She sees the operator glancing at her.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: The penthouse. And step on it.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Edward and Vivian come out of the elevator into a hallway
text: leading to a single doorway with two heavy wood doors. Edward
text: pulls out his key and unlocks the doors. With a gentle push
text: the door slide open in unison. Edward gestures to Vivian to
text: go inside. She does. Edward closes the doors behind her.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: As Vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling
text: off the top of the building. In front of her is a sunken living
text: room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the
text: city below. For the first time, she is speechless. Edward
text: closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living
text: room. Edward picks up a phone. Vivian checks out the room.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Room service.
dialog: (to Vivian)
dialog: What do you drink?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Diet coke.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Send up a bottle of Crystal
dialog: champagne.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Can I have some chips?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (into the phone)
text: -- and a bowl of strawberries.
dialog: Thank you.
text: Vivian makes her way down the steps to the living room. She
text: stares at the view.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (to Vivian)
dialog: Impressed?
text: Vivian is impressed but she's not going to admit it.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You kidding? I come here all the
dialog: time. As a matter of fact they
dialog: do rent this room by the hour.
text: Edward smiles. He sits down in a comfortable chair and leans
text: back. Vivian looks at him.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Well, now that you have me for
dialog: the night, what are you going to
dialog: do with me?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Want to know something? I don't
dialog: quite know. I hadn't planned
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Do you plan everything?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (a small smile)
dialog: Always.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Well, the meter's running, it's
dialog: your money. Speaking of which,
dialog: cash'll do. In advance.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Fair enough.
text: He rises. Takes out his wallet. Standing over her, he drops
text: THREE crisp, new hundred dollar bills in Vivian's lap. She
text: picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed.
text: She puts the money in her jacket. She realizes Edward is
text: standing over her as if waiting.
text: She leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants. He abruptly
text: turns away.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Let's talk some more first.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Right.
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: So! In town on business?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (taking off his jacket)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (loosening his tie)
dialog: And why do you say that?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (a small smile)
dialog: I dunno... you have that sharp,
dialog: useless look.
text: Edward almost smiles. He sits across from her again.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Sounds like you've known a lot
dialog: of lawyers.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I've known a lot of everybody.
text: A chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the door.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Champagne.
text: He starts to sit up. Vivian motions for him to stay put.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Hey. I might as well make myself
dialog: useful.
text: Edward sits back down. Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens
text: the front door. A WAITER comes into the room with a silver
text: cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Where would you like it?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Where would we like it?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Where would we like it? Here'll
dialog: be fine.
text: The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle
text: of the living room. He turns and heads back up the stairs and
text: pauses near Vivian, staring. Vivian stares back at him.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What are you looking at?
text: The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits. Vivian closes
text: the door behind him. Vivian marches back down the stairs.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I think he wanted you to tip him.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Tsk. Excuse me, I didn't think
dialog: he had change for a hundred.
text: Edward crosses to the silver stand. Vivian watches with
text: interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: You have a wife? Girlfriend?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I have both.
text: Edward lifts the bottle out. He deftly pops the cork on the
text: bottle without losing a drop of champagne.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Where are they? Shopping
dialog: together?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: They should be. They're both good
dialog: at it.
text: Edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and
dialog: hands one to Vivian.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (cont'd)
dialog: My ex-wife lives in London in what
dialog: used to be my home.
dialog: My girlfriend is in New York
dialog: moving out of my apartment even
dialog: as we speak. Cheers.
text: He drinks, nods approvingly.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It's a very good year.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Oooh, thank god.
text: Edward laughs softly. She sips it. To her surprise, really
text: likes it. Edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen
text: enormous strawberries.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Try a strawberry.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Because they bring out the flavor
dialog: of the champagne.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Jesus, you act like you're
dialog: seducing some Valley girl you
text: picked up in a dance club.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian... the meter's running...
dialog: cooperate.
text: A moment. She slowly eats a strawberry. The juice of it stains
text: her lips. Her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip
text: of champagne, licks away the stain of the strawberry. His eyes
dialog: haven't left her.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (softly)
dialog: You really are a very beautiful
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (husky-voiced)
dialog: Just a romantic, that's you.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes...
text: Her mouth is so wet and inviting... he leans closer...
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Me too.
text: He's about to kiss her...
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Not on the lips.
text: He freezes. She pulls his head down to her breast.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Edward and Vivian on the bed. He is on his back, his shoulder
text: and head resting against the headboard. She is astride him,
text: hands resting on his chest, rocking... in control, confident...
text: very much liking the fire she's kindled in his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - CLOSE ANGLE ON THEIR FACES - NIGHT
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (touching her breasts)
dialog: What do you like?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: If I want you to turn me on I'll
dialog: pay you three hundred. Just lay
dialog: back and let me drive.
text: Smiling, Vivian reaches behind her, touching him. He tries not
text: to groan. She's moving faster now. Edward suddenly pulls her
text: violently to him, he rolls her over...
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - SHOWER - NIGHT
text: A heavy spray of water comes down upon Edward. He stands there
text: quietly letting it wash over him. He turns off the shower,
text: steps out of the stall, picks up a towel and dries himself.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Edward stares. His expensive clothes are on the floor,
text: haphazardly dropped everywhere. Vivian's clothes, as tattered
text: as they are, are neatly folded and piled on a chair. The
text: incongruity of it touches Edward in a sad way. He looks toward
text: the bed. Vivian is fast asleep. Her heavy makeup has long since
text: been rubbed off. Asleep, her wary, smart-ass attitude is gone.
text: She looks like a sweet, gentle girl. He stares at her a moment
text: longer. He turns, goes into the living room. Vivian opens her
text: eyes. Through the open door she sees Edward sitting in a living
text: room chair. He is reading contracts.
scene_heading: EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - MORNING
text: The sun is coming up as HOTEL EMPLOYEE hoses down the sidewalk
text: in front of the hotel.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - MORNING
text: A WOMAN EMPLOYEE is vacuuming the lobby. She sees something
text: and pauses. She pulls a dead leaf from one of the potted
dialog: plants.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MORNING
text: The elevator doors open and A WAITER rolls a cart out into the
text: hallway. He takes it to the doors of the penthouse. He rings
dialog: the bell.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (O.S.)
dialog: It's open.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: The Waiter wheels in a table of food, coffee, champagne and
text: orange juice. Edward dressed in suit pants, white shirt and
text: suspenders, stands in the living room talking into a cordless
text: phone. Edward points the Waiter to the dining table.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Sorry. Go ahead.
scene_heading: INT. STUCKEY'S HOUSE - MORNING - INTERCUT
text: William Stuckey is behind his desk.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Kross knows we're after his
dialog: company. He wants to talk with
dialog: you. I don't think you should.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: The Waiter returns. Edward signs the bill. The Waiter exits.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I want to.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Edward, if the three of us sit
dialog: down together we might as well
dialog: announce our plans in the Wall
dialog: Street Journal.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'll see him alone. Everyone
dialog: knows you're my muscle. We'll
dialog: make it social. Tell Kross I'll
dialog: meet him for dinner. Tonight if
dialog: you can arrange it.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: You shouldn't go alone. He might
dialog: claim that you tried to black mail
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Bill, we're businessmen, not the
dialog: damn mafia. I'll see you in the
dialog: office. By the way, about your
dialog: car...
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Oh, god, what?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I'll bring it back.
text: Edward hangs up. He pours a glass of orange juice and takes
text: a sip, thinking. Something makes him turn. Vivian, wearing
text: a monogrammed hotel terry robe, is standing uncertainly in the
dialog: bedroom doorway.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You didn't wake me. I'll be out
dialog: of here in a minute.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No hurry. Would you like some
dialog: breakfast?
text: She's hungry and the breakfast looks great.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Only if you do.
text: Edward sits. Waits. Vivian sits across from him. Edward
dialog: serves them breakfast.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Did you sleep well?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah. Too good. I forgot where
dialog: I was.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Occupational hazard?
text: She looks at him sharply, sees that he means no offense,
dialog: relaxes.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Where'd you go?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I took the couch. I had some work
dialog: to do.
dialog: (hesitating)
dialog: About last night...
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Oooh, Baby, you were the best.
dialog: I was beside myself.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Mmm, I could tell.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I just hope it was worth three
dialog: hundred bucks.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'd say you give a good dollar
dialog: value.
text: They share a small smile. They eat.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Do you ever... enjoy it?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I like guys if that's what you're
dialog: asking. Not that I trust'm.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No? Why's that?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: "Occupational hazard".
text: A moment. Edward chuckles. Vivian grins.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: what do you do anyway?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I buy companies.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: No shit. They expensive?
text: He almost smiles. She almost smiles back.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: The one I'm buying this week will
dialog: cost around 150 million.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: ... dollars?
text: He nods. This time Vivian is impressed.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: You are major league, baby. Your
dialog: mother must be very proud.
text: Edward is oddly pleased at her reaction.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY
text: The closet door is open. Edward reaches for a tie. In the
text: closet are about a dozen expensive looking suits, shirts, shoes,
text: etc. She follows him in.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: So what a ya do with the companies
dialog: once you buy'm?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (fumbling with the tie)
dialog: I sell them.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What? Why?
text: She undoes his knot and starts over.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: At ease, let me do that. Part
dialog: of the all night services.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: By breaking up a company's assets
dialog: --
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What are assets?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian --
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: C'mon, I might buy a company some
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Assets are anything of value a
dialog: company owns. Sometimes the
dialog: pieces are worth more than the
dialog: whole. By selling them off, I
dialog: make a profit.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Sorta like stealing cars and
dialog: selling'm for parts, huh?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Not... quite.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: There, see? Now the emblem is
text: right in the middle of the knot.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Where'd you learn to do this?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: I fucked the debate team in high
dialog: school. Tsk. I had a grampa.
dialog: He liked ties on Sundays. You
dialog: mind if I take a swim in your
dialog: bathtub before I hit it?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Don't drown.
text: Vivian turns and heads toward the bathroom. He follows her
dialog: into the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY
text: Vivian turns on the water in the tub. It fills the tub in a
dialog: torrential rush.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You could hold a pep rally in
dialog: here!
text: The phone on the marbled bathroom wall suddenly rings. Edward
dialog: reaches for it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: INT. STUCKEY'S HOUSE - INTERCUT
text: Stuckey is walking around his desk.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Edward, it's me. Kross is all
dialog: set for tonight.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY
text: Vivian stares curiously at the bidet.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Listen, I gotta say this again,
dialog: I don't like you going alone.
text: She turns it on. The water hits her in the face.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (stifling a chuckle)
dialog: I'm a big boy.
text: There are lotions and shampoos and bubblebaths on the edge of
text: the tub. Vivian regards them like a kid in a candy shop.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Let me at least get you a date.
dialog: Keep it social.
text: Edward watches as Vivian smells some bubble bath. She smiles.
text: Her eyes ask Edward if it's okay to...? He nods.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Edward, did you hear me?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'm here.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: I know a lot of nice girls.
text: Vivian pours the bubblebath into the swirling water. There's
dialog: something about the look on her face... the way she bites her
dialog: lower lip... curious, sensual...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I have one.
text: Edward hangs up the phone as Vivian curiously turns on the
text: television. The sound blares. She fumbles to turn it down.
text: Edward reaches over and turns it off.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: All right. How much for the week?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'm in town until Saturday.
text: She look at him like he isn't speaking English.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Do-you-want-to-stay-here-
dialog: for-the-week?
text: It takes Vivian a moment to respond.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: It'd cost you.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Of course. How much?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Five full nights... days too?
text: Edward nods. Vivian hesitates... it's got to be enough to
text: really change things... She shoots for the moon again.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Four thousand.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian, may I point out five more
dialog: nights at three hundred a night
dialog: is only 1,500.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: But you want days too.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: All right, two thousand.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Three.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Holy shit.
text: And then, quickly getting herself back together, she flips on
dialog: the sexy smile.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Sugar, you got it. I will treat
dialog: you like a prince. Anything,
dialog: anyway you want.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'm not just talking about sex.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Look butthead, I'll treat you so
dialog: nice you'll never want to let me
dialog: go, okay?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Three thousand for five days.
dialog: And Vivian, I will let you go.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Edward comes out into the bedroom. Vivian quickly follows.
text: They move through the bedroom into the living room.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'll be out most of the day.
text: He reaches into his pocket for a money clip. He peels off
text: bills. He hands the cash to Vivian.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I want you to go out and buy some
dialog: decent clothes.
text: Vivian's eyes go wide at the amount of money.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Nothing too flashy, not too sexy.
dialog: Conservative. Understand?
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE ENTRANCE WAY - DAY
text: They're at the front door.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah, you want me to dress like
dialog: your high class girlfriend.
dialog: You're wasting your money though.
dialog: All I'm gonna do is hang around
dialog: the hotel. As a matter of fact,
dialog: I may never get out of that
dialog: bathtub.
text: Edward opens the door, he starts to exit. He turns back.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Think again. I'm taking you out
dialog: to an important dinner with me
dialog: tonight.
text: The door closes in her face.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE THE PENTHOUSE DOOR - DAY
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (O.S.)
dialog: (from inside)
dialog: What? Are you crazy?
text: Edward smiles to himself.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Probably.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY
text: Vivian is stretched out in the hot bubble bath. The TV is on.
text: She clicks the remote control in her hand.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Three thousand...
text: She lies back into the soapy water and disappears. She suddenly
text: pops back up, laughing.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Three thousand!
text: A thought occurs to her. She reaches for the cordless phone.
text: She dials. She waits. She is about to disconnect when the
text: phone is answered.
speaker_heading: KIT (O.S.)
dialog: 'Lo.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Kit! Where've you been?
speaker_heading: KIT (O.S.)
dialog: I was asleep. You woke me. You
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Kit, listen, the guy last night,
dialog: the one in the Ferrari, I'm at
dialog: this hotel, the Regent Beverly
dialog: Wilshire, it's this absolutely
dialog: unbelievable place and he's hired
dialog: me for a whole week and Kit,
dialog: listen, he's paying me three
dialog: thousand bucks! We can get out
dialog: of the apartment. We can get out
dialog: of this town. We can do anything!
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Kit? Hey, you there?
speaker_heading: KIT (O.S.)
dialog: Why'd he want you?
dialog: That hurts. Perhaps because Vivian's been wondering the same
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: He... he just does.
speaker_heading: KIT (O.S.)
dialog: I'm sorry, Viv'. Carlos has been
dialog: on my back.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Did you get the money up front
dialog: like I taught ya'?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Three hundred for last night and
dialog: he gave me extra to buy some
dialog: clothes. Now listen, I'm gonna
dialog: leave an envelope for you at the
dialog: front desk.
dialog: Give me two hundred to the scum
dialog: bucket and the other hundred to
dialog: that asshole landlord for part
dialog: of the rent. Spend it on drugs
dialog: and I'll pull your hair out.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: I'm getting dressed now. I'll
dialog: be over. Bye.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Hey Kit, where do I go for the
dialog: clothes? Good stuff on him.
speaker_heading: KIT (O.S.)
dialog: (brightening)
dialog: In Beverly Hills?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KIT (O.S.)
dialog: Baby! Rodeo Drive.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: Vivian comes out of the elevator and crosses the lobby. She
text: is back in her hooker clothes. She leaves an envelope at the
dialog: front desk.
text: MR. THOMAS, the prim, middle-aged hotel manager, steps out from
text: his office. He stares in surprise and displeasure as he sees
text: Vivian exit out the front door. Vivian doesn't notice the odd
text: stares she gets from two well-dressed MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN who are
text: just entering.
scene_heading: EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
text: Vivian is looking wide-eyed and delighted and yes, more than
text: a bit overwhelmed. She passes store windows... and MORE STORE
text: WINDOWS... and still MORE STORE WINDOWS. Each display is more
dialog: beautiful and expensive than the one before.
text: Vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks. From
text: PASSERBY'S. Two beautiful dressed GIRLS her own age look at
text: her, turn away and giggle. The uniformed GUARDS that stand at
text: attention in front of many of the stores, stare at her
dialog: suspiciously.
text: Feeling more and more uncomfortable, Vivian comes to a posh
text: woman's boutique. She hesitates for a moment. She enters.
scene_heading: INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY
text: Vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the
text: disapproving stare of a SALESWOMAN standing behind the counter.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: (cooly)
dialog: May I help you?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I'm just looking, thanks.
text: Vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with
text: delicate glass objects. She cautiously examines a dress. The
text: Saleswoman quickly comes around the counter and approaches her.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: Are you looking for something in
dialog: particular?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yes. Something... conservative.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: Yes...
text: Vivian eyes the Saleswoman, puzzled at her tone. She examines
dialog: a dress.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You have beautiful things.
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: How much is this?
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: I don't think it would fit you.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (beginning to get the
dialog: drift)
dialog: I didn't ask if it would fit.
dialog: I asked how much it was.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: It's very expensive.
text: Vivian's body tenses as she stares at the Saleswoman.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What is with you?
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: (unblinking)
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I'm going to spend money.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: I don't think we have anything
dialog: for you here. You're obviously
dialog: in the wrong place.
text: Vivian is speechless. She turns and stomps toward the door.
text: She stops and spins around staring at the Saleswoman. Vivian
text: flips her off. She throws the door open and storms outside.
text: The Saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns
dialog: to her place.
scene_heading: EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
text: Vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost. She takes
text: a deep breath, trying to control herself. Two WOMEN, in elegant
text: designer outfits, stroll by, eyeing Vivian as if she were a
text: freak. Vivian suddenly feels naked. She turns and hurries
dialog: away.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: Vivian enters the lobby, upset, nervous and paranoid. She feels
text: an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury
text: around her. She hurries toward the elevators.
text: At the front desk, Mr. Thomas, once again spots her. He crosses
text: the lobby and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: May I help you Miss?
text: Vivian stops, practically shaking with terror.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I'm just going to my room.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: You're a guest here?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I'm -- I'm with a friend.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: And who is that?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I... Edward...
text: Vivian's face is filled with confusion. She doesn't know his
text: name. The elevator doors open behind them. She spots the
dialog: Operator.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (blurting it out)
dialog: He knows me.
text: Mr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously. The Operator
text: looks back at them innocently. With a smooth gesture Mr. Thomas
dialog: waves the Operator over.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Do you know this young lady?
dialog: The Operator nods.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: She's with Mr. Harris.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Mr. Harris?
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: She apparently joined him last
dialog: night.
text: Mr. Thomas waves the Operator away.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Why don't you come with me. We'll
dialog: chat for just a moment.
text: He takes Vivian gently but firmly by the arm and leads her off.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY
text: In a richly furnished office, Mr. Thomas places Vivian in a
text: comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Vivian.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Miss Vivian... things that go
dialog: on in other hotels don't happen
dialog: at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
dialog: Vivian says nothing.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
dialog: Mr. Harris, however, is a very
dialog: special customer. And we like
dialog: to think of our special customers
dialog: as friends. As a customer, we
dialog: would expect Mr. Harris to sign
dialog: in any additional guests. But
dialog: as a friend, we're willing to
dialog: overlook it, I'm assuming you're
dialog: a... relative?
text: Vivian finds herself nodding.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
dialog: I thought so. You must be his...?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Niece?
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Of course. Naturally when Mr.
dialog: Harris leaves, I won't see you
dialog: in this hotel again.
text: Vivian bites her lower lip, nods.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
dialog: Good. We understand one another.
dialog: (as a gentle
dialog: afterthought:)
dialog: I would also encourage you to
dialog: dress in a more appropriate
dialog: manner.
text: Vivian's face screws up as she tries hard not to cry.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: That's what I was trying to do.
text: She can't help it, the tears come. Vivian pulls out the money
text: Edward gave her. She drops it on the desk. It's a moist-
text: looking wad now.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: I was trying to get some other
dialog: clothes... but...
dialog: they wouldn't... they made me feel
dialog: like shit...
text: She can't go on. Mr. Thomas politely glances at the money.
text: He unfolds it, smoothes it and hands it back to her. He sighs.
text: He picks up the phone. He dials.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Women's clothing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Bridget, please.
text: Vivian is staring at him.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
dialog: Bridget, hello, this is Barnard
dialog: Thomas over at the Regent Beverly
dialog: Wilshire. Well, thank you, that's
dialog: flattering. I'd like to ask a
dialog: favor of you. I'm going to send
text: someone over. Her name is Vivian.
dialog: She's a guest of ours. A very
dialog: special guest.
text: He glances at Vivian. With those simple words, he'd made her
dialog: feel better.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
dialog: She's from out of town and she
dialog: needs a little help in dressing.
dialog: Perhaps you could help her out.
dialog: Thank you very much. She'll be
dialog: right over.
text: He sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at Vivian.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
dialog: There you are. If you have any
dialog: other problems, come ask for me
dialog: personally. I'm Mr. Thomas.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Barney.
text: She smiles mischievously.
scene_heading: EXT. FORT OF LOS ANGELES - DAY
text: A sleek corporate helicopter flies over the port.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAY
text: Edward, Vance, Stuckey and Jake walk toward the building's
text: edge. They look out over the empty shipyard as Vance describes
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Okay... this is the jewel in
dialog: Kross's crown. We can strip out
dialog: all the heavy equipment. Some
dialog: of the cranes are very valuable
dialog: overseas. The Japanese are
text: salivating for them.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Prime industrial property
dialog: straddling the Port of Long Beach
dialog: and Los Angeles. It gives me a
dialog: hard-on.
text: Edward points toward one of the edges of the shipyard.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What's that long building over
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Storage, I think.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Not with those smokestacks it's
dialog: not.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Let me check.
text: Vance pulls out a notebook.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: The real estate possibilities
dialog: are endless. Most of the yard
dialog: we'll just level. I talked to
dialog: a couple of developers, under the
dialog: table, of course, and they said
dialog: --
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You what?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I talked to some developers about
dialog: the land.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: What kind of an idiot are you?
dialog: You don't talk about this to
dialog: anyone.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: They're close friends, they'd
dialog: never breathe a word --
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (to Vance)
dialog: Where did you dig this moron up?
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: He's right, Jake, that was an
dialog: incredibly stupid thing to do.
dialog: It won't happen again, Edward.
dialog: I'll pull him off the project
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Don't bother.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: We don't have the time to bring
dialog: someone new up to speed.
dialog: Besides...
dialog: (not unkindly, to Jake)
dialog: You've already impressed everyone
dialog: you need to, haven't you?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It won't happen again, Mr. Harris.
text: Vance has found what he was looking for in his notebook.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: This is interesting. That
dialog: building is storage now, but it
dialog: used to be a smelting plant. They
dialog: closed it down after World War
dialog: II.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I want our lawyers to check into
dialog: the toxic waste licences on them
dialog: right away. I want to know if the
dialog: permits are still valid and what
dialog: kind of limits are on them.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Jesus, yes. It's a long shot but
dialog: if the permits are still in
dialog: effect, they're worth a fortune.
text: He turns away. The other follow Edward back toward the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What time's diner tonight?
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
text: Eight o'clock. Kross is bringing
dialog: his son. Very bright kid, watch
dialog: yourself with him. Who's this
dialog: girl you're taking?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No one you know.
scene_heading: INT. SAKS - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
text: The elevator opens and Vivian walks out and surveys the room
text: nervously. She walks toward the women's clothing section.
text: BRIDGET, a large friendly woman, spots her and quickly
dialog: approaches.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: You must be Vivian.
dialog: Vivian nods.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET (cont'd)
dialog: Let's look at you...
text: She steps back, regards Vivian with a professional eye.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET (cont'd)
dialog: Where are you from, dear?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Georgia.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: No wonder. For starts, you should
dialog: know that hot pants are horrid,
dialog: even when you do have the legs
dialog: to carry them off. What are your
dialog: plans while you're in town?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Well... I might be going out to
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: You'll want a cocktail dress
dialog: then. Turn. You have a beautiful
dialog: figure. A little too out in the
dialog: open but simply lovely. Size six?
dialog: Do you need shoes?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I dunno. Do thigh high, leather
dialog: boots go with a cocktail dress?
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Philip! We'll need shoes!
text: Bridget leads Vivian towards the racks of clothes. She pulls
text: out a dress.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Your uncle will like this.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: He's not really my uncle.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: They never are, dear.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Mr. Thomas is behind the desk. He looks up. Vivian is standing
text: there, a happy look on her face. She holds up a garment bag.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I got a dress.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: I rather hoped you'd be wearing
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I didn't want to get it messed.
dialog: I got shoes too. Wanna see?
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: That's all right. I'm sure
dialog: they're quite lovely.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: They were real nice to me there.
dialog: They treated me, y'know... nice.
dialog: Thanks, Barney.
text: Mr. Thomas tries not to wince at the familiarity.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: You're very welcome, Miss Vivian.
text: She smiles at him. He watches as Vivian turns and walks toward
text: the elevator. The provocative way her hips move just naturally
text: attracts the attention of a MALE PASSERBY. And the white gloved
text: ELEVATOR MAN literally leaps to press the elevator button for
text: Vivian who rewards him with a happy smile. Mr. Thomas sighs.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The phone is ringing Vivian enters. She hurries to pick it up.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Hello?
text: The phone keeps ringing -- it has more than one line. Vivian
text: frantically punches buttons.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Hello? What? Hello?
scene_heading: INT. STUCKEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON - INTERCUT
text: Edward is in a private office.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Never answer the phone. Ever.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Tsk, believe me, this will be the
dialog: last time.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Did you buy some clothes?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I got a dress, yeah.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Just one? Christ... I hope it's
dialog: appropriate.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: It's very tasteful. I think
dialog: you'll especially like the zipper
text: in the crotch.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: I'm -- joking.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Let's hope so. You'll get some
dialog: more clothes tomorrow. I'll be
dialog: pushed for time so meet me in the
dialog: hotel lobby at seven forty-five
dialog: sharp. Got it?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: No, I don't "got it". Even the
dialog: farmboys back in Georgia come to
dialog: the door when they're taking you
dialog: on a date.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: This isn't a date.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Go by yourself then. Where you
dialog: taking me anyway?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: The Rex.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Any good?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I think you'll approve.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: ... all right. I'll meet you in
dialog: the lobby. But only cause you're
dialog: paying me to.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Thank you very much.
text: Vivian slowly sets the phone down. The phone rings again.
text: Vivian, very carefully, punches the flashing button and picks
dialog: it up.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I thought I told you not to answer
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Oooh!
text: Edward hangs up. He smiles to himself.
text: Vivian bites her fingernails, looking nervous. The doorbell
text: RINGS. Vivian looks up, startled. She rises, moves to answer
dialog: it.
text: It's the Spanish MAID. She nods politely at Vivian.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Housekeeping. I come to turn
dialog: down the bed. 5:00, I turn down
dialog: the bed.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What?
text: The Maid points to her hotel badge, trying to explain.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Housekeeping. I come to turn
dialog: down the bed.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Okay.
text: The Maid enters.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Is there a trick to it?
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The Maid turns down the bedspread.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Is that all? You just fold back
dialog: the bedspread?
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: I also place las chocolates on
dialog: the pillow.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Oooh, I love those.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: I leave extras, miss.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Thanks! Consuelo, are all rich
dialog: people so lazy they can't do this
dialog: on their own?
dialog: Consuelo shrugs.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Mr. Thomas is still behind the desk, working when a soft voice
text: startles him.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Barney.
text: He looks up. He sighs. Vivian still hasn't changed.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: What is it, Miss Vivian?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Edward is taking me to some fancy
dialog: place for dinner. The Rex. Ever
dialog: been there?
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: It's a bit beyond my... range,
dialog: shall we say.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah, mine too. Is it like,
dialog: y'know, normal?
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: I think you'll find it normal
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Will I like it?
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: You'll like it fine.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Okay. Thanks, Barney. You're
dialog: the best.
text: She turns away.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Just mind which fork you use.
text: Vivian turns abruptly back, a horrified look on her face.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Fork?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
scene_heading: CLOSE ANGLE - PLACESETTING
text: An elegant formal placesetting complete with a myriad of
text: different size forks, spoons, stacked china plates and crystal
dialog: glassware.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MR. THOMAS AND VIVIAN
text: sit across from one another at a fully set table.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: In fifteen minutes I can teach
dialog: you everything you need to know
dialog: to dine with the Queen. First,
dialog: as you pick up the knife you shift
dialog: your fork to the left hand.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: But I always eat like this.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Either you're European or badly
dialog: brought up.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Hmmm... I vonder vich.
dialog: (giggles)
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Actually, some of the richest
dialog: people I know have the worst
dialog: manners. Of course, Mr. Harris,
dialog: being of old money, knows his way
text: around a table. All right now,
dialog: pay attention please. Salad fork.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What if they serve soup?
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: They will serve salad.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: But what if they serve soup?
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Then you use your soup spoon.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I like steak.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: (picking up the
dialog: appropriate utensil)
dialog: Then you would use your--
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Steak spoon!
dialog: (laughs)
text: Mr. Thomas swallows his exasperation.
text: WE PULL BACK from their table to reveal the cavernous, empty
text: banquets room, each table is set and ready for the dinner
dialog: service.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Miss Vivian --
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Maybe I'll just order a burger,
dialog: Barney, that way I can eat with
dialog: my hands.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Miss Vivian... there's a salon
dialog: here in the hotel. Instead of
dialog: worrying unnecessarily about table
dialog: manners, why don't you just have
dialog: your hair done instead?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Professionally?
scene_heading: INT. SALON - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Vivian sits in a salon chair. The last customer, THANE, a
text: young man of about twenty with his long hair pulled back in a
text: pony tail, tilts her head one way and then another, eyeing her
dialog: professionally.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I have a friend who has a friend
dialog: who does Cher's wigs.
speaker_heading: THANE
dialog: I hate him already.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: All set?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah... what a ya say we chop
dialog: it all off and bleach the tips.
speaker_heading: THANE
dialog: Darling? Trust me.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING
text: Edward enters and looks around the lobby. No Vivian. Annoyed.
text: Edward crosses to a house phone and picks it up. He's about
dialog: to dial when:
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Good evening, Mr. Harris.
text: Edward looks at him blankly.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Barnard Thomas, manager of the
dialog: hotel.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Of course, yes. If you'll excuse
dialog: me just a moment --
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: I have a message for you from your
dialog: "niece", sir.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: My what?
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: The young lady staying in your
dialog: room?
text: Edward's eyes narrow. He hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I think we both know she's not
dialog: my niece.
text: Mr. Thomas looks uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (cont'd)
dialog: Does this hotel have any problem
dialog: with that?
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is
dialog: a guest of ours and shall be
dialog: treated accordingly. The young
dialog: lady asked me to tell you that
dialog: she is waiting for you in the
dialog: lounge.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Thank you.
text: He starts towards the lounge.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Very intriguing young woman, Miss
dialog: Vivian.
text: His tone stops Edward in his tracks.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
dialog: Have a good evening, sir.
text: And off he goes, leaving Edward to wonder what the hell
dialog: transpired during the afternoon.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: Edward enters the lounge. He looks around, not seeing Vivian.
text: And suddenly his eyes go back to... the beautiful girl with the
text: beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress
text: at the piano bar. Edward tries to hide his surprise as Vivian
text: rises, moves elegantly towards him. She smiles.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You're late.
dialog: Such a beautiful woman deserves an apology and so, without
dialog: thinking:
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You're forgiven.
text: She waits expectantly. He holds out an arm. She takes it.
scene_heading: INT. REX RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Vivian comes out of the ladies room. She walks forward past
text: the MAITRE'D'S station. She stops. She takes a breath... and
text: then walks forward.
scene_heading: INT. REX - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN
text: Vivian moves down a marble starircase, through the elegant
text: restaurant toward a far table. Her beauty and natural grace
text: draw approving stares. She is like a queen moving through a
dialog: ballroom.
text: At a secluded table, Edward sits in conversation with two men.
text: JAMES KROSS, in his early 70's, a bulky self-made millionaire
text: industrialist. Sitting next to him is his son and second in
text: command, DAVID KROSS, a handsome man in his early thirties.
text: All of them rise as Vivian comes to the table. David Kross
text: holds out Vivian's chair for her. Surprised, she nods her
text: thanks. In front of her is an enormous placesetting. She
text: smiles down at the utensils, filled with confidence.
text: Waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of
text: them. Vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork. But then she
text: sees that Kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and
text: is digging into his salad with that.
text: Vivian looks to see what Edward will do. He doesn't seem
text: interested in eating yet. Neither does David Kross. Feeling
text: a sudden panic, Vivian puts her fork down.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: So young man, I understand you
dialog: are trying to take over my
dialog: company.
text: A moment. The abruptness of the question takes Edward back for
text: a moment. But then he almost smiles.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Please don't patronize me, Mr.
dialog: Kross. Our ages mean nothing
dialog: here.
text: Kross and David look at each other.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mr. Harris, we know you've
dialog: purchased at least twenty percent
dialog: of our stock. We also know you
dialog: plan to file a formal bid for a
dialog: majority share.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Twenty-five percent.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: Mr. Harris, I built Kross
dialog: Enterprises myself. I know every
dialog: man who ever worked there by his
dialog: first name. I know their wives...
dialog: and their children. If your
dialog: intention is to take over my
dialog: company and turn it into a
dialog: glorified real estate deal, think
dialog: again.
text: Edward, thankfully, now reaches for his salad fork and begins
text: to eat. Relieved, Vivian picks up hers. They all eat for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What do you suggest, Mr. Kross?
text: WAITERS approach, some to clear the salad plates, some to put
text: down the next course. Vivian, thinking she's got to finish,
text: quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad. She is
text: reluctant to let the Waiter take her fork.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: What would it take to buy our
dialog: stock back? Name your price.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: To get me in a mood to sell --
dialog: double what I paid. But your
dialog: company doesn't have enough
dialog: capital right now to buy anything.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We're on the verge of closing
dialog: a large navy contract. Double
dialog: is ridiculous but we can assure
dialog: you a healthy profit on your
dialog: shares. We would give you a
dialog: promissory note...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You're not getting any navy
dialog: contracts.
text: Vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this
dialog: news.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There's no way you could know
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: But I do know. I also know your
text: lines of credit are over-extended.
dialog: If I don't buy your company,
dialog: someone else will...
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Ah, the escargot.
text: Escargot are put down in front of everyone. Vivian stares at
text: them dubiously. She picks up what she assumes is the next
text: "right" fork. She picks up a snail. The two do not fit.
text: Flustered, she doesn't know what to do. No one else seems to
text: be eating. And now a Waiter comes and places escargot forks
text: at each place. Vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (softly, to the Waiter)
dialog: Scume me, what are these things?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (bending to whisper)
dialog: Escargot, mademoiselle.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (leaning close to
dialog: whisper)
dialog: Snails.
text: Vivian stares at them, horrified. She, like James and David
text: Kross, no longer seem interested in eating. Edward eats with
dialog: pleasure.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell
dialog: you my stock. On the contrary,
dialog: I'm here to buy yours.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: (angry)
dialog: You've got a lot of nerve.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No. What I have is a lot of
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: I know all about you, Mr. Harris.
dialog: When you buy companies, they have
dialog: a way of disappearing. Even the
dialog: pension funds are stripped clean.
dialog: The last three companies you took
dialog: over were cut up in so many
dialog: pieces, widows were left without
dialog: their retirement checks.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: What I did with those companies
dialog: was perfectly legal.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: I don't question the legality
dialog: of what you do. It's your
dialog: morality that makes me sick. I
dialog: will not allow my company to be
dialog: raped by a man like you.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (angry now)
dialog: It is not your company. It's a
dialog: public company. And I am going
dialog: to acquire it. Either I buy from
dialog: the other stock holders, or I buy
dialog: from you.
text: Vivian struggles with her escargot.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (cont'd)
dialog: I would suggest that you and your
dialog: board cooperate with me, rather
dialog: than fight a battle you don't have
dialog: the ammunition to win.
text: Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table. Everyone
text: looks to her.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Slippery little suckers...
text: Kross rises.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: If you'll excuse me young lady,
dialog: Mr. Harris...
dialog: (turns to David)
dialog: Deal with this, David, you know
dialog: where we stand. I need to go
dialog: someplace and puke.
text: He rises. He exits.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Edward and Vivian)
dialog: Men like my father built this
dialog: country. He was no saint. He
dialog: screwed people. But for every
dialog: guy he stepped on, he gave a
dialog: hundred a good job.
text: Edward is silent.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: He seems like a nice man.
text: David looks at Vivian as if seeing her for the first time.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: We can reach an understanding on
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't think so. You should
dialog: know we're going to fight you with
dialog: every resource we have.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Do what you have to do. I don't
dialog: take it personally.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I do. I take it all very
dialog: personally.
dialog: (to Vivian)
dialog: Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
text: David Kross gets up and leaves. Vivian and Edward sit in
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: And that's the way the game is
dialog: played.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Some game. Screwin' some poor
text: slob out of his retirement.
text: Edward says nothing. But Vivian can see she's hit a nerve.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Snails for dinner. No wonder
dialog: everybody is in such a bad mood.
text: A Waiter appears at the table.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Are we ready for the next course,
dialog: sir?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No. Bring a check, please.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Edward's face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of
text: the glass window down at the city lights. He quickly drains
text: his champagne glass. Vivian moves to stand next to him.
text: She refills his glass from the bottle.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Thank you.
text: He drinks. Silence.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You're upset, huh?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Upset. No. I never get upset
dialog: about business.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You liked the guy, though.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Whether I liked him or not is
dialog: irrelevant. It's business.
dialog: There's no emotion involved in
dialog: business... if you want to
dialog: survive.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (excited)
dialog: We're the exactly the same! Kit
dialog: keeps telling me don't get
dialog: emotional when you turn tricks
dialog: -- that's why no kissing -- it's
dialog: too personal.
dialog: The key is like you're saying,
dialog: stay numb, don't get involved --
dialog: when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot,
dialog: I just do it.
dialog: (realizing what she's
dialog: saying and quickly
dialog: recovers)
dialog: Except with you. At your price
dialog: I give my all...
dialog: Edward laughs.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Let's not talks about this heavy
dialog: stuff. Come on, relax.
text: Vivian comes up behind him. She begins to rub his shoulders.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: That... is very good.
text: A moment. Edward is silent. Turns him, unknots his tie,
text: unbuttons his collar.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Know what we're gonna do in a
dialog: little while then? We're gonna
dialog: call Domino's and have'm deliver
dialog: a bigass pizza. We're gonna eat
dialog: it in bed. We're gonna veg' out
dialog: and watch television.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Television?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah, it's this box, it has
dialog: pictures, sound. You don't have
dialog: to use your brain at all.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I have work to do.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Uh-uh. No work.
text: Smiling, she softly kisses his throat.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: See... what you haven't figured
dialog: out yet...
text: She kissed his neck. She fumbles with his belt.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: Is that while you're the boss
dialog: everyplace else... I'm the one
dialog: in charge here.
text: She kisses his chest.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (cont'd)
dialog: You... just think you are.
text: She starts to kneel down. He stops her. They stare at one
text: another for a moment. He releases her. She smiles. She
text: starts to undress him.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Vivian is asleep. She turns over, slowly waking. Her hand
text: goes out to touch Edward and encounters nothing but empty bed.
text: Vivian comes awake with a sudden start. She look around
text: momentarily frightened, not sure where she is. Sighing with
text: relief, she lies back down. She sees Edward's American Express
text: card on the pillow next to her.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (O.S.)
dialog: Wake up, Vivian. Time to shop.
text: Edward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed.
text: He is tying his tie. Vivian sits up and ties it for him. He
text: smiles at her.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I still don't understand why you
dialog: only bought one dress.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I wasn't as much fun as I
dialog: thought it was going to be.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Well, you know those cold bitches
dialog: that work in those stores and try
dialog: to intimidate you? It works.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Was someone rude to you?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I had a little problem in one
dialog: store. I wasn't dressed right.
dialog: I don't know what to say. I don't
dialog: belong there. Maybe I'll just
dialog: go back to Bridget. She was cool.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian, you belong wherever you
dialog: are. I don't care how you were
dialog: dressed, they were the ones who
dialog: were wrong, not you.
text: Edward sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (cont'd)
dialog: People aren't going to respect
dialog: you unless you respect yourself.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: The next time someone is rude to
dialog: you, you stare at them right here.
text: He softly touches her, right between the eyes.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (cont'd)
dialog: It's an old trick I use,
dialog: especially with bankers. Works
dialog: every time. Will you try it?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (confidently)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Come with me?
text: Edward looks at his watch. Vivian covers it with her hand.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Please.
scene_heading: INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY
text: A beautiful, chic women's shop. The haughty SALESGIRL
text: approaches Vivian near a rack of dresses. Edward hovers in the
dialog: b.g.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Hello. Can you help me?
text: The Salesgirl looks Vivian up and down. A Pause. Vivian gives
text: her "the stare" and straightens up. We see the Salesgirl's
dialog: reaction change.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (confidently)
dialog: I'm looking for a dress, nothing
dialog: too flashy, not too sexy,
text: conservative. In a size six.
speaker_heading: SALESGIRL
dialog: (uncomfortable under
dialog: Vivian's stare)
dialog: Do... do you have a charge
dialog: account with us?
text: Vivian smiles and draws out Edward's American Express card.
text: The Salesgirl nods and quickly moves to a rack of dresses to
dialog: find Vivian's size.
scene_heading: INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY - IN A SERIES OF CUTS
dialog: Vivian tries on different clothes under Edward and the
dialog: Salesgirl's supervision.
text: Vivian comes happily out of the dressing room wearing a low
text: cut, spangled and fringed outfit. Edward shakes his hand. The
text: Salesgirl holds a classic tweed ensemble over Vivian's outfit.
text: Vivian scowls.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: I look like fucking Nancy Reagan.
scene_heading: INT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The Salesgirl shows Edward clothes by Ann Taylor. He turns

speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Kross came out of his corner
dialog: swinging. He started buying up
dialog: all available stock as soon as
dialog: the market opened.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: He's a tough old son of a
dialog: bitch...
text: Edward is watching Vivian. She pulls the hem of her skirt up
text: to mid thigh. She looks hopefully over to Edward. Edward
text: shakes his head.
speaker_heading: VANCE
text: It's up to ten and a quarter.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Offer nine and a half. Bring
dialog: them back down to earth.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Goddamit! Where is he getting
dialog: the money to fight?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Someone's loaning it to him.
dialog: Get on it right away.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Our contract guys are working
dialog: on the Kross pension funds.
dialog: There's another forty million
dialog: there. We can bleed'm dry.
text: There is a sudden hesitation in Edward's eyes. He watches as
text: Vivian tries on a hat. She preens for him. He smiles.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (to Vance &amp; Stuckey)
dialog: Put the pension funds on hold
dialog: until I say otherwise.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: We're letting them slide?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I want the treatment plant
dialog: licenses to be top priority right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: But, Edward...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Do it.
text: Edward hangs up and takes a long look at Vivian. She moves
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (looks at his watch)
dialog: You're on your own now, Vivian.
dialog: I've got to get to work. Be
dialog: sensible and you can keep
dialog: everything. Spend too much and
dialog: it all goes back.
text: Vivian hugs him again.
scene_heading: EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
text: Vivian walks along Rodeo Drive. She looks lovely in the pink
text: dress and new, white shoes. A pretty, white hat is the final
text: touch. She carries a bag containing her old clothes. She stops
text: at a trashcan and ceremonially throws the offending items away.
scene_heading: INT. TORIE STEELE BOUTIQUE - SHOPPING MONTAGE
dialog: We SEES Vivian in each department within the store with
text: different SALESPEOPLE. She happily and confidently tries on
text: a variety of dresses, hats, shoes, accesarries, etc.
text: 1) Vivian is in a dressing stall. She tosses a dress out
text: to a waiting SALESWOMAN.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Not me!
text: 2) A SALESWOMAN holds a long, purple evening gown.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (imitating Bridget)
dialog: Horrid!
text: 3) Vivian is admiring a pair of beautiful suede dress pumps.
text: Her attention is drawn to the SALESMEN'S exotic hand-painted
dialog: tie.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Where'd you get your tie?
text: 4) Vivian stands in front of an enormous tie rack with the
text: Salesman, a dozen wild, swirling designed ties are hanging over
text: his outstretched arm. Vivian picks out the brightest one and
dialog: smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
text: Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags. She
text: feels like she owns the block. A well-dressed MAN passes by,
text: smiling politely. Vivian's nose lifts as she happily ignores
dialog: him.
text: Suddenly Vivian stops. She's about to pass the shop she was
text: thrown out of. Vivian takes a breath and enters the shop.
scene_heading: INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY
text: Vivian enters. The moment she steps through the door, Vivian's
text: courage leaves her.
text: The saleswoman is waiting on a CUSTOMER.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: (to the customer)
dialog: Isn't this lovely? I think it
dialog: would look wonderful on you.
text: Vivian musters her courage. She takes a deep breath and starts
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: (to her customer)
dialog: Would you like to try it on?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: 'Scume me.
text: Both the saleswoman and her customer look up. The saleswoman
text: smiles pleasantly.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Do you remember me?
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: No, I'm sorry, I don't.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I was in here yesterday.
text: Vivian slowly raises her middle finger. The recognition starts
text: to dawn in the saleswoman's eyes. Vivian's courage begins to
dialog: return.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah. That's right. It's me.
dialog: I want you to know something.
dialog: You made me feel terrible. I
dialog: wasn't dressed right and you said
dialog: I didn't belong here. Well, I
dialog: do. You're the one that was
dialog: wrong, not me. And I want to tell
dialog: you something else. I'm never
dialog: gonna shop here again as long as
dialog: I live.
text: And with that, Vivian turns and walks out.
text: The saleswoman is stunned. A beat. The customer thrusts the
text: dress into the saleswoman's arm as if offended by Vivian's
text: speech and leaves the store also.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: Mr. Thomas looks up from the desk. And stares. Vivian and a
text: BELLHOP stroll through the hotel entrance and across the hotel
text: lobby to the elevator. The bellhop's arms are packed with boxes
text: and shopping bags. Mr. Thomas can't help it. He smiles to
dialog: himself.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Vivian opens the front door for the Bellhop who carries in her
text: packages. She motions for him to place them on the couch. He
text: does. Vivian happily tips him with a five dollar bill. He
text: exits. The door closes.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Wheee!!!
text: Vivian does a giddy spin and falls onto the couch.
scene_heading: INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE MEETING ROOM - DAY
text: Stuckey enters. Edward is standing at the end of a long
text: meeting table. He is serving himself coffee from a tray.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (gloating)
dialog: You were right. Kross mortgaged
dialog: everything he has down to his
dialog: grandson's college tuition to
dialog: secure loans from a bank. Not
dialog: just any bank. One we do business
dialog: with.
text: Edward just sips his coffee.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY (cont'd)
dialog: It goes without saying that your
dialog: business means a great deal more
dialog: to them than our friend Kross's.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: All you have to do is make a call.
text: Edward is silent. Stuckey is again surprised.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Excuse me for saying this but what
dialog: is wrong with you this week?
dialog: First, you go soft on the pension
dialog: funds. Now, you're giving him
dialog: the chance to get away? As of
dialog: two minutes ago, you are committed
dialog: to the tune of over fifty million
dialog: dollars --
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Come on, Bill, don't talk to me
dialog: about how much money's involved.
dialog: It's my money.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: And some of it's mine. Edward,
text: his jugular's exposed.
dialog: Edward hesitates. Then:
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Get the bank on the phone for me.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - EVENING
text: Edward enters. He closes the door. He turns. And stops. A
text: beautiful, candlelit, food laden table has been set up in the
text: middle of the room. Champagne and wine chills in a bucket.
text: A fire burns in the fireplace. Music is playing.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (O.S.)
dialog: Hi.
text: Edward turns. And stares again. Vivian stands in the bedroom
text: doorway. She is wearing an exquisite silk dressing gown. She
text: looks incredibly beautiful.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Thank you. I would.
dialog: (he fingers her dressing
dialog: gown)
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Wait till you see what I have
dialog: on underneath.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Please.
text: She opens the dressing gown. What she has on underneath is
text: absolutely nothing. Edward crosses to her. Taking her in his
text: arms, he lifts her up and kisses her breasts.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What about dinner?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Dinner can wait.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: The bathroom is lit by candles. Vivian and Edward are in the
text: marble tub. Vivian sits behind Edward. She lazily washes his
text: shoulders and back with a large sponge.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You always been rich?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Seems like it. I guess it's easy
dialog: to get used to, huh?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Easier than learning how to be
dialog: poor.
dialog: (a moment; and then:)
dialog: My father's family was wealthy.
dialog: When I was young there were cars
dialog: and houses, private schools,
dialog: nannies. But then my father
dialog: divorced my mother to marry
dialog: another woman. And he took his
dialog: money with him.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Keep talkin'. I like hearin'.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Not much to tell. I went to
dialog: public school. Went to
dialog: university on scholarship. Went
dialog: to work for an investment firm.
dialog: In eight years I owned it.
dialog: (and then; growing very
dialog: quiet)
dialog: My father was chairman of the
dialog: board of the third company I ever
dialog: went after. I swallowed that
dialog: company and shit out the pieces.
dialog: One of the pieces was him.
text: Vivian softly traces small patterns on Edward's shoulders with
dialog: a finger.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You still mad at'm?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: He died a long time ago.
text: She gently rests her head on his back.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: PANNING BELLIES People are sunbathing by the pool.

text: wearing a miniscule bikini and sunglasses.
speaker_heading: WAITER (O.S.)
dialog: Miss Vivian?
text: She looks up. A young WAITER, looking a little dry-mouthed at
text: the sight of her, is holding a telephone.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: You have a call. Mr. Harris.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (taking the phone)
dialog: Hi, baby.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: I'll be ready. Bye.

speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What do you wear to polo?
scene_heading: EXT. THE LOS ANGELES EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Horses and riders crash and careen on the playing field. An
text: enthusiastic crowd cheers.
text: DOWN OFF THE EDGE OF THE FIELD
text: a tailgate party using Cadillacs and Rolls Royces is in
text: progress. Horses and riders thunder by a crowd of very
dialog: well-dressed, successful-looking people -- celebrities, execs,
text: socialites, aficionados -- most of whom ignore the game. They
dialog: are there to see and be seen much more than to watch a polo
dialog: match.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATER AFTERNOON
text: Vivian and Edward make their way towards the party. Edward is
text: wearing his new tie. Vivian is looking very chic and beautiful
dialog: in one of her new outfits. Not that it's helping -- the place,
dialog: the people, the wealth -- everything here suddenly has her
text: overwhelmed. She suddenly stops.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You're really pushing it,
dialog: bringing me here.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I think it's exciting.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What id we run into someone I

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I really doubt anyone here
dialog: frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You did.
text: A VOICE calls out.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY (O.S.)
dialog: Edward!
text: They turn. William Stuckey is with a group of people. He waves
dialog: them over.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY (cont'd)
dialog: Come on! Over here!
text: Edward takes Vivian's arm and leads her forward.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Stuckey grins and shakes Edward's hand.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (looking at Vivian)
dialog: Well, well, well...
text: Vivian dislikes this guy on sight. Dislikes the frosty looking
text: woman at his side.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (holding out a hand;
dialog: smiling)
dialog: Bill Stuckey, Vivian. My wife,
dialog: Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Hi.
text: Elizabeth Stuckey stretches her thin lips in a cold smile.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Lots of fun people here. Let me
dialog: get you two some champagne.
text: He moves quickly away.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH STUCKEY
dialog: Excuse me.
text: She moves to greet someone else. Vivian and Edward survey the
dialog: milling CROWD.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Real genuine guy.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: He's good at what he does.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You could freeze ice on his wife's
dialog: ass. She anything like your ex?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (a small smile)
dialog: Shall we mingle?
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ON THE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A goal is scored.
text: IN A SERIES OF CUTS
text: Edward watches and guides her, Vivian sips champagne and meets

scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A group of PEOPLE.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I simply love your dress, Vivian.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: This old thing?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Of course, a figure like yours
dialog: can wear anything. You must work
dialog: out constantly.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I lead a very physical life.
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN
dialog: Are you into running, Vivian?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I'm into walking. I walk a lot.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: In another group of PEOPLE.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER MAN
dialog: You look awfully familiar, Vivian.
dialog: Haven't we run into one another
dialog: at the spa in La Costa?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Well, I do often spa there.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Edward and Elizabeth Stuckey watch Vivian laugh and chat with
text: a group of WOMEN.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH STUCKEY
dialog: Edward, she's marvelous. Warm
dialog: and witty and down to earth.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (with pleasure)
dialog: She is, isn't she.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH STUCKEY
dialog: So unlike your usuals. Where on
dialog: earth did you find her?
text: Edward smiles enigmatically. Taking an hors d'oeuvres off a
text: passing WAITERS's tray, he starts forward.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: A WOMAN
dialog: We're good together. He has to
dialog: admit it. I've been just what
dialog: he wants me to be. I say the
dialog: right things, I know the right
dialog: people, I give wonderful parties.
dialog: No question, no arguments, no
dialog: embarrassments. It works for both
dialog: of us.
text: That makes Vivian think. And then she smiles as she sees Edward
text: approaching. Vivian moves to him.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Edward, these women here, I don't
dialog: think any of'm like the guys
dialog: they're with. They're just into
dialog: it for the money.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'm sure that's true for some of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I thought I was the pro. These
dialog: women make me feel like an
dialog: amateur.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Ready to stomp sod?
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ON THE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON
text: IN A SERIES OF SHOTS TO MUSIC
text: The CROWD engages in sod stomping. They drink champagne. They
text: make a dance out of it. They laugh. Shoes get stuck in the
dialog: mud. It's ludicrous -- these people in their suits and fancy
text: clothes, replacing divots and stepping over the horse shit.
text: In a corner of the field, grazing horses stare, seemingly in
dialog: disbelief.
text: Vivian is having a wonderful time. And then, as she moves
text: towards the outside of the crowd she sees someone staring at
text: her from over among some of the riders and grazing horses.
text: David Kross smiles at Vivian. She hesitates... and then she
text: crosses towards him.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: DAVID KROSS
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Hi. I never thought stomping

speaker_heading: DAVID

dialog: I like your hat.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Huh? Oh... yeah. S'okay?
dialog: (pleased; a moment)
dialog: Uhm... how're... business things
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let's not talk about it, it's too
dialog: depressing. Come on, I'll show
dialog: you Thunder.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Please, we hardly know each other.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thunder's a horse. Come on.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: They approach the sweating mount. David Kross caresses the

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey, big guy, you getting tired,
dialog: yet? I am. This is Vivian.
dialog: (a beat; and then:)
dialog: You two been together long? You
dialog: and Edward?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hope to be?
text: To Vivian's surprise, the question causes a pang inside.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: It's... it's not like that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I see. Well. Maybe that means
dialog: you'd have lunch with me sometime
dialog: then.
text: Vivian is suddenly silent. She looks away.
speaker_heading: DAVID (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sorry, am I being too forward?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You don't know anything about me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'd like to find out. You don't
dialog: know anything about me either.
dialog: That's why people have lunch.
text: But something holds Vivian back, a feeling.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - IN THE CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON
text: William Stuckey turns... stops... stares. He sees Vivian and
text: David Kross standing together. He stares, his mind racing, and
text: anxious, angry look on his face.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Stuckey has Edward off to the side. He is talking to him in
text: a low, earnest voice.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Fill me in on this. How'd you
dialog: and Vivian meet?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: We just did.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Come on, you can tell me. I sure
dialog: would like to know where a guy
text: runs into a girl as attractive
dialog: as this.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: The night I left your house, I
dialog: was lost. I was looking for
dialog: directions.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: And you just happened to run into
dialog: her. Great. What's she do? She
dialog: work?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Doing what?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian's in sales.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Sales, really? That's great.
dialog: What does she sell?
text: Edward's eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Why do you want to know?
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Hear me out. I've known you a
dialog: long time. I see a difference
dialog: in you this week. Like that tie.
dialog: I'm suddenly wondering if this
dialog: girl's not the difference.
dialog: Especially when I see her talking
dialog: with David Kross.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN
text: Vivian turns away from the bar, now holding two glasses of
text: champagne. She scans the crowd for Edward.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON EDWARD AND STUCKEY
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: She met him at dinner last
dialog: night... I like this tie.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: So now they're best friends?
dialog: Edward, this girl appears out of
dialog: nowhere and now I see her talking
dialog: to a guy whose company we're
dialog: trying to buy. It's too
dialog: convenient.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You're being ridiculous.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Industrial espionage is not
dialog: ridiculous. Edward, how do you
dialog: know she hasn't attached herself
dialog: to you so she can bring Kross back
dialog: information?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Christ, Bill, she's not a spy,
dialog: she's a hooker. I picked her up
dialog: off Hollywood Boulevard.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN
text: as she hear loud sudden LAUGHTER. She turns. She sees that
text: it's Stuckey laughing. Smiling, Vivian starts towards them with
text: two glasses of champagne.
scene_heading: EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON STUCKEY AND EDWARD
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: I swear to God, you are the only
dialog: millionaire I ever heard of who'd
dialog: go looking for a goddam bargain
dialog: streetwalker!
text: Edward sees Vivian coming.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Let's drop it, shall we?
text: Edward turns. He smiles gently as Vivian quietly approaches
text: and hands him his glass of champagne.
text: A group of BUSINESSMEN are standing a short distance away.
dialog: One of them calls out:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Edward! May we have your opinion
dialog: on something?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (to Vivian and Stuckey)
dialog: Excuse me a moment.
text: He moves to join the group of men. Stuckey gives Vivian a
dialog: broad smile.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Having a good time, Vivian?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah. Thanks.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: All this must be quite a change
dialog: from Hollywood Boulevard.
text: Vivian looks as if she's been struck.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: It's okay. Edward told me. Your
dialog: secret's safe with me.
text: Stuckey runs his hand up her arm.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY (cont'd)
dialog: What do you charge, Vivian?
dialog: Maybe you and I could get together
dialog: after Edward leaves.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (forcing a bitter smile)
dialog: Yeah. Sure. Why not. Call me
dialog: at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: I just might do that.
text: He moves away. Vivian turns. Edward looks up from his
text: conversation, sees her looking at him. He smiles, raises his
text: glass in a small toast. A moment. Vivian toasts him back.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: They enter. Edward switches on a light. Vivian comes down the
text: steps into the room. Edward follows after her.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You're awfully quiet. You haven't
dialog: said a word since the party.
text: As Edward touches her shoulder, Vivian suddenly spins and
text: explodes with anger.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You asshole! I can't believe what
dialog: a --!
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian, what the --
text: Tears well in Vivian's eyes as she yells at him.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Clean the slut up, take her out,
dialog: huh?! What are you trying to
dialog: prove!? I'm not a piece of meat
dialog: for you to offer to your friends!
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I've been with stinking old men
dialog: who've made me want to puke but
dialog: I've never had anyone make me feel
dialog: as dirty as you did tonight.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Would you please calm down. Tell
dialog: me what happened.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Stuckey! He wants an
dialog: "appointment" with me after you
dialog: leave. You my pimp now or did
dialog: he think that up on his own?
text: Edward looks guiltily away.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What was I supposed to do?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I told the truth. Why should the
dialog: truth upset you? It's not as if
dialog: you're from a convent.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I want my fucking money. I'm
dialog: getting out of here. I don't want
dialog: anything more to do with you.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Can we talk about this? Can you
dialog: just try to calm down?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Your goddamned friend, he thinks
dialog: the only reason I'm with you is
dialog: for the money.
text: A tear falls from Vivian's eyes.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (defiantly)
dialog: Well, it's true. Just pay me
dialog: what you owe me and I'm gone.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian...
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Pay me! Before I pick up this
dialog: chair and smash your face in.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Fine. I'm only here a couple
dialog: of more days and I'm not going
dialog: to spend them fighting with you.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Fuck off.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'll call you a cab. If you want
dialog: the clothes, pack them up.
text: Vivian stands quietly for a moment. And then she turns and
text: walks into the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light
text: of the bedroom. As she does she starts crying. With each item
text: of clothing the tears come down harder. Edward appears at the
text: doorway. His face is genuinely concerned.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian... I'm sorry. I wasn't
dialog: prepared for questions about us.
dialog: It was an idiotic and insensitive
dialog: thing I did. I should have known
dialog: that it would hurt you.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I'm not hurt. It doesn't hurt
dialog: you when somebody pisses on you,
dialog: it just pissed you off.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I really am sorry.
text: Vivian lets the clothes fall from her arms. Sobbing, she stands
dialog: limply.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You hurt me.
text: Edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders.
text: She touches his hand. He sits on the bed. He pulls her to him
text: and wraps his arms around her, holds her tight.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'll make it up to you.
scene_heading: INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY
text: Edward, carrying a briefcase, moves jauntily down a long
text: hallway. Stuckey trails after him.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: This is no time to disappear.
dialog: We're in too far.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Bill? Stop panicking. Kross
dialog: isn't going anywhere and I don't
dialog: need to spend the rest of the day
dialog: watching his stock go down. I'll
dialog: be in the office tomorrow.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Promise me you'll read those
dialog: contracts by then.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Goodbye, Bill.
text: Stuckey stops. He calls after Edward.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Shit... By tomorrow, Edward!
text: Edward hurries on.
scene_heading: EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE - DAY
text: Edward exits out of his limo and walks to the front doors.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: Edward smiles, moving jauntily to the elevators. Mr. Thomas
text: at the front desk notices Edward's happy mood.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Afternoon.
text: Edward's attention is taken by the glittering jewelry display
text: in the hotel jewelry store window. He detours from the
text: elevators and moves to the window for a closer look. He thinks
text: a moment and enters the jewelry store.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Vivian comes out of the bedroom into the living room wearing
text: an elegant red sequined evening dress. She looks incredibly
text: beautiful. She sees the phone. A thought occurs to her and
text: going to it, she picks it up. Waits.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: C'mon, Kit...
text: No answer. She hears someone at the door. She hangs up.
text: Edward enters. He is carrying a small case. He stops at the
dialog: sight of Vivian.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Do I look okay?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (a small smile)
dialog: Hmm... let's see... no, there's
dialog: something missing.
text: He holds up the small case.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I don't want you to get too
dialog: excited... these are on loan...
dialog: however...
text: Vivian's jaw drops. Edward is holding a diamond and ruby
text: necklace in his hands, holds it as if it might melt if he
text: breathed too hard. Edward behind Vivian, fastens the
text: necklace around her neck.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: This is made for a princess.
dialog: I think she'd approve of you
dialog: wearing it tonight. There.
dialog: Come look.
text: He leads her to a mirror. She stares at her reflection.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Edward, I can't.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Shush. Of course you can.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What if I lose it?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You won't.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What if someone tries to steal
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'll guard them and you with my
dialog: life.
scene_heading: EDT. BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY
text: A limo pulls onto the tarmac at Burbank Airport. A PILOT in
text: a leather jacket and sunglasses hurries forward to open the limo
text: door. Edward -- now wearing evening clothes -- and Vivian climbs
text: out of the limo.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Your plane is ready to go, Mr.
dialog: Harris.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Very good.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Plane?
text: Taking her arm, Edward leads her across the tarmac.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You don't want to go all the way
dialog: to San Francisco in a limousine,
dialog: do you? I don't.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Where are you taking me!?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: To meet some friends. Rudolpho,
dialog: a poet... Benoit, a landlord...
dialog: Mimi, a flower maker...
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: The opera.
text: Up ahead is a waiting private jet, its engines already HUMMING.
text: She is speechless. Edward grins, loving the look on her face.
scene_heading: EXT. BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY
text: The corporate jet takes off down the landing strip.
scene_heading: INT. CORPORATE JET - DAY
text: Edward and Vivian are alone in the passenger lounge of the jet.
text: Vivian can't believe the cabin. It is a comfortable room
text: featuring a long couch that curves across two walls, built in
text: bar, television and stereo. Edward is once again, going over
dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I've never been on a plane
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'm glad you like it. Now be
dialog: quiet, I've really got to read
dialog: these.
text: Vivian fluffs her hair up. She makes a happy, excited growling
text: sound -- Rrrrr! A wicked gleam comes to her eye.
text: She walks over to Edward and stands in front of him. He looks
text: up. She parts the thigh high slit in her gown to expose silken
text: quarters. She begins to unfasten the garters one at a time.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian, what do you think you're
dialog: doing?
text: Edward watches silk stockings slide down Vivian's lovely legs.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Being quiet.
text: She reaches out and gently caresses Edward's face. Edward sets
dialog: down his papers.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SUNSET
text: The setting sun casts an incredibly glow over the city and the
dialog: coast.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (O.S.)
dialog: You ever been in love with
dialog: anyone?
scene_heading: INT. CORPORATE JET - SUNSET
text: Vivian is at the window, looking out. She carefully puts her
text: earrings back on. She stares, mesmerized by the skyline, the
text: golden gate bridge in the distance. She turns. Edward is
text: buttoning his shirt. He is silent.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Sorry. You're not paying me to
dialog: ask you question like that.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian. I'm paying you to be
dialog: you. Be you.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Have you? Ever been in love with
dialog: anyone?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You mean, besides Elvis?
dialog: (turning back to the
dialog: window)
dialog: I'm a human being. Sure. Once.
dialog: First time I ever ran away from
dialog: home, I got as far as Atlanta.
dialog: I met this boy. He'd been with
dialog: his parents on their way to
dialog: Chicago. They stopped at a gas
dialog: station. He went to the john.
dialog: When he came back they'd split.
dialog: We sorta started looking out for
dialog: each other. Aw, he was sweet.
dialog: And boy, was he good looking,
dialog: y'know, dark hair and eyes.
text: The chicken hawks were on him all
dialog: the time. He hated that.
dialog: Sometimes we'd find a safe place
dialog: to crash nights and we'd curl up
dialog: together and we'd talk about all
dialog: these crazy things. The two of
dialog: us getting married someday.
dialog: Having kids. Stupid stuff.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What happened to him?
text: A moment. Vivian shrugs.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: My father found me. Dragged me
dialog: home. I don't know why, he never
dialog: seemed to like me much when I was
dialog: there.
dialog: (a bitter smile)
dialog: 'Cept when he was drunk, then he
dialog: liked me a whole lot.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: I made it back to Atlanta a year
dialog: later. Andy was gone.
text: Silence. Vivian stares out the window.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Aw, but things sure look fine
dialog: when you're sitting way up high.
text: Edward moves close to Vivian and putting an arm around her
text: shoulders, stares with her out at the view. Vivian rests her
text: head against him.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT
text: An airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the San Francisco
text: Opera House. The DRIVER walks around back and opens the
text: passenger door. Edward emerges and helps Vivian out.
scene_heading: INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Edward puts his hand on Vivian's elbow as they walk through
dialog: the elegant lobby.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Some people say that opera is an
dialog: acquired taste, but I don't
dialog: believe it. You can always tell
dialog: when someone goes to the opera
dialog: for the first time. They either
dialog: love it or hate it. Those who
dialog: love it will always love it; those
dialog: who hate it might come to
dialog: appreciate it, but they'll never
dialog: truly love it.
text: Vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit
text: fountain with several graceful statues in its center.
text: Everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed WOMEN and
text: prosperous looking MEN. It makes her nervous. Without
text: realizing it, she raises a protective hand up to her necklace.
text: She looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and
dialog: steal it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Viv? I really doubt if anyone
dialog: here is going to try and grab it.
text: Vivian reluctantly lowers her hands.
scene_heading: INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT
text: A crowd of PEOPLE mill around the lobby, heading toward their
text: seats. Vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes
text: -- curious, even envious looks from the WOMEN, appreciative
text: glances from the MEN. Her hands again rises nervously to her
dialog: necklace.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: They all think you look very
dialog: beautiful, Vivian.
text: Vivian gives him a grateful look. Relaxing, she lowers her hand
text: from the necklace. With a flourish, he offers his arm. She
text: takes it. They start forward.
scene_heading: INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT
text: Edward and Vivian take their seats in a box high above the
dialog: stage.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: If it's in Italian, how will I
dialog: know what they're saying?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'll whisper some of the main
dialog: parts of the story to you. But
dialog: you'll be surprised how much you
dialog: understand. The music conveys
dialog: the story more powerfully than
dialog: any words.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: But don't they have it in
dialog: English?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian, don't be afraid of what
dialog: you don't know. That's the fun
dialog: of it.
text: The lights dim.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (resigned)
dialog: Okay. Even if I hate it, I'm
dialog: glad you brought me.
text: The orchestra begins to play. Vivian's eyes focus intensely
text: on the stage, as if a new world is about to be revealed to her.
scene_heading: INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE STATE - NIGHT
text: IN A MONTAGE OF IMAGES AND MUSIC - LA BOHEME is performed.
text: The lights from the stage dance across Vivian's face. Edward
text: leans over to translate the tenor's aria.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What am I? I am a poet. Not
dialog: a man of wealth but one rich in
dialog: dreams. You have come to replace
dialog: my vanished dreams. I dwell now
dialog: only in your eyes.
text: The MUSIC ebbs and swells. The sets and costumes change. The
dialog: story continues.
text: Edward again leans close to Vivian.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: And now she asks Rudolpho if he
dialog: still thinks her beautiful --
text: Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth. Her eyes
text: are fixed on the stage. She doesn't need his help.
text: The emotions building inside Vivian swell as the music is
text: reaching its tragic climax. Her lips tremble. Her eyes fill
text: with tears. Edward glances at her. He studies her a long
text: moment, watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face.
text: Strangely moved, he takes Vivian's hand.
text: As the opera ends, they are both swept away by it.
scene_heading: INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT
text: As the lights come up, Vivian wipes off her tear-ruined
text: mascara. She sighs, happy. The WOMEN in the next box smile
dialog: at her.
speaker_heading: OLDER WOMAN
dialog: Did you enjoy the opera, dear?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (tearfully)
dialog: It was so beautiful I just about
dialog: pissed my pants.
text: Edward smiles at the now shocked looking Older Woman and he
text: and the still misty Vivian exit.
scene_heading: INT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT - LATER
text: Edward and Vivian sit side by side.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: If you'd gone on about how much
dialog: you liked it, I'm not sure I'd
dialog: have believed you.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I more than liked it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I know. I'm glad.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes. I've never enjoyed it more.
dialog: Thank you.
text: Vivian looks at him a moment. And then, leaning slowly forward
text: she kisses him gently on the mouth. He looks at her surprise.
text: He puts his arms around her and kisses her back. It is the
dialog: first time they've kissed and they make it very special.
scene_heading: EXT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT
text: The plane flies in the night. Back to L.A.
scene_heading: INT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: IN A SERIES OF CROSS FADES Edward and Vivian make love.
text: Equally giving, equally taking. No masks, no shields.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER
text: In the darkened bedroom, Edward and Vivian lie together.
text: Edward cradles Vivian. Her back rests against his chest. His
text: arm is over her body.
text: She takes Edward's hand in her hands and carefully examines
text: it; marveling at the fingers, the tiny hairs on the back. She
text: gently kisses the palm.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Love you...
text: She clutches Edward's hand tightly to her breast. She closes
text: her eyes, ready to sleep now.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - ANGLE ON EDWARD - NIGHT
text: His eyes open. Vivian's whispered endearment has filled with
text: him with sudden confusion and uncertainty. He stares into the
text: dark, wondering what to do with the woman in his arms.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - OUTDOOR PATIO - MORNING
text: The phone rings. Edward immediately reaches out and picks it
text: up. He is dressed in a robe. Breakfast is on the umbrella'd
text: table in front of him.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes?
scene_heading: INT. STUCKEY'S HOME - LIBRARY- MORNING - INTERCUT
text: Stuckey, not even dressed yet, paces around his desk.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Did I wake you?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'm up.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: I had to call. I jus got off
dialog: the phone with James Kross. Get
dialog: this. He wants to see you.
dialog: Today.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: He wouldn't say. Edward... I
dialog: think we got him. His nuts are
dialog: on the block and we got him.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: You there?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Give me twenty minutes.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: We'll be there. Listen, if he's
dialog: really caving in, we'll go from
dialog: there down to the office. I want
dialog: him to commit his stock to us this
dialog: morning.
text: Edward hangs up. His mind seems on other things. He rises.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Vivian is still asleep. She is face down on the bed, the
text: sheets just covering her to her waist. Edward stares down at
text: her. He gently reaches out and runs a finger down the soft line
text: of her spine. Vivian murmurs contentedly.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Mmm.
dialog: (opening her eyes;
dialog: looking at him)
dialog: Hi.
text: Edward smiles at her softly. And then:
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Better get dressed. We're having
dialog: guests.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY
text: Vivian is wearing her yellow dress. She stares at herself in
text: the bedroom mirror. Her hair... her make-up... she realizes
text: how different she is now, realizes that she likes it.
text: Edward comes out of the bathroom. He crosses to the closet
dialog: for a tie.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Here. Let me.
text: She comes over, starts to tie his tie for him. He is very
text: aware of the closeness of her. She smiles at him. He smiles;
text: puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment. Looking up,
text: she sees that he is serious now; no more jokes. He releases
dialog: her hand.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: One more night and you're finally
dialog: rid of me.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah, you've been pretty tough
dialog: to take.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I have to go to New York
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: Vivian says nothing.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (cont'd)
dialog: But I'll be back in Los Angeles.
dialog: Soon. I'd like to see you again.
dialog: I thought we could work out
dialog: something... An arrangement.
dialog: Vivian is silent.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (cont'd)
dialog: I'll get you an apartment, buy
dialog: you a car --
text: Vivian sighs, letting something go inside. Finished with his
text: tie, she turns away.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (cont'd)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (not unkindly)
dialog: What else? You gonna leave some
dialog: cash by the bed when you pass
dialog: through town?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It wouldn't be like that. I want
dialog: to get you off the street. You'll
dialog: have a different kind of life.
dialog: What's wrong with that?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I'm sorry. That's very sweet,
dialog: Edward, and I know you mean it...
text: She is silent.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian, I've thought about this
dialog: a lot. This is the best solution.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (shakes her head "no,"
dialog: then continues tying
dialog: his tie)
dialog: When I was a little girl, my
dialog: mother locked me in the attic when
dialog: I was bad, which was pretty often.
dialog: I'd stare out the window up there
dialog: and make believe I was a princess
dialog: trapped in the tower by the wicked
text: queen. Then suddenly a knight
text: on a white horse with his bright
dialog: colors flying would ride up.
dialog: Rescue me from the tower, and then
dialog: we'd ride off... but never, ever
dialog: in all the times I had that dream
dialog: did the knight say, "Come on baby,
dialog: I'll put you up in a great condo."
dialog: She finished his tie.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (softly; to herself)
dialog: I know.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Hey, don't mind me. I'm being
dialog: stupid.
dialog: (more)
dialog: I'll think about it, okay? It's
dialog: a real good offer for a whore.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I've never treated you like a
dialog: whore.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (not mean)
dialog: You just did.
text: The doorbell suddenly rings in the living room.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Edward enters the living room. Vivian slowly enters behind
text: him. Edward opens the front door. Mr. Kross slowly enters.
text: He looks very old and tired; so much so that Edward has to mask
dialog: his surprise.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: Mr. Harris.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: How are you, Mr. Kross.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: Not bad for a man who hasn't
dialog: slept in four nights. I'll get
dialog: used to it.
text: An angry, reluctant looking David Kross is behind his father.
text: Stuckey brings up the rear. Edward and David give one another
text: perfunctory nod. Stuckey smugly winks at Edward. Edward closes
text: the door and leads them all down the stairs.
text: Vivian is very troubled at Kross's appearance. He gently nods
dialog: at Vivian.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: Young lady.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Hello.
dialog: (to David)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello, Vivian.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Let's not waste time here, shall
dialog: we? Mr. Kross, you said this
dialog: morning, you wished to speak with
text: Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris is now
dialog: listening.
text: Kross has to fight down his humiliation at Stuckey's tone. He
dialog: turns to Edward.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: Yes. I'm here to tell you that
dialog: I've reconsidered my position on
dialog: your acquisition offer.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Expected... offer.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: Of course, yes. After the
dialog: expected filing period is over,
dialog: I'm going to recommend to the
dialog: board that we accept your bid.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: You're making the right decision,
dialog: sir.
text: Stuckey glances triumphantly at Edward. He is surprised to
text: see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in Edward's face.
text: Edward is silent. Kross interprets his silence as second
dialog: thoughts.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: I'll see you on one condition.
dialog: I'm not so concerned for me but
dialog: the people who have worked for
dialog: me...
text: Vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: They'll be taken care of. Won't
dialog: they, Edward?
text: Kross ignores Stuckey. He looks to Edward. Edward slowly
dialog: nods.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: I'll sign anything you want then.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Today.
text: Kross nods tiredly. His voice is very soft.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: Today.
text: Vivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom,
text: obviously upset. The men all watch her go. Edward hesitates.
dialog: He turns to Kross:
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Excuse me, please?
text: He heads to the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY
text: Vivian is sitting on the bed, on the phone.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Hello. Is Kit DeLuca there?
dialog: When she comes in will you have
dialog: her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000.
dialog: Yes. Okay.
text: She hangs up as Edward comes in.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What did you do to him?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Last time I saw him he was this
text: strong guy. Now he's beaten.
dialog: And you liked him.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian, I want you to listen to
dialog: me. The man realized that it
dialog: would be better for his future
dialog: and his son's future, if he
dialog: cooperated.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It's not your concern. It's...
dialog: business, that's all.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Business.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes. The man made a business
dialog: decision.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: It's all just business to you.
dialog: Him. Me. Your life.
dialog: Everything's business.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It's what I do for a living.
dialog: It's how I make money.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'll be back in a few hours.
dialog: We'll talk about this later.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Edward enters the living room. The men look at him
dialog: expectantly.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: We'll continue this down at the
dialog: office.
text: He heads for the door.
scene_heading: EXT. PENTHOUSE PATIO - DAY
text: Vivian stands at the railing, unhappily looking out at the city
text: beyond. The phone RINGS. She turns and hurries inside.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Vivian answers the phone.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Lo?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY - INTERCUT
text: Mr. Thomas is standing behind the front desk, a rather strained
text: expression on his face.
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: Barnard Thomas here. Miss
dialog: Vivian, I wonder if you might come
dialog: down to the front desk. There's
dialog: someone here to see you.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: MR. THOMAS
dialog: I'd send them up, but sadly, I
dialog: don't trust the young lady to find
dialog: you on her own.
text: A hand reaches out and wrenches the phone away from Mr. Thomas.
text: Kit, heavy make-up, skimpy outfit, chewing gum, cigarette and
text: all, keeps her voice just below a bellow.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Viv? Where are you, babe?
dialog: (glaring at Mr. Thomas)
dialog: The sphincter-police won't let
dialog: me through.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - DAY
text: Kit finishes slurping on a big, frosty ice cream soda. She
text: smacks her lips like a happy, little girl. Vivian isn't having
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yes, I'm glad you're clean but
dialog: I've been calling and calling.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Was that you?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Who did you think?
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Carlos. I still owe him two
dialog: hundred bucks...
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Kit, I left that money for you
dialog: days ago.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Yeah. I just got it.
text: An OLDER COUPLE walk past the table. They stare at Kit.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Fifty bucks, grampa. For
dialog: seventy-five, the wife can watch.
text: Horrified, the elderly couple hurry away.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Kit...
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Everybody keeps starin' at me.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yeah... I know what you mean.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: What do you know? You look good.
dialog: All dressed up.
dialog: (meaning it)
dialog: You clean up real nice.
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: You sure don't fit in down on
dialog: the Boulevard, lookin' like you
dialog: do. Not that you ever did anyway.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You think I fit here where they
dialog: just about chew your food for you?
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Where do you fit?
text: Vivian is silent, then.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: I kissed him, Kit. On the mouth.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Honey, you're not supposed to
dialog: do that.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I know. I stopped pretending
dialog: and started liking it with him
dialog: for real.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (miserably)
dialog: It was great.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Dummy.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: He wants to set me up in a place,
dialog: give me some money.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: I pray for that.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: All I'm doing is feeling lousy
dialog: about it. I don't know what to
dialog: do. What do I do, Kit?
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Go for the bucks.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I don't care about bucks.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I might love this guy.
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Wow, are you in deep shit.
dialog: (a sigh)
dialog: You know he'll break your heart.
text: Vivian is silent again.
speaker_heading: KIT (cont'd)
dialog: I blame myself here. First time
dialog: I laid eyes on ya', I knew you
dialog: were too complicated to be a
dialog: whore.
text: Vivian nods. Her face is filled with confusion.
scene_heading: INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Edward stands at the window looking out. There is something
dialog: about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look we've just
dialog: seen on Vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of
dialog: the story.
text: Jake enters, a pile of papers under his arm. He begins laying
text: them out on the conference table.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Congratulations, sir.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Mr. Kross is just getting off
text: the phone with his stock broker.
dialog: It's finished. You've won.
dialog: Edward says nothing.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Who are you going after next, sir?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Who indeed...
text: He turns as Stuckey, James and David Kross, and Vance enter
text: the room. They surround a conference table. Kross sits, the
text: papers laid out in front of him. Stuckey hands Kross a pen.
text: A SECRETARY lays out finger food. They wait for her to leave
dialog: before they speak.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: If we can get these letters of
dialog: intent out of the way now... Mr.
dialog: Harris and I would like to ask
dialog: you some questions about your
dialog: company.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Dad, excuse me, but that's
dialog: inappropriate. You're under no
dialog: obligation to answer any questions
dialog: at all.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: Could we at least wait till after
dialog: the filing period?
text: Stuckey glances to Edward for help. Edward is silent; indeed
text: it's as if something is twisting inside of him. Stuckey plunges
dialog: ahead.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
text: Mr. Harris is preparing a bid
dialog: based on our speculation of the
dialog: corporation's net worth. The
dialog: price he ultimately pays for your
dialog: father's stock will be based on
dialog: that bid. The more we know, the
dialog: higher our bid can be.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: It's in my best interest to
dialog: cooperate, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If he throws himself on your
dialog: sword, you promise to take care
dialog: of him and his family, huh?
text: David stares at him.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: That's unfair!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You bed it is.
dialog: (to Edward)
dialog: You're everything he said you
dialog: were.
dialog: (to his father)
dialog: Do what you have to do, Dad.
dialog: Just don't expect me to watch it.
text: He exits. A moment. Kross looks at Edward with a resigned
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: He's young. He hasn't learned
dialog: how to lose gracefully yet. I'll
dialog: sign your papers. And I'll answer
dialog: your questions. Whatever you
dialog: want.
text: He sighs. He picks up the pen. He's about to sign.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Stop. For just a moment.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you
dialog: a few questions before you sign.
dialog: You realize that you're a target.
dialog: If you weren't mine, you'd be
dialog: someone elses, correct?
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: If you had a... reprieve, what
dialog: would do?
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: I don't think there's any sense
dialog: in --
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Let him answer.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: I... I would take advantage of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: How?
text: Kross looks uncertain. He gropes for an answer.
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: I... I don't know. There...
dialog: there wasn't time...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I suppose you'd find out soon
dialog: enough that you have assets you
dialog: presently don't seem aware of,
dialog: wouldn't you? The waste
dialog: processing licenses at that
dialog: abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd
dialog: certainly find out about that.
text: Surprise suddenly flares in Stuckey's eyes.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Oh, my god... Edward, no!
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I suppose you'd use them as
dialog: collateral on new loans, wouldn't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Have you lost your mind?
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: (to Stuckey)
dialog: Quiet.
dialog: (to Edward)
dialog: Would I get the loans?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: This time I imagine you would,
dialog: yes.
dialog: (as if thinking about
dialog: it)
dialog: Hmm...
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: With all this in mind, Mr. Kross,
dialog: I can't logically make a formal
dialog: bid on your company, can I?
speaker_heading: KROSS
dialog: (a small smile)
dialog: You'd be initiating a financial
dialog: battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr.
dialog: Harris.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You're very right. I think the
dialog: best thing we could all do is go
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Have a good day, gentlemen.
text: He exits from the room. Stuckey follows.
scene_heading: INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY
text: Edward is walking down the hall. Stuckey comes out of the
text: office and calls after him.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Edward, what happened? What kind
dialog: of move was that?
text: Edward silently goes into the elevators. The doors close.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: (yells)
dialog: Dammit Edward, speak to me.
text: Stuckey heads back to the conference room.
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Edward comes out of the building. His Chauffeur leaps to open
dialog: the limo door.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No... take the car back to the
dialog: hotel. I need to walk.
text: He sets off across Century Park East.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - EVENING
text: Vivian is in the living room, pacing, edgy, the doorbell rings.
text: She turns. It rings again.
text: She opens it. Stuckey is standing outside with a small
text: briefcase. He looks agitated. He tries to hide it.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Well, well... Hello again. I'm
dialog: looking for Edward.
text: Vivian just stares at him.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Edward's not back. I thought
dialog: he was with you.
text: Stuckey walks past her and down the steps into the living room.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: No, I'll just have to wait then,
dialog: won't I?
text: There is a bar set up. Stuckey sets his briefcase down. He
text: crosses to the bar.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY (cont'd)
dialog: Mind if I have a drink?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: No.
text: He pours liquor in a glass. He fires it down. It seems to
dialog: calm him a bit.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Do you want to know what he did?
dialog: Do you want to know what the crazy
dialog: son of a bitch did? He handed
dialog: the whole thing back to Kross!
text: On a silver platter. For no
dialog: reason! What was he thinking,
dialog: I mean, what was going through
dialog: his goddam head? Why?
dialog: (pours another drink)
dialog: What was all that benevolent
dialog: crap? What are we going to
dialog: become, a philanthropic
dialog: foundation? I'll probably be the
dialog: director of several worthwhile
dialog: charities.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I think it's great.
text: Stuckey glares at Vivian.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: I bet. A lousy whore and you're
dialog: the gum in a hundred million
dialog: dollar deal.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: Aw, come on, Bill. It's just
dialog: business.
text: He looks at her a moment.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: But what do I know, maybe you're
dialog: worth it. Come on, show me.
dialog: Let's see your act.
text: He grabs her wrist.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Get out!
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Don't worry. I'll pay for it.
dialog: What a you charge? Huh? Twenty,
dialog: thirty, fifty bucks, maybe? Are
dialog: you a fifty dollar whore?
text: He tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top
dialog: of him.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Are you crazy?
text: She bites his hand. Stuckey slaps her. Vivian starts flailing
text: back. But Stuckey is too strong. Vivian staggers back at the
text: force of another slap. Stuckey slams her up against a wall and
text: starts rubbing up against her.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: You got a mean streak in you,
dialog: don't you.
text: He tries to kiss her again.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY (cont'd)
dialog: Is that what he likes about you?
dialog: Huh? Answer me!
text: And suddenly a HAND lands on Stuckey's shoulder. Stuckey turns
text: his head, startled.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - REVERSE ANGLE - STUCKEY'S P.O.V.
text: Edward, murder in his eyes, belts Stuckey across the room.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT - BACK TO SCENE
text: Stuckey falls on the ground. Edward rushes forward, berserk
text: with rage, to hit Stuckey again. His fist hits the top of
text: Stuckey's head, hurting Edward's hand more than Stuckey's skull.
text: Vivian rushes out of room to bathroom. Again Stuckey tries
text: to rise. Edward kicks him in the butt, sends him headfirst into
text: the bar. Glasses and bottles CRASH to the floor. Stuckey again
text: tries to rise. And collapses. Edward rubs his fist. They're
text: not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: You broke my nose.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I think I broke my hand.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You're fired.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Edward, we've been together ten
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: And I don't like what we've
dialog: become. I'll cover any losses
dialog: you have on this one. Now get
dialog: out, you asshole!
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: All this because of that whore!
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yes.
text: Edward pushes Stuckey out the door and throws his briefcase
dialog: after him.
speaker_heading: STUCKEY
dialog: Edward, think about what you're
dialog: --
text: Edward slams the door in his face. Edward stands there,
text: reflecting on what he's done.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (to himself, almost
dialog: proud)
dialog: Well, I didn't plan that!
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER
text: Edward holds an icepack to Vivian's cheek.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Why do guys always know how to
dialog: hit a woman? Right across the
dialog: cheek, wham, so it feels like your
dialog: eye is gonna explode. What do
dialog: they do, take you all aside in
dialog: high school and show you how?
dialog: It pisses me off!
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Not all men hit. And no one is
dialog: going to hit you anymore.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Right.
dialog: (softening)
dialog: You're quite the Sir Galahad
dialog: today, aren't ya'?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I heard what you did with Kross.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It was a business decision.
text: Vivian looks at him.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I got tired of hating my father.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (a small smile)
dialog: It was good.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It felt good.
text: Edward looks on the bed at her suitcases.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You're packing.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I'm leaving.
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Don't ya see? If I stay with
dialog: you like you want me to, there'll
dialog: always be some guy, your friends
dialog: eve, treatin' me like that...
dialog: thinkin' they're allowed to. What
dialog: are you gonna do, fight'm all?
dialog: No. I'll take my money now,
dialog: please.
text: A moment. Edward reaches for his wallet. He counts out bills.
text: He places them in Vivian's suitcase. He puts his arms around
dialog: Vivian.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Aw, don't... no...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Stay with me tonight. Not
dialog: because you're being paid to.
dialog: Stay with me because you want to.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I do. I do want to. That's why
dialog: I'm leaving.
dialog: (turning to him)
dialog: That's what you given me, see?
dialog: I know what I want now. I want
dialog: a guy like you for real. Not
dialog: because you buy me things and give
dialog: me money. The nicest thing you
dialog: ever done for me is hold my hand.
dialog: You gonna give me that?
text: Edward is silent.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I didn't think so.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Vivian...
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: It's not your fault. You're
dialog: right. Kit's right.
dialog: (looks him right in the
dialog: eye)
dialog: But I want the fairy tale.

dialog: Thanks.

speaker_heading: VIVIAN

speaker_heading: VIVIAN

scene_heading: EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: The limo pulls to a stop in front of a rundown apartment
text: building on a dirty Hollywood side street. The Limo Driver,

text: uncomfortably. Ths is rough neighborhood. He opens the door.
text: Vivian steps out.
speaker_heading: LIMO DRIVER
dialog: Maybe I should go with you. This
dialog: doesn't look like a good place
dialog: for a lady to be alone.
text: Several PEOPLE pass. All of them stare at the car, at the

speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I'll be okay. I'm home. Thank
dialog: you.
text: The driver, confused, watches her hurry up the steps to the

scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY
text: Edward stands at the penthouse window, looking out. He is

speaker_heading: BELLMAN
dialog: Is that everything, sir?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (turning from the

dialog: That's everything.

dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Yeah. Got a cigarette?
speaker_heading: KIT
dialog: Sure.
text: She passes the girl down the pack. She strikes a match, lights

text: a sigh. She looks towards the window.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Jeez, did the wacko in the suit.
text: Kit turns to look.

speaker_heading: KIT (O.S.)
dialog: Edward Harris, as I live and
dialog: breathe!
text: Edward quickly turns to find Kit staring at him. Kit smiles,
text: triumphantly.
speaker_heading: KIT (cont'd)

scene_heading: INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Vivian sits on her bed, lost in thought. Her bags are packed,
text: ready to go. With a sigh she rises. She picks up the bags,
text: exits the room.
text: Vivian stands in the dreary living room, looking at it, taking
text: it all in for the last time. She suddenly looks more than a
text: little bit frightened to be leaving. She musters resolve. She
text: goes to the door, opens it and exits, closing it behind her.
text: Silence. Vivian suddenly comes back in. She puts down her
text: bags. She crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee
text: can/piggy bank from the shelf. She puts some more bills into
text: it, places it back where Kit will find it.
text: She turns and starts again for the door.
text: She stops. She hears something. MUSIC. An aria from La
text: Boheme. Faint. Seemingly coming from nowhere. She dismisses
text: it -- she's hearing things. She opens the door. Stops. The
text: music is louder and getting louder now -- it's not her
text: imagination. She hurries over to the window.
scene_heading: EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Vivian comes out onto the fire escape. She stares in wonder.
text: A snow white limo comes up the street. A necktie has been tied
text: to the antennae like a knight's token. The MUSIC from La Boheme
text: is BLARING from the car's stereo. Edward is standing on the
text: car's seat, his head and body up through the open sunroof. The
text: wind blows at his hair. He is smiling.
text: Everywhere on the street people are staring; the BUMS, the
text: PUSHERS, the PASSERBY'S, the TOURISTS.
text: Vivian doesn't know whether to laugh or cry.
text: The car comes to a stop in front of the Vivian's building.
text: Vivian's landlord comes out the front door. His eyes go wide
dialog: in disbelief.
text: Edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the
text: sunroof. He leaps nimbly to the ground. He crosses to the entrance
text: of the alleyway, looking up at Vivian on the fire escape.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You are really lost this time.
text: Edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her.
text: With a sudden cry of joy, Vivian comes down the fire escape.
text: She stops at the bottom stair. Edward comes forward and sweeps
text: her into his arms. They kiss.
text: He carries her to the limo as if she's weightless. Her feet
dialog: never touch the ground.
text: The car door closes behind them. The limo drives away.
text: The people of the street watch it go.
