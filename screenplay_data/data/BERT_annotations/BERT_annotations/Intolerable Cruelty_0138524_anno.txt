scene_heading: BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT
text: It is late night, and deserted. Engine noise approaches;
text: headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing.
text: It is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing --
text: a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano -- whooshes by with
dialog: it.
text: We hold as another car approaches. This one is a conservative
text: sedan, whose occupant does not sing.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE
text: The middle-aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt
text: and cocked bow tie. He is flushed, a Rogue forelock bouncing
text: over his forehead, and he merrily sings "Casey Jones" along
text: with the passenger, a young woman in a party dress who
text: squeals, rocks with the motion of the car, and
text: enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus.
scene_heading: ANOTHER EMPTY STREET
text: The convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and
text: approaches with its singing.
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: The car enters and roars away. After a beat of quiet, the
text: conservative sedan enters and recedes.
speaker_heading: BEACH
text: We are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel. The singing,
text: squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a
dialog: halt.
text: The young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a
text: half-empty bottle of champagne.
text: The man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Number Seven.
text: She trots away.
text: The man twists his rear-view mirror to look at himself. He
text: straightens his bow tie. He puffs his bounding forelock with
text: one finger, nods his head to make it bounce, grins
text: approvingly, and cocks a pistol-finger at his own reflection.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Zing!
speaker_heading: MOTEL ROOM
text: The man enters and looks around. The young woman's dress is
text: tossed onto the bed but she is nowhere to be seen.
text: The man pulls an imaginary train whistle.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Choo! Choo!...
text: He looks around, in a closet, under the bed.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'm a locomotive, baby! I'm the Wabash
dialog: cannonball! I'm a hunka-hunka
dialog: burninnnnn' love! I got fire in my
dialog: boiler and a fuh -- a fuh --
text: He is reacting to a long leg which pokes out from behind the
text: window curtain.
text: A salacious smiles spreads across his lips. He pulls on the
text: cord to draw back the curtain and reveal the young woman in
text: red panties and a bra and a saucily cocked conductor's cap.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Tickets, please.
text: The man is stripping off his clothes.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Excuse me, Miss, is this the train
dialog: to Ecsssstasy?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Pull in your ears, Rexie -- you're
dialog: comin' to a tunnel!
text: Rex lunges at the young woman and they tumble onto the bed
dialog: just as --
text: CRASH -- the door is kicked open and a short stocky black
text: man built like a bulldog and wearing a porkpie hat rushes
text: into the room with a video camera glued to his eye. He looks
text: like Clarence Thomas with a mustache.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'm gonna nail your ass!
text: The young woman screams, clutching the sheets to her naked
text: bosom. Rex leaps from the bed, still clad only in his
text: chemindefer boxers, and darts around the room seeking egress.
text: The man with the video charges around the room following Rex
speaker_heading: THE VIDEO IMAGE
text: Rex is stumbling around the room in a panic, looking for his
text: clothing. The camera swish-pans back to the young woman still
text: screaming in the bed.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'm gonna nail your ass!!
text: We swish-pan back to Rex as he bends over to pick up his
text: trousers, mooning us.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'm gonna nail your ass!
text: PULL BACK FROM THE VIDEO IMAGE
dialog: To reveal that we are in the detective -- Gus Petch's --
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I nailed his ass.
text: Faintly, from the television monitor we hear screaming and
dialog: mayhem.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Trains...
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
text: Watching the monitor, MARYLIN REXROTH is a sensual beauty,
text: with intelligence and class. She watches the monitor without
dialog: expression.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: ...I thought he'd outgrown trains.
text: Gus Petch sits behind a desk.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: They never grow-up, lady. They just
dialog: get tubby. Me, I've always had ample
dialog: proportions. But it's all muscle --
text: I'm hard as a rock. I'm not on of
text: these cream puff sit-behind-a desk
dialog: private dicks; I'm an assnailer
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: So I see.
text: Faintly, from the monitor:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm gonna nail your ass.
text: We hear the Young Woman SQUEAL. Marylin reacts.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Hard to believe that's the best he
dialog: could do.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Probably you're the best he could
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Oh. Thank you.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You're takin' it pretty well. I seen
dialog: 'em weep like they'd hired me to
dialog: prove their husbands weren't fooling
dialog: around. And I seen 'em celebrate.
dialog: Like I just handed 'em a winning
dialog: lottery ticket.
text: Marylin turns her attention back to the screen.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I'm just enjoying the movie.
scene_heading: TRACKING SHOT
text: All from the perspective of a moving automobile.
text: The moving shots show mansions, palm trees, boutiques; we
text: pass joggers, strolling businessmen holding cellular phones
text: to their ears, male models working as waiters at sidewalk
text: cafes, young women on roller blades who turn, smile, and
text: wave at the camera. It is la dolce vita Los Angeles style.
speaker_heading: THE DRIVER
text: A handsome, fortyish man in a town car talks into cellular
text: phone. This is MILES MASSEY.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: -- hello Marjory, any messages? Yeah?
dialog: Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Have Wrigley look
dialog: up Oliphant v. Oliphant for its
dialog: relevance to the Chapman filing. She
dialog: took the kids where? Tahoe? Which
dialog: side of Tahoe. Great. If the cruise
dialog: goes all the way around the lake,
dialog: she left the state and she's in
dialog: breach. She can't leave the state.
dialog: Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to
dialog: attach everything. Primary residence,
dialog: autos, stocks...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Sure. Put him through.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Hello Ross. What? She's sleeping
dialog: with the nanny? Well, you're
dialog: separated. She can sleep with -- is
dialog: this the one you slept with? Oh. A
dialog: guy? Interesting career choice. Hmmm?
dialog: Yes. I know you want her dead.
dialog: Everyone in your tax bracket wants
dialog: their ex wives dead.
scene_heading: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS MANSE
text: Rex is trying his key in the front door of his house. Finding
text: it doesn't, work he rattles the knob, then leans on the
text: doorbell.
text: We hear distant chimes.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Honey! ...Honey?!
text: Finally, through the intercom:
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Rex. Get away from the door.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Look, Marylin, can't we have a
dialog: civilized discussion about this?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
text: We are. And it's winding down.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: But Marylin, you know a divorce would
dialog: ruin me right now. Everything I have --
dialog: everything we have -- is tied up in
dialog: my business. The business is my entire
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Are you forgetting about the Atcheson,
dialog: Topeka and the Santa Fe?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Marylin?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Rex. Go away. I don't want to have
dialog: to sic the dogs on you.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Dogs?
text: From inside the house we hear the menacing sound of LARGE
text: DOGS BARKING.
speaker_heading: LETTERING
text: On an interior wall; it says MASSEY, MEYERSON, SLOAN &amp;
scene_heading: GURALNICK.
text: A pull back shows that we are in a waiting room, and a
text: receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Rex Rexroth.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Mr. Massey will be right with you.
scene_heading: INT. MASSEY MEYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Miles addresses a group of young Attorneys at the firm.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: The problem is that everyone is
dialog: willing to compromise. That's the
dialog: problem with the institution of
dialog: marriage -- it's based on compromise.
dialog: Even through its dissolution. One
dialog: attorney will try to score some
dialog: points, the opposition will try to
dialog: impeach. The process will find an
dialog: equilibrium point determined by the
dialog: skill of the opposing lawyers, and
dialog: then each party will walk away with
dialog: their portion of the "goodies." Some
dialog: say, "Life is compromise." But at
dialog: Massey Myerson we believe life is
dialog: struggle and the ultimate destruction
dialog: of your opponent.
text: The Receptionist pokes her head into the conference room.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Your eleven o'clock is here.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen -- we will
dialog: continue this at the Associates
text: Meeting next Friday. In the meantime,
dialog: I want you to consider this... Ivan
dialog: the Terrible, Henry the VIII, Attila
dialog: the Hun -- what did they have in
dialog: common?
text: As he exits.
speaker_heading: ASSOCIATE
dialog: Middle names?
scene_heading: MILES MASSEY'S OFFICE
dialog: You may have seen it in the issue before last of "World of
text: Interiors." There's a Rothko on the wall, an Elle Bleu humidor
text: on the desk, peonies in the vase, and the diploma is from
dialog: Yale.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Mr. Rexroth.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Rex, please.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and
dialog: consider this office your office,
dialog: your haven, your war room -- for the
dialog: duration of the campaign.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Now Rex.
text: He leans back in the leather executive chair behind his desk,
text: makes a steeple of his fingers, and dons his look of deepest
dialog: concern.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: -- Tell me your troubles.
text: Rex, nervous, laughs ruefully.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Jeez. Where do I start?
text: Miles gives an encouraging, rueful smile in return.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: ...Well, my wife has me between a
text: rock and a hard place.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That's her job. You have to respect
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: When I first met Marylin -- Well, we
dialog: were crazy about each other. Not
dialog: emotionally, of course. We just
dialog: couldn't keep our hands off each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: But then... But then...
text: Quietly.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Time marches on. Ardor cools.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly
dialog: cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And
dialog: very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of
dialog: it out there.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: You know what I mean when I say "it."
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Gotcha. No need to get anatomically
dialog: correct with me, Rex.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Seems like there's more of it than
dialog: ever before --
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, with the expanding global
dialog: population -- Let me ask you this --
dialog: your wife. Has she pursued the
dialog: opportunities which must present
dialog: themselves to the "knock-out, sexy
dialog: woman" you described?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: I don't know. I can assume...
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Not in court you can't. Has she
dialog: retained counsel?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And your wife is aware of or has
dialog: evidence of your activities?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Video.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Mmm... And to cut to the chase,
dialog: forensically speaking -- is there a
dialog: pre-nup?
text: Rex hangs his head.
text: Miles sighs sympathetically.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: The fault, dear Brutus, is not in
dialog: our stars, but in ourselves. Well,
dialog: let me ask you this: what kind of
dialog: settlement do you seek? What are,
dialog: for you, the parameters of the
dialog: possible?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: That's the problem. I can't afford
dialog: to give her anything.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Nothing?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: I know that sounds rough but I'm
dialog: about to close on a deal to develop
dialog: some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged
dialog: up to my ass. If this deal goes south,
dialog: I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: So, you propose that in spite of
dialog: demonstrable infidelity on your part,
dialog: your unoffending wife should be tossed
text: out on her ear?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Well -- is that possible?
text: Miles smiles at him.
scene_heading: EXT. RUNNING PATH - SAN VICENTE BLVD. - MORNING
text: Marylin power walks along the San Vicente Bike Path with her
text: friends SARAH SORKIN and RAMONA BARCELONA. It's early, but
text: the path is crowded with bikers, bladers, runners, power
text: walkers, wheelchair racers etc. Ramona pushes her infant in
text: a baby jogger.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You want to come out to the beach
dialog: house tomorrow?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Neither did I until my lawyer found
dialog: it -- quite a paper trail -- he had
text: it in the dog's name.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: (To Marylin)
dialog: So who'd you hire?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Ruth Rabino.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis
dialog: or a Pearlman? She definitely did a
dialog: Factor.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: She did a Harriman.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: In the words of my Private
dialog: Investigator, we're going to nail
dialog: his ass.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: I've been trying to nail George's
dialog: for years, but he's very careful.
dialog: I'll just keep having children. I
dialog: think I'm pregnant, by the way.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
text: Three is not Farrow.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Who's Rex's guy?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Miles Massey.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Of Massey Myerson?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Do you know him?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey
dialog: that cute little island of George's.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: George was so impressed he hired him
dialog: when he divorced his second.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Muriel Rumsey.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Who's she?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Now? She's a night manager at
dialog: McDonalds.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: You should have tried to get pregnant
dialog: Marylin -- solidify your position.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: You like kids.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I can't have a baby with a man I
dialog: don't love... And I can't submit a
dialog: child to divorce.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's not so bad these days. Kids
text: like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Maybe next time.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We do have a man for you.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just
text: separated from his third. He's in
text: fish. He is fish.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: She's keeping his name. And one of
dialog: his planes. And all seven of his
dialog: children
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: And only two are hers.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Please. I'm not seeing anyone until
text: this is over. One husband at a time.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I wish I had your discipline.
speaker_heading: A COURTROOM
text: We are close on the person on the witness stand, a woman in
dialog: her 60's.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: Mrs. Guttman, you have testified
dialog: that you were your husband's sexual
dialog: slave for thirty-six years, ever
dialog: since you were married --
speaker_heading: WITNESS
dialog: Except for two years when he was in
dialog: the Navy, in Korea.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: Prior to your marriage, what was
dialog: your profession?
speaker_heading: WITNESS
dialog: I was a hostess. For Trans-World
dialog: Airlines.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: What is your husband's profession?
speaker_heading: WITNESS
dialog: He manufactures staples and industrial
dialog: brad-tacks. He's very successful.
speaker_heading: JUMP BACK
text: At the counsel's table in the foreground Miles chats, voice
text: lowered with WRIGLEY, a boyish, bespectacled junior associate.
text: Beyond them we see the woman on the witness stand continuing
dialog: her testimony.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: Wait... He wants to give her...?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: And she has...?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Video.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: What the fuck...?
text: Miles turns to Wrigley with a look of indignation. He gestures
text: to their surroundings.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Wrigley!
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Sometimes I have serious doubts about
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: I am very sorry.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: No. You're not.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer
dialog: clerked for Scalia.
text: Wrigley looks suicidal.
scene_heading: BACKGROUND LAWYER (O.S.)
dialog: Couldn't you simply walk away from
dialog: this abusive relationship?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: No, he had the videos...
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Anyway, I need a challenge. This --
text: He waves dismissively at the courtroom.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: -- is not a challenge. I need
dialog: something I can sink my teeth into,
dialog: professionally speaking.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: He would invite these girls home
dialog: from the staple factory to our
dialog: condominium in Palm Springs. He had
text: a device he called the Intruder.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Mr. Massey! I ask again, if you have
dialog: any questions for the complainant.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'm sorry, your honor, I was just
dialog: conferring with my associate...
text: He rises.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Now then, Mrs. Guttman. Do you know
dialog: a gentleman named Morris Rudnick?
scene_heading: MRS. GUTTMAN
dialog: Well, yes, Morris is my accountant.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Accountant.
text: He reaches back and Wrigley puts a manila file in his hand.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: We would like to offer these
dialog: photographs into evidence...
scene_heading: WAITING ROOM - MASSEY MEYSERSON
text: The receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Marylin
text: and her attorney Ruth Rabinow. Ruth is a sturdy woman in her
dialog: late 60's. If Mrs. Guttman had gone to law school...
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Mr. Massey will see you now.
scene_heading: CONFERENCE ROOM
text: In the middle of the Massy Meyerson conference table is a
text: large fruit and pastry plate.
text: The door swings open. Miles rises.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: ...Ruth!
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: -- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth.
dialog: And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: And you must be Mr. Massey.
text: They appraise each other for a beat. They are impressed and,
text: they are impressive. As they settle in:
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: (Sadly)
dialog: Hello, Rex.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Marylin.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Are you alright? You lost weight.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: My whole metabolism is -- off.
text: Miles has been staring at Marylin. She notices this, and
text: smiles shyly. He snaps out of it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: So, Ruth. How's Sam?
speaker_heading: RUTH
text: Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly
dialog: fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: A yert.
dialog: (To Rex)
text: Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a
dialog: time when most women are in Boca,
dialog: having early bird specials -- she's
dialog: working so her husband can be in
dialog: Montana. In a yert.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: What's a yert?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (Dryly)
dialog: I ran into your mother at the
dialog: radiologist last week.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh, just a routine mammogram. She
dialog: said to say hello. She's going to
dialog: Positano with your brother's family.
text: A tight, terse smile from Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: How nice.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Positano is beautiful. Remember when
dialog: we were there, Rex? We stayed in the
dialog: Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Yeah.
text: They drift for a moment.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: So, Miles. If you have a proposal,
dialog: let's hear it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: At this point my client is still
text: prepared to consider reconciliation.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: My client has ruled that out.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: My client is prepared to entertain
dialog: an amicable dissolution of the
dialog: marriage without prejudice.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: That's delusional.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: My client proposes a thirty day
dialog: cooling off period.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: My client feels sufficiently
text: dispassionate.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: My client asks that you not initiate
dialog: proceedings pending his setting
dialog: certain affairs in order.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Ha Ha.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (conceding the point)
dialog: Heh heh.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: What's so goddamn funny?
text: Miles lays a hand on his arm.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Please -- let me handle this.
text: He puts the clipboard away and looks carefully at Ruth.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: -- So much for the icebreakers.
dialog: What're you after, Ruth?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: My client is prepared to settle for
dialog: fifty percent of the marital assets.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why
dialog: not ask for a hundred percent?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh brother. Here we go.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe
dialog: we're being too conservative. Seventy
dialog: five percent.
text: Rex winces. Rubs his stomach. Marylin leans forward and
text: whispers to him.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Do you need a Tagamet?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: You have some?
text: She removes a pack of the tablets from her purse, along with
text: several vials of prescription drugs.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: These are yours.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
text: She hands the pills to a grateful Rex. Their hands touch for
text: a moment.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Have you been taking your digestive
dialog: enzymes?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: (Contrite)
dialog: Sometimes I forget.
text: She looks at him like a concerned parent. Miles and Ruth
dialog: watch the interaction.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: (To the attorneys)
dialog: I'm sorry. Where were we?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: We were about to request the primary
dialog: residence, and thirty percent of the
dialog: remaining assets.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Are you familiar with Kirshner?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner
dialog: was in Kentucky.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: What's Kirshner?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Please -- let me handle this. Okay,
dialog: Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your
dialog: bottom line?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: The primary residence and FORTY
dialog: percent of the remaining assets.
dialog: You're becoming tedious Miles.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Aren't we going in the wrong
dialog: direction?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Shhh. Please. Let me do my job.
dialog: (To Ruth)
dialog: Buy a clue, Ruthie. Have you forgotten
dialog: about Kirshner?
text: Ruth stands and closes her attaché case.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: See you at the preliminary.
text: Miles calls to Ruth's retreating back.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Fine. We'll eat all the pastry.
text: Going through the door, Ruth doesn't react, but Marylin
text: following, glances back -- bemused, but with a trace of a
dialog: smile.
text: Rex swallows two more tablets. He sits, looking despondent.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I think that went as well as could
dialog: be expected.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: She always looked out for me.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And she had private investigators
text: assisting her.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: (Sentimental)
dialog: She brought my digestive enzymes.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: In anticipation of making you sick.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Maybe I should reconsider my...
text: Miles looks at him. Shakes his head, sadly.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: A superficial display of marital
dialog: solicitude, and you lose your resolve?
dialog: Rex. I underestimated you. But I'm
dialog: your attorney, and if you choose to
dialog: reward her for that mediocre charade
dialog: of spousal concern...
text: He shrugs, helplessly.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: You're right. Screw her.
scene_heading: INT. GYM - CLOSE ON
text: A woman walking across a gymnasium floor. Suddenly, she's
text: assaulted by a huge, grotesquely garbed assailant. His sweats
text: barely cover his massive, overdeveloped musculature. On his
text: head, a ski mask stretches over a padded football helmet. He
text: grabs the woman, yanks her back towards him. She reacts
text: swiftly. With a ferocious "NO," she stomps on his foot, and
text: smashes him in the face. The mugger raises his hands in a
text: gesture of submission.
speaker_heading: APPLAUSE
text: We pull back and see that we are in a Self Defense Class.
text: Two instructors, two "muggers" and ten women students all

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by
dialog: his intransigence. If I didn't know

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I have to admit. I was curious. And

speaker_heading: MAITRE D'
dialog: Something to start? Some wine,

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: French?

text: Miles nods at the maitre d' who returns the nod and withdraws.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I assume this is on Rex?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Isn't everything?
text: Miles regards her.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Your husband told me you were

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your
dialog: performance about this afternoon?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What does your lawyer think?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Ruth says you've been too successful,
dialog: that you're bored, complacent, and
dialog: you're on your way down.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: But you don't agree?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Why would you be here?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Risotto with white truffles, please.

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: You didn't ask me here to pick me

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Not really. You're not my client.
dialog: Freedom of association. Big issue

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: You just haven't met the right person.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No. I haven't. Have you?
text: She regards him for a moment.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: All right, Miles. Let me tell you
dialog: everything you THINK you know. I was
dialog: married to Rex for a long time. I
dialog: was an excellent wife, a partner, a
text: lover, a hostess and a friend. There
dialog: was only one thing I did wrong during
dialog: the five years we were together. I
dialog: got five years older. Think he should
dialog: be able to ditch me for that?
speaker_heading: MILES
text: He wants a reconciliation.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: See the tape. Then we can discuss
dialog: reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I
dialog: nailed his ass. Now I'm going to
dialog: have it mounted and have my
text: girlfriends over to throw darts at
dialog: it. Then I'm getting on with my life.
dialog: That's all I'm after.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Gotcha.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: What is it you're after, Miles?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: JUDGE

speaker_heading: MILES

text: Finally Miles, still pacing, declaims:
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: "Dismiss your vows, your feigned
dialog: tears, your flattery, for where a
dialog: heart is hard, they make no
dialog: battery..."
text: Marylin looks up from her handkerchief with a look of startled
text: irritation. Miles stops pacing and turns to face her with a
text: faint smile.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Do you know those lines, Mrs. Rexroth?
text: Marylin examines him with guarded eyes. Ruth sensing something
text: unscripted going on, tries to cut it off.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Objection, your honor!
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Grounds?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Uh... poetry recitation.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Let me rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, how
dialog: high is that wall around your heart?
text: Marylin eyes him suspiciously.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Your honor, this is harassment! Arid
dialog: frankly it's still a little...
text: She flutters one hand.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: ...arty farty!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you
dialog: ever been in love?
text: Marylin hesitates, gives a "what does this mean look" to
text: Ruth. She returns a "beats me."
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And you've always loved him?
text: Smiles slips out:
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at
dialog: first sight?"
text: Miles returns a fleeting smile.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And you hoped to spend the rest of
dialog: your life with him?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Yes. Why is that so difficult for
dialog: you to understand?
text: She looks at Rex with tender sorrow.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Rex was -- is -- a very appealing
dialog: man. I am sorry I couldn't...
dialog: (Tearing up)
dialog: I tried my best.
text: Miles almost smiles. She's good.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That'll be all Mrs. Rexroth. Please
dialog: forgive me for causing you additional

dialog: (To the Judge)
dialog: Thank you, Your Honor. No further

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Jesus.
text: An attractive woman in her mid fifties advances to be sworn.
dialog: She was a beauty, but her glory days are past and she's not
text: taking it well. She looks tense and slightly hypo-manic. She
text: speaks in a breathy, giggly voice, and smiles frequently for
dialog: no apparent reason.
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Mrs. Isenberg.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Banderas.
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Mrs. Banderas, do you solemnly swear
dialog: that the testimony you are about to
dialog: give shall be the truth, the whole
dialog: truth, and nothing but the truth so
dialog: help you God?
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Yes, Mr. Bailiff. I do.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your
dialog: relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: We don't have much of a relationship
dialog: anymore. I haven't seen her since
dialog: before she married Rex. We had some
dialog: very nice times prior to that. We
dialog: were quite close.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (To Marylin)
dialog: Is this a lover?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Please!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And how would you define your
dialog: relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You
dialog: know -- you are her...?
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Mother?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What?!
text: Marylin sighs.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Her Mother?
text: Patricia smiles coyly. Gives Marylin a silly little wave by
text: way of greeting.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Hi, Sweetie.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you
dialog: are frequently mistaken for sisters.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: (Mumbles)
dialog: He'll regret this.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: No. I haven't. But I've been out of
dialog: town.
dialog: (Little girlish wave)
dialog: Hello, Rex. Hello there.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You were never invited to meet your
dialog: son-in-law?
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm?
dialog: No. Well... no.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Objection, Your Honor. This isn't
dialog: about Mrs. Rexroth's filial
dialog: obligations.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Sustained.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Of course. Of course she was married.
dialog: What else would she be? Single? I
dialog: don't think so.
text: She laughs merrily at some private joke between her and her
dialog: psyche.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Let me tell you something about Patty.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Who's "Patty."
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like
dialog: mine. I was Pat and she was Patty.
dialog: But she changed it after seeing "Some
dialog: Like It Hot." To Marylin. After
dialog: Marylin Monroe.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I see. And what were you going to
dialog: tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: When she was a tiny girl? And people
dialog: asked her what she wanted to be when
dialog: she grew up? She never said the usual
dialog: things little girls say -- like --
dialog: nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman?
dialog: She always said --
dialog: (Very Shirley Temple)
dialog: "When I grow up, I want to be
dialog: divorced."
text: She laughs happily at the memory.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Well, not just divorce. She used to
dialog: say "I want to be divorced from some
dialog: big dumb rich guy..." And I guess
text: her dream is coming true.
dialog: (To Marylin)
dialog: I'm happy for you Patty
scene_heading: INT. SARAH SORKIN'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: It was like that scene in The
dialog: Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is
dialog: called to testify against the Family.
text: And he's in court, and he looks into
text: the spectators gallery, and sees his
dialog: Brother. They brought the brother
dialog: from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a
dialog: word. He can't testify. That's what
dialog: it was like seeing Pat in there. I
dialog: couldn't even have Ruth cross examine
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Why do you think she did it?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: (Shrugs)
dialog: Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA.
dialog: Maybe they offered her money. Massey
dialog: is very seductive. Who knows.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Maybe they put a horse head in her
dialog: bed?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That stinks. They left you with
dialog: absolutely nothing. It makes you
dialog: wonder about the entire legal system.
dialog: Like Rodney King.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: They bought her speech. If I was
dialog: only in it for Rex's money, he
dialog: shouldn't have to give me any.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
text: That doesn't make sense. It's like
dialog: punishing you for being goal oriented.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Well, you can live here as long as
dialog: you want. Do you have any plans?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Nothing specific, but I'll have my
dialog: own place soon.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So, Marylin. Is that what you said
dialog: when you were a little girl?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Probably. Every woman in my life was
dialog: divorced at least twice. What was I
dialog: supposed to say. Anthropologist?
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: I begged you to have a baby!

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: KENNETH

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (To Miles)
dialog: Here. Got pictures.
text: He removes a family photo from the felt wallet. It's of Howard
text: and two fat teenagers. Apparently the former Mrs. Doyle was
text: cut out, but an ear and part of a hairdo are sill visible in
dialog: the shot.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I... uh guess congratulations are in
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
text: Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up
dialog: and...
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Honey, I don't think this is really
dialog: relevant to...
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: ...and one day, this sweet girl calls
dialog: me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder
dialog: to cry on deal. One thing leads to
dialog: another and before I know it --
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: -- we realized we'd always been very
text: attracted to one another.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I had no idea until after, but --
text: He looks at her with predatory lust.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Baby. You are so HOT!
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: (Coy)
dialog: Howard!
text: He pulls her close to him and plants a massive kiss on her.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What a touching story.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You know, Miles, after my wife --
dialog: wife's mastectomy -- things were
dialog: never the same. This might sound
dialog: cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey,
dialog: but...
dialog: (man to man)
dialog: I like my women with two boobs.
text: Miles flashes Marylin a "you are KIDDING" look, but she
text: assiduously avoids eye contact.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Howard and I are here, Miles, because
dialog: I have learned through bitter
dialog: experience that when it comes to
dialog: matrimonial law, you are the very
dialog: best.
text: Miles acknowledges this with a curt nod.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: As you are well aware, my previous
dialog: marriage ended with an unjustified
dialog: strain on my reputation My motives
dialog: were questioned. I was slandered in
dialog: court.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You did good, Massey!
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Therefore in an effort to remove any
dialog: trace of suspicion from my sweet
dialog: Howard -- I wish to execute a pre-
dialog: nuptial agreement.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: And -- there's no talking her out of
dialog: it. Believe me, I've tried.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: They say the Massey pre-nup has never
dialog: been penetrated.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
text: He gropes her. She giggles like a teenager.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh, for the love of...
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: That is true, isn't it Miles? Your
dialog: pre-nup is the best there is?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That is correct. Not to blow my own
dialog: horn, but they devote an entire
dialog: semester to it at Harvard Law.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I just want to make sure that you
dialog: both --
text: He eyes Marylin.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: -- understand what you're asking for
dialog: here. The Massey pre-nup provides
dialog: that in the event of a dissolution
dialog: of the marriage for any reason, both
dialog: parties shall leave it with whatever
dialog: they brought in, and earned during.
dialog: No one can profit from the marriage.
dialog: The pre-nup protects the wealthier
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And without it, that party is exposed --
text: a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put
dialog: that in the Malibu house. Screw the
dialog: screening room!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (slightly sickened)
dialog: -- and we are sure...
text: Eyes boring into Marylin.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: -- we are both sure that's what we
dialog: want?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Course I can't do much "wriggling"
dialog: if you tie me up like that again.
dialog: Massey -- this is one bad bad little
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: We'd better go before we get thrown
dialog: out.
scene_heading: ELEVATOR BANK
text: Marylin and Howard wait for an elevator as Miles trots out
dialog: to catch them.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could
dialog: just borrow your charming fiancee
text: for a moment.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What part?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'd just like to have a word with
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Why not? I'm going to have her for a
dialog: lifetime.
text: Miles drags her to the side as Doyle checks his Sports Pager.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What are you doing?
text: She backs up as he tries to close the space between them.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Getting married.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: To him? He's a sick freak.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
text: He's passionate.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Passionate! He's a pervert. He should
dialog: have to register when he moves.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: All girls enjoy a little rough trade
dialog: from time to time.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Marylin! Listen to me.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: No. You listen to me.
dialog: (Very quiet and
dialog: deliberate)
dialog: You busted me, Miles. You left me
dialog: with nothing! What did you expect me
dialog: to do? Get a degree in counseling?
dialog: Write a book about table linen?
dialog: Because that's what wives do when
dialog: they get dumped, and frankly, I'm
text: not quite ready for that.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: But why him?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: We told you. We realized we've always
dialog: been in love.
text: He has backed her against the wall of an alcove which shelters
text: a flowering ficus.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: The Massey pre-nup has never been
dialog: pene -- successfully challenged.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: So I hear. Is that all?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No, that's not all.
text: He moves to kiss her.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You fascinate me.
text: She deftly slides out of the way. Miles watches her as she
text: heads down the hall. As she gets on the elevator, Howard
text: grabs her butt with one hand, while giving Miles a high sign
text: with the other.
scene_heading: INT. HOWARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Miles stares at the chessboard.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Do you think I'm going to end up
text: like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy
dialog: bag instead of a family?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Got any symptoms?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yes. The inability to experience
dialog: pleasure.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Oh. That.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Don't waste time with your queen.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: The Center Counter Defense. The thing
dialog: is not to move your queen too early.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: She can't really love that idiot,
dialog: can she?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Marylin Rexroth. She came into my
dialog: office and signed a pre-nup with
dialog: Howard Doyle.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Doyle Oil?
dialog: (Miles nods)
dialog: A Massey Pre-nup?
dialog: (Miles nods again)
dialog: She loves him.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: He's the wrong man.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Miles! Don't waste time with someone
dialog: else's queen, either.
scene_heading: EXT. A WEDDING BOWER - AKA CHUPPA

speaker_heading: BOLENSKY
dialog: Parsley sage, rosemary and thyme --
dialog: Remember me to one who lives there...
text: A pullback reveals Howard D. Doyle before the altar with
text: Marylin. He is in a tuxedo and yarmulke. She is dressed in a
text: simple, Kennedy-type gown.
speaker_heading: BOLENSKY
dialog: -- she once was a true love of mine.
text: The last arpeggiated chord rings out; birds tweet, everyone
dialog: sits.
text: As Miles and Wrigley seat themselves, Wrigley is sniffling.
text: Miles is irritated.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What the hell is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: I can't help it. Even with the
dialog: business we're in, I -- it gets me
dialog: every time. It's so -- optimistic.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Is she going through with it?
text: As the crowd quiets with the end of the song, Wrigley murmurs:
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: If she's not going through with it,
dialog: she's cutting it awful close.
scene_heading: RABBI BOLENSKY
text: Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme.
dialog: Ingredients. Spices. Spicy ingredients
dialog: for the banquet we call -- life.
dialog: Marriage is like a Great Feast.
text: Courtship is the Appetizer. A small
text: mixed green taste of things to come.
dialog: The Early Years -- The First Course --
text: a carefully poached fish dish
dialog: dependent on freshness and delicate
text: handling. Or perhaps a light pasta --
text: a tortellini stuffed with cheese and
dialog: hope.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: (Whispers, to Miles)
dialog: You have any gum or mints?
speaker_heading: RABBI
dialog: The main course -- Mature Love -- a
text: hearty stew, cooked slowly in the
dialog: oven of companionship until the meat
text: falls off the bone. And then --
dialog: dessert. The reward for years spent
dialog: together -- the sweetness of a Life
dialog: Well Lived. A sorbet of grandchildren,
text: followed by the decafe demitasse of
dialog: retirement.
text: There is silence, broken only by the twitter of birds and
text: the restlessness of a hungry audience.
dialog: Finally:
scene_heading: RABBI BOLENKSY
dialog: Do you Chaim David Doyle, take Marylin
dialog: to be the Barbara to your Wolfgang
dialog: though the lean years as well as
dialog: those that are heavily marbled?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I do.
scene_heading: RABBI BOLENSKY
dialog: And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take
dialog: Chaim to be the roux in your bechamel?

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Argh.

speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What are they?
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
text: Berry spoons.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm
dialog: surprised at you. What is this? Some
dialog: Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are
dialog: the most cockamamie things I've ever --
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: Miles -- why so angry?
text: Miles sounds wistful:
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Why couldn't we be the club sandwich?
text: Ding Ding -- Howard D. is tapping a knife against his wine
text: glass. The crowd quiets.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls:
dialog: I have something to say to my bride.
text: Howard D. turns to one side to address Marylin, taking one
text: of her hands between his paws, as she beams up at him.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: -- Darling, like the rabbi said...
dialog: life is a banquet, A Grand Bouffe,
dialog: and Marylin, darling... I just want
dialog: you to know that I am IN the kitchen
dialog: and I CAN STAND THE HEAT!
text: Laughter from the gallery.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: And I'm going to start this marriage
text: by EATING MY WORDS. Because the hot
dialog: hors d'oerve of this love story is --
dialog: Pre-nup Primavera!
text: He reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a piece of
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Carmine! Bring on the Pesto!
text: A Caterer places a plate and a bowl of sauce in front of
text: Doyle. Marylin looks on, surprised and bemused.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: -- This is for you, darling.
text: He starts tearing strips off the piece of paper, dipping
text: them into the sauce, and eating them. His mouth stuffed with
dialog: paper, Doyle repeats:
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: -- this is for you, Darling.
text: The crowd is murmuring--the murmurs grow in volume -- a
text: smattering of applause -- cheers -- more applause -- wild
text: cheers. Slowly rhythmically, Miles starts thumping his hand
text: together, nodding comprehension.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Brilliant.
text: Next to him Wrigley is puzzled.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: Why is he doing that?
text: Miles' hand-clapping accelerates.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Brilliant. It's brilliant. He's eating
dialog: the pre-nup.
text: Wrigley's eyes widen. He looks back at Doyle eating the paper.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: This is for you, Darling!
text: Wrigley bursts into tears.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: That's -- the most romantic thing
dialog: I've ever seen -- in my LIFE!
speaker_heading: DOYLE
text: THIS IS FOR YOU, DARLING!
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Marylin stands at the punch bowl accepting congratulations.
text: Miles approaches and draws her aside.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'd like to offer my congratulations.
dialog: That was a beautiful gesture of
dialog: Howard's.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Howard is a beautiful person.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yes. He's a diamond in the rough.
dialog: And I have a feeling that someday
dialog: soon you'll be taking that diamond
dialog: and leaving the rough.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
text: Miles. Miles. Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I am thrilled for you, but tell me
dialog: this... How'd you get Howard to do
dialog: it? I've addressed enough juries to
dialog: appreciate the power of suggestion,
dialog: but it seemed like he thought it was
dialog: his own idea.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: It was his idea. It was a gesture of
dialog: love and trust. Be happy for me,
dialog: Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, when this goes south -- promise
dialog: you'll have dinner with me?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
text: (She holds a plate of
dialog: food for him)
dialog: Have you tried the duck?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I figure a couple of months. That's
dialog: how long it should take for the ink
text: on the settlement to dry.
text: He takes the plate of food from her.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: It has bones. Be sure to swallow
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Although knowing you as I do -- there
dialog: will be no settlement. This time it
dialog: will be complete and total
dialog: annihilation.

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No. Just to comfort you, and

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: (Reproachfully)
dialog: You really think I engineered the

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I just cried when I got home. Somehow,
dialog: your disdain for me -- I'm pretty
dialog: tough Miles, but I'm human. All my
dialog: life people have been ascribing these

dialog: think they were jealous, or they
dialog: didn't understand, but... I dunno.
dialog: Maybe others see something in me.
dialog: Something I'm not even aware of.
dialog: Anyway, thank you for letting me

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: You have wonderful art. I love that

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No. She loved me. She would never
dialog: not love her son. She just didn't...
dialog: I wasn't her "type." She said I was
dialog: a very, colicky baby. You know?
dialog: Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't
dialog: eat well? We got off to a bad start,
dialog: and she never seemed to recoup --
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: She held that against you?
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Apparently she was very disappointed.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Boy. Boy, oh boy.
text: Marylin looks at the picture again. And yes -- you can see
text: how hesitant Miles was. Marylin is moved. A flash of something
text: genuine crosses her face.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: And here I thought my mother was...
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Your mother was.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Oh right. You met Patricia.

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No, we're not!
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: We are, Miles. You know I'm right.
dialog: There's something "off" about you
dialog: and me Miles. And maybe it isn't
dialog: because of these women -- maybe they
dialog: were just extremely insightful and
dialog: recognized our "deficiencies" very
dialog: early on. Maybe...
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch
dialog: and yours is a psycho. I can't believe
dialog: you're saying this, Marylin! There's
dialog: nothing wrong with us. We're
text: attractive and charismatic and
dialog: successful and... I like us.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen
dialog: to me. I'm sure you have a very
dialog: fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Friends?
speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: And I'm not used to -- Marylin --

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: What is it Miles?
speaker_heading: MILES

text: She waits, puzzled.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I want to be your -- your wife.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No... That wasn't right. I want YOU
dialog: to be MY wife.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Did you just propose to me?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yes. I am. What else could those
dialog: words mean? I believe we belong
dialog: together and we can make one another
dialog: happy. And we should be happy because
dialog: happiness is better than the
dialog: alternative which is -- just jump in
dialog: any old time, Marylin. You have more
dialog: experience at this than I do.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Yes, Miles. I accept.
speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I have it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You have the pre-nup?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: No. I have the ring. Was I supposed
dialog: to have a pre-nup?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No. You have the ring. Wrigley has

speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Oh. I thought maybe --

dialog: Gee!

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: KENNETH

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You know each other? Of course you

speaker_heading: RAMONA

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hello Miles.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Congratulations Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hi. Hello.
dialog: (To Marylin)
dialog: Marylin. You know my young associate,
text: Wrigley.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I do. He was at my divorce and my
dialog: wedding. What would a marital related
dialog: event be without Wrigley?
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: It has become a tradition, hasn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I loved the berry spoons.
dialog: (Wrigley beams)
dialog: I didn't have any. Thank you.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, Wrigley brought something else
dialog: for you today, darling.
text: Wrigley pulls a sheaf of papers from the briefcase.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: This -- is the Massey Pre-nup.
text: Wrigley hastily pulls a ballpoint from his pocket and clicks
text: it. Miles grabs the pre-nup, and as he turns to Marylin, his
text: tone softens.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Marylin, you're welcome to examine
dialog: it, but as you know -- it's iron
text: clad.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It is. It's famous.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't
dialog: get her.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: We wanted Ruth here for your
dialog: protection as well --
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: The Judge is here. Over here, Judge
dialog: Munson.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce
dialog: hearing?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yes. Short notice you know, but I
dialog: think there's nice closure to it.
dialog: Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as
dialog: always.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MUNSON
dialog: What's up with you two.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: We're getting married.
text: Judge laughs.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MUNSON
dialog: What's the gag?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: A gag? No.
text: Marylin looks at the pre-nup. Then pulls Miles aside.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Excuse me, Judge Muson.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You got it, Patty.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: (To Miles)
dialog: You brought a pre-nup to our wedding?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (She isn't having the
dialog: expected reaction)
dialog: It's for your protection, sweetheart.
dialog: You're the one with the -- the...
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: -- the coin?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Miles. I don't want to sign this. I
dialog: want this marriage to be different.
dialog: Okay. Judge Munsen and Wrigley are
dialog: here, but other than that...
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Should I go out for a smoke?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin,
dialog: if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit
dialog: from the marriage.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: (Sadly)
dialog: Oh Miles!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What I mean is, your wealth is
dialog: completely protected.
text: As if a lead veil had been drawn across. She looks deep into
text: his eyes. Into his soul.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Miles. Listen to me. You are about
dialog: to become my husband. I don't want
dialog: to be protected from you. I want to
dialog: be protected for you.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: (Moved)
dialog: Ohhh...
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: But?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I want this to be a marriage based
dialog: on love, trust and community property.
dialog: That's all I've ever wanted.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: But Marylin, without this, you're
text: completely exposed.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I want to be exposed.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: You're vulnerable.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: It's about time.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You're a sitting duck.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: (To Miles, with great

scene_heading: INT. MASSEY HOUSE - MORNING
text: Miles and Marylin asleep in bed. The ALARM RINGS. Miles wakes,
text: turns to his beautiful wife -- kisses her good morning.
text: She gives him a sleepy Smile.
text: Miles dressing for work. Marylin, in a Sabia Rosa bathrobe
text: places a tray with coffee next to him. He holds up two ties
text: for her-approval. She selects one. He puts it on.
text: Miles and Marylin reading Newspapers while eating breakfast.
text: She serves him a bowl of fruit and indicates Wrigley's berry
text: spoons. They laugh heartily.
text: Marylin waves good bye as Miles backs drives to the office.
text: She waves at the gardeners who blow palm fronds around the

scene_heading: MILES OFFICE
text: He has managed to fill his credenza with pictures of married
text: life. Due to its brevity -- these pictures are uneventful,
text: the Massey's wear the same outfit in most of them.
text: Miles works. He is interrupted by the voice of his SECRETARY.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: I have Mrs. Massey on line one for
dialog: you.
text: Miles picks up.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Mom...?
text: He laughs and laughs. We hear Marylin's laughter coming
text: through the receiver.
text: Miles exits a flower store with a bouquet of tulips. Marylin
text: at the doorway, greets Miles as he arrives home.
text: As Miles changes into his casual after work outfit, (khakis?)
text: Marylin sits at the edge of the bed. He's telling her about
text: his day, and she is rapt with attention.
text: The Massey's have a candlelit dinner of fish and pasta. The
text: tulips are in the middle of the table.
text: Miles and Marylin snuggle on a couch and watch Seinfeld.
text: Miles in bed on the new Frette Linen. A few too many pillows,
text: but he's making it work. Marylin enters the bedroom in a
text: nightshirt that is the perfect combination of innocence and

dialog: him.

scene_heading: CLICK - LIGHTS OUT
scene_heading: EXT. MASSEY MYERSON - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Miles is addressing the young associates.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: For the first time in my life, I
dialog: stand before you naked...
text: vulnerable... and in love. Love. A
text: word matrimonial lawyers shy away
dialog: from. Ironic isn't it -- that I have
dialog: been frightened of this emotion which
dialog: is, in a sense, the seed of my
dialog: livelihood. But today, I am here to
dialog: tell you: Love should cause us no
dialog: fear. Love should cause us no shame.
dialog: Love... is good.
dialog: (He lets it sink in)
dialog: Let me ask you a question. When our
text: clients come to us confused, angry,
dialog: hurting because their flame of love
text: is fluttering and threatens to die --
dialog: should we seek to extinguish that
dialog: flame, so that we can sift through
text: the smoldering wreckage for our paltry
dialog: reward? Or should we seek to fan
dialog: this precious flame -- this most
dialog: precious flame -- back to loving,
dialog: roaring life?
text: The young associates look confused. Wrigley raises his hand.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: Extinguish?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Should we counsel fear -- or trust?
dialog: Should we seek to destroy -- or to
dialog: build? Should we meet our clients'
dialog: problems with cynicism -- or with
dialog: love?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (another raised hand)
dialog: Kramer?
speaker_heading: KRAMER
dialog: Build?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: The decision of course, is each of
dialog: ours. For my part, I have made the
dialog: leap of love, and there is no going
dialog: back --
text: Herb Myserson sits in the back of the room. He watches,
text: breathing heavily.
scene_heading: INT. DEN - MASSEY HOUSE
text: Miles and Marylin watching a cable movie crowded together on
text: the small sofa.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll
dialog: move to the...
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No. Stay. I want you close to me.
dialog: This couch is wrong. It's not a
dialog: "married couch."
text: He surveys his surroundings with a critical eye.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Honey, I could sit...
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: In fact, this is not a married house --
dialog: it's a bachelor pad.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Hardly. You have six bedrooms
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I know. But I've converted most of
dialog: them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms --
text: a billiard room, a card room, a gym --
dialog: Honey, want you to go out, as soon
dialog: as you feel up to it -- and buy
dialog: married things. Woman things.
dialog: Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make
dialog: this your house.
text: He hands her a credit card.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Here's my card. Spend as much as you
dialog: want. We get mileage.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Well, I suppose I could "girly" it
dialog: up for you with a little Fortuny,
dialog: and some passementerie --
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Good.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Are those foods?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
text: Fabric and fringe.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not
dialog: right away -- There's a room right
dialog: off the bedroom -- It would be perfect
dialog: for a nursery.
dialog: (He takes her hands)
dialog: It's a walk in humidor right now --
dialog: but if I took out the refrigeration
dialog: unit --
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I think a nursery should be right
dialog: off the master suite. My parents put
text: mine in the guest house. Apparently
text: they did have a Fisher Price intercom,

speaker_heading: SARAH
text: It's not Ming. It's Tong.
speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Is Tong older than Ming?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I think Ming is older than Tong.

speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: That is a Chinese Prayer Bowl. It's

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Ok. I'll take it.

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

speaker_heading: MARYLIN

dialog: Well. He said to "make the house

speaker_heading: RAMONA
dialog: Oh boy. If he only knew.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Yeah. I guess. You know --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: He's not what I expected. He's very --
dialog: he's so -- happy.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: But you're going through with it?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've
dialog: never been the first wife. Rex was
dialog: married before me.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
text: Miles is different. He's still so
dialog: idealistic.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Well, that's about to change big
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: He has no cynicism or anger. For
dialog: once I'm not the repository of rage

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Soon, you'll have your own rage!
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I guess.
scene_heading: INT. FLOWER STORE - EVENING

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You're Miles Massey! You probably

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You ruined my life you sonofabitch.
dialog: Gimme those.

speaker_heading: NURSE

speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I'm sorry, Sir. Emily. Give the man

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: He tricked you. With a phony wife
text: and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He
dialog: got you. You married Marylin, didn't
dialog: you? You thought she had money. HA
dialog: HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think
dialog: that because of what you did to me.
dialog: And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Marylin was friends with Howard and

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I have no idea what Howard Doyle

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You used his credit card.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: He told me to -- he said he wanted
dialog: me to --
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Quite a little shopping spree. How
dialog: do you spend six figures in less
dialog: than six hours? Oh, never mind I've
dialog: seen it before. I've seen everything.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Do you think he set me up? Do you
dialog: think that was his intention?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Like I know his intention? Or yours
dialog: for that matter?
dialog: (Sighs)
dialog: I should join Sam. I'm too old for
dialog: this bullshit.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: He never even asked. He just assumed --
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: He was right, wasn't he?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: So. Now what?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a

scene_heading: INT. MASSEY HOUSE - DAY
text: Miles opens the door. Marylin is standing there.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: May I come in?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I don't know. Maybe I should grab my
dialog: mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have
dialog: little experience with "the criminal
dialog: mind."
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I'd just like to pick up a few of my
dialog: things
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I don't believe you have "things."
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: On the contrary. We're married and
dialog: we have no pre-nup, so a case could
dialog: be made that everything in here is
dialog: mine.
text: Marylin walks into the den. Sits on the new sofa.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Comfy!
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I want to nail you ass.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Are you threatening me, because I'm
dialog: sure that's a violation of the terms
dialog: of your bail.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I'm reporting you to the IRS.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting
dialog: a refund.
text: He laughs. She looks at him, dead serious.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported
dialog: every dollar I've ever made. Try
text: again, girlfriend.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I'm not talking about dollars,
dialog: studmuffin. I'm talking about --
text: She opens a humidor and takes out a Cigar.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
speaker_heading: STUFF.
dialog: (Chomping on the Cigar)
dialog: Got a light?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What kind of "stuff?"
text: She reaches into her purse. Pulls out a Dunhill and expertly
text: lights the cigar.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Arty Farty stuff.
dialog: (Pointing to the
dialog: Hockney)
dialog: Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans.
text: Watches and mileage on private jets.
dialog: Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from
dialog: grateful clients.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Those are gifts.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Salary. Unreported income.
text: (Glancing at his watch)
dialog: By the way, what time IS it on
dialog: Bellagio Road?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You can't prove anything.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I don't have to. That's what the IRS
dialog: guys do. And they do it with great
dialog: zeal. See, they work at these tortuous
dialog: civil service jobs, and when five
dialog: hundred dollar an hour boys like you
dialog: take their trade out in luxury
dialog: goodies, these saps feel.. well,

text: they feel WRATH.
dialog: (Puffing on the cigar)
dialog: What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You're out of your league, Marylin.
dialog: Rexroth was a primate. I'm a
dialog: professional.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I know. So am I, right? And so is
dialog: Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue
dialog: Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid
dialog: graduate of Southwestern University --
dialog: very tenacious, and never more so
dialog: than when he's dealing with an
dialog: unscrupulous colleague.
dialog: (She stands to leave)
dialog: I think it's only fair to warn you:
dialog: I'm going to file an action, Miles.
dialog: And after a decent interval I plan
dialog: to have Ruth seek an injunction that
dialog: will forbid your approach within 500
text: feet of my house.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Meaning my house.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I believe the residence will be part
dialog: of the settlement.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Did our marriage ever mean anything
dialog: to you?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Drop the bogus forgery charge and
dialog: I'll forget about your generous
dialog: friends slash clients.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That's blackmail.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: That's marriage.
text: She gives him a peck on the cheek. As she leaves:
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: You'll always be my favorite husband.
text: Miles sits dejectedly on the new sofa looking at the

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Pity you can't be here. You'd enjoy

speaker_heading: HERB
dialog: Lost! I'll tell you what you can do,

speaker_heading: HERB

text: An edgy looking gangster, JOE. He is perspiring heavily. He

text: His labored breath rattles as he stares across the table at
text: someone off. At length, a voice:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: ...Are you Joe?
text: Still staring, but perhaps by way of answer, the gangster
text: raises an inhaler, sticks it in his mouth, and squeezes.
speaker_heading: WHUSH.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER
dialog: ...Dumbarton?
text: A reverse shows Miles seated across a small round table in a
text: seedy low-lit clam house. Photos of Ted Kennedy and the Pope
text: adorn the walls..
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton,
dialog: on a... matter of some delicacy.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER
dialog: Who's the pigeon?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: GANGSTER
dialog: Who do you want me to kill?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr.
dialog: Dumbarton -- would like you to uh,
dialog: neutralize a, uh, business associate
dialog: by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle
dialog: Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER
dialog: Is that... one person?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Here's her picture...
text: He is shoving an envelope across the table.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: ...and the address where she's
dialog: staying. It's the residence of a Mr.
dialog: Massey. Uh, Dumbarton. Massey. Uh,
text: it's not Mr. Dumbarton's house. Though
dialog: he's not involved. And because of an
dialog: impending legal action this needs to
dialog: happen within a certain... time frame.
dialog: Uh... on an expedited basis.
text: The gangster stares expressionlessly. He raises the inhaler
text: again and, with his eyes still on Miles, squeezes. WHUSH.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER
dialog: You're in a rush.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
text: A long beat. Finally, Miles explodes
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: She won't suffer, will she?
text: He bites a knuckle, gazing fearfully at the gangster. The
text: gangster stares impassively back.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER
dialog: ...not unless you pay extra.
scene_heading: INT. REX REXROTH MANSION
text: An enormous oak paneled room. Furnished with chairs sofas

scene_heading: INT. KENNETH'S HOUSE
text: A guest room. Dark, dirty and filled with empty bottles of
dialog: expensive French wine.
text: We hear a phone ringing in a different room. It rings several
dialog: times.
text: The figure on the bed stirs, rolls over, moans, clamps a
text: pillow over his head.
text: The ring of the distant telephone is interrupted and we hear
text: a muffled voice:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hello. Yes, he's here. Just a minute --
text: We hear approaching footsteps and Kenneth enters the
text: background, knotting a bathrobe. He turns on the light in
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Miles. It's for you.
text: The figure on the couch pulls away the pillow. It is indeed
text: Miles Massey. He blearily takes the offered phone.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hello. Yes -- what?! Yes -- I see --
text: After another listening beat he drops the phone away. He
text: remains staring dully out into space.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: My God.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That was Marvin Untermeyer.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: He was Rex Rexroth's personal
dialog: attorney.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: What do you mean, was.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Rex just had a massive coronary. In
text: the middle of a business meeting.
text: He's dead.
text: Kenneth is mildly puzzled.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that. But you
dialog: weren't close, were you?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Marvin says that Rex's will is four
text: years old. He never redrafted it.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Yes.
text: Miles voice is still flat, expressionless:
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Everything goes to Marylin.
text: He looks up a at Kenneth.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: She's rich. We're still married. We
dialog: have no pre-nup.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: So, that's good, right?
speaker_heading: MINUTES LATER
text: Miles paces with the telephone. He punches numbers with the
text: thumb of the hand holding the phone; his other hand holds a
text: coffee cup from which he takes trembling slurps.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: This is Joe. Wuddya need?
text: Then a beep.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Joe. This is Mr. uh... friend of --
dialog: we met. This is to instruct you it's

dialog: on Marylin Rexroth Doyle -- No Go.
text: He slams down the phone.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: That was -- oh, shit. What if he's
dialog: on his way over there?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Huh?
text: Consumed with remorse, Miles moans.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Marylin! What have I done?
speaker_heading: KENNETH

scene_heading: INT. MASSEY MANSION - NIGHT
text: In the bedroom, the phone starts ringing. A hand enters to

speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: MILES SPEEDING CAR
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Marylin?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Miles? Miles! Where have you been?
dialog: I've been trying to get in touch.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You have to leave the house
dialog: immediately!
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I will, Miles. I will leave. But
dialog: Miles --
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No buts. Now. Out.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles.
dialog: It's true that my initial intention
dialog: was to...
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Please! Leave the house.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I fell in love Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: So did I. Now pack up a few basics
dialog: and --
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: You do? You do love me?
scene_heading: MASSEY MANSION
text: Marylin hangs up the phone.
text: She walks slowly around the room, pausing at the mantelpiece
text: to pick up a framed picture of Miles, which she
text: contemplatively regards.
text: We pan with her continued walk to bring Joe into frame. He
text: stands with his back pressed to the wall. She's started for
text: a moment, but quickly recoups:
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Mr. Dumbarton.
text: She shows him the picture of Miles.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No...
text: She cocks an eye at him.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's his lawyer.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Triple!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who's the pigeon?
text: We faintly hear a car screeching to a halt.
scene_heading: EXT. MASSEY MANSION
text: Massey exits the car. He clutches a can of mace.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION
text: We hear a key scrape in the lock. The front door swings open
text: onto a dark foyer as Miles tiptoes in.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (Whispers)
dialog: Marylin?
scene_heading: DINING ROOM
text: Miles tiptoes through, looking warily about. He backs through
text: the swinging doors connecting to the kitchen. Finds himself
text: face to face with Joe.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Joe! Thank God you're in time. You're
dialog: not in time. I'm in time. Thank God
dialog: I'm in time.
text: Joe stares at him.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: It's a no go! Get it? No one any the
dialog: wiser. Okay!
text: He makes a cow-herding motion with his hands.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You can go home now! Goodbye! Thanks
dialog: so much!
text: Joe takes out his gun.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No no! No contract! It's all over.
text: This has no effect on Joe who is unscrewing his silencer.
text: Miles is exasperated. Suddenly -- Marylin appears.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: It's a no go, Joe.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Marylin!
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: It's okay Joe.
text: Joe glances at both of them with barely concealed contempt.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Wait! He works for YOU?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Now. But first, he worked for you.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You were going to have this thug...?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Wait just a second there. You sent
dialog: him here. You unearthed this
text: pestilence.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're calling me a pestilence? That's
dialog: a hoot!
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: (To Joe)
dialog: I'm sorry. That was unkind and --
dialog: but, we changed our minds.
dialog: (To Miles)
dialog: Did you really mean what you said on
dialog: the phone. It wasn't because you
dialog: found out about Rex?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband.
dialog: I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No
dialog: matter what happened to you.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: That's true.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Lemme tell you something. You are
dialog: the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay
dialog: you the twenty thousand.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: It was fifty for you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (To Miles)
dialog: That's cause you're a lawyer. I gave
dialog: her the lawyer discount.
dialog: (Looks at Marylin)
dialog: But I shouldn't of. Cause you're a
text: whore. A whore who worships the
dialog: dollar.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Well, actually, all whores worship
dialog: the dollar, if you want to get
dialog: technical.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like
dialog: you. And my clients? Whores just
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Were you with a firm?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Kaplan.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Kaplan? I know Kaplan. Wait. You're
dialog: Joe Gittelson? I knew you looked --
dialog: You were great -- we studied you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Twenty years in "matrimonial law"
dialog: and it made me sick.
dialog: (He wheezes)
dialog: I broke up homes and families, never
dialog: givin' it a second thought. Till one
dialog: day. I had an epiphany. You know
dialog: what that is?
dialog: (They nod)
dialog: Came with a damn stigmata if you can
dialog: believe that! I said to myself --
dialog: Joe -- everyone you see wants blood.
dialog: Everyone wants their ex's dead. So
dialog: why jerk around with rest. You wanna
dialog: best serve your clients? Kill em.
text: Joe is raising the gun at Miles. Miles sprays him with Mace.
text: BANG -- Joe fires blindly, scrunching his eyes against the
text: chemical, sucking for breath like a jet engine revving for a
dialog: take-off.
text: SLAM -- Marylin elbows him in the face, breaking his nose.
text: She finishes with a solid groin kick. It slows him down, but
text: doesn't stop him.
text: Joe stumbles a bit, but regains his footing.
text: BANG -- Joe is rampaging around the room, still firing,
text: thumping at his chest with his free hand for his inhaler.
text: Marylin runs to Miles. He takes her hand and they run toward
text: the door, seeking egress.
text: BANG -- still firing, he pulls out the inhaler but blindly
text: bobbles it.
text: Joe reaches with his gun hand to keep the inhaler from
text: falling. He momentarily bobbles both gun and inhaler.
text: Miles pops up in front of him.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I'm not leaving you. I took self
dialog: defense
text: Joe recovers and raises the gun to his mouth as he points
text: the inhaler at Miles.
text: He squeezes -- WHUSH -- Miles squints against the asthma
text: mist and lets out a horrified:
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Joe!
text: BANG! The off-screen gunshot is followed by the sound of a
text: body dropping heavily to the floor.
dialog: Silence.
text: Marylin runs over to Miles. They look sadly down at the floor.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: WE told him it was no go...
scene_heading: INT. MASSEY MYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Wrigley sits bouncing the steepled fingers of one hand against
dialog: the other.
text: Miles sits gazing sadly out the window.
text: The room is empty.
text: There is the whir of ventilation.
text: The click of the door attracts both their attention and brings
text: them to their feet.
text: Marylin walks in, chic and beautiful as ever, followed by
text: Ruth, who sits next to her, places her attaché case on the
text: table top, and snaps its clasps.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: Ruth.
text: Miles and Marylin are looking at each other. Quietly:
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hello Marylin.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Hello Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hard to believe this is the way it
dialog: will end up for us.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: It's not something I wanted either.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: But then -- I guess -- something
dialog: inside me died when I realized that
dialog: you'd hired a goon to kill me.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt
dialog: when I realized you'd hired the goon
dialog: to kill...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Now you both wait a minute. Nobody
dialog: hired anyone to kill anyone.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: Hear, hear.
text: There is an uncomfortable shifting in seats. Wrigley looks
dialog: at Miles.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: Apparently, from what I can gather,
dialog: a burglar broke into your house --
text: became despondent over his lifestyle
dialog: and shot himself.
text: Miles is still looking at Marylin.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Where does that leave us?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: We've outlined a settlement...
text: She pushes a piece of paper across the table.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: We think it's more than generous.
text: Miles ignores the paper, which lies unclaimed on the middle
text: of the table. He looks at Marylin.
speaker_heading: WRIGLEY
dialog: My client is prepared to consider a
dialog: reconciliation.
text: Marylin looks a Miles.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: How could I trust you, after... after
dialog: all of this.
text: Miles, staring at Marylin, cuts in:
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You wounded me first, Marylin.
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Forgery? Fraud?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Income tax evasion?
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: Murder?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Murder!
speaker_heading: MARYLIN
dialog: I don't see how we can ever find our
dialog: way back from...
text: Miles, with his eyes still on Marylin, reaches into his suit
text: coat. He withdraws a piece of paper, spreads it flat on the
text: table in front of him and, still gazing at her:
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You know... there's nothing in the
dialog: Massey pre-nup that says it can't be
text: executed after the parties wed.
text: He decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen, looks
text: down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name.
text: He pushes the paper across the table toward Marylin.
text: Gazing at him, seeking the truth in his eyes, she absently
text: picks up the paper.
text: There is a long silence. We hear only the hum of ventilation,
text: and Wrigley's quiet snuffling.
text: Ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses -- over
text: Marylin's shoulder -- at the sheet of paper. Marylin however,
text: looks only at Miles.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It's the Massey pre-nup --
text: Marylin rips the paper in half.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (bored)
dialog: O-kay. I'm going back to the office
text: Wrigley sobs openly.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Come on Wrigley, I'll buy you a drink
