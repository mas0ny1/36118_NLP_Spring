scene_heading: 1 EXT. ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: A strip of two-lane highway runs through a tall pine forest. There
text: is a truck-stop coffee shop beside the roadway. A few 14-WHEELERS
text: are scattered across the big dusty parking lot. Morning sunlight
text: glints off their chrome stacks. It bakes the asphalt and warms the
text: mangy hides of stray DOGS asleep in the dirt. A HELICOPTER hovers
text: about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird. It's the beginning of a
dialog: perfect day.
dialog: 
text: A highway PATROL CAR slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and
text: parks beside the slat and shingled building.
dialog: 
text: TWO TELEPHONE LINEMEN are scaling a power pole at the forest's edge.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2 POWER POLE - ANGLE ON TELEPHONE LINEMEN
dialog: 
text: High on the pole, the linemen lean back against their safety straps
text: to work, their bodies forming a "Y." One of them suddenly turns,
text: pointing at a nearby treetop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIRST LINEMAN
dialog: Lookee there!
dialog: 
text: He grabs a PORCELAIN INSULATOR from his belt, cocks his arm and
text: hurls it across the open stretch. It lands smack in the middle of
text: the tree. SQUAWK! A rattle of leaves, a rustle of feathers and a
text: HUGE BUZZARD comes flapping out. The lineman cackles over his
text: marksmanship.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3 CLOSE ANGLE ON BUZZARD - MOVING SHOT
dialog: 
text: The big, frightened beady-eyed bird is lumbering through the sky,
text: flapping for its life and suddenly...SPLAT! It crashes head-on into
text: 3A the bubble of the passing HELICOPTER.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4 INT. HELICOPTER
dialog: 
text: The ship rocks as the PILOT wrestles the controls. There are THREE
text: OTHERS in the cabin. The man beside the pilot, ELI CROSS, is
text: sketching in a manuscript and eating an apple. He glances up in
dialog: irritation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Hey, will you stop wiggling?!
dialog: 
dialog: -2-
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Don't yell at me...yell at the
dialog: goddamn crazy bird! It tried to
dialog: kill us!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (back to his manuscript)
dialog: Oh yeah, that's your story. What's
dialog: the bird got to say about it?
dialog: 
text: Eli bites into his apple, grimacing at the mushy mouthful He tosses
text: it out the hatch.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 5 EXT. FOREST - TREETOPS
dialog: 
text: The apple drops into the trees, bounces down from branch to branch
text: and falls on the slanted roof of the ROADSIDE DINER beneath. It
text: rolls down the eaves, off the edge and lands on top of the parked
text: Highway Patrol car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 6 INT. PATROL CAR
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIRST POLICEMAN
text: Something hit the roof.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND POLICEMAN
dialog: So will the Chief...if we don't grab
dialog: this guy Cameron.
dialog: 
text: They climb out as we see a SECOND PATROL CAR sliding up behind them.
text: MORE POLICEMEN emerge from the second car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 7 EXT. DINER - ON POLICEMEN
dialog: 
text: They huddle, then move toward the diner entrance. As they pass an
text: open WINDOW the CAMERA HOLDS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINER
dialog: 8
dialog: 
text: A FRY COOK serves behind the long counter where MEN on stools eat
text: watching the overhead TV. There is a PINBALL MACHINE in action.
text: The policemen are seen ENTERING b.g. A TRUCK DRIVER ambles up and
text: straddles a stool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUCK DRIVER
dialog: Gettin' hot early. It's gonna be a
dialog: scorcher.
dialog: 
text: The fry cook fills the driver's empty water glass from a pitcher,
text: then move down the counter.
dialog: 
dialog: -3-
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 9 ANGLE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: He sits a few stools away. He's about 25, even-featured, bone-
text: weary. His appealing face needs a shave. The cook fills his water
text: glass. The ice cubes rattle as Cameron's hand trembles. His eyes
text: are riveted on the policemen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 10 CAMERON'S POV
dialog: 
text: Two policemen take seats at a booth across from the counter; one
text: policeman moves to a WALL TELEPHONE, another stands near the CASH
text: REGISTER looking at a magazine. They seem nonchalant, but are
text: placed to block all avenues of escape.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 11 ANGLE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Suddenly startled as someone slaps him on the arm. He whirls to
text: face the man beside him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: That's really a beaut...really a
dialog: beaut!
dialog: 
text: The MAN is staring at the TATOO which shows below the rolled-up
text: sleeve of Cameron's shirt, a large American Eagle with elaborate
text: scrollwork and a patriotic slogan. The man pulls up his own sleeve
text: to show a small tatoo of an anchor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: My wife still yells about this...but
dialog: yours -- that's some eagle...like a
text: billboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (eyes on police)
dialog: Yeah, that's the grand old bird.
dialog: (a half-smile)
dialog: Right now I just wish the son-of-a-
dialog: bitch could fly.
dialog: 
text: Cameron rises and moves across the diner to the pinball machine.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12 ANGLE ON PINBALL
dialog: 
text: The PLAYER wiggles and contorts, using body English to influence the
dialog: balls.
dialog: 
dialog: -4-
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HECKLER
dialog: Hey Morton, you think your ass is
dialog: connected to the machine? You
dialog: wiggle, it's gonna make the ball go
dialog: where you want?
dialog: 
text: 12A Cameron's eyes scan the room, passing the TV above the counter. On
text: it, the commercial shows a beautiful girl (who we'll later know as
text: NINA FRANKLIN) bending over a bowl of dog food. Her ass, too,
text: 12B wiggles engagingly. The pinball player leaves the machine.
text: Cameron, stalling for time, works the plunger while a cop stalks
text: closer; like the cat to the mouse hole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Hey, you're lucky. Somebody left a
dialog: free ball.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 
text: Cameron shoots. The ball bounces crazily inside the machine, lights
text: and buzzers flashing. Another policeman approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND POLICEMAN
dialog: You got 20,000! You're gonna win...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Win what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND POLICEMAN
dialog: A free game!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Terrific...
dialog: 
text: He rests his hands on the machine, glancing about. Escape seems
dialog: hopeless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: ...that's just what I needed...one
dialog: more chance to lose.
dialog: 
text: In a lightning-swift motion, the cop clamps his hands down over
text: Cameron's wrists, snapping the HANDCUFFS on. The trap has sprung.
scene_heading: 13 CLOSE ON COP AND CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Cameron nods his head in resignation. A big uncontrollable grin
text: breaks and spreads over the cop's face.
dialog: 
dialog: -5-
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then suddenly, Cameron bolts, desperately springing full speed for
text: the back door. He flings it open. The cops are moving toward him.
text: One has almost got his gun out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Cameron! Halt! I'll shoot!
dialog: 
text: Cameron lunges through the doorway, not realizing in his frenzy the
text: screen door still blocks his path. He tears through it, but gets
text: stuck halfway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: No!...God, don't shoot!
dialog: 
text: Swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh, he
text: breaks free and runs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 14 EXT. REAR OF DINER
dialog: 
text: As Cameron flies down the back steps, a COP stationed at the rear
text: door, caught off-guard, tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his
text: back. Cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard, over fences,
text: between the shed and the barn, rolling beneath a building, out the
text: other side. Behind him, distant shouts and a gunshot.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 15 INT. FOREST - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON - DAY
dialog: 
text: As Cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not
text: alien to him. He crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze
text: of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen
text: cones. Sweat pours down his face. His breath rasps in his throat.
text: He breaks into a clearing and FREEZES...suddenly face to face with a
text: MAN who crouches, blocking his path. It is one of the telephone
dialog: linemen we saw earlier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 16 WIDER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: The lineman, kneeling at his tool chest, is surprised by Cameron.
text: The other lineman is halfway up the power pole. They both stare at
text: Cameron's handcuffs. Cameron edges back, his escape route blocked.
text: The man on the ground grabs a WRENCH and moves forward with the same
text: gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINEMAN
dialog: Stand right there like a good old
dialog: boy and do what I say. You wanna
dialog: try and mess with me, you've had
dialog: fair warning. I was a combat Marine
dialog: in Korea. Okay?
dialog: 
dialog: -6-
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The lineman advances on him as Cameron backs away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Korea? No shit, so was my old
dialog: man...
text: (he suddenly stamps his
text: foot and shrieks)
dialog: Aaaaaaaargh!
dialog: 
text: The lineman jumps in surprise. Then, enraged like a startled bull,
text: he lunges forward with the wrench. Cameron uses the man's weight
text: against him, his moves those of a trained fighter. A hard knee to
text: his stomach doubles up the lineman. The handcuffed arms slam down
text: like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground.
text: A kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out. The other
text: lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one
text: step back up. Cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed
text: grasp and dashes off into the forest.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 17 MOVING SHOT - ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: He slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the
text: bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds
text: his head and drinks. CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the terrain. There are no
text: pursuers, the forest is silent.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 18 CLOSE UP - HANDCUFFS
dialog: 
text: The jaws of a wire-cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting
text: the cuffs around Cameron's wrists. He lifts his knee from the
text: cutter handle. His arms are now free. He wedges a chisel against
text: one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it. We hear his
text: sharp outcry.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 19 ANGLE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Doubled up, holding his wrist in pain. The bracelet is still
text: intact. He buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs
text: the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above.
scene_heading: 20 EXT. OLD ABANDONED ROAD - DAY
dialog: 
text: Cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the
text: mountainous pass. He crosses a bridge. Through the arches of its
text: low stone railing, he sees a BLACK RIVER twenty feet below rushing
text: toward the sea. Then, glancing back, he is suddenly alert.
dialog: 
dialog: -7-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 21 CAMERON'S POV
dialog: 
text: In the far distance, almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from
text: the road, is a tiny speck moving toward him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 22 ANGLE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: He clambers down the embankment behind the railing, peering out from
text: this hidden vantage.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 23 ANGLE ON ROAD
dialog: 
text: The speck grows larger. The SOUND of the engine is faintly audible
text: now. Sunlight flashes from metal and glass. Cameron's apprehension
text: suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as
text: he had feared, but something else. Moving in the shimmering heat
text: wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked World War I vintage DUESENBERG
text: SEDAN with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him.
scene_heading: 24 ANGLE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: He scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride. The Duesenberg
text: roars past him, filling his eyes and mouth with dust. Suddenly
text: there is a screech of brakes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 25 ANGLE ON CAR
dialog: 
text: The Duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop.
text: Running, Cameron reaches the car, pulls the front door open and
text: climbs in beside the DRIVER.
scene_heading: 26 INT. CAR
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Thanks. I thought you didn't see
dialog: me.
dialog: 
text: The driver, BURT, is a husky, red-haired man about Cameron's age and
text: deeply agitated. Pounding his fist against the steering wheel, he
text: talks half to Cameron, half to himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Damn it. Screwed it up. Lost my
dialog: nerve.
dialog: 
text: Fishing a Vick's inhaler from his pocket and shoving it in his
dialog: nostril.
dialog: 
dialog: -8-
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddamn sinuses. Can't even see
dialog: straight.
dialog: 
text: Cameron looks at him, puzzled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You want me to drive?
dialog: 
text: Burt whirls on him, enraged.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: What the hell is that supposed to
dialog: mean?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (confused)
dialog: No offense...thought you might...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Every one of you jerks is a goddamn
dialog: hotshot expert! Thanks for the vote
dialog: of confidence. If you think you can
dialog: do any better, just come and try it!
dialog: 
text: He puts his boot in Cameron's stomach and shoves hard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 27 EXT. CAR
dialog: 
text: Cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the
text: Duesenberg squeals forward, its open door slamming shut from the
dialog: momentum.
dialog: 
text: Stunned, the wind knocked out of him, Cameron rises to his elbows.
text: Before the old relic has gone thirty yards, again the brakes
text: screech, swinging the car into a sliding salute turn, one hundred-
text: eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward Cameron.
dialog: 28
scene_heading: INT. CAR - ANGLE ON BURT
dialog: 
text: Driving with one hand on the door handle, his head halfway out the
text: window watching the bridge railing and the water beyond.
dialog: 
dialog: -9-
dialog: 
scene_heading: 29 ANGLE ON ROAD - CAR AND CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Cameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight
text: of the Duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down. His hand closes
text: over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier
text: flings a Coke bottle at a tank, Cameron hurls the rock in the
text: direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways. The big
text: spinning tires brush him as they pass. We catch a momentary glimpse
text: of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield.
dialog: 
text: As he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed,
text: expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence. He opens
text: his eyes, climbs to his feet. The road is empty. The Duesenberg is
text: gone. Astonished, confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge
text: where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. There is
text: nothing below but the rushing black water. Here and there bubbles
text: swirl to the surface. They could be from a sinking car or could be
dialog: caused by the current.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 30 ANGLE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: His thoughts racing. Was it the sun, has he imagined the whole
text: thing? Suddenly a HELICOPTER appears, hovering, almost at eye
text: level. Sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 31 WIDER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: It is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence. It has
text: swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing,
text: catching Cameron with no chance to run or hide. FOUR MEN Can be
text: seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away. The man
text: beside the PILOT is ELI CROSS. He grabs the radio microphone and
text: begins speaking into it. Cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a
text: field. The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water,
text: hovers. Protected from sight, Cameron runs between the tall stalks,
text: away from the road.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 32 CAMERON - MOVING SHOT
dialog: 
text: Glancing back through the stalks as he runs, Cameron sees a STAKE
text: TRUCK barreling toward the sight of the accident. In the back,
text: THREE MEN are frantically putting on black wet-suits. They look,
text: from this distance, like little black toys tumbling against each
text: other. Cameron runs on.
dialog: 
dialog: - 10 -
dialog: 
scene_heading: 33 EXT. BLUFF - OVERLOOKING SEASHORE TOWN
dialog: 
text: A few hotels, like a cluster of old Victorian gingerbread, surround
text: a sandy cove beyond which is the sea. There is a fishing pier,
text: boardwalk, hot dog stands, pizza parlors, all swarming with
text: sunbathing TOURISTS. The town's bucolic, turn-of-the-century charm
text: might even survive these, if not for a monstrous yellow CONSTRUCTION
text: CRANE, which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the
text: sandy cove. Cameron appears on the bluff.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 34 ANGLE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Surveying the town -- expressionless, a jungle beast going to
dialog: survive no matter what -- at least for a few more hours. He reaches
text: down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh, turning them into
text: cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear. He pulls off his worn
text: boots and flings them into the brush, his eyes never leaving the
text: town below. There are crowds to get lost in down there. He
text: unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his
text: wrist. Stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet
text: against it. It won't open. Grimacing in pain, he re-buttons the
text: sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward
dialog: the town.
scene_heading: 35 EXT. BOARDWALK
dialog: 
text: The SCREEN is yellow and on it are the words: 'HAVE A NICE DAY.'
text: THE ANGLE WIDENS and we realize the words are on the back of a
text: YELLOW HAT that jiggles as its wearer walks. It is Cameron. Beyond
text: him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with
text: the sun. Teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis.
text: The boardwalk cops in white shirts, looking like ice cream vendors,
text: whom Cameron deftly avoids. Then, he looks up at the sky,
text: perplexed: the helicopter from the bridge is overhead, circling.
text: Cameron watches it warily as he walks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 35A ANGLE ON BOARDWALK
dialog: 
text: A BIG CROWD has formed at the railing of the pier. Many of the
text: people with CAMERAS CLICKING at the sand below. Cameron notices the
text: helicopter is now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open
text: cockpit BIPLANE. It is a WORLD WAR I FIGHTER with BRITISH INSIGNIA.
dialog: 
text: 35B ANGLE ON BOARDWALK AND SKY
dialog: 
text: Cameron works his way through the crowd. All eyes now look upward
text: at the plane. A LOUD VOICE is HEARD coming through an electric
speaker_heading: BULLHORN.
dialog: 
dialog: - 11 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: All right, people. Quiet! We're
dialog: losing the sun! This is a take!
dialog: You're welcome to watch, but please,
dialog: no flashbulbs. They'll spoil the
dialog: shot.
dialog: 
text: Cameron's world has become more ordered again. It's a film company
text: shooting on location -- this somehow must explain the Duesenberg.
text: His eyes go to the scene below.
speaker_heading: 36 ANGLE ON COVE
dialog: 
text: A CAMERA RIG suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane
text: is PHOTOGRAPHING the surf where EXTRAS in German WWI uniforms
text: unload ashore. The bright little plane has started a lazy dive
text: toward the soldiers, its engine whining. From here it looks as
text: fearsome as Snoopy and the Red Baron.
dialog: 
text: 37 ANGLE ON THE BEACH
dialog: 
text: As the British plane pulls out of the dive, there is a tremendous
text: explosion. In the flash of smoke and flame, barge, rowboats,
text: ammunition and people are blown sky-high. The smoke from the
text: exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene.
scene_heading: 38 ANGLE ON CROWD
dialog: 
text: The onlookers are very impressed and pleased and then abruptly their
text: pleasure turns to horror and disbelief.
speaker_heading: 39 ANGLE ON COVE
dialog: 
text: As the smoke lifts, the Tom and Jerry violence has become a
text: horrifying reality. Bodies are scattered about. One man has been
text: severed in half, drenched in blood. Chunks of meat, arms and legs
text: litter the beach.
scene_heading: 40 ANGLE ON CROWD
dialog: 
text: Paralyzed by the sense of catastrophe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Something went wrong.
dialog: 
text: Then, people begin to moan and scream.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: 41 CLOSE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Staring tensely at the carnage. By reflex, a shout escapes his
dialog: lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Medic! Get the medics!
text: 41A A WOMAN sags into a faint. A small child in the crowd is crying and
text: clutching Cameron's leg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 42 ANGLE ON COVE
dialog: 
text: As the scene continues we hear a voice on the Bullhorn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Cut! I said CUT! That's a print.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the reality of the horror turns into an obscene, absurd
text: farce as what appear to be the missing parts of bodies begin
text: wriggling out of the sand where the extras were partially buried to
text: create the macabre effect and now the extras become whole human
text: beings before our eyes once again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 43 ANOTHER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: The crowd reacts in various ways. Sighs of relief, laughter, anger.
text: The exhumed extras wipe sand from their eyes and shake it down their
text: trouser legs.
dialog: 
dialog: A.D.
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Beautiful, Harvey. You gave
dialog: everybody a heart attack.
dialog: 
text: HARVEY, the Second Unit Director, yells back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Eli will hate it. He said he wanted
dialog: the shot in one? Now watch, he'll
dialog: do six hours of pick-ups.
dialog: 
text: The crowd disperses. A TOURIST turns to Cameron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOURIST
dialog: Great...but why do they always use
dialog: so much blood? It ruins the

text: (still shaken, quietly

dialog:

text: by the beating sound of the helicopter. He glances up.
speaker_heading: 44 CAMERON'S POV
dialog: 
text: The helicopter is descending toward the beach while the FILM CREW
text: rapidly moves equipment from the last scene into piles to clear a
dialog: landing site.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 45 ANGLE ON FISHING PIER
dialog: 
text: Wary of the men in the chopper, Cameron is moving down the pier away
text: from the landing site. Suddenly he stops short, caught by something
text: he sees O.S. Excitedly he points and begins to shout.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Hey! Hey you...!
speaker_heading: 46 CAMERON'S POV
dialog: 
text: Below him, walking away on the sand is one of the actors with the
text: same red hair, the same old British army jacket as Burt -- the man
text: in the Duesenberg. Hearing the shout, the actor stops and
text: tentatively turns. It's a mistake. Clearly the features are
dialog: different. It's not Burt.
scene_heading: 47 ANGLE TO INCLUDE CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Cameron is puzzled. He watches as the red-haired actor looks about
text: to see who called and finding no one, starts off, but is stopped by
text: a LITTLE OLD LADY holding a parasol and offering her autograph book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LITTLE OLD LADY
dialog: Mr. Bailey! Aren't you Raymond
dialog: Bailey, the actor? Would you please
dialog: sign your autograph? Write 'to
dialog: Emily...for eternal peace.'
dialog:

speaker_heading: LITTLE OLD LADY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm certainly glad you're all right.
dialog: I lost my husband and my son in the

dialog: 
text: The sound of the chopper blades has become deafening as it hovers
text: for a landing. The Old Lady snatches her autograph book and heads
dialog: for the landing site.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 48 ANGLE ON HELICOPTER
dialog: 
text: As it touches the ground and its doors fly open. Out step the

dialog: 
text: Their words are lost in the sound of the rotor as the chopper slowly

dialog: 
scene_heading: 49 ANGLE INCLUDING CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Cameron, sitting on the edge of the pier over the water, has watched

text: Lady directly beneath him. Reaching down toward her, he yells:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Hey! Hey, give me your hand!
dialog: 
text: He can't quite reach her. As a last resort, he drops off the edge

dialog: 
text: He grabs for the struggling Old Lady.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Don't be afraid! You're gonna be

dialog: 
text: Like groping through seaweed, he reaches past her tangled skirts,

text: choking, gasping for air. She turns her face toward him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 51 CAMERON'S POV
dialog: 
text: Her features are distorted; they seem to be melting away. She frees
text: her hand and violently tears at her face, pulling away the RUBBER

speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
text: He grabs the bread, blows the shot,

speaker_heading: ELI

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (being glib)
dialog: Once, to save my ass, I jumped out
text: of a banana tree into an oxcart full
dialog: of buffalo shit. Does that count?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: We'll see. Put these on.
dialog: 
text: He throws Cameron some knee pads from his stunt bag and begins

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (puzzled by the pads)
dialog: Where do they go?

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (tapping his knee)

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Okie-dokie.
dialog: 
text: Makes a casual jump, landing on the line and looking at Chuck for
dialog: approval.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Very good. Except you're dead!!
dialog: Your brains are scattered all over

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You're still dead! You fell over

dialog: 
text: Cameron has landed three beyond the mark and looks up at Chuck a bit

speaker_heading: CHUCK (CONT'D)
dialog: You wanna try it right, once? You
dialog: should land in a tuck-and-roll.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Show me, sergeant.
dialog: 
text: Chuck launches himself head-first. His hands touch the ground just
text: beyond the second mark to break his fall, easing him into a shoulder
text: roll, he somersaults to his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Very fancy.
dialog: 
text: He takes a running start and does the same. Not quite as well, but
text: well enough. As he rolls to his feet:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Better.

speaker_heading: CAMERON

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: And Burt's specialty was drowning.
dialog: You know one goddamn daredevil on
dialog: this picture was enough! What the
dialog: hell was Eli thinking, giving me a
dialog: smart-ass, cocky, amateur kid when I
dialog: need a stunt man! It's a little
dialog: different running across that roof
dialog: when they're pumping tracer bullets
dialog: over your head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (eloquently pleading his
dialog: case)
dialog: I was running for twenty-six months
dialog: with guys shooting at me...not over

dialog: I knew daredevils. I got nothing
dialog: against them...it's just they're all

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (as he walks)
dialog: We'll draw a sight line for you to

dialog: very difficult. But this is where
dialog: you gotta think. Your mind can't be

dialog: 
text: They have reached the lower edge of the roof. Cameron looks down at

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Or my brains are all over the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Now here's where the scuffle ends.
dialog: When the pipe breaks loose, you fall

text: it, wavering in his resolve to leave, wondering what would happen
dialog: if...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA'S VOICE
dialog: What next? Do you rescue the maiden
dialog: from the tower?
dialog: 
text: She has come up behind him, unnoticed. He turns, startled, and
text: there she stands.
dialog: 
dialog: - 47 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
text: For a moment they search each other's eyes -- for intentions. Then
text: she glances at the tower.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Yes. It does look pretty high.
dialog: (with concern)
dialog: Are you worried about tomorrow?
dialog: 
text: Cameron's mind is racing over all the things he'd like to say so she
text: would know him instantly. But his answer is simple and sounds
dialog: sincere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Not much. I guess if there were any
dialog: real danger, Eli wouldn't let me do
dialog: it, would he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (quickly, reassuring)
dialog: No. I'm sure it's safe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
text: (abruptly, with a boyish
dialog: grin)
dialog: Good. Then you jump.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: She understands the slightly jealous rebuke for her blind faith in
text: Eli. Her laughing answer hangs like a challenge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Well, come on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (willing, but flustered)
dialog: What, right now?
dialog: 
text: For a moment he weighs it: whether to "run" or stay. Then acts on
text: his decision. Starting to laugh, he takes her hand and pulls her
text: toward the tower. She holds back, struggling playfully.
dialog: 
dialog: - 48 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait, I'm afraid of heights! What
dialog: if I freeze up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (pulling her along)
dialog: Don't worry, I'll give you a push.
dialog: Isn't that what a pal's for?
scene_heading: 77 INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It is crowded with bells, a small walkway and railing surrounded
text: them. The city lights are seen beyond. Below are the sheds where
text: crewmen are preparing the next day's shooting. Just beyond is the
text: overwhelming silhouette of the huge CRANE. Nina and Cameron reach
text: the top of the stairs winded and laughing, as they rush to the
text: railing and lean over. Nina gasps, clutching Cameron in genuine
dialog: fright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (gasps)
dialog: Oh, my God! It's terrifying! You
dialog: can't jump from this...you'll get
dialog: killed! It's crazy!...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: ...It's not that bad. It looks
dialog: worse at night... Chuck says it's
text: like robbing a candy store.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (getting angry)
dialog: Now stop that! ...I'm going back.
dialog: 
text: She whirls to go. He stops her, taking her by the shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: ...What's wrong?
dialog: 
text: Her concern for him has turned to anger, like a mother slapping her
text: child for running in the street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: It's just dumb...to strut around
dialog: trying to talk brave...
dialog: 
text: His arm still restrains her. She takes hold of it, then suddenly
text: softens with a look of slight surprise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: 
dialog: - 49 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Oh...you are scared...aren't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: Not really.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Yes. You are...You're trembling.
dialog: 
text: After a moment, he answers quietly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: So are you...and you're not even
dialog: gonna jump.
dialog: 
text: It's true. She is trembling and so is he -- not from fear. He
text: slowly draws her toward him, her mouth reaching up to his. And then
text: they are devouring each other. Abruptly, they're illuminated by a
text: fierce blast of white light. They separate and stare, blinking in
text: shock and confusion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI (V.O.)
dialog: Okay, hit two and three.
dialog: 
text: They are pinned in the crossbeams of two more giant arcs. Quickly
text: she yanks him down with her out of sight behind the railing.

text: Gabe adjusts one of the giant brutes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: (business as usual)
dialog: I could kill this brute and fill
dialog: with juniors. You'd get a halo
text: around the tower.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (struggling to resist)
dialog: Got no time...it's an establishing
text: shot...two seconds on the screen.
dialog: (giving in)
dialog: ...You got six minutes.

scene_heading: 80 EXT. CHURCHYARD - BENEATH THE TOWER - NIGHT
dialog:

scene_heading: 81 CLOSE ON CAMERON AND NINA
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: ...And those bells are so
dialog: interesting. Imagine four hundred
dialog: years ago by boat from Amsterdam.
dialog: Thank you for the tour. It was so

dialog: father. He's so interested in God
dialog: and things like that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI'S VOICE
dialog: Hiya. Want a lift?
dialog: 
text: Eli miraculously appears from above. He descends and rides around

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (ducking)
dialog: Oh, for Christ's sake...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: There once was a maiden fair,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Eli, get away with that thing!
dialog: 
dialog: - 51 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: ...Could it be Raymond who's turning
dialog: this dame on? ...Or his double,
dialog: young Lucky Pierre?
dialog: 
text: Unable to elude Eli in his basket, Nina turns on him in mock
dialog: frustration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: It's gotten to the point where I
dialog: have to look under the stopper of
dialog: the bathtub when I take a shower to
dialog: make sure I've got some privacy!
dialog: (broadly gesturing to
dialog: group)
dialog: Thank you one and all and good
dialog: night!
dialog: 
text: Privately, she gives Cameron's arm an affectionate squeeze, then
text: disappears around the corner of the building. He is left holding
text: the beach bag, pursued by the Peter Pan in the basket. It has now
text: dropped to ground level so Eli is looking up at Cameron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Step right in, folks...the "Killer
dialog: Crane" ride of the century.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Thanks, I'll walk.
dialog: 
text: Eli's basket now moves up a few feet so he's looking down at
text: Cameron, riding beside him while he walks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Ah, youth. Six hours in town and
text: caught with the leading lady. Not
dialog: bad. Shouldn't be so upset.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Okay to be upset about what happened
dialog: in the dining room? Why'd you
dialog: promise to show that cop the film?
dialog: He'll recognize me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: You really don't trust me, do you?
dialog: Hop in. I got a present for you.
dialog: 
dialog: - 52 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He pulls Cameron into the basket beside him so unexpectedly that
text: Cameron drops Sam's bag. Eli picks it up and plops it into
text: Cameron's lap. Suddenly Cameron finds himself soaring skyward at a
text: stomach-churning rate -- while Eli rattles on...probing, disarming,
dialog: quixotic...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: You constantly amaze me. You don't
dialog: go to movies. What's that tatoo, a
dialog: disguise? You a Commie? Don't you
dialog: know that King Kong was only three
text: feet tall? He came up to Fay Wray's
dialog: belly button. If God could only do
dialog: the tricks we can. What are you
dialog: worried about the film and the cop
dialog: for?
dialog: 
text: Now, hanging ten stories above the city, Eli is adjusting his
text: viewer, looking at a cluster of RED FLASHING LIGHTS IN THE DISTANCE.
text: He hands the viewer to Cameron, who looks through it.
dialog: 
text: 81A We see a telescoped view of THE POLICE ROADBLOCK at the end of a
text: highway with cars waiting to get past ARMED POLICE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON'S VOICE

dialog: Keep it.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (patting Sam's beach bag)
dialog: You've got that look again. That

dialog: record for the 50-yard dash. Is
dialog: that why all those cops are chasing
dialog: you? What are you, some kind of sex
dialog: freak running across America with
dialog: your fly open? Is that why they're
dialog: after you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You're close. What's your advice?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Button your fly and be at the

text: with the rest of the crew. Climb
dialog: aboard our chartered 707 and fly
dialog: away with us to where the setting
text: sun bleeds into a million swimming
dialog: pools a man can hide in. You do
dialog: swim as well as run?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (overwhelmed by the
dialog: offer)
dialog: I'll swim like a fish. You really
dialog: mean it?
dialog: (Eli nods)
dialog: Why are you trying to save my ass?
dialog: 
text: Eli hesitates, then answers quietly -- for him there is great
dialog: meaning in it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: ...Because you're as crazy as the
dialog: guy I'm doing the picture about.
text: (then grinning archly,

dialog: 
scene_heading: 82 EXT. CHURCH TOWER - NEXT MORNING - BRIGHT DAYLIGHT
dialog: 
text: The thunderous clang of bells! Cameron ready, coiled tight, heart
text: pounding as loud as the bells. A burst of machine gun bullets tears
text: through the railing beside him, sending splinters flying against his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: 83 CAMERA CREW
dialog: 
text: HARVEY (Second Unit Director) and CAMERA OPERATOR behind the

scene_heading: 84 IN BELL TOWER
dialog: 
text: Near Cameron, the SECOND A.D., crouched out of sight with a walkie-
text: talkie, stabs a finger at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND A.D.
dialog: Go!...Go!
dialog: 
text: A burst of tracer bullets streak past Cameron. Sparks fly, as stray
text: bullets seem to bounce and ricochet off the bells.
speaker_heading: 85 MACHINE GUN
dialog: 
text: A 50-calibre MACHINE GUN, a SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN in Levi's and sport
text: shirt, pumping tracers past the bell tower.
scene_heading: 86 TWO SHOT - BELL TOWER
dialog: 
text: The Second A.D. slams his hand down on a PLUNGER, setting off a
text: series of explosive squibs. Like machine gun bullets, they start
text: shattering the railing, moving toward Cameron, forcing him to the
text: edge of the tower.
dialog: 
text: Vaulting over the rail, he clings to the side of the bell tower.
text: Explosive bursts disintegrate the railing in his hand. He shoves
text: out, launching himself into space. Twisting, hurtling across the
text: gap between the buildings, falling, crashing to the slate roof,
text: crawling and scrambling for a hand hold. The relentless tracer
text: bullets chip the slate beside him. Crouching low, Cameron, like an
text: animal, moves across the roof to the safety of a water tower.
text: Squibs burst over his head and spouts of water stream from the
dialog: tower.
dialog: 
dialog: - 55 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Moving around the tower, suddenly there are TWO GERMAN SOLDIERS
text: running at him with bayoneted rifles. He wheels and there stands
text: ANOTHER GERMAN (Chuck), who leaps toward him, slamming down his
text: rifle butt. The blow glances off Cameron. They grapple, kicking,
text: clawing, rolling down the steep slope, picking up momentum.
speaker_heading: 87 RAIN GUTTER
dialog: 
text: The roof's edge rushes toward them, below it a fearsome drop.
text: Cameron's hands reach out desperately grabbing for the railing as
text: Chuck, screaming, hurtles off the edge, writhing as his body tumbles
text: in space toward the ground.
speaker_heading: 88 CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Sweat pouring from his face, a gash on his cheek gushes blood, his

dialog: Go!...Go!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 90 ROOF
dialog: 
text: Cameron, running for his life along the edge of the roof, the

text: wall two stories below. He scrambles off the roof. Clinging to the
text: down spout, he starts descending it.
scene_heading: 91 SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN
dialog: 
text: Looking up from the ground, he yanks a control rope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 92 CAMERON
dialog: 
text: The bracket holding the down spout breaks loose. The spout starts
text: to fall away from the side of the building. Cameron clings to it,
text: riding its downward arc as though it were a falling tree.
dialog: 
dialog: - 56 -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 93 AWNING
dialog: 
text: At the end of the arc, Cameron throws himself free for a safe
text: landing and smashes against the awning. Instead of holding, it rips
text: apart like paper and, in that unexpected instant, Cameron's eyes
text: widen in genuine terror as he plummets through the shredded canvas
text: toward a skylight one floor below.
speaker_heading: 94 SKYLIGHT
dialog: 
text: Exploding in a shower of glass and wood as it is struck by Cameron's
text: body. He hurtles downward toward a blur of images.
speaker_heading: 95 ANGLE ON COT
dialog: 
text: Collapsing from the impact of Cameron's fall. The MAN and WOMAN who
text: were making love on the cot have been flung to the ground and roll
text: entwined with him. Cameron is dazed. Like a drowning man, he rages
text: to free himself from the tangle of naked limbs and smothering flesh.
text: A painted face shrieks in laughter -- as the door to the room he is
text: in is thrown open, revealing:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 96 BROTHEL SET ­ INT. MUNICIPAL BUILDING
dialog: 
text: Cameron has fallen into a cubicle in what appears to be a World War
text: I German army brothel. In the high-ceilinged room, there is a row
text: of cots separated by makeshift screens. COUPLES jump up from the
text: cots startled. A line of partly naked GERMAN SOLDIERS waiting their
text: turn at the whores have broken into shouts and laughter at Cameron's
text: unorthodox entrance. They crowd around the cubicle where Cameron
text: fell and now struggles with the couple.

scene_heading: 97 ANGLE ON CAMERA CREW

text: the blood from Cameron's face smears a whore's body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI'S VOICE
dialog: Cut!
dialog: 
text: Instantly everything stops. Cameron is sprawled half-naked on his
text: knees at the end of the line. Enraged, he whirls toward Eli who has
text: caused this humiliation. Then the CLAPPING begins, the CAST and
text: CREW applauding his stunt. People slap him on the back admiringly.
text: A robe is thrown around him. He is helped to his feet. Suddenly
text: Nina is there flinging her arms about him and kissing him on the
dialog: mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I'm so proud of you...I could just
dialog: die!
dialog: 
text: He is pulled away from her by the backslappers. Now Cameron is
dialog: responding to this strange new sensation -- the warmth of public
text: acclaim. He regains his poise, hoping his embarrassing anger wasn't
text: noticed. Chuck is now beside him, reaching up to the wound on
text: Cameron's face and pulling away the plastic makeup patch with fake
text: blood inside; the "wound" is gone. He starts feeling Cameron's
text: shoulders, arms and ribs for possible damage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELI

dialog: whorehouse.
text: (putting his arm around
dialog: Cameron)
dialog: How about that, Lucky? When that
dialog: stunt man's boob hit you in the
dialog: mouth, was it just another boob...or
dialog: did it taste like kraut?
dialog: 
text: The crew laughs and so does Nina. Cameron feels humiliated by Eli's
text: patronizing tone.

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: It tasted lousy. But what do I

speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: That's a daring touch, Raymond! The

dialog: 
text: There is general laughter, but not shared by Cameron. He

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: How they get the film developed so
dialog: fast?
dialog: 
text: Without even glancing at him, Nina gets up and moves to a chair some

text: resigned to the ways of women, he goes over and sits beside her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: What's the matter?

speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (turning on him)

speaker_heading: 107A POV
dialog: 
text: On the portable screen, Raymond in helmet and goggles is in the

dialog: "WINGS").
dialog: 
scene_heading: PRODUCTION MANAGER'S VOICE
dialog: Who says nothin' changes? Like to
dialog: see one of our boys in a B-52 try
dialog: that.
dialog: 
text: Eli's voice yells 'cut' on the sound track. The angle on the

text: ground with an electric fan blowing wind in Raymond's face.
dialog: 
dialog: - 68 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Now the scene on the portable screen changes: from the ground, we
text: see the same biplane flying low. An object drops from the cockpit
text: (the boot). Then there is a burst of flame in the engine. Trailing
text: smoke, the plane wobbles, crash-lands (sliding alarmingly close to
text: CAMERA). It ground-loops, goes up on one wing and, as it crashes
text: down, we see that the pilot who we assumed was Raymond, is really a
text: dummy that is flapping absurdly and falling to pieces before our
text: eyes during the crash. There are groans, laughter and raspberries

scene_heading: 109 (SHOCK CUT TO SKY) - CLOSE ON GERMAN FIGHTER PLANE - DAY
dialog: 
text: It screams down vertically, full power, machine guns blazing, then
text: smashes into the earth, shredding to fragments hurled in every
text: direction. The dead German pilot is flung crumpled to the ground.
text: The plane's carcass explodes, filling the screen with fire and black
text: smoke through which we see a brightly colored PARACHUTE descending.
text: The FIGURE dangling beneath it passes through the smoke and flames
text: and tumbles to the ground, rolling, his parachute now ablaze. It is
text: Cameron dressed in a British flyer's uniform.
speaker_heading: 110 ANGLE WIDENS
dialog: 
text: To show the hand-held Arriflex at Gabe's eye, Eli behind him,
text: steering Gabe by the back of his belt and carrying the battery pack
text: as they photograph Cameron shedding the harness. With the camera,
text: they crouch and move together like a three-headed, four-armed, four-
text: legged creature.
dialog: 
text: Banking steeply, a British fighter roars past Cameron, its wingtip
text: almost brushing the ground, machine guns rattling, driving some
text: advancing German soldiers back toward the woods.
dialog: 
text: The plane touches down to rescue Cameron, the pilot beckoning.
text: Cameron has pulled off the dead German pilot's boots and helmet.
text: Stray bullets strike about him as he sprints to the idling British
text: plane. It is a single-seater. It starts to pick up speed. He
text: grabs a strut and scrambles up onto the lower wing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 111 ANGLE ON CONSTRUCTION CRANE
dialog: 
text: The bucket hanging from the giant CRANE descends. Smoothly Eli
text: guides Gabe backward, seating him in the bucket. The bucket rises,
text: lifting Gabe while he photographs the scene, as the plane with
text: Cameron on the wing becomes airborne.
scene_heading: 112 ANGLE ON PICKET FENCE
dialog:

scene_heading: 113 ANGLE ON CRANE BUCKET AND BRITISH AIRPLANE
dialog: 
text: The giant arm of the crane swings and rises with the plane,
text: completing Gabe's spectacular shot. Now we see a HELICOPTER drop
text: into frame, photographing the plane from the other side. The
text: chopper and the vintage British plane bank together in perfect tight
text: formation with Cameron standing spread-eagled between the wing
text: struts like a flying Christ, as they soar into the sun.
scene_heading: 114 ANGLE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Seated on the wing, his back against he fuselage, legs firmly
text: against the struts. His white silk scarf streams into the tearing
text: wind. Jamming a champagne bottle into the German's boot, he holds
text: it up. The pilot grins approval, popping the cork on a second
text: bottle which spouts foam into the slipstream. Laughing, he passes a
text: glass to Cameron and pours from above. The liquid is lost in the
text: wind. Shrugging, he swigs from the bottle and hands it to Cameron.
text: Cameron drinks. The champagne pours down his throat and face and,
text: holding the strut with one hand, he rises to his feet.
dialog: 
text: The pilot waggles his wings, giving Cameron a seesaw ride to get his
text: bottle back. Cameron now seems drunk. He lets go of the strut and
text: stands leaning against the wind. As the pilot toasts his courage,
text: Cameron's balance falters and he grabs the strut.
dialog: 
text: Now, Cameron picks his way through the guywires toward the end of
text: the wing. Then he bounces up and down, rocking the plane. The
text: pilot starts to sing to Cameron's rhythm, "How ya gonna keep 'em
text: down on the farm..." And Cameron dances the Charleston.

text: sickening momentum grows, until his feet are flung out from under
text: him and he dangles from the wing, whipping in space.
speaker_heading: 117 WIDE ANGLE
dialog: 
dialog: Suddenly it becomes clear how what we are seeing is possible -- the
text: airplane is no longer in flight, but is dangling a few feet above
text: the ground, suspended from the cable of the huge crane. The crewmen
text: shove at its tail and wingtips to keep it revolving. Cameron is,
text: indeed, clinging to the wing strut, his feet held in space by the

scene_heading: 123 EXTREME CLOSE UP - CAMERON
dialog:

speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I start out as a young girl hiding

speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: The clock's electric. It'll ring
dialog: forever.
dialog: 
text: Instead of turning off the clock, he crosses to the Old Lady's dress
text: on a hanger. He looks at the dress appraisingly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Eli might really go for that, the

speaker_heading: NINA

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Nina has emerged from the ladies' room looking miserable and is
text: walking toward them. At the shock of seeing Cameron, her hand flies
text: to her mouth in such embarrassment and joy and confusion at the way
text: she feels, that she starts back to the refuge of the ladies' room.
text: Catching herself, she turns back to face him, her eyes now glowing
text: with tears of happiness.

scene_heading: 142 HOTEL CORRIDOR - CLOSE ON CAMERON - LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog: 
text: He moves forward and kisses Nina. We now realize we are at her
text: HOTEL ROOM DOOR. She on the inside, he on the outside, kissing
text: through the doorway, which stands slightly ajar. With their mouths
dialog: barely parting:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I'm sorry it got so late...that damn
dialog: five o'clock makeup call...I feel as
dialog: bad as you do...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: In the same place I do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Will you take a raincheck?
dialog: (slipping her room key in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: A season pass.

speaker_heading: NINA

scene_heading: 143 INT. HOTEL BAR - LATE NIGHT
dialog: 
text: On HENRY (the ASSISTANT CAMERAMAN who Eli screamed at), his luggage
text: beside him, his elbows, empties, loose change scattered before him
text: on the bar top.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Lucky...hey Lucky, come over here!
dialog: 
dialog: - 94 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ANGLE shifts to include Cameron a few stools down. He looks up from

speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess who tole 'em to take their job

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON

dialog: Fuckin' A. Gettin' out tonight.
dialog: But not without splittin' a Schlitz
dialog: with the one guy, 'cept me, who
dialog: wouldn't take shit from that
dialog: screwball.
dialog: 
text: As the BARTENDER is taking away the empties, Henry puts his finger
text: down on a DIME.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Change is for you, except that.
dialog: That's a very special dime.
dialog: (holds it up for Cameron
dialog: to see)
dialog: Know what this is? Ask me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: It's a dime...am I close?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's Eli Cross' ass. People think
dialog: 'cause you're easygoin' they can
dialog: walk all over you. Bull-shit...I'm
dialog: blowin' the whistle with this dime
dialog: in that phone...killin' a man and
dialog: hiding it from the police...are you
dialog: kiddin'...? Who is he think he is?
dialog: 
text: Cameron pales, knowing that drunken Henry's desire for revenge can
text: expose him to the police. He grabs the dime from Henry's fingers
text: and drops it into a PEANUT VENDING MACHINE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What the hell you doin'?
dialog: 
text: Cameron stuffs the bag of peanuts in Henry's shirt pocket, grabs his
text: suitcase and hustles him out of the bar toward the FRONT DOOR.

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: 
dialog: - 95 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: I'm putting you in a cab for your

dialog: mine. Just leave that son-of-a-
dialog: bitch to me!
dialog: 
text: They have reached the HOTEL DOORWAY. By now, Henry is convinced
text: Cameron means business. He stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Do whatever you wanna do, but I
dialog: better do it with ya! You'll need
dialog: help 'cause that goddamn looney is
dialog: dangerous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (blustering)
dialog: Not to me, he ain't. I'm going to
dialog: the cops. You gotta earn your
dialog: living in pictures, but I don't give

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Don't be too sure. Damned psycho
dialog: nearly strangled me! Don't believe

speaker_heading: CAMERON

dialog: I watched that whole thing today, he
dialog: didn't even touch you.
dialog: 
dialog: - 96 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Not today. When Burt went into the
dialog: water.
dialog: (Cameron is wide-eyed)
dialog: I could tell from up there in the
dialog: chopper something' was wrong. So, I
dialog: stopped shootin' and that crazy man
dialog: gets me by the throat and starts
dialog: screamin' to roll the film...I mean
dialog: that guy's down there dying and he's
dialog: screamin', "Keep shooting! Keep
text: shooting!" Then, he starts fighting
dialog: me for the switch and it falls
dialog: down...like a crazy house up there,
text: with him thrashin' on the floor...He
dialog: didn't care about Burt. All he
dialog: cared about was to get that man
dialog: dyin' on film! Sickest thing I ever
dialog: seen!
dialog: 
text: As Henry's last words sink in, Cameron stands pale and shaken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I better grab that cab.
dialog: 
text: Henry takes the suitcase from Cameron's numb hand and pushes through
text: the door, looks back for a parting shot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You tell 'em everything...don't
dialog: mince words...
dialog: 
text: As he goes towards cab, some MERRYMAKERS push their way into the
dialog: lobby.
scene_heading: 144 CLOSE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Staring ahead, Henry's words echo like his own death warrant. The
text: merrymakers jostle past him, discussing suntan ointments. Cameron
text: turns and walks across the HOTEL LOBBY and UP the STAIRS...his pace
text: increasing until he is taking them three at a time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 145 CLOSE ON DOOR LOCK
dialog: 
text: Cameron's hand thrusts KEY into the hole, flings open the DOOR TO

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (overwrought)
dialog: Nina...your crazy Eli...
dialog: 
dialog: - 97 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He FREEZES. Over his shoulder, we see Nina, naked, lying on the
text: bed. Raymond, also naked, sits slumped on the edge of the bed,
text: utterly disconsolate. The three stare at each other, an absurd
text: tableau. Cameron whirls and leaves, slamming the door behind him,
text: almost off its hinges.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 146 INT. HOTEL LOBBY
dialog: 
text: He comes down the steps like a madman. Raging, Cameron stomps
text: across the lobby toward the glass doors that will take him out of
text: Eli's grotesque wonderland. He collides with a group of returning
text: night FISHERMEN still in their slickers, carrying their equipment,
text: their catch wrapped in newspapers. For a moment he is tangled in
text: their tackle, FISH TUMBLING AND SLIDING along the marble floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FISHERMAN
dialog: Jesus...don't step on 'em.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Get out of here!
dialog: 
text: Hearing WATER running in the bathtub, he dashes in, but finds the

text: violently that it almost falls off: No Raymond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Get out!!!
dialog: (raging)
dialog: I'll have you thrown out!
dialog: 
text: She crosses to the phone.

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Is there anybody in this whole
dialog: company you haven't screwed?
dialog: 
text: 147A In the HALLWAY, a little group of PASSING TOURISTS turn in

speaker_heading: NINA

dialog: (ironically)
dialog: Then gee, ma'am, I sure hope you
dialog: didn't tell him about all that
dialog: ballin' last night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Don't you dare be clever with me!
text: He came scratching at the door
text: tonight like a beaten dog, begging
dialog: me to say that you were some twenty-

dialog: starts to cry)
dialog: ...and I had to tell him I thought I

speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: You don't have the right to breathe!

speaker_heading: CAMERON

dialog: 
text: He is at a loss for words.

speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)

dialog: You won't turn me into some rotten

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: Okay...okay. I just want to sit a

dialog: say a word. Because if I start
dialog: trying to say, "I'm sorry I caught

scene_heading: 148 INT. BASEMENT SCREENING ROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Dailies are in progress. Eli watches, surrounded by a few crew
text: members. Cameron sits in the back row with Nina's MOTHER, FATHER
text: and SISTER. Nina is not present. On the PORTABLE SCREEN is a shot
text: of Nina as a wild, radiant eighteen-year old Austrian girl running
text: pell-mell along a willow-lined VILLAGE STREET, dodging children and
text: 148A bicycles. She collides with an OLD MAN, her basket falls, its
text: contents scattering; his momentary anger vanishing as he is infected
text: with her joy of life. He helps her refill the basket and she
text: rewards him with a sausage and a kiss. The old man watches her
text: wistfully as she runs away.
scene_heading: 149 ANGLE ON PARENTS
dialog: 
text: There's a tear of pride in Nina's mother's eye. Father gently puts
text: his hand on top of hers as the room lights come on.

dialog: You okay back there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER

dialog: (yelling to
dialog: projectionist)
dialog: Go ahead.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 151 ANGLE ON PORTABLE SCREEN
dialog: 
text: The room dims and the film starts. We see a slate board reading
text: "150A Take 1." The clapper claps and the board is removed,
text: revealing an ATTIC. Nina sprawled on her stomach, stark naked, atop
text: Raymond's naked body, her breasts resting on his chest, her legs
text: apart, interlocked with his. They look directly at the CAMERA
text: awaiting their cue with the calm resignation of two people waiting
text: for the Wilshire bus. The MAKEUP GIRL appears in the shot spraying
text: Nina's back and ass with glycerin sweat from an aerosol can. She
text: disappears as Eli's voice on the sound track calls, "ACTION." The
text: ANGLE TIGHTENS into a less revealing, more artistic composition.
text: Their mouths meet. Their bodies writhe.
scene_heading: 152 CLOSE ON NINA'S PARENTS
dialog: 
text: They stare at the screen in open-mouthed shock and horror. Their
text: once gentle hands grip each other like iron claws, trying to squeeze
dialog: away the nightmare.
scene_heading: 153 ANGLE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: In shock and anger, leaning forward on the edge of his chair,

scene_heading: 156 ANGLE ON PORTABLE SCREEN
dialog: 
text: The lovers convulse with erotic abandon as they approach orgasm.
scene_heading: 157 ANGLE ON NINA'S PARENTS
dialog: 
text: Like a Charles Addams' rendering of a Brady tintype. Their faces
text: wear the stiff frozen smiles of the hopelessly insane.
scene_heading: 158 EXT. MOVIE SET - CLOSE ON NINA
dialog: 
text: She's now made up to look like a woman in her forties. Everything
dialog: about her tells us these have been brutal years, filled with pain
text: and loss. She is reacting in anguish to something O.S. But, even
text: though she manages a few tears, it doesn't quite ring true. Eli
text: steps into the shot.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: God, I don't know what's wrong with

speaker_heading: NINA (CONT'D)
dialog: 
dialog: - 104 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Maybe it's them...I feel like I'm in

speaker_heading: 161 CLOSE ON NINA
dialog: 
dialog: She has not blinked, not turned her heard, for fear that her

speaker_heading: 163 CLOSE ON NINA
dialog: 
text: As she falls apart before our eyes, and an O.S. VOICE on a PLAYBACK
text: TAPE insinuates into our consciousness, echoing as though heard
text: through many loudspeakers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I envy you the pride you must feel
text: today. A young hero has fallen
text: gloriously on the field of battle.
dialog: 
text: Hands reach in and drape a sash around Nina's throat. From it
text: dangles a SWASTIKA. For Nina, there is still no voice, no camera,
text: only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned
text: into her father's memory. And yet, that shame is so similar to the
dialog: shame she should be feeling as the woman in Eli's film at this
text: mockery of her son's death.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: A nation has lost a son! A mother
dialog: has lost a son!
dialog: 
text: The sound has now grown to a proportion reminiscent of those German

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: This sacrifice in blood brings
dialog: closer man's noblest dream...a
dialog: thousand years of peace!
dialog: 
text: The THUNDEROUS SOUND of ten thousand voices shouting: "Sieg Heil!
text: Sieg Heil!" has shattered Nina's isolation. She is now aware that
text: her personal despair has been used to accomplish an acting trick,
text: and it only adds to her degradation and sense of shame, ironically
text: making her performance even more poignant. The crowd on the
text: playback roars with fanatic zeal.

speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I've got

dialog: (to projectionist)
dialog: Get it started.
dialog: 
text: Immediately the lights snap off and the film is projected on the
text: screen. In the dark, the men in the room fumble their way to seats.
text: On the projection screen we see a helicopter SHOT OF THE DUESENBERG
text: APPROACHING THE BRIDGE. Cameron is suddenly alert like a jungle
text: beast who's just heard the trap slam shut behind him. His eyes dart
text: around at the official-looking faces staring at the O.S. film. One
text: face looks disturbingly familiar, but in the dark he can't place it.

speaker_heading: JAKE

scene_heading: 179 INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Partly crated props and costumes, luggage belonging to the departing
text: film crew is piled against the wall and on shelves. In the
text: cavernous half-lit room, Cameron, once again the coiled, stealthy
text: animal, moves through the shadows among the racks of suitcases,
text: pulling them aside, searching. Discovering one, he sets it on the
text: floor. It's locked. With a metal bar, he breaks the lock and
text: eagerly rifles the contents. Then, sensing a presence, he turns.
text: There stands Nina at the base of the steps watching him. With only
text: a glance to her, he goes on with his search.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: How'd you know I was down here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: The desk clerk...
dialog: 
text: He finds a WALLET, opens it, getting to his feet triumphantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: How about that for luck? Burt's
dialog: from Idaho...no picture on the
dialog: driver's license.
dialog: 
text: Cameron stuffs the wallet in his pocket, moving along the row of
text: suitcases. He pulls out a duffel bag, unzips it, shaking the
dialog: 
dialog: - 126 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: contents on the floor. Now with the open bag on his arm, he goes
text: along the row of costumes and props like a man in the supermarket,
text: stuffing in things he will need: a pair of hiking boots, a couple
text: of work shirts, a heavy jacket. Passing a shelf of bayonets, he
text: picks one out and throws it in the bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (ignoring the
dialog: seriousness)
dialog: Name it...
dialog: 
text: Above the bayonets are army helmets. He tries one on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, how's this? A World War One,
dialog: uh...what did they call 'em?...
dialog: dogfaces... somethin'... doughboys.
dialog: (flings a nurses uniform
dialog: at her)
dialog: Wanna be the nurse?
text: 179A From some hospital props, he grabs a wheelchair and shoves it toward
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: ...You tell me this wouldn't work?
text: A pretty nurse pushing a vet in a
dialog: wheelchair? When we hit that

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Who the hell are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Somebody trying to stay
dialog: alive...anybody--that can get past

dialog: (making a shrewd guess)
dialog: Who did Eli say I was?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I'm asking you, God damn...
dialog: 
text: She has fiercely grabbed his naked shoulder.
dialog: 
dialog: - 127 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Easy with that tatoo...it mighta
dialog: lost me Eli, but it won me Lt. Emily
dialog: Schmidt, the greatest boobs in
dialog: Southeast Asia...and a very
dialog: patriotic chick. So I got this
dialog: tattoo, for 28 bucks. And when she
dialog: saw this shoulder, let me tell ya,
dialog: holy Jesus! Following which I got
text: the clap from the Lt. And hepatitis
dialog: from the tattoo needle. You know
dialog: what bothers me? I think Emily is
dialog: gonna be very offended by Eli's
dialog: picture.
dialog: 
text: Nina cannot endure another moment of this charade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Why do they want you? What did you
dialog: do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Eli'd tell you...I was a soldier. I
dialog: did the same as everybody, just one
dialog: of the boys... emptied my M-16 at
dialog: any sound... don't know whether I
dialog: killed gooks or cherries...the new
dialog: kids from the States, we call 'em
dialog: cherries, which they were for maybe
text: fifteen minutes. The dry season is
dialog: when it really breaks loose. You
dialog: get very tired. It's like falling
dialog: asleep at the wheel. You close your
dialog: eyes and it still goes on. You're
dialog: killin' them, they're killin' you.
dialog: Couldn't tell ya now what was real
dialog: except I'm here.
dialog: 
text: We sense in him the fatigue he is describing, then, pushing aside
dialog: that memory.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, once when things were rough and
dialog: the grass ran out, I shot the hell
text: out of a water buffalo.
dialog: (he considers, then passes
dialog: judgment on himself)
dialog: Actually, I wasn't a bad
dialog: soldier...better than most. Got
dialog: lotsa pretty ribbons. Funny...sort
dialog: of like when I did that first stunt
dialog: and everybody started clapping...
dialog: nothing like a slap on the back to
dialog: ruin a man, blow his sense of
dialog: proportion. So, I got home...and,
dialog: uh...I guess I expected something.
dialog: Nothing fancy, but... something, you
dialog: know...a free car wash, double blue
dialog: chip stamps, extra time on the
dialog: parking meter... I don't know...
dialog: Instead, people... uh, didn't seem
dialog: too pleased.
dialog: (trying to hide a lot of
dialog: pain)
dialog: In fact, they acted like I was gonna

speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit. I was supposed to get
dialog: married, run an ice cream parlor.
dialog: (picks up his suitcases)
dialog: I gotta go.
dialog: 
text: 179B Although they're standing only a couple of feet apart, he lifts his
text: hand tentatively, as if to wave goodbye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: ...What about the roadblocks?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I'll go through the woods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Don't you suppose there'll be cops

dialog: 
dialog: - 129 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I suppose there are cops in the
dialog: woodwork! But what the hell...it's
dialog: a nice night.
dialog: (he starts to go)
dialog: 
text: Lovers facing farewells have a gift for suspending time, and Nina
text: speaks out, unable to let him leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I've always liked the woods at
dialog: night. They're very romantic... You
dialog: can hunt for truffles. It might be
dialog: such fun, we'd just keep going.
dialog: 
text: Cameron can't afford to fall for her softness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You said "we." What about your two
dialog: scenes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: That's true...One of them is three
dialog: pages of me making a tunafish salad
dialog: for an American flyer in 1917... And
dialog: I've got to weigh that against
dialog: losing the man I love. It's a big
dialog: decision.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Nina, you're making me crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm a little crazy
dialog: myself. I can't let you go and I
dialog: don't even know who you are.
dialog: (suddenly the dam bursts
dialog: and all self-control is
dialog: gone)
dialog: Why are they chasing you?! What
dialog: have you done? What happens to me
dialog: in the woods? Will I need a bayonet
dialog: too?
text: 179C He stands there, staring at her, his face suddenly savage. After
text: everything, the lady is afraid of him. He picks up the duffel bag
text: and moves for the door, then turns on her, punishing her with his
dialog: words.
dialog: 
dialog: - 130 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: The charge was attempted murder. I
dialog: bashed this cop's head in. It took
dialog: the jury about two fucking minutes.
dialog: It could of been worse. It could of
dialog: been life. But the judge...he
dialog: looked real nice at me, and said you
dialog: were a damn good soldier, son...So
dialog: he only gave me twenty years. No
dialog: way! Enough!...You know how long I
dialog: was in that prison -- nineteen
dialog: months -- and then I was gone! I
dialog: was gone!
dialog: 
text: She stares in shock and horror. His anger is like ice.

dialog: it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: ...Because...
text: 179D Suddenly the ice turns to steam. His self-control shatters like
text: glass. There in the basement of a 100-year old hotel, before an
text: audience of one, Cameron ERUPTS, spewing out the memory of his
text: mortification and crucifixion...not without the silent resignation
text: of Jesus, but with the howling rage of a mad dog...Pluto with the
dialog: rabies...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Because...it seemed like a good
dialog: idea to twist his fucking head off!
dialog: Said I could be his partner when I
dialog: got back...lyin' son of a bitch was
dialog: "real sorry things were slack..."
dialog: Slack my ass...he just didn't want
dialog: me hangin' around because he was
dialog: bangin' my old lady. So I go down
dialog: and start bangin' on his door!

dialog: the mirror)

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
text: ...He's closed. It's two o'clock in
dialog: the morning. I want to smash his

dialog: 
text: 179E Cameron's fist SMASHES his own face in the dressing table mirror.
text: His reflection crazes and falls to pieces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Your hand!
dialog: 
text: Cameron holds up his fist to her, shaking it in glee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Bang! That bright, shiny front
dialog: window went bye-bye!
dialog: (reveling in his own
dialog: insanity)
dialog: ...Maybe he's screwin' her behind
dialog: the counter...I climb in there
dialog: screamin' "WHERE ARE YA? Come out
dialog: here and be a man! Where are ya?
dialog: Behind that counter, you son-of-a-
dialog: bitch?"
dialog: 
text: Cameron kicks over the makeup table as though it were the
text: counter...tubes and glasses shatter all over the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya know what's behind that
dialog: counter?...
dialog: (the ultimate horror)
scene_heading: ...41-DIFFERENT-KINDS-OF-ICE
dialog: CREAM..." and all that fuckin'
dialog: SYRUP!...
dialog: 
text: 179F There is a rainbow row of makeup jars and hair tints. He starts
text: HURLING them against the wall where they smash, punctuating his
text: speech with bursts of gooey color.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: ...And these little Mickey Mouse
text: faces on the walls!...with candy
dialog: eyeballs!...
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: - 132 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: (tense and frightened)
dialog: ...Then...I see this thing glowing
dialog: in the dark...I hit that floor so
dialog: fast. Christ, I nearly swallowed my
dialog: heart. That second I was sure...it
dialog: was Charlie...a cigarette butt, some
dialog: guy on a V.C. Patrol!...
dialog: (his panic subsides)
dialog: Know what it was? It was the
text: GODDAMN PILOT LIGHT ON THE HOT FUDGE
dialog: MACHINE!! That did it! That DID
dialog: IT! HOT FUDGE?! Me buried in shit,
dialog: being the damn good soldier the
dialog: judge said I was, yes sir, people
dialog: sitting there on their fat asses
dialog: feedin' their fat faces. "Can I
dialog: have an extra cherry? Can I have an
dialog: extra cherry?"
dialog: 
text: Cameron rips Denise's electric hair dryer from the wall and hurls it
text: across the basement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: I smashed that fucking fudge pot
text: across the room, smack into that
dialog: shelf full of animals...and it
text: starts raining pussycats and monkeys
dialog: and kangaroo cookies like Noah's
dialog: Ark!
dialog: 
text: The hair dryer smashes against a shelf, toppling ammunition boxes
text: and bottles onto the carcass of a disassembled World War I airplane.
text: The propeller topples and falls through a German recruiting poster,
text: and just out at the Kaiser's crotch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: "How long should a girl wait" she
text: says? FOR GODDAMN EVER, BITCH,
dialog: THAT'S HOW LONG!
dialog: 
text: Cameron's hands have come to rest on a metal laundry bin. He grips
text: it and lifts it over his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: I picked up this fifty-pound ice
text: cream vat...FLAVOR-OF-THE-MONTH!...
scene_heading: ROYAL-BAVARIAN-CHOCOLATE-MIST!...and
dialog: I started running with that son-of-
dialog: a-bitch...
speaker_heading: 179G
dialog: 
dialog: - 133 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Cameron starts running across the room and just as he's about to
text: hurl it, he COLLIDES with a jutting shelf, which knocks him flat on
text: his back. The shelf falls and thirty or forty one-gallon PAINT CANS
text: cascade on top of him. It looks disastrous. Nina runs to him,
text: terrified, but before the last can has even come to rest, Cameron
text: emerges from the pile of cans, throwing them aside, still thrashing
text: and screaming as he struggles to his feet.
dialog: 
text: At the sight of him, Nina starts laughing. But Cameron, who has
text: somehow managed to keep his grip on the laundry basket, raises it
text: over his head as if nothing has happened, hurls the clothes bin,
dialog: screaming:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
text: SCOOP THAT UP YOUR ROYAL BAVARIAN
text: STRAWBERRY SNATCH!
dialog: 
text: With the effort, Cameron's feet fly out from under him as if he had
text: stepped in oil. In fact, he has stepped in paint, and lands flat on
text: his ass in the green goo. Nina "bracks" out an uncontrollable
dialog: guffaw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (bellowing)
dialog: It's not funny!
dialog: 
text: Shamed, Nina runs to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Oh, baby...
dialog: 
text: But, as she reaches him, her feet too are caught in the paint and
text: she slides forward like an ice skater, spraddling him, landing on
text: her ass. His rage vanishes as he points at her, breaking into a
text: fiendish, uncontrollable cackle. These pratfalls are a catharsis
text: that has released the pressure and the madness. They attempt to
text: gain their feet, skidding and sliding in the paint. He succeeds,
text: but Nina fails.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (through laughter)
dialog: Let me go to the bathroom. I'm
dialog: gonna have an accident.
dialog: 
dialog: - 134 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You'll miss the main part! Killer
dialog: Cameron's ghastly crime! I was
dialog: freaked out of my head! And,
dialog: suddenly there's this big flashlight
text: shining in my face. I just grabbed
dialog: that goddamn ice cream bucket and
dialog: slopped it...right over the guy's
dialog: head!
dialog: 
text: Although Cameron's got nothing in his hands, he pantomimes swinging
text: that fifty-pound ice cream bucket around in the air, losing his
text: balance and landing on his back in the paint beside Nina. Her
text: hysteria is renewed, but Cameron stops laughing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It's not funny. It wasn't him. It
dialog: was a cop. I got out of there like
dialog: a shot. I didn't know he was
dialog: knocked out. How the hell did I
dialog: know he was gonna lay there all
text: night with his head in the ice
dialog: cream?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (suddenly serious)
dialog: Oh, my God. He died?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
text: No, he's in the hospital.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Oh, no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Oh, yes. That ice cream's goddamn
dialog: cold!
dialog: (struggling for a proper
dialog: description)
text: His nose...it froze and his ear
dialog: froze, see...and...
dialog: 
text: Despite the horror of it, Nina starts giggling. She can't help it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: No, it's terrible!...He lost the tip
text: of his nose and his ear lobe...
dialog: 
dialog: - 135 -
dialog: 
text: 179H Then, Cameron, realizing the absurdity, starts giggling too. Out of
text: control, Nina scrambles to her feet and dashes for the ladies room.
text: Cameron follows her to the door, still talking as it closes behind
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll tell ya, it's a bad year to
dialog: mess with cops. You get the FBI
dialog: screaming down on your ass...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (through the door)
dialog: Oh, God. Too late...Thanks a lot!
dialog: 
text: Abruptly, Cameron's energy is gone. The hilarity is over. He leans
text: his forehead against the door in exhaustion and despair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (softly)
dialog: ...If we woke up Eli and told him
dialog: about the ice cream...would he
dialog: forgive me and call off the

scene_heading: 180 INT. GARAGE - PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: The DUESENBERG STANDS silhouetted in the darkness, light glinting
text: dimly off it like the gleam from fine wood of a splendid coffin

text: their last respects, it is Cameron and Nina. He is wearing Burt's
dialog: clothes.
dialog: 
text: Nina moves quickly to a WHITE CONVERTIBLE as Cameron crosses to the

scene_heading: 181 EXT. THE OLD ABANDONED ROAD - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: In the stillness, as the morning sun crests the trees, their shadows
text: move like a parting curtain, leaving sunlight to warm the old stones
text: of the abandoned road. The ancient bridge spans the black river,
text: idling toward the sea. It is a perfect day, tranquil except for the
text: faint distant "rumbling" intruding into our consciousness. As it
text: grows louder and LOUDER, a flock of birds is frightened from the
text: trees, a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll
text: from the vibration.
dialog: 
text: Rounding the bend of the road into view are a half-dozen kids on
text: bicycles, peddling furiously, laughing and yelling and looking back
text: at what now appears behind them: the first vehicle of an incredible
dialog: carnival parade -- or is it a funeral procession? Long, short,
text: tall, fat vehicles; the stretch-out car, the cab towing portable
text: toilets, the tractor pulling a generator rig, the Cortez Camper
text: dressing rooms, the stake-bed loaded with reflectors rattling like
text: radar screens, panel trucks with studio emblems, a vintage German
text: army truck filled with soldiers, patrol cars and motorcycles, the
text: huge, bright yellow construction crane on its Caterpillar treads,
text: its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning
text: hard-on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump -- a few technicians
text: straddle it having their morning Danish and coffee. In the midst of
text: these, on a low-slung flatbed trailer rides the Duesenberg -- the
text: coffin on its caisson.
dialog: 
text: The caravan grinds, hisses, wheezes to a halt and the A.D., astride
text: the hood of the first vehicle, dismounts and raises his electric
text: bullhorn to begin what will be an incessant squawking of

dialog: 
scene_heading: 190 CLOSE ON DUESENBERG
dialog: 
text: Cameron walks around it, testing and checking, but moving

dialog: How do you guys get accident

dialog: 
text: 190A They've reached the truck where Jake stands proudly. The Property

scene_heading: 191 ANGLE ON DUESENBERG'S TRUNK
dialog: 
text: As Cameron arrives and casually leans against the trunk and then

speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, bump it once.

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (by reflex)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: The words "CAMERA ON" sound exactly like "CAMERON." It sounded as
dialog: though his real name was called and he automatically answered. Has
text: his identity been exposed? His eyes widen. The technician, getting
text: no response, calls to Jake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Ask him if it's on?

dialog: Hey, they wanna know is the CAMERA
dialog: ON?
dialog: 
text: Cameron realizes his error, but it's too late, he's in a panic. In
text: his mind, he's given himself away. The road ahead is clear -- GO!
text: He jams the car in gear and slams the accelerator to the floor. The
text: Duesenberg leaps forward, screeching wildly. In its wake -- chaos.
text: Everyone running, yelling...

dialog: Yahooo!
dialog: (toward Nina in the

dialog: Hang on to everything, baby, we're

dialog: 
text: The needle hits eighty -- eighty-five. Ahead, the bridge is rushing
text: toward us. Now the arches of the stone railing are strobing past.
text: Through them, he sees the black river which he has escaped.
text: Triumphantly, his hand rises, middle finger extended. Suddenly the
text: red camera light goes on, the underwater camera behind him begins
text: whirring. He moves his finger behind him for a perfect close-up,
dialog: (recalling that moment in the tower):
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON

dialog: Shoot this, Eli!
dialog: 
text: The center of the bridge is an instant away, an approaching blur.

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Blam! The whole front wheel of the car is blown off by an explosive

speaker_heading: 196 ANOTHER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: The Duesenberg drops on one axle. Metal screams against stone, as
text: though it were Cameron himself, screaming. Skidding, spinning,
text: tearing through the papier-mache railing, plunging out of control
text: into space, where it hovers for a brief instant and arcs downward
text: like a dying bird.
scene_heading: 197 INT. DUESENBERG - CLOSE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: A cry of such anguish and despair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Ninaaa-a-a-a-a-!!!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 198 INT. DUESENBERG - WIDE ANGLE PAST CAMERON THROUGH WINDSHIELD
dialog: 
text: The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening,
text: shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and
text: soundless world -- except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera
text: and Cameron's desperate cries. Tearing his seatbelt off he flings
text: himself toward the rear of the car, clawing at the back seat to
text: reach Nina. Incredibly, there is sunlight again as the car is
text: buoyed to the surface. There, again, is the living world - the
text: road, the trees. In that brief instant, through the rear window,
text: Cameron has a wild, tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore -- Nina,
text: standing by the rail looking down, Eli beside her. The car noses
text: downward, water rising swiftly over the rear window. The last image
text: on Cameron's retina is that wild, eager, little-girl excitement on
text: Nina's face. Then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water
text: as the car plunges toward the bottom.
dialog: 
text: Cameron sits, immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is
dialog: total. Everyone, even Nina, has conspired to bring him to this --
text: red light glowing, camera whirring, to capture the moment of his
dialog: death.
dialog: 
dialog: - 150 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Outrage galvanizes him to action. He reaches for the door handles,
text: to rip them open -- they snap off in his hands. Now there is a
text: rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode,
text: crushing down toward him. Under the immense pressure, the rear
text: window bursts inward, the river rushing in a wild torrent. The
text: memory of Chuck's voice..."the windows." He lowers the front window
text: slowly. The water now pours in faster. The level has risen to his
text: chin. He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head.
text: Still the red light burns. He reaches beneath the seat for the
text: oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose. It won't move. The
text: impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame. His
text: groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask. A hope. Though every
text: second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are
text: as in slow motion. Pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager
text: breath and chokes as water fills his mouth. The rubber tube has
text: broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must
text: have with Burt. Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the
text: water reaches the roof. For a moment there is a strange stillness
text: which Cameron, his lungs bursting, swims through, out the window and
text: toward the surface.
scene_heading: 199 ANGLE ON CAMERON
dialog: 
text: Moving upward through river slime, in a world that grows lighter, in
text: a desperate race to reach air.
dialog: 
text: Daylight! Gasping, half unconscious, barely able to move his arms
text: to stay afloat. Adrift in the current, he touches land, clawing at
text: the rocks and pulling himself onto the shore. His muscles, still
text: moving by motor reflex, driven by survival instinct, take him
text: crawling from the river bank through the tall grass -- still the
text: fugitive, the "man on the run." Then, he lifts his head and stops
text: at what he sees before him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 200 POV
dialog: 
text: Fanned out across the field is a row of men, guns held ready.
text: Policemen from the truck in their German uniforms moving forward
text: slowly -- carefully searching the terrain in an arch which, as it
text: closes, must irrevocably reach Cameron.
speaker_heading: 201 ANOTHER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: It's over. Without strength or will, he lies waiting for them as
text: though his eyes were made of glass. They see him now, but their
text: pace doesn't change. As they take the last few steps toward him, he
text: sees their shoulders, waists, knees and then only a circle of feet
text: around him.
dialog: 
text: Their hands roughly grab him, pulling him to his feet, shoving him
text: brutally about. Angry cop faced growling: "Kill the son-of-a-
dialog: 
dialog: - 151 -
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: bitch," "Shoot 'im," "Cut it," "Hang 'im," and then loudly, "Cut
text: it!" He feels a blow on the back, then another. They seem too
text: gentle. Why is that cop smiling? Some of them are walking away.
text: Where are the handcuffs? Why is he shaking my hand instead? Then
text: the jumble of voices is becoming clearer..."No matter what they pay
dialog: you, make 'em give you a raise!"..."Fantastic, my wife thinks being
dialog: a cop is dangerous -- you guys are terrific!" It finally sinks in,
text: the insane, absurd, devastating, humiliating realization that it was
text: all just another scene in a movie that came off as planned.
dialog: 
text: He is alive and free. Is that gurgle we hear in Cameron's throat
text: the water that he swallowed or an unseemly giggle? Then it chokes
text: into laughter.
speaker_heading: 202 POV
dialog: 
text: Here comes Chuck, running across the field with his silly stunt bag
dialog: filled with elastic bandages. How funny. Here's the helicopter
text: hovering with Gabe descending the rope ladder bearing film for Eli,
text: who runs to meet him. How hilarious. There's the pink
text: pinafore...Nina holding the skirt up to her waist as she wades
text: through the tall grass towards him. How sweetly absurd.
