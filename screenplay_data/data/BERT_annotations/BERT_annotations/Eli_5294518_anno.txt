text: The hallway feels endless. There’s no escape.
text: We TRIP, fall down. We’re dazed for a moment. We HEAR

scene_heading: INT. PLASTIC TENT/MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: ELI (11) BOLTS AWAKE from his nightmare. His face is pale,
text: big bags under his eyes. He’s choking on air, wheezing
text: uncontrollably. He can’t get a breath.
text: He looks around frantically. He’s inside his plastic tent,
text: used to quarantine him from his surroundings. The walls are
text: opaque and the room outside looks foggy.
text: There’s a A LOUD HUMMING SOUND, an air purifier pumping clean
text: air into the tent from a hose.
text: Eli himself is wearing A SANITARY FACE MASK. His bed has been
text: stripped of the motel supplied sheets and comforter and
text: replaced with a special hypo-allergenic kind.
text: A DARK SHAPE approaches the tent wall. But an angelic voice
text: whispers into the tent...
speaker_heading: MOM (0.S.)
dialog: (soothing)
dialog: Breath honey, it’s okay. You’re
dialog: okay.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (wheezing)
dialog: Dust...there’s dust!
speaker_heading: MOM (0.S.)
dialog: It was just a bad dream. There’s no

speaker_heading: MOM (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember what we practiced, in one-
dialog: two, out one-two, in one-two, out
dialog: one-two.
dialog: Eli does as Mom directs. It’s a tried and true practice. He
text: takes a breath, holds, and releases.
text: As Eli does his breathing, Mom sings softly to him:
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: You are my sunshine, my only
dialog: sunshine. You make me happy, when
text: skies are grey...
text: The simple breathing technique works. He calms down.
text: WE REVEAL THE MOTEL ROOM from OUTSIDE THE TENT for the first
text: time. It’s a dingy roadside motel room, the kind where the
text: most modern appliance is a ten year old TV.
text: Mom stands just outside the tent, places her hand up against
text: the plastic wall. She’s in her mid 40s, midwestern Mom
text: attractive - but tired, frayed. She has a name, but if Eli
dialog: doesn’t use it then neither do we.
text: The plastic tent is less than an eighth on an inch thick, but
text: the separation between Eli and Mom feels huge.
text: A LIGHT CLICKS ON. It’s Dad, laying in the twin bed next to
text: the tent. He’s also mid 40s, in shape, goatee.
text: He removes a sleep mask to reveal eyes puffy with sleep, puts
text: on his glasses next to the nightstand. The clock says 6:00am.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Fire or dog?
text: Eli responds from inside the tent.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Fire.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I’m fine.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Of course you are, champ.
text: But the look on Eli’s face says he’s pretty far from okay.

scene_heading: CUT TO: ELI CHANGES CLOTHES
text: He pulls out a FRESH T-SHIRT from out of A VACUUM SEALED BAG.
dialog: Tosses it on.
scene_heading: CUT TO: ELI GETS INTO HIS GERM-FREE SUIT
text: It’s basically a full body HAZMAT SUIT, colored BRIGHT
text: YELLOW. Eli steps into the suit - far from thrilling. The
text: zipper’s on the inside and Eli ZIPS HIMSELF UP.
speaker_heading: END MONTAGE
text: Now that Eli’s finished, he’s ready to leave the tent. The
text: fingers on his suit are too bulky work the zipper though, so

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: All zipped up?
speaker_heading: ELI

text: It’s a local motel in a small town. There’s TWO DELINQUENT
text: LOOKING TEENAGERS skateboarding in the parking lot.
text: Dad pulls the car around, a late model luxury SUV, a car you
dialog: only buy if you can afford the seventy-five dollars a week it
text: costs to fill the gas tank. There’s suitcases tied to the
text: roof. He honks the horn.
text: The motel room door opens and Mom steps out, a few suitcases
text: in her hand. She shoots a nervous glance at the DELINQUENT
text: TEENAGERS, keeps moving.
text: Dad gets out and starts loading the luggage.
text: Eli hasn't left the motel room yet. Mom turns back.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Come on, Eli. Let’s go.
text: Dad shuts the trunk.
text: Slowly, Eli peeks his head out from the motel room into the
text: harsh daylight. We see his sickly face through the plastic

text: He looks at the outside world like frightened prey. To Eli,
dialog: this beautiful summer day is terrifying.
text: Dad comes around to the back passenger side door.
speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Eli leaps into the backseat and Dad shuts the door quickly.

text: They CRACK THEMSELVES UP.

scene_heading: EXT. WINDY COLORADO HIGHWAY - DAY

scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY

text: INSERT ON DRAWING: an image of himself on a skateboard, still

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: How you feeling honey?
text: Eli doesn’t respond. Dad keeps jamming away.
text: SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRATCH. His face begins to tighten up. His
text: jaw clenches.
scene_heading: SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRA---. The colored pencil tip snaps. Eli
text: throws the pencil on the seat next to him in frustration. It
text: lands amid a collection of other broken colored pencils.
text: Mom shuts the music off abruptly. Surprises Dad.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Hey...!
text: Mom gives Dad a stern look. She notices Eli in the back.

dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Excited to finally be done with all

text: Mom’s about to say something else when Eli cuts her off.
speaker_heading: ELI

scene_heading: EXT. ISOLATED ROCKY ROAD/INT. MOM’S CAR - DAY - LATER
text: Dad pulls off the main road onto a smaller, rocky road.
text: Eli’s moved on from drawing and is now reading a book on his
text: IPAD. As Eli flips the (electronic) pages, we realize what
text: he’s reading because of the illustrations. It’s PINNOCHIO.
text: They pass by A DILAPIDATED COTTAGE with an old red paint job
text: bleached years over from sunlight and harsh weather. There's
text: A LITTLE GIRL balancing herself on an old wooden fence.
text: She immediately catches Eli’s eye. He puts the iPad down.
text: The little girl is roughly Eli’s age and her hair is a fiery
text: red; her hand-me-down dress thoroughly worn.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Didn't realize we had neighbors.
text: She moves across the old fence, arms outstretched to balance
text: herself. Eli’s eyes are glued to her. But in a moment, the

speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Turn here.

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Hmm. Should we knock or do you
dialog: think there’s a doorbell--
text: Dad is interrupted by a FEMALE VOICE, friendly but firm, from
text: a speaker near the door. There’s a small camera above it.
speaker_heading: VOICE/DR. HORN (0.S.)
dialog: Hello, Miller family. I’m Dr. Horn.
dialog: Apologies for the formal

speaker_heading: DR. HORN (0.S.)
dialog: Don’t worry, Eli. There’s nothing
dialog: to be afraid of. Just a few
dialog: precautionary measures to keep this
dialog: clean house clean. Okay, I’m going
dialog: to open the door just enough for
dialog: you to enter, and I ask that you
dialog: enter as quickly as possible. We
dialog: want as little of the outside in as

text: Eli holds on tighter to Mom.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It’s okay, honey. Remember, this is

scene_heading: INT. DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER — CONTINUOUS

dialog: Eli’s totally freaked, as would anyone.
text: Dr. Horn’s voice comes out of another speaker.

text: Regardless of Dr. Horn’s preamble, it still startles Eli.

dialog: Now for the lights.
text: A blinding bright light goes on, and Eli’s vision whites-out.
text: It almost brings him to his knees.
text: But moments later the lights shut off and the humming ceases.
text: The steel door in front of him begins to slide open.
text: Eli’s vision is still blurry from the lights and he can’t

text: The steel door finishes opening and Eli can make out a fuzzy
text: shape standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: DR. HORN (CONT'D)
dialog: Right this way, Eli.
text: The shape comes into focus. It’s DR. ISABELLA HORN (early
dialog: 50s), in the flesh finally. We immediately get the sense that
text: she has bigger things on her mind than her appearance: she
text: wears neutral colored clothing and her hair is years uncut,
text: tied back in a ponytail. She flashes a warm, inviting smile.

dialog: On purpose. Although everything

text: Eli walks up to what once was a fireplace, but is now
text: cemented over. But Eli’s eyes are drawn to what’s hanging

speaker_heading: DR. HORN
dialog: At the end is my room. This is my

text: Dr. Horn opens the door to THE LIBRARY. Eli and Mom observe

speaker_heading: DR. HORN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DR. HORN
dialog: Why don’t you have a seat here.

text: and sits on the medical bench in the center of the room.
text: Dr. Horn pulls out a digital camera.
speaker_heading: DR. HORN (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m going to get a picture for my

speaker_heading: DR. HORN (CONT’D)
dialog: Perfect. Let’s get started.

text: Mom carefully removes the lead wires attached to Eli.
speaker_heading: DR. HORN (CONT’D)
dialog: Can you flip onto your stomach?
text: Eli obeys. Dr. Horn moves behind Eli, wheels a medical tray
text: along with her. He can see her reflection in the glass
text: cabinet in front of him.
speaker_heading: DR. HORN (CONT’D)
dialog: In a normal healthy body,
dialog: antibodies are produced by a gene
text: found within the bone marrow. But
dialog: in your case, the gene that
dialog: produces those antibodies
text: malfunctions and ceases production.
text: Through the reflection Eli can see Dr. Horn removing items
text: from packaging on the medical tray, but his own reflection
text: obscures what the items actually are.
speaker_heading: DR. HORN (CONT’D)
dialog: That means the first step to curing
dialog: you is isolating the gene, and
dialog: figuring out how to make it
dialog: function again. In order to do
dialog: that, I have to harvest the marrow.
dialog: The procedure takes up to an hour,
dialog: so I’m going to give you a general
dialog: anaesthetic which will put you to
dialog: sleep. When you wake up you’ll feel
dialog: groggy, and you might be nauseous
dialog: which is absolutely normal. Nothing
dialog: to worry about.
text: In the reflection Eli sees Dr. Horn raise a large hypodermic
text: needle. Eli grabs Mom’s hand, grips so tightly it hurts her.
speaker_heading: DR. HORN (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay, I want you to count back from
dialog: one hundred for me, okay. You’re

text: Ever so faintly he can make out:
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: Now that’s a good ‘un!

text: THE LITTLE NEIGHBOR GIRL is about twenty yards away playing
text: in the stream. She stands ankle deep in the water, next to

text: She goes back to staring intently into the water, searching,
text: then she suddenly LUNGES into the water with her hands, like
text: she’s grabbing something.
text: Eli stares at her, totally transfixed when -- SHE TURNS TO

speaker_heading: HALEY

dialog: That’s great.
speaker_heading: DR. HORN
dialog: Yes, but that’s the easy part. I’m

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: And then he’s cured?
speaker_heading: DR. HORN
dialog: Unfortunately not. The process is

scene_heading: INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Eli quietly shuts the door to his room so he isn’t heard. He
text: lies down on his bed.
text: He picks up his iPad and looks at the home screen. The
text: background is a FAMILY PHOTO taken from when Eli was just a
dialog: baby: Baby Eli, Mom and Dad, even Prince The Dog, posing,
dialog: looking happy. Nobody with any clue that life would throw
dialog: them such a curveball.
text: Eli begins to tear up...
text: .-.-But he has no clue the horrific events unfolding just
text: beneath him...
text: FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME, and without a decibel of sound,
text: THREE GHOSTS, gaunt and horrific, slither their way towards
text: Eli's bed on their bellies. One of them is a BALD MAN, the
text: other is THE LONG HAIRED WOMAN (from earlier) and the final
text: ghost _is an ELDERLY GAUNT MAN.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Eli stares at the picture, his mind someplace else...
text: The Ghosts slither underneath Eli's bed and disappear.
text: Suddenly, there’s a BUMP underneath Eli’s bed. It startles
text: him. His pulse begins to race. He bends over the bed, looks
text: down, but it’s too dark to see anything.
text: He uses the iPad next to him like a flashlight and with bated
text: breath, peers underneath his bed.
text: There's nothing there. The light shines clear through to the
text: other side. Eli lifts himself back up onto the bed, still
text: spooked, still unsure.
text: The bed shudders hard. Eli clamps down onto the comforter.
text: The iPad falls to the floor, flashlight pointing up.
text: CLOSE ON: The legs of the bed frame. They lift straight off
dialog: the ground.
text: Eli feels it, holds onto the comforter as if it provides some
text: sort of stability. The bed rises further up: six inches off
dialog: the ground...a foot...a foot and half...

text: Eli knows it’s time to move. He focuses in on the door - his
text: exit. Leaps off the bed and races for the door.
text: He swings the door wide and standing before him is the YOUNG
text: BOY. The same boy we caught a glimpse of entering the
text: computer room, but now we see him in full view. He’s no older
text: than Eli, his stringy blonde hair hangs off the Dead Boy’s
text: face, which is locked in a pained expression.
dialog: 
text: Eli startles so bad he falls to the floor. The Dead Boy
text: advances on him, Eli scrambles backwards.
text: The Dead Boy keeps coming, his eyes little black abysses
text: burrowed into a colorless face. Eli keeps moving back when
text: suddenly The Dead Boy stops, looks up.
text: Eli realizes with a sinking feeling what The Dead Boy is
text: looking at...the bed floats a few feet above his head.
dialog: 
text: There’s not even a second for Eli to move out of the way
text: before the bed comes crashing to the floor.
text: Silence. The room is still, no ghosts, no movement
dialog: whatsoever. Is Eli a goner...?
dialog: 
text: No. UNDERNEATH THE BED we find Eli, lying flat on his back,
text: the bottom of the bed frame mere inches away from his nose.
text: He turns to look -- one of the frame’s legs landed on top of
text: his iPad, smashing the screen but giving Eli the life saving
dialog: inches he needed.
text: Eli breathes for a beat, gathers himself, and notices
text: something directly above him...
text: Etched into a wooden slat above him is a crudely written
dialog: number: 5-1-6-6...

text: Eli watches Dr. Horn’s fingers tap the keypad. An idea clicks

text: angle, it damn sure looks like her fingers hit 5-1-6-6.
text: The red light turns to green and Dr. Horn opens the door.

text: She starts rifling through it.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: HALEY
dialog: What’s it look like? I’m setting up

text: Haley's red tent is fully set up now, the opening flush

text: He debates for a beat, then knocks on the window to wake her.
text: She bolts up, surprised.

text: He creeps up the stairs, careful not to make too much noise.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY/OUTSIDE DR. HORN’S WING - NIGHT
text: He reaches the top of the staircase. Even darker here.
text: Eli finds Dr. Horn’s door with the light, moves towards it.
text: He takes a deep breath, hovers over the keypad. If the code
dialog: is right, this changes everything.
text: He enters the code slowly: 5...1...6...6. The split second
text: before the light goes from red to green feels like an
text: eternity. But the code works, the surprise shows on his face.
text: The door audibly unlocks - loud in the silence. Eli freezes.
text: Now what? Eli hesitates a beat, does he dare enter? Yes. He
text: gently pulls open the door and enters Dr. Horn’s Wing.
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE DR. HORN’S WING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Eli very quietly shuts the door. He looks around.
text: He shines the light into the library, nothing in there but a
text: lot of bookshelves.
text: Dr. Horn’s room is shut, but the Exam Room door is open.
text: Eli holds here for a moment, shines the flashlight on Dr.
text: Horn’s room, wonders if Dr. Horn might still be awake inside.
text: It’s too late for that now though, he’s already here.
text: He enters the patient’s room, and shuts the door behind him.
text: WE HOLD on Dr. Horn’s door. From beneath the door frame WE
text: SEE _a light turn on.
scene_heading: INT. EXAM ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Eli shines the flashlight around the room. Although we’ve
text: seen it before, it’s menacing in the darkness.
text: There’s a medical cabinet close by, Eli opens it. There’s the
dialog: usual first aid supplies, various medical instruments, some
dialog: pill bottles, but nothing that would help Eli.
text: Finally, at the far end of the room, Eli reaches Dr. Horn’s
text: desk. He scans the flashlight over it.
dialog: Time to check the drawers.
scene_heading: 8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE
scene_heading: FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
dialog: 59.
text: He tries the top two smaller drawers of the desk but there’s
text: nothing there but various office materials.
text: He tries the larger left bottom drawer. It’s empty.
text: Finally, Eli tries the last drawer, but when he pulls on it,
text: it won’t open. He tries again, still nothing.
text: He shines his flashlight on the side of the drawer and
text: discovers a lock.
text: Eli scans the surface of the desk with the flashlight,
dialog: searching for the key. It’s not there, and Dr. Horn wouldn’t
dialog: be foolish enough to leave it anywhere Eli could get to it.
text: But something inside a pen container reflects the light of
text: Eli's flashlight. It’s a letter opener. He removes it,
text: examines the tip, the wheels in his head spinning.
text: He examines the lock again. It’s cheap, came with the desk
text: and made to fit one of those thin metal keys.
text: Eli takes the letter opener and inserts it slowly into the
text: keyhole until it stops. He tries to twist, but nothing
text: happens. He readjusts the letter opener, pulling it out
text: slightly and tries again.
dialog: This time, wouldn’t you know it, the lock gives.
text: He tries the drawer and it opens smoothly. Eli smiles, quite
text: pleased with himself.
text: Inside the drawer is a hanging file cabinet. He pulls out the
text: first file. It’s a manila folder with his name written on it.
text: He opens the folder, flips through it. Lots of handwritten
text: notes, most of them written in doctor’s chicken-scratch. It’s
dialog: impossible to read, except for the headings, which can be
text: made out clearly.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Treatment One....Treatment
dialog: 2....Treatment 3...
text: He reaches the end, and the last page contains a typed
dialog: document listing Eli’s specs: hair, weight, eye color, etc.
text: There's a_ small photo of him stapled to the corner.
dialog: 
text: Eli goes back into the drawer for more, but Eli’s folder is
dialog: the only thing there.
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are the rest of them?

text: There’s a strange noise from the other side of the room. Eli
text: whirls around, shines his flashlight at the source. There’s
text: nothing there. Eli’s about to turn back around when...
text: A HAND REACHES UP FROM THE OPEN DRAWER AND GRABS HIM! Eli
text: SCREAMS, his whole body lurches forward off balance, falls
text: into the open drawer.
dialog: 
text: Something beneath his hand shifts inside the drawer and Eli
text: hits something solid. He pulls his hand out from the drawer
text: and gathers himself. There’s no one else there.
text: He looks back inside the drawer and realizes the drawer had a
text: false bottom. He moves the false bottom away to reveal
text: another stack of folders.
text: Eli pulls the stack out and lays them on the desk. The top
text: folder is labeled “PERRY HENDERSON.” He opens it up. More
text: illegible chicken scratch except for the headings:
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT’D)
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Treatment One...Treatment Four.
text: He flips to the last page, the specs page.
text: His eyes go wide...
dialog: The photo is Perry. And Perry is The Dead Boy that’s been
dialog: haunting him.
dialog: 
text: He quickly flips through the other folders. WE SEE THE
text: PICTURES OF THE PATIENTS, three of them have turned up as
text: ghosts so far: HELENA (The Long Haired Woman), VICTOR (The
text: Elderly Man) and HARRIS (The Bald Man).
text: There's a noise from outside the door. But this isn’t the
text: noise of a ghost -- it’s the sound of Dr. Horn opening her
text: bedroom door! She must've heard Eli scream.
dialog: 
text: It startles Eli. The folders slip out of his hands, spill
text: onto the floor.
text: WE HEAR her FOOTSTEPS coming towards the room - THUMP, THUMP,
text: THUMP, THUMP...
text: Eli scrambles into action. He rushes to pick up the folders.
text: ...THUMP, THUMP, THUMP, THUMP...
text: He tries to remember which order they were in. Arranges them.

text: ..-THUMP, THUMP, THUMP. THE FOOTSTEPS STOP. THE DOOR OPENS.
text: Eli ducks under the desk, the closest place, and only, place
text: to hide. Clicks off his flashlight nick of time. He HEARS the
text: door creak open, Dr. Horn sticking her head in:
speaker_heading: DR. HORN (0.S.)
dialog: Hello? Anybody in here?
text: Dr. Horn enters the room, turns on the lights.
speaker_heading: DR. HORN (CONT’D)
dialog: Eli, is that you?
text: From her perspective, the room looks empty, just as she left
text: it. She enters the room anyway.
text: Eli squeezes himself into the corner as tightly as
dialog: possible...
text: And realizes the letter opener still sticks out of the cheap
text: drawer lock. Dr. Horn moves around the room slowly, snooping,
text: but she hasn’t noticed the drawer yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. HORN (CONT’D)
dialog: If you’re in here, Eli, it’s okay.
dialog: I won't be mad.
text: Eli very deliberately grabs onto the letter opener and twists
text: to lock it. He barely snatches the letter opener back in time
text: before Dr. Horn is at the desk.
text: Without bending over, she reaches down and tries that very
text: drawer. Eli tenses, certain she’s going to spot him...
text: But the drawer doesn’t budge, apparently satisfying Dr. Horn.
text: She turns to leave without more fuss and turns the light off
text: on her way out.

dialog: 
text: Eli gasps, startled. His hand shakes with fear, but he

text: He keeps the quivering beam trained on the closet door, waits
dialog: for something to happen...but nothing does. He’s going to
dialog: have to open the door himself.

speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
text: There’s no response, as if Eli ever expected one. With a
text: shaky hand, he places his hand on the doorknob, holds it

dialog: the door wide when...
text: SKREEK! The sound of something heavy moving across the floor
text: behind him.
text: Eli whirls around, shines the flashlight onto the bookcase.
text: It’s been moved, about six inches away from the wall. Eli
text: steps towards it...
text: SKREEK! It MOVES again, this time in full view of Eli. He
text: jumps back, surprised. The bookcase begins to rattle.
text: It’s a heavy wooden bookcase, the power with which it shakes
text: is intimidating. Books begin to fall from the shelves. Eli
text: has to stand back, the bookcase rocks more violently now.
text: The shelves are empty of books now, the last ones crashing to
text: the floor, and with one final shutter it tips over. It lands
text: facedown with a HEARTY THUD.
text: Eli doesn’t know what to do at first, waits for something
text: more to happen. Nothing does. He shines his light over the
text: fallen bookcase and realizes:
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT’D)
dialog: Is this...are you trying to tell me

text: She’s worried.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It’s okay. It was an accident.

text: Eli slips into the library, constantly watching his back.
text: There’s no door so there’s no way of concealing what he’s
dialog: doing.
text: He immediately goes to THE OAK DESK located in the corner of
dialog: the room. He had luck with the last desk he tried, so why not
dialog: again here.
text: There’s nothing on the surface of the desk except a desk lamp
text: and some meaningless knickknacks. He tries the drawers:
dialog: one...two...three...four...they’re all empty, they’re all
text: unlocked, and there’s no false bottoms. There are no secrets
dialog: to be found here.
text: He turns his attention to the bookcases. He’s growing antsy.
text: He doesn’t know what to look for, and time is of the essence.
text: The door to the exam room is still shut, so his parents
dialog: haven't left yet. But they could open it up any second.
text: Eli walks the perimeter of the bookcases, scanning the books,
dialog: looking for anything unusual. But it’s all just old medical
dialog: texts and publications.
text: He balls his hands up into fists, his unease turning into
text: frustration. He moves along the bookcases faster, searching,
dialog: searching.
text: He talks to himself, but also perhaps, The Ghosts.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (angry)
dialog: What am I supposed to find?
text: Maybe it’s the bookcases themselves! He goes to the one on

speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on. There has to be something.
text: Eli’s downright manic at this point, exasperated. He starts
text: to pull at the books on the shelves, perhaps hoping to find

text: He finds nothing. He starts tearing down the books off their

text: And in the brief moment before Dad strong-arms him into The

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: ELI

dialog: No...please...she wants to...kill
dialog: me!

text: And suddenly, Eli sees not a tough country girl before him,

speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Haley, I’m sorry. Don’t cry. I

text: In place of a bed there’s an army style cot, nothing more

dialog:

speaker_heading: DR. HORN
dialog: Eli, there’s so much you don’t

speaker_heading: DR. HORN (CONT’D)
dialog: Grant this boy your forgiveness
