text: A BRIGHT LIGHT IS SWITCHED ON REVEALING:
text: JUNE HOLYFIELD. Late twenties. Squinting. Seated at a
text: metal table. Handcuffed. Her clothing is torn; her face
text: cut, streaked with dirt.
text: A DOOR OPENS OS. FOOTSTEPS. A MAN, his appearance hidden in
text: shadow, pulls out the chair across from her and sits down.
text: We sense there are others in the room as well. He tosses a
text: passport on the table in front of her.
speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Yes. Who are~-
text: The Man points a GUN at her.
speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Honestly? I’m not entirely sure.
dialog: It just felt like something I had
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Who is John Milner to you?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You don’t know how many times I’ve
dialog: asked myself that question this

dialog: drastic steps to get where you're
dialog: supposed to be--
text: The man puts a gun to her head.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Why. Are. You. Here?

speaker_heading: JUNE

text: We HEAR AN ALARM CLOCK OVER...
scene_heading: FADE IN: JUNE’S BEDROOM - DAWN
text: June awakens, shuts off the alarm. She sits up, stretches.
text: Sighs.
scene_heading: INT. JUNE’S CLOSET - DAWN
text: Rows of sensible shoes and accessories line the meticulously
text: organized closet. June searches through the racks of
text: tasteful-yet-bland dresses, selects the tasteful-yet-bland
dialog: dress of the day.
scene_heading: EXT. STARBUCKS - DAWN
text: June exits balancing the tray of coffees in one hand and
text: several bags of muffins in the other. IT STARTS RAINING as
text: she loads them into her TOYOTA COROLLA.
scene_heading: INT. JUNE’S CAR - SAME
text: As she drives, listening to an ITALIAN LANGUAGE INSTRUCTIONAL
text: TAPE, repeating after it.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Io vado prendere il pesce...
scene_heading: EXT. FIDELITY INVESTMENTS BUILDING - MORNING
text: POURING RAIN. June is the only one mounting the front steps
text: for the entrance. It’s still that early.
dialog: pnp.
scene_heading: INT. JUNE’S FLOOR - MORNING
text: June steps off the elevator, zigzags her way through a huge
text: bullpen of still-empty cubicles. Placing a coffee in one, a
dialog: muffin in another...
text: She gets to a corner of the floor, a GLASSED-IN OFFICE there.
text: She goes into the office, sets coffee and a muffin down on
text: the desk. Carefully straightens the papers there.
text: June sets the last coffee down at her desk (right outside the
text: glassed-in office), sits down and “straps in”: puts on her
text: telephone headset, her Carpal Tunnel wrist guards, takes a
text: water bottle from her purse, sets it on the clean desk, and
text: starts typing on the computer.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - WIDE SHOT - LATER
text: As people begin filing in for work. Those that find coffees

speaker_heading: MR. HEARN

speaker_heading: JUNE

speaker_heading: MR. HEARN

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: It's... wait, what?
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
text: The inkjet color toner cartridge.
dialog: The one my printer needs. The one
dialog: I told you about.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: On the way here. I e-mailed you.
dialog: I said I needed it taken care of
dialog: before I got to the office.
dialog: Before.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I’m sorry. I haven’t had a chance
dialog: to check my e-mail in the last few
dialog: minutes.
text: Mr. Hearn sighs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: June, do you know how replaceable I
dialog: am?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: There are at least five hundred
dialog: thousand people out there who could
dialog: do my job better than me.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I wouldn’t say that--
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: It’s true. They’re younger,
dialog: smarter, better looking. So I need
dialog: everyone on my staff to be on the
dialog: ball, to do their jobs well, ‘cause
dialog: it makes me look better than I
dialog: actually am. Understand?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: Good. Because, June, we're all
dialog: replaceable.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I‘'1ll get the toner cartridge.
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: You do that.
text: He heads into his office. June looks around at the others in
text: the office, who stare. They quickly turn back to their work,
dialog: embarrassed.
scene_heading: INT. JUNE'S MOM’S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The place is a warm and comfortable mess -- colorful,
text: mismatched furniture, funky tchotchkes -- the opposite of
text: June’s condo.
text: In the midst of the clutter, JUNE’S MOM happily packs up a
text: suitcase. June bursts through the door carrying two arm-
text: fulls of groceries.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: I’m going to be late getting back
dialog: to work. I had to go to three
dialog: stores to get your fiber.
dialog: Remember, you've got to take it
dialog: twice a day.
text: She starts hurriedly putting the groceries away in the
text: cabinets and fridge, then notices her mom packing.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (wary)
dialog: You going somewhere?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE’S’ MOM
dialog: Nevada.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: JUNE’S MOM
dialog: Burning Man.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Burning Man? The festival?
speaker_heading: JUNE’S MOM
dialog: Mm-hmm. I read about it in the
dialog: paper this morning, and it looks
dialog: amazing.
text: June steps between her mother and the suitcase.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Mom, you can‘t keep doing this to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JUNE’'S MOM
dialog: I’m not doing anything to you,
dialog: June. I’m just living my life.
dialog: Try it. It’s fun.
text: She steps around her daughter and continues packing.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Look, just because. I don’t choose
dialog: to live my life like a carny
dialog: doesn’t make it any less
dialog: satisfying.
speaker_heading: JUNE’S MOM
dialog: Some people are perfectly happy
dialog: being an assistant at Fidelity
dialog: their whole lives, and that’s
dialog: great. You‘’re just not one of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: How would you know?
speaker_heading: JUNE’S MOM
dialog: Because you’re my daughter.
dialog: There’s got to be some of me in
dialog: there somewhere -~ some little
text: adventurous gene, dying to get out.
dialog: Just try something different while
dialog: I’m gone -- anything. Go
text: skydiving. Get drunk at the zoo.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: JUNE'S MOM (cont'd)
dialog: Oooh, I know! Date an exciting
dialog: stranger. Try that website, Mate-
dialog: dot-com.
speaker_heading: JUNE .
dialog: I am not doing the internet dating
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: JUNE’S MOM
dialog: 
dialog: Come on, Junie. It’s not just for
dialog: losers anymore.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Is that their slogan? It’s catchy.
dialog: Look, I'm perfectly capable of
dialog: meeting men on my own.
speaker_heading: JUNE’S MOM
dialog: Sure, you meet them, you date them,
dialog: but it never lasts, does it? And
dialog: why's that?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Because I introduce them to you?
speaker_heading: JUNE’S MOM
dialog: Because they’re everything you say
dialog: you want -- dependable, straight-
dialog: laced, solid career -- but you dump
dialog: them anyway. Because, deep down,
dialog: you know you could never have the
dialog: kind of life you really want. Not
dialog: with them, anyway.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You know what? I’ve got to get
dialog: back to work. Enjoy Burning Man.
dialog: Don’t: get arrested.
speaker_heading: JUNE'S MOM
dialog: No promises.

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - JUNE’S FLOOR - DAY

speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: Today we celebrate Elaine Glazer
dialog: and her thirty years of service to
dialog: this company. Elaine, on behalf of

speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: Read the inscription.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (giddily)
dialog: “Elaine: Congratulations on 30
dialog: years.” This is great. Thank you!
speaker_heading: MR. HEARN
dialog: No, thank you! Here’s to another

text: The crowd applauds and breaks up quickly, leaving June

text: The beaming woman sets the clock down in her cubicle, then
text: goes back to work. Business as usual.
text: June stares, aghast.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNE'S CONDO - EVENING
text: Sparse. Spotless. June sits at the kitchen table, finishes
dialog: dinner.
text: She gets up, rinses her one plate, one glass, one fork and
text: one knife and puts them into the drying rack. She stands
text: there a moment, staring at the lonely place setting, then
text: leaves the kitchen... ROMANTIC MUSIC OVER...

scene_heading: INT. FINE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

text: She looks at the menu, looks up as A MAN comes in the door,
text: looks around. She sits up, hopeful as he walks towards her,
text: but then continues walking and joins a big GROUP in the back.
text: The MAITRE D’ approaches...

speaker_heading: MAITRE D’
dialog: Mademoiselle, are you sure I can’t

text: She glances at a clock that says NINE O'CLOCK.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D’
dialog: But you know-- the weather...
speaker_heading: JUNE

dialog: left an hour early-- he’s probably
text: caught in that.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D’
dialog: Yes. I’m sure of it.
text: June sits there a moment. Feels the looks from the other

speaker_heading: MAITRE D’
dialog: Bastard.
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - SAME
text: It’s RAINING as A FIGURE in an overcoat, collar pulled up,
text: hurriedly crosses the street, glancing over his shoulder.
text: The Figure moves past the restaurant, but backs up, seeing
text: June along at her table, crying. He stands there, his back
text: to us, watching her.

scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - SAME

speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: June, yeah. Andrew?
speaker_heading: MAN/ANDREW
dialog: Guilty. I’m so sorry. How long
dialog: have you been--
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: --Oh, not long. That’s okay.
text: He shakes her hand, smiles at her. She can’t believe her
text: luck. She looks around at the other diners, many looking
text: this way. He takes off his coat and sits.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Just so you know, this is not me.
dialog: I‘m not that guy who keeps a lady
dialog: waiting.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What guy are you?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Right now, a thirsty guy.
text: He opens the wine list, studies it...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You look like a red girl to me. A
text: big bold red...
text: Andrew begins speaking in flawless French. She watches,
text: dazzled as the Maitre D’ laughs at something Andrew says,
text: then bows and moves on to fetch the wine. Andrew turns back
text: to her and smiles.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: So.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Have you done this before?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What? Had dinner with a beautiful
dialog: woman? Once or twice.
dialog:

speaker_heading: JUNE

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Why did you pick me? S
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Look at you.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: But I didn’t post a picture.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No. I know, but... there was so
dialog: much beauty in how you described
dialog: yourself. In your words.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Plus, June was my mother’s name.
text: This gets her smiling again. The Waiter brings the wine.
text: Andrew nods at the wine.label when the waiter shows it to
text: him. The Waiter then starts to open the bottle...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You had some good words yourself.
dialog: It was your poem that got me.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: My poem.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: It was... amazing.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Please don’t make me recite it now.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: That first line is so beautiful.

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Roses are red--
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Okay, I won’t force you.
dialog: , 13.
text: He just smiles as the waiter pours the wine. She watches him
text: taste it like a pro, nod his approval. The waiter pours them
text: each a glass and Andrew raises his.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What should we toast to?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Taking risks.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Good one.
text: They touch glasses and drink, her eyes on him the whole time.
text: The girl believes she has won the lottery. Andrew glances
text: over her shoulder as TWO LARGE MEN IN SUITS AND OVERCOATS
text: move past the window now. He puts his hand in his pocket.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Man, it's really raining out there.
text: June turns to look out the window and Andrew DROPS A SMALL
text: OBJECT INTO HER PURSE. It looks like, well, a small ACTION
text: FIGURE. She then turns back...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Where did you learn to speak
dialog: Prench?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Junior High.
text: She looks at him. He smiles.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I learned on the job.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: As a bankruptcy lawyer?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Boy, you really do read those
dialog: profiles.
dialog: (then)
dialog: My... old job. International
dialog: relations. I speak a dozen
dialog: languages, and a few dialects.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Fluently?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Just enough to order a decent
text: bottle of wine.
dialog: 14.
text: He toasts again, and again they drink. She loves it.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Very decent. So you travel a lot?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Constantly. You?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Not so much. But someday I’m going
dialog: to quit my job and just see the
dialog: world for a couple of years.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Some day? Why wait?
text: Boom. She looks at him.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What’s wrong with right now?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I don’t know. What is wrong with
dialog: right now?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Most people live their entire lives
dialog: waiting for that big thing or that
dialog: big moment to come along and change
dialog: everything. And you know what
dialog: happens?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Nothing. They spend their lives
dialog: waiting. But that’s not me.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (entranced)
dialog: Me neither.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You wanna know something, June?
dialog: (leans closer)
dialog: We're gonna be dead for a lot
dialog: longer than we’re gonna be alive.
dialog: Think about that.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (gone)
dialog: We are, aren't we?
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: So why wait?
text: And with that she leans across the table and kisses him. A
text: long kiss, he looks at her, looks past her to the door where
text: TWO LARGE MEN IN SUITS enter the restaurant, look around. He
text: pulls away first. She looks at him,
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I’m sorry, I don’t know what--
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No. That was great, that was
dialog: unbelievably good. I really
dialog: enjoyed it, but...
dialog: (pushes back)
dialog: Could you excuse me for just a
dialog: minute?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Sure.
text: He gets up, heads for the back of the restaurant as the two

speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Listen, I don’t know what got into

speaker_heading: MILNER

speaker_heading: JUNE .

dialog: They're all trouble...
speaker_heading: NURSE CHERYL
dialog: Honey, if you left the scene of any

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN

speaker_heading: BRACES

speaker_heading: AGENT (ON WALKIE)

scene_heading: INT. JUNE’S CAR - NIGHT
text: June pulls onto the highway. She drives along, takes deep
text: breaths, gets herself together. After a while, she laughs.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: The internet. Jesus. What was I
dialog: thinking?
text: Behind June, we see Milner sit up in the back seat. He holds
dialog: a GUN...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Exactly, June, what were you
dialog: thinking?
text: June SCREAMS, swerving across the road. Milner waves the gun
text: as he talks... .
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You're lucky. I mean, you could've

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: GET OUT OF MY CAR!

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY ~ NIGHT

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What the hell is wrong with you?!

speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Me? What about you? I mean,
dialog: what’s someone looks as good as you
dialog: do, trolling the internet...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: That’s really none of your
dialog: . business.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (waving the gun)
dialog: C’mon, June, I know people. I get
dialog: a--
dialog: (taps his gut with th:
dialog: gun) :
dialog: --feeling and I’m never wrong. And
dialog: I got that feeling with you, like
dialog: something happened. I mean, how's
dialog: it possible you don’t have a man?
text: She doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: . MILNER
dialog: But, hey, we‘ll get to that, right
dialog: now I need your help...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Help? Really? Because it kinda
dialog: looks like--
dialog: (indicates the gun)
dialog: --you wanna kill me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: June, I’m not trying to kill you.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: How do I know that?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Because you’re not dead. Listen, I
dialog: borrowed some stuff from the
dialog: hospital--
text: He reaches into an inside pocket and takes out some bandages,
text: alcohol, needle and thread. June takes out her cell...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I'm calling the cops.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Good luck with that.
text: When June presses TALK on her cell, all she hears is STATIC.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So how’s it work, you look for
dialog: women eating by themselves... then
dialog: what, get them to invest all their
dialog: Money in some pyramid scheme, or do.
dialog: you just kill them, make a bathrobe
dialog: out of their skin?
speaker_heading: MILNER
text: A bathrobe out of their-- June.
dialog: You looked sad. I wasn’t gonna go
dialog: inside, wasn’t planning on it, but
dialog: I saw you sitting there, all alone,
dialog: and... well, I couldn’t help
dialog: myself.
text: She says nothing to that. Doesn’t know if he’s telling the
dialog: truth or not.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I was really enjoying our dinner.
dialog: And I am sorry that I. left, but I
dialog: had bigger issues, like, y’know,
dialog: the fate of the world, to think
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: The fate of the world. Right.
dialog: Okay...
text: She starts backing away.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Oh, man...
text: Milner slumps against a tree, doubling over.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You should be in a hospital. And
dialog: not the regular kind of hospital.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I just need a mirror.
dialog: (looks at her)
dialog: Please.
text: June rifles her purse, hands it to him...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Here.
text: She starts to walk away, but--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Hold this light for me.
text: Milner holds out a pen and June reluctantly takes it. She's
dialog: about to click the top when--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Wait! Don’t touch that.
dialog: (casually)
dialog: Just turn the cap.
text: June does and the pen turns into a strangely high-powered
text: flashlight. It illuminates a bloody wound on Milner’s side.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: My God, you've been shot.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: It happens.
text: June goes gray as Milner sets some supplies next to her purse
text: and starts prepping.
speaker_heading: JUNE
text: It goes all the way through.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Finally, some good news.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I think I’m gonna be sick--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Don't look.
text: As June turns away, she moves: the flashlight completely off
dialog: the wound.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Okay, I’m gonna need you to look.
text: June holds up the mirror and the light so Milner can see. He
text: douses the wound with alcohol but it’s June who winces.
text: Milner doesn’t feel a thing. He pierces the skin, sewing
dialog: himself up.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I don’t think I can do this.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Sure you can, just listen to my
dialog: voice.
text: June takes a deep breath. He goes to work.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: So why were you alone?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: None of your business.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Okay.
dialog: He works some more.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: The poem guy didn’t show, huh?
speaker_heading: JUNE
text: He was late. He got a flat tire.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Really? How'd he do?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You owe him six hundred dollars for
dialog: the wine.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: He get a kiss?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Please stop bringing that up.
text: She looks at Milner as he finishes sewing himself up. He
text: ties off the excess thread with the effortless agility of a
dialog: trained surgeon.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I told you, John Milner.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Okay, what are you?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: That I can’t tell you.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Why? Because then you'd have to
dialog: kill me?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: No. Because other people would
dialog: kill you. And then I'd feel bad.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You might want to look away for
dialog: this next part.
text: She turns away. And Milner uses the opportunity to remove
text: the object, the action figure, from her purse. He slips it
text: into his pocket.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I’ve put you through enough as is.
dialog: Okay, you can look now.
text: She turns as Milner stands and buttons his stained, bloody
text: shirt. He takes out the gun, expertly jacks the clip, and
text: puts it back again. He re-holsters it, looks at her.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Don’t worry, June. You'll never
dialog: see me again.
text: There’s something sad about the way he says that.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Thanks for your help. And I really
dialog: am sorry for walking out like that.
dialog: It was very nice meeting you.
text: Milner turns and walks away. A beat, then June calls after
dialog: him-- .
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Hey!
text: She approaches and hands Milner some clean bandages.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You should take these. And keep
text: the wound damp.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I thought you had to keep it dry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I just read that now they think
dialog: it's better to keep it damp.
speaker_heading: MILNER
text: They keep changing their minds.
dialog: One minute they say fried food and
dialog: cigarettes are bad for you, the
dialog: next...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Fried food and cigarettes are bad
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Huh. Well...
dialog: (takes the bandages)
dialog: Thanks. °
text: Milner walks off. After a few paces, he stops, looks at the
text: bandages in his hand -- damn it. He turns and comes back.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: : Listen, you need to know something.
dialog: a There’s uh, some people gonna come
dialog: looking for me, which unfortunately
dialog: means they’re gonna come looking
dialog: for you, too.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: But I don’t know anything--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: No, but you were seen with me in
dialog: the hospital... which, by the way,
dialog: is why I told you not to take me
dialog: there. But--
dialog: (holds up a hand)
dialog: Water under the bridge. Important
dialog: thing for you to know now is that
dialog: these boys are professionals. If
dialog: they want to find you, they will.
dialog: They’1l identify themselves as FBI
dialog: and tell you some bullshit story
dialog: about me. It’1ll all sound very
dialog: convincing, but it’s extremely
dialog: important that you do not go with
dialog: them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Okay, Milner, or whatever you wanna
dialog: call yourself, why should I believe
dialog: anything you say?
text: Milner pulls out a badge, barely shows it to her before he
text: puts it back.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Because I'm in the FBI.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You just told me what you did.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: They’re gonna kill you anyway.
text: She stands there, doesn’t know what to say.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Now, if you do happen to go with
dialog: them, and they don’t take you
dialog: straight to a police station or the
dialog: local bureau office... If they take
dialog: you anywhere else -- even if they
dialog: tell you you’re safe -- it means
dialog: they're going to kill you.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: If they tell me I’m safe--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: They're gonna kill you. Now here's
dialog: the important part: there’1ll
text: probably be a oner in the back.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: A what-er?
speaker_heading: MILNER
text: A piece, a glock, a gat. Probably
dialog: ad.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: A gun?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Half the time they forget it’s
dialog: there. If it’s a Caprice, it’ll be
dialog: under the seat, between your legs.
dialog: If it’s a Crown Vic, it’s ina
dialog: panel in the seat in front of you.
dialog: Got it?
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Don’t got it. Don’t want it. I
dialog: hate guns.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You’1l hate them less when you
dialog: really need one. Trust me.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Trust you.
text: Milner starts backing away.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Hey, June? That kiss was really
dialog: something.
text: Milner then turns and heads off into the night and
dialog: disappears.

dialog: 31.
text: Confused, she sits up to see ACKERMAN holding the alarm clock
text: out of her reach.
text: A ROOM FULL OF AGENTS IN SWAT GEAR stand around her bed, all

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Good morning, Ms. Holyfield.

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Milner.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

scene_heading: INSERT - PHOTO OF A DEAD WOMAN
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: She disappeared on a diving trip...

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
text: This one died in a parachuting

dialog: a parachute. And this one somehow
text: fell off a moving train.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I don’t understand...
text: She looks at the photos, horrified, confused.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: The man you helped tonight has been
text: posing as a federal agent in order
dialog: to lure innocent civilians -- women
dialog: -- into helping him pull off
dialog: various national security breaches.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What sort of “breaches?”
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: I can't go into it other than to
dialog: say he usually targets women who
dialog: are, shall we say, vulnerable.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: He gets a lot of women over the
dialog: internet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Well, I don’t do that.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Miss Holyfield. We need you to
dialog: tell us where he is.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I have no idea. I just met the guy
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Then why did you take him to the
dialog: hospital?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: The man fell on my car. What was I
dialog: supposed to do, leave him there?
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: No, you were supposed to call the
dialog: police.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I tried. Look, I have no idea who
dialog: he is or where he is. But I’m
dialog: pretty sure that you’re not allowed
dialog: to just barge into someone’s house
dialog: and--
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Wake up, Miss Holyfield, this is
dialog: America. I’m allowed to do
dialog: whatever is necessary to protect
dialog: its citizens. Now, did he say
dialog: anything that could be helpful? '
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We're gonna be dead for longer than
dialog: we're gonna be alive.
text: The agents look at each other.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: He also said that he was an
text: undercover agent on a highly
dialog: sensitive mission.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: And you believed that bullshit?
speaker_heading: JUNE :
dialog: No, of course not. "
text: She sits there feeling like an idiot now.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Miss Holyfield, you were targeted.
dialog: That means he’s not going to leave
dialog: you alone. Which means you now
dialog: need protection.
text: June hugs herself. Jesus. The news keeps getting worse.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: I think the best thing for us to do
dialog: right now would be to hand you over
dialog: to the local police, let them keep
dialog: an eye on you.

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You said that already.
text: He turns around smiles at her.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Because I mean it.
text: June starts breathing heavily. Shit. What to do? Just
text: then, something catches her eye. A placard on the dashboard
dialog: reads, “CAPRICE.”
text: June thinks for a moment, trying to remember what Milner
text: said. Then she reaches, slowly, quietly, below the seat
text: between her legs. Her hands land on what she’s looking for.
text: June suddenly pulls out the gun. She holds it like it’s on
text: fire, like it’s about to go off in her hands--

speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: C'mon, June. Knock it off.
dialog: (holds up the gun)
dialog: Rule number one: you don’t ever

dialog: retreat.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: As a BUS starts to pull away from the curb--
speaker_heading: JUNE (0.S8.)
dialog: Wait!
text: --stops suddenly as June crosses the street directly in front
text: of it, bangs on the door.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Let me in!
scene_heading: INT. BUS - SAME
text: As June gets on, looks behind her to make sure no one saw
text: her. She walks down the aisle to the back ignoring the
text: stares of the other passengers, who take in this crazy-eyed
text: woman scratched up, covered in dirt, missing a shoe...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Milner hurries back to the SUV.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Okay, change of plan...
text: He stops, realizing he is talking to no one.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET ABOVE JUNE’S CONDO - LATER
text: NOW SWARMING WITH COPS. June’s NEIGHBORS watch from their
text: condos. June steps into FRAME, out of breath, exhausted.
text: She heads for the nearest cop, his back to her.
text: We HEAR THE RADIO IN A SQUAD CAR as she passes...
speaker_heading: DISPATCH (RADIO)
dialog: All units be advised, female
dialog: suspect, June Louise Holyfield--
text: June freezes. Looks at the car.
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: DISPATCH (RADIO)
dialog: --wanted in connection with the
text: shooting on Highway 2. Suspect is
dialog: five foot five, twenty-eight years
dialog: old...
text: June quietly backs away, hurries along to the next block.
text: And now Milner’s SUV quietly pulls up alongside her.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I told you not to leave the car.
text: She keeps walking.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Now you’ve fled the scene. Your
dialog: prints are all over your gun...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: That’s not my gun!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Hey, if you’d trusted me and hung
dialog: out just another minute or two, I
dialog: could have helped you clean it up.
dialog: Now c’mon, get in the car...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I'm not getting in any more cars
dialog: with anybody.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: June--
text: She stops, turns and looks at him.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Look, I know about the other women.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: What “other women?”
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: The dead ones. I saw the pictures!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Right. My “victims.” Yeah, that’s
text: one of Ackerman’s favorites.
dialog: C'mon, June, do I look like a
dialog: serial killer?
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Serial killers never look like
dialog: serial killers.
text: She starts walking again.
speaker_heading: MILNER ~
dialog: Well, you should know that violence
dialog: to me is always a last resort.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Nice meeting you, John. Or
dialog: whatever your real name is.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: And the only people I've actually
dialog: killed--
text: She stops again. That doesn’t make her feel better.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Okay, let me put it another way,
dialog: I’ve never killed any women or
dialog: children. Not that that hasn’t
dialog: complicated things in the past, but
dialog: that’s a rule I live by.
text: She just looks at him, frustrated.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Serial killer. Man, I can’t
dialog: believe you fell for that old
dialog: chestnut--
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Just... what do you want?!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Vamos a la playa!
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You want to go to the beach?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I want a fish taco.
text: June resumes walking. He’s insane.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Really, June, I’m starved. We
dialog: never even ordered dinner...
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (indicates the cops down
dialog: the hill)
dialog: They're all looking for us and you
dialog: want to go get Mexican food?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Standard Procedure in this type of
dialog: situation is to do a Stop-and-Drop.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: A Stop-and-Drop.
speaker_heading: MILNER
text: Throw off the Pursuit Vectoring
dialog: Protocols by remaining motionless
dialog: within the Primary Containment
dialog: Sphere for at least twenty-seven
dialog: minutes. That'll keep us off the
dialog: radar long enough to get on the
text: other side of the I.P.W.
dialog: (off June’s look)
dialog: Initial Pursuit Window?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Why is it the more you talk, the
dialog: less I understand you?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: It's simple: they think we’re going
dialog: out, so we’re going in.
dialog: (then)
dialog: c'mon, get in the car, June.
text: She thinks a moment, looks back at her condo, finally walks
text: around the SUV, gets in...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Vamos a la Playa...
scene_heading: EXT. “VAMOS A LA PLAYA” TACO JOINT - DAY
text: A cheesy taco joint off the highway. Milner’s SUV sits in
text: the parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. TACO JOINT - DAY
text: Milner leads June into the restaurant. He spots a SECURITY
text: CAMERA on the wall and leads them to a booth that’s out of
text: the camera's view.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: This one’s my favorite booth.
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: INT. TACO JOINT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Milner digs into his food. June has no appetite. She just
text: glares at him with her arms crossed.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (eating)
dialog: What'd I tell you? Good, right?
text: She doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Feeling better?
text: She still doesn’t answer. Milner stops eating and sits back.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Okay. You have a right to know.
text: Milner reaches into his coat, pulls out his handkerchief,
text: unwraps it to reveal the plastic action figure he dropped
text: into her purse earlier.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: This is what it’s all about.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: It’s all about a Burger King toy?
text: He breaks off the head on the edge of the table, and we see a
text: METALLIC OBJECT inside the action figure. He picks it up...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: The fate of the world is in the
dialog: hands of this little baby--
text: (accidently drops it into
dialog: the salsa)
dialog: --shit--
text: She watches as he pulls it out, wipes it off with his napkin.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: That's the second time that’s
dialog: happened--
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: It’s a battery.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: A battery.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Only not your average Duracell or
dialog: Eveready. See, someone finally
dialog: figured out how to convert the
dialog: water molecule into its component
dialog: elements -- hydrogen and oxygen.
dialog: So this battery never runs out.
dialog: Never ever. Ever. Ever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: That’s it? That’s what this is all
dialog: about? A battery.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: That's it? Man, you’re not very
dialog: politically savvy are you, June?
dialog: It’s an infinite source of
dialog: energy... the kind of thing that
dialog: could render fossil fuels obsolete.
dialog: And let’s see, what’s the economy
dialog: based on...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I understand the implications--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: The joke is, they’ve had it for a
dialog: long time now. Maybe ten years.
text: June stares at the battery as he folds it up in the
text: handkerchief again, puts it back in his pocket.
speaker_heading: MILNER
text: Too much money still on the table
dialog: with oil, so they’ve been hiding it
dialog: until the right time.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Ackerman says you stole it.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: He’s right.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So... you did steal it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: From Ackerman.
dialog: (leans in close)
dialog: He’s framing me.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: But you just admitted you stole it.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So how could he be framing you?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Because, originally, Ackerman and I
dialog: were sent to protect it, but then
dialog: one day I find out he’s made a deal
dialog: to sell it to the highest bidder,
dialog: so I took the battery and ran.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: To protect it.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: But for Ackerman to save himself,
dialog: he’s gotta make me the bad guy. I
dialog: still can’t believe he did it. I
dialog: mean, he was my partner. That’s
dialog: supposed to count for something.
text: Milner looks away, suddenly becoming emotional. He actually
text: starts to get teary, quickly becoming wracked with sobs.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Yeah, it’s just... I get a little
dialog: emotional talking about it. I
dialog: mean, we'd been through a lot
dialog: together. After that mission in
dialog: Afghanistan, I thought we really
dialog: bonded. Hell, I taught him to sand
dialog: breathe...
text: Milner chokes up again.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Uh...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (collecting himself)
dialog: Anyway, that’s why everyone's
dialog: trying to kill me.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Us. Everyone's trying to kill us.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Yeah, well, you were seen with me,
dialog: so they think you know something.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: JUNE /
dialog: But I didn’t know anything.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Not then, but you do now.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Because you just told me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Well, you asked.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: No, I didn’t. You said, “Okay,
dialog: here’s what it’s all about.”
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Because you wanted know.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Look, why don’t you just give it
dialog: back to the government, tell the
dialog: truth about all of it?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Give it back. That’s adorabley
dialog: June. Tell me, who? Who do I give
dialog: it back to? I don’t know who to
dialog: trust. Ackerman clearly had
text: someone on the inside.
text: June shakes her head, looks around the joint.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Right now, I just wanna keep it
dialog: safe while I figure it all out.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: And I wanna go home.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Really? Because... I can’t stop
dialog: thinking about that kiss.
text: (she turns back to him)
dialog: I just wonder, if maybe I wasn’t so s
dialog: busy saving the world, maybe you
dialog: and I couldn’t spend some time
dialog: getting to know each other.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I'm... flattered. Which is kind of
dialog: pathetic, actually.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: JUNE (cont'd)
dialog: But, right now, I just really need
dialog: to go home. Can you understand
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: MILNER
text: Completely.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Thank you.
text: In one swift motion, Milner PULLS OUT A HUGE GUN, throws June
text: into a STRANGLEHOLD, and drags her out of the booth, to out
text: in plain view of the security camera.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Hey-- what’re you doing?!
speaker_heading: MILNER
text: ALRIGHT EVERYBODY DOWN OR I BLOW
text: THIS BITCH’S HEAD OFF!!
text: SCREAMS. Panic. Milner FIRES THREE SHOTS into the air! A
text: light SHATTERS on the floor. Everybody hits the deck. He
text: puts his gun right into June’s cheek.
speaker_heading: JUNE .
dialog: Please don’t shoot me!
text: Milner's wild-eyed, crazy.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Don’t make me.
text: Milner fans the gun at the room.
speaker_heading: : MILNER
dialog: Heads down, I mean it! I see a
dialog: face, I’m gonna blow it away!
text: Milner drags a petrified June towards the door.
scene_heading: EXT. TACO JOINT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Milner backs out of the door, still holding the gun on June.
speaker_heading: MILNER
text: 97...96...KEEP COUNTING! YOU LOOK
dialog: AT ME, YOU DIE! 95...94...
text: Milner locks the front door of the restaurant then throws the
text: keys into the weeds.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What the hell's going on?!
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
text: Milner shoves June towards his car, deadly serious--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Get in.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: No way!
text: Milner points the gun at her--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You can ride in the front or you
dialog: can ride in the trunk. It’s your
dialog: choice.
text: June slides in, latches her seatbelt, and quickly shuts the
dialog: door.
text: With that, Milner jumps behind the wheel, and hauls ass out
dialog: of there. — .
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Milner drives as June stares forward, panicked. Suddenly,
text: Milner starts laughing--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Man, I wish you could’ve seen the
dialog: look on your face. “Please don’t
dialog: shoot me.” Your eyes all buggy--
dialog: (then)
dialog: Put you in the trunk... Like I'd
dialog: do that. I mean, really, June. I
dialog: told you I’ve never killed a woman
dialog: before!
text: June goes for the door handle. He snaps, serious--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: June pulls back her hand.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I had to go crazy back there. It
dialog: was the only way to get you out of
dialog: trouble. There were security
dialog: cameras all over. ‘Now there’s hard
dialog: proof that you're my hostage.
text: June sits a moment in silence. Not sure if she believes him.
dialog: A beat then--
dialog: 
dialog: ospperne.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Why didn’t you tell me?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: It had to look real. And it did...
text: He starts laughing again. She SMACKS him hard across the
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Ouch. Good one.
text: He notices something ahead, goes serious.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Ah, here we go: roadblock. Thank
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You‘re glad?
text: Way up ahead in the distance a ROADBLOCK comes into view,
text: cherries blazing.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Well, now that you’re in the clear,
dialog: you'll be safe with them.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Like really safe? Or “they're
dialog: gonna kill me” safe?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Really safe.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What about Ackerman?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: He's after me. He just wants the
dialog: battery.
text: He pulls over, reaches across and opens her door.
speaker_heading: JUNE .
dialog: You're really letting me go?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Was nice meeting you, Jtine. And
dialog: I'm really sorry for any trouble I
dialog: put you through.
text: She starts to get out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Have a nice life, June.
text: He looks forward, starts to put the car in gear, but sees
text: something in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: . MILNER
dialog: Uh-oh.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What?
text: Just then, a BLACK OPS HELICOPTER appears out of nowhere.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Stay in the car.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Who are they?
text: The helicopter whips up a tornado of dust.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Shut the door.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What-- aren’t they the cops?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: No-—
text: Milner points to the roadblock--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Those are the cops.
dialog: (pointing to helicopter)
dialog: These are the bad guys.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: The FBI guys?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: No. Some other bad guys.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What other bad guys?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Actually, worse guys.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Worse guys?!
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Okay, listen to me very carefully
dialog: and do exactly what I say. Here--
text: He pulls a MACHINE PISTOL out from under the seat.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I need you to take this gun and
text: start shooting at the helicopter.
dialog: Just keep shooting until it falls
text: out of the sky or explodes. Either
dialog: one is good. And put on this
dialog: vest...
text: He hands her a Kevlar vest which she just stares at.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: C’mon, hurry. And, June, this is
dialog: important: whatever you do, don’t
text: get out of the car.
text: She puts on the vest. Milner throws the car into a 180.
text: The second the car skids to a stop...
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME
text: June dives out of the car, scrambles to her feet and starts
text: to run like crazy. She waves her arms at the helicopter.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Help! I’m not with him! I don’t
dialog: even know him! I'm innocent!
text: They start shooting at her from the helicopter, riddling the
text: ground all around her. June runs back to Milner’s car...
scene_heading: INT. MILNER’S CAR - SAME
text: -As June dives in...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I‘m with you! I’m with you!
text: Bullets strafe the roof, but don’t make a dent. This gets
text: her attention.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: What did I tell you?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Don’t get out of the car.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: And what did you do?
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I‘m sorry! I panicked!
text: Milner throws the car into drive and takes off, heading
text: straight for the roadblock. She holds up the gun...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I can’t shoot at anybody!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Sure you can, you just need a
dialog: little help...
text: Milner leans over and opens the glove box, pulls out a FLASK.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Take a shot of this.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Tequila.
text: She knocks back a mouthful from the flask and winces.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I need a lime...
text: June tries to focus as the dashboard opens up and Milner
text: starts going through an array of high tech weapons.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I feel fuzzy-- I mean, funny.
text: She looks at Milner who locks and loads...
speaker_heading: JUNE .
dialog: Okay, that wasn’t tequila, was it?
text: She begins to fade in and out of consciousness...
scene_heading: EXT. VARIOUS - JUNE’S POV - NIGHT
text: -A MASK is put over June’s pov.
text: -A HELICOPTER catapults towards us out of a giant FIREBALL.
text: -MEN WITH GUNS shoot at us, rappelling past the windshield.
text: -Milner yells through his mask, wielding a strange weapon.
text: -A POLICE CAR corkscrews through the air, barely missing us.
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: FADE IN ON JUNE
text: As she wakes up. She’s on a cement floor...
text: PULL BACK TO REVAL: A WAREHOUSE
text: Milner, knife in hand, is fighting several people at once.
text: He glances at her...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Just a sec, June--
text: He then takes them all out, moves towards her just as she
text: ‘passes out again and we...
scene_heading: CcuT TO BLACK
text: SOUND OF A HELICOPTER OVER...
text: FADE IN ON THE INSIDE OF A HELICOPTER
text: It’s crashing. Milner is putting a parachute on June...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: We have to hurry!
text: He helps her up...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Jump!
text: And as he PULLS HER out the door, we hear JUNE SCREAM and...
dialog: cut TO BLACK
text: SOUND OF A POWERBOAT...
scene_heading: FADE IN: A CIGARETTE BOAT
text: As June wakes up on the boat, Milner at the helm, as they
text: streak across the open ocean. Milner looks back at her,
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: MILNER
text: Almost there.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: We hear SEAGULLS. WAVES.
scene_heading: FADE IN: MILNER’S HIDE-OUT - TROPICAL ISLAND - DAY
text: June blinks, her eyes adjusting as she sits up on her elbows.
dialog: (53.
scene_heading: HER POV - THE OCEAN
text: Sunflares kick off the water as an out-of-focus silhouette
text: emerges from the sea: it’s Milner in SLO-MO, carrying some
text: diving equipment and two huge lobsters, much like the Mate-
text: dot-com ad.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Uh, I missed something.
text: She sits up in a hammock beside a hut, wearing a bikini top
text: and a sarong. Milner holds up the two lobsters--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Hey, sleepyhead. I hope you like
dialog: lobster.
text: June scrambles out of the hammock, stumbles.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You drugged me...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Was for your own good, June. You
dialog: weren’t really coping all that well
dialog: and I needed to get us out of
dialog: there.
text: Milner calmly drops his fins and mask in the sand.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Where are we? What are we doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: MILNER
text: Hiding out, reloading, relaxing.
text: June realizes what she’s wearing.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Uh, okay, Milner--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: C’mon, June. I’ve been trained to
text: dismantle a bomb in the pitch black
text: with nothing but a safety pin and a
dialog: Junior Mint, I think I can get you
text: in and out of some clothes without
text: looking.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m not saying I did that. I’m
dialog: just saying I could.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
text: He smiles at her and she hits him the face. I mean, really
text: nails him one, so that he stumbles, drops to one knee. She
text: then hurries off down the beach. He touches his jaw, smiles.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Wow.
text: He watches her run off, impressed.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
text: June storms through the jungle, furious. She ignores the
text: vines and branches that scratch at her and pushes through
text: them to another beach.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Shit.
text: She stands there, looking out a more treacherous stretch of
text: coastline. She takes a breath and starts walking.
scene_heading: EXT. HUT - DAY
text: With the flair of a professional chef, Milner whistles
text: happily as he bastes some fish grilling over coals, then adds
text: some seasoning. He grates some cheese over some simmering
text: seafood jambalaya.
scene_heading: EXT. COASTLINE - DAY
text: As June makes her way through the marshy terrain. She slips,
text: falls into a puddle of mud up to her waist.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Dammit!
text: Suddenly, a heavy TROPICAL DELUGE slams down on her head.
text: June climbs out of the mud-hole, forcing herself forward.
scene_heading: EXT. HUT - DAY
text: Milner expertly squeezes out an icing glaze from an icing bag
text: atop a few fudge truffles, making delicate swirls.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE COASTLINE - DUSK
text: June drags herself along -- soaking wet, exhausted, starving.
text: She starts to really panic. It’s getting darker by the
text: minute. She can barely see where she’s going.
text: Like a miracle, she sees something in the distance. She
text: squints into the gloom. Are those torches? She can just
text: make out some kind of structure, built into the hillside.
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
text: Summoning her last gasp of energy, June quickens her pace,
text: crawling towards the structure, scrambling up the beach...
text: She suddenly stops dead as she realizes -- this is the place
text: she left hours ago. Milner stands there, seasoning a
text: simmering pot over a fire.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Big island, huh?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: If you're going to kill me, just
dialog: kill me.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I don’t want to kill you. I just
dialog: want to finish our date.
scene_heading: INT. HUT - NIGHT
text: June comes out of the bedroom, showered, wearing the sarong
text: like a dress... just as Milner takes a machete and chops a
text: coconut in half, hands June a cocktail in it.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Here. Very refreshing.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Will it knock me out?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Only if you drink like nine of ‘em.
text: She doesn’t move. He takes a drink. Then passes it to her.
text: She takes it, looks around.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So... is this your... hideout?
speaker_heading: MILNER
text: One of them.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: How many places have: you got?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Twelve. No-- eleven, the place in
dialog: Burma blew up last month.
text: June watches as Milner puts the finishing touches on the
text: exotic meal he’s prepared.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Everything you say seems like such
dialog: bullshit... I have no clue who you
dialog: really are.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Part of me being able to do my job
dialog: is people not knowing who I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So am I, like, your hostage?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Not at all. You can leave any time
dialog: you want. But...
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: But what?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Why are you in such a hurry to get
dialog: home?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I have a life. People who depend
dialog: on me.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: The world depends on me. And yet
dialog: here I am, relaxing.
dialog: (back to work)
dialog: Besides, they'll kill you if you go
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You have the battery. Why would
dialog: they want to kill me?
text: He sets a plate of beautiful food down in front of her.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I was on the run that night, when I
dialog: saw you sitting there crying, and I
dialog: have to say, you really moved me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You told me this--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I dropped the battery in your
dialog: purse.
dialog: 57.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: They tracked it.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So they think I’m involved.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Well, you kinda are involved.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: But I’m ‘gonna get you out of it.
dialog: (then)
dialog: C'mon, eat...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You’re an FBI agent. Can’t you
dialog: just talk to somebody--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I never said I was an FBI agent.
dialog: I said I was in the FBI.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What's the difference?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I had to infiltrate the FBI as part
dialog: of my mission. The truth is, I
dialog: work for a much more powerful
dialog: global organization.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: MILNER
speaker_heading: The IIA -- International
dialog: Intelligence Agency.
speaker_heading: JUNE |
dialog: Never heard of them.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I hope not. If you had, then
dialog: somebody's not doing their job.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You're telling me you're some kind
dialog: of super-spy?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Well... super’s kind of braggy, but
dialog: yeah.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: MILNER (cont'd)
dialog: Actually, I’m more like a trouble
dialog: shooter. They point me at trouble
dialog: and I--
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Shoot it?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I was gonna say fix it, but once in
dialog: a while, yeah, that’s what I have
dialog: to do. Come on, your food's
dialog: getting cold.
dialog: 
text: She finally takes a bite.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You know I find all this a little a
dialog: little hard to-- oh my God this is
dialog: good!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: No, really, really good. Like “the
dialog: best thing I’ve ever tasted” good.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Please, you embarrass me.
text: She eagerly devours her meal as Milner looks on.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So what’s your plan?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: No plan.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What kind of secret agent doesn’t
dialog: have a plan?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: The smart kind. A plan is just a
dialog: road map so the bad guys can find
dialog: me. * But if I don’t know what’s
text: next, then they don’t either.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: That’s ridiculous. You don’t know
dialog: what you’re doing, so no one else
dialog: will know what you’re doing?
dialog: That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever
dialog: heard.
dialog: 59.
text: Suddenly, an ALARM GOES OFF AND ALL OF THE LIGHTS GO OUT.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What’s going on?
text: Milner looks off, sees LIGHTS in the distance.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Huh. How about that? The bad guys
dialog: found us anyway. Maybe you’re
dialog: right about the no-plan thing after
dialog: all.
dialog: 
text: Milner starts grabbing weapons.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Think you’re ready to fire a gun?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I hate guns.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: That’s what I thought you’d say.
text: He puts his hand on the back of her neck and squeezes. She
text: passes out at his feet.
text: He looks at her lying there on the floor of the hut. He
text: reaches out to touch her hair, but stops himself.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Jesus, get a hold of yourself,
dialog: John.
text: He takes a breath, turns towards the lights.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: CLOSE ON JUNE
text: Asleep. She wakes up. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're...
scene_heading: INT. DARKENED ROOM - DAY
text: June, confused, looks up to see MILNER.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Great, you’re awake. C'mon.
text: He helps her up.
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Milner leads June out the door of a building and leads her
text: down the city street.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (trying to remember)
dialog: You drugged me again.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Actually, I didn’t drug you. I
dialog: used a pressure point.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: That still counts, I can’t believe
dialog: you did that again. Didn’t I
dialog: explicitly tell you not to--
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: What happened to the island?
text: Before them, a flock of pigeons alights to reveal: THE
text: PANTHEON across from them. June stares up at it. . She’s
dialog: never seen anything like it.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Welcome to Rome.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Oh, my God.
text: She’s in awe. Milner puts his arm around her.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Beautiful, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I've always wanted to--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: First time, huh? Always the best.
text: Milner leads her away. She looks around at the various
text: sites. Can't believe her eyes. Can’t believe she’s here.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: There’s someone here I can give the
dialog: battery to.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Name’s Salvatore Russo. Bigtime
dialog: environmentalist, philanthropist.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: —
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: MILNER (cont'd)
dialog: Brilliant. Squeaky clean.
dialog: Powerful friends. There’s no way
dialog: he'd let the battery get into the
dialog: wrong hands.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Never met him before... but he’s
dialog: going to be at an environmental
dialog: .summit reception tonight. I
dialog: thought we’d crash. Then I’m gonna
dialog: take you to the embassy, get your
dialog: name cleared. Send you home.
text: She stops cold, looks over his shoulder. Ackerman’s number
text: two, the big read head, loiters across the street, pretends
text: to look in a shop window. His ARM IS IN.A SLING.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: What--
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Don’t turn around.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: One of Ackerman’s guys... the big
text: Howdy Doody lookalike with braces.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I shot him. Didn’t I?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Well, he’s here.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Just keep walking.
text: Milner ducks into an alley. Presses June up against a wall.
text: They wait, up close like this, and a moment later the agent
text: walks by, but doesn’t look down the alley...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You're right. That’s him.
dialog: (looks at June)
dialog: Nice get, June.
text: They stay close for a moment. Look at each other.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: We should probably wait here a few
dialog: extra minutes, just to be safe.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Yeah. Just to be safe.
text: A nice moment. The nice moment is broken, however, when a
text: GUN is put into Milner’s ear.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Ow.
scene_heading: WIDEN TO REVEAL: THE RED HEADED AGENT
text: Holding his gun to Milner’s head.
speaker_heading: BRACES
dialog: Small world. Ciao, Milner.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: That means “good-bye,” shithead.
speaker_heading: BRACES
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Actually, it’s like aloha, you can
dialog: say it either coming or going...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (smiles at June)
dialog: You're full of surprises.
speaker_heading: BRACES
dialog: Whatever. You move and it’s aloha
dialog: to your fuckin brains.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (looks into June’s eyes)
dialog: I’m happy right where I am.
text: She smiles at him. And suddenly, Braces cries out as she
text: kicks the man hard in the shin. Milner, still looking at
text: June, elbows him in the face and now June kicks him again,
text: this time in that higher spot that bends a man over.
text: Milner takes June by the hand and they take off running.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I think aloha can also mean “I love
dialog: you.”
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: INT. VERSACE - DAY
text: As Milner and June duck inside. Milner looks out the window,
text: satisfied they're not being followed he turns to June...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Very nice. I’m impressed.
text: But June’s gone. He sees that she’s wandered off, taking in
dialog: the beautiful clothing...
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Gianni?
text: June looks over as a pretty young SALESGIRL comes over and
text: embraces Milner.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: “Gianni?”
text: They begin conversing in Italian. Milner is fluent and keeps
text: up with her. She laughs at a joke he tells, notices a now
text: self-conscious June standing there.
speaker_heading: MILNER (SUBTITLED)
dialog: Oh... yeah, I need you to make her
text: even prettier than she is.
speaker_heading: SALESGIRL (SUBTITLED)
dialog: Do, I have to?
speaker_heading: MILNER (SUBTITLED)
dialog: Yes... and make sure she gets to
dialog: this address by eight o'clock.
text: June, blown away by Milner’s linguistic skill, watches as he
text: scribbles on a card, then hands the girl a BLACK AMEX.
speaker_heading: SALESGIRL (SUBTITLED)
dialog: (eyeing June)
dialog: I'm very jealous, Gianni.
speaker_heading: MILNER (SUBTITLED)
dialog: Don't worry--
text: (kisses the girl on the
dialog: cheek)
dialog: It's just business.
text: The Salesgirl nods, “Ah.” June looks hurt -- she’s learned
dialog: enough Italian to translate Milner’s words: “It’s just
dialog: business.”
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (to the Salesgirl)
dialog: Grazie.
text: The Salesgirl follows Milner over to June.
speaker_heading: / MILNER
dialog: Elisa will take good care of you
dialog: while I go run some errands, get
dialog: ready for tonight.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Pick out whatever you want. I'll
dialog: see you in a few hours.
text: Milner exits. June looks around the store, overwhelmed. The
text: Salesgirl nods for her to follow... :
scene_heading: EXT. ROME STREET - DAY
text: A noisy residential neighborhood. Milner gets out of a taxi,
text: looks up at an apartment building.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME
text: Milner climbs the steps, pulls out his gun...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SAME
text: As Milner comes to a door, knocks.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: It’s me.
text: The door opens to the limit of the chain and we see THE RED
text: HEAD WITH BRACES peering through the crack. Finally--
speaker_heading: BRACES
dialog: You're an asshole.
text: He shuts the door, takes off the chain and re-opens it.
speaker_heading: BRACES
dialog: First you shoot me, then you kick
dialog: me in the nuts. What’s up with
dialog: that?
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: It was June who kicked you. And
dialog: she saw you. She’s not stupid...
dialog: Little uptight maybe, but not
dialog: stupid.
dialog: (looks into the apartment)
dialog: You alone in there?
speaker_heading: BRACES
dialog: It’s all clear.
text: Milner puts his gun away, follows Braces inside.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Everything set?
speaker_heading: BRACES
dialog: Good to go.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Where’s Ackerman?
speaker_heading: BRACES
dialog: At the embassy. What’s up with the
dialog: girl, really?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: She’s just a civilian.
speaker_heading: BRACES
text: She doesn’t kick like one.
text: Milner smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. MUSEUM - EVENING
text: Milner stands at the top of the steps, wearing a perfectly
text: cut tux. He watches as a limo pulls up. The DRIVER gets
text: out, holds the door open for June, a knockout in her new
text: evening gown. Milner walks down the steps to meet her. All
dialog: business...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Alright, let’s go.
text: He takes her arm, but she stays put. He looks back at her.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: This is the part where you tell me
dialog: how beautiful I look.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Do you really need to hear it?
dialog: 66.
text: He gestures to the crowd and sure enough, everyone is looking
text: at her. He starts leading her up. After a moment...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Let’s go to work.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND ROOM - MUSEUM - EVENING
text: They enter and Milner immediately grabs an hors d’oeuvre off
text: a passing tray.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Grazie.
dialog: (eats)
dialog: I’m starving.
text: They look around, take in the scene which is basically a lot
text: of OVERWEIGHT MEN in tuxedoes with BEAUTIFUL WOMEN who may or
text: may not be their wives. on their arms. Imagine a room full of
text: Karl Roves standing amongst beautiful art and you’re there.
speaker_heading: JUNE.
dialog: How are we gonna find Russo in this
dialog: crowd?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (looking at her)
dialog: He'll find us.
text: A TANGO starts and Milner leads her towards the dance floor--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Come on, let’s dance.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Milner, I don’t dance. Well, I
dialog: dance, but--
dialog: (gesturing to the dance
dialog: floor)
dialog: —-just not like that.
text: She watches them all tango.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You can’t be a spy if you don’t
dialog: know ‘how to tango.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I don’t tango.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: All right. We’ll just have to mix
text: it up a little.
dialog: 67.
text: June watches as Milner pulls the BAND LEADER aside and slips
text: him some money. The tango comes to an abrupt end. The
text: confused dancers stop.
text: Milner moves June to middle of the dance floor.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Just try your best to keep up.
text: The band launches into lively SALSA MUSIC.
text: Milner expertly starts salsa dancing. June grins -- she
text: expertly keeps pace with him, dancing with surprisingly
text: sultry rhythm.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (wowed )
dialog: Okay, this was way better than a
dialog: tango.
text: The crowd looks on, impressed. Others start dancing as well.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So how’s Russo going to find us?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: He already has.
dialog: (looks off)
text: The white-haired guy with the thick
dialog: glasses. He’s looking at you,
dialog: isn’t he?
text: Milner grabs June and dips her low to the ground. She looks
text: at Russo, upside down, giving him a great shot of her
text: cleavage.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Milner pulls her back up.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: All those Nobel prizes and he still
dialog: needs to be with the prettiest girl
text: in the room.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You’re welcome.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You don’t look half bad yourself.
dialog: 
dialog: neaeese.
dialog: 68.
text: He grabs her, dips her again, looking at her.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: That's the first nice thing you've
dialog: said since we met.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Must be the Stockholm Syndrome
text: talking.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Not bad for a first date, eh?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Is that what this still is?
text: They look at each other, as the moment gets awkward...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So... how you want to approach him?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I’m not. You are.
text: Milner spins June around and pulls her back in.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Hit me.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You did it before.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I was mad at you before. I’m not
dialog: mad at you now.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Okay. I don’t know what to go with
dialog: -- the fact that you actually had z
dialog: to use the internet to get a date 3
dialog: or that you look like you've
dialog: somehow gained eight pounds since I
dialog: met you. :
text: BAM! June slaps Milner really hard.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Now act upset.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I am upset!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Good, now I need you to go to the
dialog: little girls room, and when Russo
dialog: finds you, tell him you wanna meet
text: him on the terrace in five minutes.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Screw you!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Look, you don’t have to kiss him or
dialog: anything, just--
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I’m acting upset.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Oh. Nice.
text: She then grabs a drink from a passing tray and throws it in
text: Milner’s face.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Okay, June--
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (slaps him again)
dialog: I’m in the moment.
text: June walks off “in a huff” as Milner looks around at the
text: other DANCERS, who are staring. He makes the international
dialog: sign for “crazy.”
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Pazza. Loca.
dialog: They don’t get it.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Americana.
text: Everyone nods, understanding, as we CUT TO...
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: As June approaches the ladies room, Russo appears. He's
text: tall, the lights reflected in his thick glasses.
speaker_heading: RUSSO
dialog: May I be of some assistance?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (not making it easy,
dialog: reaches for the door)
dialog: I think I can manage.
speaker_heading: RUSSO
dialog: So I saw.
text: She pauses, looks back at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSO
dialog: Do you know who I am?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Bathroom attendant?
speaker_heading: RUSSO
dialog: (extends his hand)
dialog: Salvatore Russo. And I'd be very
dialog: disappointed if I wasn’t given a
dialog: chance to get to know you better.
speaker_heading: . JUNE
dialog: It's your party. Try if you want
dialog: to.
text: She realizes.just how lame that sounded, tries not to wince.
speaker_heading: RUSSO
dialog: Clever. What's your name?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: June.
speaker_heading: RUSSO
dialog: Tell me, June, what did your friend
dialog: say that you found so offensive?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: He compared me to his mother.
speaker_heading: RUSSO
dialog: Unforgivable. How ‘bout I find a
dialog: couple glasses of Champagne, meet
dialog: you on the terrace in, say, fifteen . 3
dialog: minutes? s
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RUSSO
dialog: No?
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Make it five.
text: She walks away, Russo watching every lovely step.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE PARTY
text: She looks around for Milner. He comes up behind her.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Well done.
dialog: (hands her a key)
dialog: I’1l meet you back at the
dialog: apartment. You better get going.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Right now? But I’m all dressed up.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (takes her in)
dialog: Yes, you are. And it’s just fine
dialog: with me if you stay that way until
dialog: I get back. But this next part, I
dialog: gotta do alone. And I don’t wanna
dialog: be distracted like I am right now.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So I'm distracting...?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Go on, get outta here.
scene_heading: EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT
text: June skips down the steps, smiling. She feels confident,
text: looks great. As she hits the bottom step, TWO MENACING
text: FIGURES with buzz-cuts appear in front of her.
scene_heading: MENACING FIGURE
dialog: June Holyfield?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I‘m afraid you have the wrong
dialog: person.
text: She tries to walk around him. The man steps in front of her.
scene_heading: MENACING FIGURE
dialog: Get in the car.
text: He opens his jacket to reveal A BIG GUN.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: MENACING FIGURE
dialog: Please.
scene_heading: EXT. MUSEUM - TERRACE - NIGHT
text: Russo stands alone by the balustrade, optimistically holding
text: two flutes of champagne.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Salvatore...
text: Russo, startled, turns to see Milner standing before him.
speaker_heading: . MILNER
dialog: E piacevole vederli ancora.
text: Russo breaks out into a grin.
speaker_heading: RUSSO
dialog: And you, Milner. Are you here on
dialog: business or pleasure this time?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Little of both. I’ve got something
dialog: for you. .
speaker_heading: RUSSO
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: The battery?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: No, unfortunately. Something else.
text: Milner reaches into his jacket pocket.
scene_heading: EXT. US EMBASSY - ROME - NIGHT
text: The two’menacing men escort June out of the car and whisk her
text: into the building past US MARINES, who stand at attention.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - US EMBASSY - ROME - NIGHT
text: June's heels ECHO on the marble floor as she’s led down the
text: imposing hallway.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - US EMBASSY - NIGHT
text: June enters to see a WOMAN, typing on her computer, her back
dialog: to June.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: 18,500 Euros. That was quite the
dialog: shopping spree you had today.
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
text: The woman turns around to face June.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I‘m FBI Director Isabelle George.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Look, this whole thing is just a
dialog: big misunderstanding.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: Which part of aiding and abetting a
dialog: known enemy of the state am I not
dialog: understanding?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You’re talking about the battery.
dialog: Milner’s just trying to keep it
dialog: safe.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: Really?
text: Director George stands up.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: Four days ago, Milner was given
dialog: strict orders to bring it in, but
dialog: he never showed up. Since then,
dialog: he‘s been trying to arrange an
dialog: international auction to sell it to
dialog: the highest bidder.
speaker_heading: _ JUNE.
dialog: No, that’s what Ackerman is doing!
text: Director George presses a button.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: I assume Milner told you Ackerman
dialog: was rogue FBI?
text: Ackerman steps out of an inner door, startling June.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: But the truth is he’s my best field
dialog: agent. :
dialog: 
text: June stares at Ackerman, stunned.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: Ask yourself, Ms. Holyfield: Has
dialog: Milner said one thing that you can
dialog: prove to be true?
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (to Ackerman)
dialog: He said you were going to kill me.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Yet here you are.
text: June doesn’t know what to say.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE °
dialog: Now, it’s time you started telling
dialog: the truth.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I am. Look, Milner’s not a bad
dialog: guy. He’s just working undercover
dialog: for the ITA.
text: Director George and Ackerman stare at her blankly.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: The International Intelligence
dialog: Agency. You know, it’s a big, top-
dialog: secret, international spy...
dialog: thing...
text: Director George and Ackerman exchange a look.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: Ms. Holyfield, I have a security
dialog: clearance unrivaled by anyone else
dialog: on the planet. And I’ve never
dialog: heard of any organization by that
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (getting worried)
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: What I have heard of is the New
dialog: Freedom Coalition. What has Milner
dialog: told you about them?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: The-- Nothing--
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: We know that they’re trying to
dialog: destabilize the Middle East--
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Isn't it already pretty unstable?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: They're going after our allies, the
dialog: Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the UAE...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Milner’s never said a word about
dialog: the New... whatever--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: --Freedom Coalition. Yet you
dialog: attended one of their events
dialog: tonight...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: We know they’re raising money for
dialog: something. I want to know what.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Milner just wanted to meet a guy
dialog: named Salvatore Russo to give him
dialog: the battery.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: Give him the battery? Would you
dialog: like to see what he actually gave
dialog: Mr. Russo?
text: She indicates a video monitor. Ackerman switches on a
dialog: surveillance tape of
speaker_heading: ON THE MONITOR
text: Milner stands with Russo on the roof as in the previous
text: scene.- Milner reaches into his jacket pocket... then pulls a
text: gun and shoots Russo dead.
text: June watches the tape, horror-struck.
speaker_heading: JUNE :
dialog: No... that’s impossible.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
text: He’s still in possession of the
dialog: battery. You see, he’s lied to you
dialog: again. What are you up to, Ms..
dialog: Holyfield?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Nothing... I’m just...
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: The last time I saw you, you said
dialog: you had nothing to do with Milner.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I didn’t-- I just met him--
text: Director George hits the remote again and we see security
text: camera footage of June with Russo...
speaker_heading: RUSSO (ON TAPE)
dialog: How ‘bout I find a couple glasses
dialog: of Champagne, meet you on the
dialog: terrace in, say, fifteen minutes?
speaker_heading: JUNE (ON TAPE)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RUSSO (ON TAPE)
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: JUNE (ON TAPE)
dialog: Make it five.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Okay, that was just me being in the
dialog: moment-—
text: They both just look back at her.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: I gotta say, from where we stand,
dialog: you're starting to look a lot less
text: like an innocent bystander and a
dialog: lot more like Milner’s partner.
speaker_heading: JUNE .
dialog: You have no proof--
dialog: (then)
dialog: Besides the tape I mean.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN :
dialog: The proof is you’re still alive.
text: June shifts nervously in her seat as Ackerman sits down close
text: to her.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: I wonder, what is it you have that
dialog: Milner wants?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: Well, for some reason, he seems. to
dialog: trust you. So here’s what you're
dialog: going to do: the next time you get
dialog: a visual on the battery, you'll
dialog: give us a signal, and we'll take it
dialog: from there.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: With all due respect, you’re making
dialog: a mistake.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: (losing patience)
dialog: Here’s the deal, Miss Holyfield.
dialog: You’re looking at life in a prison
dialog: that technically doesn't exist.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I want a lawyer.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: Too bad. You can’t have one. Life
dialog: as you know it is now over. You
dialog: may think you’re in Rome, but if
dialog: you decide not to cooperate with
dialog: us, you were never in Rome or
dialog: anywhere else for that matter.
dialog: Because contrary to what you may
dialog: believe, this world is flat and you
text: can fall off the edge.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: And that’s if Milner doesn’t kill
dialog: you first. And make no mistake,
dialog: when he’s ready, he will kill you.
text: June reels. Thinks a moment. Ackerman sets a BLACK BALL-
text: POINT pen down on the desk.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
text: It’s both a bug and a transmitter.
dialog: Once Milner’s... compromised, click
dialog: the pen three times and we'll come
text: knocking on the door.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Three times... don’t I have to say
dialog: “There's no place like home” first?
text: No one laughs. She sighs, picks up the pen, stares at it.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: As long as you have the pen, we'll
dialog: hear everything, so you'll be safe.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: And if I do this?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: You get your life back.
scene_heading: INT. CAB - NIGHT
text: As June considers the PEN Director George gave her. She
text: drops it into her clutch, looks out the window as the cab
text: passes the Trevi Fountain, couples sitting there, kissing.
text: June looks out, turns away.
scene_heading: EXT. ROME SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: June gets out of the cab, stares up at the building. She
text: takes a breath, starts for the entrance.
scene_heading: INT. ROME SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: June walks in as Milner makes a cappuccino from a machine.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: There you are! I was starting to
dialog: get worried.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Just doing a little sightseeing.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (hands her cup)
dialog: Here. You haven’t had a cappuccino
dialog: until you’ve had one in Rome.
text: He turns away and starts to prepare another cappuccino for
text: himself as she sits and stares at him.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So... did you find Russo?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: How did it go?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Good, not great.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: But you gave him the battery,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Not exactly.
text: June’s face falls, but Milner doesn’t see it.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So you’ve still got it.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I didn’t trust him after all.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Do you trust anybody?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: It’s my job not to. Hey, what do
dialog: you say we take a little break
dialog: tomorrow and check out the
dialog: Colosseum?
text: He sits across from her.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You have no intention of handing
dialog: over the battery to anyone, do you?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Not until it’s safe.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: When will it be safe, John?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I’1ll know it when I feel it.
text: June stares at him and makes a decision.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Let me see it again.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: The battery. If you really still
dialog: have it, then show me.
text: Milner hesitates, then reaches into his pocket and places the
text: battery on the table before them.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Hard to believe a thing that small
dialog: could ruin so many lives.
text: CLOSE ON June’s hand behind her back, clicking the ball-point
dialog: pen.
text: Milner stares back at her, then looks at his cup. We see
text: what he sees: the cappuccino begins to tremble ever so
text: slightly. He shakes his head, slowly.
speaker_heading: MILNER (CONT'D)
dialog: It hurts a lot more than I thought.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: The knife you just stuck in my
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You knew?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: It’s my job to know.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Don’t pretend to be hurt. It’s all
dialog: “just business” to you, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: No. Not when it comes to you.
text: He looks sincere. June’s uncertain.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You killed him. How could you just
dialog: do that?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: He was starting to suspect me. He
dialog: was going to compromise my mission.
dialog: It was either his life or millions
dialog: of others. I had no choice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I just want out, Milner. I don’t
dialog: know who to believe anymore.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I never wanted you to believe me,
dialog: June. I just wanted you to trust
dialog: me.
text: Milner takes the battery and puts it back in his pocket, then
text: walks to a door, takes out a key, and opens it to reveal a
text: WEAPONS CACHE inside -- guns of all shapes and sizes.
text: He arms himself, then looks at her.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I should've left you in the car
dialog: with Ackerman. I should've never
dialog: come back for you.
text: Suddenly, the windows in the apartment explode and the room
text: starts to fill with GAS.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: INT. ROME SAFE HOUSE BUILDING - HALLWAY - SAME
text: Milner and June burst through the door.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: C’mon!
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Are you crazy? I’m not going with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You'll be safer.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: No, I won’t.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Yes, you will.
text: A SWAT TEAM emerges from the staircase at the end of the
text: hallway and starts SHOOTING at both of them.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (pissed, to Milner)
dialog: Don’t say it.
text: Milner fires back at the SWAT team and shoves June out a
text: window, onto a fire escape.
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT
text: Milner joins June. As they start to hurry down, GUNMAN shoot
text: up at them from the street below.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Wrong way.
text: They start going up instead, the SWAT TEAM following them.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: Milner pulls June off the fire escape onto the rooftop and
text: starts running, holding her hand.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Hang on!
text: June’s eyes go wide as she realizes -- this is a running
text: start. They race towards the edge of the building... and
dialog: jump!
scene_heading: EXT. ADJACENT ROOF - NIGHT
text: They land, rolling on the roof and scrambling to their feet.
text: As the SWAT TEAM reaches the other rooftop and fires at them,
text: they take cover behind a concrete barrier.
text: Milner returns fire, a gun in each hand.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: These are the kind of moments I’m
dialog: not going to miss.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Just stay calm.
text: The barrier above them explodes in gunfire. He fires off.a
text: few shots.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: No, I won't stay calm. Because
dialog: normal people don’t stay calm in
dialog: situations like this.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I'm calm. Are you implying I'm not
dialog: normal?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Oh, no, you’re completely normal.
dialog: Just your average, everyday
dialog: borderline sociopath.
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
text: He fires off a few more shots. ‘
speaker_heading: " MILNER
dialog: That hurts, June. Deeply.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Oh, that is so you. You know what
dialog: your problem is? You repress all
dialog: your feelings until they just
dialog: explode out of you in fits of
dialog: spontaneous crying or the need to
dialog: shoot something. You’re damaged,
dialog: Milner.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You want to talk about my emotional
dialog: state? Fine. Let’s talk.
text: He. lays down his guns on the floor.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I may not wallow in my feelings and
dialog: cry during chick flicks like most
dialog: people, but it’s because I don’t
dialog: have that luxury.
text: Bullets fly all around them. June gets nervous.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I understand. Absolutely. Could
dialog: you pick up the guns, please?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Do you understand, June? Really?
dialog: Because I have the fate of the free
dialog: world in my hands. That means my
dialog: judgment can’t be impaired by the
dialog: constant randomness of emotions.
text: More bullets fly.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Uh-huh. Can we just put a pin in
dialog: this for now?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: See, my job entails a little more
dialog: than just getting people coffee in
dialog: the morning.
text: That gets to her.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: JUNE .
dialog: How dare you! Just because I don’t
dialog: kill anybody in my job doesn’t mean
dialog: it’s not important.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I‘m not saying it’s not important.
dialog: I‘m just saying you’re capable of a
dialog: hell of a lot more. x
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I don’t need career advice from an
dialog: emotional cripple!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Okay, that’s it! You want your
dialog: life back? Fine!
text: He takes out the battery and shoves it in her hand.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: This is what they want.
text: She looks at him, shocked.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Give it to them. Tell them you
dialog: stole it off me.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Milner--
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You wanna go home? Get your life
dialog: back? This is the only way. Take
dialog: it. And your passport...
text: Milner pulls out her passport and hands it to her.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: At least you got one stamp.
text: He grabs his guns off the ground, then shoots his way over to
text: the roof‘s ledge. He gives her one last look, then leaps
text: over the side.
dialog: 
text: June hurries to the ledge to see him land on top of a passing
dialog: bus.
text: He rises to his feet on the roof of the moving bus, then
text: jumps off onto a DELIVERY GUY on a Vespa, knocking him over.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (to the Delivery Guy)
dialog: Sorry, man.

speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE

speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: Are you alright, Ms. Holyfield?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (looking after Milner)
dialog: I don’t know.
text: She holds out the battery.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I stole it from him.
text: Director George looks at her, gently takes it from her hand.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE
dialog: You did-the right thing. It’s
dialog: over.
text: Director George hands the battery to Ackerman.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GEORGE

scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - JUNE’S FLOOR - MORNING
text: June sets the coffees and baked goods on various desks, then

dialog: her...
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER
dialog: Hey, June.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Morning, Ronnie. I left you a soy
dialog: latte -- non fat, no sugar -- on
dialog: your desk and I’m sorry about the
dialog: last few days...
speaker_heading: CO-WORKER
dialog: Oh...
dialog: (holds up a coffee)
dialog: I already got one, but thanks. And
dialog: what’re you sorry for?
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Well, I wasn’t here and--
text: And now ANOTHER CO-WORKER sits down.
scene_heading: ANOTHER CO-WORKER
dialog: Really? You tock some time off,
dialog: huh?
text: June stands there, wounded, as the realization hits her --
text: no one noticed she was gone.
text: She looks over at the 50-something woman, sitting down to
text: work at her cubicle, her desk clock beside her. The woman
text: sees June staring at it.
scene_heading: 50-SOMETHING WOMAN
dialog: (re: desk clock)
text: It’s already broken.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: That’s too bad.
scene_heading: 50-SOMETHING WOMAN
dialog: Eh, it was good while it lasted.
dialog: So where'd you go?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What? Oh. Italy. And some
dialog: tropical island... somewhere.
scene_heading: 50-SOMETHING WOMAN
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Ooo! Why’d you come back?

scene_heading: InT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Milner sits at a table, putting together explosive devices
text: and wiring detonators. He speaks to someone O.S.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: She actually accused me of being an
dialog: emotional cripple. You ever heard
dialog: anything more ridiculous? TI told
text: her, emotional detachment is a
dialog: necessary part of the job. But
text: it's like she didn’t even hear it.
dialog: How can she drive me so nuts? I
dialog: swear, I've been off my game since
dialog: the moment I met her.
dialog: (then, considering)
dialog: Still, I guess the question is why
dialog: do I do the job in the first place,
dialog: you know? And the truth is, it’s
dialog: all I’ve got. That’s why I can do
dialog: it so well... because I don’t have
dialog: anything else to care about. When
dialog: you don’t have anybody, you've got
dialog: nothing to lose, right?
dialog: (then, realizing)
dialog: But if I’ve been off my game, and I
dialog: have... maybe it’s because I’ve
dialog: finally found something I don’t
dialog: want to lose.
text: He gathers up the devices in a backpack.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I really appreciate you letting me
dialog: talk this out with you. Thanks,
dialog: man.
text: We WIDEN to see that Milner has been talking to a huge

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Actually, make it a bourbon.

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Another.
text: He pours her another. She sits there, feeling out of sorts.
text: She pulls out her passport and opens it up.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: At least I got one stamp.
text: She examines the stamp, when a puzzled look crosses her face.
scene_heading: ON THE PASSPORT
text: It's not an Italian stamp, but a stamped picture of an IGLOO
text: and, beneath it, the numbers “64 14 23 153 37 03.”
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Milner...
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Hey, these numbers mean anything to

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Longitude 64, 14, 23. Latitude \

text: He turns to his computer, where we see his screen displays

text: back, grabbing Cosmo.
text: -- In her apartment, June tosses her various tasteful-yet-
text: bland outfits from her closet into onto a large pile in the
text: middie of her floor. Finally, she stands in the closet
text: amidst empty racks. She looks determined.
text: -- In a department store, June tries on various “spy” outfits
dialog: with no luck -- one’s too bulky, the next too “army surplus,”
dialog: another too constricting, etc.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON JUNE’S FACE

scene_heading: INT. DARK ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: JUNE

speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Look, I don’t know if you’re the

text: The Man looks on, incredulous.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Honestly, if this was last week, we
dialog: might be having a whole different
dialog: conversation here. But a lot’s
dialog: happened to me since then. So,
dialog: really, I only have two words for
dialog: you... bite me.
text: The Man nods to one of his cohorts, who grabs June’s arm,

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What is that? Heroin?! Is that
dialog: heroin?! You're gonna turn me into
dialog: a junkie?!
speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I mean, I always thought she was
dialog: just irresponsible, ever since I
dialog: was a kid, and I didn’t want to be

speaker_heading: MILNER (0.S.)
speaker_heading: JUNE!

speaker_heading: MILNER

speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Sodium something.

dialog: June’s head...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You work alone and live alone. So
dialog: in the end, I’d be... alone, right?
text: A GRENADE rolls down the corridor... Milner quickly throws
text: his body against a door, crashes into...
speaker_heading: AN OFFICE
text: Pulling June to the floor as the explosion rips through the
text: corridor... They lie on the floor together, she looks at him.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I don’t even know who you are. I
dialog: mean, not really.
text: Milner stands, pulls her to Her feet, picks up metal desk
text: chair, throws it through the window as June prattles on.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I mean, sure, you’re obviously
dialog: suave and smart and you've great
dialog: taste in clothes. Except for your
dialog: shoes.
text: Milner looks offended.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: What’s wrong with my shoes? These
dialog: are Ferragamo.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Don’t go with the outfit.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Yes, they do!
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: The point is, I don’t know if you
dialog: -can have ever anyone else in your
dialog: life. But I guess we should just
dialog: enjoy the time we’ve got together.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
text: He lifts her up to the window... she starts to climb out,
text: looks back at him.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: June--
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: And you are really sexy.
text: GUNSHOTS RIP INTO THE OFFICE...
speaker_heading: MILNER.
dialog: Go!
text: She goes out the window and Milner turns around flips over
text: the desk, gets behind it and takes out the two GUNMEN...
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: BRIGHT SUN as Milner hurries June away from the remote
text: warehouse, which we now see is in the midst of an icy
text: wilderness. Milner hops on a waiting snowmobile, pulls the
text: groggy June on behind him.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Hold on.
text: June wraps her arms around him as he fires up the snowmobile
text: and speeds away. She rests her head against Milner’s back,
text: smiling blissfully, then closes her eyes and drifts off to
dialog: sleep.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - DAY
text: Through binoculars, someone watches Milner and June speed
text: away on the snowmobile.
scene_heading: EXT. ALASKAN COMPOUND - DAY
text: An isolated, military-like compound sits hidden away amidst
text: the snowy mountains.
scene_heading: INT. COMPOUND GUEST ROOM - DAY
text: June awakens, looks around to find herself in a well-
text: appointed bedroom -- satin sheets, tasteful furniture, etc.
text: She takes in the strange surroundings and grins.
dialog: She’s getting used to this.
text: On a nightstand next to her lies a handwritten note. She
text: picks it up. It reads: “JUNE, STAY PUT. BUT IF YOU CAN’T,
scene_heading: THERE’S A MACHINE GUN IN THE DRAWER. -- XOXO, MILNER”
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
text: She opens the drawer to reveal a MACHINE GUN.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: June emerges from the bedroom, holding the machine gun
text: tentatively. She makes her way down the hall, when she hears
text: MALE VOICES approaching down an adjoining hallway up ahead.
text: She ducks for cover in a doorway as the BURLY GUYS walk past,
text: then stealthily continues on.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Just stand by a doorway leading into a main hall. She peers
text: inside. It’s filled with INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSMEN and DICK
text: CHENEY-TYPES. Just then, she hears a DEEP VOICE right behind
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DEEP VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: What are you doing here?!
text: June whirls around, raises her machine gun. It’s just
text: Milner, doing a voice. He laughs.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Don‘t do that.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Sorry. You know, for a woman who
dialog: hates guns, you look pretty hot
dialog: packing one.
text: She hands the machine gun to him.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Don’t worry. We're safe with my
text: peeps.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Your “peeps”? You mean the IIA?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: The whats-it?
dialog: (then, remembering)
dialog: Ohhh... Actually, I kinda made that
dialog: up. I’m talking about my real
dialog: peeps. Come on, I’1l introduce
dialog: you...
text: He leads her into the adjoining room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HALL - DAY
text: The gathered INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSMEN smile warmly at Milner
text: and June as the two enter.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: June, may I present the New Freedom
dialog: Coalition -- or the NFC, for short.
dialog: Not to be confused with the
dialog: National Football Conference, who,
dialog: for the most part, have no
dialog: aspirations of global domination.
text: Milner pulls her hand from him, then turns to a SCIENTIST.
speaker_heading: MILNER (CONT’D)
dialog: This is Dr. Raj. He's reverse-
dialog: engineering the battery for us.
text: Milner pulls the battery out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: But... you gave me the battery.
text: Milner looks sheepish.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Busted! Sorry, June. That was a
dialog: fake. I had to get the real one up
dialog: here ASAP so we could move on to
dialog: Phase Two.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Phase Two?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Production.
text: He sets the battery down on a table.
speaker_heading: DR. RAJ
dialog: We're going to make thousands of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: And here's the kicker. Once we
dialog: start the big war in the Middle
dialog: East and choke off the world’s oil
dialog: supply -- BAM! -- we appear with
dialog: the solution. We’re going to be
dialog: bazillionaires.
dialog: (then)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: MILNER. (cont'd)
dialog: I know that’s not really a number,
dialog: but when we’re in charge, we’ll
dialog: make it one.-
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I don’t understand.
speaker_heading: DR. RAJ
dialog: My dear, it’s very simple. Once we
dialog: destabilize the global economy, we
dialog: can use our power to build a better
dialog: world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Sure, there might be a little
dialog: widespread panic and general
dialog: mayhem. But you can’t make a “free-
text: world frittata” without breaking a
dialog: few eggs, right?
text: The others chuckle.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Why did you bring me here?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You helped us throw off the FBI,
dialog: Ackerman, the worse guys, and God-
dialog: knows-who-else. You’ve proven
dialog: yourself. We want you in the club.
text: He takes her hands, earnestly. .
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I want you in the club. I always
dialog: knew you were meant for great
dialog: things. What do you say?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I come all this way around the
dialog: world to find you -- and this is
dialog: who you are?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: June, think about it. The world is
dialog: falling apart. We’re offering
dialog: mankind a second chance. These are
dialog: the good guys.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: No. These are just a bunch of
text: twisted, greedy, evil assholes.
dialog: And you’re one of them.
dialog: 100.
text: The other NFC members exchange worried glances.
speaker_heading: DR. RAJ
dialog: Milner, do we have a problem here?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (waves them off)
dialog: We’re cool, we're cool... June, I
dialog: have to say, you’re being. just a
dialog: liiiittle bit ungrateful. Think
dialog: about this. I mean, really think
dialog: about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Screw you.
speaker_heading: DR. RAJ
dialog: Milner...
text: Milner sighs wearily.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You disappoint me, June.
text: He pulls a gun and points it at her. She’s defiant.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Go ahead. It’s really been “just
dialog: business” to you all along, hasn't
dialog: it?
text: Milner stares her down coldly, his gun steady, his finger
text: tightening on the trigger, when they hear the sound of a
text: ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE being fired.
dialog: ; DR. J
dialog: RPG!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Ackerman. Get down!
text: A missile hits the room and EXPLODES. All hell breaks loose.
text: Everyone’s sent sprawling to the floor as the lights go out,
text: debris falls from the ceiling, etc.
speaker_heading: nm
text: June takes advantage of the distraction. She grabs the
text: battery off the floor and races out the door. Milner
dialog: notices.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: June!
text: He goes after her as a KLAXON blares.
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: EXT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: June turns a corner and races down the hallway. Milner runs
dialog: after her.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: June, wait!
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Get away from me!
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY - DAY
text: June bursts out onto the huge balcony, built against the
text: mountainside. The view is breathtaking, the drop-off over
text: the railing hundreds of feet to the ground below.
text: . Milner is in pursuit. June heads for a’door across the
text: balcony, but stops short when she sees --
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
text: Bursting through the doorway ahead, gun drawn, aiming at
dialog: Milner.
text: She ducks between two large columns to get out of the line of
dialog: fire. .
text: Ackerman shoots as Milner dives for cover.
text: Bullets fly in both directions on the balcony before her, as
text: the two men engage in a fierce gun battle. She puts the
text: battery in her pocket, desperately looks around for a way
text: out. There are no other exits. She stands there, at a loss,
dialog: when --
text: She hears the sound of a CLANK, CLANK on the floor nearby.
scene_heading: A LIVE: GRENADE
text: Skitters to a stop right before her.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (sees it)
dialog: Great.
text: June desperately reaches out for the grenade, trying to stay
text: protected from the firefight. Her fingers finally land on
dialog: it.
text: She CHUCKS it towards Milner’s end of the balcony, then ducks
text: back between the columns as the grenade EXPLODES.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
text: Milner loses his gun in the blast, debris raining down on
dialog: him.
text: Between the columns, June waits nervously. Ackerman steps
text: before her.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: _ Ms. Holyfield?
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: A bloodied MILNER hits him from the side, knocking Ackerman‘s
text: gun from his hands.
text: The two men tear into each other. June picks up.Ackerman’s
text: gun off the floor, as Milner and Ackerman’s brawl SLAMS them
text: against the balcony’s railing. Damaged by the grenade, the
text: railing gives way.
text: Milner lies half over the side of the balcony, with Ackerman
text: on top of him, his fingers locked around Milner’s throat.
text: June pulls Milner’s gun from the debris.
text: Milner struggles to free himself from Ackerman’s chokehold,
text: then kicks him off, sending him flying across the balcony.
text: As the two men stagger to their feet, ready to continue the
dialog: battle -- :
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: STOP!!!
text: June steps between them, her arms spread wide, a gun in each
text: hand, aiming at the two men in both directions.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Just... stop.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Easy there, June. You hate guns,
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You know what I hate more? Liars!
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Ms. Holyfield, I’m here with the
dialog: FBI. We tracked Milner and the NFC
dialog: here to shut them down for good.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: That’s bullshit, June. He’s not
dialog: here with the FBI. He’s here with
dialog: his clients -- the Worse Guys.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: MILNER (cont'd)
dialog: They want the battery to power
dialog: weapons. The kind that can fit in
text: a suitcase. —
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: So what? You’re with the other bad
dialog: guys!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: No, I’m not! I swear to you! I
dialog: just infiltrated the NFC as part of
dialog: my mission.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: That’s absurd. Don’t fall for it!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: That's why I left you the stamp in
dialog: your passport. I knew Ackerman and
dialog: his clients would follow you here.
dialog: Do you know how hard it is to get
dialog: all the bad guys in the same place?
text: June is skeptical.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Ms. Holyfield, listen to me. We’ll
dialog: get you out of here. You can still
dialog: go back to your old life. For
dialog: God's sake, don’t let him use you
dialog: again. .
text: It sounds convincing. June is torn.
speaker_heading: . MILNER
dialog: June... you know the real reason I
dialog: chose you when I saw.you in the
dialog: window of that restaurant? Because
dialog: you looked lonely. And I know what
dialog: lonely looks like.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: He’s trying to get inside your
dialog: head. That’s what he does. Don’t
dialog: ‘let him!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You were wrong, June. What you
dialog: said when the worse guys drugged
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Uh... what did I say?
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: That I could never have anyone in
dialog: my life. That if we got together,
dialog: you'd wind up alone.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I said that?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Well, that and you think that we'd
dialog: have great sex, but let’s stay on
dialog: target--
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I did not say that.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: The point is, you’re all I’ve been
dialog: able to think about, ever since I
dialog: met you.. You’re the best partner
dialog: I've ever had, in every conceivable
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Just-- what do you want, Milner?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I want this first date to go on
dialog: forever.
text: She looks: him in the eyes a beat -- he’s never looked more
text: serious. She makes her decision.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (to Milner)
dialog: I don’t believe you...
text: Milner looks wounded. Ackerman smiles in relief.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (to Milner)
dialog: ..-but I trust you.
dialog: 
text: She shoots Ackerman, then goes to Milner. He takes her in
text: his arms, just as -- :
text: A GROUP OF ARMED WORSE GUYS
text: Step out onto the balcony. Ackerman, clutching his gunshot
text: wound, calls to them.
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: (re: Milner and June)
dialog: Take ‘em out!
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Milner...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Don’t worry. I got it.
text: He calmly pulls out a detonation device in his hand.
text: The opposite end of the balcony EXPLODES, and the Worse Guys
dialog: go flying.
text: We hear other CHARGES he’s set around the compound GOING OFF,
dialog: when --
speaker_heading: COMMANDOS
text: Rappel down onto the balcony on.ropes from above and swarm in
text: from every door, armed to the teeth. They all wear matching
text: uniforms, emblazoned with a LOGO that resembles the famous
text: shot of the earth rising over the moon.
text: They drag Ackerman and the surviving Worse Guys out of the
text: rubble, swiftly and efficiently disarming them and taking
dialog: them down.
text: June looks on, amazed.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: The IIA?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: We're the Watchdogs of the World.
text: June smiles, relieved. He kisses her.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You know, I’m glad you decided to
dialog: trust me before they showed up,
dialog: because that would have made your
dialog: choice ridiculously easy.
text: The commando LEADER drops beside Milner and removes his
text: goggles. We recognize him as the Maitre D’ from the
dialog: restaurant where they first met.
speaker_heading: LEADER :
text: Johnny Milner does it again.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: You were supposed to be here at
dialog: 0800! I had to do it all by
dialog: myself.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: No, it was 0900...
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Don‘t you remember the plan?
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: There was a plan?
scene_heading: INT. MEETING HALL
text: June follows Milner into the wrecked room, amazed, as the IIA
text: commandos round up and drag away the last of the bad guys
text: around them -- the New Freedom Coalition, their Guards, and
dialog: the Worse Guys.
text: Sporadic MACHINE GUN FIRE continues elsewhere in the compound
text: as Milner grabs a bottle of wine and a couple of glasses that
text: have miraculously made it through the mayhem.
text: He checks the wine label. Impressed, he pours them both a
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: (hands her glass)
dialog: Admit it. This was the best first
dialog: date you've ever had.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: It's up there.
text: They toast and drink.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: So -- wanna do it again?
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Maybe. Call me. I don’t want to
text: come off desperate.
text: Milner grins.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Oh! I almost forgot...
text: June takes out the battery and hands it to Milner.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Here. Keep it safe.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Yeah, about that... this one’s not
dialog: real, either.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Then where is the real one?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Nowhere. It hasn’t actually been
dialog: invented yet.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I mean, they’re working on it, but
text: it’s still a ways off. But now
dialog: when it is invented, we will have
dialog: already taken out all the guys who
dialog: were going to go after it. See how
dialog: it works? °
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: My brain hurts.
speaker_heading: : MILNER
dialog: You get used to it.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. REMOTE TROPICAL POOL - DAY
text: Like in the Mate-dot-com ad. Only now, Milner dives into
text: pool, swims under the water, surfaces to where June waits
text: kisses her...
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: You know, it may be time for you to
dialog: meet my mom.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I'd love to. Is she like you?
text: June thinks, then...
speaker_heading: . JUNE
dialog: Yeah. She is.
dialog: the
dialog: and
text: Just then, across the grounds, June hears the ROAR of several
text: jeeps pull up beside a thatched-roof boathouse.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Uh-oh...
text: A couple DRUG LORD-types and their entourage of armed
text: BODYGUARDS emerge from the jeeps and enter the boathouse.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Time for work.
text: Milner climbs out of the pool, as June reaches into a beach
text: bag and pulls out two enormous MACHINE GUNS.
dialog: She hands one
text: to Milner, along with some CLIPS.
text: They lock and load as they
text: approach the boathouse.
dialog: .
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: What are you making for dinner
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Steak au poivre.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: I love steak au poivre!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I know.
text: They share a quick kiss. Milner kicks in the door of the
text: boathouse, as the two burst in, GUNS BLAZING, and we...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:
