dialog: RAGE OF THE WEREWOLF
dialog: Written by Santo Marotta & Kevin Lindenmuth
dialog: 11/25/98 4th draft - Copyright 1998
dialog: CAMERA PANS DOWN from stars to the Earth.
dialog: NARRATOR
dialog: On August 12th, 2001, scientists discovered that a meteorite was on a Collision course with the earth.
dialog: The large meteorite is hurtling towards the earth…
dialog: NARRATOR
dialog: Nuclear weapons were used in an attempt to destroy the deadly meteorite.
dialog: Show explosion on meteor—it breaks up into a few chunks.
dialog: NARRATOR
dialog: Although they did not destroy it completely they did manage to knock it
dialog: Off course, sending it crashing into the moon´s surface. The impact was so
dialog: Powerful that it changed the moon´s orbit, bringing it closer to earth. As a result the weather was affected, tides increased but the most astounding thing that happened was
dialog: The strange biological change certain people underwent.
dialog: Sky shot of full moon pans down to New York City—and we hear the howling of many many wolves.
dialog: CREDITS:
scene_heading: EXT. TIME´S SQUARE, NYC—EARLY MORNING
dialog: GRAPHIC: 2010
text: JAKE and RALPH, two men in their 30´s, walk across an empty intersection. Both are a bit bedraggled looking. Ralph stops, looking in the plastic bag he carries. He stops when he feels JAKE staring at him.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: I´m just making sure that I didn´t forget any of the cans—
dialog: JAKE still stares at him, disapproving.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: What? What are you looking at?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: You´re such a hyena…
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Hey, I´m not the only one scavenging, here…
dialog: JAKE
dialog: You´re right.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: You want to eat like a man, dontcha?
dialog: Jake doesn´t answer.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Come on. I don´t like being out in the open like this—
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Me and you can kick anyone´s hairy ass, right?
dialog: Jake looks around, concerned. No one is out.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: C´mon, let´s just go—
text: They continue, walking past abandoned looking buildings. Finally they come to their building but they don´t go through the front way. They go up the fireescape in the back, their secret entrance.
dialog: INT. APARTMENT- DAY
dialog: Their apartment looks like a typical “guys” apartment—messy. Immediately, JAKE senses that there was someone there earlier.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: We had a visitor while we were out.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Doesn´t look like they took anything.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Yeah…I wonder what they wanted.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Who gives a shit. Let´s watch some TV.
text: He turns on the television. The reception is quite good, surprisingly. On the television is the local news—
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER
dialog: In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court has declared New
dialog: York City an “unsafe” zone and is pulling out the remainder of
dialog: the law enforcement by the end of the month. Those who are
dialog: uninfected and are able to leave should do so as soon as possible.
dialog: RALPH interrupts—
dialog: RALPH
dialog: I guess we´re shit out of luck.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Well, I was born and raised here. I don´t want to leave.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Not as safe as it used to be—can´t hide in the crowd anymore.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: You´re Mr. Fucking Know It All, aren´t you?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: I just know the situation I´m in. Just trying to get by—
dialog: As he´s talking his eyes never leave the magazine he´s looking at.
dialog: On the television are scenes of werewolves pillaging and attacking…
dialog: ANCHOR
dialog: With us tonight is Professor Jonathan Hull, the leading expert on the
dialog: Werewolf phenomenon. Professor, what´s your explaination for all this?
speaker_heading: PROF. HULL
dialog: Well, Jim, we´ve established that a certain percentage of the population
dialog: possesses a latent gene that can cause lycanthropy. A sort of unbalance between
dialog: human and animal, if you will. The shifting of the moon´s orbit five years ago has accelerated this dormant gene. Just as the full moon changes the tides and some emotions in people, its influence has now increased to dangerous proportions.
dialog: ANCHOR
dialog: Thank you, Professor. (to camera) So far the disease has been contained
dialog: to several major cities in the US—Las Vegas, Houston, and New York…
dialog: Jake is sick of watching this—he goes into the other room.
dialog: EXT. OF CITY- DUSK
text: Jake and Ralph are walking. Ralph suddenly stops and looks up at the sky, very dramatic.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Wait! Oh, no! The full moon´s coming out! I´m changing again!
dialog: Grrrrr! Get away!
text: Jake looks at Ralph with little reaction as Ralph messes up his hair, tearing his t-shirt under his open coat, growling and jumping around like a fool.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I wish you´d stop with this bullshit you pull every time there´s a full
dialog: Moon out. You´re not a real werewolf so you might as well get over it.
dialog: Ralph continues to act nutty, jumping around like a dog.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: What do ya mean? Look at me, man! I´m a werewolf! I´m dangerous, Jake!
dialog: Jake stares at him and we see Ralph from his perspective. He looks very pathetic.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: You know you should thank God you weren´t affected so much by
dialog: The moon´s orbit. You lucked out but you´re too stupid to realize it!
dialog: Ralph composes himself—seeing that Jake isn´t going to put up with this.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: You know, I´ll take one of those DNA tests right now—it´s proof I have
dialog: The wolf genes—I´ll proove it to you (pause). Oh, come on Jake!
dialog: Why are you being so hard on me? I´m just trying to fit in!
dialog: But Jake holds up a hand for him to be quiet. He hears something.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Shush! Listen.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: What? I don´t hear anything.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Next block. Bounty hunters—they´ve got someone cornered!
dialog: With that, Jake bolts out of frame.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Wait! What an idiot! I can help! Wait!
text: Ralph catches up with Jake who is peeking around a wall at the end of an alleyway. Three or four bounty hunters have a she-wolf cornered. She is growling at them, scared and angry. One of them pulls out a gun and net.
dialog: BOUNTY HUNTER
dialog: Got ya now, bitch. No more running!
text: Jake becomes angry and we see his eyes turn yellow. Before RALPH can stop him he leaps and lands in the alley behind the hunters.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: What an idiot!
dialog: JAKE confronts them.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Leave her alone!
dialog: BOUNTY HUNTER #2
dialog: Jesus, this one can talk!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I do card tricks, too…
text: JAKE ducks into the shadows as bullets go off. The female werewolf , only partially transformed, takes the opportunity to strike at one f her would to captures. More bullets, Jake leaps out of the shadows and slashes some of the hunters. While the ones still alive reach for their weapons, Jake gets hit several times by regular bullets while protecting the she-wolf. RALPH stays hidden—he knows he hasn´t a chance of helping!
dialog: INT. JAKE/RALPH APARTMENT:
dialog: The shewolf is on the couch, out of it, weak from the wounds inflicted by the hunters. If she wasn´t half comatose they would have to tie her down. Most werewolves have no reasoning abilities when they are changed.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: I don´t know why you wanted to bring her here—
dialog: like we don´t have enough problems.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: She´s wounded.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: She´s a wolf. She´ll heal.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: We´re not in an old horror film—if she´s hurt bad
dialog: enough she could die.
dialog: CUT TO: EXT NIGHT
text: A couple, both in their 20´s, are running down the street, looking over their shoulder. They duck around a corner. The guy is DAVE, the woman LISA. Although we may not see it immediately they both wear these gold medallions about their necks that have a pentagram on them.
dialog: LISA
dialog: Why are they doing this to us? Why don´t they
dialog: just leave us alone?
dialog: DAVE
dialog: It´s because they get a thousand bucks for a wolf pelt on
dialog: the black market.
dialog: Lisa looks up at the partially full moon.
dialog: LISA
dialog: It´s not even a full moon yet…we´re not even changed!
dialog: DAVE
dialog: They´ll try to capture us. God knows what they´d do to us
dialog: in a few days…
dialog: LISA
dialog: We should´ve stayed with The Leader, we were protected
dialog: there—
dialog: Dave rolls his eyes.
dialog: DAVE
dialog: Why did we leave him, again?
dialog: LISA
dialog: Because he wanted to fuck me.
dialog: DAVE
dialog: And….
dialog: She throws herself to him, hugging him.
dialog: LISA
dialog: Because I love you!
dialog: DAVE
dialog: He´d have killed me.
dialog: LISA
dialog: We did the right thing…
text: They are both silent for a moment. They can hear the sound of the laughing bounty hunters in the distance. Then, Lisa notices an open door to a nearby building.
dialog: LISA
dialog: Let´s go in there…
text: They do. DAVE goes in first, walking into shadow. But there´s an awful scream and he stumbles back out, one of his arms gone. He falls down. Someone or something throws his wrenched arm after him. Lisa starts screaming but a shape steps out—large—and a hand grabs her, lifting her off of the ground. Her feet twitch in the air. It is LAZLO.
dialog: LAZLO Nobody has their own pack, except me. How DARE you
dialog: try to leave me—are you sorry you made the wrong
dialog: decision?
text: She tries to talk but cant. He puts her back on the ground so she can answer. She looks at DAVE, who is moaning.
dialog: LISA
dialog: It was all my idea to leave—if I go back to you
dialog: will you leave him alone?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: That´s what you wish?
dialog: LISA
dialog: That´s all. Then I´ll go back..
dialog: Quickly the leader goes to DAVE and puts a foot on his head.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: This is what your wishes mean to me—
dialog: And he steps on DAVE´s head, squishing it like a ripe tomatoe.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: You´re next—
dialog: He turns to her—
dialog: CUT TO: LATER/MORNING
dialog: RALPH walks in the front door and JAKE, waking up, sees this.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: What are you doing up so early?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: I…had a hard time sleeping. All this makes me nervous—
dialog: (he gesures to GINA). Very nervous.
text: As they are talking the girl transforms back into her human form, a girl named GINA. She awakens. She looks around, puzzled at the unfamiliar surroundings.
dialog: GINA
dialog: Man, that must´ve been some party. I´ve never
dialog: Woken up with two guys before…
dialog: JAKE
dialog: It wasn´t that kind of party.
dialog: She starts to get up, wobbly.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Lay back down. You need to rest, let your healing factors
dialog: kick in.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Do you remember anything that happened last night?
dialog: GINA
dialog: I do remember you getting shot (to JAKE) You were protecting me, right? But why weren´t you hurt?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: It´s because he´s a SPECIAL werewolf. (he says “Special” like
dialog: You do when you talk about handicapped kids).
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Shut up, Ralph.
dialog: GINA
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: He didn´t get it from the moon´s crazy orbit. He´s cursed.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: What about “shut up” don´t you understand?
dialog: GINA
dialog: Is he telling the truth? Are you cursed?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Boy, is he!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I said SHUT UP!!!
dialog: GINA
dialog: Really, are you cursed?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Yes!
dialog: GINA
dialog: How did it happen?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: It´s a long story.
dialog: GINA
dialog: Well, I´m obviously not going anywhere soon. Like you
dialog: said, I have to let those healing factors kick in.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Okay, fine. It all started one day when my father was a young
dialog: Man. He was out gathering wood in the mountains outside a small town in Italy. He said a beast in man´s clothing attacked him—a werewolf.
dialog: CUT TO: FLASHBACK SCENE where he gets attacked.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: The beast would have killed him if not for an arrow shot by a nearby hunter. For some reason, my father was unaffected, but two of the three children he later had were—my older brother and I. My sister was spared the horrible curse. Laslo and I didn´t feel the effects of the curse until we reached our late teens. One night during a full moon it happened…
dialog: CUT TO FLASHBACK SCENE—where he is changing.
dialog: JAKE
text: At that time, before the change in the moon´s orbit, I had no control over the beast inside me, I couldn´t change at will, only when there was a full moon—like with you. After the many deaths my brother and I committed the townspeople began to suspect my father, having heard the story from the hunter who saved him from the wolf. My parents, my younger sister, were burned alive in our very home. My uncle saw Lazlo and I get to safety by sending us to America. So that´s it, that´s the story.
dialog: GINA
dialog: And that´s why regular bullets can´t hurt you?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I guess only silver bullets can, though I´ve never been shot by one, so I can´t say for sure…
dialog: GINA
dialog: So all those old werewolf legends are true?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Cursed werewolves, bloodsucking vampires and evil demons—they all exist. They´ve just managed to keep themselves hidden from mankind.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Stop it, you´re scaring her.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: She´s a fuckin werewolf, for Christ´s sake!
dialog: JAKE pulls Ralph aside, whispering, though she can still probably hear.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I don´t want you telling her anything else about us, okay?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Okay, Mr. Secret Origin.
dialog: JAKE glares at him.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I don´t want you telling her about our other hideouts or
dialog: Anything. I don´t trust her.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: You´re the one who saved her…
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Doesn´t mean I have to like her.
dialog: He stands up, goes towards the door.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I´m going outside for a while. Don´t make a mess.
dialog: He goes out the front door.
dialog: Ralph and Gina look at the closed door for a moment before she turns to him.
dialog: GINA
dialog: Who bit him in the ass?
dialog: INT. APT. BUILDING: DAY
dialog: Jakes goes down the front stairs of his apartment building and is surprised by what he sees when he gets
text: Down to the front lobby—the door is wide open and there is the corpse of a woman (LISA!), sort of mangled. But that´s not the worst part—there are scavengers—homeless looking people, who are feeding on her, like zombies. These are the individuals who have gone insane from the werewolf transformations and will eat anything. Jake half transforms and growls, scaring them away. He then turns to examine the body…and notices she is clutching something in one of her hands. It is part of one of his T-shirts.
dialog: JAKE What the hell?
dialog: Then he realizes that it was stolen from his apartment yesterday.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Damnit!
text: He briefly looks outside before he shuts the door and runs back up to the apartment.
scene_heading: INT. JAKE/RALPH APARTMENT: DAY
text: As soon as he walks through the door he shuts off the television RALPH and GINA are watching.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: What did you do that for?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Move your hairy ass.
dialog: GINA
dialog: What´s going on?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I went downstairs and there´s a body—all over the place.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Hey, I wouldn´t do that—
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I know, but who would? If those bounty hunters come here
dialog: Are you going to want to deal with them?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Let´s just clean up the mess…
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Too late. There are scavengers already—
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Shit. (he looks around) And I liked living here, too.
dialog: GINA
dialog: What about me? I thought I was supposed to recuperate?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: You´re healed. Now move it. (to RALPH) Get what you need.
dialog: With that Jake goes into the other room. He starts throwing clothes into a duffel bag.
dialog: CUT TO: Various shots of a deserted looking New York city.
speaker_heading: INT. JAKE/RALPH APT. DAY
dialog: Ralph walks into Jake´s room.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: So, who do you think did it?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Well, it´s not a full moon for two more nights and there´s only
dialog: One other person I know who can change at will—
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Why´s he doing this to us?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Because he hates the idea that we won´t join his pack, I suppose. Believe me, we´ve never gotten along.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: I don´t like him.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Makes two of us. I want nothing to do with the asshole.
dialog: EXT. NEW YORK CITY- DAY
text: They leave the apartment building, Ralph and Jake carrying backpacks over their shoulders. Gina follows them. They walk for a while, not talking. Gina walks in front of RALPH and we see that he is enjoying the view, as it were. Then, GINA stops, catches Ralph looking at her.
dialog: GINA
dialog: Look, maybe it´s better I go off on my own. I mean
dialog: I do have a place to stay.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: You want to leave already?
dialog: GINA
dialog: You two are in trouble, right? No offense and thanks for
dialog: saving me and everything but I like the low profile. So, I´m splitting.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Goodbye.
dialog: Jake starts walking.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Hey, are you going to let her go?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: She can do whatever the hell she likes.
dialog: He makes eye contact with her and nods.
dialog: JAKE (to RALPH)
dialog: We´re gonna have a hard enough time without dragging
dialog: someone else along. She has no reason to stick with us.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Well, adios, then.
dialog: Gina waves and starts walking
dialog: GINA
dialog: Thanks, guys.
dialog: They both watch her walk off.
dialog: EXT. JAKE´S APARTMENT:
dialog: The camera pans down to the corpse—but it is a different one than the one JAKE had seen.
text: Two cops stand over the partially eaten corpse. One cop #2, has a device in his hand. It is a DNA matcher, about the size of a cordless phone.
dialog: COP #1
dialog: Look at this mess. This is fucked up! Christ, why do
dialog: They even allow normal people to even live this city?
dialog: The whole place is crawling with those werewolf freaks!
dialog: COP #2
dialog: ` You know why they´re here. They´re all criminals, tax
dialog: violaters, child abusers, you know, the scum of the Earth.
dialog: COP #1
dialog: Yeah, whatever. But to die like this? This has got to be
dialog: The worst way to go, being chewed up alive…
dialog: COP #2
dialog: Hey, check this out.
dialog: He spots the torn piece of clothing in the dead man´s hand.
dialog: COP #2
dialog: Let´s see who this belongs to—
dialog: He uses the DNA matcher on the clothes and a beeping sound is heard a moment later.
dialog: COP #2
dialog: According to the DNA on this the guy who did it
dialog: Is a Jake Malderone.
dialog: Cop looks up at the address on the building.
dialog: COP #2
dialog: Shit. This is the guy´s address, too.
dialog: COP #1
dialog: That´s pretty stupid.
dialog: COP #2
dialog: Well, criminals aren´t usually geniuses. He´s probably
dialog: Long gone by now but we should check it out. I´ll put out an
dialog: APB on him. Maybe one of the other patrols will spot him.
dialog: CUT TO LATER:
text: Jake and Ralph are walking through the alleyways. They are looking for food. Ralph stops by a small metal door by the ground. He opens it up and out pops a bloody head.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: I know we´re trying to be like regular human beings, eat
dialog: like them, but I´m so fuckin hungry right now!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: You stupid bastard. What the fuck is the matter with you?
dialog: Don´t you want to get out of this place? We have to act like them! Christ, you´re not even a real werewolf!
dialog: Then, he senses something.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Wait. Come on, we have company.
text: At that moment we hear the sound of approaching bounty hunters. Jake and Ralph split down the alley and up the fire escape. They get away and head back for their apartment. Outside, from behind some bushes, they see police men walking around, asking questions to people. They find out from a street person , CHARLIE, that someone was murdered outside of Jake´s apartment and they´re looking for him. They find the hobo in a nearby alleyway, getting drunk as usual. They surprise him. He drops the bottle, it smashes and he gets pissed off. CHARLIE is a werewolf affected by the moon.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Hey, Charlie!
dialog: CHARLIE
dialog: Godamn it! You see what you made me do! I outta kill
dialog: You right now you wanna be!
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Just try it old man!
dialog: They are about to go at it when JAKE gets in between. Charlie starts to grow some fangs, etc.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Take it easy, Charlie. Ralph, make sure there aren´t any
dialog: Hunters around..
dialog: He goes.
dialog: CHARLIE
dialog: Jake, how do you put up with that guy?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: It aint easy. What´s going on outside my apartment?
dialog: CHARLIE
dialog: Quit the bullshit, Jake. You know what´s going on. Got
dialog: hungry last night, huh Jake?
dialog: .
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Why don´t you stop fucking around and tell me what´s going on? I can be a lot more formidable than my wanna be friend over there.
dialog: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay, okay. Cops said you killed a norm last night outside
dialog: Your apartment. Looks like he was important, too, some city
dialog: Official.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: That´s impossible. Me and Ralph left yesterday morning.
dialog: And there was a body, but it wasn´t any norm.
dialog: CHARLIE
dialog: Maybe. But they found pieces of your clothes near him. Matched up your saliva with the dna on file.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Shit. I can´t believe he´s doing this to me…
dialog: CHARLIE
dialog: What you be doing?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Just talking to myself.
dialog: CHARLIE
dialog: If it wasn´t you, then whoever did this is sure trying to make
dialog: people think it was.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: It´s probably Lazlo,
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Your brother? Why would he want to frame you?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Because he wants me to join him, he´s insane, wants to take over the city, probably figures with me on the run I´ll eventually join him. Come on, let´s get out of here.
speaker_heading: INT. SENATOR´S OFFICE—DAY:
text: This is the office of Senator Robert McNaughton. He is wearing glasses and a nice suit. He sits at his desk. His secretary buzzes him on the intercom.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (VO)
dialog: Sir, there´s a gentleman on the line by the name of Lazlo.
dialog: He refused to give his last name, says you know him. Shall I
dialog: Transfer the call to your phone?
speaker_heading: McNAUGHTON
dialog: No!! I mean no, that won´t be necessary, I´ll take it on the
dialog: Vivicom. Thank you, Terry.
text: He turns in his swivel chair to face a computer screen, then presses a button. Lazlo appears on the screen.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Hello, Robert, it´s been a while.
speaker_heading: McNAUGHTON
dialog: Not long enough, Lazlo. I told you never to call me here!
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Watch your tone of voice with me little man, least I come there and personally rip your throat out. Are you forgetting who it was that helped put you in that fine office of yours while the rest of us are living like animals? You wouldn´t want me to tell the world that you are a fellow werewolf, would you?
dialog: McNaughton wipes his sweaty brow with a handkerchief.
speaker_heading: McNAUGHTON
dialog: No, no please, I´m sorry. I´m sorry. Please, what can I do
dialog: For you?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: That´s better. I want you to acquire something for me. It
dialog: Might require some doing but I´m sure you can do it.
speaker_heading: McNAUGHTON
dialog: Yes….what is it?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: I have need of a vampire
speaker_heading: McNAUGHTON
dialog: (coughing up his drink) A Vampire? In heaven´s name, why Lazlo? This isn´t another one of your wild sexual escapades, is it?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Heaven has nothing to do with my plans, Richard, and my
dialog: Affairs are of no consequence to you. All that matters is that you obey!
speaker_heading: McNAUGHTON
dialog: But Lazlo, please….
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: No but, Richard! You owe me and now I´m calling in the marker. A simple yes or no.
speaker_heading: McNAUGHTON
dialog: Yes Richard, of course. I´ll make the necessary arrangements and have the body flown out to you.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Excellent. You´ve done well, Richard. Until next time.
dialog: McNaughton shuts off the Vivicom screen.
dialog: McNaughton Can´t wait. (Pause) Where the hell am I going to get a
dialog: Vampire?
dialog: EXT. CITY- DAY
text: Gina is walking alone. She goes into a building, then down the stairs to a long hallway. She looks like she knows where she´s going.
dialog: INT. LAZLO´s OFFICE:
text: There´s a knock on his door and he looks up but doesn´t answer. The knock is harder this time.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Come in.
text: The door opens and in steps GINA. Her personality is a bit different—more evil. She sits down in the chair, looking at him.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: So?
dialog: GINA
dialog: So, are you going to at least thank me?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: For doing your job?
dialog: She stares at him.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: You´re right. You do have my thanks—
text: He pushes a few buttons on his computer keyboard and a grid of the city comes up. A dot glows. He points to it—
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: I know exactly where he is now—and it looks like
dialog: He´s on his way. (PAUSE) Was it hard deceiving them?
dialog: GINA
dialog: Your brother has this annoying compulsion to help
dialog: People. It was extremely easy.
dialog: CUT TO:
text: FLASHBACK of Gina putting a tracer on the back of Jake´s coat. It signals wherever he´s at.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: As I told you.
text: He goes back to typing at his computer. Gina makes a sound, clearing her throat. He looks up.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Yes?
dialog: GINA
dialog: Is that it? What about my reward?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Your reward is coming tonight, rest assured. It is something
dialog: Very unique.
dialog: GINA
dialog: I am glad to be of service.
text: She gets up and leaves. Lazlo watches after her and chuckles to himself.
dialog: EXT. NEW YORK CITY- DAY:
text: Jake and Ralph are on the run from some bounty hunters. Up above is a helicopter, way off in the distance. They go around a corner and into an alley. They stop at the end of the alley because of two bounty hunters.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Well, that´s no gonna work. What about the roof tops?
dialog: Jake gestures to the sky, shaking his head “no”.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Too many copters. They´d spot us in a minute.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Then, what?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: There.
text: He is pointing at a manhole cover. Ralph has a look on his face that tells us he doesn´t want to go down there.
dialog: Jake removes the manhole cover and they go down.
dialog: INT. SEWER SYSTEM
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Jeeez, this place stinks!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Smells like your room.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Hah hah, very funny (pause) Where are we going, anyway?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: We have to stay out of sight, they´re all looking for us.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: You´re not a regular ‘wolf. We could take on all of them!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: We? We? You need a reality check again. Me, I just want some peace.
text: They walk for a while—encountering some strange things along the way such as a human skeleton, rats, bats and when stepping over some water see an alligator. They eventually walk into what looks like a maintenance tunnel. There are lots of cobwebs. SOMETHING watches the two of them, though…
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Jake, look!
text: They look to the side and see glowing eyes staring at them and hear low growling noises. They are THE HIDDEN, those of who the moon has had a slightly different effect on. They are very dark in color, twisted features, a lot of teeth.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Shit—
dialog: A voice is heard—of THE LEADER, VINCENT
dialog: VINCENT
dialog: This is our domain. Why do you come here?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: We don´t have to answer to you. We´re werewolves!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: (to RALPH) Will you shut the fuck up!?!
dialog: VINCENT
dialog: Werewolves, hmmmm?
text: He comes partially out of the shadows, toward them, growling an eerie growl. And we see that he is also a werewolf, of sorts, stuck forever half between in the transformation. Half his face is that of a wolf, the other human. He also has one wolf paw instead of a hand. He is also HUGE.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: We mean you no harm!
text: VINCENT grabs Jake and throws him against the wall like a rag doll. Jack becomes angry and partially transforms—eerie yellow eyes, some hair, teeth, claws. VINCENT pauses at this, regarding him.
dialog: VINCENT
dialog: You can transform at will?
dialog: Jake shrugs.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: We´re just passing through, we don´t want any trouble.
dialog: VINCENT
dialog: Your being here is enough. We---don´t tolerate
dialog: Outsiders—
text: Then, another one of the deformed werewolves grab RALPH and pull him into the shadows. Ralph screams.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: No, I warned you, now I can´t be responsible for what
dialog: Happens!
dialog: He changes and attacks.
text: There is a brief fight in which Jake and Vincent go at it. Ralph takes a bit out of the creature holding him and it releases its hold on him. We see Jake and Vincent´s fight through a series of closeups and reaction shots of Ralph. Finally, Jake rips off Vincent´s good arm. He falls to the ground in pain while Jake stands over the body, growling triumphantly. The other mutants, having seen their leader beaten, back away into the shadows once more….
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Jake, Jake, snap out of it! We have to get out before
dialog: they decide to come back—
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Okay, Okay, let´s go…
dialog: VINCENT
dialog: Stop them! Agggghhh! (in pain) They can´t be allowed
dialog: to leave—they know our secret location! You are many, they
dialog: are only two! Kill them!
text: The mutants come back out of the shadows and go after Jake and Ralph. The two bolt through the tunnels. Finally they duck behind a wall. A rat runs by, squealing.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: A rat! Food!
dialog: He´s about to go for it but Jake grabs him and whispers.
dialog: JAKE (whispering)
dialog: We´re being chased by mutant freaks and you´re thinking
dialog: about food?!! Give me your lighter.
dialog: RALPH (also whispering)
dialog: You´re on my ass for looking at food and now you´re
dialog: gonna have a smoke?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Just give me the lighter, you idiot!
text: Jake grabs a piece of rag(s) on the floor and makes a ball and lights it up, throwing it in the direction of the approaching mutants. They can´t stand the flames and back up, making strange, fearful sounds.
dialog: Ralph looks around and sees a way out.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Jake! This way! Looks like a way out.
dialog: They both go in that direction but not before Jake throws another rag/flame ball at the mutants.
dialog: EXT. NEW YORK
dialog: They walk down a street.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Do you know where you´re going?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Not exactly, but we can´t go back home. The place
dialog: is crawling with cops. Maybe we should try and get
dialog: out of this fucking city. I just want to be left alone,
dialog: you know?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Whatever. But in the meantime maybe we should
dialog: Find a nice safe place to rest, you know—(he points)
dialog: like that warehouse, for example.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: You seem awfully anxious to go into that warehouse.
dialog: wouldn´t be because you want to find some rats, would
dialog: it?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: No, of course not! It´s just that I´m not going to be in
dialog: my right frame of mind tonight, I don´t feel so hot right now.
dialog: The full moon, you know?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Well, just don´t try humping my leg (pause). I really didn´t
dialog: expect you to come. It´s me the cops are after.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Hey, we´re pals, right? I´m here to back you up. I mean, what
dialog: are friends for, right?
text: Jake smiles and they both walk towards the warehouse. We hear their voices as they walk to the building in the distance.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: I don´t mind leaving this city anway. Me, I just want to
dialog: be able to watch a little tv, eat when I want, and howl at
dialog: the moon, you know?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: We should rest.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Best idea you had all day.
text: — EXT. NEW YORK CITY – DAY: A helicopter lands behind some buildings and several men loading a long, coffin sized crate into a van. They slam the doors to the van and drive off.
dialog: INT. BUILDING/WAREHOUSE:
dialog: JAKE and RALPH step into the abandoned warehouse.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Be careful, there might be traps—
dialog: RALPH
dialog: No one LIVES here—
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Exactly.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Well, it looks deserted. (he looks at Jake). Look,
dialog: you know you can rip the shit out of anyone if they
dialog: bother us.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Oh, I was just worrying about you.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Oh.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: SHOTS OF THE CITY—The sun is now setting.
dialog: INT. LAZLO´s BUILDING- basement.
text: The same men who unloaded the coffin sized crate from the van now bring it down the stairs into the basement of Lazlo´s building. They put it behind the bars of a cage that is built to one side of the room. Crosses and garlic dangle from the bars around the cage. They set it in the middle then leave, locking the door behind them.
text: Lazlo watches. Slowly, the lid of the crate moves and a hand comes out, a woman´s hand. Slowly, she pushes the top of it aside and sits up. She is young looking—and very very pissed. This is KESSA.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Welcome to my home. The accomodations are a little rustic, but
dialog: I´m sure you can understand why..
dialog: She glares at the crosses and the garlic.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Bat got your tongue, eh.
dialog: She hisses at him.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Don´t worry, though, you won´t be here long….
text: He turns and leaves. She watches him, hate in her eyes. She remembers—
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: KESSA FLASHBACK: Graphic “Two weeks ago”
dialog: INT. BUILDING:
text: Kessa feeds on a victim. She looks up, blood on her mouth. She realizes someone is watching her from the shadows.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: You the fuck are you and what do you want?
dialog: There is no reply.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: You´ve already pissed me off. Let´s not make it a slow and
dialog: agonizing death--
dialog: Still no reply.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Well…let´s.
text: A man steps out from the shadows, a crucifex in one hand, a stake in the other. She hisses at him.
dialog: He wears the collar of a priest.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Doing it the old fashioned way, I see. Fucking Van Helsing
dialog: wannabe.
dialog: Finally, the man speaks.
dialog: MAN
dialog: I do it with a little help from my friends….
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Fine. More food to play with.
text: One of them throws a stake—it goes through her arm. It surprises her. She tries to change shape but it´s not happening.
dialog: MAN
dialog: We put a blessing on the house—you can´t shift shape—
dialog: The men encircle her. She can´t stand the sight of the crosses.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: For cripes sake, just kill me—just get those good humor
dialog: Sticks out of my face!!!
dialog: MAN
dialog: We have no intention of killing you. It´s far more
dialog: Profitable to keep you “alive” as it were—
dialog: CUT TO: PRESENT
dialog: INT CAGE:
text: Kessa shakes her head of the memory and looks at the crosses on her cell bars.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Sold to the highest bidder. Blood is going to flow…
dialog: INT. BUILDING
text: JAKE and RALPH are sitting against a wall. We hear some squealing and Ralph slowly gets up, like a cat ready to pounce on a mouse. He darts out of frame. JAKE watches. When he comes back to sit back down he has a half eaten rat in one hand. Blood covers his mouth. He is clearly enjoying his snack.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: You´re disgusting.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Least I´m not hungry.
dialog: INT. LAZLO´s HOUSE- NIGHT
text: Laslo is pouring some wine into two glasses. He picks them up and hands one to his guest—GINA, who is dressed up. He raises his glass of wine in a toast—
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: To the beginning of a new world…
text: She clinks her glass against his and takes a sip.
dialog: GINA
dialog: So, where is this reward? Or is it something that is going to happen
dialog: Later on tonight…
dialog: She smiles at this, intention clear.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: You´ll be getting it alright. Well, no sense in beating around the bush. Do you…want to see it now?
dialog: Disappointment flickers for a moment on her face.
dialog: GINA
dialog: ` Sure--
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Follow me—
text: They go down into the basement—but Gina is feeling a bit woozy. She reaches out a hand to steady herself and Lazlo takes her arm.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Careful.—
text: When they get to the bottom the stairs they see the cage—and in it is KESSA, whose head is down. She looks very much like a victim. Gina´s face brightens up.
dialog: GINA
dialog: For me?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: All for you.
dialog: Gina steps forward, even more woozy. Perhaps we see a POV of her, all blurred, etc.
dialog: CUT TO:
text: GINA is now in the cage, Lazlo shuts the door behind her . She realizes what´s going on, but is drugged from the wine.
dialog: GINA
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: What I have to do.
text: KESSA looks up from her position and she is baring her fangs—GINA looks extremely surprised. KESSA feeds!
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Enjoy?
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Tasted like dog, to be honest. (pause)
dialog: You think you´re so smart, that you have it all figured out.
dialog: But soon my kind will come looking for me!
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: I don´t think so. This whole island is a prison that may be harder to break into than out of. Besides, we should be done
dialog: With my little experiment tomorrow night. You were stupid
dialog: To be captured…
dialog: She makes a face at him.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Let me go now and I may let you live.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Oooohhh.
text: He tosses the head at her but she movies aside. It bounces on the floor.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: You´re going to kill me?
dialog: He approaches her—looking as if he´s going to eat her.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Not tonight. Tonight, I just want a bite—
text: And he takes a bit out of her arm—her eyes widen and she realizes what has happened.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: What did you do to me?
dialog: Lazlo wipes blood off of the corner of his mouth.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: I´m making you one of us—
dialog: KESSA
dialog: It´s heresy!
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: It´s power. And it´s all going to be mine!
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: JAKE and RALPH
dialog: Jake is peeking out an old window.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Are they still out there?
dialog: We see Jake´s point of view—cops walking the streets, checking around.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: We mine as well try and get some sleep. They´ll be gone
dialog: When it´s dark.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Sounds great to me. Those hidious mutant freaks really
dialog: pooped me out.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Yeah, well one of us has to stay awake and keep watch…
dialog: Ralph takes out a coin.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Okay, we´ll flip and see who´s got the first watch.
dialog: He throws the coin –
dialog: RALPH
dialog: I got heads!
dialog: The coin lands on heads. Jake smiles.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Shit in a basket. (he glares at Jake) You suck.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Wake me up in a few hours.
dialog: Ralph walks to the window, Jake falls right to sleep…
dialog: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: JAKE´S NIGHTMARE (BLACK AND WHITE FLASHBACK).
text: Two men are walking through a forest and are attacked by two werewolves. They are JAKE and LAZLO in their wolf incarnations. They attack the men, who scream in terror. The two brothers feast on the bodies.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
text: It is morning and the two brothers wake up near what´s left of the bodies. Jake is repulsed and walks away—they speak in Italian
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Why do you walk away, brother?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: These things we do—they aren´t right. They are evil, things
dialog: Of the devil.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: These are the things we do—who we are!
dialog: They stop walking abruptly when they hear the sound of the mob approaching their home.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: Angry men, with torches in hand, approach Jake and Lazlo´s home.
dialog: CUT TO:
text: Jake and Lazlo run towards the sounds, leaping over bushes, past trees. Running and running.
dialog: CUT TO:
text: The angry men are lighting what looks like a molatov cocktail (glass bottle filled with gasoline), cursing in Italian.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: A photograph of Jake´s parents and sister falls on the floor. The glass frame breaks.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: The men shake their torches in anger.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: Jake and Lazlo are still running towards the house.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: House is in flames. Photos catch fire, girl´s doll on fire, perhaps burning person.
dialog: CUT TO:
text: Jake and Lazlo make it to the house and are crouched behind the bushes. But they are too late. The house is totally engulfed in flames. Jake looks to Lazlo, who doesn´t take his eyes off of the flames. Jake tries to approach his home but a dead body (one of his previous victims) rises from the ground and grabs his leg, tripping him, holding him there. The corpse speaks.
dialog: CORPSE
dialog: This is your fault, for all of your sins! Your killings!
dialog: Watch, watch them burn!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: No! No! NOOOOOOOOO!!!
dialog: INT. BUILDING- present
dialog: Jake wakes up screaming and scares the shit out of Ralph, who had started dozing off.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Yahhhhh! Shit. What the fuck is the matter with you?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Sorry…another one of my nightmares. How´s it lookin´
dialog: Out there?
dialog: Ralph looks out the window.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: I don´t´ see them anymore.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Let´s go—
dialog: EXT. CITY DAY—
text: A close up of a human skull is suddenly sprinkled upon by a fountain of water. We see that it is one of the bounty hunters, FRANK McCOY, relieving himself. His cellular phone starts ringing, but he has to wait until he´s done to answer it. The voice on the other end is LAZLO´s. We cut back and forth between the two of them as they talk.
dialog: FRANK
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: No one has taught you phone etiquette, have they? (pause)
dialog: FRANK
dialog: I said, “Yeah”.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: There´s a certain ‘wolf I´m interesting in.
dialog: FRANK
dialog: What´s so special about him? You´re no longer into young boys?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: If you weren´t so valuable to me I really wouldn´t put up with
dialog: This shit, you know…
dialog: FRANK
dialog: I am good, baby, oh yeah…
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: As I was saying, there´s a certain werewolf I´m interesting in
dialog: Capturing, alive, I might add.
dialog: FRANK
dialog: That´s way extra…
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Goes without saying. You´ll get triple your standard fee, if that´s agreeable.
dialog: FRANK
dialog: Hey, you know how to take care of me…
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Stay where you are an I´ll have a messenger send you over the
dialog: Equipment and information you´ll need.
dialog: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, I´ll be here. Have to rest for all the festivities tonight…
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Don´t have too much fun.
dialog: FRANK
dialog: Oh, not me.
dialog: Frank hangs up the phone just as another bounty hunter approaches him.
dialog: BOUNTY HUNTER #2
dialog: Who was that. Your mama?
dialog: FRANK
dialog: Actually, it was my retirement fund.
dialog: BOUNTY HUNTER #2
dialog: Whatever. If you´re hungry, they´re serving dinner
dialog: Back at the camp…
dialog: They turn and leave.
dialog: EXT. CITY-DAY
dialog: Jake and Ralph have made it to the outskirts of the city. There´s huge fences with barbed wire. Plus what look like bounty hunters.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Think we can take them?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Taking them is not the problem. It´s the fence I´m worried about. Looks like it´s charged with megavolts.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: So what, nothing can hurt you except silver bullets!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: How the fuck do you know? You´re so fucking tough, you go c limb it!
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Forget it. What now?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: With the full moon tonight this place is going to get wild. I say we make our way over to the park, rest up till we can plan an escape. We´ll come back in the morning, they won´t be expecting any trouble then, especially after the Moon.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: You´re the boss.
dialog: EXT. BOUNTY HUNTER CAMP—
text: Men grab guns and weapons out of racks, shots of feet running by, etc. Camera pans up to FRANK McCOY, who is looking at a small computer screen in his hand. It is the tracking device that Lazlo is tracking JAKE with.
dialog: FRANK
dialog: This is gonna be like shooting ducks in an arcade.
dialog: Bounty hunter #2 overhears him.
dialog: BOUNTY HUNTER #2
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: FRANK
dialog: Nothing to you, Mr. Snoop! Why the fuck are you
dialog: Always hanging around me?
dialog: BOUNTY HUNTER #2
dialog: Maybe because we´ve been hunting partners for the past
dialog: Four years? I don´t know.
dialog: FRANK
dialog: I…have to do something alone tonight.
dialog: BOUNTY HUNTER #2
dialog: You´re kidding, right? No one in their right mind
dialog: Goes out alone on a Full Moon.
dialog: FRANK
dialog: I´m not in my right mind. Go with Kerwin and the others.
dialog: They´ll protect you.
dialog: BOUNTY HUNTER #2
dialog: It wouldn´ve have anything to do with your “retirement
dialog: Fund” would it?
dialog: FRANK
dialog: I´d tell you, but if I tell you I´d have to kill you.
dialog: EXT. NEW YORK – NIGHT
text: FULL MOON is bright in the sky. Various shots of people doubling over in pain, growling, smashing things. They are all transforming into werewolves—thousands of werewolves.
dialog: INT.LAZLO´s BUILDING- NIGHT
dialog: Lazlo is standing before Kessa´s cage—she is starting to change into a werewolf as well—one with vampiric qualities (batlike ears, different fangs, etc, should be fairly unique looking)
dialog: KESSA
dialog: What have you done to me?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: I´ve made you better—
dialog: KESSA
dialog: You die!!!
dialog: Lazlo approaches the cage.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: You want a part of me?
dialog: All she can do is let out a growl.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Here—
text: He sticks his bare arm through the bars—and she attacks, sinking her snout into his forearm. There is little reaction on face—until he starts to change—
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: I….I can feel it!
dialog: He starts to change as well—
speaker_heading: CENTRAL PARK- NIGHT
text: Jake and Ralph have made it to the park. In the distance they hear the howls of the wolves. Ralph looks in that direction as if he wants to join them. He starts to do his mimic change routine. Unknown to them McCOY is nearby, watching them.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Arggghhh! I´m changing!
text: Jake watches him for a moment while he goes through his act, tearing at his shirt, etc.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Oh, why don´t you stop!
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Admit it, Jake, doesn´t it just make you want to join them.
dialog: You know, run with the pack?
text: Suddenly some werewolves emerge from their hiding place in the bushes and start to approach them. Jake quickly changes into his wolf persona. At that moment the bounty hunter lets loose with a hail of bullets, killing most of the werewolves. Ralph splits after Jake uses his body as a shield to protect him. Jake is angry at this and confronts the hunter.
dialog: McCOY
dialog: So, it´s really true, you can´t be hurt by regular bullets?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: You son of a bitch! You killed them in cold blood! They didn´t do anything! And for what, so you can sell their pelts to the highest bidder!?
dialog: McCOY
dialog: I suppose I´ll do that. But it´s you I´m really after (as he says this he pulls out another gun). I had these silver bullets made
dialog: Especially for you.
text: The bounty hunter starts firing silver bullets. Jake jumps and rolls on the grass behind some bushes.
dialog: McCOY
dialog: They say only a shot in the heart can kill you but I´m betting that if I hit you anywhere it´s gonna hurt like a mother fucker. Care to test my theory?
text: He starts firing into the bushes Jake has disappeared into. He hears JAKE yell and smiles. He goes to claim his prize.
text: Suddenly, Jake jumps down from a tree and grabs the hunter, shoving him into a tree.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Dog Food!
dialog: McCOY
dialog: Take it easy, take it easy. I wasn´t really gonna kill ya, honest.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Oh, really. Why should I believe you?
dialog: McCOY
dialog: Because my employer wants you back alive. He gave me the whole low down on you, how you could be stopped and…
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Who!?!?!?!
dialog: McCOY
dialog: I don´t know…honest! I never saw him in person.
text: He reaches into his pocket and takes out a gold medallion, which Jake immediately recognizes. It has a picture of a pentagram on it.
dialog: McCOY
dialog: He wanted me to show you this…said it belonged to you…
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Lazlo!
dialog: McCOY
dialog: Who?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Shut up! I wasn´t talking to you! I´ll take that gun of yours.
dialog: And this rope you have too.
dialog: Jake then ties him to a tree and throws the rest of the weapons away.
dialog: McCOY
dialog: Look, I wasn´t gonna kill you—just deliver you to him, like
dialog: he wanted.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Well, he´s damn right about that. I want nothing to do with
dialog: him.
dialog: McCOY
dialog: Well, I think you probably should—he has your friend
dialog: by now—
dialog: JAKE looks around—calls out.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Ralph?
dialog: McCOY
dialog: He´s caught.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Like you—
dialog: JAKE growls at him, ferocious.
dialog: McCOY W..What are you gonna do to me?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Me? Nothing. But they don´t look too happy with you.
dialog: Jake looks to the side and we see hungry werewolves approaching, growling.
dialog: McCOY
dialog: No, please, don´t leave me tied up here! Without my weapons
dialog: They´ll kill me!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Like you killed those poor souls before. You scavengers seem
dialog: To forget that we were human once, just like you. Your own kind! You´re worse than an animal. They kill because of the
dialog: Genes in their bodies. You kill only for sport and greed!
text: Jake turns and leaves but not before taking the bounty hunter´s duffel bag with him. These weapons will come in handy later on…
dialog: McCOY
dialog: No! Wait! Please!!
text: The werewolves approach the tied up hunter and he screams as they tear into him as we tilt up to the FULL MOON. He screams.
dialog: CUT TO:
text: Morning. The sun has made its way on the horizon. City looks deserted. Ralph wakes up from where he´s sprawled out on the park bench. He spits out a bone he had in his mouth. He gets up and starts walking. He goes to the nearest telephone and makes a call.
dialog: RALPH
dialog: Yeah, it´s me. (pause). I did what you said. (pause)
dialog: I need a place to stay—I just don´t want any of your
dialog: Thugs beating the shit out of me when I come knocking…
dialog: He hangs up the phone a moment later and walks on…
dialog: INT. LAZLO´s APT.
dialog: RALPH is in the midst of talking…
dialog: RALPH
dialog: He´s coming for you, Lazlo. He knows you´re behind
dialog: The setup. I´ve done everything you asked so far—killed the
dialog: Norm outside the apartment, even planted Jake´s shjrt on
dialog: Him as incriminating evidence. Now it´s your turn—make me
dialog: Into a real werewolf! I promise to serve you loyally!
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Fool. If you´d betray your best friend whose to say you
dialog: Would not betray me one day?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: No, never! I would never betray you! Please make me a real
dialog: Wolf and will serve only you!
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Spineless dog shit. Did you honestly think I´d really transform
dialog: YOU into one of the better species?
dialog: RALPH
dialog: You promised! We had a bargain.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Yes, I promised I would change you and so I shall.
dialog: In a few moments you´ll be dead. That´s a change from
dialog: Being alive, isn´t it? Ha ha ha ha ha!!!!
dialog: He lunges at RALPH and kills him horribly, There´s lots of guts and bone breaking.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: EXT. CENTRAL PARK—
dialog: Jake is walking around, looking for his friend. He calls out—
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Ralph! Ralph!
dialog: There is no reply. He continues on.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Damnit.
dialog: EXT. CITY-
text: Jake is walking out of Central Park, no one around except a bum who has a sign near him that reads “WILL WORK FOR HUMAN FLESH”. Otherwise, the streets are empty. He looks up at the Gargoyles on buildings. Everything he sees seems to disgust him about the city—it´s written on his face.
dialog: EXT. NEW YORK CITY—
dialog: Various shots of Jake walking in New York, thinking to himself. We get the sense that time is passing.
text: He finally stops and pulls out a chain with a figure of Christ on a cross dangling from it. The CAMERA ZOOMS in on it—
dialog: JAKE (V0) What the hell does my brother want? All´s
dialog: I want is to get out of this city, is that too much
dialog: To ask? What the fuck does he want?
dialog: CUT TO: FLASHBACK (Black and White)
text: JAKE is sitting on a park bench, looking at the same cross. Lazlo comes up from behind him.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Praying to that God of yours again? Do you think he´s
dialog: going to cure you?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Probably not.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Mother should never have given you that. It´s false hope,
dialog: pathetic faith.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Maybe faith is all we have now…
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: You´re confused, Jake. My guidance is what you need
dialog: now. You´ve only begun to see the cruelty of man, the selfishness, the insolence.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Yes, they can be evil at times but there IS good in
dialog: them. I can sense it.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: You still want to be one of them, don´t you?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: And what´s so wrong with wanting to be a normal human
dialog: being? Our mother and sister were normal and they were
dialog: good people!
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: They were weak! That´s why they weren´t given the gift!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: The Gift? You call these powers a gift? To hunt and kill
dialog: like an animal? It´s more like a curse, a curse our father
dialog: knew only too well.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Our father was a great man! Kyou should thank that God
dialog: of yours for giving you the power we possess! You don´t
dialog: deserve it!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Listen to me Lazlo. We must work together, seek out doctors
dialog: and find a cure, not jut for us but for the others!
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: You´re a fool! You always were. I don´t want a cure! I want to embrace it, to lead the others who are like us! I want to crush the humans to the ground until only our kind remains.
dialog: With that declaration he storms away, into the park.
dialog: CUT TO: PRESENT
dialog: EXT. CITY
dialog: JAKE Finally, he throws up his hands, coming to a decision.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Better to get it over with.
dialog: EXT. LAZLO´S BUILDING:
text: He finally makes his way to Lazlo´s building. He kicks the recently killed body out of the doorway and continues on…
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Come out, Laz. I know you´re there.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: So, you´ve come to join me at last, eh brother?
dialog: And why not, we´re still family, aren´t we?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Cut the shit. Did you think I wouldn´t figure out it was you who set me up?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: I was hoping you would. What better way to get you here.
dialog: I want you here at my side, to rule these pathetic weak humans who think they can hold US prisoner! It´s our destiny! We
dialog: Are strong!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: You´re babbling, like a broken record.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: You, of all people, should understand how I feel—or did you forget what they did to our parents. To our sister?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I feel the rage, too,but that´s not the way. What we did back at our village was wrong, evil, but now we can control it! We can help by setting an example to those who suffer from the disease.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Do you polish your halo everyday?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: This is insanity. Even if I wanted to help you, which I don´t,
dialog: How do you plan on taking on all of the Norms? They outnumber us a thousand to one!
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Poor Jake. You never did have much of an imagination.
dialog: What happened to you? You were always the one that held the
dialog: Faith, always searching for that wonder cure that would make you “normal”. Common. Are you still ashamed of your heritage?
dialog: He lowers his head in shame. He doesn´t need to answer.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: That´s a shame. Perhaps once you see what I´ve accomplished
dialog: for our kind you´ll think differently. Come on, I have something to show you.
text: Jake reluctantly follows Lazlo down a dark corridor and down some stairs. The place is spooky looking, with cobwebs and maybe some spiders around. There are a few body parts also lying about.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Do excuse the mess. It´s just so hard to find good help
dialog: these days.
dialog: He smiles an evil smile, turns and walks away.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Look, just show me where Ralph is—that bounty
dialog: hunter said you had him.
dialog: Lazlo doesn´t answer. Jake follows…
text: The two walk until they come to a room with a jail cell in it. The crosses and bulbs of garlic hang from the bars. This is where KESSA has been kept. She looks very drained and sad. Jake sniffs the air in front of him.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: A vampire? You´ve captured a vampire?
text: Lazlo ignores Jake. Instead, he rattles the cell bars with a nearby stick.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Wake up my dear, wake up. We have a special guest.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Fuck off dog breath!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I always thought you were just a LITTLE nuts. Don´t you
dialog: realize that her kind will come looking for her?
dialog: KESSA
dialog: That´s what I keep telling him but he´s a little thick.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Silence! (to JAKE) Now, dear brother, it´s common knowledge that the vampire legion left this city years ago, right around the time the meteorite collision with the moon,
dialog: which brought forth more of OUR kind. (PAUSE) I had this
dialog: one shipped in especially for my experiment, which I must say has shown very pleasing results.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: (to JAKE) He plans on killing me. You know, to show what a big WOLF man he is and all….
dialog: JAKE
dialog: (to Lazlo) You should really let her go—vampires are not
dialog: good to mess with—
dialog: KESSA
dialog: That´s right. We´re gonna suck the blood out of your hides!
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I´m not going to go along with this, you know. I´m a lot
dialog: Older now, Laz. A lot has changed since we were kids.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: (whispering to himself)
dialog: Yes, a lot of things have changed.
text: At this point Lazlo triggers his own transformation, into that of a monstrous hybrid of vampire and werewolf. The change is dramatic, the most dramatic transformation we have seen yet. He smiles, evilly, as he growls, getting into the pain of the change. His eyes turn yellow, his clothes rip as fur appears across his forearms. His teeth grow extra long, saliva pouring out his gaping mouth. His ears grow long and pointy.
dialog: While this is going on KESSA gets Jake´s attention.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Get me out of here now and I promise you´ll be spared.
text: He turns from her to his brother, who is midway changed. When he turns back to her her demeanor is more helpless and tone more pleading.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Please, don´t let him kill me—
text: Jake makes his decision. He tears away the religious artifacts from the cell bars and starts to bend them. But before he can finish creating a hole big enough for the vampire to fit through Lazlo has now fully transformed into the creature. And attacks him…
text: The were/bat lunges at Jake and they take down a door and end up in the next room. As they fall and roll, the bounty hunter´s duffel bag rips off of Jake. The fight continues…
dialog: Lazlo bites JAKE just as he starts to transform into his wolf form.
text: JAKE rolls on the floor in great pain as the vampire blood mixes with his own, transforming him into a similar looking creature to Lazlo. He is brownish in color, though, while Lazlo is black/blue. Jake stares at his brother´s yellow eyes, communicating a question which we hear. As brothers, they can speak to each other´s minds when in wolf form. Audible over their growls is what they are saying to each other….
dialog: JAKE (VO)
dialog: My god, what have you done to me?
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: I´ve given you the gift of immortality. In short, I´ve turned you
dialog: Into a better creature such as myself. You should be grateful.
text: JAKE looks away for a moment, staring at his hand, which is now webbed. He stares back at Lazlo.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Grateful? Grateful? You´ve made it worse!!!
dialog: JAKE lunges at his brother, renewing the battle.
text: While they fight, Kessa has managed to get out of her cell. She spots the duffel bag dropped by JAKE and picks it up. She too is starting to transform but not as severe as the brothers. She now has fangs and some fur on her face and claws.
dialog: JAKE has now jumped on Lazlo´s back.
dialog: JAKE (VO)
dialog: Forgive me, brother…
text: And with a weird, savage growl that is a mixture of wolf and bat, Jake rips off his brother´s head. There is a lot of blood shooting out and the head rolls to the end of the room, bouncing off the wall. Lazlo´s headless body tears Jake off and tosses him to the side of the room, where he lands on all fours and growls like a savage animal. It´s here that JAKE sees the mangled body of RALPH on the ground. He is shocked—but not as shocked as he is to see the decapitated head of Lazlo (now human) staring up at him and talking. Meanwhile, Lazlo´s headless body, still wolflike, is slowly picking itself up off the floor.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: Don´t look so sad, Jake. He deserved to die for double-crossing
dialog: You. He´s the one who really set you up.
dialog: JAKE can´t take his eyes off the impossibility before him.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: You look surprised. Did you really think that would kill me?
dialog: Lazlo starts laughing.
text: Kessa enters the room, holding the bounty hunter duffel bag. And his gun. The one with the silver bullets. She fires at the headless body several times. The impact of the bullets push the body back but it does not kill it. Strangely, the head of Lazlo winces with slight pain with each bullet shot.
text: The body turns around to “face” her. This gives JAKE enough time to get to his feet. KESSA looks at the Lazlo creature,then at JAKE—and gestures with her head that he should do something. She fires more bullets and this time Lazlo´s head makes a sound. This gives JAKE an idea.
text: He reaches over and grabs Lazlo´s head—and runs into the other room with it, where the jail cell is.
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: What are you doing?
text: In the other room the Lazlo body is fumbling around without eyesight to direct it. It is blind. Kessa steps around it and kicks it in the ass as he darts into the other room after JAKE.
dialog: JAKE has now returned more to his human form, though he still has werewolf teeth and eyes.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: What should I do?
dialog: KESSA
dialog: We have to separate his head from his body permanently, so he
dialog: Can´t reform.—here—
dialog: She takes the head from Jake´s grasp and throws the screaming head into her coffin.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Now what?
dialog: KESSA
dialog: We have to fill the coffin with garlic and other religious artifacts—
dialog: The stuf f on the floor—
text: Jake places reaches into his shirt and reveals the cross and chain given to him by his mother—we see it has burned a mark into his chest. He then rips it off and places it into the box with Lazlo´s head. It makes Jake´s hand smoke and is in pain, confused. A sideeffect of Lazlo´s “gift”. Kessa flips the lid over as Lazlo screams out—
dialog: LAZLO
dialog: No, don´t. Don´t!!!! Noooo!!!!!
dialog: Kessa pulls Jake aside.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Okay, let´s go.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Wait, we´re not done. He might come after us—
dialog: KESSA
dialog: I doubt it—
dialog: She starts pulling him back towards the stairs.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: We really have to go--
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Why, what did you do?
text: To answer this we cut to the bomb stuffed in the Lazlo werewolf´s body´s pants. We see the numbers clicking by. A countdown. It is feeling against the wall for the entrace to the jail cell room, trying to find them. But without Lazlo´s line of sight it is hard.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: You´ll see—
text: They scramble up the stairs—but a hand grabs her leg. She kicks it off and they continue up to outside—they run out and pause a distance away.
dialog: INT. BASEMENT
text: By now the werewolf body has found the head and takes it out of the box—placing it back on its shoulders. This is when Lazlo feels—and then sees-- the grenade stuffed in his pants. He explodes.
dialog: EXT. HOUSE—
dialog: There is the sound of an explosion and some flames.
text: Both Kessa and Jake stand and watch for a moment, before they continue. The sounds of approaching crowd—Lazlo´s followers—is heard.
dialog: EXT. CITY—
dialog: They are running down the street—Kessa pulls on his arm. They stop.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: What is it?
dialog: She is pointing at the horizon.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Look—
dialog: The sun is starting to rise.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: What?
dialog: She makes a sound and gesure with her hands, as if something explodes.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Oh. You think?
dialog: She nods a yes.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Shit. Let´s go.
dialog: They both continue…
text: Jake and Kessa duck into a nearby building –and see that it is to the staircase that goes up. He looks at her and she shrugs. The sounds of the crowd is still behind them.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Up we go.
text: He walks past her and starts up the stairs. She follows, a bit reluctantly.
text: On the way up they try getting in through the doors but they are all locked. They continue up.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: There must be an open floor up here—
dialog: They continue…sounds still behind them…
text: Finally they get to the top—and can see the sunlight leaking in through the bottom of the doorway that leads to the roof. Jake peers over the stairs and can see them coming—
dialog: He quickly takes Kessa´s arm, opens the door and pulls them through.
dialog: For a moment they´re both blinded by the light. But nothing happens.
text: They stand before the closed door, incredulous. Kessa examines her hands. No spontaneous combustion.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: I can´t believe it. The sun is up and I´m not frying.
dialog: I haven´t seen daylight in six hundred years…
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Must be one of the good side effects of Lazlo´s experiment.
dialog: Maybe something good came out of this for you after all.
dialog: She stares at him….
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Why did you save me back there—when your brother was
dialog: going to kill me?
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I…don´t know. I guess I have this annoying habit of helping
dialog: people who need it. (PAUSE). Why didn´t you split after we
dialog: killed him?
dialog: KESSA
dialog: I figured I´d return the favor.
text: There is loud banging on the door, but it holds. They hear the angry mob of Lazlo´s former followers. The door won´t hold for long.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: We´re trapped.
text: Kessa walks to the edge of the building and looks down. At least ten stories above the street.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Maybe not—there IS another way out.
dialog: He stands beside her and looks down below, shaking his head.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: Don´t you think if I could have done that years ago I would have?
dialog: No, it´s part of the curse.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: No, you just need to take a step and the rest will happen—
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I told you—
dialog: KESSA
dialog: I think we can still fly.
dialog: His eyes light up.
dialog: CUT TO:
text: The crowd has manage to get the door open. But when they step on the roof they see that Kessa and Jake are nowhere to be seen.
dialog: ANGRY MAN
dialog: Where did they go?
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: EXT. NEW JERSEY—
dialog: A skyline shot of New York City widens out to show Jake and Kessa standing side by side.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: I never thought I´d be able to leave that place…life´s
dialog: a funny thing.
dialog: She nods in agreement and walks out of frame.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: What now?
dialog: KESSA
dialog: Anything. Everything.
dialog: JAKE
dialog: What do you want to do first?.
dialog: KESSA
dialog: How about getting to know each other better?
dialog: She gestures for him to come to her. Intention is clear.
dialog: Jake smiles and lets out a wolfish “howl” as goes to her.
