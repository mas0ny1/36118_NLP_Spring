scene_heading: INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - NIGHT
text: Darkness. Silence. After a long beat, we hear movement,
text: confined and contained.
text: We then hear the sound of a man, PAUL CONROY, groaning,
text: making confused attempts at words. We hear his movement;
text: short, abrupt shifting, ending almost immediately with the
text: sound of his body banging against wood.
text: He screams, though it's clear from the sound that his mouth
text: is covered by something.
text: After attempting to sit up, he immediately bangs his head
text: against something. It's terribly warm and his breaths are
text: labored.
text: He attempts to move to his left and right, only to find that
text: he is confined on those sides, as well. He frantically
text: shifts about, only to discover, by touch, that he is encased
dialog: in something.
text: Something is very wrong, and he doesn't need to see to know
dialog: that.
text: Finally, we see him, lit by the flame of the Zippo he holds
text: in his hands, which are bound together in front of him with
text: rope. A rolled-up, dirty rag is tied tightly around his
text: head, stretched across his mouth. Dried blood stains his
text: hair and forehead.
dialog: 
text: We see that he is lying in an old fashioned, wooden coffin.
text: Nothing more than a few rotted-out planks of wood nailed
text: together. Realizing the same, Paul is struck by an
text: overwhelming, instant panic.
text: With great difficulty, and while still holding the lit Zippo,
text: Paul removes the muzzle from his mouth.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What...? What is this?
text: His words become almost unintelligible as he flails about,
text: though fear is understood in his every utterance.
text: He screams aloud, but his voice is captured by the coffin
dialog: walls.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh my God! Help me!! Help me!!
text: He kicks and slams his hands against the top and sides of the
text: coffin, all to no avail. His violent movements cause small
text: grains of sand to trickle in through the space between the
text: sides and top of the coffin, as well as a small gap that
text: exists between one of the coffin's broken wooden planks.
text: Sweat cascades down the side of his neck, dripping from his
text: dampened brow. The heat inside the extremely close confines
text: of the coffin is stifling.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Somebody help me! Please!!
text: Paul continues with his futile efforts to pry off the top of
text: the coffin. The sides, the top, the bottom -- all are too
text: thoroughly reinforced by the force of what surrounds the
text: coffin. Sand. It becomes clear to him that he is buried.
text: He tries his best to calm himself, though he has trouble
text: catching his breath. It takes him some time, but he
text: eventually achieves some semblance of calm.
text: Getting a good look at him for the first time, we see that
text: Paul is somewhere around 37 years old. Unshaven and
text: physically unremarkable, he embodies the blue-collar American
dialog: everyman.
text: He coughs. The minimal amount of oxygen in the coffin makes
text: it hard for him to breathe.
text: His eyes widen a bit upon seeing an exposed, rusty nail. He
text: tries desperately to use the nail to cut through the old,
text: frayed ropes that bind his hands. Doing so is no easy task.
text: The incredibly tight quarters makes his every action nearly
dialog: impossible.
text: After a lengthy struggle, the rope snaps. Paul quickly frees
text: his hands. A small victory. Very small.
text: The heat is unbearable. Paul takes off his button-down
text: shirt, leaving him in a T-shirt. His body battles against
text: the walls and the ceiling of the coffin with every move he
dialog: makes.
text: He tosses his button-down shirt down by his feet. His
text: undershirt is drenched through with sweat.
text: Still trying to calm himself, but having little success in
text: doing so, Paul looks around the coffin. His feet, though
text: only his body-length away, seem miles from him.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He looks at the top of the coffin, and then back at his feet.
text: With great difficulty, he shifts his body so that his feet
text: are pressed against the top of the coffin. He attempts to
text: use his leg strength to push the top off of him, but it
text: doesn't move even a millimeter.
text: After several failed attempts, and with his legs exhausted,
text: Paul drops his feet from the top of the coffin. He lay for a
text: moment in silence, followed by an outburst of crying.
text: Close to his head, on the corner of the floor, we see there's
text: another broken plank. A small hole.
text: He closes his cigarette lighter, extinguishing the flame. In
text: total darkness, he continues to cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: What is this?
text: With his sobbing slowly subsiding, the coffin soon grows
text: eerily silent.
text: The sound of Paul's labored breaths are all we hear, softened
text: under the blanket of absolute darkness.
text: After a beat, the silence is interrupted by a subtle buzzing
text: sound. The muted sight of strange, blueish light flickers in
text: the coffin, by Paul's feet. He is extremely startled.
text: The buzzing continues, as does the minimal splashing of
text: light. It's coming from underneath his discarded button-down
text: shirt, down near his feet.
text: He lights the Zippo to get a better look.
dialog: 
text: Pulling the shirt away, he realizes that what he is hearing
text: and seeing is the vibrating ring and display features of an
text: older model cell phone.
text: He frantically reaches for it, though the coffin is far too
text: small for him to reposition himself so easily.
text: To his dismay, the phone stops ringing. But, his efforts to
text: reach it continue. He uses his feet to search for the phone.
text: After some trouble finding it, he eventually locates it.
text: Clamping the phone together between his clasped feet, Paul
text: then painfully angles his body so that he can reach his feet
text: with his hands and grab it.
text: He is soon able to reach it. Immediately thereafter, he
text: flips open the phone and puts the receiver in front of him.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: We see that there is a Text Message waiting for Paul on the
text: phone. However, Paul barely notices.
text: The time on the phone reads 6:12pm. While the numbers and
text: display screen icons are familiar to Americans, all the words
dialog: are in Arabic.
text: What he does notices is that the phone barely has one bar of
text: signal strength. Worse yet, there is only half of the
dialog: battery life remaining.
text: He tries to remember the Safe Number he was given. With the
text: phone open and ready to be dialed, Paul struggles to recall
dialog: the information.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, come on. What was it?
dialog: 
text: Getting only two digits into dialing the number, he cannot
text: remember much more and closes the phone.
text: He wedges the lit Zippo into sand, which is compacted against
text: a small hole in the wall of the coffin.
text: Paul reaches into his pants pocket, frantically searching for
text: something. He hastily removes a prescription pill bottle and
text: a small, metal flask. Both are not what he was looking for.
text: He then reaches to his back pocket and removes his wallet.
text: It's empty. His license, his credit cards, his cash and,
text: most importantly at that very moment, a piece of paper with
text: the Safe Number written on it, are all missing.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: No. Where the hell is it? Son of
dialog: a...Come on!
dialog: 
text: He screams aloud again, hoping greatly that someone can hear
text: him. His frenzied maneuvering puts out the flame of the
dialog: Zippo.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Help me! Please! Somebody help
dialog: me!
text: His words barely make it pass the coffin walls.
text: With the cell phone still in hand, and laboring to reclaim
text: the breath he just expended, Paul turns to desperation. He
text: dials the international code of 001, and then dials 911.
text: A FEMALE 911 OPERATOR answers almost immediately.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: 911, please hold.
text: The Female 911 Operator places Paul on hold.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No! Wait!
text: Paul accidentally bangs the cap of the Zippo against the
text: coffin wall, putting out the flame.
text: She quickly returns.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: 911. What is your emergency?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: 911. What's the problem, sir?
text: Paul is so incredibly panicked that he has trouble remaining
text: coherent. After a few sparks, the Zippo is re-lit.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm buried. You have to help me.
dialog: You have to help me, I can't
dialog: breathe...
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
speaker_heading: SIR --
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm buried in a coffin. Please
dialog: help me! Send someone to find
dialog: me...
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: Sir...slow down. What is your
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Paul. Paul Conroy.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: Okay, Mister Conroy. Can you tell
dialog: me your location?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: I don't know. I'm in a coffin. I
dialog: don't know where. I'm scared.
dialog: Please help me.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: You're in a coffin?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah, it's, like, one of those old,
dialog: wooden ones.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: Are you at a funeral home?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. I don't know. No.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: How are calling me right now?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What?
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: If you're buried in a coffin, where
dialog: are you calling from?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: A cell phone. There was an old
text: cell phone in the coffin.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: You're calling from your cell
dialog: phone?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. No. It's not mine, but yes,
text: I'm calling from a cell phone.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
text: There was a cell phone in the
dialog: coffin when you climbed in?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I didn't climb in.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: How did you end up in the coffin,
dialog: sir?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I was put here.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: In the coffin?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. Please send help.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: And you're saying the coffin is
dialog: buried?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I think so. It's...it's hot in
dialog: here. I can't breathe.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: Do you know your location, sir?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I told you, I don't know.
text: Somewhere in Iraq.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: Iraq?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. I'm a truck driver, an
dialog: American. I work for CRT.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: Are you a soldier, sir?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. Please, please listen to me.
dialog: I'm a truck driver. I work for
dialog: CRT. I'm a civilian contractor
dialog: working in Iraq. We were attacked
dialog: in Baqubah, they...they...
speaker_heading: (STARTS CRYING)
dialog: ...shot them. All of them.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: They shot who, sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: All of the other drivers.
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: And you're saying this happened in
dialog: Iraq? The country?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. Please, you have to help me.
dialog: They gave me a safety number to
dialog: call, but I had it stored in my
dialog: wallet and --
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: Mister Conroy, this is 911
dialog: emergency in Youngstown, Ohio.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ohio?
scene_heading: FEMALE 911 OPERATOR
dialog: Yes, sir. I'm not sure exactly how
dialog: you called here if you're in
dialog: another country, but if you'd like,
dialog: I can patch you through to the
dialog: Sheriff's Department.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sheriff's Department? No...you
dialog: don't underst...
speaker_heading: (GIVING UP)
dialog: ...forget it.
text: Realizing that his conversation is both lengthy and useless,
text: Paul ends the call. He checks the battery life on the phone.
text: It still holds steady at two bars.
text: He immediately dials another number, one that he can recall
text: with ease.
text: He again enters the 001 international code before making the
dialog: call.
text: Paul then dials his home phone. It rings several times, so
text: far unanswered.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Come on, come on. Pick up.
dialog: Please.
text: After sitting through the agony of a few more rings, Paul is
text: met with the answering machine.
dialog: 
text: The voice of his young son, SHANE, is heard on the answering
text: machine greeting.
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Thanks for calling the Conroy's.
dialog: We're not home right now. Please
text: leave a message at the beep.
dialog: Thanks.
text: At the sound of the Beep, Paul leaves a frenzied, rambling
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Linda, honey, it's me. Listen, I
dialog: need you to contact the National
text: Guard right away. Or the Pentagon.
dialog: Tell them we were attacked in the
dialog: Diyala Provence, in Baqubah.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: They have to find me. Please help
dialog: me, baby. Please help them find me.
text: Paul hangs up. He dials his wife's cell phone right away.
text: After several rings, her cell phone voice mail picks up. We
text: hear the sound of Linda, Paul's wife, on her outgoing
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a
dialog: message. Thanks and have a great
dialog: day.
text: The Beep sounds and Paul immediately tears into his voice
dialog: message.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Linda, it's Paul. I need you to
dialog: call me right away. This is an
dialog: absolute emergency. Call the
dialog: number that comes up on your phone.
dialog: Call me at that number. If I don't
dialog: answer, call the Pentagon or the
dialog: F.B.I. I don't know what the hell
text: is going on, but I'm buried in a
dialog: box...
text: Hearing himself say those last words gives him pause. The
text: gravity of the situation fully takes hold.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I can't breathe in here. Make
dialog: sure you call me right away.
dialog: Please, baby, please call me.
dialog: 
text: Paul ends the call. He nervously looks at the amount of
text: battery life remaining on the phone. Still holding strong at
dialog: two bars.
text: He notices the flickering light of the Zippo. It, too,
text: appears to be using up small amounts of oxygen. He closes
text: the lid, extinguishing the flame.
text: Total darkness. Silence, save for Paul's increasingly heavy
dialog: breaths.
text: He begins to hyperventilate. He knows that preserving oxygen
text: is paramount, so he does his best to calm himself. The
text: healthy swig he takes from his flask helps.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He flips open the cell phone. The light of the display
text: screen partially illuminates his face and some of the coffin
text: with a blueish hue. Paul again enters the overseas dialing
text: code, this time dialing 411 information.
text: The 411 OPERATOR answers.
speaker_heading: 411 OPERATOR
dialog: What city and state, please?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Um...I don't know. The F.B.I.,
dialog: wherever they are.
text: Paul reaches for his button-down shirt. Fishes for pens
text: stashed in his lapel pocket, while keeping the phone pressed
text: to his ear with his shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 411 OPERATOR
dialog: Do you have a specific city you'd
dialog: like to be connected to, sir?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't care, any city. Just
dialog: connect me to the F.B.I.
speaker_heading: 411 OPERATOR
dialog: Sir, I have F.B.I. field offices
dialog: listed in Boston, New York,
dialog: Philadelphia, New Haven, Los
dialog: Angeles, Chicago, Denver --
text: Paul cannot bear to listen any further to this list that
text: seemingly never ends.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anywhere! Any city, just connect
dialog: me, please!
speaker_heading: 411 OPERATOR
dialog: I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not allowed
dialog: to do that.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Fine, um...Chicago. Okay?
speaker_heading: 411 OPERATOR
dialog: Please hold for your number.
text: Paul is transferred to an AUTOMATED MESSAGE.
scene_heading: AUTOMATED MESSAGE
dialog: The number you requested, 312-421-
dialog: 6700...
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Paul writes the digits of the phone number on the top of the
text: coffin with his pen. But, after the first three numbers, the
text: pen stops working. He hurriedly reaches back into his shirt
text: pocket to remove the other pen, which is actually a click-up
text: pencil. Click-click-click-click. He writes the last seven
text: digits, followed by the word "FBI."
speaker_heading: AUTOMATED MESSAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...can be connected for an
dialog: additional charge of twenty-five
dialog: cents by pressing the number one.
text: He presses the number one and is connected directly.
text: After a few rings, SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS answers.
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: Chicago field office. Special
dialog: Agent Harris.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hello? Is this the F.B.I.?
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: Yes it is, sir.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm calling from Iraq. I'm buried
dialog: in the desert somewhere. I need
dialog: you to help me --
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: Whoa, whoa, sir. Slow down. When
dialog: were you in Iraq?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Now. I'm there now. I'm a truck
dialog: driver for CRT. I've been here for
dialog: nine months.
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: May I have your name please, sir?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Paul Conroy.
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
text: (saying it as he writes it
speaker_heading: DOWN)
dialog: Paul Conroy.
dialog: (back on the phone)
dialog: Okay, Paul, explain to me what's
text: going on.
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Paul attempts to center himself so that he can accurately
text: tell his story.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Alright. Me and a convoy of other
dialog: drivers were delivering kitchen
dialog: parts to a community center. As we
text: got closer, a bunch of kids started
text: throwing rocks at our trucks. Then
text: an IED went off up ahead and blew
text: up one of the other trucks. These
text: guys came out from behind the
text: houses with guns and started
dialog: shooting everybody right there on
dialog: the street.
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: Were you shot at?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't know!
dialog: (after a breath, calmer)
dialog: I don't know. I was way in the
dialog: back of the convoy. I must have got
text: hit in the head with one of the
dialog: rocks and got knocked out. That's
dialog: the last thing I remember. But now
dialog: I just woke up, and I was tied up
text: and buried in a coffin.
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: Who put you there?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I guess whoever ambushed us.
dialog: 
text: Special Agent Harris sounds slightly skeptical of Paul's
dialog: claims.
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: A bunch of kids?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, you're not listening. The kids
text: threw the rocks at us, but then
dialog: some Iraqi guys -- maybe
dialog: insurgents, I don't fucking know --
text: popped out of nowhere and started
text: shooting at us.
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: I thought you said they didn't
dialog: shoot at you.
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: They didn't, I don't know! But
dialog: they shot them!
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: Sir, you're going to have to stop
dialog: shouting if --
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm shouting because you're not
dialog: listening! I need you to help me!
dialog: Please!!
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: Hmmm...
text: Paul takes a moment to center himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Can you trace my call? GPS or
dialog: something?
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: Why is it that they didn't shoot
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I have no idea. They didn't,
dialog: that's all I know.
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: What's your social security number,
dialog: Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why? Who cares? I'm buried in the
dialog: middle of the fucking desert! Who
dialog: cares what my social security
dialog: number is?! I'm an American
dialog: citizen. Just send someone to find
dialog: me!
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: Do you know where you're
dialog: ...lo...if...dy..
text: The cell phone starts breaking up.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hello? What? I can't hear you.
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT HARRIS
dialog: Bet...un...near...
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Special Agent Harris is not heard at all.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hello?! Hello?!
text: Paul checks the phone's display, where he sees that the call
dialog: has been lost.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit!!
text: Cell phone service temporarily goes down. Paul lights the
text: Zippo to help him see the cell phone screen. He tries to
text: make a call, but nothing happens.
text: He shakes the phone, moves it around the coffin, all in
text: desperate hope that he will get a signal. He soon does.
dialog: 
text: He looks at the number for the F.B.I. that he has written on
text: the wall, thinking about calling them back. He then checks
text: the battery life on his phone, which remains at two bars.
text: Paul then decides to make a different call, this time to a
text: phone number he has committed to memory: his employer back in
text: the U.S., Crestin, Roland and Thomas (CRT).
text: He closes the lid of the Zippo, extinguishing the flame.
text: After a few rings, a CRT OPERATOR answers.
speaker_heading: CRT OPERATOR
dialog: Thank you for calling Crestin,
dialog: Roland and Thomas. How may I
dialog: direct your call?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Somebody, I need to talk to someone
dialog: right away. It's an emergency.
speaker_heading: CRT OPERATOR
dialog: Who is this, please?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Paul Conroy. I'm a driver for you
dialog: guys. I'm calling from Iraq. My
text: convoy was attacked.
speaker_heading: CRT OPERATOR
dialog: Sir, if this is a crisis situation
dialog: you need to contact the Safety
dialog: Number your were provided.
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I know, I know, but I don't have
dialog: it. They took it.
speaker_heading: CRT OPERATOR
dialog: Who took it, sir?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The Iraqis, I think. I don't
dialog: remember, I blacked out.
speaker_heading: CRT OPERATOR
dialog: I'm going to put you through to
dialog: Alan Davenport.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Davenport? Who's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRT OPERATOR
dialog: Director of Personnel. Please
dialog: hold.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Personnel? No, I need to talk --
text: Paul is placed on hold. Synthesized soft rock plays in the
text: background of the phone, maddening Paul further. Over the
text: music, a CRT SPOKESMAN is heard, speaking a recorded
text: testimonial during the on-hold message.
speaker_heading: CRT SPOKESMAN
dialog: At CRT, we work with our clients to
dialog: provide effective and sustainable
dialog: solutions to the challenges they
dialog: face in our fast-growing, global
dialog: economy. As the premiere...
dialog: 
text: The message is interrupted by ALAN DAVENPORT's outgoing voice
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: You've reached Alan Davenport,
dialog: personnel director at Crestin,
dialog: Roland and Thomas. Please leave
dialog: your name and number at the tone
dialog: and I will return your call as soon
dialog: as possible.
text: The BEEP sounds. Paul is confused as to why he was patched
text: through to someone in human resources, but leaves a message
dialog: nevertheless.
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This is Paul Conroy, I'm from
dialog: Hastings, Michigan. I'm a driver
dialog: for CRT, and my convoy was
dialog: ambushed...by insurgents or
dialog: terrorists. I don't know. I don't
dialog: know who it was. I'm stuck in the
dialog: ground, buried in a coffin and I
dialog: need help. Please send help. I'm
dialog: begging you. I think I'm in
text: Baqubah in the Diyala Provence.
dialog: Please send help right away. I
dialog: can't breathe in here. I
dialog: can't...please. I'm begging you.
dialog: I don't know who else to call.
dialog: I...
dialog: 
text: Paul notices that his phone has again lost signal.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (EXASPERATED)
dialog: ...fuck.
text: Paul drops the phone to his side, the screen still emitting
text: its glow.
text: He explodes with a mixture of rage and fear. He screams and
text: flails his feet and hands wildly, banging them against the
text: walls of the coffin. His animalistic outburst causes the
dialog: phone to close.
text: The coffin returns to pitch black.
text: After a long beat, Paul lights the Zippo, which remains
text: wedged in the sand compacted against the small hole in the
text: wall of the coffin.
dialog: 
text: Paul takes a few moments to catch his breath. He looks again
text: at the cell phone. Remembers receiving a Text Message.
text: The icon on the phone's display indicates that he does, in
text: fact, have an unread Text Message waiting for him.
text: Paul quickly scrolls through the phone's menu, which is all
text: written in Arabic, until he reaches what appears to be the
text: Text Message option. Opening it, he sees a series of ten
dialog: numbers.
text: Using his click-up pencil, he scribbles the numbers onto the
text: top of the coffin. Next to the number, he writes the word
text: "HELP?" Noticing that his phone has again picked-up a
text: signal, he dials the number.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: It rings once, but then the reception begins to falter.
text: After only two rings, the call is ended. Paul's frustration
text: mounts. He is barely able to fight off another fit of
text: hysterics. He dials the number again.
text: It rings once. A second ring. In the middle of the third
text: ring, someone answers -- but they do not say anything.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?
dialog: Hello?
text: After a beat, Paul hears breathing on the other end of the
text: phone. He also hears a discordance of background sound; the
text: din of a room filled with Arabic-speaking men.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello? Who are you? Please, you
dialog: have to help me.
text: Still, Paul's words are only met with slow, measured breaths.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Who is this? Hello?
text: The person on the other end eventually speaks. An Iraqi man,
text: JABIR, talks forcefully and aggressively in broken English.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Breathe no breathe, American? Ah?
dialog: Breathe no breathe?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What? I don't know what you're
dialog: saying. Who is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: American can breathe no breathe?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, I can't breathe. Please get me
dialog: out of here.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Get out?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes, please get me out. Help me.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Soldier.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, no I'm not a soldier. I'm a
dialog: truck driver. That's it. I'm not
dialog: a soldier. I'm a contractor.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Contractor?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes, that's right. A contractor.
dialog: Not a soldier.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Blackwater.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, not for Blackwater. I'm not a
dialog: security contractor. Truck driver,
dialog: I'm a truck driver. That's all.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You are American.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Then you are soldier.
text: Despair falls upon Paul. It becomes clear that Jabir is
text: responsible for all of this. As such, Paul crosses out the
text: word "HELP?" Closes the lid of the Zippo, leaving only the
text: cell phone display screen to illuminate his face.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, I'm not. I'm here unarmed.
dialog: But, you still shot at us.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: In head and in throat, so you tell
dialog: no more lies.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm not lying! We were all
dialog: drivers.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Drive what?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Trucks. The big trucks you see
dialog: driving around with the supplies?
dialog: That's us. That's me. We're not
dialog: soldiers.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Five million money.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Five million money tonight by nine
dialog: PM or you stay. Buried like dog.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Five million dollars? From who?
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Your family.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: My family doesn't have five million
dialog: dollars. If they did, I wouldn't
dialog: be here.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: From Embassy.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't know, yes, the Embassy will
dialog: pay you. If you let me go, they'll
dialog: pay you the money.
text: Silence on the other end of the phone.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: (after a long beat)
dialog: Nine PM, five million money.
text: Jabir hangs up the phone, forcing Paul to instantly come to
text: grips with the fact that he is being held hostage.
text: He lays back in the coffin, shell-shocked. Physically spent,
text: the cell phone falls from his hands and onto the floor. The
text: display screen casts a dim light throughout the coffin.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. COFFIN - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Zippo lights. Paul holds it in his hand, using it to
text: illuminate the inside of the coffin. He attempts to push it
text: into its now customary resting place, but the sand has
text: loosened, making it difficult for the Zippo to stay in place.
text: It almost falls to the floor.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Looking around, Paul sees there is a crack between two
text: planks, located on the opposite wall of the coffin. He
text: wedges the lit Zippo into the crack.
text: With his hands now free, Paul haphazardly positions himself
text: so that his back is facing the top of the coffin.
text: His every move is arduous; the claustrophobic nature of the
text: coffin bearing down on him.
text: Paul positions his bent knees underneath his chest, with his
text: shins and feet pressed against the bottom of the coffin.
text: Using the strength of his legs, he attempts to lift the top
text: off the coffin with his back.
text: Trickles of sand fall in from the side of the coffin,
text: sprinkling against the wooden base.
dialog: 
text: He fails, only to immediately try again. And again. And
text: again. Exhaustion sets in.
text: Staring ahead, the phone sits in front of him. He notices
text: that the battery life bars are still at one solid and one
text: blinking.
text: He grabs the cell phone, staring at it, trying to think of
dialog: someone else to call.
text: The battery life is limited. Every call has to count.
text: He tries to remember some phone numbers, but has trouble
dialog: recalling the information.
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Come on, what's her number?
dialog: 
text: He cannot remember the number he's thinking of. He notices
text: that the flame of the Zippo flickers, indicating its use of
text: his much-needed oxygen. Paul closes the lid, extinguishing
text: the flame.
text: A second later, we see him, lit by the cell phone display
text: screen. He dials the international code for the United
text: States, followed by 411 information.
text: A MALE 411 OPERATOR answers.
scene_heading: MALE 411 OPERATOR
dialog: What city and listing, please?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hastings, Michigan. I'm looking
dialog: for Donna Mitchell.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MALE 411 OPERATOR
dialog: I have two Donna Mitchells, sir.
dialog: One on Federal Road and one on
text: Ardmore Avenue.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ardmore Avenue...I think. Yeah.
dialog: Shit, I don't know. Just give me
dialog: that one.
scene_heading: MALE 411 OPERATOR
dialog: Ardmore Avenue?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes, Ardmore Avenue.
scene_heading: MALE 411 OPERATOR
dialog: Please hold for your number.
text: Paul is switched to an AUTOMATED MESSAGE.
scene_heading: AUTOMATED MESSAGE
dialog: The number you requested, 269-948-
dialog: 1998 can automatically be dialed
dialog: for a charge of twenty-five cents
dialog: by pressing the number one.
text: Paul writes Donna's number and name on the top of the coffin
text: and then presses the number one. He is connected.
text: Her phone rings and rings. Paul's frustration is evident.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Come on! Where the hell is
dialog: everyone?
dialog: 
text: The phone rings some more. Paul checks the battery life --
text: still at one and a half bars.
text: DONNA eventually answers.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Hello?
text: Hearing her voice, Paul hurriedly places the phone to his
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Donna, it's Paul.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Hey, how's it going?
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Where's Linda? She's not answering
dialog: her phone. I need to talk to her,
dialog: I've been taken hostage by...
text: Donna interrupts. We realize, as does Paul, that her voice
text: was actually coming from her answering machine.
speaker_heading: DONNA
speaker_heading: (OVERLAPPING)
dialog: Fooled you. I'm not really home.
dialog: But if you leave a message, I'll
dialog: get back to you as soon as I get
dialog: in. Bye-bye.
text: His hand falls to his forehead, defeated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Donna, I need to talk to Linda.
dialog: It's an absolute emergency. Have
dialog: her call me. Use star sixty-nine
dialog: and find out the number I'm calling
dialog: from and have her call me...
text: Donna picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Donna.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I need to talk to Linda. Where is
dialog: she?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I don't know. I haven't talked to
dialog: her all day. Call her cell phone.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Are you near a computer or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Uh...yeah. Why?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Turn it on.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONNA
text: It is on.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Look up the number for the State
dialog: Department for me.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I was just heading out to the
dialog: supermarket. I really don't have
speaker_heading: TIME --
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Donna, please, please, please --
dialog: just get me the number.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Is everything alright?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No! Everything is not alright!
dialog: So, please, just look up the
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Don't fucking yell at me, Paul.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm not yelling!
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Yes you are. Just like you did
dialog: last year at the cookout. I'm not
dialog: going to tolerate --
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (EXPLODING)
dialog: Just get me the fucking number!!
dialog: Get me the number, get me the
dialog: number!!
text: Donna hangs up on him. Realizing this, Paul bangs his fists
text: and claws at the top of the coffin, bloodying some of his
text: fingers and knuckles in the process.
text: He violently tosses and turns and screams at the top of his
text: lungs, like an animal trapped in a cage. Tears spray from
text: his eyes as spit shakes free from his mouth by the force of
text: his shudder.
text: He eventually calms quite a bit. Sniffing away tears and
text: taking notice of the damage he's done to his hands, Paul
text: slows his breathing as best he can.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He lies there, motionless.
text: The silence is almost comforting. Paul closes his eyes,
text: regretfully accepting what appears will be his inescapable
dialog: fate.
text: After a beat, he calls Donna back. Knowing it is Paul
text: calling, she answers right away, attitude at the ready.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What?
text: It takes every ounce of Paul's being to keep himself from
text: going off the deep end. He takes a beat to compose himself
text: and then finally offers a very delicate and deliberate
dialog: response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Donna, I'm very sorry I yelled.
dialog: But, I'm only going to ask you once
dialog: more to get me this number. If you
dialog: don't get me this number, I'm going
dialog: to die.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: I don't have time to explain.
dialog: Please...the number.
speaker_heading: DONNA
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Hold on.
text: We hear Donna put down the phone. In the b.g., we hear the
text: sound of keys being pressed on a computer keyboard.
text: After a beat, she picks the phone back up.
speaker_heading: DONNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay...State Department. It's 202-
text: 134-4750.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: 202-134-4750?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Yeah.
text: Paul writes the number on the top of the coffin, beneath the
text: man others. He writes the initials "S.D." next to it.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What the hell's going --
text: Paul hangs up on Donna mid-sentence. He dials the number the
text: State Department right away.
text: A STATE DEPARTMENT REP answers after a few rings.
scene_heading: STATE DEPARTMENT REP
dialog: United States Department of State.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm an American citizen, working in
dialog: Iraq. I've been taken hostage. I
dialog: need to speak to someone right
dialog: away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: STATE DEPARTMENT REP
dialog: Where are you calling from, sir?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: From Iraq. I'm a truck driver for
dialog: CRT -- Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
dialog: We were attacked and now I'm being
text: held for ransom.
scene_heading: STATE DEPARTMENT REP
dialog: Are the kidnappers with you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. I'm buried somewhere.
scene_heading: STATE DEPARTMENT REP
dialog: You're buried?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Yeah, in a coffin, a wooden box.
dialog: It's an old coffin, I think.
scene_heading: STATE DEPARTMENT REP
dialog: Did you try contacting the military
dialog: out there?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't have the number.
scene_heading: STATE DEPARTMENT REP
dialog: What number?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I was given a number to call, a
dialog: safety number. But the people took
dialog: it.
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: STATE DEPARTMENT REP
dialog: The people holding you hostage?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: STATE DEPARTMENT REP
speaker_heading: (DISCONCERTED)
dialog: I don't know...hold on. Let me
dialog: connect you...hold on.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. Wait...
text: Paul is placed on hold. As he waits, his eyes wander around
text: the coffin. He looks at the numbers he has written.
dialog: 
text: After a moment, REBECCA BROWNING, a State Department
text: official, picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Rebecca Browning.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yes, hello. I was just informed of
dialog: your situation.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah, my situation. I'm running
dialog: out of time and you people keep
dialog: putting me on hold. What the hell
dialog: is wrong with you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Don't be sorry. Just help me.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I just have a few questions for
dialog: you, Mister Conroy.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You've got to be kidding me.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It's important that I get this
dialog: information. It will make a rescue
scene_heading: ATTEMPT --
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wait, wait, wait...how did you know
dialog: my name?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I never gave you my name. I don't
dialog: think I gave it to the other guy,
dialog: either.
text: Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell is going on right
dialog: now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: We received a call from a
dialog: representative at CRT. You left
dialog: him a message?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah...?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: He contacted us right away.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, since you know what the hell
dialog: is going on, what have you done to
dialog: get me out of here?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: There's little we can do from
dialog: Washington.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So, that's it? I'm just supposed
dialog: to rot in here because there's
dialog: little you can do?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Then what?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I need to know where you were when
dialog: your convoy was ambushed.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: In the Diyala Provence. In
dialog: Baqubah.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Okay. And has contact been made
dialog: with the kidnappers?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. The guy told me that he wants
dialog: five million dollars by nine
dialog: o'clock tonight.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Or else...?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Or else he'll bring me to Sea
dialog: World. What do you think, lady?
text: Even faced with Paul's sarcasm, Rebecca remains stolid.
dialog: Professional.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We'll do everything we can.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So you'll pay them?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: No. That we can't do.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wait...what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It's the policy of the United
dialog: States government to not negotiate
dialog: with terrorists.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: To hell with that! It's easy for
dialog: you to worry about policy, you're
text: sitting in an air conditioned
dialog: office somewhere, probably
dialog: finishing up your sandwich from
dialog: lunch. You're not the one stuck in
text: a coffin, buried in the God damn
dialog: desert!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I understand your frustration --
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Frustration? Lady, I'm going to
dialog: fucking die in here. Understand
dialog: that!
text: Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone. Paul
text: wonders if she is still there. The idea of being alone again
text: scares him terribly.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
text: Worried, Paul lights the Zippo. The reflection of the flame
text: dances on his frightened eyes.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm here.
dialog: 
text: Momentary relief. After a beat:
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, then say something. Tell me
dialog: how you're going to get me out of
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What's the number on the phone
dialog: you're calling from?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't know. Did it come up on
dialog: your end?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No. It's listed as unavailable.
dialog: Do this -- take down this number.
dialog: 
text: Paul takes out his pen.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
scene_heading: 410-195-5453.
text: Paul writes the number onto the top of the coffin.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Dan Brenner. He's the commander of
dialog: the Hostage Working Group over in
dialog: Iraq.
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Paul writes "D. BRENNER" next to Dan's phone number.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hostage Working Group?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We formed it in 2004 to deal with
dialog: situations such as yours.
text: Paul shakes his head in disgust.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Situations. I love how you keep
dialog: calling it that.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Did you write down the number?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Good. Hold on, I'll connect you
dialog: with him now. He should be
dialog: expecting you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What about the news? I'm going to
dialog: call them.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No. Do not, I repeat, do not
dialog: contact the news.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It will only complicate things
dialog: further and threaten your chances
dialog: of rescue.
text: Paul doesn't buy it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's bullshit. You're just
dialog: covering your ass.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No, I'm covering yours. Everyone
dialog: who needs to know about this does.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You don't go looking for something
dialog: if you don't know it's missing.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That's why you need to contact Dan
text: Brenner right away.
text: Paul still contemplates contacting the news, but soon
text: acquiesces to Rebecca's pleas for him not to.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm transferring you now.
dialog: 
text: Rebecca's gone. Paul waits. Several beeps sound as he's
dialog: being transferred.
text: Paul hears a faint sound coming from behind him, outside the
text: coffin. While the beeps continue to sound, he lights the
text: Zippo, circumspectly looking behind him. He doesn't see
dialog: anything.
text: With the Zippo still lit, Paul takes a deep, centering
text: breath, followed by another.
text: A few more long beeps pass before a ring is heard. After two
text: rings, DAN BRENNER answers.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Brenner.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Dan Brenner?
dialog: 
text: Dan is quick to figure out who it is that must be calling
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Is this Paul Conroy?
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (EXCITED)
dialog: Yes, yes it's me. It's Paul.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Paul, I was informed of what's
dialog: going on. I want you to know that
dialog: we're already working on trying to
dialog: get you out of there.
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Paul is relieved. His first glint of hope has appeared.
text: Tears of joy instantly escape his eyes.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, thank you, God.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I was told that we have until 9pm.
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's what he said.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Alright. That doesn't give us a
dialog: whole lot of time. And just so I
dialog: have this right, the kidnappers
dialog: buried you in the ground?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Yeah, in an old, wooden coffin.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Okay. My guess is that since
dialog: you're able to get a cell signal,
dialog: you're no more than a few feet
text: underground.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't know. Maybe.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: What about battery life? How much
dialog: does the phone have left?
text: Paul looks at the display to find out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Less than half.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Okay. You have to conserve that
dialog: battery. Our best bet of finding
dialog: you is by tracking your cell
text: signal. Is the ringer set on a
dialog: sound or vibrate?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Vibrate.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Press and hold down the asterisk
dialog: key to change it to a ring tone.
dialog: It will use less power.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What about my Zippo?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You have a lighter?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Use it to look around for markings,
dialog: a logo -- whatever you can find.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Won't it use up oxygen?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Not much. Don't worry about that
dialog: now. Try to find --
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's really dark in here without
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I understand, Paul. Try to find
dialog: anything in there that might
dialog: indicate where that coffin was
dialog: made.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You guys have to hurry.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We're working as fast as we can,
dialog: Paul.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Do you know if there were any other
dialog: survivors?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: From your convoy?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: That's still unclear at this point.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I just wanted to do right by my
dialog: family. That's all.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't know it was going to be
dialog: like this over here.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I don't think any of us did.
text: While on the phone with Brenner, Paul gets another call
text: coming in. He checks the display and reads the number.
text: Matching it against a number he wrote on the top of the
text: coffin, he sees that is Jabir calling.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: It's him. He's calling.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: The kidnapper?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah. What do I do?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You know his number?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Give it to me.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What about the call?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Give me the number first.
text: The phone has rung several times. Paul fears that Jabir may
dialog: hang up.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: He's going to hang up.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Take the call.
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: BUT --
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Take the call. Now.
text: Paul complies with Dan's demand and switches to the other
dialog: line.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: JABIR
text: Two hour, six minute.
text: Paul looks at his watch. Indeed, he has but two hours and
text: six minutes until the time reaches 9pm.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You have to give me more time.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You talk to embassy? They give
dialog: money?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. No. I talked to...someone.
dialog: Government. They said that they
dialog: won't pay the money.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: No pay?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. They said that they don't
dialog: negotiate with terrorists.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Terrorists? I am terrorist?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. You are terrorist, you son of
dialog: a bitch.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You are terrified, so I am
dialog: terrorist?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What did I ever do to you?
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Ever do?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah. I'm here because it's a job,
dialog: to make money. That's it.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: I have job until you come. Now, my
dialog: family have nothing.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's not my fault!
text: Jabir retorts with a spirited conviction similar to Paul's.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Nine, one, one was not my fault,
dialog: but still you are here! Saddam was
dialog: not my fault, but still you are
dialog: here!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I told you, I'm only here to work.
dialog: To help rebuild.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Rebuild what you destroyed.
dialog: 
text: Paul cannot handle his stress any longer. He begins to
text: crumble under the pressure.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Stop! Just please, stop! I'm just
dialog: a guy. I'm just a truck driver.
dialog: Okay? I'm nobody that makes
dialog: decisions about anything. I just
dialog: want to go home.
text: Silence from the other end of the phone for an extended
dialog: period of time.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You make video, ransom video.
text: This surprisingly comes as good news to Paul.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. Please. Get me out of here
dialog: and I'll make the video.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: No. You make video now.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What...? How?
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You use video on phone.
text: Paul's hopes are dashed. His sanguine head falls back onto
text: the coffin floor.
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JABIR (CONT'D)
dialog: Near foot. You read note near foot
dialog: in box.
text: Paul shines the flame of his Zippo lighter toward his feet.
text: He doesn't see anything.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Where? I don't see --
speaker_heading: JABIR
text: Near foot. Read note inside box.
text: Paul repositions his legs as best he can. He can vaguely see
text: the corner of a small metal box, partially sticking out of a
text: broken plank on the bottom of the coffin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The video...if I make it, will you
dialog: let me go?
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Only if we get money.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Nobody's going to pay five million
dialog: dollars for me.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: We take less. One million money.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: If they pay it, will you let me go?
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: One million money.
text: Jabir hangs up, ending the call.
text: Paul sits motionless for a moment, soaking in all that Jabir
dialog: has just told him.
text: He again looks down toward his feet. He can see the
text: protruding corner of the metal box, but it's positioned in
text: such a way that it will clearly not be easy for him to reach
dialog: it.
text: Paul then tries to clasp the box with his feet, but after
text: several unsuccessful attempts, he realizes that a new
dialog: strategy is necessary.
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He makes efforts to reposition himself in the coffin, so that
text: his head and feet will ultimately switch places. He
text: struggles, inch by troubled inch, to make this maneuver.
text: Sweat pours down the side of his face. The extremely tight
text: quarters of the coffin make the repositioning nearly
dialog: impossible.
text: After expending a great deal of energy doing so, Paul
text: eventually completes the turn of his body. He examines the
text: small, rusted metal box. On it is a cartoon picture of a
text: small Arab boy and girl playing with a red rubber ball.
text: Skeptical at first, Paul carefully examines the box and
text: shakes it gently. Items are heard rummaging inside.
text: He carefully opens it. A fluorescent green light shines from
text: inside.
text: Paul looks inside and finds a lit, green glow stick,
text: fluorescing brightly and now illuminating much of the coffin.
text: He closes the lid of the Zippo. Removes the stick.
text: Looking into the small box again, he finds several other
text: items: a small, disused flashlight; a second, unlit glow
text: stick; a jackknife; and lastly, a folded piece of paper.
text: He slowly unfolds the piece of paper. We see that his ransom
text: message is written in an unintelligible mix of English and
dialog: Arabic.
text: Paul shakes his head and lets out a sigh of disgust. He
text: crumbles up the paper into a ball and listlessly drops it to
text: his side. He covers his face with his hands, his labored
text: breaths echoing in his palms.
dialog: 
text: Under the low-light of the green glow stick, Paul picks up
text: the phone and dials his home.
text: Per usual, he gets the answering machine. His son, Shane, is
text: heard on outgoing message.
speaker_heading: SHANE
dialog: Thanks for calling the Conroy's.
dialog: We're not home right now. Please
text: leave a message at the beep.
dialog: Thanks.
text: Paul's eyes well up with tears. He smiles at the sound of
text: his son's voice. The Beep is heard. Paul hangs up without
text: leaving a message.
text: He looks at the time. It's 7:02pm. Battery life is holding
text: steady at one and a half bars. He remembers something.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Shit.
text: Paul presses and holds down the shortcut button on the phone
text: that changes the ringer from vibrate to an audible tone.
text: The glow stick begins to slowly fade.
text: Paul dials Dan Brenner.
text: After a few rings, Dan answers.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Here's his number...
dialog: 
text: Paul presses the green key, bringing up the last numbers
dialog: dialed and received.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Hold on. Alright, go ahead.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: It's 07902-24-921.
text: Dan says something to someone who is in the room with him,
text: and then returns his attention to Paul.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: This is huge. Unless they're using
dialog: a cloned line, we should be able to
dialog: find where this is coming from in
dialog: minutes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What about me? Can you track my
dialog: cell signal?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We're having a lot of trouble with
dialog: yours. Seems to be an EDS line,
dialog: probably through one of the
dialog: Egyptian carriers.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That...it's not going to be easy.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: He wants me to make a ransom video.
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: No. Hold off for as long as you
dialog: can.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: If it's going to get me out of
dialog: here, I'm making it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: The last thing we want is for this
text: to end up all over Al Jazeera.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We?
text: Paul becomes angry, again sensing that more emphasis is being
text: placed on containing the situation than rescuing him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: This can't turn into an
dialog: international incident.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's all you people care about!
dialog: But what about me? Don't you care
dialog: about me?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We do. That's why we're --
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No you don't! You people don't
dialog: care about any of us. I've had
dialog: eight friends killed out here, six
dialog: of them today. We don't have any
dialog: guns, any armor. Nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You're not soldiers.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Tell that to the people who put me
dialog: in this box! Tell that to the
dialog: people who shot my friends!
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We're doing the best we can.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, you're not. All you people
dialog: understand are your secret plans
dialog: and your back room politics.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: If I were some diplomat or
dialog: something, maybe even a hostage
dialog: working group leader -- or whatever
dialog: your fancy title is, I'd be out of
dialog: here by now. Wouldn't I? But I'm
dialog: not, so I'm just supposed to keep
dialog: my mouth shut and die.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I need you to stay focused, Paul.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Fuck you.
dialog: Dan's heard enough.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Paul, listen to me: finding you is
dialog: our primary concern. Bottom line.
dialog: And we're searching just as hard as
dialog: we would be for a four-star
dialog: general, so don't literally waste
dialog: your breath suggesting otherwise.
text: Paul does not respond at first. Dan's retort clearly has an
dialog: effect on him.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Who are they? The people who put
dialog: me here?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: They're just that -- people. No
dialog: different from you and me.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm no terrorist.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Neither are they.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: If you were homeless,
dialog: starving...actually, I take that
dialog: back. If your family was homeless
dialog: and starving, what would you do for
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I wouldn't kill someone.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: How can you be sure?
speaker_heading: PAUL
scene_heading: (GETTING FRUSTRATED)
dialog: What difference does it make?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: They're criminals, desperate ones
dialog: at that. They don't care about
dialog: anything other than getting the
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So pay them, then.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Trust me, if it was an option, I
dialog: would do that in a heartbeat.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How many others have there been?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Since I got here? Hundreds.
dialog: Journalists, contractors,
dialog: soldiers...hundreds have been
dialog: taken. It's one of the only
text: functioning businesses out here.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How many have you rescued?
text: Dan is reluctant to answer the question.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: DAN
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Not many.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Tell me their names.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Any of them. Make me know they
dialog: really do matter to you.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Mark White.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Who was Mark White?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: A kid from New Hampshire. Twenty-
dialog: six years old. Med student. Came
dialog: over here to help out local
dialog: doctors.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What happened to him?
speaker_heading: DAN
text: Insurgents grabbed him.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: When?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: About three weeks ago.
text: Paul writes "MARK WHITE" on the top of the coffin, below the
text: list of phone numbers. He circles the name.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You remember his name.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I remember all their names.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (afraid to ask)
dialog: Did he...? Is he...?
text: The glow stick begins to fade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, Paul, he's alive.
text: Hearing this affords Paul some semblance of relief.
text: Paul shakes the glow stick, returning it to its full
dialog: strength.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: DAN
text: Home. Probably happy to be back at
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I want to get out of here.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We found him; we'll find you, too.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We already have a solid lead on the
dialog: number you gave us.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: A unit's on it's way over there
dialog: now.
dialog: 
text: This news calms Paul's nerves.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's...that's good.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What should I do in the meantime?
speaker_heading: DAN
text: I know it's hard, but try to relax.
dialog: The more worked up you are, the
dialog: more air you're going to use.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can't help it. I'm always
text: anxious. I take pills for it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Do you have them with you?
text: Paul checks his pants pockets. He removes a small, orange
text: pill bottle.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Take them. You need to preserve
dialog: your oxygen level any way you can.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Is your Zippo still lit.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Not now.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I feel nauseous.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You have to calm down.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm trying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: And you need to save that battery.
dialog: We're expecting some intel in about
dialog: ten minutes. Call me back then.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Just hang in there, Paul.
text: The glow stick begins to slowly fade. Paul shakes it,
text: causing it to brighten only momentarily before dimming again.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah. I'm trying.
text: Dan ends the call. Paul lets out a deep breath, finding it
dialog: difficult to lay claim to its replacement.
text: He looks at his watch. It's now 7:18pm. The ticking sound
text: of the second hand turning is inordinately loud, due to the
text: extreme silence of the coffin.
text: Just then, the cell phone rings. Checking the number on the
text: display, Paul sees that it is Jabir.
text: Paul answers.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Did you make video?
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No.
text: Jabir yells something in Arabic to the other Iraqi men we
text: hear in the background.
text: Collectively, they do not sound pleased. Slightly panicked,
text: in fact, though it is difficult to tell for sure.
speaker_heading: JABIR
speaker_heading: (TO PAUL)
dialog: You make video!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Let me out and I'll make it.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: No! You make video now. In box.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can't. I can't read the paper.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Make video now!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can't. I don't know what you
dialog: want me to say. I can't read the
dialog: paper.
text: Jabir is heard speaking with the men we hear arguing in the
text: background. Although they speak in Arabic, it is clear from
text: their tone that they are becoming worried and increasingly
dialog: hostile.
text: Jabir returns his attention back to Paul.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You make video now.
text: Jabir ends the call. Paul closes the phone to help conserve
dialog: battery life.
text: He then reopens the phone and scrolls through the menu
text: options. Everything is written in Arabic. He eventually
text: comes across an icon with a movie camera -- the video
text: function. He turns it on. Looks at himself though the
text: viewfinder.
text: After a beat, he closes the phone, clearly frustrated and
text: growing more panicked. His breaths grow heavy and rapid,
dialog: utilizing a great deal of oxygen.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm never getting out of here.
text: Paul begins to freak out, restlessly squirming inside the
text: coffin and pressing against the sides and top.
text: The glow stick fades out almost completely, offering very
text: little light. Paul shakes it, but with no change to its
text: brightness. Moments later, it dies. Paul tries the
text: flashlight. Click-click. Click-click. Nothing.
text: He bangs it a few times with his hand. The white light turns
text: on, but quickly turns back off. He twists the top, which
text: causes the flashlight to switch bulbs. A red beam emits
text: momentarily. Paul twists the top again and gives the
dialog: flashlight a few good whacks.
dialog: 
text: It turns on. White light shines dimly on his face.
text: He takes a breath.
text: In efforts to calm himself, he once again removes the orange
text: pill bottle from his pocket. He pours two into his hand. He
text: then removes his small, metal alcohol flask from his back
text: pocket and takes a large swig, swallowing the two pills in
dialog: the process.
text: Still, Paul's heavy, labored breathing continues. He drops
text: four additional pills into his and swallows them with yet
text: another generous pull from the flask.
text: He sits and waits. Nothing is happening, except that his
text: extremely limited time keeps passing.
text: After a moment, Paul picks up the cell phone. He holds it in
text: front of him, hesitant to make a call. After some
text: consideration, he dials.
text: After a few rings, a NURSING HOME NURSE answers.
scene_heading: NURSING HOME NURSE
dialog: Mountain View Nursing Home.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I was hoping I could speak with
dialog: Maryanne Conroy, please.
scene_heading: NURSING HOME NURSE
dialog: Um...okay. Ah...let me bring the
text: cordless phone to her room. Hold
dialog: on a moment, please.
text: We hear the Nurse walk down the tiled corridor floor. She
text: soon reaches Paul's mother's room.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: NURSING HOME NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Misses Conroy, you have a telephone
dialog: call, dear. Here, you can use this
dialog: phone.
text: Paul's mother, MARYANNE, answers. Her voice is pleasant but
text: confused. It's clear that she suffers from advanced stages
dialog: of Alzheimer's Disease.
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Mom...it's Paul.
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's Paul, Mom. Your son.
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: My son?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's okay, Mom. How are you?
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's good.
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's your son, Mom. It's Paulie.
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: Paulie?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah. Remember? We lived over on
text: Colfax Street, in the duplex.
dialog: Remember?
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
scene_heading: (REMEMBERING SLIGHTLY)
dialog: Paulie?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's right, Mom.
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: Is this Paulie?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It is, Mom. It's Paulie. How's
dialog: everything at the home?
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: Very nice. Your father and I have
dialog: been playing gin rummy every night.
text: It's almost too much for Paul to take. He cries silent tears
text: over a heartbroken smile.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah...I don't think Pop's there
dialog: with you, Mom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: How are you doing, sweetie?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Not very good. This...uh, this may
dialog: be the last time I talk to you.
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: That's nice, honey.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Did you get the flowers I sent a
dialog: few months ago?
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: Flowers?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah, I sent...never mind. Listen,
dialog: I...I'm going to go now. I just
dialog: wanted to talk to you, you know,
dialog: just to say bye. I love you, Mom.
text: Maryanne doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: PAUL(CONT'D)
dialog: Did you hear me? Mom? I told
dialog: you...do you want to tell me you
speaker_heading: LOVE --
speaker_heading: MARYANNE
dialog: Yes, dear. Your father and I have
dialog: been playing gin rummy every night.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Okay, Mom. Tell Pop I said hi.
text: Paul ends the call and instantly begins crying his heart out.
text: He lays there, sobbing relentlessly.
text: After a long beat, the cell phone rings. Decidedly different
text: than his past reactions to an incoming call, Paul seems
text: hopelessly disinterested. The ring is maddening.
text: He mindlessly presses the shortcut button, resetting the ring
text: to vibrate mode.
text: He eventually picks up the phone, but there is not anyone on
text: the other end. It's then that he sees that it was not a call
text: that came in, but instead was a picture message.
text: Pressing what appears to be the Accept button, the incoming
text: picture begins to download.
text: Several seconds later, the picture downloads and an image
text: appears on the display of Paul's cell phone. It's of a woman
text: -- bound and gagged, a gun pressed against the side of her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh no. No, no, no!
text: Paul frantically dials the number to reach Jabir. As soon as
text: the phone connects, Paul begins his desperate plea.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Video make?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Let her go. Please. Please don't
text: hurt her.
text: The Woman is heard in the background of Jabir's phone, crying
text: muffled words through her muzzled mouth.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: We shoot her if you no make video.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No! No, please no shoot. No shoot
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You get money. American million.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I will, I promise. Just don't
dialog: shoot her. She's a mother, she's
dialog: got two kids.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Two kids?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. She has two kids.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: I have five. Now only one. You
dialog: make video. Now!!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wait...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: No wait!! I give three seconds.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can't read the paper.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Three...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. Wait!
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Two...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't know what you want me to
dialog: say!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: One.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Okay! Okay, I'll make the video.
dialog: Just, please, don't shoot.
text: Jabir does not fire his gun. Paul attempts to catch his
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to hang up to make the
dialog: video. Okay? Is that okay?
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You have three minute to send
dialog: video.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jabir hangs up, ending the call.
text: Paul reaches for the balled-up piece of paper that has the
text: ransom script written on it. It takes some trouble for him
text: to grab it, but he is soon able to.
text: Placing the flashlight next to the paper, Paul is again
text: reminded of the incoherent nature of the script.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (re: the script)
dialog: Fuck...
text: He drops the paper to his side and opens the phone, setting
text: it to the video record function. He places the flashlight
text: close to his face so as to make his image more visible on the
text: small, phone display screen.
dialog: 
text: He presses the record button.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (speaking at the phone)
dialog: My name is Paul Conroy. I'm an
dialog: American citizen from Hastings,
dialog: Michigan. I'm a civilian truck
dialog: driver for Crestin, Roland and
dialog: Thomas. I've been taken hostage
dialog: somewhere in Iraq...and I need one
dialog: million dollars by nine o'clock
dialog: tonight, Baghdad time, or else I'll
dialog: be left to die in this coffin I'm
dialog: buried in. I've been told that
dialog: if...
text: The flashlight goes out. Paul continues speaking in the
text: darkness. After a few quick smacks, the flashlight turns
text: back on.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: ...the money is paid, I will be let
dialog: go. If it's not, I will die in
dialog: here. These threats are real and
dialog: will be followed through on.
text: Trying to think of more to say, Paul soon opts for not saying
text: anything further. He saves the message and then sends it to
dialog: Jabir.
text: We see that the screen displays an icon confirming the video
dialog: has been sent.
text: Paul places the phone on his chest. Still rubbing his
text: temples, his eyes begin to flutter a bit. He tries to
text: control his breathing and remain calm.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He opens the phone and displays the photo of the Woman. He
text: stares admiringly at her, hoping dearly that she will not be
dialog: harmed.
text: The effects of the anxiety pills finally taking effect, his
text: eyes soon close and he drifts off to sleep.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. COFFIN - LATER
text: Darkness once again. We hear the sound of Paul slowly
text: awaking, followed the sight of Zippo sparks.
text: It doesn't catch. The second glow stick is snapped,
text: illuminating the coffin with a fluorescent green hue.
dialog: 
text: Paul starts to move, but suddenly freezes. His eyes widen.
text: His pupils dilate. Something is clearly very wrong, though
dialog: we cannot see what.
text: His eyes slowly shift downward, as if watching something move
text: down his body. Beads of sweat form across his brow. His
text: measured breaths are held for as long as they can be.
text: Moving excruciatingly slow, Paul lowers the glow stick toward
text: what he is looking at.
text: A shape moves across his stomach, underneath his T-shirt.
text: Paul's eyes are fixed on whatever it may be. He cautiously,
text: slowly, moves the glow stick even closer.
text: The shape disappears just as the light of the glow stick
text: shines on whatever it may be. Still, Paul does not dare make
dialog: any sudden move.
dialog: 
text: Paul's pant leg moves slightly, starting at the top, slowly
text: undulating toward his cuff.
text: Paul leans the glow stick in further. And further.
text: Carefully. Moving a millimeter at a time. He shifts the
text: position of his head slightly, charily, to see next to his
text: feet.
text: He leans in even closer with the glow stick. But then --
text: -- his wary movement comes to immediate stop.
text: It's a snake. A two-foot, saw-scaled viper. It has
text: positioned itself in the corner of the coffin, inches from
text: Paul's feet.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: His terror evident, Paul very slowly pulls his feet back
text: toward his upper body, away from the snake. The confined
text: space offers little room for safety.
text: The snake turns its muscled neck to face Paul. Their eyes
text: meet for the first time. The snake hisses, poised to strike
text: at any moment. Paul raises his foot. Steels himself.
text: Prepares to preempt the snake with a solid stomp.
text: A more sensible plan soon prevails. After lowering his foot,
text: Paul cautiously removes the flask from his pocket. Slowly
text: unscrews the top. Splashes a small amount of alcohol on the
text: floor, close to the snake.
text: The snake recoils slightly, but then menacingly twists itself
text: into a new posture, ready to attack. Paul lowers the Zippo
text: to the small puddle of alcohol. After a few sparks --
dialog: 
text: -- it lights. A flash-fire. The snake flails and hisses
text: wildly at the other side of a small fire wall.
text: The flame soon goes out. Paul moves fast. Throws more
text: alcohol, this time some of it lands on the snake itself. He
text: places the already lit Zippo against the puddle of alcohol
text: near the snake.
text: Another flash-fire, this time burning the snake. It hisses
text: loudly. Threateningly. It swings back and forth,
text: challenging the small wall of fire.
text: The fire soon extinguishes. The snake burrows into the hole
text: from where it likely entered the coffin, disappearing into it
text: with haste.
text: Paul hurriedly stuffs the hole with his discarded button-down
text: shirt. He then pours a small amount of alcohol over the
text: shirt and temporarily puts the flask on the ground, but does
text: not screw the cap on securely. He then wedges the lit Zippo
text: between a small space between two wooden planks.
text: With the snake situation handled, Paul finally lets out a
text: sigh of relief. Rubs his eyes. Tries to regain his
text: faculties. Looks over the list of phone numbers written
text: above him.
text: Suddenly, the cell phone vibrates. Paul frenziedly searches
text: for it, but he cannot find it. He then notices it has fallen
text: into the small hole near his feet, out of his reach.
text: He makes several attempts to grab the phone with his feet,
text: but he is unable to do so. It continues to ring.
text: His next efforts involve repositioning himself in the coffin
text: so that he completely turns to face the opposite end.
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Struggling through each move, Paul painstakingly begins to
text: turn himself. While turning, however, he inadvertently kicks
text: the Zippo from the side of the coffin -- landing it on the
text: floor, up against the glow stick -- and knocks over the
text: flask.
text: We see that the flame of the Zippo slowly melts the plastic
text: glow stick, causing it to dim slightly.
text: Worst still, and completely unbeknownst to Paul, a stream of
text: alcohol slowly makes its way from the flask and toward the
text: flame of the lighter, threatening to set the coffin ablaze.
text: Inch by inch, the flammable spirit gets closer.
text: Still in the midst of his repositioning, Paul looks back and
text: sees the alcohol nearing the flame. In a panic, he attempts
text: to reach and grab the Zippo. But, he finds himself stuck in
text: the middle of the coffin. He can't budge either way.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, no, no!!
text: Desperately straining every muscle in his body, he extends
text: his arm backward toward the Zippo, hoping to move it away
text: from the spilled alcohol. He still can't reach it, yet he
text: tries with all his might.
text: The phone stops ringing. He has missed the call.
text: He tries blowing at the flame, but his head is too far away
text: and his breath is not strong enough to do much more than
text: cause it to flicker.
text: With the alcohol now mere inches away from the flame, Paul
text: reaches for his shoe. His odd positioning makes reaching his
text: foot almost impossible. He struggles to undo the laces and
dialog: remove it from his foot.
text: With his face beet red from the force of his strain, Paul
text: finally removes his shoe. The mere inch of leg room this
text: creates allows him to slide his leg out from under him.
text: The trail of alcohol is just about to come into contact with
dialog: the flame --
text: -- but Paul deftly maneuvers his body just in time to
text: awkwardly kick the Zippo out of the way and close the lid.
text: Paul breaths an enormous sigh of relief as he sits in the dim
text: light of the damaged glow stick. He notices another hole in
text: the coffin. As a precaution, he stuffs it with the cloth
text: that had previously been used to gag him.
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Just as he is about to grab the phone, he hears what appears
text: to be the faint sound of a Muslim call to prayer being
text: announced over the citywide PA system. The sound barely
text: makes its way through the hundreds of pounds of sand that
text: envelop the coffin.
text: A sign of hope, as well as a point of reference for his
dialog: location -- albeit a very vague one.
text: He listens further as the call to prayer continues. The
text: light of the glow stick dims further.
text: Paul then opens his phone. Sees that he missed Jabir's call.
text: He starts to call Jabir back, but stops. He instead
text: navigates through the various display menus. He soon reaches
text: what appears to be the Tools Menu, though it's difficult to
text: tell because everything is written in Arabic. He becomes
text: frustrated as he fails to find what he is looking for.
text: On the verge of mental surrender, he sees something that
text: gives him pause. A smile crosses his face.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (re: the phone screen)
dialog: There you are.
text: We see, on the display of the phone, that Paul has found a
text: listing of languages. He scrolls past many -- "FRANCAIS,
text: DETSCHE, ESPANOL" -- stopping at "ENGLISH." Presses the
text: button, instantly making all the text on the screen readable.
text: He quickly navigates to the Tools menu. Scrolls down.
text: Locates the number of the cell phone he is using.
text: He scribbles the number onto the top of the coffin. Then a
text: second pass, making it bolder than the others.
text: Paul then dials his wife's cell phone. After only a few
text: rings, he is met by her voice mail.
speaker_heading: LINDA (V.O.)
dialog: Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a
dialog: message. Thanks and have a great
dialog: day.
text: The beep sounds, and Paul frantically proceeds right into his
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Linda, here's the number for the
dialog: phone. I just found it out. It's
scene_heading: 07902-42-884. You have to use the
dialog: international calling code first.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Please call me as soon as you get
dialog: this. I love you...I love you.
dialog: Call me right away. Please.
text: Paul hangs up. He looks at the battery life left on the
text: phone. One bar. He then checks his watch. It's 8:19pm.
text: Both are not good signs, and he knows it.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit.
text: He begins to panic. Grabbing the pocket knife that was left
text: inside the metal box, he slides the blade in the space
text: between the sides of the coffin and the top.
text: Paul grabs the glow stick. But, because it was partially
text: melted to the floor, the stick snaps in two. Liquid oozes
text: out of the small portion of the stick that remains stuck the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Son of a...
text: Paul grabs the flashlight. Turns it on. It works for a
text: second, but then goes out. Shaking it only produces
text: intermittent beams of light.
text: He turns the top, switching to the red bulb. It works. The
text: coffin fills with a reddish hue, but then it, too, goes out.
text: Growing incensed, Paul switches back to the white bulb. It
dialog: works.
text: He returns his attention to the coffin. His efforts to use
text: the knife as a fulcrum are futile. Still, he tries. Bending
text: the blade well past its design, it nearly breaks off its
dialog: handle.
text: The flashlight turns off. After a good shaking, it turns
text: back on, emitting white light.
dialog: With oxygen levels extremely diminished, efforts of this kind
text: are all too much for Paul to take. He has to stop and try to
text: catch his breath.
text: As he endeavors to get his wind back, the cell phone rings.
text: Not a call this time, but instead a video message. It has
dialog: been sent by Jabir.
text: Paul's trepidation is evident. He fears what the incoming
text: video may show.
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: After a beat, he presses the Accept button and the video
text: downloads. Within seconds, the video plays on his phone
text: display screen. We see, in the video, the American Woman
text: that previously appeared in a picture message that was sent
text: to Paul. She is still bound at her wrists, but her gag has
dialog: been lowered.
text: She sits on her knees. Standing behind her are three men,
text: all with their faces shielded by Arab headdresses. They each
text: hold AK-47 assault weapons.
text: Paul watches in horror as the terrified woman speaks, through
text: her tears, into the camera.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: My name is Pamela Gorham. I'm a
dialog: food service worker at F.O.B.
text: Anaconda, employed by Crestin,
dialog: Roland and Thomas. My captors'
dialog: requests for ransom have gone
dialog: unanswered, and --
text: The Woman, Pamela, looks off-screen to her right. Someone is
text: fast approaching her. She cowers, protectively holding her
text: bound hands in front of her face as she screams.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the person)
dialog: No...wait!! Please -- no!!
text: Another Iraqi man steps into the camera's line of site, a
text: handgun already brandished.
text: Without as much as a moment's hesitation, he fires two rounds
text: directly into Pamela's head, killing her.
dialog: 
text: The video message ends immediately thereafter. Paul is in
text: complete shock.
text: He screams aloud, slamming his closed fist against the bottom
text: of the coffin.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No! No, no, no!!!
text: Still in the throes of emotional torment, Paul vomits on
text: himself. He doubles over, only to vomit once again.
text: His body, taxed almost to the point of complete physical
text: breakdown, gradually slows and levels itself. With his vomit-
text: smeared face pressed cheek-down onto the bottom of the
text: coffin, Paul stares into nothingness.
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: After a beat, his eye catches a glimmer of light -- the blade
text: of the knife, reflecting off the beam of the flashlight.
text: Paul reaches for the knife. Lying on his back, still
text: suffering enormous mental strain, he places the cutting edge
text: of the blade against his neck. His jugular vein.
text: His hand shakes, his lips tremble.
text: The hand that holds the blade tightens its grip on the
text: handle. It, too, shakes.
text: Paul closes his eyes.
text: A small amount of blood begins to drip from the side of his
text: neck, where the blade of the knife rests, ready to open his
dialog: vein.
dialog: 
text: After a great deal of consideration, Paul throws the knife to
text: the foot of the coffin.
dialog: He can't do it.
text: The flashlight falls from Paul's chest. It turns off upon
text: landing on the floor of the coffin.
text: Paul sits in darkness. His breaths echo off the coffin
dialog: walls.
text: After a beat, he turns on the flashlight. It turns off after
text: less than two seconds. This time, however, he does not shake
text: it, nor does he hit it.
text: A moment later, we hear a click, followed by the sight of a
text: red light beam emitting from the flashlight. It holds
dialog: steady.
dialog: 
text: Paul shines it onto the names and phone numbers written on
text: the top of the coffin. He stops at "MARK WHITE."
text: After a beat, he lowers the flashlight to his side.
text: He picks up the phone and dials Brenner. After one ring,
text: Brenner answers. He's clearly not pleased. Paul, however,
text: is surprisingly calm. Detached. Almost disturbingly so.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Why the hell did you make that
dialog: video?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's all a bunch of lies.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: What is? What are you talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: All of it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: All of what?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Nobody gives a shit about any of
dialog: us. We're nothing to you people.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We're going to find you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: By looking the other way?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You can't start breaking on me now,
dialog: Paul. You have to stay strong.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You let her die.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: No I didn't.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: They shot her...and you didn't do
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We didn't even know she had been
text: taken hostage.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She sent three videos.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That's what they told her to say.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What do you know?
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That your ransom video already has
dialog: 47,000 hits on YouTube. And all
dialog: the major networks are playing it,
dialog: including Al Jazeera. So, now your
dialog: captors have no choice but to
dialog: follow through.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I found out the number to this
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I found a way to change the display
dialog: language. I figured that out, and
dialog: you didn't. Why?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Because I didn't. Just like you
dialog: and every other person on this
dialog: planet, there are some things I
dialog: know and some things I don't.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Then how are you ever going to find
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Their signal was cloned, like we
dialog: figured. But, we're close. Real
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What about mine?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We're working on that, too.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm near a Mosque. I could hear
text: the call to prayer over the P.A.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Good. That means that we're in the
dialog: right area.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You're nearby?
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I spoke with soldiers from the
dialog: third ID who were escorting your
dialog: convoy.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: They're alive?
text: After a beat:
speaker_heading: DAN
text: Not all of them. Both Bradley
text: tanks were hit with IEDs. The rest
text: got caught in small arms fire.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What the hell happened out there,
dialog: Paul?
dialog: 
text: Paul doesn't answer at first.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Paul.
text: After a beat:
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We had just left Anaconda,
dialog: everything seemed okay. We knew
dialog: that a bunch of our CB radios had
dialog: been stolen and that the Iraqis
dialog: were listening in, so we made sure
dialog: to switch from our usual channels.
text: Pam was riding with Jeff Breer, the
dialog: convoy commander. She wanted to
dialog: ride with me like she usually did
text: when she hitched a ride from base,
dialog: but it seemed safer for her to be
text: with the C.C. As we headed down
dialog: the road, all these kids came
text: running into the street. Dozens of
dialog: them. It almost seemed like they
dialog: were expecting us, except we got
dialog: there faster than they thought we
text: would. So they run on up in front
text: of me, and I slam on my brakes.
dialog: The rest of the drivers were
text: already further up ahead, so they
dialog: kept going. Next thing I know, one
text: of the lead trucks got hit by an
text: IED. I hear Tommy Wilkes on the
dialog: radio saying, Sandman's hit,
dialog: Sandman's hit. He's...he's
dialog: everywhere.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: That's when the Iraqis came out of
text: their mud huts from the side of the
dialog: road and started shooting
dialog: everybody. I couldn't believe what
text: was happening. It seemed like slow-
text: motion, like I was watching it on
dialog: TV. People -- my friends -- were
dialog: getting killed, and all I could do
dialog: is watch. I didn't even notice
dialog: that the kids were throwing bricks
text: and rocks at me until one split my
dialog: windshield. Sort of snapped me out
dialog: of my trance. But then, I guess I
text: got hit in the head with a rock,
dialog: `cause I blacked out.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Do you happen to remem...mo...
dialog: nea...
text: The cell phone service begins to cut out. Suddenly, the
text: coffin begins to vibrate slightly, dropping sand granules
text: through the crack and onto the wood bottom, followed by the
text: faint sound of an explosion.
text: Within seconds, the explosions grow louder and more
text: proximate. The vibration becomes so intense that it
text: violently shakes Paul around the coffin.
text: The sound of jet plane engines are heard coming from above,
text: flying by as the massive explosions continue.
text: Sand seeps in through the crack between the top and sides of
text: the coffin as it shakes. Paul does his best to brace
text: himself, but the bombardment is far too powerful.
dialog: 
text: A large crack forms in the wooden cover to the coffin,
text: spanning almost its entire length. Sand immediately pours
text: through the concave shaped crack, seeping in onto Paul like
text: an hourglass.
text: Fearing that the top of the coffin may collapse under the
text: immense pressure from the sand above, Paul positions himself
text: underneath it and presses with all his might. He grunts and
text: screams loudly, using what little strength he has left to
dialog: keep the top from caving.
text: The shaking soon stops, though the steady flow of sand
dialog: continues.
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: In efforts to prevent the sand from filling the coffin any
text: faster, Paul removes the button-down shirt from the hole and
text: stuffs into the area where it enters with the greatest
text: volume. He removes the balled-up cloth from the other hole
text: and does the same with it. Both offer very little help.
text: The flashlight falls to the floor. The red light beam turns
text: off. Darkness. The sound of sand steadily pouring down.
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (EXHAUSTED)
dialog: Oh no...no...
text: Paul clicks the flashlight to a different setting. White
text: light shines, but then goes out. He shakes the flashlight
text: and it stays on, shining its normal white beam.
dialog: 
text: He assesses his situation, noticing that the coffin is
text: already filled with a small layer of sand; a situation that
dialog: is only going to get worse with time.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This can't be happening.
text: We see that Dan Brenner is no longer on the phone, and that
text: the display menu shows an icon of a phone with a line through
dialog: it -- No Service Available.
text: Once he feels it is secure enough, Paul slowly moves his body
text: away from the crack. Although slightly caved, it does not
text: show any more signs of possible collapse.
text: Sweat drenches his face. His eyes affixed, in utter
text: disbelief, on the sand as it spills into the coffin, filling
text: in around him inch-by-inch.
dialog: 
text: He grabs the cell phone, only to see that he does not have a
dialog: signal.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: No. Come on. Please work.
text: He shakes the cell phone and moves it all around the coffin,
text: hoping that it may somehow help. His efforts are futile.
text: The flashlight goes dead. He hits it, shakes it. It turns
text: back on. The brightness is diminished.
text: Still the sand continues to fall, drowning him deeper and
text: deeper in a pool of granules.
text: Then, very surprisingly, the cell phone rings. Paul answers
dialog: right away.
dialog: 65.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (FRANTICALLY)

speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. Yes, this is Paul. Who are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Paul, my name's Alan Davenport, I'm
dialog: the personnel director here at
text: Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I left you a message.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: You did. I also heard from Rebecca
text: Browning over at the State
dialog: Department. Are you able to speak
dialog: on the status of your situation?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's worse. There was an explosion
dialog: or something. The coffin's
text: breaking, there's sand pouring in
dialog: from everywhere. I only have a
dialog: half an hour before --
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Okay, okay. Slow down. You should
dialog: try to stay calm. Tell me
dialog: something, Paul, who have you
dialog: spoken to?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: The hostage takers, Dan Brenner
dialog: from the hostage working group --
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Okay, Paul. I'm with you. How
dialog: about the media. I know your
dialog: ransom video leaked, but have you
dialog: spoken directly to anyone about
dialog: what's going on?
text: The flashlight goes out. Paul hits it a few times and it
text: turns back on.
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: That's good. It needs to stay that
dialog: way. It's important that we keep
dialog: this situation as contained as
dialog: possible.
text: Paul finds Alan's obvious concern with doing damage control
dialog: to be infuriating.
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: About three inches to my right,
text: there's a wall. Three inches to my
text: left, there's another wall. And
text: about four inches above my head,
text: there's a roof that's about to
dialog: collapse and drown me in sand. I
dialog: think this situation is pretty
dialog: contained.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: I know you're upset --
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Help me! Help me! What are you
dialog: going to do to help me?!
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: I know you're upset. And, from
dialog: what I've been told, steps are
dialog: being taken to get you out of
dialog: there. So, hopefully it won't be
dialog: much longer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Thank God.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Yes, thank God.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm going to switch on a recorder
dialog: right now. Just a second...
text: Paul's visage expresses his confusion.
text: A click is heard in the b.g. of Alan's phone, followed by a
text: low, steady hum.
text: Alan's speech becomes very laconic. His questions are
text: clearly being read from a Human Resources handbook of some
dialog: kind.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Alan Davenport, Personnel
dialog: Director for Crestin, Roland and
dialog: Thomas, Incorporated. The date is
dialog: October 23, 2006. I am speaking
dialog: with Paul Conroy. Mister Conroy,
dialog: are you aware that I'm recording
dialog: this conversation?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What...?
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Please answer the question.
text: The flashlight goes out again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Shit.
text: Paul hits it, but it does not catch. He sits in darkness.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Mister Conroy?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. Yes!
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: And do I have your permission to do
dialog: so?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why do you need my permission?
dialog: What is all this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: I need you to answer yes or no,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. Alright? Yes!
text: Paul hits the flashlight. It turns back on.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Thank you. Now, Mister Conroy,
dialog: when were you hired by CRT?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: About nine months ago. Around
dialog: January of 2005. Why are you
dialog: wasting time with this?
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: I have your official date of hire
dialog: as January 4th, 2005. Is that
dialog: correct?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Who cares? This is fucking crazy --
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: January 4th, 2005. Is that
dialog: correct?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: And during your initial training,
dialog: before being sent to Iraq, were you
dialog: made aware of the dangers inherent
dialog: to the position for which you were
dialog: hired.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You mean when I came down there to
dialog: Dallas and you guys said that all
dialog: of the trucks would be armored and
dialog: have bulletproof glass?
text: The flashlight dims. Paul angrily shakes it, returning it to
text: full strength.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: You mean when you told us that
dialog: things were safer than ever over
dialog: here? Is that when I was made
dialog: aware?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: I need you to answer yes or no,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Yes.
text: The flashlight begins to slowly dim.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: During that time, did you also
dialog: receive and sign an employment
dialog: contract with CRT, which thoroughly
dialog: explained company policy as it
dialog: pertained to your specific terms of
dialog: employment?
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah, I signed a bunch of things.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Yes or no.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. I signed the contract. Yes!
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: It's our understanding that you
dialog: were taken hostage in Iraq two
dialog: hours ago, is that also correct?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. That's completely correct.
dialog: What is the point of all this?
dialog: 
text: Alan breaks from the H.R. handbook script, though his tone
text: remains just as matter-of-fact. The flashlight continues its
text: steady, slow dim.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Our legal department requires that
dialog: we obtain a sworn affidavit from
dialog: employees, confirming that they
dialog: understand the reasons for their
dialog: forced separation from the company.
dialog: As of this morning, your employment
dialog: with CRT was officially terminated.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wait, wait, wait --
text: The flashlight dims even more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: It was brought to our attention
dialog: that you were engaging in relations
dialog: with a fellow CRT employee --
dialog: Pamela Gorham.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. Wait --
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Stipulated in your contract was a
dialog: fraternization clause, in which it
dialog: was stated quite clearly that any
dialog: relationship, be it romantic or
dialog: sexual in nature, deemed
dialog: inappropriate by CRT senior
dialog: officials is grounds for immediate
dialog: termination.
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We...we were just friends.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Our records indicate differently.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This is bullshit.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: We're also legally required to
dialog: inform you that because you were
dialog: technically no longer under the
dialog: employ of CRT at the time of your
dialog: abduction, we cannot be held
dialog: accountable for any injury that may
dialog: befall upon you after your official
dialog: date and time of termination.
dialog: Therefore, in your case, that
dialog: includes this incident or any
dialog: consequences that may result from
dialog: it.
text: Paul sees where Alan is going with this. He's thunderstruck.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What about my insurance money? My
dialog: family will need that money...
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Given that you were alive up until
dialog: the time of your termination --
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You son of a bitch. You can't do
dialog: this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Do you understand everything --
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You can't do this!
text: Alan takes a second before trying again.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: Do you understand everything
dialog: you've been told, Mister Conroy?
text: Paul does not answer.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT (CONT'D)
dialog: Mister Conroy?
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: After a long beat:
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Go to hell.
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: That concludes our interview with
dialog: Paul Conroy. I am now turning off
text: the recorder.
text: A click is heard. The humming ceases.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You people can't just wash your
dialog: hands of this. You bastards put me
dialog: here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN DAVENPORT
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Alan ends the call.
text: Paul looks at the phone -- it is still holding a steady
text: signal. Battery life, however, is running quite low. All
text: that remains is one blinking bar, indicating that Paul has
dialog: very little battery life left.
text: He shakes his hand free of the pile of sand that now covers
text: it and looks at his watch. It's 8:31pm.
text: The flashlight bulb dims until it goes out completely. Only
text: the light of the cell phone display lights the coffin.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Come on...
dialog: 
text: Wasting little time, Paul dials Jabir. The phone rings and
text: rings, but Jabir does not answer. Checking to make sure the
dialog: he dialed the correct number, Paul matches it against the
text: phone number he wrote onto the wall of the coffin.
text: Seeing that he did, in fact, dial correctly, Paul again tries
text: to call Jabir. While he waits through the many rings, he
text: tries relighting the Zippo. Spark...spark...it catches.
text: No one answers. Paul's disquietude is evident in his
text: increasingly erratic behavior.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Answer the phone!!
text: Paul tries Jabir once again, but still he does not answer the
dialog: phone.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (desperate, exhausted)
dialog: Why won't you answer?!!
text: It's then that something occurs to Paul. He stares at the
text: crack in the top of the coffin and the sand that pours in at
text: an alarmingly fast rate.
text: The crack has split Jabir's written phone number in half.
text: The aerial bombing. He wonders how it may have affected
text: Jabir and, consequently, his own chances of survival. He
text: places his hand under the point from where the sand pours in
text: most, allowing it to collect on his palm and slip through his
dialog: fingers.
text: The flickering Zippo flame tells of the diminished amount of
dialog: oxygen.
text: Paul attempts to control his breathing, realizing full well
text: that there are not many more breaths he will be able to take.
text: He then calls Dan Brenner. After a few rings, Brenner
dialog: answers.
text: Paul is surprisingly serene.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Paul, is that you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: They're dead.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: How do you know that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I just do.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: Three F-16s levelled parts of the
dialog: city a few minutes ago.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I know. I felt it. Did they know
dialog: I was here?
text: The Zippo flame flutters. Weakens.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Did they care?
text: Dan does not answer.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: These people that took me -- if
dialog: they're dead, they can't tell you
dialog: where I am.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We can still try to track down your
dialog: signal.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You tried that already.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We can try again.
text: Paul appreciates Dan's effort, but he knows there is little
dialog: hope left for him.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's over, isn't it?
text: After a long beat:
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: No.
text: Paul doesn't say a word. He knows that Dan is lying. After
text: a beat, Dan comes clean.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: The flame of the Zippo becomes smaller. It clearly has
dialog: little life left.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What should I do?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's right -- just like everyone
dialog: else on the planet, there are some
dialog: things you know and some things you
dialog: don't.
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I wish this could have gone
dialog: differently.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah...me too.
text: After a long beat, Paul ends the call. He forces a smile to
text: his lachrymose face.
text: Utterly hopeless, he opens the phone and turns on the video
text: feature. He turns the phone to face himself, projecting his
text: image on the display.
text: He presses Record.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Paul Steven Conroy. Social
dialog: Security number 048-32-1198, date
dialog: of birth 3/19/68. This video will
dialog: serve as my last will and
dialog: testament. To my wife, Linda
dialog: Conroy, I leave the seven hundred
dialog: dollars in my personal savings and
dialog: whatever I have left in my annuity.
dialog: To my son, Shane Conroy, I...I
dialog: don't know. I don't have anything
dialog: else. My stuff, like, my clothes.
dialog: I wish I had more...I wish I had
dialog: done more. Your dad wasn't really
dialog: much of anything, Shane, I'm sorry.
dialog: Maybe if I was a famous baseball
text: player, or a guy who wore a suit to
dialog: work, I would have more to leave
dialog: you. But, you can be one of those
dialog: people if you want. You can be
dialog: whatever you want. Just promise me
dialog: that when you get older, you'll
dialog: take good care of your mom. And
dialog: promise me that you'll always try
dialog: to do the right thing, no matter
dialog: what. I love you very much, Shane.
dialog: Maybe I never said that
dialog: enough...maybe I did, I don't even
dialog: know. That probably means I
dialog: didn't.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm sorry, Linda. I should have
dialog: listened to you.
text: Paul ends the video and closes the phone. He carefully
text: places the phone into his pocket, where it may hopefully be
dialog: found if he ever is.
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He lays back, staring at the almost completely extinguished
text: Zippo flame, as the sand continues to rain on him.
text: Down and down it pours, the sands of time passing might and
text: main through the cracks.
text: The Zippo flame goes out. Paul sits in the darkness,
text: resigned to what apparently will be his fate.
text: Hold on black for several seconds...until --
text: -- suddenly, from inside Paul's pocket, he hears a faint
text: vibration. It's the cell phone. He looks at the number of
text: who is calling him. Shines the light of the cell phone on
text: the list of numbers written on the top of the coffin. He
text: can't believe what he's seeing.
dialog: 
text: Paul answers immediately.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You're not dead.
text: Jabir is heard speaking frantically in Arabic to the several
text: other people in the room with him.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello? Hello?!
text: Jabir turns his attention to Paul.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Where is money?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: What don't know?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't know where the money is.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Liar!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm not lying! I swear.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Swear?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm telling the truth.
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sounding panicked, Jabir again speaks in Arabic to the other
text: people in the room with him. They respond accordingly.
text: Paul tries to turn on the flashlight. It doesn't work.
text: Jabir returns his scornful attention to Paul.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: From Embassy, you get money now!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can't!
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You will!!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I need more time. Please.
text: Paul shakes and hits the flashlight. It still does not work.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: No more time!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: There's sand pouring in here. I
dialog: can't...it's everywhere. Please,
dialog: let me out of here and I will get
dialog: you the money.
text: Jabir utters something in Arabic to someone standing next to
text: him, seemingly asking a question and getting an answer from
dialog: the same individual.
text: Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight. Switches the
text: positioning of the batteries. Screws the cap back on. Hits
dialog: the switch.
dialog: Nothing.
text: Jabir returns to the phone.
speaker_heading: JABIR (CONT'D)
dialog: You show blood.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What?
text: Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight again. Removes the
text: batteries. Bites down on them a few times. Blows hard
text: inside the flashlight tube.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You show blood, they give money.
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You cut off thumb finger, send
dialog: video.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm not doing that.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Yes!
text: Paul puts the batteries back inside the flashlight. Begins
text: screwing on the cap.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's right, no. You let me out
dialog: of here, and I'll cut off my whole
dialog: God damn hand if you want.
text: Jabir again says something to someone in the room with him,
text: returning to Paul after a brief moment.
text: Paul finishes closing the top of the flashlight.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You have wife?
text: Click. The flashlight turns on!
dialog: 
text: Paul considers Jabir's question to be a potential sign of
dialog: compassion.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes, I do. And a son. A young
dialog: son. I want to go home...to see
dialog: them. Please, sir.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes. Sir. I say that out of
dialog: respect...to you.
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: 243 East Walnut Street. Hastings,
dialog: Michigan. U.S.A.
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (CONCERNED)
dialog: That's my...why did you say that?
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You show blood...or they show
dialog: blood.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's...you're lying. You're
dialog: nobody...all of you. You can't get
dialog: to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. You're peasants, criminals,
dialog: that's all. You don't even know
dialog: where Michigan is.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: Detroit. Ann Arbor.
text: Even this basic knowledge is enough to make Jabir's threats
dialog: that much more real.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You looked at a map. That's all
dialog: you did.
speaker_heading: JABIR
dialog: You show blood, or they show blood.
text: Send video by five minutes.
text: Jabir ends the call. Realizing that Jabir is gone, Paul
text: quickly dials his wife's cell phone.
text: After several rings, her voice mail picks up.
speaker_heading: LINDA (V.O.)
dialog: Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a
dialog: message. Thanks and have a great
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (FRANTICALLY)
dialog: Linda, listen to me: you and Shane
dialog: have to go somewhere... anywhere.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't stay at the house, whatever
dialog: you do, do not stay at the house.
dialog: The guy...the kidnapper, he knows
dialog: our address. He stole my license
dialog: and now he knows where we live. Go
dialog: to the Sheriff's station if you
dialog: have to, just don't go home.
text: Paul hangs up. He takes a moment to look around, noticing
text: that the coffin is almost halfway filled with sand.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: the sand)
dialog: Holy God.
text: Paul then dials Dan Brenner. After only one ring, the call
text: goes directly to voice mail.
dialog: 
text: The flashlight starts to dim. Paul shakes it, causing it to
dialog: regain its strength.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: This is Daniel Brenner. Please
text: leave a message at the tone.
text: The beep sounds. Paul delivers a frenzied message.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Brenner, where are you?! He's
dialog: alive! He just called me! Call me
dialog: right away! The fucking guy is
dialog: still alive!
text: Paul hangs up the phone.
text: Unsure what to do next, Paul's heartbeat races. He fidgets,
text: nervously shaking and tapping his thumb against the phone.
text: He questions the validity of Jabir's threats toward his
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
text: They can't find them.
dialog: They...can't. There's no way.
text: Paul opens the phone and brings up the photo of Pamela, bound
text: and gagged. The image causes Paul to second guess himself.
text: The flashlight goes out. The cell phone's display
text: illuminates Paul's face.
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He then replays the video in which Pamela is seen being shot.
text: Reliving the experience is extremely painful, though his
text: concern is more on his own family at this point. However,
text: the video is enough to convince Paul of Jabir and his
text: cohort's convictions.
text: Paul tries the Zippo. Nothing. Only sparks. He tosses it
dialog: aside.
text: His breathing grows erratic and labored. His eyes dart from
text: side-to-side, his throat groans involuntary noises of fear.
text: Paul then looks at the knife, and then at his watch. He has
text: less than two minutes to send the video to Jabir.
text: Fearing for the safety of his family, he must meet Jabir's
dialog: demands.
dialog: 
text: He hits the flashlight a few times. Click. It turns on.
text: Paul opens the phone and sets it to take video. He places it
text: flat onto the surface of the sand, which by this point is
text: already filling the coffin halfway. He then reaches for the
dialog: knife.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God. Oh my God.
text: He places his hands against the side of the coffin, spreading
text: his fingers. He stares intently at his thumb.
text: With the extremely sharp knife in hand, Paul slowly lowers it
text: just above his thumb. He inhales and exhales deep breaths,
text: almost hyperventilating.
speaker_heading: PAUL(CONT'D)
dialog: Holy shit.
text: Paul then reaches into the sand and finds one of the expired
text: glow sticks. He shakes the sand off of it and places it
text: across his mouth, biting into it hard.
text: His heart races, his breaths are the deepest he's ever taken.
text: After placing the flashlight on the ground, to ensure that
text: the camera picks up the image, he presses the record button
text: on the cell phone.
text: Grinding his teeth into the glow stick and letting out a
text: primordial scream, Paul closes his eyes and chops down with
text: the knife.
text: We see, through the display screen of the phone, Paul sever
text: his thumb with a swift chop of the blade.
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A small spray of blood spatters onto his face as he screams
text: out in unfathomable pain.
text: He falls to his side, still screaming and writhing. He
text: reaches for his discarded outer-shirt, which is still stuffed
text: in the crack to help slow the influx of sand. Removing the
text: shirt from the crack instantly causes the sand to fall into
text: the coffin more rapidly.
text: Paul wraps the shirt around his hand. The blood quickly soaks
text: right through it.
text: He is fading fast. His blood loss is great. Shock sets in.
text: He musters up the strength to send the video to Jabir.
text: To secure his shirt over the wound, Paul removes his belt
text: from his waist and pulls it tight over his wrap.
dialog: 
text: Growing increasingly more pale, Paul teeters on the verge of
text: consciousness. Everything becomes blurry to him.
text: The phone falls from his hand. He shivers. His lips turn a
text: light shade of purple and his face ash white. Everything
text: becomes more and more blurry. He fights with every last
text: ounce of strength to remain conscious.
text: While laying against the side of the coffin, the phone
text: vibrates once again. To Paul, the vibration against the wood
text: seems so distant, so foreign. The vibration grows louder and
text: louder in his mind, sounding more and more like the sound of
text: rotating helicopter blades.
text: He then hears what sounds like VOICES, yelling from on top of
text: the coffin.
speaker_heading: VOICE #1
dialog: He's down here!
speaker_heading: VOICE #2
dialog: Get him out! Keep digging!
speaker_heading: VOICE #3
dialog: Paul, we're here!
text: The cacophony of voices form a mosaic of sound in Paul's
text: head, each overlapping the other in distant echoes. Shovels,
text: digging deep into the ground, are heard banging against the
text: top of the coffin.
text: The top of the coffin is torn open, sending a brilliant ray
text: of white light onto Paul. He stares into the light, crying,
text: eking out a tortured smile.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Paul is back in the same predicament. The voices,
text: the shovels, the light -- it was all a hallucination, brought
text: upon by his loss of blood.
text: He's still alone. He's still in the coffin, which continues
text: to fill up with sand. He is too exhausted to display his
dialog: disappointment.
text: The phone continues to vibrate. It soon stops. Paul is in
text: too poor condition to show any concern.
text: After a beat, the phone begins vibrating once again. After
text: several rings, Paul languidly picks it up. He barely
text: recognizes the number through his extremely blurred vision.
text: He's so weak, he's barely able to formulate words. He spits
text: out stray particles of sand from his mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Paul, it's Brenner.
text: Paul doesn't have the strength to answer.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Paul? Are you there? Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm...here.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We're coming for you now. You hear
dialog: me? We know where you are.
dialog: 
text: This news serves as somewhat of an adrenaline rush for Paul,
text: who musters up even the modicum of strength he seemingly did
dialog: not have left in him.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You're coming?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We are, Paul. We're almost there
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: DAN
text: Coalition forces picked up a Shiite
text: insurgent just outside of Baghdad.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Said he knew where an American was
dialog: buried alive. He agreed to show us
dialog: where if we let him go.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You're coming for me?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We're practically there already.
text: An impossible smile fights its way to Paul's lips. His
text: momentary joy is just that, however, for the sand has almost
text: completely filled the coffin by this point.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You have to hurry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We are.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No...you have to hurry. The
text: sand...it's filling up fast.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Just hang in there for three more
dialog: minutes. This will all be over
dialog: soon, I promise.
text: Paul is very hopeful that Dan is correct in his assumption.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Okay. I believe you. Thank you.
dialog: Thank you.
text: A beep is heard. Paul has another call coming in. He's
text: visibly elated upon seeing who it is.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Three minutes. Try to --
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I have to go!
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Paul, no --
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Call me right back.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Paul!
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Call me right back.
text: Paul switches to the other call, despite the fact that he has
text: a mere eight inches left before the entire coffin is filled
text: with sand from top-to-bottom.
text: He holds the flashlight just above the top of the sand pile,
text: allowing it to illuminate what little unoccupied area
dialog: remains.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Linda.
text: Linda is in hysterics, which is evident in her speech.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Paul? Paul is that you? Tell me
dialog: it's you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's me, sweetie.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Oh my God, Paul! What are they
dialog: doing to you? Please tell me
dialog: you're okay.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm...okay.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I just saw the news. What...oh my
dialog: God, baby.
text: The flashlight dims. Paul shakes it, regaining a bit of its
dialog: strength.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's going to be okay now.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I missed all your calls. I left my
dialog: cell phone at home. I just found
dialog: out what was going on.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's okay. It's all okay.
dialog: They're getting me out.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Who?
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The people. Americans. They found
dialog: out where I am and they're on their
dialog: way to get me.
speaker_heading: LINDA
speaker_heading: (ELATED)
dialog: They are? Oh thank God. Oh dear
dialog: God, thank you.
text: The flashlight flickers. Paul hits it. It flickers some
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's all going to be okay.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: How do you know for sure? Oh God,
dialog: please tell me you're okay.
text: The flashlight continues to flicker almost like a
text: stroboscopic light from this point forward.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm okay.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I was so afraid I was going to lose
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You're not.
text: Linda breaks down in joyous tears.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I love you so much. I love you so,
dialog: so much.
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (WELLING UP)
dialog: I love you, too.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm sorry. I should have listened
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: It doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I should have never come here. You
dialog: were right. I'm sorry.
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sweetie, I don't care. I just want
dialog: you home. Please come home to me.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Swear it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I will. I swear I will.
text: Paul then receives a call on the other line. He checks to
text: see who's calling. It's Dan Brenner.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: They're here!
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: The people?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: They're calling me right now. I
dialog: have to go.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Call me right away.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I will. I love you.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I love you. Swear it again.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I swear. I have to go.
text: Paul clicks over to the other line, where Dan Brenner waits
dialog: to speak with him.
text: We hear Dan yelling to people who are with him. A great deal
text: of commotion and action is heard through the phone.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Move! Move! Let's go.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Brenner?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Paul? Paul?
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's me.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We're here!
text: Dan yells to one of the soldiers who are with him.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Corporal, get your men over here!
text: Dan gets back on the phone with Paul
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: He brought us right to you.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the soldiers)
dialog: Start digging! Let's go, let's go!
text: The flashlight fades. Paul hits it, momentarily returning it
text: to full strength.
text: Meanwhile, the sand inside the coffin has almost reached the
text: very top. It continues to pour in from the crack, seemingly
text: faster than ever.
text: Paul struggles to keep his head above the sand, giving him
text: only a few inches between his face and the top of the coffin.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You have to hurry. It's almost
dialog: full.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Just hang in there!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hurry! Please!
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (to the soldiers)
dialog: Dig! Dig! Dig!
text: Paul fights to keep his head above the sand. The flashlight
dialog: dims.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can't...are you close?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We're almost there, Paul. We're
dialog: almost there!
dialog: (to the soldiers)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Faster!
speaker_heading: (TO PAUL)
dialog: We're almost there. We're right
