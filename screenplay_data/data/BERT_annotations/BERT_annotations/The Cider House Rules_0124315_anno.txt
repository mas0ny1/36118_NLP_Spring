scene_heading: EXT. ST CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - DAWN
text: An establishing shot of the rundown train station on an
text: overcast morning. There's snow on the station platform. A
text: train arrives and departs.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: In other parts of the world, young
dialog: men of promise leave home to make
dialog: their fortunes, battle evil, or solve
dialog: the problems of the world.
text: Behind the station, at the top of the hill, lies the St.
dialog: Cloud's orphanage.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: I was myself such a young man, when
dialog: I came to save the orphanage in St.
dialog: Cloud's... many years ago.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING
text: A man and woman (COUPLE #1) make their way toward the main
text: entrance of the large brick building.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: Here in St. Cloud's, I have come to
dialog: understand that promises are rarely
dialog: kept, that the battle isn't so much
dialog: against evil as ignorance, and that
dialog: being successful can't hold a candle
dialog: to being of *use*.
text: The couple enters the orphanage, where we hear the sound of
dialog: babies.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: Nor have I solved the problem I came
dialog: here to solve.
scene_heading: INT. ORPHANAGE - MORNING
text: Two nurses, EDNA and ANGELA, chase CHILDREN--a morning
dialog: routine.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: Even in the most enlightened times,
dialog: unwanted babies will manage to be
dialog: born. That there will always be
dialog: orphans is simple not a problem to
dialog: be solved. Here is St. Cloud's, we
dialog: don't regard the sordid facts of
dialog: life as problems.
text: The camera goes up the stairs with some of the kids.
scene_heading: INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY
text: We enter an office where DR. LARCH shows couple #1 their
text: newly adopted son, HOMER, an infant who lies smiling in Dr.
text: Larch's arms.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: In truth, we've only had one real
dialog: problem.
text: We close in on the infant until his face fills the screen.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: His name was Homer Wells.
text: Dr. Larch hands over the infant to the adopting parents.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I named him after the Greek writer.
dialog: You know Homer, of course?
text: Hesitant nods. (They don't look as if they read.)
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I made his name "Wells" because I
dialog: could tell he was very deep.
text: The parents look with pride at their adopted son.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: In truth, Nurse Angela named him--
dialog: her father *drilled* wells, and
dialog: "Homer" was one of her family's
dialog: umpteen cats.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY
text: At the front door, Larch and the nurses wave and call good-
text: bye to Homer, they close the door.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
text: The same door swings open; it's another night. The same couple
text: is bringing Homer back. There is concern in their faces as
text: Nurse Edna lets them in.
scene_heading: INT. BOY'S DIVISION, DOORWAY - NIGHT
text: Larch is delivering his benediction to the boys.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: "Good night, you Princes of Maine,
dialog: you Kings of New England!"
text: As he turns, he is startled by Nurse Edna, waiting with couple
dialog: #1 and baby Homer.
scene_heading: ADOPTING MOTHER
dialog: There's something wrong with him! He
dialog: never makes a sound.
text: Larch looks quickly at Homer.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: He didn't cry enough for them, if
dialog: you can believe it.
scene_heading: ADOPTING FATHER
dialog: Do you think we could have a look at
dialog: someone a little different?
text: The mother hands over the baby to Larch. Baby Homer lets out
text: a happy squeal as soon as he's in Larch's arms. The parents
text: stare in disbelief.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: Thus was Homer Wells returned. He
dialog: was too happy a baby.
scene_heading: EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY
text: Angela and Edna call and wave good-bye to a two-year-old
text: Homer, leaving with COUPLE #2. Larch stands on the porch and
text: watches the family head down the hill.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: The second family has an unfortunate
dialog: gift for getting sounds out of Homer.
scene_heading: INT. COUPLE #2'S HOME - DAY
text: Larch bursts into the home of the second couple and lifts a
text: crying and bruised Homer out of his bed. There is rage in
text: Larch's eyes as he looks at the couple.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: The rumor was true. They beat him.
text: He couldn't stop crying.
scene_heading: EXT. HILL, ST. CLOUD'S - DAY
text: Larch carries Homer up the orphanage hill.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: Here is St. Cloud's, I try to
dialog: consider, with each rule I make or
dialog: break, that my first priority is an
dialog: orphan's future.
scene_heading: INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
text: The naked belly of a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: Easier said than done.
text: A tiny hand comes in with a stethoscope and puts it on the
text: big belly. Young Homer's head, with the stethoscope around
text: his neck, pops up behind the belly; he closes his eyes as he
text: concentrates on listening to the sounds of the unborn child.
text: Larch stops in the doorway, catching sight of Homer. He smiles
dialog: faintly.
scene_heading: EXT. COUPLE #3'S HOME - DAY
text: The door opens to a THIRD COUPLE smiling at us, welcoming
text: and embracing a sixteen-year-old Homer. Behind them waits
text: the would-be STEPSISTER--an attractive girl, a little older
text: then Homer.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: I told the third family to take good
dialog: care--this was a special boy.
scene_heading: INT. STEPSISTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Homer and the stepsister are in bed together. The parents
text: burst in on them--the father chasing Homer around and around
text: the bed, the mother beating her daughter, who covers herself
text: with a pillow.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: It was Homer who took too much good
dialog: care of himself.
scene_heading: EXT. COUPLE #3'S HOME - NIGHT
text: From her window, the stepsister watches Homer leave the house
text: carrying his suitcase. Homer looks up at her as he walks to
dialog: the street.
scene_heading: EXT. ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING
text: It's after dawn, but still a little dark, as Homer walks to
text: the orphanage door, suitcase in hand. A HUGELY PREGNANT WOMAN
text: arrives at the same time. They stand awkwardly next to each
text: other, waiting for someone to answer the door. The woman is
text: crying. Homer reaches out and takes her hand.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Don't be frightened. Everyone is
dialog: nice here.
speaker_heading: PREGNANT WOMAN
dialog: Do you live here?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I just belong here.
text: The woman sniffles; she nods vaguely. The door opens. Nurse
text: Edna lets the woman in and embraces Homer.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: What could I do with him? He kept
dialog: coming back!
scene_heading: INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Larch instructs an older Homer from "Gray's Anatomy." Homer
text: is bored and looks out the window.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Homer, if you're going to stay at
dialog: St. Cloud's, I expect you to be of
dialog: use.
scene_heading: INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
text: Homer looks adoringly at Dr. Larch as Larch examines ANOTHER
text: PREGNANT WOMAN. Larch waves Homer over; he places the boy's
text: hand on the woman's abdomen, to feel the fetus kicking.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: But, in failing to withhold love,
dialog: had I created a true and everlasting
dialog: orphan? I had been too successful
dialog: with Homer Wells. I had managed to
dialog: make the orphanage his *home*.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
text: Larch closes a door quickly behind him (so that Homer doesn't
scene_heading: see the ABORTION PATIENT in the O.R.)
scene_heading: INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
text: Homer assists Larch in delivering a BABY.
scene_heading: EXT. INCINERATOR - DAY
text: Homer carries a white enamel pail to the incinerator. He
text: looks inside the pail; he stops.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: God forgive me. I have *made* an
text: orphan by loving him too much. Homer
dialog: Wells will belong to St. Cloud's,
dialog: forever.
text: Hold on Homer's disgusted expression as he stares at the
text: contents of the pail.
text: END TITLE SEQUENCE. FADE OUT. We hear a song playing on an
text: old phonograph.
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - DAY
text: We see the song playing on the old phonograph. Dr. Larch is
text: taking ether. He holds the bottle in one hand, the cone over
text: his mouth and nose with the other.
scene_heading: SUPER: ST. CLOUD'S, MAINE, MARCH 1943.
text: When Larch dozes off, his hand loosens its grip on the cone;
text: the cone falls off his face, and he wakes up. Then he puts
text: the cone back in place, dripping more ether from the bottle
text: to the gauze covering the cone.
text: Pan the dispensary, which also serves as Larch's photo gallery
text: and bedroom apartment. The ether-bed is separated from the
text: room by a hospital curtain (the kind on casters). We see the
text: recording revolving, the glass-encased cabinets of medical
text: supplies, the old photographs of St. Cloud's.
text: Homer enters, he stands uncomfortably, watching Larch for a
text: moment. Then he turns around and walks back into the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Homer calls out as though he's just coming down the corridor.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Dr. Larch! Dr. Larch!
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - DAY
text: Larch wakes up; he shakes off the ether haze. Homer reenters.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: We've got two new patients, one to
dialog: deliver.
text: Dr. Larch and Homer leave together.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: The *two* doctors walk briskly down the hall, a couple of
dialog: professionals.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: First pregnancy?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Yes, for both.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: I presume you'd prefer handling the
dialog: delivery.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (tiredly; an old topic)
dialog: All I said was, I don't want to
dialog: perform abortions. I have no argument
dialog: with *you* performing them.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: You know *how* to help these women--
dialog: how can you not feel *obligated* to
dialog: help them when they can't get help
dialog: anywhere else?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask
dialog: how to do it--you just showed me.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: What *else* could I have showed you,
dialog: Homer? The only thing I can teach
dialog: you is what I know! In every life,
dialog: you've got to be of use.
text: Homer and Larch split off and disappear into two different
text: operating rooms. As he goes, Homer mumbles to himself, "Of
dialog: use, of use, of use."
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
text: Larch and Angela are preparing the ether for DOROTHY, a not
text: visibly pregnant woman. The sounds of labor across the hall
text: can be heard Over.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (holds the cone)
dialog: Have you ever had ether, Dorothy?
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Once, when they took out my appendix.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (looks for scar)
dialog: No one's touched your appendix.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Whatever it was... the ether made me
dialog: sick.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: It won't make you sick this time,
dialog: Dorothy--not the way I do it, just a
dialog: drop at a time.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I can't pay for this, you know--I
dialog: got no money.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: One day, Dorothy, if you have any
dialog: money, a donation to the orphanage
dialog: would be very much appreciated.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Only if you can afford it.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (holds the ether bottle)
dialog: Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
text: Angela puts the cone over Dorothy's mouth and nose; Larch
text: drips the ether on the cone. A newborn wails in the other
dialog: O.R. Over.
scene_heading: INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
text: Homer has delivered CARLA. A newborn baby is screaming in
text: Edna's arms. Homer is attending to Carla, who is panting.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: That was good, Carla--that was
dialog: *perfect*. Everything's fine.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I don't wanna see it!
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You don't have to see it, dear. Don't
dialog: worry.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I don't even wanna know what sex it
dialog: is--don't tell me!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: We won't tell you, Carla. You're
dialog: going to be okay.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Your *baby's* going to be okay, too.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I don't wanna know!
text: Larch pops into the delivery room; he peers at the baby.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: He's a big boy!
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Let me see him, for Christ's sake--I
dialog: wanna see him.
text: Edna shows the baby to Carla, who stares, then turns away.
text: Larch whispers to Homer.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Would you mind having a look at
dialog: Dorothy?
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
text: Angela sits with the still-etherized Dorothy while Larch and
text: Homer confer over a basin containing Dorothy's uterus.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: There was no visible wound?
speaker_heading: LARCH
text: No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus
dialog: was virtually *disintegrating*--my
text: stitches pulled right through the
dialog: tissue!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (mystified)
text: It looks like scurvy.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (derisively sarcastic)
dialog: Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old-
dialog: time sailor, suffering long periods
dialog: at sea with no fresh fruits or
dialog: vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a
dialog: *sailor*!
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: She's a prostitute, isn't she?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (to Angela)
dialog: Did you look in her purse?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: I looked everywhere else!
text: Angela hands Larch a bottle of brown liquid.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: It's called French Lunar Solution.
text: Larch wrinkles his nose at the odor.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: It's not ergot, it's not pituitary
dialog: extract, it's not oil of rue...
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: It claims to restore monthly
dialog: regularity.
speaker_heading: HOMER
text: It's obviously an aborticide.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Obviously.
text: Larch wets his finger with the stuff, then touches it to his
dialog: tongue.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (spits)
dialog: Christ, it's oil of tansy!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I don't know it.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: If you take enough of it, your
dialog: intestines lose their ability to
dialog: absorb Vitamin C.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: In other words, scurvy.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Good boy. Good job. And you call
dialog: yourself "not a doctor"!
dialog: (to Angela)
dialog: Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
text: As Homer turns to leave, Larch stops him; he points to the
dialog: basin.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Take care of that, will you?
text: Homer stops, annoyed; he picks up the basin and empties the
text: contents into a white enamel pail.
scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL - AFTERNOON
text: MISS TITCOMB is teaching math to some distracted boys and
text: girls in a corner of the dining room. A blackboard on wheels
text: is a mass of numbers. Homer, passing through the dining room
text: with the white enamel pail, attracts the attention of BUSTER,
text: a sixteen-year-old who is picking over a plate of pastries
text: on a table. Buster immediately goes with Homer.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: I'll help you.
text: Homer shakes his head, keeps walking. Buster follows. Dr.
text: Larch passes close to Buster. Buster makes a face, disgusted.
scene_heading: EXT. INCINERATOR - AFTERNOON
text: Buster and Homer tramp through the snow toward the
text: incinerator. Homer still carries the pail.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen
dialog: him do it!
speaker_heading: HOMER
text: It's because he's too tired to sleep.
dialog: He has to.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: He *smells* like he could put you to
dialog: sleep!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell
dialog: like ether.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: *You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't
text: smell like ether.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been
dialog: to medical school--I haven't even
dialog: been to high school!
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: But you've studied with the old man
dialog: for *years*!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I'm *not* a doctor!
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: I'm sorry, Homer.
text: Buster stands watching as Homer empties the pail into the
text: incinerator.
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT
text: With his head inclined to the giant ear of Larch's phonograph,
text: FUZZY--six, thin, and pale and looking remarkably like an
text: embryo--is listening to a recording. He can't hear what Larch
text: and Homer are saying about him as they construct a humidified
text: tent over a small hospital bed on wheels. The humidifier is
text: operated by a car battery.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you,
dialog: there's something about the premature
dialog: babies of alcoholic mothers. They
dialog: seem susceptible to every damn thing
dialog: that comes along.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I haven't read that.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I haven't, either. But you *will*.
dialog: The morons who write the books should
dialog: do a little research *here*.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: But isn't Fuzzy just... well,
dialog: underdeveloped?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I
dialog: wouldn't call his bronchial infections
dialog: "underdeveloped." Would you?
text: Larch plucks Fuzzy from in front of the phonograph and zips
text: him into the breathing tent. Fuzzy smiles. As larch leaves,
text: MARY AGNES, a pretty but tough-looking teenager, comes into
dialog: the dispensary.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: What is it, Mary Agnes?
text: Mary Agnes smiles at Homer; then she sticks her tongue out
text: at him. Homer looks at her impassively, but as the moment
text: continues his expression suggests his annoyance. Fuzzy starts
text: to cough; he wheezes as he breathes. Homer leans down; he
text: peers at Fuzzy through a hole by the zipper of the tent.
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: (garbled because of
dialog: her tongue)
dialog: Look!
text: Homer examines Mary Agnes' tongue.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Did you bite it?
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: I don't remember.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (dismissively)
dialog: It looks like you bit it--it'll be
dialog: all right.
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: Maybe I was kissing someone and he
dialog: bit me.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (looks at her tongue
dialog: again)
dialog: No, you did it yourself. Maybe in
dialog: your sleep.
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: I must have been *dreaming* of kissing
dialog: someone.
text: Homer is not responding to her come-on. He wheels Fuzzy into
dialog: the hall.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Story time, Fuzzy!
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT
text: In the girls' bunk room, Nurse Edna is saying prayers. The
text: girls lie with their palms pressed together on their chests.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: "Oh Lord, support us all the day
dialog: long..."
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - THE HILL - NIGHT
text: The building of St. Cloud's is silhouetted against the sky.
text: Carla, the woman we saw deliver the baby, is heading down
text: the hill alone, she sobs, not looking back.
speaker_heading: EDNA (O.S.)
dialog: "...until the shadows lengthen and
text: the evening comes, and the busy world
text: is hushed, and the fever of life is
dialog: over, and our work is done."
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT
text: In the bunk room again, with Edna and the girls.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: "Then in Thy mercy grant us save
dialog: lodging, and holy rest, and peace at
dialog: the last."
speaker_heading: ALL THE GIRLS
dialog: Amen! Amen! Amen!
scene_heading: INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT
text: Dr. Larch is reading from Oliver Twist--the death scene of
text: Bill Sike's dog. The boys listen in horror in their beds.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: "A dog, which had lain concealed
dialog: till now, ran backwards and forwards
text: on the parapet with a dismal howl,
dialog: and collecting himself for a spring,
text: jumped for the dead man's shoulders."
text: Homer enters; he walks quietly to his bed in the far corner
text: of the room, where he starts to undress.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: "Missing his aim, he fell into a
text: ditch, turning completely over as he
dialog: went; and striking his head against
text: a stone, dashed his brains out.
text: Larch turns out the lights. From the open doorway to the
text: hall, Larch delivers his nightly benediction.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Good night, you Princes of Maine!
dialog: You Kings of New England!
text: Larch closes the door, leaving them in the semi-darkness.
text: One young boy runs into Homer's bed, nervously giggling.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: (in his breathing
dialog: tent)
dialog: Why does Dr. Larch *do* tht every
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (about seven)
dialog: Maybe to scare us...
speaker_heading: COPPERFIELD
dialog: (about eleven)
dialog: No, you jerk.
speaker_heading: STEERFORTH
dialog: (about nine)
dialog: Dr. Larch *loves* us!
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: But why does he do *that*?
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: He does it because we like it.
text: The boys silently agree, Homer among them.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - EARLY MORNING
text: The girls, led by Mary Agnes, round a corner of the orphanage,
text: towing a sled piled high with snowballs.
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: Buster is mine. You two get
text: Copperfield and Curly. Nobody touches
dialog: Fuzzy.
text: They shriek as the boys suddenly surprise them. Buster throws
text: two hard snowballs that hit Mary Agnes and CLARA (eight or
text: nine) before Mary Agnes overwhelms him and repeatedly sticks
text: his head in the snow. Copperfield, terrified of Mary Agnes,
text: escapes. Curly misses, then tips over the sled of snowballs
text: as Clara and the adorable HAZEL (five or six) throw him to
text: the ground. Fuzzy drops his one snowball; he runs aimlessly
text: in circles, coughing, as Nurse Edna explodes from a door of
dialog: the orphanage.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Stop it! No fighting! *Share* the
dialog: snowballs!
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: (mouth full of snow)
dialog: They're *our* snowballs! They *stole*
dialog: them!
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: They attacked us--just like the Japs!
text: Fuzzy coughs and wheezes, trying to catch his breath.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Listen to you, Fuzzy! You've been
dialog: running. You get to the shower!
text: A NEW COUPLE comes up the hill. The orphans stop and stare,
text: brushing snow off themselves, struggling to make themselves
text: look presentable. Curly is desperate to look his best. Mary
text: Agnes doesn't bother to pretty herself. She whispers to Clara
dialog: and Hazel.
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: I know the type--they'll take one of
dialog: the babies.
scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL - MORNING
text: The children are eating breakfast as the would-be parents
text: walk around the tables, looking over the assembled orphans.
text: Curly works on his table manners; he forks and eats a piece
text: of pancake with elegance. Angela and Edna try to make the
text: couple slow down by the older children, but the couple stop
text: and stare at the adorable Hazel.
scene_heading: INT. BABY ROOM - MORNING
text: Larch and Homer are examining the babies. The doctors are
text: checking the babies' grips, their eyes, ears, and throats.
text: Angela appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
text: Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting
dialog: in your office.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (irritated)
text: Life is waiting.
text: Angela disappears. Larch looks at the next baby's record
text: (attached to the bed).
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Where's the name sheet?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Nobody's named this one yet.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: It's my turn!
text: Homer is tired of this game. Larch touches the child's
text: forehead with his index finger.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Henceforth you shall be... Little
dialog: Dorrit!
text: The baby starts to cry.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: He doesn't like it.
dialog: (looks at the record)
dialog: He's a boy, That's why.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: You do it then.
text: Homer points his finger at the child's forehead like a gun.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Henceforth you shall be... Little
dialog: Wilbur.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
text: Homer is writing the name.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: We haven't had a Wilbur here in a
dialog: year or so, have we? We used to have
dialog: *dozens*!
text: They are interrupted by Copperfield, who comes running from
dialog: the corridor.
speaker_heading: COPPERFIELD
dialog: They picked Hazel! The idiots chose
dialog: Hazel!
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - DAY
text: Hazel is being fussed over by Edna. Hazel clutches a cardboard
text: suitcase and a tattered rag doll. Mary Agnes, by far the
text: oldest, sits on a bed.
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: If people want to adopt one of us,
dialog: they should have to take the oldest
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Please, Mary Agnes! This is Hazel's
dialog: special day--don't make her feel
dialog: sad.
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: Hazel's practically the youngest of
dialog: us. She should be the *last* to leave!
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: At least Hazel can talk. Usually
dialog: they take one of the stupid babies.
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: They take the babies so they won't
dialog: ever have to tell them that they
dialog: were orphans!
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (begins to cry)
dialog: I'm not a baby!
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: If you cry, Hazel, they'll just send
dialog: you back.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Mary Agnes, that's not true!
text: Hazel cries harder.
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: That's what they did to me!
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You *wanted* to come back--that's
dialog: why you cried.
dialog: (to Hazel)
dialog: You can cry if you feel like it,
dialog: Hazel. You cry as much as you want.
scene_heading: INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Homer is in the corridor outside the office, overhearing
text: Larch's lecture to the couple adopting Hazel.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: It is strictly for our orphans' sake
dialog: that I destroy any record of their
dialog: natural mothers. Of course they will,
dialog: one day, want to know. But orphans,
dialog: especially, should look forward to
dialog: their *futures*. Not back to their
dialog: pasts.
scene_heading: INT. WINDOW, CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Homer sees Curly standing all alone by a window in the
text: corridor; a suitcase is next to him.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Hi, Curly. You going somewhere?
text: Curly shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I thought they might take me.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: They wanted a girl.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Nobody ever wants me!
text: Homer embraces Curly and lifts him up, he grabs the suitcase
text: and continues down the corridor.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You're one of the best, Curly--we
dialog: couldn't let just anyone take you.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone
dialog: take *any* of us!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: That's true.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Nobody's asked for me, have they?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Nobody special enough, Curly.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: You mean somebody asked?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Only the right people can have you,
dialog: Curly.
text: Homer disappears into the boys' bunk room carrying Curly and
text: his suitcase, leaving the corridor empty.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY
text: Faces in the windows; the orphans watch Hazel walking across
text: the snowy lawn with her new parents.
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT
text: Edna (with the girls) gives her good-bye blessing to Hazel.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Let us be happy for Hazel. Hazel has
dialog: found a family. Good night, Hazel.
speaker_heading: THE GIRLS
dialog: Good night, Hazel! Good night, Hazel!
dialog: Good night, Hazel!
scene_heading: INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY
text: The front door opens. The orphans excitedly run outside onto
text: the green lawn, into the warm weather of spring.
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - MORNING
text: Angela is singing along with the song on the phonograph, a
text: more romantic song then before, which rouses Larch from his
text: ether. He is grumpy, but she sings the song in his ear and
text: won't give him back the ether cone; he rolls away from her,
text: but she tickles him and bites his ear, coaxing him into a
text: more playful mood.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I was dreaming about you. How
dialog: beautiful you were!
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: You weren't dreaming about me.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I was!
text: Playfully, she slips out of his embrace.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Then I wasn't beautiful.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: It was just the ether, Wilbur...
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Homer wheels a tray with glasses of water between the beds.
text: A DISTRAUGHT PREGNANT WOMAN stops him by her bed.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Are you okay? Can I get you anything?
speaker_heading: DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
dialog: No one but me ever put a hand on me,
dialog: to feel that baby. Don't you want to
dialog: touch it or put your ear down to it?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Okay.
text: Homer touches the woman's belly.
speaker_heading: DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
dialog: Put your ear there. Go on.
text: Homer cautiously lays his ear against her belly.
speaker_heading: DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
dialog: You shouldn't have a baby if there's
dialog: no one who wants to put his face
dialog: right there!
text: She holds Homer's head against her belly; she presses his
text: face into her. She shuts her eyes. Homer's eyes stare widely.
text: Dr. Larch stops in the doorway; he watches with concern.
speaker_heading: DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
dialog: Stay right there. Right where you
dialog: are. Stay right here. Right here.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - DAY
text: Homer at the train station, staring down the empty tracks.
text: Buster is hanging around with him, kicking a rock.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: Do you ever think about leaving this
dialog: place to go find them?
text: Homer makes no response. As the train approaches, Homer and
text: Buster go sit on a loading cart. They see the distraught
text: woman (no longer pregnant) from Homer's experience of a few
text: nights ago; she is leaving St. Cloud's without her baby,
text: waiting for the approaching train. Her face is a mask. The
text: DISAPPROVING STATIONMASTER gives her a hard look.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: I mean your parents.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I know who you mean. I think about
dialog: leaving here, but not to find *them*.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Whoever they were, they didn't *do*
dialog: any of the things parents are supposed
dialog: to do. Dr. Larch did those things,
text: and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could
dialog: meet mine, anyway.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: What for, Buster? What would you do
dialog: if you met them?
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: Uh... I'd like to show them that I
dialog: can cook, a little.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You cook very well!
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: And that I can drive a truck!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Better than I can!
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: Sometimes I want to meet them so I
dialog: can kill them. Just sometimes.
text: Buster is ashamed; he knows he's said the wrong thing.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: Homer, you know I would never kill
dialog: anyone--you know I wouldn't.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I know.
text: The slowly moving train has stopped. There are SOLDIERS
text: leaning out the windows. Buster turns to see Mary Agnes
text: walking past the train--she's doing her best to look grown-
text: up, sophisticated. One of the soldiers reaches out and gently
text: tugs on her hair. Mary Agnes is enraged; she spits at the
dialog: soldier.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I doubt it. She's just an...
text: Mary Agnes spits at *all* the soldiers.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: ...emotional girl.
text: The soldiers roll up the windows as Mary Agnes improvises
text: some verbal abuse.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: What's she so emotional about?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I don't know. She got left here,
dialog: like the rest of us, didn't she?
text: Camera closes on Homer.
scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT
text: The orphans are watching King Kong, the part when the giant
text: ape first captures the screaming Fay Wray. Intercut Kong
text: with the orphans' rapt faces. Homer sits near the front,
text: mesmerized by the film. Dr. Larch and Angela sit by the
text: projector; Larch is reading a letter. Fuzzy points to the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: (coughing)
dialog: He thinks she's his *mother*!
text: King Kong is undressing Fay Wray in the cave.
speaker_heading: COPPERFIELD
dialog: He doesn't think she's his mother,
dialog: Fuzzy.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: He does so! He *loves* her!
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: How could she be his *mother*?
text: Larch shakes the letter in front of Angela.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (a harsh whisper)
dialog: They want to replace me! The Board
dialog: of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (whispering back)
dialog: They just want you to hire some new
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Some new *things* would be useful. I
dialog: don't need any "new help."
text: The film breaks--to huge cries of disappointment from the
text: orphans. Fuzzy coughs and coughs while Larch fumbles with
text: the projector. Angela turns on the light while Larch squints
text: at the broken film. The orphans are chanting, "Kong! Kong!"
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Homer! I need you!
text: Homer gets up and walks to the projector.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I thought you took care of this. It
text: always breaks in the same place.
dialog: It's your splice, isn't it?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (angry)
dialog: It's *your* splice! You blame me for
dialog: everything!
text: Larch abruptly lets go of the film.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Angela, we need a new movie, a new
dialog: projector, a new typewriter--*that's*
dialog: what they should replace around here!
text: Edna comes in; she speaks to Larch, then quickly leaves.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: We have a delivery. Imminent, in my
dialog: estimation...
text: Larch turns to Homer.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Homer, would you get this one?
text: Homer shifts his weight to the other foot; aggravated; he
text: stands there.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: She's a patient, right? She should
dialog: see a doctor.
text: Homer and Larch stare at each other.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (trying to stay calm)
dialog: Homer, you are a skilled and gifted
dialog: surgeon. You have near-prefect
dialog: obstetrical and gynecological
dialog: procedure.
text: Homer is also trying to avoid a fight.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I just mean I'd rather fix the movie.
dialog: Tonight.
text: Larch can't hide his disappointment.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Sure. Okay. You splice. I'll deliver.
text: It is an uneasy peace.
scene_heading: INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT (LATER)
text: Homer is adjusting Fuzzy's breathing tent as the other boys
text: climb into bed.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: Homer... doesn't King Kong think the
dialog: woman is his *mother*?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks,
dialog: all right.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: That's why Kong loves her!
text: Larch comes in and walks over to Homer and Fuzzy. Larch and
text: Homer exchange a look.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I thought it was my turn.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
text: Homer sits down with 'David Copperfield.' There is quiet
text: anticipation while Homer readies himself to read.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Whether I shall turn out to be the
dialog: hero of my own life, or whether that
dialog: station will be held by anybody else,
dialog: these pages must show."
text: Larch continues to adjust Fuzzy's breathing tent.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: "I was a posthumous child. My father's
text: eyes had closed upon the light of
dialog: this world six months, when mine
dialog: opened on it."
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: (whispers to Larch)
dialog: His father's dead, right?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (whispering back)
dialog: That's right, Fuzz.
text: Close on Fuzzy.
speaker_heading: HOMER (O.S.)
dialog: (continues reading)
dialog: "There is something strange to me,
text: even now, in the reflection that he
dialog: never saw me..."
text: As Larch bends over Fuzzy to fix the breathing apparatus,
text: Fuzzy whispers.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: Is *your* father dead?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (nods, whispers)
dialog: Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the
dialog: liver.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: *Liver* killed him?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: *Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself
dialog: to death.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: But did you know him?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Barely. It hardly mattered that I
dialog: knew him.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: Did you know your mother better?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (nods, still whispers)
text: She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: What's a nanny do?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: She looks after other people's
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: Did you grow up around here?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: No. She was an immigrant.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: What's an immigrant?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Someone not from Maine.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - NIGHT
text: The orphanage in moonlight. Not a sound.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - MORNING
text: The children are chasing a ball near the incinerator.
text: A VERY FRIGHTENED GIRL---not one of the orphans--is lying
text: next to the incinerator.
text: Edna kneels by the strange girl, who cringes with fear.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: No one's going to hurt you, dear.
dialog: Have you come to visit us? We have
dialog: beds, you know. Have you had any
dialog: breakfast? What's your name?
text: The girl won't speak; when Edna touches the girl's forehead,
text: she pulls back her hand in alarm.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM - MORNING
text: Edna is holding the head of the frightened young girl. The
text: girl is feverishly hot and whimpering; she keeps looking at
text: her feet in the stirrups as if she's an animal caught in a
text: trap. Larch and Homer stand on either side of her.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Her temperature is a hundred and
dialog: four.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (very gently)
dialog: How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
text: The girl shakes her head. The pain stabs her again.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Twelve? Are you twelve, dear?
dialog: (the girl nods)
dialog: You have to tell me how long you've
dialog: been pregnant.
dialog: (the girl freezes)
dialog: Three months?
text: Another stab of pain contorts the girl.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Are you *four* months pregnant?
text: The girl holds her breath while he examines her abdomen;
text: Homer very delicately examines the girl's abdomen, too.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (whispers to Larch)
dialog: She's at least *five*.
text: The girl goes rigid as Larch bends into position.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Dear child, it won't hurt when I
dialog: look. I'm just going to *look*.
text: Homer assists Larch with the speculum.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Tell me: you haven't done something
dialog: to yourself, have you?
scene_heading: TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL
dialog: It wasn't me!
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Did you go to someone else?
scene_heading: TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL
dialog: He said he was a doctor. I would
dialog: never have stuck that inside me!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Stuck *what* inside you?
text: Homer holds the girl still--she is babbling on and on while
text: Larch is examining her.
scene_heading: TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL
dialog: It wasn't me! I would never do no
dialog: such thing! I wouldn't stick that
dialog: inside me! It wasn't me!
text: Larch, his wild eye peering into the speculum, makes an
text: audible gasp from the shock of what he sees inside the girl.
text: Larch tells Homer to have a look. Larch then whispers
text: something to Edna; she brings the ether bottle and cone
text: quickly. Larch starts putting the cone in place, over the
text: nose and mouth of the frightened girl. Homer bends to the
dialog: speculum.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (to the twelve-year-
dialog: old)
dialog: Listen, you've been very brave. I'm
dialog: going to put you to sleep--you won't
dialog: feel it anymore. You've been brave
dialog: enough.
text: Homer stares into the speculum; he closes his eyes. The girl
text: is resisting the ether, but her eyelids flutter closed.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: That's a heavy sedation.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The
text: fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is
text: punctured, she has acute peritonitis,
dialog: and there's a foreign object. I think
text: it's a crochet hook.
text: Homer has pulled off his surgical mask. He leans over the
text: scrub sink, splashing cold water on his face.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: If she'd come to you four months ago
dialog: and asked you for a simple D and C,
dialog: what would you have decided to do?
dialog: *Nothing*? *This* is what doing
dialog: nothing gets you, Homer. It means
dialog: that someone else is going to do the
dialog: job--some moron who doesn't know
dialog: *how*!
text: Homer, furious, leaves the operating room. Edna lifts the
text: girl's eyelids for Larch so that he can see how well under
dialog: the ether she is.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I wish you'd come to *me*, dear child.
dialog: You should have come to me, instead.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING
text: Homer storms down the hall, then stops, pulling off his white
text: coat. Angry, pacing, he kicks at nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - GRAVEYARD - EARLY MORNING
text: Buster and Homer are digging the pit. Larch paces by the
text: coffin of the 12-year-old girl.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: What'd she die of?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (inhales deeply)
dialog: She died of *secrecy*, she died of
dialog: *ignorance*...
text: Buster nods, but he's totally bewildered.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: If you expect people to be responsible
dialog: for their children, you have to give
dialog: them the right to decide whether or
dialog: not to *have* children. Wouldn't you
dialog: agree?
text: Buster doesn't get it. Homer has heard this too many times;
text: he rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: How about expecting people to be
dialog: responsible enough to control
dialog: themselves to begin with?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: How about this child? You expect
dialog: *her* to be responsible?
text: Homer looks away.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I didn't mean her. I'm talking
dialog: about... adults.
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: You know who I mean!
text: Larch studies him.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. ST. CLOUD'S ROAD - TRUCK CAB - DAY
text: Buster is driving the old pickup truck, with the shovels and
text: a wheelbarrow in the back. Larch and Homer are in the cab,
text: they are being bounced all over the cab by Buster's wild
text: driving. Larch looks at Homer; he stares at him with a curious
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: What?!
text: Larch says nothing. Homer gives him a look.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: It's just a marvel to me that you
dialog: still have such high expectations of
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I'm happy I amuse you.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: Try to look at it this way. What
dialog: choice does Buster have? What are
dialog: his options? Nobody will ever adopt
dialog: him.
dialog: (Buster considers
dialog: this)
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Try to look at it *this* way. Buster
dialog: and I are sitting right here beside
dialog: you. We could have ended up in the
dialog: incinerator!
dialog: (Buster grins)
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Happy to be alive, under any
dialog: circumstances--is that your point?
text: Buster is distracted; he drives the truck into a ditch and
text: it bounces around, missing a tree by an inch. He is up on
text: the road again in a few seconds.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Happy to be alive... I guess so.
text: They are all distracted by a luxurious convertible that
text: overtakes them on the hill to the orphanage. The fast car is
text: driven by a handsome man in the uniform of the Army Air Corps--
text: a YOUNG OFFICER. From the passenger seat, a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
text: WOMAN smiles at them, rendering them speechless.
scene_heading: EXT. ORPHANAGE DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: The luxurious convertible (now parked) has drawn all the
text: orphans to it. The handsome young officer (WALLY) and the
text: beautiful young woman (CANDY) stand confused by the car;
text: they are surrounded by the curious orphans, with whom they
text: are painfully self-conscious. They are overly friendly to
text: the children as they are anxious of Larch and Homer and Buster
text: (in their gravedigging attire), who are getting out of the
text: truck. Nervously, Wally gives the children chocolates.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: So many children. Are they all
dialog: orphans?
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Well, this *is* an orphanage.
text: The kids climb into Wally's car.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Oh, they're getting into the car...
dialog: watch your fingers!
text: Curly tugs on Candy's dress, staring up at her, his face
text: already smeared with chocolate.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I'm the best.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: You are?
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (good with kids)
dialog: The best? Wow! The best at *what*?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I'm the best one.
text: Curly's nose is streaming snot. Candy kneels beside him and
text: holds her handkerchief to his nose.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Here, blow...
text: Curly tries to talk while she's holding his nose.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I really *am* the best, I just have
text: a cold.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Blow! There, I bet that feels better.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (sniffs)
dialog: Yeah.
text: The other orphans are dying with envy--Candy is so beautiful.
text: (Some, like Buster, are torn between Candy and the car.)
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Curly, come here!
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (to Larch)
dialog: *Tell* them! I'm the one.
text: Virtually all the orphans have climbed into Wally's car.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (to Wally)
dialog: I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing
dialog: a car like this.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: It's okay--I don't mind.
text: Larch, scowling, presents himself to the new couple.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: We brought some chocolates for the
dialog: kids.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (witheringly)
dialog: Chocolates. How *thoughtful*.
text: Larch picks up Curly and carries him toward the boys'
dialog: division.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I'm the best! *Tell* them!
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: You're the best, Curly.
scene_heading: INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Homer is seated in the desk chair. The impressive couple sit
text: in front of him.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: So, Mrs...
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Candy. Candy Kendall.
text: Wally jumps up to his feet to shake Homer's hand.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Wally. Wally Worthington.
text: Wally sits down. The three sit still for an awkward moment.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (to Candy)
dialog: How many months are you?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Two.
text: Homer writes on a piece of paper. Candy and Wally exchange a
text: worried look.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: So, now, uh... you're not... I mean,
dialog: do *you* do the--
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: No. Dr. Larch will be performing the
dialog: procedure.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Ah, well... okay. Good! I just
dialog: wondered...
text: Edna pokes her head in the door.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Excuse me, Homer. Dr. Larch said
dialog: this one is your turn.
text: Edna quickly sees that all three of them have misunderstood
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Oh, dear--I'm sorry. I meant the
dialog: circumcision. That boy you delivered
dialog: on Tuesday...
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Sure. Fine. Have you prepped him?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: I'll get started.
text: Candy and Wally can't conceal how impressed they are with
text: the young Homer.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Homer walks down the corridor, dressed in his operating gown,
text: as the door to the O.R. opens and Wally stumbles out,
text: hurriedly opening a window. Wally breathes deeply to regain
text: his composure.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: I think it was the ether--the smell
dialog: got to me.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: God. This is all my fault.
text: Edna comes down the hall with a dirt-stained, crying Curly
text: who's covering one eye.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (over the din)
dialog: Steerforth got into the pantry--he's
dialog: eaten all the pie dough.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (sobbing)
text: He wasn't sharing it, either.
speaker_heading: EDNA
text: He's down the hall, throwing up.
text: Homer nods to Edna, who is marching off with Curly. Wally
text: smiles at Homer.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: What kind of plane are you flying?
speaker_heading: WALLY
text: A B-24 Liberator.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Liberator...
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Have you enlisted?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV--
dialog: I've got a heart defect.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Really! Is it serious?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: No, it's not serious. I'm just not
dialog: supposed to get excited. You know--
dialog: no strain, no stress. I try to keep
dialog: calm all the time.
text: Wally hears Homer's facetiousness--how tired he is of his
dialog: heart condition.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Oh, well. I don't imagine there's
dialog: any strain or stress around *here*!
text: Homer appreciates the joke.
text: The door to the operating room that Wally exited opens into
text: the corridor; Candy is being wheeled out on a gurney by Larch
text: and Angela. Wally rushes to Candy's side. Homer follows
text: slowly. Candy is groggy, coming out of the ether.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: How is she doing?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Just fine.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (slurred speech)
dialog: Boy or girl?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: It was nothing--it's all over.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: It's all over, honey.
text: They walk Candy on her gurney. Homer looks after them.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (slurred speech)
dialog: I would like to have a baby, one
dialog: day. I really would.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Why, of course--you can have as many
dialog: children as you want. I'm sure you'll
dialog: have very beautiful children.
text: Larch wheels Candy behind a curtain.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: You'll have Princes of Maine! You'll
dialog: have Kings of New England!
text: Larch has a different tone of voice when he speaks to Wally.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I suggest you find yourself some
dialog: fresh air, Lieutenant.
text: Wally is left alone in the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. BOYS' DIVISION - DAY
text: Cranked at three-quarters, Fuzzy sits in bed, wheezing and
text: coughing. He's drawing with great intensity, using crayons
text: on a piece of paper held by a clipboard. Homer sits on the
text: end of Fuzzy's bed, cleaning up Steerforth. Homer pauses to
text: look out of the window; he sees Wally, dashing and spotless
text: in his uniform beside his flashy car. A life Homer might
text: have had crosses his face.
speaker_heading: FUZZY (O.S.)
dialog: Homer, when is Halloween?
text: Homer turns to Fuzzy, who holds up his picture--a big pumpkin
text: with a jack-o-lantern face.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Uh... it's the end of October.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: Is that soon?
text: Homer looks at Fuzzy; his little body is working hard just
dialog: to breathe.
speaker_heading: STEERFORTH
dialog: That's a few months away, Fuzz.
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: I still don't feel so good.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh. It's the best time! How come we
dialog: only get pumpkins once a year?
text: Fuzzy coughs and coughs.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
speaker_heading: FUZZY
dialog: Why can't we have pumpkins for
dialog: Christmas, too? We don't get any
dialog: good presents at Christmas, anyway.
text: Homer looks out the window at Wally again. His decision forms.
scene_heading: EXT. ORPHANAGE DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: Homer approaches the flashy car, where Wally is still pacing.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Has anyone offered you anything to
dialog: eat?
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Actually, someone did. I just didn't
dialog: think I could eat anything.
text: An awkward silence, which Homer covers by examining the car.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (trying to sound casual)
dialog: I wonder if you might give me a ride.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (unprepared)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
text: Homer nods, but he has no idea where Cape Kenneth is.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Cape Kenneth...
text: Wally nods.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: That sounds fine.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY/CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Homer runs up the stairs, two steps at a time; he races into
text: a corridor at full speed, exhilarated. Suddenly Dr. Larch
text: appears in front of him. Homer stops abruptly, out of breath,
text: unable to speak.
scene_heading: INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY
text: As Homer stands guiltily, Larch rifles through an X-ray file,
text: holding various X rays up to the lit screen. He quickly finds
text: the one he's looking for, attaching it briefly to the screen
text: for a confirming look--a heart X ray, which Larch waves at
text: Homer as he talks.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Doubtless you'll let me know what
dialog: immensely worthwhile or at least
dialog: *useful* thing it is that you find
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (restrained)
dialog: I wasn't intending to leave here in
dialog: order to be entirely useless--I expect
dialog: I'll find some ways to be of use.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: In other parts of the world, I suppose
dialog: there are other ways.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (still restrained)
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (blows up)
dialog: Are you really so *stupid* that you
dialog: imagine you're going to find a more
dialog: gratifying life? What you're going
dialog: to find is people like the poor people
dialog: who get left here--only nobody takes
dialog: care of them as well! And you won't
dialog: be able to take care of them, either.
dialog: There's no taking care of *anybody*--
dialog: not out there!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (feeling trapped)
dialog: You know I'm grateful for everything
dialog: you've done for me...
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: I don't need your gratitude.
text: Larch hands Homer the heart X ray.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: I don't need this--I know all about
dialog: my condition.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: It's your heart--you ought to take
dialog: it with you.
text: Camera closes on Homer with the X ray.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Buster and Mary Agnes are serving the evening meal while
text: Larch rails at Angela and Edna, who are helping Buster and
text: Mary Agnes. The sound of children in the dining hall is
text: intermittent and chaotic.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Going where? Does he have a plan of
dialog: some kind?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Will he be back soon?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I don't know! He's just leaving--
dialog: (to Angela)
dialog: you're the one who says he needs to
dialog: see the world!
dialog: (to Edna)
dialog: *That's* what he'll do--he'll see
dialog: the world!
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: He's leaving...
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: He'll need clothes... some money...
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Let him try to *make* some money!
dialog: That's part of "seeing the world,"
dialog: isn't it?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Oh, just stop it! You knew this was
text: going to happen. He's a young man.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (almost breaking)
dialog: He's still a boy--out in the world,
text: he's still a boy.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Just find him some clothes, Wilbur.
dialog: He could use some clothes.
text: Camera closes on Larch, fighting tears.
scene_heading: INT. BOYS' DIVISION - AFTERNOON
text: Homer is packing his things--we see the heart X ray, and
text: some photos of Larch and Edna and Angela.
text: Larch approaches Homer with a small bundle of clothes.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (gently, almost
dialog: reverently)
dialog: I think these will fit you.
text: Homer is grateful and ashamed. Before he can speak, Edna is
text: there--a wad of bills in her hand. She tries to put the money
text: in his pocket; when he refuses it, she simply puts the money
text: in his open suitcase, stuffing the bills under his clothes.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You'll need some money--just a little
dialog: something, until you find a job.
text: Larch and Edna retreat from him, humbly, as if they were his
dialog: servants.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON
text: As Homer puts his stuff in the truck of Wally's car, Angela
text: can't resist touching his face. She is too upset to speak.
text: From a window, Larch is watching the departure. He sees Homer
text: saying goodbye to the children, embracing them.
text: From another window, Fuzzy just stares. (Of course he's
dialog: coughing.)
text: We see Wally carrying Candy to the car.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: I'm okay--I can walk.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: I don't want you to walk--I want to
dialog: carry you. Should I put the top up?
dialog: It might get cold.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: No--keep it down. I want to feel the
dialog: air.
text: She speaks to Homer, touching his sleeve, like a sleepy
text: person, as Wally puts her gently in the backseat.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (still groggy)
dialog: Coming with us? It's always a good
dialog: idea to have a doctor along for the
dialog: ride.
text: Homer gets in the passenger seat beside Wally, who starts
text: the car; suddenly there is Curly. Homer can't look at Curly,
text: who looks betrayed. Edna picks up Curly and carries him to
text: the passenger-side window. Curly is sobbing.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I have to go, Curly. I'm sorry.
dialog: (to Edna)
dialog: I couldn't find Buster. Will you
dialog: tell him...
text: He can't finish what he has to say. Edna kisses him good-
dialog: bye.
text: From the window, Larch watches the car leave.
text: Buster, whittling a stick, isn't watching.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. WALLY'S CAR - ON THE ROAD - AFTERNOON
text: There is quiet as the journey gets underway. Wally keeps
text: glancing at Candy in the rear-view mirror; she seems distant,
text: lost in thought. Homer is taking everything in--the speed,
text: the road, the wind in his face.
scene_heading: INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT
text: Angela speaks to the boys.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Let us be happy for Homer Wells...
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT
text: In the girls' washroom, in front of the mirror by the row of
text: sinks, Mary Agnes is repeatedly slapping her face. Angela's
text: benediction to the boys plays Over this scene of violent
text: self-abuse. Except for the sound of the slaps. Mary Agnes
text: doesn't make a sound.
speaker_heading: ANGELA (O.S.)
text: Homer Wells has found a family. Good
dialog: night, Homer!
speaker_heading: ALL THE BOYS (O.S.)
dialog: Good night, Homer!
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT
text: On his bed, Larch is taking ether. We hear the refrain from
text: the boys in the bunk room Over.
speaker_heading: ALL THE BOYS (O.S.)
dialog: Good night, Homer! Good night, Homer!
dialog: Good night, Homer Wells!
scene_heading: INT. WALLY'S CAR - NIGHT
text: The radio is playing. Candy is lying down, her knees drawn
text: up, in the backseat; she appears to be asleep, oblivious to
text: Homer and Wally's conversation.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Actually, the Army has given me leave
dialog: twice. First when my father died,
dialog: and now I'm on leave to help my mother--
dialog: I'm just trying to get her ready for
dialog: the harvest. She's no farmer. Apples
dialog: were my dad's business. And with the
dialog: war on, she's short on pickers.
text: Candy's eyes are open but her voice is groggy.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: Wally thinks apples are boring.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: I never said they were boring.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: You said, "Apples aren't exactly
dialog: flying."
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Well, they aren't.
text: Homer looks back at Candy. Her eyes close.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I think I'd probably like the apple
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: You're a little overqualified, aren't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: No, I'm not. I need a job.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: The only jobs are picking jobs.
dialog: Picking apples is truly boring.
text: Candy's eyes snap open and she sits up a little.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: There! You said it was boring.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Well, *picking* them is! It's about
dialog: as exciting as... walking!
text: Candy seems irritated with Wally. Homer tries to engage her.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Is your family in the apple business,
dialog: too?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: No, but I work there--I like it. My
dialog: dad's a lobsterman.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I've never seen a lobster.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I've never seen the ocean, either.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: You've never seen the *ocean*?
text: Homer shakes his head, smiles.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: That's not funny... that's *serious*.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. ROADSIDE/CAR - NIGHT
text: The car is parked at the side of the road. Wally is half-
text: hidden behind a tree. Candy and Homer are left alone in the
text: car; there's an awkward silence as Homer pretends not to
text: hear Wally's excessive peeing. Suddenly Candy starts to sob.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: I couldn't have a baby with someone
dialog: who's leaving me--I didn't know what
dialog: else to do!
text: Homer is a doctor--he's used to postabortion reactions.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: He's going to be dropping bombs on
dialog: Mandalay! They're going to be shooting
dialog: at him!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Where's Mandalay?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Burma!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: I can't have a baby alone. I don't
dialog: even know if he's coming back!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I understand.
text: He doesn't, really. Wally returns. Wally leans over Candy to
dialog: hug her.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Honey, honey... of course I'll come
dialog: back.
text: Candy pounds on his chest with her fists.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: You don't *know*, Wally. You have no
dialog: *idea*!
text: Wally backs away. Candy sobs uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Stay away from me!
text: Wally signals to Homer to get out of the car.
text: Later, Wally and Homer stand outside the car, overhearing
text: Candy's weeping. Homer is smoking nervously.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (strictly medical)
dialog: This is all normal. Don't worry. The
dialog: abortion procedure... it affects
dialog: you. It's the ether, too. It'll take
dialog: a little time.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: I don't *have* any time. There's a
dialog: *war*!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: It's all very normal.
text: Wally looks at Homer, who takes a nervous drag on his
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: You ought to cut that shit out--it's
dialog: terrible for you.
text: Homer looks at Wally; he sees the authority in his eyes.
text: Homer drops his cigarette and puts it out with his foot.
text: They notice that Candy has stopped crying. Wally finds Candy
text: asleep in the backseat.
scene_heading: EXT. WALLY'S CAR - ON THE ROAD - LATE AT NIGHT
text: The lone car on the road. Snatches of war news from the radio
text: are the only sound as the headlights illuminate the dark
dialog: highway.
scene_heading: EXT. COAST OF MAINE - MORNING
text: The car is parked, with Homer sleeping in it alone. The sounds
text: of the ocean increase as Homer opens his eyes. Homer gets
text: out of the car and walks toward the beach, enchanted. There
text: it is: his first view ever of an ocean, the horizon, the sun
text: glimmering on the water. Candy is lying on a blanket in the
text: sand. Wally is throwing rocks in the water. Homer takes it
text: all in. When Candy calls for him, Homer walks up to her.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: I'm a little worried about the...
dialog: (she gestures below
dialog: her waist)
dialog: ...about how much bleeding is okay.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: It should taper off tomorrow, but it
dialog: can come back again. You have cramps?
dialog: (Candy nods)
dialog: They'll ease up, almost entirely. As
dialog: long as the bleeding isn't heavy,
dialog: it's normal.
speaker_heading: WALLY (O.S.)
dialog: Catch!
text: A football comes flying through the air toward Homer; it
text: bounces off his chest. Wally laughs.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (meaning the football)
dialog: Give it here!
text: Homer throws the football; it's clear he's never thrown one
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: What was *that*?! Come over here!
text: Homer runs over to Wally, who proceeds to show him how to
text: pass the ball. Snatches of his instruction drift to Candy,
text: who closes her eyes. "Put your fingers on the laces--no, it
dialog: rests in your palm, like this! You want the laces up--yes,
dialog: like that!"
scene_heading: EXT. COAST OF MAINE - DAY (LATER)
text: Homer and Wally sit on the beach a short distance from Candy's
text: blanket. She appears to be asleep. Wally looks in her
text: direction before he speaks to Homer.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: It's called the Burma run. It's about
text: a seven-hour round-trip flight between
dialog: India and China.
text: Wally draws a crude map in the sand.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: "Burma run" because you fly over
dialog: Burma...
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: *And* over the Himalayas. That's
text: called flying over the hump.
text: On Candy's face: she's not asleep; she's listening.
speaker_heading: HOMER (O.S.)
dialog: At what altitude?
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: I've got thirty-five minutes to climb
dialog: to fifteen thousand feet--that's the
dialog: first mountain pass.
text: Homer looks at Wally, thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: What lousy luck--I mean your orders...
dialog: to draw an assignment like that!
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (conspiratorially)
dialog: Actually, I volunteered.
text: Homer is shocked; he looks back at Candy, lowers his voice.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: It's the flying, right? You love to
dialog: fly, don't you?
text: Wally nods; he also gives a look in Candy's direction before
text: he responds.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: I love the bombing, too. But there's
dialog: also the Himalayas--they have the
dialog: most wicked air currents in the world.
dialog: I wouldn't miss flying there for
dialog: anything.
text: Homer's smile suggests that he's impressed, but that he
text: wouldn't have Wally's enthusiasm for the task. Wally laughs
text: and puts his hand on Homer's shoulder.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Uh, look... if you're serious about
dialog: wanting a job, picking apples isn't
dialog: that boring.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Oh, I would love that, Wally.
scene_heading: EXT. CAPE KENNETH - LOBSTER POUND - AFTERNOON
text: The car is parked at a lobster pound. Homer sits in the car
text: watching Wally carrying Candy's bag to the door. Candy stands
text: outside the car; she shakes Homer's hand.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: I guess I'll see you around the
dialog: orchards. Thanks for everything.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Sure... I'll see you around.
text: Candy turns and heads toward the house to catch up with Wally.
text: A lobsterman in his boat is approaching the dock. It's RAY,
text: Candy's father. Candy waves. "Hi, Daddy!" Homer glances at
text: Candy and Wally on the dock, kissing good-bye.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I love you, Wally.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN VIEW - WORTHINGTON HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Wally drives up to the Worthington house; he gets out of the
text: car. Homer sits in the car, admiring the beautiful farmhouse.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Come on. You have to meet my mom.
dialog: (conspiratorially)
dialog: If it comes up, I've been at a
dialog: wedding. That's where I met you, at
dialog: the wedding.
scene_heading: INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE - WALLY'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: Homer as never seen such a room: the sports trophies, the
text: photos of athletic teams, and of Candy with Wally. Model
text: airplanes are everywhere. Mrs. Worthington's voice comes
text: from the hall.
speaker_heading: OLIVE (O.S.)
dialog: Wally? I expected you earlier...
text: She appears in the doorway of Wally's room. Mrs. Worthington
text: (OLIVE) is an elegant, fiftyish New Englander, as handsome
text: as Wally, but more reserved. She is surprised to see Homer.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: This is Homer Wells--he's the most
dialog: overqualified apple picker you'll
dialog: ever meet, but he's dying to learn
dialog: the apple business.
text: Wally is taking his uniform off as he speaks, just dropping
text: it on the floor as he quickly puts on some farm clothes.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: How do you do, Homer Wells...
dialog: Homer has never met anyone like her.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: How do you do...
text: Mrs. Worthington starts picking up her son's uniform from
text: the floor. She is politely curious about Homer.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Were you a friend of the bride or
dialog: the groom?
text: Homer looks confused; he seems to have forgotten about the
text: alleged wedding. Wally puts his arm around Homer, urging him
text: into the hall.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Homer is everybody's friend, Mom...
dialog: the bride's, the groom's, mine,
dialog: Candy's, *everybody's*.
text: Homer is embarrassed, but Olive is obdurately well-mannered.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Well, perhaps you'll come to dinner,
dialog: Homer...
text: Wally calls to her as he pushes Homer down the hall.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Not tonight, Mom--he's got to meet
dialog: *Mr. Rose*!
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DUSK
text: Homer and Wally get out of the jeep at the cider house, a
text: barnlike building with adjacent sheds and, behind it, line
text: after line of trees--the apple orchards.
text: Homer sees an outdoor shower where THREE BLACK MEN are
text: showering. It is a wooden stall that leaves the shower's
text: occupants visible above and below their midsections. A FOURTH
text: BLACK MAN is caught naked, running behind the cider house
text: and out of sight as he wraps a towel around himself.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You already used up the hot water!
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: You're usin' my soap, ain't you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I ain't usin' no soap--it's too cold
dialog: to bother with soap!
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: There ain't never enough hot water,
dialog: soap or no soap.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: They're migrants.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (no clue)
dialog: Migrants?
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds.
text: They travel up and down the coast
dialog: with the seasons.
dialog: (leaning close to
dialog: Homer)
dialog: The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have
dialog: to let him be the boss.
text: Homer wonders what that means as Wally reaches for the door
text: of the cider house. Before Wally can knock, a pretty young
text: black girl, ROSE ROSE, bumps open the screen door with her
text: hip and throws a bucket of water in the grass--almost hitting
dialog: Homer and Wally.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: That sink's backed up again, Wally.
dialog: I thought you was gonna get me a
dialog: plumber.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Rose, this is Homer--Homer, this is
dialog: Mr. Rose's daughter, Rose.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Rose Rose?
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: No, no--Homer is a new *picker*.
dialog: He's going to stay here with you.
text: This gets the attention of the men on their way from the
text: showers. They walk over, towels around their waists.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: (suspiciously)
dialog: He's stayin' *here*?
text: The screen door swings open and shut again, startling them
text: all, as MR. ROSE comes out of the cider house.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: That daughter of mine sure is Miss
dialog: Hospitality, ain't she, Wally?
text: Grinning, Mr. Rose shakes Wally's hand. Rose Rose goes back
text: inside the cider house as Mr. Rose shakes Homer's hand. Homer
text: introduces himself.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You got lots of experience pickin',
dialog: I suppose.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Homer's got no experience, Arthur,
dialog: but he's smarter then I am. He's a
dialog: fast learner.
text: Mr. Rose looks briefly at the men, who wait for his reaction.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: This is history. Ain't that what
dialog: you're sayin', Wally? I guess we
dialog: makin' *history*... havin' this young
dialog: man stay with us!
text: Wally slaps Homer on the back; he goes inside the cider house
text: to help Rose Rose with the plumbing.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: See you later.
text: Homer looks at Mr. Rose for instructions. Mr. Rose stares
text: back at him with his enigmatic smile.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: So. What should I do now?
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
text: Out back, there's a shed. It's just
dialog: a mess. If that shed was better
dialog: organized, I could put my truck in
dialog: there.
text: Homer looks at Mr. Rose with an uncomprehending expression.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: If you're as smart as Wally says,
dialog: you know you sometimes gotta do one
dialog: job before you do another.
text: Homer thinks that over.
text: Later, Homer is cleaning out the shed.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - EVENING
text: The pickers all sit down to supper around a picnic table.
text: Homer with Mr. Rose, Rose Rose, and the other black pickers.
text: Mr. Rose takes an apple from a bowl on the table. Then he
text: pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion; he's so
text: fast, the knife seems to come out of nowhere. He begins to
text: peel the apple. Homer eyes Mr. Rose, but Mr. Rose's focus is
text: riveted to his apple and the long, perfect strand of peel
text: dangling from it.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You did a good job with that shed,
dialog: Homer.
text: Peaches breaks the awkward silence.
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: What kind of a name is Homer?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: It's the name of a cat. Originally.
dialog: Well, not *originally*.
text: Homer decides to stop. Another silence.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Now, now--we all got names, sensible
dialog: or not.
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: Peaches is from Georgia, where we
dialog: met him pickin' peaches. He's still
dialog: better with peaches than hs is with
dialog: apples.
dialog: (Peaches grins)
dialog: Jack here is new. And this here is
dialog: Hero, 'cause he was a hero of some
dialog: kind or other once. Ain't that right,
dialog: Hero?
text: There are some disrespectful suggestions from the pickers
dialog: concerning what his heroism might have been.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: And this here sensitive-lookin' fella
dialog: is Muddy. The less said about Muddy,
dialog: the better. Ain't that right, Muddy?
text: Muddy scowls at Homer, but he smiles at Mr. Rose.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Homer unpacks his suitcase. (His bed should be nearest Muddy's

text: smoking, is sitting on his bed, sharpening a knife. Hero and
text: Peaches are playing cards on one of their beds. Mr. Rose is
text: finishing shaving. Rose Rose watches Homer unpack.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: It's just my heart.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: What you got a picture of your heart
dialog: for?
text: He holds up the X ray, in order to show her.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: There's a little something wrong
dialog: with it. Just this part here--the
text: right ventricle. It's slightly
dialog: enlarged.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Yes, so what. It's nothing serious,
dialog: really. Just a small defect.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: It's big enough to keep you out of
dialog: the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Right.
text: Rose Rose picks up the book that Homer has put on the bed.
text: She studies the cover; it's "Great Expectations" by Charles
text: Dickens. She puts it down, restlessly.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: They told me I was too old to serve.
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: They told Muddy his feet was too
dialog: flat!
text: Everybody laughs, except Muddy.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: (to Peaches)
dialog: And you was "generally unfit," as I
dialog: recall.
text: Finished unpacking, Homer sits on his bed; he picks up "Great
text: Expectations" and begins to read. Rose Rose sits down next
text: to him, watching him read. Homer notices her interest.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Do you like to read?
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: I can't read. Nobody taught me.
text: Homer smiles politely and goes back to his book. Rose Rose
text: keeps looking over his shoulder at the pages.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: (pointing to the page)
dialog: What does it say there?
text: Homer looks around at the pickers lying in their beds,
text: smoking, listening. (Like bedtime stories at the orphanage,
text: he thinks; however, the picker's attitude is suspicious,
dialog: reserved.)
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "I looked at the stars, and considered
dialog: how awful it would be for a man to
text: turn his face to them as he froze to
dialog: death, and see no help or pity in
dialog: all the glittering multitude."
text: Homer looks up; there's no response.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (to Rose Rose)
dialog: More?
text: Some muttering, some giggling, mostly silence. Rose Rose
text: wants more, but suddenly Jack jumps out of bed and stomps to
text: the kitchen end of the cider house, where a piece of paper
text: is tacked to the wall. Jack is talking to Homer all the way.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Since you're the one who's smart
dialog: enough to read... what's this?
text: Jack points at the piece of paper. Homer gets up and looks
text: at it.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: It's a list of rules, it seems.
text: All the men groan--Jack swears and Peaches laughs.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: *Whose* rules?
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: They're for us, I suppose.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Go on and read 'em, Homer.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: "One. Please don't smoke in bed."
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: It's too late for that one!
text: All the smokers laugh and cough in their beds.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: (uncharacteristically
dialog: blunt)
dialog: Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules.
dialog: We didn't write them. I don't see no
dialog: reason to read them.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Okay...
text: Rose Rose stomps back to her bed. Her father absently snaps
dialog: his towel.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)
text: Everybody is asleep, except Homer. He is staring at the
text: ceiling in the quiet semi-darkness, the book lying on his
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: LARCH (O.S.)
dialog: (distant echoing)
dialog: Good night, you Princes of Maine!
dialog: You Kings of New England.
scene_heading: INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT
text: Dr. Larch is standing in the doorway to the boys' room; he
text: closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Homer, on his bed, closes his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT
text: Larch lies in bed with his eyes open. (No ether.)
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The cider house and the apple orchard in the moonlight.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARDS - MORNING
text: Wally in his farm clothes at the wheel of the Jeep--he is
text: racing through the orchards, dodging trees, with Homer in
text: the passenger seat, hanging on for dear life.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Remember this! In the morning, when
dialog: the tall grass is wet, you can make
dialog: the Jeep slide on the grass. Can you
dialog: feel it?
text: Homer is excited as Wally weaves among the trees--faster and
dialog: faster.
speaker_heading: WALLY
text: It's almost like flying.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: What about the trees?
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: The trees are flak--antiaircraft
text: fire from those geeks on the ground.
text: Wally brakes hard. The Jeep comes to a stop in the packing-
dialog: house area.
text: Candy has been waiting on the loading platform. The pickers
text: are working in the background.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (defensively to Candy)
dialog: I was just showing Homer the
dialog: orchards... kind of a geography
dialog: lesson.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (good-naturedly)
dialog: I know what you've been doing.
text: She pulls an apple branch, with an apple to two, out of the
text: vehicle's grille--or else the branch is wedged in the front -
text: bumper or headlight area. Candy playfully starts poking Wally
dialog: with the branch.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (to Wally)
dialog: You've been giving him a *flying*
dialog: lesson!
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (teasing her)
dialog: He *loved* it!
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: Didn't you?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Yeah, it was great.
text: Wally gets the apple branch away from Candy. He pins her
text: arms at her sides--he hugs her, kisses her. She doesn't
dialog: struggle.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (laughing to Homer)
dialog: He thinks people *like* to get whacked
dialog: by branches.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: *Homer* liked it!
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: Didn't you?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Yeah, sure. There's no stress or
dialog: strain around here...
text: They all laugh. Homer observes the happy couple.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY
text: Homer is walking with Wally and Candy. The orchards are
dialog: beautiful.
scene_heading: EXT. PACKING HOUSE - MORNING
text: Much activity: the pickers are unloading apple crates from a
text: full flatbed trailer. An angry-looking VERNON gives Homer an
text: evil glare. Homer spills some apples lifting the crate to
text: the loading platform.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What's wrong with you?
text: Mr. Rose takes Homer aside.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: That's Vernon. You best stay away
dialog: from him until he gets to know you
dialog: better--then you best stay away from
dialog: him *more*!
text: Wally, in full uniform, appears from inside the packing house;
text: he calls for Homer.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Out lieutenant's calling you, Homer.
dialog: Mind your ass.
text: Homer smiles are runs toward Wally.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. PACKING HOUSE - MORNING
text: Homer and Wally walk through the packing house, where the
text: HEFTY, LOUD WOMEN sort through the apples rolling by on the
text: conveyor tracks. Wally snatches an apple from one of them,
text: giving it to Homer.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: You getting along okay?
text: Before Homer can answer, the women interrupt.
speaker_heading: BIG DOT
dialog: Where is that Candy?
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Did she leave you, Wally?
speaker_heading: DEBRA
dialog: Who's the boy?
text: Wally makes an effort to introduce Homer, but he's
dialog: interrupted.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Wally, you can marry Debra if Candy
dialog: leaves you!
speaker_heading: BIG DOT
dialog: Wally's gonna marry *me* if Candy
dialog: leaves him!
speaker_heading: DEBRA
dialog: You can marry all three of us, Wally!
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: We can take turns.
text: Wally puts his hand to his heart.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: You girls make it hard for a guy to
dialog: go off to war.
dialog: (points to Homer)
dialog: But I'll leave my best man here to
dialog: pinch-hit for me.
text: As the women are left behind giggling, Wally continues talking
dialog: to Homer.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I
dialog: thought. I just wanted to be sure
dialog: you were settled in--and happy enough,
dialog: considering...
dialog: (grabbing another
dialog: apple from a crate)
dialog: Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick
dialog: it out for a bit?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Uh... actually, picking apples is as
dialog: much excitement as I want for a while.
dialog: I'm grateful for the job.
speaker_heading: WALLY
text: (his hand on Homer's
dialog: shoulder)
dialog: You're the one who's helping *me*,
dialog: Homer. You're going to give my mom a
dialog: little peace of mind while I'm gone.
dialog: Candy, too.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Well, sure... that's good, then.
dialog: (awkward pause)
dialog: All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the
dialog: lucky one.
text: Homer shakes his head. Wally stops walking; they both stop.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (more serious)
dialog: You want to fight about it?
text: Homer is unfamiliar with this kind of kidding around; at
text: first he is startled, but then he laughs. Wally laughs, too.
text: They shake hands.
text: Mr. Rose calls out to Homer from the tractor. The pickers
text: are impatiently waiting for him on the flatbed; they're going
text: back to the orchard. Homer has to run to catch up to them.
text: He jumps on the flatbed; he sees Wally waving good-bye.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY
text: High up in a tall tree on a couple of ladders, Mr. Rose and
text: Homer are picking side by side. Mr. Rose is picking with
text: high-speed perfection, but Homer is slower and fumbling--he
text: drops an occasional apple to the ground.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You pickin' more cider apples then
dialog: anythin' else. Them drops is good
dialog: only for cider. And you pickin' the
dialog: stems with the apples only half the
dialog: time. They good only for cider, too--
dialog: if you don't pick them stems.
dialog: (Homer watches him)
dialog: The rule is, you wanna pick the apple
dialog: *with* the stem, Homer. And see
dialog: here... see that *bud* that's just
dialog: above the stem? That's the bud for
dialog: *next year's* apple--that's called
dialog: the *spur*. You pick the spur, you
dialog: pickin' two years in one--you pickin'
dialog: next year's apple 'fore it have a
dialog: chance to grow. You leave that on
dialog: the branch, you hear?
text: Homer nods; he picks more carefully, with more concentration.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: (approvingly)
dialog: That's better. I can tell you got
dialog: yourself some education. Them's good
dialog: hands you got, Homer. Them hands you
dialog: got, they know what they're doin'--
dialog: ain't that right?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I guess so...
text: Homer can see over the apple mart parking lot from the top
text: of the tree. He can see the driveway of the Worthington house,
text: where Candy and Olive are saying a tearful good-bye to Wally.
text: Distracted, Homer drops another couple of apples, which Mr.
text: Rose observes with a wry smile.
speaker_heading: ANGELA (O.S.)
dialog: Wilbur! Wilbur!
scene_heading: INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Larch is doing something at his desk when Angela comes in.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Wilbur, you should read this.
text: Larch stares at Angela, who holds a letter.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: It's from the Board. Another letter.
scene_heading: INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Dr. Larch stands in front of a mechanical drawing easel. He
text: works intently with a calligraphic pen, but we don't see
text: what he's working on. Angela and Edna sit at the desk; they're
text: looking over the letter.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (quoting the letter)
dialog: Uh... "merely suggesting that some
dialog: new blood might benefit you all...
dialog: someone with new ideas in the
dialog: obstetrical and pediatric fields."
text: (she looks up at Larch)
dialog: I think they're just testing some
dialog: ideas for our next meeting.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Dr. Holtz seems nice. I think he
dialog: only wants to help...
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of
dialog: *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be
dialog: happy if he could help *commit* me!
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to
dialog: be careful of, Wilbur.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: One has to be more than "careful" of
dialog: Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient
dialog: Christian zeal to start her own
dialog: country! I'd like to give her a little
dialog: ether.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: So what are you going to do?
text: Larch puts down the pen, comes around the easel, opens a
text: drawer in a filing cabinet, and hands Edna a folder containing
text: a few cleanly typed pages. Larch returns to the easel, to
text: his painstaking work. Edna opens the file; as she and Angela
text: read the contents, Larch recites from memory as he works.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: "Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine,
dialog: March 2, 1915..."
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Homer was born *here*, in, what was
dialog: it, 1922?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: "...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935,
dialog: and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: This is *your* life story, Wilbur!
dialog: You just changed the dates!
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: "An internship and two years of
dialog: training at the Boston Lying-in,
dialog: South End Branch. For his age, he
dialog: was judged an accomplished
dialog: gynecological obstetrical surgeon;
dialog: he is also experienced in pediatric
dialog: care..."
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: You *invented* him! You've completely
dialog: made his up!
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Don't you understand? The board is
dialog: going to *replace* me! That's what
dialog: the "new blood" is *for*!
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You mean they'll replace you with
dialog: someone who won't perform abortions.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Well, we can only guess about that,
dialog: Edna. They *are* against the law.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: These *credentials* are against the
dialog: law!
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: We all know who trained Homer--his
dialog: credentials are as good as mine are.
dialog: Don't you be holy to me about the
dialog: *law*! What has the law done for any
dialog: of us here?
text: Edna and Angela think this over.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (points at file)
dialog: So here is my candidate. What do you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: But what about school records? Homer
dialog: doesn't have any *diplomas*...
text: Larch turns the easel around. Attached is a parchment headed:
text: "HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL"--it's a diploma-in-progress.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: He *will* have them, Edna.
text: The women are shocked, awed.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Oh, Wilbur, I don't know...
dialog: (sudden thought)
dialog: We don't even know where he is!
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE, ROOF - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE (O.S.)
dialog: Where's that Homer?
text: Homer stands in front of a ladder that leans against the
text: cider house; he starts to climb up, drawn by the murmuring
text: voices, the soft laughter.
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: Who cares?
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE (O.S.)
dialog: Now, now. He's a good boy.
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: Shit. We don't know what he is.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE (O.S.)
dialog: Jack, you gotta watch your language
dialog: 'round my daughter.
text: Homer arrives at the top and sees everyone sitting on a long
text: plank, a bench attached to the apex of the roof--obviously a
dialog: popular spot.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Here he is.
text: No one moves.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Where's your manners? Make room for
dialog: Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: What view?
text: Peaches slides over and Homer sits down.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Are we supposed to be up here? The
dialog: rules said...
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Homer, you the only one who's read
dialog: them rules, so you the only one who
dialog: feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
text: The others laugh.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: *What* view?
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Well, Muddy, we can look at all these
dialog: angry stars Homer's been readin' to
dialog: us about.
text: More laughter; Homer smiles, enjoying the teasing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (gesturing toward the
dialog: Worthington farmhouse)
dialog: I bet the view looks better from the
dialog: Worthin'tons'.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't
dialog: want to be in that Wally's shoes
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: (playfully, teasing
dialog: him)
dialog: Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's

speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: (teasing her back)
dialog: You lucky you in your work boots
dialog: tonight, girl...
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: What's lucky about that?
text: Rose Rose is being physically affectionate with her father--
text: lightly punching his arm, rubbing the top of his head.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You know where that Wally is tonight,
dialog: darlin'? He's up there in them angry
dialog: stars.
dialog: (gesturing at the
dialog: dark sky)
dialog: He's flyin' all around up there...
text: with them Japs shooting at him.
text: They all look up, imagining that. Homer more than the others.
text: Rose Rose, looking thoughtful, rests her head on her father's
text: shoulder. They are completely natural together.
scene_heading: EXT. CAPE KENNETH - APPLE MART - DAY
text: Homer and the pickers are loading crates of apples into a
text: shipping truck. Olive and Candy are consulting some papers

speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
text: They all on board, Mrs. Worthin'ton.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Thank you, Arthur.
dialog: (see is looking at
dialog: Homer)
dialog: And how is our Homer working out?

speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Oh, he's a smart young man, most of
dialog: the time--Wally was right about him.
text: Olive is looking over the rest of the picking crew.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: No rotten apples?
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: (it's an old way of
dialog: speaking that they
dialog: have)
dialog: No, no--not this year. Well... maybe
dialog: we got *one*, but it ain't Homer.
text: He means Jack, who gives Olive and Candy and Mr. Rose a
text: furtive look. Olive smiles at Rose Rose, who comes up to her
text: and Candy. Olive touches Rose Rose with affection.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Rose... dear girl, I'm sure I can
dialog: find you some other clothes.
dialog: (to Candy)
dialog: You must have some things that would
dialog: fit her.

speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: I have a *ton* of things that would

speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Now, now, Candy--this girl don't

speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: (charming)
dialog: Arthur, there's no such thing as a

dialog: she needs.
text: Olive waves good-bye as she moves toward her car. Candy turns
dialog: to Homer.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: So. Not bored yet?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I'm *never* bored! It's all very...
dialog: different for me... here.

speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: When I'm not thinking about Wally.
dialog: I'm not good at being alone.
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm
dialog: fine. I...
dialog: (struggling to change
dialog: the subject)
dialog: ...I don't suppose you've seen a
dialog: lobster yet.
text: Homer shakes his head. He looks at the tractor and the empty
text: trailer. Mr. Rose and the pickers are just watching them.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (more seriously)
dialog: You have to come to my dad's lobster
dialog: pound and see one, then.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Okay...
text: Homer looks toward the pickers sitting on the flatbed when
text: he hears the tractor start. Candy follows his gaze.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I better go.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: I don't think Mr. Rose would leave
dialog: without you.
text: Mr. Rose gestures for Muddy to drive off; the tractor trailer
text: pulls away.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Sorry!
text: Homer has to run to catch up.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Come next week!

scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - DUSK
text: An anxious-looking WHITE PLUMBER is fixing the kitchen sink

speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: Whoa--look at that Homer! He's gettin'
dialog: all dressed up for supper tonight!
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: He ain't gettin' dressed to have

speaker_heading: MR. ROSE

speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Yeah, we can wait all night for the

scene_heading: EXT. INLAND ROAD - DUSK

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hungry?

scene_heading: EXT. GANGPLANK, DOCK - DUSK
text: Homer and Ray and Candy go up the gangplank from the dock to

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: They're the garbage-eaters of the

text: bottom of the sea.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: They eat everything?
speaker_heading: RAY
text: Everything that falls to the bottom.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: It's time somebody ate *them*.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (to Candy)

dialog: They made him a captain already--

speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: He mentions Homer, too, you know.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: Wally said to say, "Hello."
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (equally awkward)
dialog: Oh! That's... nice.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: Wally said the most spectacular hits
dialog: were in the oil fields at Yenangyat.

scene_heading: EXT./INT. CAPE KENNETH/WALLY'S CAR - NIGHT
text: With the bicycle stowed in the trunk, Candy is driving Homer

text: in awe at the giant blank screen.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: A movie *outside*?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Yes. But it's closed all the time
text: now, because of the blackout.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: People watched the movies in their

speaker_heading: CANDY

speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Yes! I've only seen one, though.

speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: You've seen only one movie? Which

speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: "King Kong". It's really good.
text: Candy laughs.
speaker_heading: CANDY

scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL - EARLY MORNING
text: At one table, the children are happily eating apples; a few

text: an open packing crate of apples. Larch takes a bite from an
text: apple and spits it out. Angela takes the apple out of his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: That's a pie apple, Wilbur. Homer
dialog: said you're not supposed to eat it!
text: Angela hands him another apple.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: So he's an apple expert, is he?
text: Angela gives him a critical look as Larch takes a bite out
dialog: of the new apple.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior
dialog: taste--and crisp, too! You know, so
text: many apples are disappointingly mealy.
dialog: I wonder of most of the apples in my
dialog: life weren't meant for pies!

dialog: Wilbur, he picked them for us
dialog: himself...
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: You don't find it depressing that
dialog: Homer Wells is picking apples?
text: Both Edna and Angela glower at him.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Or that he can't be bothered to write
dialog: us a proper letter? A dissertation
dialog: on apples, we don't need!
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: He probably doesn't make much money
dialog: picking apples--he must have had to
dialog: pay to send them, too.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he
dialog: doesn't have money. If he gets hungry,
dialog: he can pick his dinner!
text: Larch angrily tosses the half-eaten apple into the garbage.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Wilbur, it's a *gift*! How can you
dialog: be angry with Homer for sending us a
dialog: *gift*?
text: Larch stares into space, depressed. Then he examines the
text: crate and finds the mailing label that says "OCEAN VIEW
text: ORCHARDS--CAPE KENNETH, MAINE." He rips it off, holds it up
text: triumphantly.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I'll show him a *gift*! I'll give
dialog: him a gift he can *use*!
text: Larch storms out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. CAPE KENNETH - MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
text: A newsreel from the war is playing on the screen--soldiers
text: marching, smiling, waving to the camera. Homer and Candy sit
text: together watching. Homer is completely fascinated; Candy
text: watches Homer as much as the news. Her expression changes
text: when the newsreel cuts to footage from an air raid.
scene_heading: EXT. CAPE KENNETH - MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
text: Candy and Homer walk out of the theatre, under the marquee
text: and past the poster for "Wuthering Heights."
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: But you looked as if you liked it.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I *did* like it. All I said was,
dialog: "It's not 'King Kong'."
text: Candy makes a face, but in good fun.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: First she loved him, then she didn't,
dialog: then no one else could have him...
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: She *did* love him!
dialog: (teasing him)
dialog: How many women have you known?
text: Homer is embarrassed; he ducks the question.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: And what did she die of, exactly?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: She was torn apart! She died of a
text: broken heart.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Oh, sure!
text: Homer smiles and shakes his head; Candy starts to laugh.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: What's the *medical* explanation?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Well, she was in a weakened
dialog: condition...
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I don't know! What about "King Kong"?!
dialog: Is that medically possible?
text: Homer smiles; he knows she's teasing him, and he likes it.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (mock serious)
dialog: At least King Kong knew what he
dialog: *wanted*.
text: Candy pushes him playfully. They're both having a good time,
dialog: *too* good a time.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY
text: Homer is picking apples in a big tree; Rose Rose is on a
text: ladder in the tree right beside him. She's picking about
text: twice as fast as he is, and he keeps dropping his apples. In
text: another tree, Muddy is watching.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: What is you *doin'* with that Candy,
dialog: Homer?
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: (imitating Mr. Rose)
dialog: He's makin' history, I suppose.
text: From the surrounding trees, the other pickers laugh.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I
dialog: hope.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: No trouble.
text: In adjacent trees, both Peaches and Hero are picking apples;
text: they can hear Homer and Rose Rose, too. (So can Mr. Rose.)
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: That Candy--she's the nicest girl I
dialog: know!
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: She's about the most beautiful girl
dialog: I ever seen--I don't know if she's
dialog: the nicest.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: She's the nicest *and* the most
dialog: beautiful girl I've ever known.
text: The men *oooh* and *aaah* at Homer's announcement--Mr. Rose,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: That sounds like you is in trouble
text: already, Homer.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: That's right--that sounds like trouble
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I'm not in trouble.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: Yeah, you is. I know when people is
dialog: in trouble, and you is.
text: Camera closes on Homer's face; he keeps picking.
speaker_heading: LARCH (O.S.)
dialog: His name is Homer Wells...
scene_heading: INT. ST. CLOUD'S - DINING HALL - EVENING
text: Edna and Angela face the Board of Trustees around a table.
text: Larch circles the table as everyone reads the contents of a
text: folder. Larch has provided a copy for each member. The three
text: elderly gentlemen on the Board don't speak; they just nod
text: their heads to everything Dr. Holtz or Mrs. Goodhall says.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: ...and his *pathetic* resume is the
dialog: best I've seen. Though I find it
dialog: hard to believe the Board would be
dialog: interested in this character.
speaker_heading: DR. HOLTZ
dialog: But he looks like an excellent young
dialog: man, a first-rate candidate!
speaker_heading: LARCH
text: He looks like a bleeding-heart
dialog: missionary *moron* to me, but that's
dialog: going to be the problem with any
dialog: doctor interested in coming here!
scene_heading: MRS. GOODHALL
dialog: Do you know him?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: *No*! I don't want to know him! He's
dialog: doing *missionary* work--in *India*!
dialog: I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's
text: either too holy or too busy to answer.
dialog: Maybe he got killed in the war!
text: Suddenly Steerforth bursts through the door, having been
text: pushed from behind by Mary Agnes. The two stop when they see
text: what's going on--not to mention Larch's stern expression.
text: They back out. Mary Agnes winking at Dr. Holtz before the
text: door closes. Mrs. Goodhall is ready to continue.
scene_heading: MRS. GOODHALL
dialog: I fail to see how someone courageous
dialog: enough to make a commitment to a
dialog: foreign mission is automatically to
dialog: be dismissed--that part of the world
dialog: requires precisely the kind of
dialog: dedication that is needed here.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter
dialog: here and we'll be shipping him south,
dialog: in a *coffin*!
scene_heading: MRS. GOODHALL
dialog: You can't think that a man who has
dialog: *served* under such conditions as
dialog: exist over there will be in the
dialog: slightest daunted by a little *snow*--
dialog: have you no idea how harsh and
dialog: primitive and full of *disease* that
dialog: part of the world is?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Then I suppose we can look forward
dialog: to catching various diseases from
dialog: him!
speaker_heading: DR. HOLTZ
dialog: But, Dr. Larch, he seems exceptionally
dialog: qualified...
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I'm not talking about his medical
dialog: qualifications. It's the *Christian*
dialog: thing that bothers me--I just don't
dialog: see it being of much *use* around
dialog: here.
scene_heading: MRS. GOODHALL
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: I fail to see how a little
dialog: Christianity could *hurt* anyone
dialog: here!
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Anyway, I was just showing you this
dialog: guy as an example of what's available--
dialog: I didn't think you'd be interested.
speaker_heading: DR. HOLTZ
dialog: We're *very* interested!
scene_heading: MRS. GOODHALL
dialog: Yes, *very*!
speaker_heading: DR. HOLTZ
dialog: You wouldn't be opposed to meeting
dialog: with him?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet*
dialog: him. What's his name again?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Dr. Homer Wells.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: I just hope he won't expect us to
dialog: say *Grace* all the time.
text: The three elderly gentlemen repeat the name.
scene_heading: MRS. GOODHALL
dialog: It's a nice name, very New England.
speaker_heading: DR. HOLTZ
dialog: Very *Maine*, a very *local*-sounding
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: *Very*!
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT
text: A song plays on the old phonograph as a happy Larch and Angela
text: dance. Edna interrupts them.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: I just wanted to ask you...
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be
dialog: foolish tonight.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Does he *know* he's supposed to be
dialog: in India? Does he even *want* to
dialog: come back?
text: This causes Larch to take the needle off the record.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: He's a field hand! What could possibly
dialog: hold him there?
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - RAINY DAY
text: The rain beats down on Olive's car. Homer gets soaking wet
text: as he leans in to talk to Candy, who's behind the wheel. Mr.
text: Rose calls to Homer from the doorway of the mill room.
scene_heading: INT. MILL ROOM - RAINY DAY
text: Mr. Rose is instructing Homer as they stand bottling cider
text: in their yellow slickers and rubber boots. Rose Rose is hosing
text: down the pressboards; Muddy and Hero and Peaches are operating
text: the grinder and the press. Jack is stirring the vat. In a
text: defiant, contemptuous way, Jack keeps flicking the ash of
text: his cigarette into the vat. This make everyone uncomfortable;
text: only Mr. Rose doesn't appear to notice.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Cider don't have no taste till later
dialog: in October--it's too watery now,
dialog: when we're usin' just them early
dialog: Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't
dialog: get no *good* cider till you're
dialog: pickin' them Golden Delicious and
dialog: them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins
dialog: and them Russerts...
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: What about the worms? Most of these
text: apples are the drops--off the ground,
dialog: right? There have to be worms.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Of *course* there's worms, Homer!
dialog: And what is them worms, really? They
dialog: just *protein*, them worms! They is
dialog: *good* for you!
text: Everyone but Jack laughs. He takes a last drag on his
text: cigarette, then deliberately drops it into the vat.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: That just ain't right, Jack--your
dialog: cigarette's gonna end up in nine or
dialog: ten gallons of this batch of cider!
dialog: That ain't right.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Them people drinkin' that cider,
dialog: they don't know there's a cigarette
dialog: in there!
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: It's not that hard to find it in
dialog: there, Jack--it'll take you just a
dialog: minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin'
dialog: in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: What business is you in, Jack? Just
dialog: tell me what your business is...
text: Jack looks for a translation from the other men, who are
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Just say you're in the *apple*
dialog: business, man. That's the only
dialog: business you wanna be in. Just say
dialog: it.
text: Jack pulls a knife on Mr. Rose.
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: (whispers excitedly
dialog: to Jack)
dialog: You don't wanna go in the knife
dialog: business with Mistuh Rose--just say
dialog: you're in the *apple* business, Jack!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Mr. Rose)
dialog: What business are *you* in?
text: We never see Mr. Rose's knife. We see the men circle each
text: other: Jack takes a swipe at Mr. Rose's head--then he steps
text: back, his yellow slicker slashed open. His slicker is opened
text: up, right up the middle. His shirt underneath the slicker is
text: slashed open, too--he feels his bare chest and stomach,
text: feeling for the cut. But there's no cut--Jack's not bleeding,
text: he's not even scratched. Just his clothes have been slashed.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: I'm in the *knife* business, Jack.
dialog: You don't wanna go in the knife
dialog: business with me.
text: Muddy turns Jack around and views his slashed clothes.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: You're lucky he didn't cut your
dialog: *nipples* off, man.
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: The good news, Jack, is you're half-
dialog: undressed for *swimmin'*...
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to
dialog: find when you're properly undressed.
text: Jack starts to undress for the vat.
text: Mr. Rose ushers Homer and Rose Rose outside.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - RAINY DAY
text: Mr. Rose has cut his own hand in the fight. Homer's
text: professionalism if offended to watch Rose Rose's amateurish
text: efforts to stitch up her father's wound, but clearly this
text: isn't the first time she's done it.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Give men that. I know how to do it.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Almost.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: I don't need no "almost" a doctor,
dialog: Homer.
text: Homer can't bear to watch Rose Rose at work with the needle.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: We should drown that damn Jack in
dialog: the vat!
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs
dialog: to know what business he's in.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy--
dialog: you just about cut your own hand
dialog: off, and all you cut off *him* was
dialog: his clothes!
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You oughta know you don't go to jail
dialog: for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't
dialog: that right, Homer?
text: Homer winces at the stitching.
scene_heading: INT. WALLY'S CAR - DRIVE-IN THEATRE - EARLY EVENING
text: Wally's car comes bouncing along the ditches of the closed
text: drive-in. Homer is at the wheel; Candy calls out some driving
text: instructions. The car comes to a stop next to a speakerpost.
text: Candy leans out; she grabs the speaker and hangs it on the
text: window. Homer sits back and drapes his arms out the window
text: and over the seat. He feels great.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: You're a natural. You were born to
dialog: drive a car like this.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You think? Maybe I was.
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: I love this place!
text: Homer looks up at the giant movie screen.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: The screen is enormous! Imagine King
dialog: Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot
dialog: of movies here?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Yes... and no. When you come here,
dialog: you don't really care about the movie.
text: Homer stares at Candy in disbelief.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You don't care about the movie?
text: Candy looks at him for a moment.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: What are you so crazy about the movies
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: It was my favorite night at the
dialog: orphanage--movie night. We'd race
dialog: into the dining hall. Of course
dialog: everyone wanted to sit in front, so
dialog: we'd be packed in so tight you could
dialog: feel the kid next to you breathing.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: At least you were never lonely.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I didn't say that. Growing up in an
dialog: orphanage, you're always lonely.
dialog: You're just never alone.
text: Candy is moved. Homer feels exposed; he tries to change the
text: mood by making light of what he's said.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You're not alone in the bathroom,
dialog: or... or in the shower... you're
dialog: never alone in wanting the last piece
dialog: of meatloaaf, or even in your own
text: bed on a cold morning.
text: Candy laughs.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: You don't miss it?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I miss things. I miss... people.
dialog: (with certainty)
dialog: I miss reading to the boys.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: But you had so much *responsibility*.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I never *asked* for any
dialog: responsibility.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Just a little privacy.
text: Homer laughs.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Privacy is exactly the point of drive-
dialog: in movies.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Did you come here with Wally--to
dialog: *not* watch movies?
text: At the mention of Wally they both look a little self-
text: conscious.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Ah-ha.
dialog: (points to the speaker)
dialog: So what is that--a radio?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
text: Candy looks at Homer.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Scrunch down like this.
text: Candy scrunches down in her seat; Homer imitates her. Homer
text: is focused on the giant screen.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: How could you not *care* about the
dialog: movie?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: You just cuddle. You come to hug...
dialog: to kiss. You don't *come* here to
dialog: watch the movie.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (teasing her)
dialog: That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd
dialog: watch the movie.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
text: Homer's expression changes from exhilarated to guilty. He
text: leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen.
text: Candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder. Homer looks
dialog: afraid to breathe.
text: From behind, with her head on his shoulder, they look like a
text: normal couple. We track in toward the huge screen until we
text: see only the screen. There are shadows on the black screen.
text: Suddenly the movie "King Kong" appears.
scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT
text: "King Kong" is playing against the bare, white wall. Fuzzy
text: is very weak, but he smiles at the sight of the love-struck
text: Kong holding the screaming Fay Wray in his giant hand. Dr.
text: Larch runs the projector; he sits close beside Fuzzy. When
text: the film breaks in the predictable place, Fuzzy makes no
text: protest. Dr. Larch looks at Fuzzy, who has stopped breathing;
text: his eyes are closed.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: Fuzzy? Fuzzy?
text: They are alone in the dining hall. Larch has wheeled in Fuzzy
dialog: for a private viewing.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - GRAVEYARD - MORNING
text: Buster helps Larch lower the small coffin into the grave.
text: The tiny gravestone says "F.S."
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: What are you going to tell the little
dialog: ones?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: Why would the little ones believe
dialog: that *anyone* would adopt him?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: They'll believe it because they want
dialog: to believe it.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: Shouldn't we tell Homer?
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: If Homer wanted to know what was
dialog: happening here, he could pick up a
dialog: telephone and call us.
scene_heading: INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT
text: The boys in their beds listen to Buster inventing Fuzzy's
dialog: "family."
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: It was a family with a better
dialog: breathing machine then the one Dr.
dialog: Larch built.
scene_heading: INT. ST. CLOUD'S - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Larch leans against the wall, covering his eyes, overhearing
dialog: the boys.
speaker_heading: BUSTER (O.S.)
dialog: The family that adopted Fuzzy, they
dialog: *invented* the breathing machine.
dialog: It's their business... breathing
dialog: machines.
text: Larch pauses; he waits to see if they believe this.
speaker_heading: CURLY (O.S.)
dialog: Lucky Fuzzy!
text: Larch almost breaks with a sudden sharp breath.
speaker_heading: ALL THE BOYS (O.S.)
dialog: Good night, Fuzzy! Good night, Fuzzy!
dialog: Good night, Fuzzy Stone!
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - MORNING
text: As the men sit at the picnic table eating their cornbread,
text: Rose Rose pours coffee. A jeep comes down the orchard road
text: toward them. It's Olive. Mr. Rose leads the "Good mornin',
text: Mrs. Worthin'ton!" greeting. Olive has an armful of clothing
text: and a fairly sizable package; she brings the latter over to
dialog: Homer.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Some mail for you, Homer.
text: Homer shakes the package; he puts the package beside the
text: table, unopened. Olive turns to Rose Rose.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: And some clothes for you, dear--
dialog: (nodding to the cider
dialog: house)
dialog: let's go see if they fit.
text: Mr. Rose watches Rose Rose and Olive disappear into the cider
text: house. The other men view Homer's package with curiosity,
dialog: especially Peaches.
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Mind your own business, Peaches.
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: Sorry, Homer...
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT
text: Homer lies awake in bed; everyone else is asleep. Homer pulls
text: the package out from under his bed, opening it just enough
text: to see what it is; then he shoves it back under his bed.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN/BEACH - DUSK
text: The beach at sunset. Candy and Homer, dressed for cooler
text: weather, are alone at the water's edge. From a paper bag,
text: Candy is scattering some small, brightly colored pieces of
text: broken glass.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Aren't you worried that people will
dialog: cut their feet?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Nobody will swim here until next
dialog: summer. By then, the water will have
text: rubbed the glass smooth against the
dialog: sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
text: She finds and old piece of glass among the stones and shells
text: at the high-tide mark.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: See? That's last year's glass, or
dialog: from some year before. I put glass
dialog: here every year. The ocean makes it
dialog: beautiful.
text: Candy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for Homer to look
text: at. The ocean is a gray-green color, the glass a paler shade
text: of green.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Give me your hand.
text: She rubs the smooth piece of glass against his hand, then
text: throws it toward the water. It falls short. Homer retrieves
text: it. Candy splashes him playfully. He chases her away from
text: the beach, into the pine trees. Homer locks his arms around
text: her, from behind. He can't let go. She lets him hold her,
text: then breaks his grip. She turns to face him. She is taller
text: then he is, older, obviously more experienced. She initiates
text: the kiss. They drop to the ground right there; they make
text: love by the roots of the tree, Candy guiding him.
scene_heading: EXT. WALLY'S CAR - BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: They come out of the woods, walking toward the car, Candy
text: leading. We hear Candy talking just before we see her and
dialog: Homer.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (increasingly upset)
dialog: *Nobody* volunteers for the Burma
dialog: run--he said so himself. And nobody
dialog: knows *me* better than him! So how
dialog: am I supposed to feel? He's a bomber
dialog: pilot and I'm just selfish, I know.
dialog: Well, I'm *not* a brave little girl
dialog: and I'm *not* sorry.
text: She sits in the passenger seat, Homer in the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: I *know* this was right.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I told you. I'm not good at being
dialog: alone.
dialog: (pause; in a whisper)
dialog: I told him, too.
text: Homer concentrates on starting the car.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (repeating herself)
dialog: I *know* this was right.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Right.
text: Their expressions, as the car pulls away, belie their words.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - END OF DAY
text: Homer and Mr. Rose sit opposite each other at the picnic
text: table. Rose Rose stands behind her father, her hands on his
text: shoulders, watching Homer snip out Mr. Rose's stitches--very
dialog: quickly.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a
dialog: big hurry.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You still doin' it too fast!
text: Job done, Homer leaves the table and hurries to the bicycle,
text: pedaling away. Rose Rose watches Homer go, as Mr. Rose flexes
text: his healed hand.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: He's in a big hurry, all right. I
dialog: told you he's in trouble.
scene_heading: EXT. CAPE KENNETH - LOBSTER POUND - EVENING
text: Candy and Homer sit on the dock. Candy still seems to be
text: wrestling with her conscience. Homer throws snails in the
text: sea. It's cold.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Just tell me. Do you want me to go?
dialog: Do you want me to stay?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: It will be okay.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: *What* will be okay?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: We have to wait and see. I think
dialog: that, for *everything* in life, you
dialog: have to wait and see.
text: Homer throws a snail with more force.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I'll just move on, get another job
dialog: somewhere.
text: Ray comes out onto the dock; he sees Homer throwing another
dialog: snail.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Every time you throw a snail off the
dialog: dock, you're makin' someone start
dialog: his whole life over.
text: Candy throws a handful of snails into the water.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Maybe we're doing the snails a favor,
dialog: Daddy.
text: Ray looks at the two of them; he sighs.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack
dialog: it in.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Good night, Daddy.
text: Ray nods good night; he leaves. Homer looks expectantly at
dialog: Candy.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: We'll just have to wait and see.
scene_heading: INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Olive and Homer sit at the dining-room table, the remnants
text: of an apple pie in front of them. Homer is still eating.
text: Pictures of Wally are on the wall.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: I used to hate it when Wally went
dialog: back to college--even when it was
dialog: just college! And this was when his
dialog: father was still alive... I hated it
dialog: even then. Naturally I hate this
dialog: more.
text: Homer nods in sympathy. His mouth is stuffed with apple pie.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: What I mean is... I would like it
dialog: very much if you thought you could
dialog: be happy here, Homer.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (wiping his mouth)
dialog: Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very
dialog: lucky to be here.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: There's not a lot of work in the
dialog: winter, and you'll have to tolerate
dialog: Vernon--even Wally despises him, and
dialog: Wally likes everyone.
text: Olive's thoughts drift; her eyes look up at a photo of Wally.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I think Wally will be fine, Mrs.
text: Worthington--he seems indestructible
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (intently at Homer)
dialog: Just promise me one thing.
text: Homer is tense. Does Olive suspect about Candy?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Uh... sure.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Just promise me that, if there's a
dialog: blizzard, you'll move into Wally's
text: room until it's over.
text: They both laugh, but Homer has a hard time looking her in
dialog: the eye.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAY
text: The pickers are moving out; the harvest is over. Olive and
text: Homer stand near the door to the bunkhouse, talking--we can't
text: hear their conversation. Rose Rose and the other men walk
text: past them, carrying the last of their belongings to the truck.
text: Olive and Homer walk over to the truck.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Good-bye. Have a safe trip home.
dialog: Thank you, again, for all your hard
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You take care now, Mrs. Worthin'ton.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Good-bye, Arthur.
dialog: (she hugs Rose Rose)
dialog: Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Right.
text: Olive gets in her Jeep and waves as she drives off.
text: The truck is packed. Muddy tugs on a rope that secures the
dialog: load.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: (to Mr. Rose)
dialog: We all set, I think.
text: Mr. Rose nods and gets in behind the wheel. Rose Rose and
text: Muddy get in next to him. The others are bundled up for the
text: ride in the open back of the truck.
text: As they're leaving, Homer waves good-bye--the pickers calling
text: out to him.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You all take care of yourself, too,
dialog: Homer!
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: We see you next harvest.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Don't freeze to death, Homer.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Go on and freeze to death if you
dialog: want to, Homer.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
text: Homer stands looking after them, after they're gone.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - LATER THAT SAME DAY
text: Homer is alone, rearranging his stuff--spreading out a bit,
text: making the place his own. (On the other beds, we see the
text: mattresses rolled up on the bare bedsprings.)
speaker_heading: CANDY (O.S.)
dialog: So, you're staying.
text: Homer turns; he hadn't seen Candy come in.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Olive told me.
dialog: (awkward pause)
dialog: You might have told me yourself.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I'm just waiting and seeing. Like
dialog: you said.
text: She smiles. He goes to her; they embrace.
text: BEGINNING A MONTAGE OF THE NEXT NINE OR TEN MONTHS.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

speaker_heading: HOMER (V.O.)

scene_heading: EXT. RAY'S LOBSTER BOAT - DAY
text: Homer is learning how to "haul" a lobster pot with Ray and
dialog: Candy's guidance.
speaker_heading: HOMER (V.O.)
dialog: ...although it seems that I will not
dialog: have the occasion to use it.
scene_heading: EXT. LOBSTER POUND, FLOATING PENS - EVENING
text: Following Ray's example, Homer is trying to "disarm" the
text: lobsters' big claws by blocking them shut with the little
text: wooden wedges. Roy works quickly, never getting pinched. As
text: Candy watches, Homer gets pinched.
speaker_heading: HOMER (V.O.)
dialog: Barring some emergency, of course. I
dialog: am not a doctor. With all due respect
dialog: to your profession. I am enjoying my
dialog: life here.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Homer and Candy are naked. They have pulled two beds together
text: and made a double bed. He can't take his eyes off her.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I've looked at so many women... I
dialog: mean, I've seen *everything* about
dialog: them, *everything*... but I never
dialog: felt a thing. I felt nothing. Now...
dialog: with you... it *hurts*... to look at
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - DAY
text: Edna and Angela and Larch are all reading Homer's letter,
text: their lips moving silently as they read the words.
speaker_heading: HOMER (V.O.)
dialog: I am enjoying being a lobsterman and
dialog: an orchardman--in fact, I have never
dialog: enjoyed myself so much.
scene_heading: INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, FIREPLACE - NIGHT
text: Olive and Homer and Candy are playing a board game around
text: the fireplace.
speaker_heading: HOMER (V.O.)
dialog: The truth is, I want to stay here. I
dialog: believe I am being of *some* use.
scene_heading: INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Edna and Angela view him anxiously from the doorway as Larch
text: furiously types and types.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: My dear Homer, I thought you were
dialog: over your adolescence, that period
dialog: which I would define as the first
dialog: time in our lives when we imagine we
dialog: have something terrible to hide from
dialog: those who love us.
scene_heading: INT. WALLY'S CAR - DAY
text: Candy is singing to the car radio, as animated and happy as
text: we've ever seen her. Homer, driving, can scarcely keep his
text: eyes on the road; he has to keep looking at her.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: Do you think it's not obvious to us
dialog: what's happened to you?
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
text: With the radio playing (a popular song), Homer hops across
text: the bare floor, pulling on his boxer shorts; he opens the
text: door to Olive, who's holding out an armload of blankets to
text: him. He sheepishly thanks her. When Homer closes the door,
text: we see a hidden (and stricken) Candy, naked from their
text: interrupted lovemaking.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: You're fallen in love, haven't you?
dialog: By the way, whatever you're up to
dialog: can't be too good for your heart.
dialog: Then again, it's the sort of condition
dialog: that can be made worse by worrying
dialog: about it. So don't worry about it!
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY
text: Vernon and Homer are working under an apple tree; they are
dialog: poisoning mice.
speaker_heading: HOMER (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Dr. Larch, what I am learning
dialog: here may not be as important as what
dialog: I learned from you, but everything
dialog: is new to me. Yesterday I learned
dialog: how to poison mice. You use poison
text: oats and poison corn.
scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL - EVENING
text: Supper chaos--Buster and Mary Agnes are doing their best to
text: stop a food fight while Larch and Angela and Edna are

speaker_heading: HOMER (V.O.)
text: Field mice girdle an apple tree.
dialog: Pine mice kill the roots. I *know*

dialog: close as I want to come to playing
dialog: God.
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATRE - CAPE KENNETH
text: Homer and Candy are watching "Rebecca".
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: Do I interfere? When absolutely
dialog: helpless women tell me that they
dialog: simply *can't* have an abortion,
dialog: that they simply *must* go through
dialog: with having another--and yet another--
dialog: orphan... do I interfere? *Do* I? I
dialog: do not. I do not even *recommend*. I
dialog: just give them what they want: an
dialog: orphan or an abortion.
dialog: (close on Homer)
dialog: You are my work of art, Homer.
dialog: Everything else has been just a job.
dialog: I don't know if you've got a work of
dialog: art in you, but I know what your job
dialog: is. You're a doctor!
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY
text: The radio is playing a slow, sexy dance number. The fat ladies
text: from the apple mart are dancing as they paint the interior
text: walls of the bunk house.
speaker_heading: HOMER (V.O.)
dialog: I am not a doctor.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: You know everything I know, plus
dialog: what you've taught yourself--you're
dialog: a better doctor then I am and you
dialog: know it!
text: Homer is finishing up painting the kitchen walls. When he
text: gets to the list of rules, tacked on the wall, he removes
text: the list and finishes painting under where the rules were.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: They're going to replace me, Homer!
dialog: The Board of Trustees is looking for
dialog: my *replacement*!
text: Two of the ladies unroll the rolled-up mattresses on the
text: bare bedsprings, as Vernon enters with an armload of blankets
dialog: and pillows.
speaker_heading: HOMER (V.O.)
dialog: I can't replace you! I'm sorry...
text: Homer holds up the list of rules, rereads it briefly; he
text: walks over to an unpainted beam, a support beam, and tacks
dialog: the rules on this beam.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE, ROOF - MORNING
text: Homer reads Larch's letter, sipping coffee.
speaker_heading: LARCH (V.O.)
dialog: Sorry? I'm not 'sorry'! Not for
dialog: anything I've done. I'm not even
dialog: sorry that I love you!
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT
text: Larch sits on his ether-bed with a letter from Homer in his
text: hand. He looks completely deflated. Angela is standing in
text: the doorway.
speaker_heading: LARCH
dialog: I think we may have lot him to the
dialog: world. He's not coming back.
text: END OF THE MONTAGE.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - EARLY EVENING
text: In the newly painted, spruced-up cider house, Homer and Candy
text: are dancing to another slow, sexy song on the radio. He is
text: untucking her blouse, feeling under her blouse--she starts
text: to unbutton his shirt. They kiss while they dance. But the
text: song changes abruptly on the radio to something fast and
dialog: silly.
text: Homer responds to the music, dancing goofily--instantly out
text: of the mood. Candy laughs, but she picks up a pillow and
text: swings it at him, hitting him. He dances away from her. She
text: throws the pillow; he ducks--the pillow lands somewhere near
text: the door. Now Homer grabs a pillow and chases her from bed
text: to bed. She shrieks--they're both laughing. They each grab a
text: pillow and stand toe to toe whacking each other, laughing
text: all the while, until he pins her arms behind her and,
text: breathing hard--and despite the stupid music that broke the
text: mood--they are passionately kissing again.
text: The sound of a truck is sudden and loud.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAY
text: Mr. Rose's truck has arrived. The pickers are hopping out of
text: the truck, grabbing their gear.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY
text: The door opens. Hero and Peaches barge in, as Homer and Candy
text: are struggling to return the pillows to the beds.
speaker_heading: HERO
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: It's that Homer!
text: Muddy is right behind them. He picks up a pillow, off the
text: floor, looking for which bed it belongs on.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: It's that Candy, too...
text: Then comes Mr. Rose, slyly smiling, taking it all in--there's
text: no hiding what's going on. Homer and Candy are caught, their
text: shirts untucked and half-unbuttoned--they're still out of
text: breath. The pillows lie crazily on the beds, each one of
dialog: which has been stepped on.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Don't this place look like home?
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: It look nicer then home!
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: What have you two been doin' to make
dialog: it look so nice?
text: Rose Rose enters. She looks hardened, toughened--not happy.
text: She plops down her stuff on her bed, looking only at Candy.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: How is that Wally doing?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Oh, he's fine! I just heard from
dialog: him. He's bombing all these places...
text: Homer tries to help out.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: ...bridges, oil refineries, fuel
dialog: depots...
text: He peters out, knowing how sick of hearing this Candy is. He
text: tries to change the subject.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Where's Jack?
text: There is an uncomfortable silence.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: He just wasn't up for the trip.
dialog: More silence.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: That Jack just never knew what his
dialog: business was.
dialog: One look at Muddy and we know something pretty bad happened
dialog: to Jack.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY
text: The pickers on their ladders, all picking. Homer is now a
text: good picker; he looks over at Rose Rose. She is slumped
text: against the ladder, not picking, completely ignoring an
text: argument beneath them in the aisle between the trees. (Mr.
text: Rose is checking over the apples Peaches has just picked.)
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You pickin' nothin' but cider apples,
dialog: Peaches--I hope you understand that.
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: They ain't drops--I picked 'em off
dialog: the tree!
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they
dialog: ain't no better than drops to me.
dialog: See that bruise, and that one? *Half*
dialog: of these is bruised! Look at this
dialog: one! It ain't got no stem! You might
dialog: as well *step* on 'em, too--they
dialog: only good for cider.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARDS - DUSK
text: In the aisle between the trees, Homer and Candy are arguing
text: in one of the work vehicles.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Do you think I'm having a good time?
dialog: Do you think I'm just *teasing* you?
dialog: Do you think I *know* whether I want
dialog: you or Wally?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: So we should "wait and see." For how
dialog: long?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: I grew up with Wally. I began my
dialog: adult life with him.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Fine. That's all there is to it then.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: No! That's not all there is to it! I
dialog: love you, too--I *know* I do.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: It's a good thing I didn't have that
dialog: baby, isn't it?
text: Her sudden hardness leaves him speechless as they go their
text: separate ways. Candy drives on.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - SUNNY MORNING
text: Breakfast time at the picnic table. Rose Rose by herself,
text: away from the table. She does not look well; she suddenly
text: goes back inside the bunkhouse.
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: Ain't you eatin' with us, Rose?
dialog: (to the men)
dialog: She used to eat with us. Now we ain't
dialog: good enough for her, I guess.
speaker_heading: HERO
dialog: She ain't hungry, maybe.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: She ain't hungry every mornin' 'cause
dialog: she's sick every mornin'.
text: Homer gets up to take his dishes inside.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN AND BUNKHOUSE - MORNING
text: When Homer comes in, Rose Rose is throwing up in the sink.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You okay, Rose?
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: I guess you must like watchin' me be
dialog: sick...
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I don't like watching anyone be sick.
text: Rose Rose lies down on her bed with the curtain open. There
text: is something familiar about the way Homer approaches her
text: bedside; he does so with the authority of a doctor. He sits
text: on the edge of her bed with such complete self-assurance
text: that she doesn't protest.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: How many months are you?
text: She just stares. But she doesn't stop him when he touches
text: her abdomen. It's as if she knows that he knows what he's
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You're not yet three months, are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: Not yet. What do you know about it?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I know more than I want to know about
dialog: it. Who's the father?
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: Don't trouble yourself about it,
dialog: Homer--this ain't your business.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: But you don't look very happy.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: *Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How
dialog: am I supposed to take care of a baby!
dialog: I can't have a baby.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Rose, please listen. Whatever you
dialog: want to do, I can help you.
text: She is taken back.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: What I mean is, if you don't want
dialog: to... keep the baby, I know a place
dialog: where you can go.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: You think Daddy's gonna let me go
dialog: anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
text: She rolls over on the bed, facing away from him again.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: Why don't you just go back to your
dialog: pickin', Homer? I can take care of
dialog: it myself!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Rose, listen--don't *do* anything.
dialog: You know, I mean to yourself. Please
dialog: listen...
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE (O.S.)
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Homer! Is this a workin' day or what?
scene_heading: EXT. LOBSTER POUND - EVENING
text: Homer and Candy are sitting at the dock.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: We should take her to St. Cloud's.
dialog: That much is obvious, isn't it? Let
dialog: her make up her mind when she gets
dialog: there...
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I told her! She doesn't feel she can
dialog: do that. Something about her father
dialog: not letting her go anywhere...
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Well, we have to help her!
text: Homer doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: We have to do *something*. Don't we?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Homer?
text: Homer looks out over the ocean; he remains unresponsive.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - MIDDAY
text: Rose Rose is setting the picnic table for lunch when Candy
text: arrives.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Hi...
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: Hi...
text: She keeps setting the table.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: I've got some more clothes for you--
dialog: I just keep forgetting to bring them
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: I don't need no more clothes, thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Rose, I know what's going on. Homer
dialog: told me. I got pregnant, too--about
dialog: a year ago.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I've been through this.
text: Rose Rose looks down.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: You ain't been through what I been
dialog: through, Candy.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (doesn't get it)
dialog: Yes, I *have*!
text: Rose Rose dismissively waves her hand.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Who's the father, Rose?
text: Rose looks at Candy and shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: You want to have the baby?
text: Rose Rose shakes her head again, more emphatically.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: I know where you can go. Homer and I
dialog: can take you...
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: I can't go nowhere.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Why?
text: Rose Rose stays silent.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Is it the father? Does he know?
text: Rose Rose turns away from Candy.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's
dialog: not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it
dialog: Muddy?
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: (almost wistfully)
dialog: No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
text: Rose Rose stops; she can't even continue setting the table.
text: Her voice turns bitter, despairing.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: It sure ain't Jack.
text: There, suddenly, is Mr. Rose, walking past them. He is
text: uncharacteristically tentative.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: (to his daughter)
dialog: I'll be up top...
text: Mr. Rose leaves Candy and Rose Rose alone again. Rose Rose
text: nods almost invisibly after her father. Rose Rose looks
text: pointedly at Candy, nodding. Candy slowly gets it. Mr. Rose
text: is the father! Rose Rose lets that sink in; she keeps looking
text: at Candy with an ashamed expression.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARD - DAY
text: The pickers are at work, on their ladders, when Candy runs
text: down the aisle between two rows of trees. She stops at the
text: bottom of Homer's ladder, out of breath. Muddy and Peaches
text: and Hero, in the treetops, are watching and listening.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: She won't go to St. Cloud's!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Well, we can't force her. It's her
dialog: decision.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: You don't understand! It's her
dialog: father...
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Mr. Rose *knows*?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: He's the *father*! He's her baby's
dialog: father!
text: The pickers can't help but hear this, too. Candy starts to
text: leave, Homer running after her.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: We've got to keep her away from that
dialog: bastard!
text: Candy leaves. Homer starts looking for Mr. Rose.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARD, NEAR CIDER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Smiling his enigmatic smile, Mr. Rose keeps slowly picking
text: while Homer stands at the foot of his ladder.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: I didn't see where you was pickin'
dialog: this mornin', Homer, but you musta
dialog: worked up a big appetite. You look
dialog: like you're serious about gettin' to
dialog: your lunch today!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Is it true?
text: Mr. Rose stops picking, his eyes darting to see who's around.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Are you sleeping with your own
dialog: daughter?
text: Mr. Rose, with deliberate slowness, comes down the ladder.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: (slyly; still composed)
dialog: I think you been stayin' up too late
text: at night, Homer.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You're actually having sex with your
dialog: own little girl? Is that possible?
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my
dialog: little girl, Homer--that's somethin'
dialog: a father knows.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You're lying. How can you... with
dialog: your own daughter!
text: Mr. Rose switches from sly to threatening in a split second.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Homer, don't you know what business
dialog: you in? You don't wanna go into no
dialog: business with me, Homer--ain't that
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other
dialog: clothes.
text: Mr. Rose is indignant.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You a fine one to be talkin' about
dialog: lies. Shame! These people took you
dialog: in. That boy Wally's at *war*!
text: That takes some of the steam out of Homer's superiority.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: But she's your *daughter*...
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: And I *love* her! There ain't nobody
dialog: else gonna treat her as good as I
dialog: do!
dialog: (looks away)
dialog: I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her,
dialog: Homer--you must know that.
text: Homer turns; he speaks over his shoulder as he walks away.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: She's *pregnant*. Do you know *that*?
text: By his expression--he looks as if he's been punched--it's
dialog: clear that Mr. Rose didn't *know that*.
text: The other pickers are on their way to lunch; it's obvious
text: that Muddy, Peaches, and Hero already know that Mr. Rose is
text: sleeping with his daughter.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - PICNIC AREA - LUNCHTIME
text: Rose Rose is sitting at the picnic table when the pickers
text: arrive for lunch, almost simultaneously with Homer. He looks
text: at, then looks away from, Rose Rose. Mr. Rose is the last to
text: sit down at the table as a very tense, wordless lunch begins.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARD - DAY
text: Homer is on a ladder picking apples. Muddy climbs a ladder
text: on the other side of the same tree.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Don't mess in this, Homer, if you
dialog: know what's good for you.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: How long's this been going on, Muddy?
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Long enough. You ain't gonna stop
dialog: it.
text: Muddy looks all around for Mr. Rose; then he gives Homer his
dialog: knife.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: There's my knife, Homer. It ain't
dialog: gonna do *me* no good. You give that
dialog: knife to Rose Rose, you hear?
text: Homer nods, pocketing the knife. As Muddy climbs down and
text: moves his ladder to an adjacent tree, he keeps talking to
text: Homer until he disappears in the leaves.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: You best just watch you ass, Homer!
dialog: You don't wanna end up like Jack!
text: Homer thoughtfully continues his work.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT
text: Homer lies awake in his bed.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARD - LATE AFTERNOON, ANOTHER DAY
text: The pickers on their ladders in the trees; nobody is talking.
text: In the late sun, the leaves have a reddish, fiery glow.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARD - ANOTHER DAY
text: It's much colder; the pickers are on their ladders in the
text: trees again, but they're dressed for the cold. Homer is high
text: on a ladder; he turns toward the view of the Worthington
text: house when he hears a car come to a screeching halt in the
text: driveway. Homer sees Candy get out of Wally's car; she leaves
text: the door open and runs toward the house. Parked in front of
text: Wally's car is an Army Jeep, with an ENLISTED MAN leaning
text: against it. The indifferent soldier smokes a cigarette as he
text: watches Candy run.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: No! No!
text: Homer descends the ladder and runs for the house, down as
text: aisle between the row of trees. The pickers watch him run.
scene_heading: INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

text: the front hall, he sees Olive and Candy (in profile) sitting
text: on the couch. We can't see who's talking, nor do we recognize
text: the voice. As Homer comes into the living room, we see MAJOR
text: WINSLOW sitting in a chair (also in profile), talking to
dialog: Olive and Candy.
text: Major Winslow is a smooth, handsome well-briefed officer in
dialog: the casualty branch of the Army Air Corps; he's done his
text: homework, but he's not all business. He's painfully aware of
dialog: the delicate nature of his report.
speaker_heading: MAJOR WINSLOW
dialog: When the plane was hit, the crew
dialog: chief and the radioman jumped close
text: together. The copilot jumped third.
dialog: All on Captain Worthington's orders--
text: the captain was still flying the
text: plane. None of the men of the ground
dialog: could see the sky--that's how thick
dialog: the jungle was. They never saw the
dialog: plane crash--they never *heard* it
dialog: crash. They never saw Captain
text: Worthington's parachute, either.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Why was he missing for twenty days?
speaker_heading: MAJOR WINSLOW
dialog: Because the crew thought he'd gone
text: down with the plane. They were
text: hospitalized for almost a week in
dialog: China before they were flown back to
dialog: India. It wasn't until that they
dialog: sorted through their gear...
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Who cares about their *gear*?
speaker_heading: MAJOR WINSLOW
text: Three men jumped from the plane, but
text: they had four compasses with them.
dialog: One of the crew jumped with Captain
text: Worthington's compass.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: He was in Burma for twenty days
dialog: without a compass?
speaker_heading: MAJOR WINSLOW
dialog: He followed the Irrawaddy River, all
text: the way to Rangoon. Somehow he managed
dialog: to avoid the Japs, but not the
dialog: mosquitoes.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Then it's malaria?
speaker_heading: MAJOR WINSLOW
text: It's encephalitis B. He's recovering
dialog: at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Uh... Captain Worthington is
dialog: paralyzed.
dialog: (Olive gasps)
text: Waist down. He won't walk.
text: Candy stands and leaves the room.
speaker_heading: MAJOR WINSLOW
dialog: (to Olive)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (asks the major)
dialog: There are no autonomic effects, are
dialog: there?
text: Major Winslow has to consult his notes.
speaker_heading: MAJOR WINSLOW
dialog: No autonomic effects... that's
dialog: correct.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: When will he be home, Major?
speaker_heading: MAJOR WINSLOW
dialog: Four weeks or so, right around
dialog: Halloween.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. WALLY'S CAR - LOBSTER POUND - END OF DAY
text: Homer and Candy are sitting in the parked car in silence.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (finally)
dialog: There are no autonomic effects, just
dialog: the paralysis of the lower
dialog: extremities.
text: Candy stares at him, uncomprehending.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Wally can have kids, a normal sex
dialog: life...
text: Candy cries.
scene_heading: EXT. LOBSTER POUND - EVENING
text: Ray is throwing snails in the water. Candy sits on the end
text: of the dock, slumped on Homer's shoulder.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: How about him not needin' the friggin'
dialog: compass! How about that?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Daddy, *please*...
text: Ray knows that she wants him to leave. He shuffles off the
text: dock, toward the house. He knows how they both must feel.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Good night, kids. Don't catch cold--
dialog: it's gettin' cold already.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Good night, Daddy.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Good night, Ray.
text: Homer tries to cuddle closer, but Candy sits up, preoccupied.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Just tell me. I'll do whatever you
dialog: want to do.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally
dialog: to come home. I'm afraid to see him,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I know.
dialog: (he kisses her)
dialog: Is *that* nothing.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: No, don't--that's something. Nothing
dialog: is nothing.
dialog: (Homer's sad smile)
dialog: Don't even look at me. I want...
text: Candy buries her face in his chest.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: ...to do nothing.
text: Homer holds her, doing nothing, while she sobs. As her crying
text: subsides, Homer's thoughts are far away. With Candy slumped
text: against him, hugging him, he doesn't look at her; instead,
text: he looks out to sea and at the darkening coast, Candy's words
text: resonating. An unfamiliar expression is on his face.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (mumbling to himself)
dialog: It's a tempting idea, I know... to
dialog: do nothing.
text: Candy is silent. Homer feels strangely agitated; he shifts
dialog: his position.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (groans)
dialog: Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (overly genuine)
dialog: *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That
dialog: would be *doing* something, wouldn't
dialog: it? We wouldn't want to *do*
dialog: something. Let's just sit here all
dialog: night!
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (irritated, too)
dialog: I'm not trying to be anything--I'm
dialog: just doing nothing! If I wait and
dialog: see long enough, then--with any luck--
dialog: I won't *ever* have to make up my
dialog: mind! Decisions can be painful, after
dialog: all...
text: Candy is angry; she gets to her feet and stares hard at him.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Stop it! Just cut it out!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (mock surprise)
dialog: You got up! You *did* something! If
dialog: you keep this up, you might be in
dialog: danger of making a *decision*!
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been
dialog: shot down!
text: Candy sobs. Homer puts his face in his hands for a minute.
text: He regains his composure and stands up.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (genuinely contrite)
dialog: I know, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (yelling and sobbing)
dialog: He's *paralyzed*!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (deadpan; just the
dialog: facts)
dialog: He's *alive*. He still loves you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So do I.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: (anguished)
dialog: What do you want me to *do*?
text: He faces away from her.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (with calm resolve)
dialog: Nothing. You're not the one who has
dialog: to do anything.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Homer is in semidarkness as he walks toward the cider house.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE (O.S.)
dialog: Where do you think you're going?
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE (O.S.)
dialog: You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
text: Homer walks faster. When he gets to the cider house, he sees
text: Mr. Rose and Rose Rose arguing. Rose is sitting on the
text: bicycle, a bundle of her clothes tied up behind the seat.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle
dialog: of the night, girl!
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: I ain't your business no more, Daddy.
dialog: Please let me go.
text: Rose Rose starts to pedal away, but Mr. Rose stops her. She
text: starts to struggle.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Hey, hey! Stop it. Maybe I can help.
text: They turn to see Homer.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You just go inside, Homer. We don't
dialog: need no help.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: That's right, Homer. This ain't your
dialog: business.
text: She tries to break free from her father and pedal away, but
text: he stops her again. They keep struggling.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You forget yourself, Homer. This
dialog: here's my daughter! You got your own
dialog: mess to deal with--ain't that right?
text: Homer steps between them, which makes Mr. Rose furious.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: What business is you in, Homer?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor*
dialog: business.
dialog: (to Rose Rose)
dialog: If you want, I can help you. You
dialog: don't have to go anywhere.
text: Rose Rose and Mr. Rose stop struggling. Suddenly Homer is in
dialog: charge.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Muddy, Hero and Peaches smoke in their beds. Rose Rose opens
text: her curtain and peers out from her bed. She gets up and goes
text: toward the kitchen area in her nightshirt; she stops at an
text: unused bed, now covered with white rubber sheeting--Homer's
text: medical instruments are displayed and ready. Homer finished
text: scrubbing his hands in the sink. His surgical mask is loosely
text: tied around his neck.
text: Mr. Rose is looking at Homer's surgical instruments when
text: Rose Rose joins him.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: What's that? What's it called?
speaker_heading: HOMER
text: One cervical stabilizer, two sets of
dialog: dilators--Douglas points. One medium-
dialog: sized curette, one small; one medium
dialog: speculum, one large; two vulsellum
dialog: forceps.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: There ain't no *almost* about this
dialog: stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
text: Homer ignores him; he keeps naming his equipment.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads,
dialog: gauze--lots of gauze.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: When it comes to this, you is the
dialog: real thing--is that what you sayin'?
text: Homer looks at Mr. Rose and Rose Rose.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: No *almost* about it--I'm a doctor.
text: Homer turns to Peaches, Hero, and Muddy.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Get out of here, please.
text: Muddy herds Peaches and Hero out of the bunkhouse.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: I'm stayin', Homer.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Okay. Then you can be of use.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Mr. Rose wears a surgical mask; he is sweating, even in the
text: cold, and his eyes look stricken as he watches Homer, who is
text: performing the abortion. Mr. Rose holds the ether cone over
text: Rose Rose's face. He drips some ether from the bottle on the
dialog: cone.
text: Cut quickly for Rose Rose's etherized face... to Mr. Rose's
text: eyes above his mask... to Homer working with his eyes trained
dialog: on the speculum...
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT
text: ...to Muddy and Peaches and Hero huddled under the overhanging
text: roof in the rain.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Mr. Rose is having a hard time breathing.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You better get some air.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The cider house in the rain. Mr. Rose staggers out; he stands
text: there in the rain, trying to regain his composure. He starts
text: to scream.
text: Another angle: huddled under the overhanging roof, Muddy and
text: Peaches and Hero are watching him.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - RAINY DAY
text: Rose Rose, curled in a fetal position, listens to the rain
text: on the roof. Candy sits on her bed beside her. She helps her
text: to sit up, to drink a glass of water; then Rose Rose lies
text: down again. Rose Rose's expression never changes while Candy
text: talks to her. Mr. Rose lies in his bed in the exact same
text: fetal position as his daughter; he too, is listening to Candy.
text: Homer is putting away his instruments.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: The bleeding should taper off
dialog: tomorrow, but it can come back again.
dialog: The cramps will ease up, almost
dialog: entirely. The bleeding is usually
text: much lighter in two days. As long as
text: the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
text: Muddy enters the cider house from out of the storm. He glances
text: at Candy and Rose Rose; then at Homer. Then he speaks to Mr.
dialog: Rose.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: It's that Vernon--he keeps askin'
dialog: where you and Homer and Rose Rose is
dialog: at.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Tell that Vernon to mind his own
dialog: business, Muddy.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: I told him that you all is sick.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you*
dialog: is the crew boss today.
text: Hero and Peaches, dripping wet, come inside. Peaches is
text: standing next to the list of rules tacked to the kitchen
text: support beam.
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: Look at that. Them same damn rules
dialog: is tacked up again!
text: Homer has finished putting his instruments away.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Why don't you put them damn rules in
dialog: the wood stove, Peaches?
text: As the men are murmuring their approval of this idea, Rose
text: Rose interjects.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: I want to hear what they are, first.
text: The men groan, but Mr. Rose won't oppose his daughter on
text: this subject--not this time. He just lies there.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: Homer, let me hear what they are.
text: Homer begins to read.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: "One: Please don't smoke in bed."
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: We heard that one already, Homer.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: "Two: Please don't go up to the roof
dialog: to eat your lunch."
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: That's the best place to eat lunch!
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: "Three: Please--even if you are very
dialog: hot--do not go up to the roof to
dialog: sleep."
speaker_heading: HERO
dialog: What do they think? They must think
dialog: we're crazy!
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: They think we're dumb niggers so we
dialog: need dumb rules--that's what they
dialog: think.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: This is the last one.
text: The men groan, in mock disappointment.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: "Four: There should be no going up
dialog: on the roof at night."
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: Why don't they just say, "Stay off
dialog: the roof!"?
speaker_heading: HERO
dialog: Yeah, they don't want us up there
dialog: *at all*!
text: Homer crumples the list and throws it into the wood stove.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: (to Homer)
dialog: That's *it*?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: ROSE ROSE
dialog: It means nothin' at all! And all
dialog: this time I been *wonderin'* about
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: They're *outrageous*, them rules!
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Who *live* here in this cider house,
dialog: Peaches? Who grind them apples, who
dialog: press that cider, who clean up the
dialog: mess, and who just plain *live*
dialog: here... just breathin' in the vinegar?
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: Somebody who *don't* live here made
dialog: them rules. Them rules ain't for
dialog: *us*. *We* the ones who make up them
dialog: rules. We makin' our *own* rules,
dialog: every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Right.
text: Camera closes on Candy.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. WALLY'S CAR - DRIVE-IN THEATRE - EVENING
text: Homer and Candy sit and stare at the blank screen; they don't
text: look at each other. Candy grips the steering wheel of the
text: parked car.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Please don't make me say it again.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: No, that's not it--I just want to be
dialog: sure I understand you.
text: Candy slumps forward with her forehead on the steering wheel.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I *helped* you not to think about
dialog: Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't
dialog: stand worrying about him, about his
dialog: being killed and not coming back--
dialog: but when you were with me, you could
dialog: stop worrying... well, for a while,
dialog: anyway. This is how I helped you,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Please... that's enough. I *loved*
dialog: you, too--you know I did.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: "...did." Well, okay.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Please don't...
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: And now that Wally's coming back,
dialog: and because he'll certainly *need*
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: You say that as though it's some
dialog: awful thing!
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: I never stopped loving Wally!
text: Homer lets that sink in.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (still sarcastic)
text: At least there's no more waiting and
dialog: seeing. At least I got to see the
dialog: ocean.
text: Candy covers her face in her hands and cries uncontrollably,
text: unstoppably. Homer's anger keeps him impervious to her tears--
text: another "first" for him. He turns and looks at her with an
text: almost clinical curiosity; then he goes back to staring at
text: the blank screen.
scene_heading: EXT. ORCHARD - IN FRONT OF THE APPLE MART - DAWN
text: The rain has stopped but the grass is wet, the trees
text: glistening in the dawn light as Wally's car stops and Homer
text: gets out. The car exits the frame in one direction; Homer,
text: walking, exits the frame in another.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAWN
text: As he walks toward the cider house, Homer sees Muddy and
text: Peaches and Hero waving to him from the roof.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Rose Rose has runned away!
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: She took off in the night!
speaker_heading: MUDDY
text: She took off on the bicycle, man.
text: Homer starts jogging, then running toward the cider house.
text: Muddy comes down the ladder to meet him.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - EARLY MORNING
text: Rose Rose's bed is exposed. The curtains are flung open; her
text: bed is empty. Mr. Rose is still in his bed, in the fetal
text: position we have seen before. Mr. Rose's trancelike expression
text: doesn't change as Homer and Muddy enter.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Ain't nobody gonna find her, Homer--
text: she's long gone.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I swear, I didn't try and stop her--
dialog: I just wanna touch her hand before
dialog: she go. That's all I wanna do, I
dialog: swear.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Where'd she get that knife, Muddy?
dialog: That looked like *your* knife--what
dialog: I seen of it.
text: Muddy is scared; he looks to Homer for advice.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: If that was your knife, Muddy, I
dialog: wanna thank you for givin' it to her--
dialog: no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'*
dialog: if she don't got a good knife with
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (seeing the blood)
dialog: Where'd she get you?
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: She just plan misunderstand me--I
dialog: was tryin' to give her my knife, I
text: was just reachin' to touch her hand.
dialog: But I understand if she misunderstand
dialog: me--it's all my fault, ain't that
dialog: right?
text: Homer takes the blanket off him; Muddy gasps. Homer tries to
text: examine Mr. Rose's wound. Mr. Rose smiles at him.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: It's too late for the doctor now,
dialog: Homer--ain't that right?
text: Homer doesn't answer; he knows Mr. Rose is a goner.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: She's *good* with that knife! She's
dialog: real fast. She's a lot better with
dialog: that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And
dialog: who do you suppose taught her?
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: *You* taught her, I suppose...
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: That's right! A girl's gotta know
dialog: how to defend herself, don't she?
text: He winces in pain at Homer's examination.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: There's more than one laceration,
dialog: more than one cut.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: That's 'cause I sticked my *own*
dialog: knife in the wound--after she go, I
dialog: sticked my *own* knife in there. I
dialog: poked it all around, I just tryin'
dialog: to find the same place she got me.
text: Homer finds Mr. Rose's knife. There's blood everywhere.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: You listen to me: you tell them police
dialog: how this happen, you tell it *this*
dialog: way, you hear? My daughter, she runned
dialog: off--and I so sad about it that I
dialog: stabbed myself. I so unhappy that
dialog: she gone, I killed myself--that what
dialog: you say, you hear? That the true
dialog: story--ain't that right?
text: Homer and Muddy exchange a glance. Mr. Rose, with his blood-
text: soaked hand, suddenly grabs Homer by the throat.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy
dialog: she runned away that I killed myself--
dialog: that what happen here, ain't that
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: That what happen--you lost you only
dialog: daughter so's you killed yourself!
dialog: That's what we say, all right.
speaker_heading: MR. ROSE
dialog: That's right. I know you understand
dialog: how I feel, Homer--you is breakin'
dialog: them rules, too. Ain't that right?
text: Mr. Rose dies. Muddy turns away. Homer closes Mr. Rose's
text: eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. CIDER HOUSE, ROOF - MORNING
text: Muddy and Hero and Peaches are sitting close together on the
text: roof, like banished children. It is from their perspective
text: that we see the police car and the ambulance--two men carrying
text: the body out of the cider house, and a cop or two talking to
text: Homer and Olive, and Homer talking to them. We hear no
dialog: dialogue.
scene_heading: EXT. APPLE MART - DUSK
text: Homer and the men load crates of apple jelly onto a truck.
text: The mood is solemn; they work with tired focus. Candy drives
text: up. The men are evasive with her; they find a reason to work
text: across the mart. Candy walks to Homer, stands next to him.
text: They say nothing for a moment, until Candy breaks the silence.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Do you think she'll be all right?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: She knows how to take care of herself.
text: Candy looks away; she can't think of what to say. She shoves
text: her hands into her pockets, finds a letter there, which she
text: hands to Homer.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: This came for you a couple of days
dialog: ago. Olive asked me to bring it.
dialog: With everything happening, I guess
dialog: she forgot.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Sure. Thanks.
text: Homer looks at the letter from St. Cloud's; he puts it
text: unopened in his pocket without a second thought. Candy can't
dialog: let things end there.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: I know you don't think much of being
dialog: needed, or of me for that matter...
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: I'm sorry for what I said about Wally
dialog: needing you. It was... unnecessary.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: No, I'm the one who should be sorry.
dialog: You have every right to be angry.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: No. You warned me. I didn't listen,
dialog: but you warned me.
text: Candy looks surprised.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You told me you weren't any good at
dialog: being alone.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You told Wally, too. Right?
text: Candy can only stare straight ahead.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: (relenting)
dialog: He's going to be fine, Wally's going
dialog: to be fine. I know he is.
text: A tear rolls down Candy's cheek, Homer wipes it away; then
text: he stops touching her and looks off into the quiet orchards.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The pickers lie in their beds, smoking. Homer is undressing.
text: He pulls the letter out of his pocket and sits down on his
text: bed. Homer opens the letter without enthusiasm and begins to
dialog: read.
speaker_heading: ANGELA (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Homer, I am writing to tell you
dialog: about Wilbur.
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT
text: Music is playing on the old phonograph as an exhausted Larch
dialog: gives himself ether.
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT
text: Edna is getting the girls ready for bed. Music continues
dialog: Over.
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT
text: Larch has twisted himself on the narrow bed so that his face
text: is unusually close to the windowsill, and when the ether
text: cone starts to fall off his face--and his slack hand trails
text: down, off the side of the bed--the cone becomes caught against
text: the windowsill.
text: He tries to turn his face away from the cone, but he presses
text: his face into the sill--thus holding the ether-soaked cone
text: over his mouth and nose. His hands twitch, he's trying to
text: wake up; the hand that holds the ether bottle lets the bottle
text: fall. The bottle shatters against the sill; the ether spreads,
text: running red with blood from a cut on Dr. Larch's hand or
text: finger. Music continues Over. It's a funeral.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Buster is bringing in the wood as the music plays Over. Buster
text: smells the spilled ether. He heads toward the dispensary,
text: sniffing. Camera follows him into the dispensary.
text: In the dispensary: Buster approaches Larch's ether-bed.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: Dr. Larch? Dr. Larch?
text: He drops the armload of wood and runs for help.
scene_heading: INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT
text: Angela enters. She feels for Larch's pulse; Larch is dead.
text: Angela opens a window. She pull's Larch's body away from the
text: windowsill. Buster joins her on the bed.
speaker_heading: ANGELA (V.O.)
dialog: I can assure you that the overdose
dialog: was entirely accidental.
scene_heading: INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Homer finishes reading the letter; he puts it down, gets up,
text: and walks to a window. He stares into the night.
speaker_heading: ANGELA (V.O.)
dialog: Let us be happy for Dr. Larch. Dr.
text: Larch has found a family.
speaker_heading: THE BOYS (V.O.)
dialog: Good night, Dr. Larch! Good night,
dialog: Dr. Larch! Good night, Dr. Larch!
text: Homer wipes a tear off his cheek.
scene_heading: EXT. PICKERS' TRUCK - CIDER/PACKING HOUSE - MORNING
text: The truck is packed for the long trip south; it passes by
text: the packing house, which looks closed for the season. No one
text: else is about. Muddy is driving slowly, his arm out the open
text: window. In the back, huddled among their belongings, are
text: Peaches and Hero (on one side) and Homer (on the other). The
text: pickers are trying to draw Homer into their conversation,
text: while Homer is giving the apple farm a good-bye look. He has
dialog: made up his mind about something.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: He ain't never been outta Maine!
speaker_heading: HERO
dialog: Ain't you sick of pine trees, Homer?
text: Homer just smiles and shakes his head.
scene_heading: EXT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - MORNING
text: As the pickers' truck drives past, Homer is on the side of
text: the truck nearest the Worthington house and driveway; he
text: sees Olive and Candy and Ray helping Wally out of the car
text: and into a wheelchair. A NURSE stands by.
text: Wally is wearing what appears to be an oversized officer's
text: coat or flight jacket, his face looking small in the overlarge
text: clothes. He can't move his legs at all, and his mouth is
text: drawn into a tight-lipped smile.
speaker_heading: PEACHES (O.S.)
dialog: Let me tell you somethin' about
dialog: Florida, Homer.
speaker_heading: HERO (O.S.)
dialog: The Sunshine State!
speaker_heading: PEACHES (O.S.)
dialog: It's so nice 'n' warm down there,
dialog: you can pick them grapefruits and
dialog: oranges *naked*, if you want to.
text: Olive is dissolved in tears. Candy is sobbing; she kisses
text: Wally, without ceasing, while he haltingly touches her face,
dialog: her hair.
text: In the truck the smile is gone from Homer's face. He shakes
text: his head.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with
dialog: you. But I've got to move on.
speaker_heading: MUDDY
dialog: Yeah, well... you could move on with
dialog: *us*, man! You could move on somewhere
dialog: *warm*!
speaker_heading: PEACHES
dialog: Homer, stayin' in Maine ain't movin'
dialog: on!
text: This makes all the pickers laugh, but Homer just smiles and
text: shakes his head. He watches the Worthington house disappear
dialog: from view.
scene_heading: INT. MOVING TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT
text: A CONDUCTOR, taking tickets, comes to Homer, who is better
text: dressed than we've ever seen him; he is looking at his sober
text: reflection in the black window-glass of the night train when
text: the conductor gets his attention. When the conductor moves
text: on, Homer takes Angela's letter out of his breast pocket; he
text: skips ahead to the end.
speaker_heading: ANGELA (V.O.)
dialog: Dr. Larch often wondered how the
dialog: world was treating you.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - GRAVEYARD - AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: ANGELA (V.O.)
dialog: He talked a lot about you, hoping
dialog: you would be of use, whatever you
dialog: were up to.
text: Angela and Buster and Mary Agnes and Edna carry Larch's
text: coffin; they set it down by the raw hole. The pile of fresh
text: dirt stands out against the new snow; the hole is black
dialog: against the new white.
speaker_heading: EDNA (O.S.)
dialog: "Oh, Lord, support us all the day
dialog: long..."
text: We see the wheelbarrow with the gravestone.
speaker_heading: EDNA (O.S.)
dialog: "...until the shadows lengthen and
text: the evening comes, and the busy world
text: is hushed, and the fever of life is
dialog: over, and our work is done."
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT
text: We see the faces of the girls praying for Larch (Mary Agnes,
text: too) as Edna finishes her favorite prayer.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: "Then, in Thy mercy grant us a safe
dialog: lodging, and a holy rest, and peace
dialog: at the last."
scene_heading: INT. MOVING TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT
text: Camera closes on Homer, sleeping to the sound of the rocking
text: train. Angela's letter lies in his lap.
speaker_heading: THE GIRLS (O.S.)
dialog: Amen! Amen! Amen!
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - EARLY MORNING
text: The train stops, blowing snow. Homer steps off the train
text: carrying a suitcase and Dr. Larch's bag. The disapproving
text: stationmaster is still disapproving. Music plays Over,
text: something triumphant.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - THE HILL - EARLY MORNING
text: Homer makes his way up the hill toward the orphanage. Music
dialog: Over.
scene_heading: EXT. ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING
text: Edna is breaking up fights; this time, instead of fighting
text: over snowballs, the orphans are fighting over their pumpkins.
text: Suddenly Homer tops the brow of the hill and they all see
text: him. Buster is the first to catch sight of Homer; he runs
text: toward him. Mary Agnes also sees Homer; she immediately turns
text: away and runs inside. Music FADES OUT Over.
scene_heading: INT. LAVATORY - EARLY MORNING
text: Mary Agnes crashes into the bathroom and stumbles up to the
text: mirror; she starts to fix herself up with shaking hands.
scene_heading: INT. ORPHANAGE, FRONT HALL - EARLY MORNING
text: Everyone has heard the news; they come on the run. The
text: children flock around Homer, hugging him. Homer takes Angela
text: and Edna in his arms. Mary Agnes joins the group. Homer takes
text: in how changed, how attractive she is. They smile awkwardly
text: at each other.
scene_heading: INT. BOYS' DIVISION - EVENING
text: Homer's suitcase is open on the bed; we see Homer's hands as
text: he begins to unpack. Smaller hands reach in and root through
dialog: the clothes.
speaker_heading: CURLY (O.S.)
dialog: Did you bring something for me?
text: Curly continues his search. Homer thinks for a second; then
text: reaches into his pocket and pulls out the piece of pale-green
dialog: glass.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: You know what? I did.
text: Homer hands the piece of glass to Curly.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: It's from the ocean. It's for you.
text: Curly is duly impressed; he walks away to examine his new
text: treasure. Homer continues unpacking. He pulls his X ray out
text: and puts it aside.
speaker_heading: BUSTER
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: Homer turns to see Buster, Mary Agnes, Angela, and Edna in
text: the doorway.
speaker_heading: MARY AGNES
dialog: We made up a room for you.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Wouldn't you be more comfortable by
dialog: yourself?
text: Homer smiles; he nods.
text: Angela and Mary Agnes start to put Homer's things back in
text: his bag. Edna picks up the X ray and looks at it with a somber
dialog: expression.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Homer, do you know what this is?
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Sure. It's my heart.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Actually, it's Fuzzy's. There's
dialog: nothing wrong with your heart.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Fuzzy's?!
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Dr. Larch wanted to keep you out of
dialog: the war, Homer--that's why he did
dialog: it. That's why he told you it was
dialog: yours.
text: Homer is stunned; he puts his hand to his heart.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: I think he worried about his own
dialog: heart. He said it would never stand
text: up to Homer Wells going off to war.
text: Homer takes that in; he nods. Mary Agnes touches him
text: sympathetically.
scene_heading: INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Homer looks at his fake diplomas; they are now framed and
text: hanging on the office wall. Homer surveys the office, as if
text: for the first time; he sits down in the desk chair, as if
text: slowly getting used to his new position.
scene_heading: INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT
text: Homer reads to the boys from "David Copperfield". While his
text: voice is strong--positive, optimistic, certainly reassuring
text: to the boys--there is in the conclusion of the chapter
text: something that distracts him. He seems to hesitate; he misses
text: a line or two, and perhaps he purposely skips one or two
text: others. (Possibly Homer's eyes wander ahead, to the title of
text: the next chapter: "I Make Another Beginning.")
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: "Thus I began my new life, in a new
dialog: name, and with everything new about
dialog: me... I felt... like one in a dream...
dialog: The remembrance of that life is
dialog: fraught with so much... want of
dialog: hope... Whether it lasted for a year,
dialog: or more, or less, I do not know. I
dialog: only know that it was, and ceased to
dialog: be; and... there I leave it."
text: Homer stops and looks at the boys' faces.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: What happens next?
text: Homer smiles.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: That's tomorrow, Curly. Let's mot
dialog: give the story away.
text: Homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar
text: semi-darkness. Seconds, later, the closed door to the hall
text: is flung open, flooding the room with light from the hall,
text: and Homer, dressed in his long white laboratory coat and
text: looking every inch the doctor, delivers his best imitation
dialog: of Larch's popular blessing.
speaker_heading: HOMER
dialog: Good night, you Princes of Maine!
dialog: You Kings of New England!
text: On Copperfield and Steerforth and Curly as the door to the
text: hall is closed and semi-darkness prevails in the room again.
text: Copperfield, smiling, shuts his eyes. After a second, the
text: wide-eyed Steerforth shuts his eyes, too. Then Curly.
text: The last to close his eyes is Buster.
