scene_heading: EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL INTERPLANETARY SPACE
text: A vast field of stars. The gas giant Neptune slowly spins
text: into view. Brilliant and blue and cold against the void.
scene_heading: EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL A BLACK SILHOUETTE
text: stands out against the planet, tiny against Neptune's scale.
scene_heading: EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL DRIFT CLOSER
text: to discern the hard angles of a man-made craft. A ship. No
text: longer dwarfed by the planet, the scale of the vessel emerges:
text: a vast labyrinth of steel.
text: Its shadow swallows all in darkness.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY
text: Shafts of Neptune's blue light enter through windows,
text: illuminate debris suspended in the zero-gravity environment:
text: shards of metal and glass.
dialog: MOVE from the Corridor into:
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
text: A cockpit for three. Neptune's blue light fills the chamber,
text: reflects off immobile particles in the air. Thick quartz
text: windows look down at Neptune. The cockpit lights are dark
text: but for one blinking red light.
text: An emergency beacon. Under-floor lights go on.
text: The strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the
text: helm, slowly spinning. He is dead, perfectly preserved in
text: the cold vacuum of space. His eyes are empty black pits and
text: his mouth hangs open in a scream: DR. WILLIAM WEIR.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT
text: Weir opens his eyes, waking from dream. Sweat beads his
text: ascetic, etched face. Many years a scientist.
text: He turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment.
dialog: Decorated by a woman, but Weir is alone, unless you count
text: photographs. His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful
dialog: woman.
text: Weir reaches to the stand. Picks up...
scene_heading: RECENT, UNFRAMED PHOTO
text: The woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave
dialog: smile.
text: Weir lies back on the bed. Looks at the photo. Presses it to
text: his forehead and closes his eyes. Trying to be with her,
dialog: just one more time.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: I miss you.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER
text: Weir stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving with a
text: straight-razor. The mirror reveals the bathtub just behind
dialog: him. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP...
text: Weir turns to stare at the bathtub. Water wells up at the
text: mouth of the tub's faucet, grows impossibly large, falls...
speaker_heading: DRIP.
text: Weir turns back to his shaving.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER
text: Weir stands in the kitchenette, staring at the microwave as
text: it cooks his breakfast.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER
text: Weir stands before his window, chewing his oatmeal
text: mechanically, forcing himself to swallow. He reaches out to
dialog: open the blinds...
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT REVERSE ANGLE
text: as the blinds pull aside, revealing Weir, upside-down.
text: ROTATE AND PULL BACK...
scene_heading: EXT. DAYLIGHT STATION - MODEL TO REVEAL DAYLIGHT STATION
text: Weir's window is just one of many in a space station, a
text: delicate combination of cylindrical habitats and solar panels.
text: The structure hangs above the Earth in low orbit.

text: A videophone RINGS OS...
speaker_heading: WEIR (V.O.)
dialog: This is Weir.
speaker_heading: LYLE (V.O.)
dialog: (tinny)
dialog: Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like
dialog: to see you as soon as possible.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAYLIGHT - OFFICE
text: A military office, United States Aerospace Command seal
text: blazoned on the door. Views of the Earth. Admiral HOLLIS
text: sits behind his desk, a gruff career officer and a good man.
text: Weir enters, escorted by Hollis' adjutant, LYLE.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: You wanted to see me, Admiral?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: I apologize for the short notice,
dialog: Bill, but we've had something come
dialog: up that requires your immediate
dialog: attention. Lyle?
scene_heading: INT. HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
text: Lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system. A
text: box magnifies the eighth planet, Neptune, revealing a flashing
text: red dot in its orbit.
scene_heading: INT. DAYLIGHT OFFICE
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: At oh-three-hundred this morning,
text: TDRSS picked up an automated
text: navigation beacon broadcasting at
text: two minute intervals in Neptune orbit.
text: Lyle hands Weir a stack of hardcopy data. Weir reads the
text: data with growing excitement.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Incredible... These are the same
dialog: coordinates before the ship
dialog: disappeared... this, this happened?
dialog: This isn't some kind of hoax?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax.
text: Houston confirms the telemetry and
dialog: I.D. codes.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: (excited)
dialog: It's the Event Horizon. She's come
dialog: back.
text: Hollis answers drily.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: That ship was lost in deep space,
dialog: seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed
dialog: into New York harbor, I'd find it
dialog: more plausible.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Houston wants Aerospace to send out
text: a search and rescue team, investigate
dialog: the source of the transmission. If
dialog: it really is the Event Horizon,
dialog: they'll attempt a salvage.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We need you to prepare a detailed
text: briefing on the ship's systems for
dialog: the salvage crew...
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: A written briefing can't possibly
dialog: anticipate the variables on a mission
dialog: like this. I have to go with them.
text: Lyle looks at Weir, stunned by the request.
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: Dr. Weir, you have no experience
dialog: with salvage procedures.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I designed the ship's propulsion
dialog: system. I am the only person capable
dialog: of evaluating the performance of the
dialog: gravity drive. You can't send a Search
dialog: and Rescue team out there alone and
dialog: expect them to succeed. That would
dialog: be like... like sending an auto-
text: mechanic to work on the shuttle.
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: I can understand your desire to redeem
dialog: your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it
dialog: doesn't factor into this.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: This is not about my reputation!
dialog: This is not about me at all!
dialog: (beat, passionate)
dialog: The Event Horizon was created for
dialog: one reason: to go faster than light.
dialog: Imagine mankind exploring new solar
text: systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven
dialog: years ago, we didn't just lose the
dialog: ship and the crew. We lost the dream.
dialog: (beat, quiet and
dialog: relentless)
dialog: I have to go.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: It's not that simple.
dialog: (off of Weir's
dialog: expression)
dialog: Lyle, play the recording for Dr.
dialog: Weir.
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: Navigation Control tried to hail the
text: vessel. This was the only response.
text: Lyle presses a button on Hollis' desk. An unholy GARBLE rips
text: from office speakers: STATIC and NOISE and INHUMAN VOICES.
dialog: Alone, each sound would raise the hair on your neck. Together,
dialog: they are unbearable.
text: The sound mercifully cuts off to STATIC. Lyle stops the tape.
text: Weir sits there, stunned.
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: Since the initial transmission,
dialog: there's been no further contact.
text: Just the beacon, every two minutes.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: The crew? Could they still be alive?
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: The ship had life support systems
dialog: for eighteen months. They're been
dialog: gone seven years.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Someone sent that message. Admiral,
dialog: you have to put me on that ship.
text: Hollis stares at Weir, judging the man with his eyes.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: It's against my better judgement,
dialog: but I'll run this by the Man
dialog: downstairs. You'll know my decision
text: by the end of the day.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing
dialog: you any favors.
text: Weir leaves. The door closes behind him.
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: You're not seriously considering
dialog: sending him?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: You don't just dismiss Bill Weir.
text: The man held Oppenheimer's chair at
dialog: Princeton. If the Event Horizon had
dialog: worked, he would have gone down in
dialog: history as the greatest mind in
dialog: physics since Einstein.
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: The official inquiry blamed Weir's
dialog: design for the ship's loss.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: That doesn't mean a damn thing. They
dialog: were looking for a scapegoat and
dialog: Weir fit the bill. But he's not
dialog: responsible for what happened to the
dialog: ship.
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: Does he know that?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: What's on your mind?
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: He doesn't belong on this mission.
text: Responsible or not, he blames himself.
text: He's too close to it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And then there's his wife.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: It's been two years since she died.
dialog: He's over it.
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: Some things you don't get over.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: I want our best people on this.
dialog: Where's Miller?
speaker_heading: LYLE
dialog: The Lewis and Clark just returned
dialog: from patrol in the asteroid belt,
text: she's docked in bay four.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DAYLIGHT STATION/EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK
text: The Lewis and Clark pulls away from Daylight station, turns
text: towards the depths of space. It is a tough-looking spacecraft,
dialog: all engine.
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
text: MOVE IN on thick quartz windows near the ship's nose: the
dialog: bridge...
text: Split level. Above: avionics, navigation, flight control.
dialog: STARCK (female, Navigator, sharp mind, sharp tongue) checks
text: the navigation data on her screen as SMITH (male, Pilot,
text: wrapped too tight) punches in the course.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I can't believe this, I haven't gotten
dialog: more than my hand in six weeks and
dialog: now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap,
dialog: Mars has women...
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: Smith's right. Neptune? There's
dialog: nothing out there. If something
dialog: happens, we'll be on our own.
text: The captain's chair drops from above, swivels to reveal MILLER
dialog: (male, Captain, intense).
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I don't like it either, but you know
dialog: the rules: we get the call, we go.
dialog: Is the course locked in?
speaker_heading: SMITH
text: Locked and cocked.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: We're past the outer marker, we can
dialog: engage the ion drive whenever you're
dialog: ready.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Justin?
text: Below: the bridge's "war-room" -- ship's systems and mission
text: stations. JUSTIN (male, Engineer, young hot-shot).
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: Everything green on my boards,
dialog: Skipper.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Start the countdown.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: Ion drive will engage in... T-minus
dialog: ten minutes.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Let's go.
text: Miller slides down a ladder into the war-room. The others
dialog: follow into...
scene_heading: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY
text: Bulky EVA (extra-vehicular activity) suits line the walls.
text: MUSIC blares from a JAMBOX, built into a storage locker.
text: An Emergency Tech stows safety lines: COOPER -- male, the
text: resident pain-in-the-ass. He SINGS along with the music.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (not breaking stride)
dialog: Kill it.
text: Cooper reaches up, turns off the box.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Time to play Spam in the can.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Don't start with me, Cooper.
text: Cooper falls in as the crew continues into...
scene_heading: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS
text: Evidence of long term habitation. Personalized lockers. Fold-
text: down bunks, chairs, tables; currently stowed for docking. A
text: modular galley.
text: PETERS (female, Emergency Technician, the crew's denmother)
text: and DJ (male, Doctor, a cold perfectionist) load CO2 scrubbers
text: into a bin in the floor.
text: Weir stands to the side like a fifth wheel.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Captain Miller, I just want to say...
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If
dialog: you'll follow the rest of the crew,
dialog: they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
text: Weir hesitates, then follows the crew into Medical. Miller
text: hangs back.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What's the hold up?
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: Just loading the last of the CO2
text: scrubbers.
dialog: (to Miller, accusatory)
dialog: Good for four months.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I put in for a replacement for you
dialog: but no one...
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: No, no, its alright. I talked to my
dialog: ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas
dialog: and I'll get him this summer.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen
dialog: him in two months.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I am sorry. But now we have to go to
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL
text: A high tech operating room. Modular equipment. Vertical tanks
text: line the walls, each large enough to hold a human being:
text: gravity couches.
text: The crew stands before the gravity couches, almost nude, no
dialog: room for modesty.
text: Starck catches Cooper looking at her ass as she strips to
text: her undergarments. Cooper grins. She flips him off, not
text: bothering to turn around.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Is that an offer?
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: It is not.
text: Miller disrobes. Two service tags hang around his neck. He
text: does not remove them. Weir approaches him.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Captain Miller, I appreciate this
dialog: opportunity...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on
dialog: your mission because we want to. We
dialog: were pulled off a well deserved leave,
dialog: to be sent out to the middle of
dialog: nowhere, and no one's even told us
dialog: why.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I've been authorized to brief you
dialog: and the crew once we reach Neptune
dialog: space.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Until then, do what you're told and
dialog: stay out of my way.
text: Weir nods, moves to an empty couch bearing his name, written
text: on a piece of tape. Peters watches him.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: First time in a grav couch?
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Yes.
text: She checks Weir's couch, helps him climb in. Weir keeps one
text: eye on Miller.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: (Off of Weir's glance)
dialog: Don't worry about it. He's hard, but
dialog: he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping
dialog: out with him. He's one of the few
dialog: Captains in the service with
dialog: experience in the Outer Reach.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: He's been past Mars?
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: He served on the Goliath.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Wasn't that ship destroyed?
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: (nods)
dialog: They attempted to rescue a supply
text: shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's
dialog: oh-two tanks ruptured during the
dialog: rescue, flooded both ships with pure
dialog: oxygen. There was a spark and both
text: ships were incinerated. The Skipper
dialog: and three others just made it to a
dialog: lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: He doesn't like to talk about it.
text: DJ swathes one of Weir's arms with alcohol.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: You didn't eat anything in the past
dialog: twelve hours?
text: Weir shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: When the Ion drive fires, we'll be
text: taking about 30 gees. Without a tank,
dialog: the force would liquefy your skeleton.
text: DJ injects Weir. The scientist winces.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I've seen the effect on mice.
text: The overhead lights change to red.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Five minutes.
text: DJ hands him the breathing mask.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Put this on.
text: Weir does. DJ checks the fit.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: You'll be fine. You'll wake up and
dialog: we'll be there. Watch your fingers.
text: DJ closes the tank. It begins to fill with green gel. Weir's
text: eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits. His
text: eyes close. His body draws into a fetal position.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: (checking the monitor)
dialog: Heart-rate decreasing... body temp
dialog: dropping to 80... 70... 60... 50...
text: 40 degrees Fahrenheit. He's in stasis.

scene_heading: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL CLOSE ON WEIR
text: immobile in the grav tank. He might be sleeping. He might be
text: dead. A distant SOUND echoes though the ship, the unholy
text: garble of human and inhuman voices -- it is the Event Horizon,
text: calling to him -- the sound refines into a WOMAN'S VOICE, no
text: more than a WHISPER:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Billy...
text: Weir opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm so cold...
text: Weir's grav tank opens.
scene_heading: WIDER TO REVEAL

text: Weir slowly walks to the Bridge.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm so cold...
scene_heading: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
text: A naked WOMAN sits at the helm, her back to us. Completely
text: still. Her skin is very pale. Water pools around her chair.
text: Weir stands behind her.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: (tentative)
dialog: Claire?
text: She does not answer. She does not move. Weir reaches out to
text: touch her shoulder, then pulls his hand back, afraid.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Claire? I'm sorry. Claire?
text: He reaches out again. He touches her hair. She doesn't move.
text: Weir catches her reflection in the computer monitors.
text: Something wrong with her face... He starts to spin her around.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm so cold...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL
text: Weir awakes with a jolt, in his grav couch. His mask has
text: slipped. His tank has filled with blood. He is drowning.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MEDICAL
text: Reality. Weir's eyes open. He presses against the glass of
text: the tank, trying to force it open, panicked. The others are
text: already stepping from open tanks.
text: Weir's tank opens with a HISS. He tumbles to the floor,
text: gasping, fluid streaming from his mouth.
text: Peters rushes to him.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Claire...
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: DJ!
dialog: (to Weir)
dialog: It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
text: Weir catches his breath. He looks up. The crew surrounds
text: him, concerned.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I'm alright now. I'm alright...
text: DJ helps him to his feet.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Move slowly. You've been in stasis
dialog: for fifty-six days. You're going to
text: experience a little disorientation.
text: Weir nods.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like
dialog: that. Coffee?
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Coffee.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: No, thank you.
text: Cooper, still butt-naked and proud of it, grabs a metal

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Hey, Starck. You wanna dry my back?
text: Starck gives him a cool once over.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: Maybe when you finish puberty.
text: Miller zips up.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: I just finished drying...
speaker_heading: MILLER

text: Justin catches the ball, holds onto it.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Okay, listen up. As you all know by

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You can call him Baby-bear, he loves

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: This is Cooper, what the hell do you
dialog: do on this ship, anyway?
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: Ballast.
speaker_heading: COOPER

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: He's a rescue technician. Peters,
dialog: medical technician. DJ...
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Trauma.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: And this is mission specialist Dr.
dialog: William Weir. We all know where we're
dialog: going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us
dialog: why.
text: Miller and the crew look at Weir, waiting. Weir clears his
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: What I am about to tell you is
dialog: considered code-black by the NSA.
text: The crew look at each other: they haven't heard that in a
dialog: mission briefing before.
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: That means top-secret, Cooper.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I heard it.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: The USAC intercepted a radio
text: transmission from a decaying orbit
dialog: around Neptune. The source has been
text: identified as the Event Horizon.
text: STUNNED SILENCE. Then everyone talks at once:
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: That's impossible! She was lost with
dialog: all hands, what, seven...
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: Seven years ago, the reactor blew...
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: How can we salvage...?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Let the dead rest, man...
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: ...cancel our leave and send us out
dialog: on some bullshit mission...!
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
text: In the quiet that follows:
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: What was made public about the Event
dialog: Horizon, that she was a deep space
dialog: research vessel, that its reactor
dialog: went critical, that the ship blew
dialog: up... None of that is true.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The Event Horizon was the culmination
dialog: of a secret government project to
dialog: create a spacecraft capable of faster-
dialog: than-light flight.
text: The crew stares at Weir: he has just dropped another bomb on
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: You can't do that.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: The law of relativity prohibits faster-
dialog: than-light travel...
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Relativity, yes. We can't break the
dialog: law of relativity, but we can go
text: around it. The ship doesn't really
dialog: move faster than the speed of light;
dialog: it creates a dimensional gateway
dialog: that allows the ship to
text: instantaneously "jump" from one point
dialog: in the universe to another, light
dialog: years away.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Well, in layman's terms, you use a
text: rotating magnetic field to focus a
text: narrow beam of gravitons; these in
dialog: turn fold space-time consistent with
dialog: Weyl tensor dynamics until the space-
text: time curvature becomes infinitely
dialog: large and you have a singularity...
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Laymen's terms.
text: Weir thinks of another way to explain it. He rips a pin-up
text: from Smith's locker.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Say this paper represents space-time,
dialog: and you want to get from "point A"
dialog: here...
text: (marks it on the photo
dialog: with a pen)
dialog: ...to "point B," here.
dialog: (marks point B)
dialog: Now: what's the shortest distance
dialog: between two points?
text: The crew stares at him. Starck decides to play.
speaker_heading: STARCK
text: A straight line.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Wrong. The shortest distance between
dialog: two points...
text: Weir folds the paper, lining up point A over point B... then
text: THRUSTING his pen through both, skewering the pin-up.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: ...is zero. That's what the
dialog: singularity does: it folds space, so
dialog: that point A and point B coexist in
dialog: the same space and time. After the
text: ship passes through this gateway,
text: space returns to normal.
dialog: (hands the ruined pin-
dialog: up back to Smith)
dialog: It's called a gravity drive.
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: How do you know all this?

speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: It was the ship's maiden voyage, to

dialog: moved to safe distance using ion

dialog: to activate the gravity drive.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And the ship vanished from all our

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: PETERS
text: It doesn't sound like anything human.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Houston has passed the recording

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: It sounds like Latin.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Latin? Who the fuck speaks Latin?
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: No one. It's a dead language.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Mostly dead.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What does it say?
speaker_heading: WEIR

speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: There: "...liberatis me..." They

speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: "Liberatis me." "Save me."
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: From what?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (to Weir)
dialog: You're convinced the crew could still
dialog: be alive? After seven years?
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: The Event Horizon only had life

speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Do they have pressure?
speaker_heading: STARCK
text: Affirmative. The hull's intact...

speaker_heading: MILLER

text: Starck frowns at her display.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Radiation interference?
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: There's not enough radiation to throw

text: on the location.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Could it be the crew? If they were

speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: If they were in stasis, I'd get a

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
text: An alcove, opening into a vast chamber. Once pristine, all

text: A lighted console blocks Justin's view of the chamber beyond.

speaker_heading: DJ

speaker_heading: MILLER

speaker_heading: MILLER

speaker_heading: STARCK

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: We can take the filters from the

speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: I thought of that, with the filters
dialog: from the Clark, we've got enough

dialog: After that, we'd better be on our

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What about the life readings you

speaker_heading: STARCK
text: The Event Horizon sensors show the

speaker_heading: MILLER

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Okay, people, there's been a change
dialog: in the mission. In less than eighteen

speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: I can use the station in Medical,

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat
dialog: the bio-scan...
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: What's the point? I'll just get the
dialog: same thing...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Not acceptable. I want to know what's
dialog: causing those readings. If the crew
dialog: is dead, I want the bodies, I want
dialog: the crew found.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: I can reconfigure the scan for C-12,
dialog: amylase proteins.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Do it. Dr. Weir...
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: One of my men is down. I want to

speaker_heading: COOPER

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You weren't there. I saw it.
speaker_heading: WEIR

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Cooper! Enough!

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (turning on Weir)
dialog: Dr. Weir, Justin may die. Whatever

dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I don't know what happened to Justin.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I'm telling you, I saw it...
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: What you saw could have been an
dialog: optical effect caused by gravitational
dialog: distortion.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (turning on Weir)
dialog: I know what I saw and it wasn't a
dialog: fucking "optical effect!"
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Hold on, what's this "gravitational
dialog: distortion?"
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: It's possible that a burst of gravity
dialog: waves escaped from the Core,
dialog: distorting space-time. They could be
dialog: what hit the Lewis and Clark.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What could cause them?
dialog: (Weir doesn't answer)
dialog: What's in the Core?
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: It's complicated...
speaker_heading: MILLER

speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: That's how the gravity drive works,
dialog: you see: it focuses the black hole's

speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: I can't believe we built this.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It's insane.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: "Insane?" The finest astronauts fought

speaker_heading: MILLER

speaker_heading: STARCK

speaker_heading: JUSTIN

scene_heading: EXT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3
text: Miller squats on the girder, ready to push off. He focuses

text: The outer doors OPEN...
text: The rush of escaping atmosphere carries Justin's body out...
text: Miller pushes off... catches Justin's body... sending them
text: both back towards the open Airlock...
text: Ice forms on Justin's body. His veins bulge. Blood fountains
text: from his noise and mouth, forming a red icicle over his face.
text: Miller pulls him into the Airlock. Five seconds have passed
text: since the airlock door opened.
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3
text: Miller closes the Airlock behind them. Air HISSES into the

text: Miller opens the Inner Door. Peters and DJ rush in.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: Oh God... Justin...
text: DJ puts a tube in the Justin's mouth immediately, feeding

speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: I've got a pulse, he's alive...
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Pressure?
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: 90 over 50 and falling... .
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: He's crashing...
text: Blood bubbles from Justin's mouth and eyes. He GASPS, then
text: SCREAMS, spraying blood from his mouth.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: He can breathe. That's good. Let's
dialog: get him to Medical, go, go!

speaker_heading: PETERS

speaker_heading: MILLER

speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: Justin said something about, "The

speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: It means nothing.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Is that your "expert opinion?" The
dialog: only answer we've had out of you is

speaker_heading: WEIR

text: The man is clearly insane.
speaker_heading: DJ

speaker_heading: WEIR

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I said that?
speaker_heading: DJ

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I want to know what caused that noise.

speaker_heading: WEIR
text: Thermal changes in the hull could
dialog: have caused the metal to expand and
text: contract very suddenly, causing

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: That's bullshit and you know it! You
dialog: built this fucking ship and all I've
dialog: heard from you is bullshit!
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: What do you want me to say?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You said this ship creates a

speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: To what? Where did this ship go?
dialog: Where did you send it?
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Where has it been for the past seven
dialog: years?
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: The "Other Place," what is that...?
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I DON'T KNOW!

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: No. No change.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've analyzed Justin's blood samples.
dialog: There's no evidence of excessive
dialog: levels of carbon dioxide. Or anything
text: else out of ordinary.
text: A grim LAUGH from Miller.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Of course not. Justin just climbed
text: into the airlock because he felt
dialog: like it. Just one of those things.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I swore I'd never lose another man.
dialog: I came close today. Real close.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: "Another man?" Who?
text: Miller nods, pulls his service medal from beneath his
dialog: jumpsuit.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It was on the Goliath. There was
dialog: this bosun, Corrick, a young guy, a
dialog: lot like Justin. Edmund Corrick,
dialog: from Decatur, Georgia. He got caught
dialog: when the pressure doors sealed, one
text: closed on his arm. Severed it at the
dialog: wrist. The pain of that must have
dialog: been... He passed out and...
text: Miller trails off. DJ waits patiently. Finally:
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I, I tried to go back for him, to
dialog: save him, but I couldn't get to him
dialog: in time. The fire... Have you ever
dialog: seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like
text: a liquid, it slides over everything.
text: It was like a wave breaking over
text: him, a wave of fire. And then he was
dialog: gone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I never told anyone until now. But
dialog: this ship knew, DJ. It knows about
dialog: the Goliath, it knows about Corrick.
dialog: It knows our secrets. It knows what
dialog: we're afraid of.
dialog: (beat, wan smile)
dialog: And now you're going to tell me it's
dialog: carbon dioxide.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: No.
text: Miller sees something in DJ's expression.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: I've been listening to the
dialog: transmission. And I think Houston
dialog: made a mistake in the translation.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Go on.
text: DJ plays the recording again. Stops it abruptly.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: They thought it said, "Liberatis
dialog: me," "Save me," but it's not "me."
dialog: It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It's not a distress call. It's a
dialog: warning.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: It gets worse.
text: Miller stares at him.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: It's very hard to make out, but listen
dialog: to this final part.
text: He plays the recording again.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Do you hear it? Right there.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Hear what?
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex,"
dialog: from; "infera," the ablative case of
dialog: "inferi." "Hell."
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: "Save yourself. From Hell."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What are you saying, are you saying
dialog: that this ship is possessed?
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: No. I don't believe in that sort of
dialog: thing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship
dialog: has passed beyond the boundaries of
dialog: our universe, of reality. Who knows
dialog: where this ship has been... What

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

text: Peters body lying twisted and broken before the Core.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Oh no. Peters...?
text: He rushes to Peters. Reaches out to touch her but pulls his

speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Why did you do that? You didn't have

speaker_heading: CLAIRE (O.S.)
dialog: Billy.

scene_heading: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT
text: Claire stands naked before the bathroom mirror. Behind her,

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT - (SEX AND SUICIDE
speaker_heading: INTERCUT)
text: Weir stares at Claire in shock. She walks to him. Slowly.
text: She stops in front of him. Her arms hang at her sides. He
text: must reach for her.
text: He does, putting his hands on her hips. He slides from his
text: chair to the floor to his knees. He presses his face to her

scene_heading: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT
text: ...and in the bathroom, she clutches Weir's straight-razor...
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
text: She reaches down. Slowly, her arms cradle his head. She slides

scene_heading: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT
text: ...Claire slips into the steaming water...
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

scene_heading: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

scene_heading: INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT
text: A MUFFLED SCREAM rips through the Second Containment Seal.

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

speaker_heading: MILLER

speaker_heading: SMITH (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MILLER

text: Miller races down the corridor towards the airlock, towards

scene_heading: INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS
text: A BEEPING sound catches Smith's attention. He follows the

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I gotcha... I gotcha...
text: The BEEPS are coming closer and closer together.
text: Smith grabs a duffel.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I gotcha.

scene_heading: WHITE LIGHT. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION...
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED
speaker_heading: UMBILICUS)
text: Miller enters the docking bay even as a HUGE BLAST knocks
dialog: him back.
speaker_heading: MILLER
speaker_heading: NOOO!
text: Safety doors close, sealing off the airlock and preventing
dialog: loss of pressure.
scene_heading: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL
text: The SILENT EXPLOSION tears the Lewis and Clark into two
text: pieces, spiralling away from each other and from the Event
text: Horizon. Metal shards, like confetti, fill the space between
dialog: them.
scene_heading: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION
text: Cooper clings to the forward section, watching the Event
text: Horizon recede as he tumbles into space. His FRENZIED
text: BREATHING is the only sound.
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED
speaker_heading: UMBILICUS)
text: Miller gets to his feet. Stares out the window upon the

text: with his forearm.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper
dialog: are dead.
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
speaker_heading: DJ

speaker_heading: MILLER (O.S.)

dialog: Weir. He used one of the explosives
dialog: from the Corridor.
text: The door opens behind DJ. The lights go out. DJ turns...
text: Face to face with Weir...
text: Blood crusts Weir's cheekbones, his mouth. He has no eyes.
text: Only clotted, empty sockets.
text: DJ opens his mouth to SCREAM. Weir grabs DJ by the throat,
text: cutting him off.
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED
speaker_heading: UMBILICUS)
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: DJ, you read me?

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE
text: Too dark to see... glimpses of violent motion in the stainless
text: steel cabinets... the sounds of STRUGGLE continue...
text: ...then something WET... and the struggle stops.
speaker_heading: MILLER (O.S.)
dialog: (intercom)
dialog: DJ? DJ, come in...
text: Finally, Weir emerges from the gloom. He searches among the

dialog: needle... and thread...
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED
speaker_heading: UMBILICUS)
text: Miller, at the intercom. He tries another channel.
speaker_heading: MILLER

speaker_heading: WEIR (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Son of a bitch!
text: Miller yanks open a storage locker full of zero-G tool. Lifts

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION
text: Cooper watches the Event Horizon fall farther and farther
dialog: away.
text: He checks his oxygen gauge. One tank full, one tank at half.
text: Cooper twists his backpack around, giving him access to the
text: oxygen tanks. He seals off his primary hose and disconnects
text: the full tank. His gauge immediately goes to "Yellow -
dialog: Reserve."
text: Cooper points the full tank away from the Event Horizon and
dialog: OPENS IT...
text: The blast of pressurized air pushes him towards the ship,
text: leaving the wreckage of the Lewis and Clark behind.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR
text: Miller races through the corridors to Medical...
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

speaker_heading: MILLER

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE
text: Miller approaches the door to the Bridge. It is open...
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
text: Miller stands in the doorway. A figure sits at the helm.
text: Miller aims the nailgun.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Weir.
text: The figure doesn't move. Miller slowly circles around the
dialog: helm...
text: It's Starck. Bound with wire in a sadomasochistic pose,
text: unconscious.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Hold on... Get you outta these...
text: Miller kneels in front of her, puts down the nailgun, loosens
text: the cords. She BREATHES in ragged gasps, opens his eyes...
text: Then stops. She stares over Miller's shoulder like a deer
text: caught in the headlights.
text: Miller looks behind him...
text: WEIR STANDS THERE, STARING WITH EYES SEWN SHUT.
text: Miller reaches for the gun...
text: Weir hits him, sending Miller across the bridge into a
text: bulkhead. Weir picks up the nailgun, examines it.
text: Miller slowly gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Your eyes...
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I don't need them anymore. Where
dialog: we're going, we won't need eyes to
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Do you know what a singularity is,
dialog: Miller? Does your mind truly fathom
dialog: what a black hole is?
dialog: (beat)
text: It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal
dialog: NOTHING. And if God is Everything,
dialog: then I have seen the Devil.
dialog: (a dead man's grin)
dialog: It's a liberating experience.
text: With his free hand, Weir reaches for the navigation console.
text: Flips a series of switches with gore caked fingers.
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE (ENLARGED CONSOLE)
text: The display lights up.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Gravity drive primed. Do you wish to

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Weir grins as he flips the final switch.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
text: Gravity drive engaged. Activation in
dialog: T-minus ten minutes.
text: Miller lunges for the nailgun. Weir raises the nailgun to
text: point at Miller's face. Miller slowly backs away.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: If you miss me, you'll blow out the
dialog: hull. You'll die too.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: What makes you think I'll miss?
text: Miller sees something out of the corner of his eye...
scene_heading: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
text: Cooper. Outside, braced in the viewport bracket.
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
text: Weir spins and FIRES at Cooper. The nail lodges in the thick
text: quartz glass. A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet,
text: the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure.
text: Weir takes a step towards the window, raises the gun to fire
dialog: again.
scene_heading: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
text: Miller dives for the door. Before Weir can fire,
scene_heading: EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE WINDOW (HANGING SECTION)
text: the window EXPLODES outward.
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE
text: The ship HOWLS as air rushes out, ripping Weir off his feet.
text: Weir catches himself in the broken window, trying to pull
dialog: himself back in...
text: A monitor tears free, SMASHES into him. HE IS SUCKED OUT.
text: Miller pulls himself through the door as it begins to shut.
dialog: He is safe...
speaker_heading: STARCK (O.S.)
dialog: Don't leave me!
text: Miller turns. Starck clings to a console, barely able to
text: resist the winds that try to suck her into the void.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: (gasping for air)
dialog: Please... help, help me...
text: Miller hesitates, looking from Starck back into the safety
text: of the ship. The door continues to shut. In seconds, he will
dialog: be safe. And she will be dead.
text: Miller YELLS and rips a compressor from its mount, wedges it
text: in the door to keep it open. He keeps one hand on the door,
text: reaches the other hand to Starck.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Give me your hand! Your hand!
text: She does. Frost forms on their bodies as the air cools. Their
text: veins begin to bulge, blood pulses from their noses. He YELLS
dialog: with exertion...
text: ...drags her to the door... through the door...
text: ...as the compressor tears free, sucked into space...
text: ...and the door SNAPS shut, missing them by a fraction.
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE
text: Starck and Miller collapse against the door. A moment passes
dialog: between them. Just happy to be breathing...
text: ...and then the AIRLOCK KLAXON goes off.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: The forward airlock.
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR
text: Starck and Miller race towards the Forward Airlock Bay.
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - FORWARD AIRLOCK BAY NO. 4
text: They enter, see a humanoid shape moving in the strobing light
text: of the airlock.
speaker_heading: STARCK
text: Weir can't be alive.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Whatever was on that bridge wasn't
dialog: Weir.
text: Miller looks around for a weapon. Pulls a zero-G bolt cutter
text: from the wall. Wields it like a bat.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Stay behind me.
text: The inner airlock door releases with a HISS. Swings open...
text: Cooper tumbles through, clawing at his helmet.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: Cooper!
text: Starck rushes to him, takes his helmet off.
text: He SUCKS air in, COUGHS it out.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Let me breathe, let me breathe...
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: You're okay now, it's over...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (sees something)
text: It's not over. It's just starting.
text: Starck follows Miller's gaze to a workstations's flashing
scene_heading: display: GRAVITY DRIVE ENGAGED. ACTIVATION 00:06:43:01...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Weir activated the drive. He's sending
dialog: us to the Other Place.
speaker_heading: STARCK

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: How? The Bridge is gone.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: There must be a way! What about
dialog: Engineering?
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Can you shut it down?
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: I don't know the process, Dr. Weir
dialog: was the expert...
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I don't want to go where the last
dialog: crew went. I'd rather be dead.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: Blow it up?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: We blow the Corridor. Use the
text: foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it
dialog: from the rest of the ship. We stay
dialog: put...
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: ...and the gravity drive goes where
dialog: no man has gone before.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You prep the gravity couches. I'm
dialog: going to manually arm those

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Will it work?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
text: Cooper nods, heads for the gravity couch bay. Starck follows
text: Miller to the steel pressure door.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: I'll do it --
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: No. I'll be right back.
text: Miller opens the door.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Close it behind me. Just in case.
text: Beat. Starck stares at Miller as if memorizing his face.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: Don't be long.
text: Miller smiles wanly. The door slides shut with a dull THUNK.
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
text: Miller runs down the corridor. Stops at a bulkhead coupling.
text: Kneels down to remove the cover from an explosive charge,
text: switch it to MANUAL detonation.
text: Miller runs to the next coupling. Repeats the process...
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY
text: Starck and Cooper check the gravity couches. One by one,
text: they slide open...
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I'm gonna activate the emergency
dialog: beacon.
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: Hurry.
text: Cooper exits down a ladder. Starck turns to the console,
text: activates three gravity couches. Behind her, two begin to
dialog: fill with blue gel...
text: ...and one begins to fill with blood... the hint of dark
text: shapes moving within...
text: Starck doesn't see it, concentrates on the console.
text: THUMP. THUMP. Starck turns. Sees the bloody tank. Sees
text: something moving inside it.
text: She slowly crosses to the tank. Peers at it...
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY (TANK)
text: THUMP. A FACE PRESSES AGAINST THE GLASS, STARING BACK AT
text: HER. WEIR. Bone and muscle are exposed where the skin hasn't

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR BELOW GRAVITY COUCH BAY
text: A corridor beneath the Gravity Couch Bay. Cooper searches
text: through circuit panels until he finds the EMERGENCY BEACON

text: begins to STROBE...
text: DRIP. DRIP. A bloodstain spreads over his shoulder. He follows
text: the drip to the ceiling...
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Starck?
text: No response. He slowly moves to peer up the ladder...
text: ...as Starck CRASHES down, bloody but alive.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What...?
speaker_heading: STARCK
dialog: Run!
text: She shoves him away...

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

text: Miller throws a wicked right. Weir catches Miller's fist.
text: SQUEEZES until blood wells up between his fingers. Then slings
text: Miller against a cooling tank with BONE CRACKING force. Miller
text: collapses into the slime, barely able to raise his head to
dialog: breathe.
text: Weir slowly approaches.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What are you?
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: You know.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You want me to believe you're the
dialog: Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I'm not the Devil.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Then what, what are you? Tell me...
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: Better if I just show you.
text: Weir's hands reach down and he grabs Miller by the skull.

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
text: MILLER writhes in Weir's grip. His hands flail out to the
text: sides. One hand brushes a long steel cannister sunk in the
dialog: muck. A CO2 scrubber...
scene_heading: THE VISIONS CONTINUE:
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE (VISIONS FROM HELL)
text: DJ's dissected body, except that here, DJ looks up, and

scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - MODEL (VISIONS FROM HELL)

scene_heading: EXT. ALIEN TERRAIN - MODEL (VISIONS FROM HELL)

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: NO!
text: His hand closes on the scrubber and he swings it across Weir's
text: head. Weir reels back, stunned.
text: Miller gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You can't have them!
text: He hits Weir again. HARD. Blood gushes from Weir's skull,
text: filling the runes on his face.
text: Weir staggers. Miller attacks. Again and again and again...
text: This time Weir is ready. He catches the scrubber and tears
text: it from Miller's grasp. SMASHES Miller to the floor with a
text: single blow. Miller GROANS.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I'm not the Devil. I'm much, much
dialog: older. I watched the Beginning and I
dialog: will see the End. I am the dark behind
dialog: the stars. I am the dark inside you
dialog: all.
text: Miller gets to all fours, trying to get up.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: ...not the Devil...
text: Weir kicks Miller savagely. Miller slides through the coolant,
text: comes to rest beneath a walkway. He attempts to rise,
text: collapses back into the sludge.
text: Weir slowly stalks towards him.
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: There is no Devil. There is no God.
text: There is only... NOTHING.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You're lying...!
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: I'm not asking you to believe me.
dialog: You'll see for yourself... and so
dialog: will your crew. You're all coming
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Starck... Cooper...
text: Weir's grotesque face is inches from his. He reaches down
text: and pulls Miller from the dripping ooze...
speaker_heading: WEIR
dialog: They are mine. And so are you...
text: ...as Miller clears the surface, he holds something in his
dialog: fist.
text: Miller stares dead-on into Weir's hellish face...
text: ...and raises his right hand. HE'S HOLDING THE DETONATOR.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (a grim smile of
dialog: triumph)
dialog: You can't have them. Go to hell.
speaker_heading: WEIR
speaker_heading: NOOO!

dialog: ship...
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
text: ...followed frames later by a sequence of DETONATIONS that
text: rip the Main Access Corridor apart and propel the foredecks

scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR (ROLLOVER SET)

scene_heading: EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL
text: Waves of distortion ripple over the Event Horizon's
dialog: containment section...
text: A dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as
text: the gateway opens... A BLACK HOLE...
text: The black hole begins to shrink, imploding. As it collapses,
text: it sucks Neptune's blue clouds with it, creating a TITANIC
text: WHIRLPOOL with the black hole at its center...
text: The SHRIEKING winds carry the foredecks back towards the
text: whirlpool, towards the black hole...
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR (ROLLOVER SET)
text: Cooper and Starck slide across the floor as the deck tips at
dialog: a terrific angle...
scene_heading: EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL
text: The foredecks teeter on the edge of oblivion...
text: The black hole collapses utterly, vanishing to a point. An

text: The foredecks ride the wave away from the implosion and out
dialog: of Neptune's atmosphere to safety...
scene_heading: INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR WINDOW
text: The VIBRATIONS subside. Cooper and Starck stagger to their
