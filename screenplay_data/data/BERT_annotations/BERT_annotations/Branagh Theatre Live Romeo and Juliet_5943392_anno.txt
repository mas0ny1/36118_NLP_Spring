dialog: Steven Wolfson & Jed Wallace
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: Two large wooden doors open into a BEAUTIFUL LIBRARY. Bound
text: leather books sit in mahogany bookshelves. Vaulted ceilings
dialog: and ornate furniture suggest this place was made very long
dialog: ago.
text: The CAMERA slowly approaches a table where a FINELY CRAFTED
text: BOOK lies open. The page reads “Chapter One,” and a colorful
text: illustration shows an Italian town in the hills.
text: Suddenly we HEAR a little voice call us ...
speaker_heading: THE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Psst! Up here!
text: We look up and see an adorable little bat, hanging upside
text: down in the corner of the library. This is FLYER.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: It’s me, Flyer.
text: Unable to contain his excitement, Flyer swoops down and lands
text: beside the book. He gestures toward the open page.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: Here to read the most romantic love story
dialog: the world has ever known?
dialog: (Hopefully)
dialog: Mind if I read with you? I love a love
dialog: story.
text: The CAMERA moves in closer to the page’s illustration. Ina
text: second or two we are INSIDE THE PICTURE.
scene_heading: EXT. A STARRY NIGHT IN VERONA
text: We approach A DELIGHTFUL LITTLE TOWN tucked into a small
text: valley between picturesque mountains. A full moon hangs in
text: the cloudless sky.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.0.)
dialog: Besides ... this story took place in my
dialog: hometown. Verona.
text: As we swoop down closer, the town’s towers and spires rise to
text: meet us. We circle around THE CATHEDRAL and come in for a
text: closer look. The bell in the tower is ringing. Hanging
text: upside down in the window of the BELFRY is a younger version
dialog: of Flyer.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.O) (cont'd)
dialog: I used to hang out in the Belfry.
text: He drops out of the window and flies with us down a
text: COBBLESTONE LANE lined with homes as pretty as gingerbread
text: houses. Lights flicker in nearly every window.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: I was just a young whipper-snapper at the
dialog: time ...
text: As we approach THE PIAZZA where townsfolk happily call out
text: farewells to one another, Flyer bumps into a sign hanging in
text: front of The Butcher’s Store and knocks himself silly.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: +-. working out the kinks in my radar ...
text: A moment later Flyer has gotten himself going again and
text: approaches A BEAUTIFUL VILLA.
text: A GROUP OF BIRDS are sitting on the banister of the balcony
text: watching something below. Flyer lands between a couple of
text: PRETTY WHITE DOVES and tries to put his wings around them.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: «+. this was back in my unpopular days
text: The Doves look at one another clearly frightened of Flyer.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: .--- back when everyone thought we bats
dialog: were scary!
text: IN A FLASH the Doves dart to the other side of the balcony
text: where they clearly feel a lot more comfortable. All the
text: other birds turn their backs on Flyer and look down into the
text: street. Flyer has to flap up onto the roof of the balcony to
dialog: get a view of ...
text: A young man looking up to the balcony longingly, where a
text: young woman looks sadly toward the moon. These young lovers
text: are of course ROMEO and JULIET.
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: But soft! What light through yonder
dialog: window breaks? It is the east, and
dialog: Juliet is the sun!
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.0.)
dialog: Wait a second ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou
dialog: Romeo?
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.0.)
dialog: Hey!
dialog: "(Whistling loudly)
dialog: Wait a second, I said!
text: A GIGANTIC IMAGE OF THE OLDER FLYER steps into our view of
text: the lovers and blocks it almost completely.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: Wrong-o! Cease it! Cut!
text: The CAMERA moves back to reveal FLYER standing in front of
text: the open book in the library. The picture on the page is now
dialog: of Romeo and Juliet.
text: Flyer takes a step or two away from the book much like a
text: trial lawyer about to spring a surprise on a witness.
text: Suddenly he turns back to the page and points to the picture
text: accusingly ...
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: That is not the most romantic love story
dialog: the world’s ever known!
dialog: (Mockingly)
dialog: Oh no no no no no. Far from it!
text: The picture on the page of the book becomes animated again.
text: Flyer looks at the young lovers almost disdainfully.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: I mean, yes, if you’re going to be
dialog: technical about it. The story you’re
dialog: talking about is nice. It has its
dialog: moments ...
text: On the balcony Juliet looks deeply into Romeo’s eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What’s in a name! That which we call a
dialog: rose by any other name would smell as
dialog: sweet.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: ‘Course, some of the dialogue’s a little
dialog: much, if you ask me. Now, if you want to
dialog: see the most romantic story ... you got
dialog: to look ...
text: (Pointing to the corner of the
dialog: picture)
dialog: -.. down here ...
text: The CAMERA now begins to RE-ENTER the illustration where
text: Flyer has gestured to.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.O.) (cont'd)
text: .+. where only I could see it, sitting
text: up there on the roof.
text: The CAMERA moves slowly down off the balcony, down the side
text: of the building, past the swooning Romeo, across the street,
text: and down an embankment.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: This story comes from an entirely
dialog: different part of Verona ...
dialog: 
text: Our view continues moving down to beside the river, where a_
text: handsome golden retriever puppy watches Romeo’s every gesture
text: with admiration. This is ROVER.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: And involves different characters
dialog: altogether.
text: Two other puppies hang out nearby. BENNY, a goofy looking
text: basset hound, chases his tail in circles, kicking up mud
text: everywhere. MERCURY, a brown and black bulldog, exercises
text: rigorously, further sculpting his already fine-tuned four-
text: legged physique.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.O) (cont'd)
dialog: Though these characters from time to time
dialog: may seem a little familiar ...
text: Rover sighs loudly, completely oblivious to his friends’ more
dialog: canine concerns.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Oh, I wish I was in love.
text: Benny momentarily stops his twirling and looks at Rover.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Love? What do you want to be in love
dialog: for, Rover? All that sniffing each other
dialog: and stuff. Yeech!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: But Benny, then you have somebody, and
dialog: they have you.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: You have more than that.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Rover, just think about it, would you?
dialog: Oh sure, it’s all fun in the beginning.
text: Candlelight dinners at the cozy trash can
text: behind the butchers’. Making puppy-dog
text: eyes at one another. But then things
dialog: change. One thing leads to another.
dialog: Pretty soon you got a litter full of
dialog: problems to worry about.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I suppose ... but still, I want to be in
dialog: love ...
text: Benny has resumed his tail-chasing routine. Mercury turns to
text: him clearly annoyed.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Benny, dog gone it! Don’t you know
dialog: you’re never gonna catch your tail?
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: (Continuing to chase his tail)
dialog: Yes, I am! Yes I am! I almost ... got
dialog: it ...
text: And he promptly chases his tail ... right into the river! A
text: second later he comes up for air, panicking ...
speaker_heading: BENNY (cont'd)
dialog: I can’t swim! I can’t swim! Mercury,
dialog: help me!
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Just don’t panic!
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: What do I do?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Paddle!
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
text: Dog paddle.
text: Benny seems to get the hang of it.
speaker_heading: MERCURY (cont'd)
dialog: That's it.
text: A moment later Benny pulls himself ashore, completely
text: drenched.
speaker_heading: MERCURY (cont'd)
dialog: What did I tell you? But would you
dialog: listen? No!
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: But I almost had it that time, I swear.
text: Just as Benny shakes himself off we hear a DEEP AUTHORITATIVE
dialog: VOICE ...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: And just what are you pups up to?
text: The three young dogs turn and discover a pack of street-wise
text: dogs who peer down at them sternly. One of the older dogs is
text: clearly the leader. This is Rover's father, BIG DADDY
speaker_heading: MONGREL.
text: Big Daddy is dripping wet and clearly unamused. The younger
text: dogs leap to attention guiltily.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: (Stammering)
dialog: N - nothing, Big Daddy. W - we’re j -
dialog: just -
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: Doggin’ it! You boys are supposed to be
text: off collecting scraps.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: I tried to tell them, sir, but they
dialog: wouldn't listen.
text: Big Daddy Mongrel gives Rover a disapproving look. Rover
text: lowers his eyes ashamed.
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: Come here, son.
text: Big Daddy Mongrel puts a paw on Rover’s shoulder and looks
text: into his eyes.
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL (cont’d)
dialog: You’re almost a year old now. Don’t you
dialog: think it’s about time you start acting
dialog: like it?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I know, I know ...
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: Your mother and I got hopes for you. You
dialog: think I got to be the top dog rolling
dialog: around in the daisies? No. You got to
dialog: work for it.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: He says he wants to be in love, Big
dialog: Daddy.
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: What? Is that true, Rover?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Well ... yes.
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: You spend too much time playing fetch
dialog: with Romeo.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: There’s nothing wrong with Romeo. He’s
dialog: nice to me. He brings me biscuits and
dialog: scratches behind my ears -
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: Well! If Romeo is so nice ...
text: Big Daddy Mongrel stares at his son truly angry now.
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: ++. Can you tell me why he’s falling in
dialog: love ...
text: Big Daddy Mongrel points dramatically up to Juliet.
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: +.. with a CAT OWNER! !
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Juliet owns cats?
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: Where do you think the Cat-Pulet’s live,
dialog: boy?
text: Big Daddy Mongrel looks at Romeo disdainfully.
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL (cont’d)
dialog: That boy’s probably got cat hair all over
dialog: him by now.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (Disillusioned)
dialog: No!
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: So let me hear no more of Romeo or love.
dialog: They are dangerous influences.
text: Rover nods sadly. It is like he has lost a hero.
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL (cont’d)
dialog: Now get out there and get us some scraps!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Yes, Father.
text: The three young dogs leave their elders with their tails
text: between their legs. After a moment, Rover takes a last look
text: up to the balcony.
speaker_heading: ROVER (cont'd)
dialog: I didn’t know Juliet owns cats.
text: Our view now begins to focus on Juliet’s window.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Are you kidding? She’s got more cats
dialog: than I got fleas.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Can you believe that? Actually liking
dialog: cats?
scene_heading: INT. JULIET’S BEDROOM
text: Inside Juliet’s window we see that the young lover sits on a
text: chair crying for Romeo. In her sadness, she reaches for a
text: black and white, nearly full-grown kitten.
speaker_heading: MERCURY (0.S.)
dialog: They say she even pets them...
text: Juliet puts the kitten on her lap.
speaker_heading: MERCURY (0.S.) (cont’d)
dialog: Sometimes they even sit on her lap!
speaker_heading: ROVER (0.S.)
dialog: It's so ... so... tragic.
text: Juliet looks in the kitten’s eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh Juliet, true friend Juliet, what dost
dialog: thou think I should do?
text: LADY AND LORD CAT-PULET, two immaculately groomed long-haired
text: cats, sit on Juliet’s vanity table. They are the kitten’s
text: parents. When Lady Cat-Pulet hears the girl call the kitten
text: “Juliet,” she shakes her head.
scene_heading: LADY CAT-PULET
dialog: I still can’t believe that girl named her
dialog: pet after herself!
scene_heading: LORD CAT-PULET
dialog: You have to remember, the child’s only
dialog: fourteen.
scene_heading: LADY CAT-PULET
dialog: I’m fourteen, too! You see me doing
dialog: anything so foolish?
scene_heading: LORD CAT-PULET
dialog: No dear ...
text: The human Juliet (hereafter referred to as “Juliet the Girl”)
text: sets the kitten Juliet (hereafter referred to as “Juliet”) on
text: her lap. Then she takes a tissue and looks longingly out the
dialog: window.
scene_heading: JULIET THE GIRL
dialog: (Sniffling)
dialog: Dost thou think Romeo will be true?
text: Below Juliet the Girl’s chair sits DOC, a persian cat with
text: furtive eyes and a manner of speaking very akin to Mae West.
text: When she and the other cats talk near people, they do so
text: under their breaths, and it is very clear that humans are not
text: aware that the animals are talking.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Oh please ...
text: Juliet the Girl lets her tissue drop to the ground. Doc
text: picks it up and hands it to Lady and Lord Cat-Pulet on the
text: vanity table. Lord Cat-Pulet is taking the tissues from Doc
text: and writing on them with an eye-liner. Lady Cat-Pulet puts
text: paw-prints on them using ruby-red lipstick.
speaker_heading: DOC (cont'd)
dialog: --- doesn’t she know men are dogs?
text: TYGER, a ferocious striped cat with a menacing smile, sits on
text: Juliet the Girl’s bed. He practices hurling his claws into a
text: picture of a dog like humans throw darts at a dart board.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: You give men a bad name, Doc. Only dogs
dialog: are dogs.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Maybe baby, but every male of every
text: species has a bit of canine in him. Even
dialog: you, Tyger.
text: Tyger swats a ball of yarn at Doc, but she dodges it easily.
scene_heading: LADY CAT-PULET
dialog: Stop it you two. We have work to do.
scene_heading: LADY CAT-PULET (cont'd)
dialog: Juliet, come on. These invitations for
dialog: the animal ball have to go out tomorrow.
text: Juliet whispers discreetly as Juliet the Girl continues to
dialog: cry.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Mother, what am I supposed to do?
scene_heading: LADY CAT-PULET
dialog: Act prissy. It’s every cat’s
dialog: prerogative.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I can’t do that. Juliet needs me.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (Mocking)
dialog: Needs you! Until she’s got a date.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: That's not true! Juliet’s different ...
text: Meanwhile, TYBALT, a dashing young human in his late teens
text: has come into Juliet the Girl’s room. He picks Tyger up off
text: the bed and throws him into the air! As Tyger screeches
text: horribly and struggles to land on his feet, Tybalt laughs
text: delightedly.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: JULIET THE GIRL
dialog: Tybalt!
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Oh come now dearest cousin, they’re only
dialog: cats.
text: Juliet the Girl sets Juliet down and crosses to Tyger.
scene_heading: JULIET THE GIRL
dialog: They’re more than that. They’re my
dialog: friends.
text: She pats Tyger on the head.
scene_heading: JULIET THE GIRL (cont’d)
dialog: You all right, little one?
text: Tyger purrs happily. Juliet turns proudly back to Doc,
text: gesturing to Juliet the Girl.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You see how Juliet is different?
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Well, thoust will never guess what I did
text: find downstairs after the ball.
scene_heading: JULIET THE GIRL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Evidence that Montagues were there.
scene_heading: JULIET THE GIRL
dialog: Montagues!
speaker_heading: TYBALT
dialog: Yes, come this way and I will show you.
text: Tybalt and Juliet the Girl leave. Tyger heads over to the
text: ball of yarn.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Come on, help me roll this up.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I can’t stand yarn.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: How can you be a cat and not like a ball
dialog: of yarn?
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I don’t know.
text: She leaps to the window sill and looks outside longingly.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I like the ball in the sky. What do you
dialog: call that?
scene_heading: LADY CAT-PULET
dialog: It’s the moon.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: The moon. Oh I think it is so beautiful.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Beautiful? What’s so beautiful about the
dialog: moon. Next you’ll be howling like a dog
text: at it.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: But I think it’s beautiful. I do.
text: She looks at the globed lamp posts.
speaker_heading: JULIET
text: And the balls of light outside. And the
text: balls that people throw to one another in
dialog: the park. Sometimes I see balls bouncing
dialog: down the street so fast. Not like balls
text: of yarn that roll a couple feet and stop.
text: But balls that go faster and faster.
dialog: Sometimes I want to chase those balls.
text: Right outside, into the big wide world.
text: Lady and Lord Cat-Pulet look at one another concerned. Lord
text: Cat-Pulet clears his throat and gives Doc a look that means
dialog: something like, “will you talk some sense into the girl?”
text: Doc sets down her work and goes up to Juliet on the window
dialog: sill.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Juliet, you’re not feeling ... curious
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yes, I am.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: How many times do I have to tell you that
dialog: curiosity kills -
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: But I don’t see why it has to. Don’t you
dialog: ever wonder, Doc, what it must be like to
dialog: live outside?
scene_heading: MEANWHILE OUTSIDE ...
dialog: 12.
text: Rover, Benny and Mercury are looking for scraps. Mercury
text: scans the contents of some trash cans they’ve just dumped
text: over much as a construction foreman oversees a project.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Nothin’ here, come on.
text: He immediately heads off toward the next alley. As soon as
text: he’s out of sight, Benny jumps on top of one of the trash
text: cans like a western log-roller. Rover takes one whiff of the
text: garbage and grimaces. A second later he glances up to a
text: window. It is not Juliet’s window.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Benny?
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: (Trying to balance himself)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Have you ever wondered what it must be
dialog: like to live ... inside?
text: The sound of the word “inside” literally sends Benny hurling.
text: He falls face first into a barrel. A moment later he
text: reappears covered in goop.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Inside?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: You think you’re some kind of poodle, or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: No, no, I just wonder. Don’t you ever
dialog: wonder?
dialog: INSIDE ...
text: Juliet looks out the window.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I imagine flowers and sunshine and
text: leaping in the trees. There’d be wide
dialog: open spaces and rivers and lakes and you
dialog: could go swimming!
text: Doc gives Juliet a look like she has gone completely off her
dialog: rocker.
text: OUTSIDE ...
text: Rover continues to peer into windows longingly.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: ROVER
text: I imagine a fireplace and music and
text: chewing a shoe. There’d be food served
dialog: in bowls and I'd wear bells ... anda
text: ribbon in my hair.
text: Benny puts a paw on Rover’s forehead to make sure he doesn’t
dialog: have a fever.
dialog: INSIDE ...
text: Juliet leads Doc into the kitchen, where we see pet dishes on
text: the floor. Tyger tails along behind, looking on
dialog: suspiciously.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Don’t you ever get tired of warm milk and
dialog: cold tuna and wearing these tight
dialog: collars?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: But they’re diamond studded. You know
dialog: how I love studs.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Call me crazy, but in my dreams I see
dialog: myself standing on a tall bridge, taking
dialog: off this horrid collar and throwing it
dialog: into the river!
text: OUTSIDE ...
text: Rover turns a corner and directs Benny’s attention to a group
text: of sad and lonely dogs struggling to survive in the street.
text: Mercury looks at his two friends with concern.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Don’t you ever get tired of dog catchers
dialog: and cold nights and digging in the trash?
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: I love trash!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Call me crazy, but in my dreams I see
dialog: myself settling down to sleep on a satin
text: pillow beside my master’s bed.
dialog: INSIDE ...
text: Juliet leaps to the kitchen window and looks out.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: That's what the outside would be, a place
dialog: where I could be me, a place where I
dialog: could be ...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: What?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Free.
text: OUTSIDE ...
text: Rover jumps a short hedge and peers in the front window of a
text: charming little home. Benny is right behind.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: That's the kind of place that I crave, a
dialog: place where you don’t even have to be
dialog: brave, a place where for once I would be
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Safe.
dialog: 
text: A dreamy smile spreads across Benny’s face as he gets caught
text: up in Rover's fantasy.
dialog: INSIDE ...
text: Doc has nearly the exact same look on her face, but Tyger
text: SCREECHES and brings an end to that.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: It’s not all fun and games out there, you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: It isn’t?
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: There’s lots of stuff you have to do that
dialog: isn’t fun.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Well ... like scratching yourself for
dialog: instance.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Scratching myself? But whatever for?
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Because you’1ll have fleas!
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Fleas! My goodness!
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: And what’s more ...
text: Tyger whispers something in Juliet’s ear that surprises her.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Really!
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: But I don’t even know what a fire hydrant
dialog: is!
text: OUTSIDE ...
text: Mercury SNARLS at Rover as well.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Don’t kid yourself, home sweet home ain’t
dialog: all it’s cracked up to be.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: It isn’t?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Well, because you have to keep yourself
dialog: clean.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Clean? What’s that mean?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: It means you have to lick yourself all
dialog: the time.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: And you even have to ...
text: Mercury whispers in Rover’s ear. Rover turns to him
text: startled.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: In a box?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: In_a_box!
dialog: INSIDE ...
text: Tyger and Doc lead Juliet back into the bedroom.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: So don’t get yourself all excited. It’s
dialog: a jungle out there, kiddo.
text: OUTSIDE ...
text: Mercury and Benny lead Rover back to the trash cans.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: So don’t go getting a bunch of ideas. It
dialog: can be war in there, buster.
dialog: INSIDE ...
text: As Doc and Tyger go back to work on the invitations, Juliet
text: looks out the window again.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Still, sometimes I can’t help wonder ...
text: OUTSIDE ...
text: Rover looks up to a window again as Mercury and Benny go back
text: to scrounging.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Still, sometimes I can’t help wonder ...
scene_heading: SPLIT SCREEN : INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
text: Both Rover and Juliet look forlornly toward the different
dialog: worlds they seek.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What it would be like ...
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: What it would be like ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: +.. to live outside.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: +.. to live inside.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PIAZZA - MORNING
text: The colorful town square is teeming with SHOPPERS. Italian
text: VENDORS peddle everything from fresh produce to fine
text: clothing. The camera pans down through the crowd until we
text: are almost ground-level in front of a WATCHMAKER’S KIOSK.
text: Passing by are the legs and feet of busy shoppers.
text: SUDDENLY, Rover’s head pops out from under the red curtain
text: that encircles the kiosk. He anxiously looks around, making
dialog: sure not to be seen.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: (From behind the curtain)
dialog: How’s it look, Rover?
text: Rover looks directly across from the watchmaker’s kiosk at
scene_heading: THE MEAT STAND.
text: A FAT BUTCHER is in the process of cutting steaks and chops
text: for his customers. Rover licks his lips ...
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Like dinner! And then some!
text: With that, a GIANT PAW pulls Rover behind the curtain.
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE KIOSK
text: Hiding behind the curtain are Benny and Mercury. Big Daddy
text: Mongrel holds Rover by a tuft of hair.
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY
dialog: This is a delicate operation,
dialog: boys. One wrong move could
dialog: land you in the pound.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (Cocky)
dialog: Not to worry, Pops ...
text: Big Daddy looks at him sternly.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (Gulping)
dialog: --. I mean, Big Daddy.

speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: (Still trying to catch his own
dialog: tail)
dialog: How do I do that, Big Daddy?
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY
dialog: Trust me. Just be yourself.
dialog: Mercury, you back up Rover
text: while he’s nabbing the goods.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: You can count on me, Big Daddy.
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY
dialog: Good luck, boys. Make this old Mongrel
dialog: proud.
text: The three dogs head out. Big Daddy is clearly worried about

text: his pups.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA
text: Rover and Mercury make their way towards the meat stand.
text: Benny lags behind.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Something wild ... something wild ...
text: Benny notices a JUGGLER performing for a group of children.
text: The juggler has several red balls in the air. Behind him is
text: a vegetable stand.
text: Benny spots a_pile of ripe tomatoes and suddenly has an idea.
scene_heading: EXT. MEAT STAND
text: While The Butcher is busy helping his customers, Rover and
text: Mercury sneak up from behind. Benny positions himself in the
dialog: crowd.
text: Rover waits, then gives Benny the signal. With that, Benny
text: begins to BARK as loud as he can. The crowd of people turn
dialog: to look.
text: Amazingly, Benny climbs up on his hind legs and JUGGLES TWO
text: TOMATOES WITH HIS FRONT PAWS. People ooh and aah. Even
text: The Butcher watches in amazement. Meanwhile, Rover jumps up
text: onto the meat counter and begins pushing steaks and chops
dialog: down to Mercury.
text: Benny continues to juggle for the adoring crowd. In no time
dialog: at all he is up to twelve tomatoes! But when Benny goes for
text: number thirteen, they all come tumbling down on his head.
text: Benny is left covered in tomato juice.
text: The crowd sighs and returns to shopping. It is then that The
text: Butcher finally notices what Rover is doing.
speaker_heading: BUTCHER
dialog: Hey, you stinky mongrel! Those are my
dialog: steaks!
text: The Butcher picks up his MEAT CLEVER, but just before he can
dialog: slice Rover in two ...
speaker_heading: BUTCHER (cont'd)
dialog: Aaaaaaah!!!!
text: Mercury BITES him on the leg, giving Rover the chance to
dialog: escape.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA
text: Rover runs through the crowd. When he turns for a split
text: second to see if he’s being chased, the terrified pup ...
dialog: 19.
text: SLAMS RIGHT INTO A PAIR OF LEGS. A bit dazed, Rover looks up
dialog: and finds ...
text: .-. ROMEO staring right down at him.
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Alas, ‘tis my favorite stray.
text: Romeo scoops up Rover, who still has a steak hanging in his
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: ROMEO (cont'd)
dialog: Thou art a criminal in need of
dialog: a place to hide. Come. We shall find
dialog: you a fine wine to
dialog: go with your meal.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER SECTION OF THE PIAZZA
text: Mercury and Benny, still covered in tomatoes, make their way
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: You had to be a hot shot, didn’t you.
text: Like a dog juggling twelve tomatoes
dialog: wasn’t enough of a distraction. You just
dialog: had to go for thirteen!
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: I like to challenge myself.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Believe me, Big Daddy is going to do more
dialog: than that when he finds out we blew the
dialog: caper.
scene_heading: EXT. WINE KIOSK
text: Romeo, still holding Rover, looks through the many wines.
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Wine seller, bring me your most
dialog: prized vintage. Tonight is a special
dialog: occasion.
text: The Wine Seller bows and goes in back. Romeo leans down and
text: whispers to Rover, unaware that the dog can understand every
dialog: word he says.
speaker_heading: ROMEO (cont'd)
dialog: Can you keep a secret, my friend? I, a
dialog: Montague, am to marry Juliet, a Capulet,
text: in secret tonight at the old church.
text: As if on cue, AN EXPENSIVE HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE appears in
text: the piazza. Lord and Lady Capulet step out, followed by
dialog: their evil nephew, Tybalt.
text: Tybalt spots Romeo and throws him a nasty look.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: ROMEO (cont'd)
dialog: Perhaps our marriage can finally bring
dialog: this feud between our families to an end.
scene_heading: EXT. CAPULET’S CARRIAGE
text: When The Capulets are well out of sight, the carriage’s back
text: compartment pops open and out jumps Tyger. He makes sure
text: that the coast is clear, then calls for his henchcats.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Shake! Speare!
text: SHAKE and SPEARE, two Siamese cats who bear an amazing
text: resemblance to The Bard, slowly climb out of the carriage.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: To be ...
speaker_heading: SPEARE
dialog: Or not to be ...
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Where are the party invitations?
text: Shake and Speare look at one another and shrug.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Now that is the question.
text: Frustrated, Tyger WHOOPS them both on the head. He then
text: jumps back into the carriage, locates the invitations and
text: throws them down.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Make sure every animal gets one.
text: The henchcats scoop up the invitations and head off into the
dialog: piazza.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Friends...!
speaker_heading: SPEARE
dialog: Romans...!
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Country mice...!
speaker_heading: SPEARE
dialog: Lend me your ears!
text: Tyger shakes his head in embarrassment.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: I gotta get me some new henchcats ...
text: Just then, Tyger spots Rover in Romeo’s arms. The two make
text: eye contact. Tyger hisses and throws the nervous puppy a
dialog: 21.
text: look as nasty as Tybalt’s. He comes after Rover, ready to
dialog: attack.
scene_heading: EXT. WINE SELLER’S KIOSK
text: As Tyger approaches, Rover jumps out of Romeo’s arms and
text: makes a run for it.
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Hey! Where’s thou going?
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY
text: Rover runs through the piazza and winds up in a dark and
text: scary alley. He comes to a dead end, and when he tries to
text: turn around, Tyger suddenly JUMPS down right in front of him.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Don’t you know stray dogs
dialog: aren’t allowed in the piazza?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Well, um...
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: All I'd have to do is get the dog
text: catcher’s attention.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (Trying to be brave)
dialog: Why don’t you leave me alone.
dialog: I wasn’t bothering you.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: You're a dog. Your mere existence
dialog: bothers me.
text: Tyger moves closer, menacingly.
speaker_heading: TYGER (cont'd)
dialog: It's been a long time since I clawed
dialog: anyone. Almost a week.
text: Tyger raises his razor sharp claws above Rover's head.
speaker_heading: MERCURY (0.S.)
dialog: Why don’t you pick on somebody your own
dialog: size.
text: Tyger turns to find Mercury and Benny.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Two against one. Not what you’d call a
dialog: fair fight.
text: Mercury pushes Benny to the side with Rover.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: How’s that?
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: That’s not fair either.
dialog: For you, that is ...
text: Tyger LUNGES at Mercury. The two animals literally fight
text: like cats and dogs, rolling all the way back into the piazza.
text: People run and scream to get out of the way.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PRINCE’S ROYAL BOX
text: From his seat high above the piazza, THE PRINCE notices the
text: commotion. He signals for his PAGE.
speaker_heading: THE PRINCE
dialog: What’s going on down there?
speaker_heading: PAGE
text: It looks like a cat and dog fighting, my
dialog: liege.
speaker_heading: THE PRINCE
dialog: Just what I need. More fighting!
text: Noticing that The Prince is agitated, a SERVANT races to his
text: side and begins massaging his temples.
speaker_heading: THE PRINCE (cont’d)
text: As if The Capulets and The Montagues
dialog: weren’t enough of a headache. Send for
dialog: my royal dog catcher to break it up.
speaker_heading: PAGE
dialog: Yes, my liege.
dialog: (Shouting)
text: SEND FOR THE ROYAL DOG CATCHER!
text: The command is heard repeated by a series of pages until it
dialog: reaches ...
scene_heading: INT. THE DOG POUND
text: The cages are teeming with strays. THE ROYAL DOG CATCHER, a
text: tall and sinister-looking fellow dressed entirely in black,
text: polishes his silver dog catcher’s net.
speaker_heading: DOG CATCHER
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Party time.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA
text: Mercury and Tyger are still going at it, knocking over
text: everything in their path. With all of his strength, Mercury
text: pushes Tyger to the ground and raises his paw in the air.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Say nighty-night, Kitty.
dialog: 23.
text: A GALLOPING SOUND is suddenly heard. Rover turns and finds
text: the Dog Catcher racing toward him on his black horse.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Merc’, it’s the fuzz!
text: Mercury looks up and sees the dog catcher’s net about to
text: swoop down on Rover! He jumps off of Tyger and pushes his
text: friend out of the way just in the nick of time. The three
text: dogs make a run for it.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE PIAZZA
text: The puppies race to get out of the piazza. But The Dog
text: Catcher is right on their tails, whipping his horse to run
dialog: faster.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: He’s almost got us!
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: This way!
text: Mercury leads the dogs through a narrow passage between two
text: kiosks. But as Rover tries to escape, THE DOG CATCHER GRABS
dialog: HIM BY THE TAIL!
speaker_heading: DOG CATCHER
dialog: (ala The Wicked Witch)
dialog: I’ve got you my pretty...!
text: But The Dog Catcher’s wrong. Mercury and Benny, pulling
text: Rover from the other side, save their friend. Rover’s tail
text: slips right through The Dog Catcher’s hands.
speaker_heading: DOG CATCHER (cont'd)
speaker_heading: NOLLIL!
text: He watches as the three dogs vanish into the streets.
speaker_heading: DOG CATCHER (cont’d)
dialog: Next time your tail is mine.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE PIAZZA
text: The dogs stop to catch their breath.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: That was too close for comfort.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: You’re telling me! Thanks for saving my
dialog: tail, guys.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Anytime.
text: In the gutter, TWO RATS hold one of the Cat-Pulets’ party
dialog: invitations.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: FIRST RAT
dialog: What are you going as?
speaker_heading: SECOND RAT
dialog: I don’t know. I always wanted to be a
text: hamster.
speaker_heading: FIRST RAT
dialog: A hamster? That’s so obvious.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: What are you rats talking about?
speaker_heading: FIRST RAT
dialog: We just got invited to the social event
dialog: of the season. Any animal who’s anyone
dialog: will be there.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Hey, we’re animals.
dialog: (Thinking)
dialog: Aren’t we?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Lemme see that ...
text: Mercury grabs the invitation. It reads, ‘LORD AND LADY
scene_heading: CAT-PULET CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO THEIR COSTUME BALL.
scene_heading: PLEASE RSVP. P.S. NO DOGS ALLOWED!’
speaker_heading: MERCURY (cont'd)
dialog: Well if that don’t beat all. The furballs
dialog: are having a ball. And we ain’t invited.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: No big surprise, seeing how much they
dialog: hate us.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Maybe so. But if this shindig is good
dialog: enough for a bunch of rats ...
speaker_heading: RATS
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: --. well then it’s good enough for a
dialog: bunch of dogs. And I think I know just
dialog: how to get even with Tyger in the
dialog: process. You boys game?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Absolutely!
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Just as long as I don’t have

scene_heading: EXT. VERONA’S ZOO - MONTAGE
text: The monkeys swipe the sleeping zookeeper’s keys and let the
text: other exotic animals out of their cages.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - MONTAGE
text: A virtual menagerie makes its way through the city toward the
text: Cat-Pulet’s villa. Some of the animals are easy to recognize
text: under their costumes (the elephant dressed as a kangaroo, for
text: example), while others are completely disguised.
scene_heading: EXT. VILLA - MONTAGE
text: Lord and Lady Cat-Pulet greet their guests as they arrive at
text: the front gates. When the elephant shows up, they have him
dialog: go around back.
scene_heading: EXT. CHINESE FIREWORKS FACTORY
text: An oriental-looking building. A statue of a red dragon hangs
text: over its entrance.
scene_heading: INT. FACTORY
text: Dressed as three skunks, Rover, Mercury, and Benny roll
text: fireworks out of their boxes and into a brown sack.
text: But when Benny goes to scratch himself, one of the unlit
text: fireworks flies into the air. Fortunately, Rover catches it
text: just in time.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Careful, Benny!
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Sorry. But this costume itches.
dialog: (Sniffing himself)
dialog: And it smells bad too.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: You're supposed to smell bad. You’re a
dialog: SKUNK!
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Oh yeah ...
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (Holding up one of the bottle
dialog: rockets)
dialog: Mercury, are you sure this plan is going
dialog: to work?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Trust me. By the time we’re through,
dialog: those cats won’t know what hit ‘em.
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: INT. JULIET’S BEDROOM
text: Doc, dressed as a sexy cheetah, and Juliet, dressed as a
text: polar bear cub, put some last minute touches on their
dialog: costumes.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: How do I look?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Terrific. You’re going to
dialog: knock ‘em dead tonight, Doc.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Well, the cheetah is the
dialog: fastest cat on earth ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Zip me up.
text: Doc helps Juliet into her costume. It is now impossible to
text: tell that she is a cat.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAT-PULETS’ VILLA
text: The dogs, hidden entirely under their skunk costumes, follow
text: Mercury across the street to the party. The Cat-Pulets,
text: unaware of who they are, greet them at the door.
scene_heading: LADY CAT-PULET
dialog: My, what clever costumes.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: I’m smelly and I’m darn proud
dialog: of it!
text: Mercury suddenly notices that Benny’s tail is beginning to
text: stick out. He rushes to get Benny passed The Cat-Pulets.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Come on, big mouth.
scene_heading: INT. VILLA
text: The entire place is wall to wall with animals. An orchestra
text: made up of penguins plays classical music. Flyer, dressed as
text: a peacock, dances in mid-air with an eagle.
text: When the dogs enter, they make a bee-line for the buffet.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Get a load of this spread!
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Eat up, boys. In a few minutes, this
dialog: party’s going to be history.
dialog: 27.
text: MEANWHILE ...
text: Doc is surrounded by various animals who want to dance with
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Please don’t fight. I’m only one kitty!
text: Juliet smiles at her friend’s good fortune. But her smile
text: suddenly turns into a frown when she sees her parents and
text: VIENNA, a snobby Viennese bachelor cat, approaching.
scene_heading: LADY CAT-PULET
dialog: Juliet, you remember Vienna, don’t you?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (Grimacing)
dialog: Of course.
text: Vienna, dressed as a unicorn, smiles lasciviously.
speaker_heading: VIENNA
dialog: Juliet, how purr-fect you look tonight!
text: Vienna bends down to kiss Juliet’s paw but pokes her with his
text: horn. Juliet screams.
speaker_heading: VIENNA
dialog: I’m soooo sorry! I’m not used to being
dialog: mythological.
text: Vienna laughs at his own lame joke. Juliet’s had just about
dialog: enough of this drip.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Will you excuse me? I think I see a
dialog: monkey I know by the buffet.
scene_heading: ON THE DANCE FLOOR
text: The orchestra finishes its song. The animals applaud.
scene_heading: PENGUIN ORCHESTRA LEADER
dialog: The boys and I are going to take five for
text: a couple of ice cubes.
text: Flyer’s dance partner smiles and gives him a peck on the
text: cheek as she flies off. He sighs and looks at his peacock
dialog: feathers.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: This is the one night each year when
dialog: nobody's afraid of me.
text: (Looking over at his dance
dialog: partner)
dialog: I sure wouldn’t mind another.
text: AT THE BUFFET TABLE
dialog: 28.
text: The dogs are seriously digging in. But as Rover reaches
text: across the table, his black, skunk paw accidentally bumps
text: into a white, furry one. He looks up and finds none other
dialog: than Juliet herself.
text: Their eyes meet and it is LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Wow ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You have the most amazing eyes.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: So do you.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You can tell a lot about someone from
text: their eyes.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Oh yeah? What do mine say?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: That you’re honest ...
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Uh .. well ... usually.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: And that you’re looking for something.
dialog: Or maybe, someone.
text: Rover and Juliet stare at one another, transfixed.
text: Just then, the orchestra starts up again.
speaker_heading: JULIET (cont'd)
dialog: Would you like to dance ...?
text: Rover is tempted, then looks over at Mercury and Benny
dialog: and remembers why he is here.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Oh I don’t know ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Come on. It’s easy. And besides, when’s
dialog: the next time you’re going to see a polar
text: bear and a skunk dancing together?
text: Rover smiles, then gets pulled onto the dance floor by
text: Juliet. A formal, Renaissance-like dance begins. Rover
text: looks around awkwardly, uncertain what to do. Trying to
text: mimic what the others are doing, Rover steps right on
text: Juliet’s foot! It’s all Juliet can do to keep from crying
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I’m sorry!
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: It’s all right ... Don’t worry about the
dialog: others.
text: She turns his face to hers.
speaker_heading: JULIET (cont'd)
dialog: Look at me.
text: Looking into those eyes, a kind of miracle comes over Rover.
text: He boldly twirls Juliet with precision.
speaker_heading: JULIET (cont'd)
dialog: That’s it!
text: In no time, Rover and Juliet are dazzling everyone at the
text: party with their dancing prowess. The Cat-Pulets dancing
text: nearby can’t even begin to keep up with them.
text: As the song ends, the spectators applaud for Rover and
text: Juliet. Rover leads her off the dance floor away from the
dialog: other Cat-Pulets.
speaker_heading: JULIET (cont'd)
dialog: I'd say you’re a natural.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I'd say you’re a great teacher.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Not that good.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: In your arms, anything seems possible.
text: Rover looks at Juliet strangely.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Or should I say, “in your paws”, or “in
dialog: your wings”?
text: She looks back at him furtively.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Are you trying to figure out what I am?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Maybe so.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: That's strictly against the rules, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I like breaking rules.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Well, these aren’t wings. I’m no
dialog: chicken, that’s for sure.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Are you a lamb?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: A rabbit?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: A goat?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (Coyly)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Oh come on! I just have to know.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Just have to, huh? What do you say ...
text: (An idea comes over her)
dialog: .-. I show you instead?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Are you just going to take off your mask?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I will if you will.
text: Rover gulps and looks around fearfully.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Here?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: How about we go to the garden instead?
dialog: I’m kinda shy.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: All right, then. 1I/’11 meet you there in
text: five minutes.
text: Juliet hurries off. Rover almost swoons.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I’m in love!
text: Mercury appears in a huff.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: What gives, Rover? We’re here to do some
dialog: damage, not win a dance contest.
dialog: 31.
text: Rover sees Juliet walk outside.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I know, I know ... but I think the polar
dialog: bear is on to us. I’m just trying to
dialog: keep her ... distracted.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Well hurry it up. Benny’s setting up the
dialog: pyrotechnics
dialog: even as we speak.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN
text: Under the starry night, Juliet awaits her true love. Rover
text: sneaks up from behind and places his paws over her eyes.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Guess who?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: The animal of my dreams?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Close enough.
text: Rover walks around in front of Juliet.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Ready ... ?
text: Rover looks around one last time to make sure that the coast
text: is clear.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Let’s do it.
speaker_heading: JULIET
text: On the count of three.
dialog: One ...
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Two ...
speaker_heading: JULIET/ROVER
dialog: Three!
text: Rover and Juliet lift their masks. Both are shocked.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: YOU'RE A DOG?!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: YOU'RE A CAT?!
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What are you doing at my family’s party?
dialog: You must know we, I mean they, hate dogs.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: You mean you don’t hate dogs too?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I can’t hate someone I don’t even know.
dialog: That would be silly.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I guess you’re right.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: So what are we going to do? I mean it
dialog: seemed like we were sort of becoming, I
dialog: don’t know ... friends.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: 32.
dialog: Yeah, it sure seemed that way. But I just
dialog: don’t think the world’s ready for a cat
text: and a dog being ... friends.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yeah, I guess not.
text: Both are terribly saddened by this realization.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Well, see ya...
text: Rover puts on his mask and starts back inside.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Hey ... I don’t even know
dialog: your name.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: It’s Rover.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I’m Juliet.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (Gesturing to the balcony)
dialog: You mean like the girl ...?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Rover and Juliet. I like that.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I like that too.
speaker_heading: ROVER
text: Though it does sound vaguely familiar ..
text: Juliet smiles, slightly.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: ROVER (cont'd)
dialog: Well ... ‘Night, Juliet.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Good night, Rover.
text: Rover leaves. A single tear drop falls from Juliet’s eye.
scene_heading: INT. VILLA
text: Rover meets up with Mercury and Benny.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Where have you been?! The fireworks are
text: just about to begin.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: You know, Merc’, I don’t think this is
dialog: such a good idea after all. I mean,
dialog: maybe The Cat-Pulets aren’t so bad ...
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Are you nuts? We’re finally going to
dialog: give these stuck up house-fluffers what
dialog: they deserve.
text: Mercury jumps onto a chair.
speaker_heading: MERCURY (cont'd)
dialog: Listen up, animals of Verona! It’s time
dialog: for tonight’s entertainment, courtesy of
dialog: the three muske-skunks. Hit it, Benny!
text: Benny pushes down on a GIANT BOMB PLUNGER, setting off the
text: fireworks and bottle rockets. It is chaos as the animals
text: panic and try to flee. In the confusion, Rover finds Juliet.
text: He pulls off his mask.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Juliet, I’m sorry. I tried to stop them.
dialog: I really did.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I believe you, Rover. But you better
dialog: leave before my family gets their hands
dialog: on you.
text: Rover and Juliet desperately want to kiss before parting, but
dialog: can’t.
text: As Rover flees the mayhem, Tyger spots him.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: I knew it! The Mongrels!
text: As Tyger starts to go after Rover, Lord Cat-pulet stops him.

speaker_heading: FLYER

text: When one of his elongated wings hits a tree branch, Flyer
text: plummets to the earth.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
text: And he falls with a tremendous splash in a bird bath. He

speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)

dialog: love.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: But Rover that’s wonderful! You've
dialog: wanted to be in love forever!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I know, I know, but ...
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: But what?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: -.. it’s with a ... Cat-Pulet!
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: You mean Juliet?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: (Confused)
dialog: And that’s a problem?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Flyer! She’s a cat!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: And I’m a dog!
text: Flyer gives Rover a perplexed look.
speaker_heading: ROVER (cont'd)
dialog: Can’t you see? I don’t think the world
text: is ready for a dog-cat relationship.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: The world? Rover, since when have you
dialog: ever worried about what the world thinks,
dialog: huh?
text: Flyer looks at Rover, but the dog lowers his eyes.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: This is more about what you think, isn’t
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I’m just so confused. I don’t know if I
dialog: should ... I don’t even know if I could
dialog: -+- Do you know any dog who would ...?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Love a cat?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Yeah.
text: Rover shakes his head and walks away from Flyer dejected.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Rover ...
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: What?
text: Flyer finally has his entire costume off and flies over and
text: lands in front Rover.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Rover!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Let me ask you something. When you look
dialog: at me, what do you see?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: What do you mean, what do I see? I see
dialog: you. Flyer.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: And do you see that I’m a bat?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Of course, I see that you’re a bat.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: So then why aren’t you ...
text: Flyer bares his pathetically short fangs, not looking even
dialog: remotely frightening ...
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: -.. afraid of me, huh?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Why would I ever be afraid of you?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Because a lot of creatures think I’m
dialog: scary.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: They do?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Oh yeah, they don’t even like me being
dialog: around.
text: Flyer takes a hop toward a couple of squirrels, who
text: immediately scram in opposite directions.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: See what I mean? Without that peacock
dialog: costume I would never have gotten in to
dialog: the animal ball tonight.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: But why are they afraid of you?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I don’t know. Maybe ...
text: Flyer flies under a dark awning and hangs upside down.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: ... it’s because we like hanging upside
text: down in the dark.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: What’s scary about that?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Beats me.
text: Flyer comes back down to Rover now.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Maybe they think we carry germs or
dialog: something, or we’re sneaky because we fly
dialog: so quiet. Did you know that some
dialog: creatures even think we’re evil?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Evil?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Oh yeah. Four hundred years from now
dialog: they’re going to be making all these
dialog: movies about bats who turn into vampires
dialog: and bite people’s necks and say ...
dialog: Flyer does his best Bela Lugosi.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: “I vant to suck your blood.”
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: But that’s ridiculous! You don’t want to
dialog: suck anybody’s blood. You’re not a
dialog: vampire! And you don’t carry germs
dialog: either. You’re the cleanest, most honest
dialog: creature in Verona. How could anybody
dialog: think that you are scary?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I don’t know, but somehow they do.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Well, that’s crazy!
text: Flyer touches Rover’s paw with his wing.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Rover, it’s easy for you to see that it’s
dialog: crazy when it’s between bats and other
dialog: animals. But can you see that it’s crazy
dialog: also when its between cats and dogs?
text: Rover looks into the sky as if he’s been struck by
text: lightening.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: My goodness, you're right. It doesn’t
dialog: matter if we’re different. What matters
dialog: is ... is...
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: What’s in your hearts.
text: Rover looks back at Flyer.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Well, I know what’s in mine.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I guess there’s only one thing left to
dialog: find out then, isn’t there?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Yes, absolutely! Thank you, Flyer!
dialog: Thank you!
text: Rover sets of down the street at a full sprint. Flyer
text: watches him go happily.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: ‘Atta boy.
scene_heading: INT. JULIET’S BEDROOM
text: Doc is helping Juliet slip out of her polar bear costume when
text: she begins to notice that Juliet seems very depressed about
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Are you all right, Juliet? You haven’t
dialog: said a word since the party.
text: But it is as if Juliet is in a dream.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I’m sorry. What did you say, Rover?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Rover!
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I’m sorry, did I say Rover?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Yes, you did. I’ve been called a lot of
dialog: things in my day, but Rover isn’t one of
dialog: them. Juliet ...
text: Doc lifts Juliet’s chin.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Have you been rubbing whiskers with with
dialog: one of the canine persuasion?
dialog: 39.
text: Juliet hides her eyes from Doc, but she knows there’s no use
text: trying to hide the truth from her.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yes, I have. I met him at the party. We
dialog: talked. We danced. But in the end ...
dialog: (starting to cry)
dialog: Oh Rover, Rover, wherefore art thou
dialog: Rover!
text: Doc takes a tissue from the vanity table and dries Juliet’s
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh Doc, you won’t tell anyone, will you?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Of course not. We love kittens got to
dialog: stick together. Just don’t let Tyger
dialog: find out.
text: At that moment A LONELY HOWL is heard outside the house.
text: Juliet crosses to the window and looks down into the street.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: It’s Rover!
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Rover?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh my goodness!
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Hey, he’s kind of cute.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Well, for a dog...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh, Doc, what am I going to do?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Go out and talk to him.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Talk to him? What do I say?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Say, “Hey ya big boy, why don’t you come
dialog: up and see me some time?”
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I can’t say that!
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Then just be yourself. You'll be fine.
text: Juliet opens the window and slips out on the balcony. Rover
text: clears his throat and begins to speak.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: But soft! What light from over yonder
text: comes and breaks my window.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: That’s not right. I mean what yonder
dialog: broke my light ... I mean my window ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Rover, what are you saying?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I’m saying ...
text: He looks up at her suddenly full of confidence.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I’m saying that I love you.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I love you, Juliet. And I want to know
dialog: if you love me too. Because if you do,
dialog: then all the differences between us will
dialog: mean nothing.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh Rover, I do love you. Very much.
text: Rover suddenly flies into a series of back flips. Juliet
text: laughs delightedly.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Come to me, Rover.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Come to you?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Jump up here.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I can’t jump up there.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Because I can’t jump that high. I'ma
dialog: dog, remember?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh. So what do we do?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: You’re going to have to come down here.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: But I can’t do that.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Because I’ve never been out of the house
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: You've never seen Verona? The most
dialog: beautiful town in the world?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Then come with me Juliet, and I will show
dialog: it to you, and you will have the most
dialog: wonderful night of your life.
text: Juliet looks at Doc questioningly.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Doc?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Just don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: But there isn’t anything you wouldn’t do.
text: Doc smiles mischievously.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Exactly.
text: Taking one last look into her bedroom, Juliet turns and
text: dashes off the balcony. She leaps high into the air and
text: lands right beside Rover. After looking dreamily into his
text: eyes, Juliet finally shrugs shyly.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Verona, remember?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Oh yes ... Verona. And what would you
dialog: like to see first?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: All of it. I want to see all of it.
text: And with that the happy couple darts off into the city, paw
text: in paw. Flyer, who has been observing the young lovers from
text: a tree limb, flaps behind them.
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA STREETS - NIGHT
text: A moment later, Rover and Juliet are SWINGING AROUND LAMP
text: POSTS and DANCING IN THE STREETS. Juliet is, of course,
text: fascinated by everything she sees, but especially by the orbs
text: of light and the oranges and other round fruits she sees
text: through a market's window.
text: Overcome with chivalry, Rover sneaks in the back door of the
text: market and returns a minute later with a couple of nectarines
dialog: that he’s pawned.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Where to next?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (Pointing to the fruit)
dialog: Throw it.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Throw it!
text: Rover FLINGS the nectarine down the street. Juliet points in
text: the direction it has gone.
speaker_heading: JULIET (cont'd)
dialog: I want to go there!
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: Rover and Juliet have caught up with the rolling fruit.
text: Laughing and giggling, they kick it on further ... straight
text: down the sidewalk and into the opera house.
text: Outside the front door, Rover and Juliet dodge the legs of
text: people entering the opera house. Slowly a DEVILISH GRIN
text: spreads across Juliet’s face and she bolts into the opera
text: house after the nectarine. Rover is right behind her!
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE
text: The nectarine is being inadvertently kicked around the front
text: lobby. Before Rover and Juliet can catch up to it though, it
text: is kicked down a back hallway toward a dressing room.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM
text: Rover and Juliet tear after the bouncing nectarine only to
text: become accidentally entangled in TWO ELABORATE COSTUMES.
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE AT THE OPERA
text: The nectarine continues to roll just out of reach of Rover
text: and Juliet who have now come to be wearing the elaborate
dialog: costumes!
scene_heading: INT. THE OPERA HOUSE STAGE
text: Finally the nectarine comes to rest ... downstage center!
text: A second later Rover and Juliet catch up to it there. Then
text: the lights go down. A HUSH falls over the audience.
text: The CONDUCTOR taps his baton and clears his throat. All eyes
text: fall _on Rover and Juliet, who look at one another.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What are we supposed to do now?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Sing, I think.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Sing what?
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: Your first line is “Figaro.”
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Figaro?
text: Suddenly the orchestra springs to life. Beautiful music
text: fills the chamber. But Rover and Juliet struggle to sing
dialog: operatically.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Figaro! Figaro!
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Figaro!
text: Suddenly, two underwear clad opera singers appear onstage and
text: begin chasing Rover and Juliet around.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTANICAL GARDEN - SECONDS LATER
text: Finally making it back outside the opera house, Rover jumps
text: into a flowerbed and begins picking roses and daisies left
text: and right. Soon he has made a gigantic bouquet, which he
text: presents proudly to Juliet. As Rover and Juliet come out of
text: the garden, a delightful smell wafts by and tempts their
text: noses.
scene_heading: EXT. BAKERY
text: Following the smell down the street, they come to “Domino’s
text: Bakery.” Peering in the front window, they see a young
text: APPRENTICE taking loaves of bread from the oven.
dialog: 44,
scene_heading: INT. BAKERY
text: Unable to resist the smell of the fresh-baked bread, Rover
text: and Juliet sneak into the bakery and creep nearer and nearer
dialog: the bread.
text: But then Rover accidentally swats a pepper shaker with his
text: tail, making the Apprentice sneeze. The just risen loaves of
text: bread fall as flat as pancakes. The baker, SENOR DOMINO,
text: becomes incensed and swats the Apprentice with his hat.
text: A chase around the bakery begins, where the TOMATO and
text: MOZZARELLA, which the baker was eating for supper, end up
text: being spread on the FLATTENED LOAVES OF BREAD.
text: Just as Senor Domino has the Apprentice cornered, he smells
text: the PIE SHAPED CREATION on top of the stove.
text: Suddenly he has an idea and cuts the pie into TRIANGULAR
text: PIECES. After smelling one curiously, he plops it in his
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: SENOR DOMINO
dialog: Hey, that’s pretty good!
text: As Senor Domino chomps down another bite, the Apprentice
text: flattens out a bread box, making the first pizza box.
speaker_heading: APPRENTICE
dialog: Wait a second, I got it! We’1ll deliver!
speaker_heading: SENOR DOMINO
dialog: We'll call it Domino's!
text: In their joy of their new discovery, they don’t notice how
text: Rover creeps up to the stove ... and swipes the first pizza
dialog: in the history of the world!
text: On the way out the door, Juliet snatches the Apprentice’s
dialog: bottle of milk, too!
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER - MOMENTS LATER
text: Rover and Juliet are riding in a gondola down the river,
text: eating the pizza and drinking the milk and being serenaded by
text: a quartet of string-playing crickets.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: It would go great with a little
dialog: pepperoni, wouldn’t you say?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I think I'd prefer anchovies.
text: When they come to an arched bridge, Rover takes Juliet’s paw
dialog: and they're off again.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Come on!
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA STREETS - LATER
text: Rover and Juliet continue their happy romp through town.
text: Soon, they come to the Arena. Rover runs right through the
text: front door.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: It’s the Arena!
scene_heading: EXT. INSIDE THE ARENA
text: Rover and Juliet scamper up to the emperor’s box and look at
text: the Roman ruins around them.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Can you imagine what it was like back
dialog: then?
text: Suddenly, magically, the Arena is transformed into its
dialog: classical glory!
scene_heading: TOGA-CLAD SPECTATORS are doing “the wave”. GLADIATORS
text: prepare to fight EXOTIC BEASTS. A wreathed sports announcer
text: looking an awful lot like Marv Albert does the play by play.
text: In an instant, a WOOLY MAMMOTH charges at a gladiator in the
text: center of the ring. The gladiator is ROVER!
text: Rover, however is too enamored of Juliet and doesn’t notice
text: the tusked beast bearing down on him. Juliet meows ...!
text: Just in time! Rover leaps to the side, using a toga as a
text: Matador uses a cape. Within seconds, Rover has brought the
text: beast to the ground, and has wrapped its trunk around its
text: feet like a cowboy ropes a calf. Juliet tosses roses to
text: Rover, who picks them up with his teeth.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLS ABOVE VERONA - DAYBREAK
text: An instant later, Rover and Juliet are dashing for the hills.
text: It’s all Flyer can do to keep up with them.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF THE HILL - SUNRISE
text: Rover and Juliet sit side by side with all of Verona below
text: them. The sun is just coming up. They look deep into one
dialog: another’s eyes ...
text: Just as they begin to move closer to one another, Flyer comes
text: to the top of the hill and is hit by direct sunlight. This
text: knocks his RADAR all out of whack and he promptly crashes
text: into a CHICKEN COOP getting egg all over himself.
text: Back on the top of the hill, meanwhile, all the other animals
text: (except dogs and cats of course) have gathered around to see
text: Rover and Juliet move CLOSER and CLOSER.
dialog: 46.
text: When the young lovers kiss, it is like all of Italy sighs
dialog: with them.
text: Just seconds later, Flyer gets to the scene.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Darn, I missed the best part.
text: Rover and Juliet look at him and then back at one another.
text: When they kiss again, Flyer literally shivers with happiness.
text: Then they turn, paw in paw, and watch the sunlight continue
text: to spread over Verona.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING
text: Verona still sleeps as Rover and Juliet return home from
text: their adventure. When they reach The Cat-Pulets’ villa, the
text: two young lovers stop at its gates and look at each other,
text: longingly.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Well ... Here we are.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: Home.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Last night was amazing.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I‘1l never forget it as long
dialog: as I live.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I won’t either.
text: Juliet starts under the gate.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I just wish ...
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I just wish we could do this every night.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: And every day, too.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: But if our families ever found out ...
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: We'd never get to see each other again.
text: The lovers tremble merely at the thought.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: This feud is so dumb! I mean, cats and
dialog: dogs aren't so different.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: We both walk on four legs ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: We both have tails ...
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: We both fall in love.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Yeah ... We both do, don’t we.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: You know, maybe there is a way we can be
dialog: together and stop our two families from
dialog: fighting.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: But how?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Come with me. To the cathedral!
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL
text: A glorious renaissance church in the heart of Verona. THE
text: CAMERA TRACKS UP the facade of the cathedral right into its
text: bell tower.
scene_heading: INT. BELFRY
text: Flyer hangs upside down from the rafters, reading ‘How to Win
text: Friends and Influence Animals.’ Rover and Juliet stand below.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: (Throwing down his book)
dialog: You want me to WHAT?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I want you to marry us.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Don’t you think you’re moving just a
dialog: little fast?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: It’s the only way, Flyer. Romeo told me
dialog: that he and the girl Juliet were going to
dialog: be married in the church ...
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: They were. The Friar performed the
dialog: ceremony. It was a small but lovely
dialog: affair.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Romeo also said that getting married
dialog: would help end the feud between their two
dialog: families.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I gotta hand it to the boy,
text: he’s sharp.
text: Rover and Juliet look up at Flyer, knowingly.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: Oh ... I get it. You think you two could
dialog: do the same for cats and dogs.
text: The lovers smile and nod.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: Maybe, but I’m not a friar.
dialog: I’m just a bat who lives in the belfry.
dialog: That’s what bats do.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Please, Flyer. If it weren’t for you,
dialog: Juliet and I wouldn’t even be together.
dialog: All you have to do is say a few words.
dialog: Nothing fancy.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I don’t know ...
text: Juliet notices the title of Flyer’s book and gets an idea.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Come on, Rover. Let’s go home. He’s just
text: an old, scary-looking bat.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Now wait a second, young lady.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: It’s not like he wants to help end the
dialog: feud between cats and dogs. I mean then
dialog: everybody would like him. Nobody would be
text: afraid of him anymore.
text: Juliet’s reverse-psychology works. Flyer swoops down from
text: the ceiling and stops them.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I guess I could say a few words. I have
dialog: watched enough weddings in my day.
text: Rover and Juliet smile.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Come. Gather close.
text: Flyer hovers in front of the couple.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Do you, Rover, take Juliet to be your
dialog: wife?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: You bet I do!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: And do you, Juliet, take Rover to be your
dialog: husband?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Yes. I do.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Then by the power you have vested in me,
dialog: I now pronounce you ... cat and dog. You
dialog: may kiss the kitty.
text: They kiss. As if on cue, the CHURCH BELLS begin to ring!
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING
text: Rover and Juliet climb out the window and onto the street.
text: Suddenly, RICE begins to fall on their heads. They both look
text: up and find Flyer clutching a bag.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: What’s a wedding without rice?
text: They smile and wave. Rover notices the people on the street.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Wow, I better get you home.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No, Rover. We better split up. At least
dialog: until we tell our families the news.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Then we can be together whenever we want.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I can’t wait!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I’1l meet you back at your house with the
dialog: rest of The Mongrels. I think we should
dialog: tell everyone together.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I agree. Farewell, Rover. Parting is
dialog: such sweet sorrow.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Hey, that’s kinda nice ...
text: They sneak a final kiss and Juliet dashes off. Rover is left
text: with a huge smile on his face.
dialog: 50.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA - MORNING
text: Once again, the market place is bustling with people.
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE WATCHMAKER’S KIOSK
text: Benny, Mercury and Big Daddy wait impatiently. Benny
text: snatches one of the watchmaker’s watches and checks the time.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Where do you think Rover is?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Don’t ask me. But he was acting pretty
dialog: strange at the party last night.
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY
dialog: Speaking of The Cat-Pulet’s party, I
dialog: heard what you boys did.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: You should have seen it, Big Daddy. It
dialog: was great!
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY
dialog: No, Benny, it was stupid. Now all of the
dialog: other animals probably hate us as much as
dialog: the cats do. You pups need to pick your
text: fights more carefully.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: But Big Daddy, those cats -
text: Big Daddy rises over Mercury.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Sorry, Big Daddy. We’1l be more careful.
dialog: I promise.
text: Rover finally arrives.
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY
dialog: And where have you been? You’re late.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I... IT... I...
text: Big Daddy waits for an explanation.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Overslept?
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: Good answer.
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY
dialog: Because of your failure to pull off the
dialog: butcher heist, Rover, The Mongrels went
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY (cont'd)
dialog: hungry. That’s not going to happen
dialog: again ...
dialog: (Looming over Rover)
dialog: Is_it?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: No, Big Daddy.
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY
dialog: Today I’m sending you three on a mission
dialog: even the dumbest dogs could do.
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE PIAZZA
text: Tyger and his henchcats watch as The Mongrels sneak across
text: the marketplace. Tyger wears a gold WHISTLE around his neck.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Well if it isn’t our little friends the
dialog: skunks ...
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Something is smelly in The State of
dialog: Denmark.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: We’re in Verona, you idiot!
speaker_heading: SPEARE
dialog: Et tu, Ty-gre?
text: Tyger WHACKS them both across the head.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: SHUT UP! I have a plan to insure every
text: mongrel in Verona thinks twice before
text: messing with The Cat-Pulets again.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND THE MEAT STAND
text: The dogs pick through the scraps. Mercury finds a T-Bone.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Look at this beauty!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I better find one, too. I need to be on
dialog: Big Daddy's good side today.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: What’s so special about today?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I have something important to tell the
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Oh yeah? So tell us.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Well ...
text: Rover decides if he wants to spill the beans.
speaker_heading: TYGER (0.S.)
dialog: Yes. Tell us, Rover.
text: The dogs look up and find the cats right behind them.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Tell us all what’s so important.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: So I see you brought your goons this
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Goons?
speaker_heading: SPEARE
dialog: He is a dog of most infinite jest.
text: Tyger hisses at Shake and Speare. Then he approaches
dialog: Mercury.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: I have some unfinished business with you
text: Mongrels. A little payback for crashing
dialog: our party.
text: Rover gets between Tyger and Mercury.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Listen, we’re all very sorry about what
dialog: we did, Tyger.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: What are you doing, Rover? These
dialog: fluffballs don’t deserve an apology.
dialog: They deserve a nice bite on the behind.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: No, Mercury. Fighting isn’t the answer.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Oh yeah? Then what is?
text: Everyone looks at Rover.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Love.
text: The cats and dogs break out in hysterics.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: This little doggie’s nuts!
text: Benny steps forward and joins Rover.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Maybe Rover's right.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Benny!
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: I don’t like fighting, Merc’. It’s really
dialog: stupid. And for me, that’s saying a lot.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Looks like The Mongrels aren’t so tough
dialog: after all.
text: Mercury sticks his face up to Tyger’s.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Just try me, Pussy.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Remember what Big Daddy said, Merc’. We
dialog: have to choose our fights more carefully.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: He's right, Merc’. Just take
text: the bone and walk away.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: What’s it going to be? Are you a dog ...
dialog: or a chicken?
text: Mercury is ready to attack, but surprisingly, he steps back.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: You ain’t worth it, Tyger.
text: Mercury turns around and starts to walk away when suddenly
text: TYGER POUNCES ON HIM, running his razor sharp claws down
text: Mercury’s back. He draws blood.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Why you ...!
text: The henchcats grab Rover and Benny. Tyger has Mercury on his
text: back while he continues to claw him.
text: Rover can’t stand to watch his friend being hurt. With all
text: of his might, he shoves the henchcats to the ground and jumps
text: on top of Tyger, pulling him off of Mercury. Rover gets
text: Tyger pinned down. He opens his jaws, ready to bite the
dialog: vicious cat.
speaker_heading: ROVER (cont'd)
dialog: I don’t want to have to bite you, Tyger!
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Believe me, you’re not going
dialog: to get the chance!
dialog: 54.
text: Tyger BLOWS on his gold whistle. At first, Rover doesn’t
text: understand why. Then the sound of a horse approaching fast
text: is heard. Rover looks up and sees ...
text: ..- THE DOG CATCHER, his silver net in the air. Before Rover
text: can run away, the net swoops down and scoops him up. The Dog
text: Catcher holds Rover to his face.
speaker_heading: DOG CATCHER
dialog: Gotcha, Mongrel! I told you I would.
dialog: Fortunately, someone left me this
dialog: anonymous note ...
text: Rover sees the note. Written sloppily, it reads, ‘IF YOU
text: WANT TO FIND THE MONGRELS IN THE PIAZZA, JUST LISTEN FOR THE
speaker_heading: WHISTLE.’
text: Rover looks down at Tyger grinning. He holds up his paws.
text: It is covered in BLACK INK. The gold whistle is still in his
text: mouth. The Dog Catcher gallops off with Rover. Benny and
text: Mercury can only watch helplessly as their friend is taken
dialog: away.
scene_heading: INT. DOG POUND
text: The place is jam-packed with stray dogs. When The Dog Catcher
text: attempts to shove Rover into one of the already crowded
text: cages, the frightened pup pops right out. The Dog Catcher
text: grabs Rover by a tuft of fur and holds him up to his face.
speaker_heading: DOG CATCHER
dialog: Well, it looks like it’s your lucky day,
text: poochy. No room at the pound.
text: The Dog Catcher brings Rover close.
speaker_heading: DOG CATCHER (cont’d)
dialog: Now what shall I do with you, hmm? I
dialog: hear in some countries, little doggies
dialog: are a delicacy.
text: Rover shivers in terror.
speaker_heading: DOG CATCHER (cont’d)
dialog: No. You're too small to cook. I have a
dialog: better idea.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY
text: The Mongrels gather around Mama Mongrel as she licks
text: Mercury’s wounds.
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: What the Cat-Pulets did today is an act
dialog: of war! From this day forth, let no
text: feline feel safe in Verona. The Mongrels
dialog: are fighting back!
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: INT. VILLA
text: The Cat-Pulets gather in the living room. Lady Cat-Pulet
text: licks Tyger’s wounds.
scene_heading: LORD CAT-PULET
dialog: What the Mongrels did today is an act of
dialog: war! From this day forth, let no canine
dialog: feel safe in Verona.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Don’t worry, father. The Dog Catcher
dialog: took care of the Mongrel that attacked
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (Concerned)
dialog: What was the name of the dog?
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Rover. How cliché.
text: Juliet is in shock. She turns to Doc.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: I can’t believe Rover would do something
dialog: like that.
scene_heading: LORD CAT-PULET
dialog: Our mortal enemy has always been the dog.
dialog: And now you can see why. It’s time The
dialog: Cat-Pulets fought back!
text: The Cat-Pulets meow in agreement, then follow Lord Cat-Pulet
text: out of the room. As Juliet is leaving, she overhears Tyger
text: and his henchcats.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: It was pretty clever how I made it look
dialog: like Rover attacked me just as the dog
dialog: catcher came by.
text: Tyger laughs devilishly. Juliet now knows the truth.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Juliet runs in and grabs Doc.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Doc, Tyger set Rover up! My husband is
dialog: innocent! Go to the pound and tell Rover
dialog: I know the truth and that I still love
dialog: him. I just hope he’s all right ...
scene_heading: EXT. GATES OF VERONA - NIGHT
text: The Dog Catcher rides just outside the city and drops Rover
text: on a dirt road.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: DOG CATCHER
dialog: Hit the road, mutt. You’re banished!
dialog: And if I ever see your grubby little face
dialog: again, you'll be meat for my meatballs.
dialog: NOW BEAT IT!
text: Rover starts down the road. The Dog Catcher rides back into
text: the city. The gates slam shut behind him.
text: Rover stops and turns around.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I’m not going anywhere without seeing
dialog: Juliet one last time ...
scene_heading: EXT. JUST INSIDE CITY WALLS - HOURS LATER
text: A furious scratching is heard beneath the earth. After a
text: moment Rover pokes his head out. He’s burrowed his way under
text: the wall and comes out completely covered in mud. He’s even
text: got dirt in his mouth.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Patooie! Yeeech!
text: He looks up at the high wall towering above him.
speaker_heading: ROVER (cont'd)
dialog: Man, I need to learn to jump.
text: Shaking himself off as best he can, Rover starts off for the
text: Cat-Pulets’, but no sooner is he on the road than he sees a
text: BLACK HORSE APPROACHING AT A THUNDERING PACE.
speaker_heading: ROVER (cont'd)
dialog: Oh no! The Dog-Catcher!
text: Rover leaps from the road and buries himself in a pile of
text: leaves, only to discover that the horse is being ridden by a
text: cute little boy. Getting up cautiously, Rover slinks from
text: lamp post to lamp post completely covered in leaves. It
text: looks as though he’s been tarred and feathered.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF VERONA - LATER
text: Nearing the piazza, Rover turns a corner and heads down a
text: street leading to the Cat-Pulets’. Again, we hear a horse
text: approaching. This time it is the Dog Catcher, but Rover has
text: hidden himself in the shadows.
text: The Dog Catcher is more menacing than ever, now wielding a
text: whip and striking at any animal in the street.
speaker_heading: DOG-CATCHER
dialog: Yee-ah! Yee-ah!
text: The Rats, who are having supper in the alley, are nearly
text: lashed by the whip. After the Dog Catcher is gone, they
text: return to their meal. Rover listens in.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: FIRST RAT
dialog: Hey, what’s up with Igor?
speaker_heading: SECOND RAT
dialog: Ah, he’s mad about pulling a double
dialog: shift. Ever since that dumb mutt started
text: the riot in the square.
speaker_heading: FIRST RAT
dialog: You mean Rover?
speaker_heading: SECOND RAT
dialog: That's his name. You should have heard
dialog: the Cat-Pulets cursing him when I was up
dialog: there stealing this cheese. Every one of
dialog: them! That mutt better not go anywhere
dialog: near that place, let me tell you.
dialog: (Gesturing to his plate)
dialog: Rougefort?
speaker_heading: FIRST RAT
dialog: Why thank you.
text: Rover walks away from the rats dejected. Finding a puddle of
text: water, he looks at his reflection.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (To himself)
dialog: Every one of the Cat-Pulets! Do you
dialog: think ... Juliet could hate me too?
text: Rover looks up at the Cat-Pulets’ house and ponders for a
text: second. Then he turns and runs down the street in the
text: opposite direction.
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA STREET - LATER
text: Doc is walking down the street muttering to herself.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Can you imagine? A cat on the way to the
dialog: pound? Just think what this will do to
dialog: my reputation?
text: When she turns the corner, Doc sees Rover sprinting down the
text: street still partially covered in leaves.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (To herself)
dialog: Rover?! Where you off to in such a
dialog: hurry?
text: Doc looks down a hill and can see that Rover is heading
text: straight for the cathedral. Sighing, she sets off after him.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: From the pound to the church. Talk about
dialog: out of your element!
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: INT. BELFRY
text: Flyer stands before a mirror combing his hair with dippity-do
dialog: hair gel.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Maybe if I part it on the side, nobody
dialog: will think I’m so...
text: Suddenly, Rover enters the church window and leaps into the
dialog: belfry.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (Panting)
dialog: Flyer? Where are you Flyer?
text: Flyer hides his hair gel and tries to flatten down his hair.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I’m right here. What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I’ve been vanished!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Vanished? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Like from Verona.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Oh you mean “banished”.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Because I got in a fight with Tyger, only
dialog: it wasn’t my fault, but then the dog
dialog: catcher came, and he thought it was my
dialog: fault, but it wasn’t, I swear. I swear!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Rover, you shouldn’t swear in church -
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: And now all the Cat-pulets hate me, even
dialog: Juliet! What am I going to do, Flyer?
dialog: What am I ever going to do?
text: Rover collapses in tears on the floor of the belfry. Flyer
text: looks down on him with irritation.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Come on, get up!
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I can’t. Can’t you see? My life is
dialog: over. Oh, woe is me!
text: Flyer decides to try a little reverse psychology.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Why you’re nothing but a hound dog,
dialog: crying all the time.
text: Rover looks up at Flyer, slightly indignant.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: A hound dog?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: There’s always hope, Rover. No matter
dialog: how bleak things look. You just got to
dialog: get up and keep trying.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: But what hope can there be for me now?
text: At that instant Doc appears at the window above Rover and
text: Flyer. She postures herself like a nightclub performer from
dialog: the 1940's.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Hey ya big boys. Why you look so glum?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Doc!
text: Rover leaps to his feet and rushes to the stairs below Doc.
text: As he starts to scramble up, Doc yells sharply.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Rover, stay where you are!
text: Rover freezes and looks up at Doc confused.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You’re ruining my big entrance.
text: And with that, Doc saunters down the steps with her tail
text: wrapped about her shoulders like a mink stole.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I bring word from my lady.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: What oh what, tell me please! Does she
dialog: hate me? Does she never want to see me
dialog: again? Tell me, please, I have to know.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Tell me something, do all dogs drool like
dialog: that?
dialog: 60.
text: It’s all Rover can do to keep from ringing Doc’s neck.
speaker_heading: ROVER
text: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT JULIET!
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Ah quit your yelping. She loves you
dialog: still.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (ecstatic)
dialog: She does?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: And she knows Tyger had you set up.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: She does?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: And she wants to see you as soon she can.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: She does?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: She does.
text: Rover scrambles toward the open window.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Then I’m going now!
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Just a second!
text: Rover pauses at the window.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You aren’t going to go looking like that
dialog: are you? For a golden retriever you’re
text: looking a little tarnished.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Don’t you worry, Doc. Don’t you worry.
text: Rover heads out of the belfry completely excited.
scene_heading: EXT. BENEATH JULIET THE GIRL’S BALCONY - NIGHT
text: Rover approaches the balcony thoroughly cleaned. He seems to
text: be on top of the world, until he remembers how high the
dialog: balcony is.
text: Seeing no other choice, he takes a few steps back and charges
dialog: 61.
text: toward the balcony. A few feet from the wall he makes a
text: tremendous leap ... but only makes it about half way up and
text: crashes back down to the ground.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Now what am I going to do?
text: Truly starting to become dejected, Rover’s spirits change
text: when he sees ROMEO APPROACH CARRYING A LADDER.
text: Romeo places the ladder against the balcony and begins to go
text: up but then thinks of something and goes back down. Then he
text: begins to look for something in the garden.
text: Rover takes advantage of the opportunity and scampers right
text: up the ladder. He is just about to steal into Juliet’s
text: chamber when he turns and discovers Romeo picking flowers for
text: Juliet the Girl in the garden.
text: Feeling like he needs to do the same for his Juliet, Rover
text: goes back down the ladder. Down in the garden, Romeo sees
dialog: Rover.
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Oh loyal pooch. Have you a fair maiden
dialog: of your own? Perchance a beagle? A
dialog: collie? And must you stake your very
dialog: life just to set eyes upon her? I think
dialog: not. How much simpler it would be to be
dialog: a lowly dog!
text: Romeo scratches Rover behind the ears and heads back to the
text: ladder with his bouquet. Once Romeo has gotten off the top,
text: Rover scrambles up behind him.
text: Just as both Romeo and Rover are about to enter their
text: respective entrances on the balcony, they are simultaneously
text: overcome with a teenager’s sense of insecurity.
text: Completely unaware that the other is doing the same thing at
text: the same time, both the dog and the boy look at their
text: reflections in the window and fix their hair.
text: Then they flex their biceps and blow into their hand/paw to
text: check for bad breath. Finally convinced that all is in
text: order, the lovers puff up their chests and make their
text: dashingly romantic entrances.
scene_heading: INT. JULIET THE GIRL’S BEDROOM
text: Both Juliet and Juliet the Girl are primping themselves as
text: the door to the balcony opens. The male lovers swagger in.
text: Juliet sees Rover ... Juliet the Girl sees Romeo ...
text: Both sets of lovers jump into each other’s arms!
scene_heading: INT. JULIET THE GIRL’S BEDROOM - DAYBREAK
text: Romeo and Juliet the Girl lay in one another’s arms on the
text: love seat. Meanwhile, underneath the bed, Rover and Juliet
dialog: do exactly the same thing.
dialog: 62.
text: After a moment, we hear A BIRD CALL.
scene_heading: ROVER AND JULIET’S POV
text: Romeo’s legs come off the bed and move to the window. A
text: moment later we hear the CURTAINS TORN OPEN and the room
text: fills with light.
speaker_heading: UNDER THE BED
text: Rover looks at Juliet, panicked at how late it’s gotten.
text: Pecking her on the cheek he gets up to go. Juliet grabs him
dialog: desperately just as ...
speaker_heading: JULIET THE GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet day.
text: Juliet squeezes Rover so tightly he begins to turn blue!
text: It's like she’s put a VICE around his neck ...
speaker_heading: ROMEO (0.S.)
dialog: I must be gone and live ...
text: Finally he breaks through Juliet’s clutches and catapults
text: across the room, knocking over an expensive lamp!
speaker_heading: ROMEO (0.S.)
dialog: «+. or stay and die.
text: ABOVE ...
text: Romeo and Juliet the Girl are so enamored of one another that
text: they haven’t noticed the lamp crash to the ground.
dialog: BELOW ...
text: Juliet has pounced on Rover again. He points out the window
dialog: desperately to the rising sun ...
speaker_heading: ROMEO (0.S.)
dialog: ‘Tis the morn. Look love ...
text: Juliet shakes her head and closes her eyes, childishly
text: refusing to acknowledge the morning.
speaker_heading: JULIET THE GIRL (0.S.)
text: Yond light is not day-light.
text: Suddenly, Juliet radically shifts tactics, lifting up the
text: blanket and casting a FLIRTATIOUS LOOK Rover's way.
speaker_heading: JULIET THE GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: Therefore stay yet, - thou need’st not to
dialog: be gone.
text: This is too much for Rover to resist and he dives under the
text: covers to be with Juliet.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: ROMEO (0.S.)
dialog: Let me be put to death! Juliet wills it
dialog: so. It is not day.
text: Suddenly Juliet is FRANTIC to get Rover out of the bedroom.
dialog: Only now Rover clings to Juliet!
speaker_heading: JULIET THE GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: It is, it is, - hie hence be gone, away!
text: She pushes Rover toward the window RIPPING up the bedsheets,
text: KNOCKING over the vanity table, and SMASHING the chest of
dialog: drawers.
text: In addition, the canopy from the bed has gotten caught on the
dialog: 
text: chandelier ...
text: Romeo and Juliet The Girl, meanwhile, still have ABSOLUTELY
text: NO IDEA the room is being literally DEMOLISHED!
speaker_heading: JULIET THE GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: --. O, now be gone; more light and light
text: it grows.
text: The Nurse and Doc enter simultaneously. Doc stares at the
text: destruction around her.
speaker_heading: NURSE (0.S.)
dialog: Your lady mother is coming to your
dialog: chamber: The day is broke;
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: So’s the lamp ...
speaker_heading: NURSE (0.S.)
dialog: Be wary! Look about!
text: The chandelier crashes to the ground! ... narrowly missing
text: all of the lovers, who are STILL oblivious to the room being
text: destroyed. They can only look deeply into one another’s
dialog: eyes ...
text: Finally, dramatically, Juliet the Girl opens the window.
scene_heading: JULIET THE GIRL
dialog: Then window, let day in, and let life
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ROMEO
dialog: Farewell, farewell! One kiss and I’1l
dialog: descend.
text: Both pairs of lovers kiss simultaneously. Then Rover and
text: Romeo head out the window and disappear into the street.
text: Juliet and Juliet the Girl watch them go sadly. Finally,
text: Juliet the Girl notices that Juliet is there.
dialog: 64.
scene_heading: JULIET THE GIRL
dialog: Oh Kitty Juliet, alack the day! Have you
dialog: a dashing prince far hence? Some Siamese
dialog: cat? Some Noble Persian? It must be so
dialog: much simpler to be a cat.
text: Both crying now, Juliet and Juliet the girl comfort one
dialog: another.
scene_heading: EXT. FARM IN MANTUA - ONE WEEK LATER
text: Rover has breakfast with the pigs at their trough.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I don’t know how you fellas eat this
dialog: slop.
speaker_heading: PIG
dialog: You get used to it.
speaker_heading: ROVER
text: Those scraps in the piazza are looking
dialog: pretty good now. Sure wish I was back
dialog: home ...
dialog: (Sighs)
dialog: ++. with Juliet.
text: The pigs look at Rover sympathetically for a moment, then
text: return to their slop.
scene_heading: INT. BARN
text: Rover walks inside and finds the barn empty. Confused, he
text: BARKS.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Romeo? Where are ya, Romeo?
text: Rover then finds Romeo’s red feathered cap. His human friend
text: is gone.
scene_heading: INT. JULIET’S ROOM
text: Juliet curls up by the window, looking out at the falling
text: rain. She is still quite sad. Doc saunters in.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Are you planing on being miserable
dialog: forever?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I miss him, Doc. I miss him more and
dialog: more each day. And to make matters
text: worse, Juliet’s gone too. I haven’t seen
dialog: her for days.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You know how humans get when they’re in
dialog: love. They can’t think about anything
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I’m starting to understand why.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You gotta snap out of this, kid. Your
dialog: folks are real worried about you. I
dialog: heard they’re even going to ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: They're going to what, Doc?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: They're going to ask ...
text: Just then, Lord and Lady Cat-Pulet enter, followed by Vienna,
text: the snobby Viennese cat from the party.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: -.. Vienna to marry you.
text: Vienna bows before Juliet and kisses her paw.
speaker_heading: VIENNA
dialog: Juliet, how purr-fect you look!
text: Alarmed, Juliet looks at Doc.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh no ...!
scene_heading: EXT. FARM IN MANTUA - NIGHT
text: Rover lies alone in the fields and HOWLS at the moon.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: First I lose my girl, then I lose my best
dialog: friend. Could things get any worse?
text: As if one cue, it begins to rain. Rover is soaked.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: They could ...
text: He bows his head and begins to cry.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Rover looks up and finds an adorable FEMALE, GOLDEN RETRIEVER
text: PUPPY standing by the farmer’s house.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Well, to be honest ... not really.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: FEMALE PUPPY
dialog: Why don’t you come inside? The farmer
dialog: just put out some food.
text: Rover’s tempted, but not sure.
speaker_heading: FEMALE PUPPY
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Come on. I won’t bite.
text: Rover walks out of the fields and follows the cute puppy
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: INT. BELFRY
text: Flyer is experimenting with different breath sprays when
text: Juliet leaps into the the belfry.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Flyer!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You’re never going to believe what's
dialog: happened!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: My parents want me to get married with
dialog: Vienna.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Well did you try to talk them out of it?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Of course I did. But they wouldn’t hear
dialog: it. I can’t stand it how they treat me
dialog: like I’m some kind of kitten! Flyer,
dialog: what am I going to do?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I don’t know.
text: Flyer thinks for a moment. Then he shrugs his shoulders.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Well, when in doubt ...
text: Flyer flies down to the sanctuary below. Juliet leaps down
text: after him.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: When in doubt what?
dialog: 67.
text: Flyer comes across a vial, which contains a potion and sits
text: on the Friar’s lectern.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: When in doubt, do what people do.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Do what people do? What did they do?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Well, believe it or not, this same
text: situation is happening between Romeo and
dialog: Juliet.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Can you imagine? What are the chances?
dialog: And so when your Juliet came here just a
dialog: little while ago, Friar Laurence gave her
dialog: a potion like this which will make it
dialog: seem like she has died -
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Died!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Don’t be afraid. It will only seem that
dialog: she has died. Really.
text: Flyer picks up a piece of chalk and begins scrawling on a
text: piece of slate like a coach diagramming a play.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: She’1ll just be sleeping. So then she
dialog: won’t have to marry Paris. Because then
dialog: her parents will think she’s dead, see?
dialog: And who’d want to marry a dead person
dialog: anyway, right? Is this making any sense?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I’m not sure ...
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Well, let me see if I got this straight.
dialog: What’s really going to be happening is
dialog: that Juliet’s just going to be sleeping
text: The chalk figures that Flyer has drawn come to life and try
text: to act out the elaborate plan. But they become as confused
text: as Juliet is becoming.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: --. and in forty two hours she’1l wake up
dialog: good as new, and then Romeo will be there
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: CHALK FIGURES
dialog: Yeah, how?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I don’t know how! Somehow, all right?
dialog: And they’1ll go run off together and make
dialog: a new life together ... in Mantua or
dialog: somewhere. You got it?
text: The Chalk Figures shake their heads vehemently. Juliet turns
text: to Flyer tentatively.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: And you're saying this same plan would
dialog: work for me and Rover?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: That’s exactly what I’m saying.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I don’t know ...
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: What do you mean, you don’t know?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Well, it’s just it sounds so...
dialog: dangerous. And so complicated. It just
dialog: seems like there’s a lot of things that
dialog: could go wrong.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I don’t know. It just doesn’t sound wise
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: But Friar Laurence said -
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Well who cares what Friar Laurence said -
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Because he’s human, that’s why! And
dialog: everybody knows that humans are smarter
dialog: than animals. And if they’ve made this
dialog: plan ... well, it must be better than any
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: plan we could come up with. Don’t you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I guess so.
text: Neither one of them seem too convinced of the wisdom of their
text: plan, but Flyer puts the potion in front of Juliet anyway.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Now take this vial and get yourself back
dialog: to your house and do exactly as I have
dialog: said. You hear?
text: Flyer opens his wings and starts flying toward the open
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: I will fly now to Mantua to tell Rover of
dialog: our plan!
text: Juliet looks at the vial on the lectern. Finally she picks
text: it up and turns to go. The Chalk Figures shake their heads
dialog: in disapproval.
speaker_heading: CHALK FIGURES
dialog: You'll be sorry ...
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - NIGHT
text: Flyer flaps along panting rapidly. The two Doves fly nearby,
text: almost mocking how slowly the little bat struggles through
dialog: the air.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I wish I was a bird.
dialog: (Almost completely out of
dialog: breath)
dialog: I wish I was a bird.
text: Suddenly, Flyer sees something below that literally stops him
text: in mid-air.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: Oh no!
text: As Flyer zooms down to the ground, he becomes even more
text: upset.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: No! Say it isn’t so!
text: Flyer lands finally on the steps of a large marble structure
text: called “The Monument of the Lovers”. There beside him lay
text: the MOTIONLESS BODIES OF ROMEO AND JULIET THE GIRL. They
text: embrace each other gently and seem almost to be sleeping.
text: But the vial that lies beside Romeo’s outstretched hand and
text: the knife beside Juliet the Girl let Flyer know that these
dialog: lovers will never wake up again.
dialog: 70.
text: The Doves look down on the scene from above.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: Did Romeo find Juliet sleeping and think
dialog: --.? And so then he took this poison
dialog: --.? And she ... waking up to find him
dialog: dead ... did she ... take the knife and
dialog: ?
text: Flyer cries out loud.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: Oh how did this happen? How can this be?
text: Flyer covers his head with his wings and sobs. The Doves
text: look on from above. For the first time they begin to realize
text: that Flyer is more than just a scary little bat. Just as
text: they start to come closer, a terrible realization spreads
text: across Flyer’s face.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: But wait! If this happened to Romeo and
dialog: Juliet, then the same thing could happen
dialog: to ...
text: He turns and looks back toward Verona.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: I’ve got to get back to Juliet and tell
dialog: her not to take that potion!
text: Setting off toward Verona, Flyer comes over a hill and is hit
text: by sunlight. Once again his radar malfunctions and he spins
text: out of control to the ground.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, how can it get any worse than this?
text: The Doves look at one another, truly worried.
scene_heading: INT. JULIET THE GIRL’S BEDROOM
text: Juliet sits on Juliet the Girl’s bed considering Flyer’s
text: POTION. The Chalk Figures hover nearby.
speaker_heading: CHALK FIGURES
dialog: Don’t do it! You know it doesn’t make
dialog: sense -
text: But she starts to drink it anyway. As she tips the vial
text: higher, she sees herself in the mirror. Suddenly she stops
text: drinking and looks herself in the eye.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Juliet, what are you doing? Of course
text: this doesn’t make sense.
text: But the potion starts to take effect. Just as she falls
text: unconscious she sets the vials on the floor.
dialog: 71.
text: We see now, she has only drank HALF OF THE POTION.
scene_heading: EXT. NEAR THE MONUMENT OF THE LOVERS
text: Flyer is trying to do anything he can to see in the light so
text: he can fly off to Verona again. He even tries flying with a
text: seeing-eye-stick, only to come crashing down to the earth.
text: He ends up wrapped in thick vines, nearly unable to move at
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Oh, it’s no good. I’11 never be able to
dialog: see in the light!
text: Flyer’s head droops as he realizes there’s no hope.
text: But not too far away, the Doves look down, touched by Flyer’s
text: determination to help Rover and Juliet. Finally they muster
text: the courage to fly down to him. A moment later they have
text: begun to peel away the vines.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Get away
dialog: from me!
speaker_heading: DOVES
dialog: Shhh.
text: Squinting to make out who it is, Flyer begins to understand.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: What? Are you here ... to help me?
text: The Doves nod.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: Me? Scary Flyer?
text: His answer is to be lifted gently into the air. The Doves,
text: one on each of Flyer’s wing, take him higher and higher and
text: head off toward Verona.
scene_heading: INT. JULIET THE GIRL’S BEDROOM
text: Lady and Lord Cat-pulet and Doc come into the room. Doc is
text: carrying a beautiful white wedding dress. Juliet lies
text: motionless on Juliet The Girl’s pillow.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Juliet? Look, darlin’. Look what I made
dialog: of the sheets you tore up.
dialog: (Observing her more closely)
dialog: Juliet?
scene_heading: LADY CAT-PULET
dialog: Juliet, wake up!
scene_heading: LORD CAT-PULET
dialog: What’s wrong with her?
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I don’t know.
scene_heading: LADY CAT-PULET
dialog: Is she ...? Is she ...?
text: As Lady Cat-Pulet looks closer and closer at her daughter,
text: she begins to realize that something is truly wrong.
scene_heading: EXT. JULIET’S BALCONY - LATER
text: Doc lies on the stone wall, weeping. The rats, on their way
text: out of the sewer, feel her tear drops land on their tiny
text: heads. They look up.
speaker_heading: FIRST RAT
dialog: What’s with the waterworks, Doc?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (Sobbing)
dialog: My best friend is dead.
speaker_heading: RATS
dialog: Juliet?
text: Doc sobs and nods ‘yes.’
speaker_heading: FIRST RAT
dialog: That’s terrible.
speaker_heading: SECOND RAT
dialog: She was so young ...
speaker_heading: FIRST RAT
dialog: So beautiful ...
speaker_heading: SECOND RAT
dialog: And that’s saying a lot
text: coming from a couple of rats.
speaker_heading: FIRST RAT
dialog: Is there anything we can do?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You can tell all the animals. Tell them
text: Juliet will be buried in the cat-a-combs
text: at sunset.
speaker_heading: RATS
dialog: We won’t let you down, Doc!
scene_heading: INT. VILLAS - MONTAGE
text: The rats climb through holes in the walls of villas
text: throughout Verona to tell domestic animals the news.
dialog: 73.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA - MONTAGE
text: The rats scurry through the square to tell all of the city’s
dialog: stray animals the news.
scene_heading: EXT. ZOO - MONTAGE
text: The rats go from cage to cage. The elephant uses his trunk
text: to wipe the tears from his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL - END OF MONTAGE
text: The rats peer through a window in the bell tower, but Flyer
text: is gone. Instead, the rats tell the pigeons perched atop the
dialog: cathedral.
text: The pigeons, saddened, fly off.
speaker_heading: FIRST RAT
dialog: Now all of Italy will know of Juliet’s
dialog: passing ...
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE IN MANTUA - MORNING
text: As Rover tries to leave the farmer’s house, he is surrounded
text: by A LARGE FAMILY of golden retrievers.
speaker_heading: FEMALE PUPPY
dialog: My family really likes you, Rover.
text: The dogs lick and jump all over him.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: You think?
text: The Female Puppy snuggles up to Rover.
speaker_heading: FEMALE PUPPY
dialog: They think we make a great couple.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (Surprised)
dialog: A couple? All we did was share a can of
dialog: Alpo.
text: Just then, the pigs saunter by on their way to the trough.
speaker_heading: FIRST PIG
dialog: Such a pretty cat gone before her time.
speaker_heading: SECOND PIG
text: It’s rumored she died of a broken heart.
speaker_heading: FIRST PIG
dialog: Seems to be happening a lot in Verona
dialog: these days.
text: Rover's curiosity is piqued.
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Excuse me, Pigs. Who are you talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: SECOND PIG
dialog: Haven’t you heard? Juliet Cat-Pulet is
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (Shocked)
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: FIRST PIG
dialog: Did you know her ...?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Know her? She was my wife.
speaker_heading: PIGS & DOGS
dialog: Your WIFE?!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Which way back to Verona?
text: The pigs point.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Farewell, farm animals. I must see my
dialog: sweet Juliet one last time!
text: Rover runs down the dirt road. The female puppy turns to her
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: FEMALE PUPPY
dialog: Why are all the cute dogs married?
scene_heading: EXT. ABOVE FOREST OUTSIDE VERONA - AFTERNOON
text: As the Doves and Flyer approach the city walls, the Doves see
text: the Pigeons from the cathedral flying sadly back toward town.
text: They decide to fly up to them to find out what’s wrong.
scene_heading: EXT. CATACOMBS - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Rover runs up to the entrance to the catacombs, completely
text: out of breath. Because all his thoughts are on finding
text: Juliet as quickly as possible, he doesn’t notice that Shake
text: and Speare are keeping watch from across the street.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: Zounds! Forsooth, wasn’t that the
dialog: scoundrel Rover?
speaker_heading: SPEARE
dialog: Perhaps we should exeunt stage left.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: To Lord Tyger’s?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: SPEARE
dialog: Exactamundo!
text: As Rover enters the catacombs, Shake and Speare laugh
text: menacingly and head out to find Tyger.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS
text: The catacombs are a dark and somber place. The tunnels go
text: lower and lower, lit by spooky torches. Frightening
text: tombstones and artifacts fill the entire place. Rover looks
text: around, unsure which way to go.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF VERONA
text: Mercury and Benny are moping beside the river when a huge
text: mass of angry cats, led by Shake and Speare and Tyger run
text: over the bridge near them. Mercury swats Benny with his
dialog: tail.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: What do you think they’re up to?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: I don’t know. But it can’t be anything
dialog: good.
text: Mercury and Benny head after the cat, whistling to other
text: strays to come with them.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS
text: Rover is deeper in the catacombs choosing between two
text: different passageways. It’s even spookier down here. It
text: seems like a ghost could pop out at any moment.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Juliet? Oh, Juliet, where are you?
scene_heading: EXT. HILLS ABOVE CATACOMBS
text: Mercury and Benny look down at the entrance to the catacombs
text: amid a crowd of angry dogs. A second later the angry cats
text: storm in the front door. Mercury and Benny look at one
text: another confused.
scene_heading: INT. DEEP IN CATACOMBS
text: Just as Rover has reached the point of total frustration, he
text: turns a corner and sees a newly decorated tomb with the words
text: “Juliet Cat-Pulet” written above it.
scene_heading: MEANWHILE UPSTAIRS ...
text: The cats have gathered for a pep-talk.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Guys!
text: The cats stand in line, shoulder to shoulder. Tyger
text: addresses them like an all-star wrestler. He is so angry his
text: veins bulge out of his neck.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: We’re gonna crush him! Then we’re gonna
dialog: mush him! And then we’re gonna flush
dialog: him!
text: A confused cat turns to another cat.
speaker_heading: CONFUSED CAT
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: The pooch you moron!
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: The pooch!
speaker_heading: SPEARE
dialog: The pooch!
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: My kingdom for that pooch!!
text: Shake turns to Speare.
speaker_heading: SHAKE
dialog: He’s kind of getting the hang of this ...
speaker_heading: ALL THE CATS
dialog: Charge!
text: The cats scatter throughout the catacombs in a mad frenzy.
scene_heading: EXT. CATACOMBS - SUNSET
text: The Doves finally get Flyer to the front door, setting him
text: gently on the front step.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: So she’s in here?
text: The Doves nod pensively. Flyer opens the front door and
text: looks in to the spooky catacombs.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Oooh. Dark. Spooky. Reminds me of
dialog: home.
dialog: (To the Doves)
dialog: Care to join me?
text: The Doves shake their heads and high-tail it.
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: INT. JULIET’S TOMB
text: Rover solemnly approaches the tomb and finds Juliet laid out
text: on a golden pedestal. She looks lovely. Big tears come to
text: Rover’s eyes.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Oh Juliet. Look at you. There isn’t
dialog: anything I wouldn’t give just to hear you
text: purr once again.
text: He kisses Juliet lightly on the cheek. Suddenly, Juliet
text: begins to purr ever so softly. Rover looks at her completely
text: shocked.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Juliet? Is that you? Why ... why you’re
dialog: purring! Your whiskers are moving!
text: Juliet opens her eyes.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Juliet, you are alive!
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Of course I am alive.
text: They hug each other ecstatically! Then Rover looks at her
text: again, unable to believe that his dream has come true.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: But ... but ... I don’t understand ...
text: A wave of recognition spreads across Rover's face.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Maybe it’s true what they say about cats.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: That you have nine lives.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I only have one life, Rover. But I want
dialog: to spend that life with you.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Then how did you ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I couldn’t do it. I just couldn’t drink
dialog: all of that ...
text: At that very moment, Tyger’s platoon turns the corner and
text: sees Rover. Juliet, still back in her tomb, is not visible
text: to the charging cats.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: There he is!
text: As the cats near, Rover turns to Juliet.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Come on!
text: Juliet tries to get up but stumbles. Obviously, the potion
text: has not completely worn off yet.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I can’t yet. Run!
text: Rover looks at her longingly again.
speaker_heading: JULIET (cont'd)
dialog: Rover, GO!
text: Rover finally turns and sprints further down the passageway.
text: The cats are right behind him. Juliet tries to get their
dialog: attention ...
speaker_heading: JULIET (cont'd)
dialog: Tyger, guys! Stop...
text: ... but Tyger is too focused on the chase, and Juliet is too
text: weak. The pursuit leaves her behind.
text: IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
text: Flyer is soliciting help from some of his brethren who hang
text: upside down in a passageway.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Hey Lenny. How’s it hanging?
speaker_heading: LENNY
dialog: Not so bad.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: You know where Juliet’s tomb is?
text: Lenny gestures with his eyes.
speaker_heading: LENNY
dialog: Thataway.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Thanks!
text: MEANWHILE ...
text: Rover is losing ground. The snarling pack of cats nip at his
text: heals as he ducks down yet another tunnel.
dialog: 79.
scene_heading: NEAR THE TOMB
text: Flyer comes across Juliet who is now able to walk.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Juliet!
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh, Flyer, you gotta help me.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: They're trying to kill Rover!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: My family! They went down there!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Come on.
text: AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL
text: Rover comes to a dead end. He’s trapped! The cats corner
text: him against the wall. Tyger comes to the front of the pack.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Well done, henchcats!
text: Tyger practices elongating his nails as he did into the dart
dialog: board before.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Now we're going to have a little fun!
text: Rover looks at Tyger’s nails and is terrified.
text: JUST DOWN THE TUNNEL A LITTLE LATER
text: Juliet and Flyer have found Rover and the pack. They huddle
text: in the shadows and come up with a plan.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: You got it?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: You're not going to get scared?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: I’ll try.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: All right then. Let’s go.
text: At the end of the tunnel, the cats have Rover’s four limbs
text: pinned to the wall. A bulls-eye has been drawn on Rover's
text: chest. Tyger stands behind a line drawn in the dirt and
text: prepares to throw ... All of a sudden we hear a terrifying
dialog: screech!
text: All the cats turn and see Flyer, who has converted himself
text: into a HORRIFYING VAMPIRE BAT! He bares his fangs and dives
text: in on the cats. They scatter in a flash.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: I vant to suck your blood!
text: Tyger is the only cat who can keep his cool.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Guys, don’t panic. Bats don’t suck
dialog: blood. They don’t!
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: I live with ghosts. I bring the dead
dialog: back to life!
text: Flyer now points over to Juliet, who walks into the group of
text: cats like a zombie and moans like a ghost.
speaker_heading: JULIET
text: Tyyyy-gerrrr .... Tyyyy-gerrrr ...
text: This is too much for even the toughest cat. Tyger and the
text: whole crew run for their lives.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh, Flyer, you did it!
text: Flyer reverts to his adorable self.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Aw shucks ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You see how much better plans work out if
dialog: you make them yourself?
text: She frees Rover and hugs him.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I thought you said all that vampire stuff
dialog: was untrue.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Well ... so I fibbed a little. Come on,
dialog: lets get out of here.
scene_heading: AT JULIET’S TOMB
dialog: 81.
text: Tyger discovers that Juliet is not there. A suspicious look
text: comes over his face. He heads upstairs at a quicker pace.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: Rover opens a manhole and lets Juliet out. Just when the
text: lovers think they’re home free ... now the dogs are after
text: them. Mercury and Benny and their hoodlums surround Juliet.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Hey, we got ourselves a Cat-Pulet!
dialog: (To Juliet)
dialog: Don’t you know it’s not safe to be out
dialog: alone?
text: But Rover comes out of the manhole now and steps between his
dialog: friends and Juliet.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Mercury, don’t hurt her!
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: But she’s a cat!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: It doesn’t matter if she’s a cat. This
dialog: fight between our species has gone on
dialog: long enough!
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Why, you sound like ... like a cat lover!
text: Rover looks at Juliet.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Perhaps I am.
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Then in my book, you're as good as a cat.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (Hurt)
dialog: Mercury ...
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: (Turning to Mercury)
dialog: Good as a cat? What are you saying?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: I’m saying ... get them!
text: All the dogs but Benny pounce after Rover and Juliet, but the
text: young lovers make a few elusive maneuvers and dash down the
text: street. Benny trails behind the pack, almost hoping for
text: Rover and Juliet.
text: A moment later, Flyer comes out of the manhole only to
text: discover that another chase is happening.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Oh now come on! Isn’t this getting just
dialog: a little bit ridiculous?
text: But he flaps his way down the street to do what he can.
text: EXT. A FEW BLOCKS AWAY
text: Rover and Juliet are running down a narrow street, which
text: turns into a dead end. Juliet, of course, leaps to a balcony
text: and then to a roof top. Rover is left below in the street.
text: And the dogs are closing in...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Come on Rover! Jump!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I can’t! It’s too high!
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: No it’s not. Just ... just ... believe
dialog: you are a cat.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Believe I am a cat?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: That’s all you’ll need. Trust me.
text: Rover backs away from the wall to take a running start.
text: Mercury and his thugs are closing in.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Believe I ama cat. Believe I am a cat.
text: Rover starts running toward the wall.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Hurry, Rover!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Meow, meow, meow ...
text: Taking off just a few feet from the wall, Rover jumps high
text: into the air just as the dogs swipe at him and miss.
speaker_heading: ROVER
text: MEEEEEEEEOWWWWWWWW !
text: And he soars almost magically through the air, landing on the
text: rooftop next to Juliet.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You did it!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: I did?
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: You did!
text: The dogs bark below. In an instant Flyer has caught up to
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Come on you guys! We’re not out of the
dialog: woods yet.
text: In fact, the woods have gotten even thicker! Rover’s heroic
text: leap to the rooftop has caught the eye of TYGER AND HIS GOONS
text: who were heading back to the Cat-Pulet house.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF VERONA
text: Now all the cats and all the dogs are chasing Rover and
text: Juliet through town. As the commotion passes the Cat-Pulet’s
text: house and the Mongrel’s alley, Rover and Juliet’s parents
text: join the chase.
text: Pretty soon it seems like every animal in town is running
text: after Rover and Juliet. They storm through markets, houses,
dialog: gardens, restaurants, churches ... You name it! All of
text: Verona is being turned upside down.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCHED BRIDGE
text: Finally, as Rover and Juliet run out onto the bridge, the
text: CATS come up from one side and the DOGS from the other.
dialog: Rover and Juliet are trapped!
text: Flyer tries to get to them, put a dog swishes his tail,
text: knocking Flyer headfirst into the muddy riverbank.
text: A complete circle has been made around the lovers now. They
text: know they have nowhere to go. After a moment, Lady and Lord
text: Cat-Pulet and Big Daddy and Mama Mongrel come to the front.
text: They all stare at their children with disapproval.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (To his parents)
dialog: Don’t hurt her!
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: (To her parents)
dialog: Don’t hurt him!
scene_heading: LORD CAT-PULET
dialog: What’s going on here?
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: Yeah. What is going on here?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Well, the truth is ...
text: Rover turns to Lady Cat-Pulet.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Mom ...
scene_heading: LADY CAT-PULET
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: (To Lord Cat-Pulet)
dialog: Dad ...
scene_heading: LORD CAT-PULET
dialog: Dad?!
dialog: (To Juliet)
dialog: Juliet, what is the meaning of this?
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: (Folding his paws)
dialog: I'd really like to know myself.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: The truth is ...
dialog: (Gulping)
dialog: +.. we're married.
scene_heading: ALL THE PARENTS
dialog: WHAT! I!!!
text: The TWO MOTHERS instantly faint to the ground! All the dogs
text: and cats square off with one another. A fight could break
dialog: out at any second.
text: The TWO FATHERS look at one another accusingly.
scene_heading: LORD CAT-PULET
dialog: This is all your fault, Mongrel!
scene_heading: BIG DADDY MONGREL
dialog: Well maybe if you knew how to lock up
dialog: your daughter!
text: Rover and Juliet restrain their fathers.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Stop! Please!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Can’t you see that this fighting between
dialog: us dogs and cats is ridiculous?
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: All you have to do is just ...open your
dialog: eyes ...
text: Lady Cat-Pulet and Mama Mongrel, who have fallen side by
text: side, regain consciousness and look one another in the eye
speaker_heading: JULIET (cont'd)
dialog: ++. and look at each other ...
dialog: 85.
text: Lord Cat-Pulet and Big Daddy Mongrel turn and look at one
text: another too. In fact, every dog on the bridge turns and
text: looks at the cat he or she was about to fight with.
speaker_heading: JULIET (cont'd)
dialog: ++. you would see ...
text: The tension on the bridge begins to ease. All the dogs and
text: cats reach out to one another, much like a person looking at
text: himself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: JULIET (cont'd)
dialog: We're really very much alike.
text: Doc and Benny gaze at one another. So do the mothers ...
speaker_heading: JULIET (cont'd)
dialog: Much more alike than we are different ...
text: Unfortunately, Tyger and Mercury aren’t so enchanted by the
text: sudden inter-species love-fest. They look at one another
text: distrustfully. As their paws come out to touch ...
text: Tyger elongates his nails right into Mercury's eyes!
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Bulls-eye!
text: Mercury reels back in pain. A dark look of fury spreads
text: across his face ...
speaker_heading: TYGER (cont'd)
dialog: Or should I say, “Dogs-eye”?
text: Benny sees that Mercury’s getting COMPLETELY STEAMED.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Mercury, no!
text: But it’s too late. Mercury jumps on Tyger, starting a full
text: out brawl! Dogs and cats are jumping in from everywhere now.
text: Rover and Juliet try to get things calmed down again ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Guys, stop!
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Don’t, please!
text: But it’s no use. SCREECHES and GROWLS are heard coming from
text: every direction. Dog and cat limbs emerge from a growing
text: puff of smoke.
text: Juliet ends up getting knocked down and nearly trampled.
text: Rover runs to her.
speaker_heading: ROVER (cont'd)
dialog: Juliet!
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Oh, Rover.
text: They look around themselves. Their worst nightmare has come
text: to pass. They hold each other, on the verge of tears.
text: Flyer meanwhile, has finally extracted himself from the mud.
text: He flies up to the bridge a completely unrecognizable blob.
text: Looking down on the battle below, Flyer summons an almost
text: supernatural strength, and bellows out an enormous yell.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: STOP!!
text: All the animals turn and look. When Flyer finally shakes the
text: mud off himself and the animals see that he is a bat, they
text: recoil in shocked fear.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: No! Don’t be afraid of me. Listen to
dialog: me.
text: But they don’t seem to want to listen. A few animals bolt
text: into the woods.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: I’m not scary. I’m not...
text: Suddenly from above, we hear a loud whistle. A second later
text: the two Doves flutter down and put their wings around Flyer,
text: just as he had tried to put his wings around them earlier.
text: The other animals of Verona take this as a sign and begin to
text: grow less frightened of Flyer.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: We shouldn’t be so distrustful of each
dialog: other. We shouldn’t be afraid of each
dialog: other for no reason. Dogs ... cats ...
dialog: any of us. You see what can happen?
text: Flyer turns and points toward town.
text: Romeo and Juliet’s funeral procession is making its way
text: through the streets of Verona.
dialog: 
text: All the Montagues and Capulets march behind a veiled hearse.
text: As the procession makes its way across the bridge, the
text: animals part somberly and let it pass.
speaker_heading: FLYER (cont'd)
dialog: Is that what we want to happen to us,
dialog: too?
text: Lord Cat-pulet and Big Daddy Mongrel look at one another for
text: a moment. Then they turn and begin following the procession.
text: All the other animals of Verona trail behind them as well.
scene_heading: EXT. HILL OVERLOOKING VERONA
text: The funeral procession comes to a halt at the top of the
text: hill. The entire city of Verona can be seen below.
dialog: 87.
text: As the cats and dogs follow Flyer, the procession of mourners
text: begins to part to each side, allowing Rover and Juliet to see
text: for the first time THE GRAVES OF ROMEO AND JULIET. Two
text: tombstones bear the lovers’ names.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Romeo ...
speaker_heading: JULIET
dialog: Juliet ...
text: The Capulets and The Montagues lay red roses on each grave.
text: The families turn and look at one another.
speaker_heading: LORD CAPULET
dialog: O brother Montague, give me thy hand ...
text: Lord Montague and Lord Capulet take each other’s hand, while
text: their wives weep in each other’s arms. The Prince addresses
dialog: both families.
speaker_heading: PRINCE
dialog: Never was a story of more woe, than that
dialog: of Juliet and her Romeo ...
text: The Prince and The Friar lead the two families back down the
text: hill. Once enemies, The Capulets and The Montagues are now
text: joined in their sorrow.
text: When the humans are gone, the dogs and cats approach the
text: graves, encircling Rover and Juliet. Flyer hovers above the
dialog: couple.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Cat-Pulets, Mongrels. Don’t make the
dialog: same mistakes that the families of Romeo
dialog: and Juliet made.
text: Flyer hovers between the cats and dogs.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: This war between cats and dogs, what good
dialog: is it? Can anyone even remember how it
dialog: began?
text: The cats and dogs scratch their heads.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: The time for peace has come. You’re one
text: family now. Brought together by the love
dialog: of Rover for Juliet, and Juliet for
dialog: Rover. What possibly could be
dialog: a better reason to forget your
dialog: differences than that?
text: Flyer nudges Rover with his wing.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Rover ...
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: Go make nice with your in-laws.
text: Rover walks over to Lord Cat-Pulet.
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Lord Cat-Pulet, I love your daughter very
dialog: much and promise to always be good to
dialog: her.
text: Lord Cat-Pulet looks at his wife, then back at Rover.
scene_heading: LORD CAT-PULET
dialog: I never thought I’d be saying this toa
dialog: mongrel, but ... Welcome to the family,
dialog: son!
text: Lord Cat-Pulet and Rover embrace. The cats meow and the dogs
text: bark with joy.
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY
dialog: (To Juliet)
dialog: Come give your big daddy a hug!
text: Juliet gets a giant hug from Big Daddy. Everyone is happy,
text: except for Tyger and Mercury. Flyer notices this and nudges
dialog: them together.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Boys, don’t you have something you can
dialog: say to each other? I mean you are
dialog: brothers now.
text: Tyger and Mercury try to think of something.
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Like milk?
speaker_heading: MERCURY
dialog: Gives me gas. Bones?
speaker_heading: TYGER
dialog: Not a chance.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Well, this may take a while ...
text: Big Daddy and Lord Cat-Pulet have their paws around each
text: other’s shoulders.
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY
dialog: Come. Let’s return to Verona. Together .
text: The cats and dogs begin to walk down the hill. Then Big
text: Daddy turns around and looks up at Flyer.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: BIG DADDY
dialog: Aren't you coming, Flyer? If it weren’t
dialog: for you, none of this would be possible
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Hey, that’s true!
text: Everyone looks up and agrees.
speaker_heading: JULIET
text: Three cheers for Flyer!
text: Everyone CHEERS. Flyer turns bright red.
speaker_heading: FLYER
dialog: Come on now ... you’re making
dialog: me blush!
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA
text: People are shocked as they watch the dogs and cats walk side
text: by side through the city together. Rover and Juliet turn to
text: one another and smile. Flyer is above them, filled with joy.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.O.)
dialog: Well I guess we’re one up on ol’ William
dialog: S. At least our story has a happy
text: ending. And not just for the Cat-Pulets
dialog: and The Mongrels ...

dialog: helped to make the lost of their daughter
text: a little less painful.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA - MONTAGE
text: Lord Montague sees the Butcher yelling at Rover. He walks
text: over, pays the Butcher for his steaks, and takes Rover in his

text: Rover waits until the servant has gone, then lets the rest of
text: his family in through the doggy door.
speaker_heading: FLYER (V.O.) (cont'd)
