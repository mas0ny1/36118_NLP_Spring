scene_heading: EXT. MARATHON, FLORIDA, BEACH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY
text: The highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men
text: imposed in front of it. The beach is white sand. JACK
text: CRAWFORD -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington.
text: His suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white
dialog: sleeves says City, not Florida Keys. WILL GRAHAM -- late
text: thirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio-
text: let shorts, belongs. Graham smokes. Crawford drinks from
text: a glass of iced tea. Then:
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I should have caught you at the boat
dialog: yard when you got off work. You
dialog: don't want to talk about it here...
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I don't want to talk about it
dialog: anywhere.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If you brought pictures, leave them
text: in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin
dialog: will be back soon.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: How much do you know?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What was in the 'Miami Herald' and
dialog: the 'Times.'
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Confessions?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
text: Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He
text: smashes the mirrors and uses the
dialog: pieces.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: None of them knew that;
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What else did you keep out of the
dialog: papers?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Blond, right-handed, really strong,
text: wears a size eleven shoe. The prints
text: are all smooth gloves. He's on a
dialog: full moon cycle. Both times. His
dialog: blood is AB Positive.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Somebody hurt him?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
text: Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
text: Crawford takes a sip of the iced tea and looks at Graham.
dialog: 2.
text: Graham flips his cigarette into the surf.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Will... you saw this in the papers.
text: The second one was all over TV. Did
dialog: you ever think about givin' me a
dialog: call?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: The Bureau already has the best lab.
dialog: Plus you have Bloom at the University
dialog: of Chicago...
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: And I got you down here fixing fuckin'
dialog: boat motors.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You don't need me. I wouldn't
dialog: be useful to you anymore, Jack.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Last two like this we had, you
dialog: caught.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That was three years ago. And by
dialog: doing the same things you and the
text: rest of them at the lab are doing.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: That's not entirely true, Will.
dialog: It's the way you think.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I think there has been a lot of
dialog: bullshit about the way I think.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I came down here to get away from
dialog: all that.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You look all right now.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I am all right.
text: Crawford pulls two pictures from his shirt pocket. He keeps
text: them face down. They draw at Will. Crawford knows this.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: If you can't look anymore, I
dialog: understand...
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: As long as they're dead...
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: These are all dead, Will.
speaker_heading: PICTURES
dialog: If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two
text: snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck
text: carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family
text: behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling.
speaker_heading: CLOSE: GRAHAM
text: looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds. Then he
text: puts them down and looks along the beach.
scene_heading: GRAHAM'S POV: MOLLY + KEVIN
text: KEVIN -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the
text: water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand.
text: MOLLY -- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands
text: watching the two men, her hand on her hip. Waves careen
text: around her ankles. Her body language openly states
text: hostility. It's towards Crawford.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM (O.S.)
dialog: Let's talk after dinner. Stay and
dialog: eat.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD (O.S.)
dialog: I'LL come back later. I got messages
dialog: at the Holiday Inn to collect
text: Molly starts walking forward. On it...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GRAHAM'S KITCHEN - MOLLY + GRAHAM - NIGHT
text: are doing dishes. Graham wipes while Molly washes.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: He stopped by to see me at the shop
dialog: before he came out here.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What did he want?
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: He asked how you are.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: And you said?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I said you are fine, he should leave
dialog: you the hell alone.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'm a forensic specialist, Molly.
dialog: You've seen my diploma?
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: I got a diploma and everything.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You mended a crack in the wallpaper
dialog: with your diploma.
dialog: (heat)
dialog: You are open and easy now... It took
dialog: you a lot of work to get to that...
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: We have it good, don't we?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: All the things that happened to you
dialog: before make you know that...
text: There is a soft pleading in her voice.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What the hell can I do?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: What you've already decided. You're
dialog: not really asking.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: If I were?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (facing him)
dialog: Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.
dialog: And Kevin.
dialog: (heat)
dialog: That's selfish, huh?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (touches the side
dialog: of her face)
dialog: I don't care.
dialog: (beat&gt;
dialog: He'll never see me or know my name.
dialog: If we find him, the police will have
dialog: to take him down. Not me, I'm just
text: looking at evidence.
dialog: 5.
text: As he puts an arm around Molly...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - KEVIN - TWILIGHT
text: is working in the sand. Behind him Graham is stapling
text: chicken wire to two foot-high fence posts.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Will it keep them out?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yeah. ..
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: How many turtle eggs you think are
dialog: in here?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Crabs would get most of the newborns
dialog: before they made it to the sea, huh?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yeah, but not now.. These will all
dialog: make it... guaranteed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - CRAWFORD + MOLLY - NIGHT
text: On the porch swing. Beyond them at the water's edge Graham
text: nothing to each other the fence. Crawford and Molly say
dialog: or a while. Then, finally:
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Whatever I say, you'll take him
dialog: away, won't you?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I have to.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You're his friend, Jack. Why can't
dialog: you leave him alone?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Because it's his bad luck to be
dialog: special.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: He thinks you want him to look at
dialog: evidence.
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Nobody's better with evidence. But
dialog: he has the other thing, too. He
dialog: doesn't like that part of it...
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You wouldn't like it, either if you
dialog: had it.
text: There is a pause between them. Molly lights a cigarette.
text: Crawford leans forward, resting his thick, pale, forearms
text: on his knees.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Talking about 'like,' you don't like
dialog: me very much, do you?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't like people who park in the
dialog: 'handicapped zone'...
speaker_heading: CRAWFROD
dialog: I'LL try to keep him as far away from
dialog: it as I can...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ATLANTA STREET - WIDE - NIGHT
text: Small poplars line the curb. It rained. The sidewalks are
text: wet. They are drying in splotches. The street is deserted.
text: The front walk vertically bisects the FRAME. An Atlanta
text: Police department car pulls to the curb and stops. The door
text: opens, lighting the interior and Will Graham starts out the
dialog: passenger side.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (distant)
dialog: Thanks for the lift.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: I'll come inside with you, if you
dialog: like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd
dialog: probably want to be alone.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: OFFTCER
dialog: There's a VTR setup waiting in your
dialog: hotel room, that you asked for
dialog: They transferred the home movies of
dialog: both families once half-inch VHS.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (getting out)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Graham exits the car and walks TOWARDS us. We PAN AROUND as
text: he moves through EXTREME CLOSEUP and see the Leeds family house
text: with all of the Atlanta Police department "crime scene" postings
text: Graham doesn't enter the front door. Be walks around the side.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LEEDS HOUSE, KITCHEN - WIDE - NIGHT
text: Three big sliding glass doors. The center one has been re-
text: placed with plywood. It's dark. A flashlight's beam starts
text: playing through the bushes in the side yard.., then the light
text: appears and blasts IN the LENS. It lights lots of dishes in
text: the sink. The dark kitchen looks like anybody's kitchen. The
text: house feels occupied. The Leed's possessions have been
text: undisturbed.
speaker_heading: CLOSE: GLASS DOOR
text: We hear the lock click and the door slide open as Graham
text: enters. It's like he's a burglar.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM'S FEET
text: walk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going.
text: A thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly.
text: Graham's feet pass our of frame...
scene_heading: INT. LEEDS HOUSE, SECOND STORY - FLOOR
text: is empty. The carpet is dark. We hear Graham's footsteps
text: up the stairs. Then his feet enter the frame and a flash-
text: light beam hits the carpet. It dwells on a couple of dark
text: stains. Track with Graham's feet to the entry to the master
text: bedroom. The bedroom is dark. We see nothing.
scene_heading: INT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM - LIGHT SWITCH
text: Graham's hand enters. He hits the light switch.
speaker_heading: BLOOD
text: screams at us from the walls.
speaker_heading: CLOSE: GRAHAM
text: doesn't visibly react.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: WIDER - GRAHAM
text: moves into the room. The bloodstains are extensive. Half
text: the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock. The
text: mirrors are smashed. Taped outlines on the mattress indi-
text: cate where the bodies had been found. Graham opens the
text: file he carries containing autopsy, lab and crime reports.
scene_heading: OVERHEAD ANGLE - GRAHAM
text: standing alone in the middle of the master bedroom. The
text: crime scene -- the disarray, the big splashes of arterial
text: blood on the walls, the smashed mirrors, taped outlines or
text: bodies -- is a testament to a violence that is pornographic.
text: Graham pulls out a tape recorder and starts dictating his
text: own notes, thumbing through various reports for reference.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: intruder entered through kitchen
text: sliding door. Probably a glass
dialog: cutter. Why didn't he care that he
dialog: left AB saliva on the glass? it was
dialog: hot out that night. inside, the
dialog: house must' have been pleasantly cool
dialog: to him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The intruder cut Charles Leeds'
text: throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs.
text: Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was
text: rising... Bullet entered the right of
text: her navel and lodged in her lumbar
text: spine, but she died of strangulation...
dialog: increase of serotonin and free
text: histimine levels in the gunshot wound
dialog: indicates... she lived at least five
dialog: minutes after she was shot... All
text: her other injuries were post-mortem.
dialog: (beat&gt;
text: Then he went toward the children's
dialog: room.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Direction and velocity of blood
text: stains on the east wall indicate
dialog: arterial spray.;. With his throat
text: cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight.
dialog: Because the intruder was moving to
dialog: the children's room...
dialog: (beat)
text: in the children's room the intruder
text: shot the first boy in bed. Second
dialog: boy was found in bed, but dustballs
dialog: indicate he was dragged out from
text: under his bed to be shot...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
text: Profusion of bloodstains and matted
text: sliding marks on hall carpet and
text: west wall of master bedroom remain
text: unexplained... as does superficial
text: ligature mark around Mr. Leed's
text: chest, believed to be post-mortem.
dialog: What did the killer do with them
dialog: after they were dead? And before
dialog: he put the boys back in their beds?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ZNT. LEEDS BATHROOM - MEDICINE CABINET - NIGHT
text: is dark. We see nothing. Light comes on. Graham enters.
text: He rests his hands on the sides of the sink. He turns on
text: the water. He pops two pills, cups his hands under the
text: faucet and drinks. He looks at himself in the mirror. Be
text: is breathing normally. Over his shoulder he sees...
scene_heading: ZOOM INTO: MRS. LEEDS' PANTYHOSE
text: still hanging on a towel railing over the bathtub. Graham
text: is staring at the normal domesticity of a family bathroom.
text: He doesn't let it unnerve him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LEEDS' HOUSE; PORCH ROOF - WIDE - NIGHT
text: The window opens and Graham climbs onto the porch roof and
text: sits on the gritty shingles. We're looking for a distressed
text: reaction. There is none. Graham is clamped down. Beyond
text: him, the lights of Atlanta and the stars are brilliant...
dialog: More brilliant than they ought to be. The Delta Aquirid
text: meteor shower's at its maximum This is not a normal image.
text: He takes out his tape recorder again.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: There's a wicker dog bed on the back
text: porch. There's a doghouse in the
dialog: back yard. Where's the dog?
text: HOLD ON Graham.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ATLANTA HYATT HOUSE, ELEVATOR - WIDE - NIGHT
text: Graham riding up with two half-drunk CONVENTIONEERS with big
text: "Hi" badges. One Conventioneer is looking over at the lobby

dialog: 10.
text: A good-looking woman in a floral dress walks underneath them.
text: Graham is leaning against the glass.
speaker_heading: CONVENTIONEER #1
dialog: ...like to rip me off a piece of
dialog: that!
speaker_heading: CONVENTIONEER #2
dialog: Fuck her 'til her nose bleeds.
text: The other cracks up.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: snaps alert and stares at Conventioneer #2.
speaker_heading: CONVENTIONEER #2
text: sips his gin and tonic, senses Graham's stare. He smiles:
speaker_heading: CONVENTIONEER #1
dialog: What the fuck are you lookin' at?
text: Graham looks away. The elevator stops. The door opens.
dialog: Conventioneer #1 drags Conventioneer #2.
speaker_heading: CONVENTIONEER #l
dialog: (being pulled out
dialog: of elevator)
dialog: What are you, a faggot?
text: Both Conventioneers laugh as they walk down the hall.
text: Conventioneer #1 wiggles his fat hips and apes a limp wrist
text: Graham looks away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ZNT. HOLIDAY ZNN ROOM - VTR MONITOR: LEEDS FAMILY - NIGHT
text: We are seeing a videotape transfer of the Leeds family home
text: movie. Mr. Leeds and Mrs. Leeds are behind the table while
text: the youngest boy is in the center. His brother sits next
text: to him. The birthday cake has eleven candles on it. All
dialog: are mouthing silently: "Happy Birthday to you, happy birth-
dialog: day to you..." Mrs. Leeds has her arms crossed underneath
text: her breasts. She's a young mother, sensual and warm. She's
text: smiling. The camera must be on a tripod because Mr. Leeds
text: runs into the frame tousles his son's hair and kisses his
text: wife's cheek. He has thinning hair. He's a big man. He
text: looks like a nice guy. He darts out of the frame back to
text: the camera. They finish singing. The youngest Leeds boy
text: blows out the candles. Mr. Leeds holds up for the camera
text: a large yellow envelope that says: "Follow the ribbon." A
text: big yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope.
dialog: 11.
text: The camera pans right as the youngest Leeds boy starts to
text: follow the ribbon... The image suddenly ours out. Video noise.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: has hit the stop button. He picks up a measured field sketch
text: of the master bedroom. The bloodstains are represented in
text: outline. Three are along the left wall. The arterial
text: splashes from Mr. Leeds are on the right wall. Mr. and Mrs.
text: Leeds' body positions are indicated on the king-size mat-
dialog: tress.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (into the tape
dialog: recorder)
dialog: When they were dead -- except
dialog: possibly Mrs. Leeds -- he smashed
dialog: the mirrors and began selecting
dialog: shards that he used later on Mrs.
dialog: Leeds... What did he do in the
dialog: interval? Struggling with Mr.
dialog: Leeds and killing the others would
dialog: take less than a minute. What
dialog: else?
dialog: (beat)
text: Three bloodstains on the east wall,
text: not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray.
dialog: What did killer do after they were
dialog: dead?
text: Graham can't go any further. He is frustrated. He picks
text: up the phone and dials. He waits. Then:
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Molly?
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: (asleep)
dialog: Huh?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Will? Is that you?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's me. I'll call you tomorrow,
dialog: sweetheart. Go back to sleep.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I love you...
speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will.
dialog: Good night.
text: Will hangs up the phone. He reaches over and punches "Play"
text: on the VTR.
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT: THE ROOM - GRAHAM
text: VTR backs up, starts to play and we see the image of Mrs.
text: Leeds again in the home movie: they follow the yellow rib-
text: bon down the stairs to a bicycle. It's indoors. It's rain-
text: ing outside. The eleven-year-old Leeds boy is ecstatic.
text: Mrs. Leeds smiles.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (into tape recorder)
dialog: You moved the kids after you killed
dialog: them, didn't you? Did you arrange
dialog: them for your performance with Mrs.
dialog: Leeds on their bed? Did you tie Mr.
dialog: Leeds sitting up in bed? That's the
text: postmortem ligature on his chest.
dialog: Did you make them your audience?
dialog: Did you open their eyes? There is
dialog: something you can't afford for me
dialog: to know about. Isn't there? Mrs.
dialog: Leeds was lovely, wasn't she? It was
dialog: maddening to have to wear gloves when
dialog: you touched her, wasn't it?
dialog: (beat)
text: There was talcum powder on her leg.
dialog: There was no talcum powder in the
dialog: bathroom.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The powder they found came out of a
dialog: rubber glove as you pulled it off
dialog: to touch her. You took off your
dialog: glove to touch her. DIDN'T YOU,
dialog: YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH?! You touched
dialog: her with your bare hands! And then
dialog: you put the gloves back an. And
dialog: you wiped her down! While your
dialog: gloves were off?
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: DID YOU OPEN THEIR EYES? THEIR DEAD
dialog: EYES?!
scene_heading: FAST MOVEMENTS: GRAHAM'S HAND
text: snakes out and hits the "Stop" button on the VTR.
speaker_heading: PHONE
text: is picked up and we MOVE WITH IT to his face. Graham punches

text: He is cold, calm.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still
dialog: in Latent Prints?
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD (V.O.)
dialog: He's working on the single print
dialog: index. What time is it?
dialog: Get him to Atlanta.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD (V.O.)
dialog: You said the guy down here is good.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD (V.O.)
dialog: What do you want to do?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails.
dialog: I think he took off his gloves, Jack.
dialog: (heat)
dialog: And dust all the corneas of all their
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ATLANTA DETECTIVE BUREAU - MOVING WITH GRAHAM, CRAWFORD
scene_heading: + SPRINGFIELD -DAY
text: down the corridor.
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: Our people swear he wore surgeons'
dialog: gloves the whole time. They dusted
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: The report didn't mention nails and
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: Why do you think he took his gloves
dialog: off?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman.
dialog: I'd want to touch her skin in an
dialog: intimate situation, wouldn't you?
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: (sudden distaste)
dialog: 'Intimate? !"
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Everybody else was dead.
dialog: 14.
text: Springfield looks at Graham. Springfield needs answers, not
text: voodoo. Then they enter the squad room. Twenty detectives
text: sit at desks. Graham and Crawford move to the back of the
dialog: class.
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: All right. House to house interviews
dialog: will be extended four additional
dialog: blocks. R &amp; I has loaned us two

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Dr. Princi.
scene_heading: DR. DOMINIQUE PRINCI, Chief Medical Examiner for Fulton
text: County, walks to the front and stands under a drawing of
text: teeth. He hold's up a dental cast.
speaker_heading: DR. PRINCI
dialog: This is what the subject's teeth
dialog: look like. The Smithsonian in
dialog: Washington reconstructed them from
dialog: the impressions we took of bite
dialog: marks off the Leeds woman here and
dialog: off the Jacobi woman last month in
dialog: Birmingham.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As you can see, he has pegged lateral
dialog: incisors -- the teeth here and here.
text: The teeth look like teeth from a small bear.
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: Investigator Graham has worked this
dialog: kind of thing before. Can you add
dialog: anything?
text: Graham doesn't like talking in public. He stutters and
text: starts to say something...
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: Can't hear you. Can you come up to
dialog: the front?
text: Graham walks to the front of the room.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: He may have a history of biting --
dialog: barroom fights or child abuse.
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: He only bit women so far, right?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That's all we know about.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Most of the time in sex assaults the
text: bite mark has a livid spot in the
dialog: center. A suck mark. These don't.
dialog: So, for him, biting may be a fighting
dialog: pattern as much as sexual behavior.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You could try emergency room
dialog: personnel, treatment for bite wounds.
dialog: I know that's pretty thin...
dialog: (beat)
text: He bites a lot.
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: What's average?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM

text: Graham sits down.
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: All right. Vice and Narcotics, take

text: They start to rise. Springfield remembers.
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: One more thing: I've heard officers
dialog: referring to the killer as the 'Tooth
dialog: Fairy.
dialog: (on laughter)
dialog: Yeah, yeah, but I don't want to hear
dialog: that in public or internal memoranda.
dialog: That's it.

speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: What did the psychologists say was

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Psychologists call him a sociopath.
dialog: They don't know what else to call
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD
dialog: What would you call him?
text: Graham doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: CRAWFORD

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: CRAWIIORD
dialog: Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and

speaker_heading: JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)
dialog: I got a partial with a tented arch
dialog: that's probably a thumb print and
text: a fragment of a palm.
text: Springfield reacts.
speaker_heading: JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)
text: Came off the oldest kid's left eye.
text: It stood out against an eight-ball
text: hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Can you make an identification off
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)
dialog: Don't know. The palm came off the

text: Hangs up.

speaker_heading: SPRINGFIELD

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: LOUNDS

dialog: When did they call you in, Will?
dialog: What have you got?
text: Graham won't answer him. They are on the sidewalk by now.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Lounds, give it a rest...
speaker_heading: LOUNDS
dialog: Come on, Graham?! Talk to me!
text: Graham and Crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now. Crawford
text: tries to block Lounds. Lounds moves around him, dogging Graham:
speaker_heading: LOUNDS
dialog: How does this guy compare with
dialog: Lecter? How does he do them?
text: Right now he makes the mistake of grabbing Graham's arm to

dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: Grabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: GRAHAM.

dialog: (pause)
dialog: We'll get him one way or the other.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: What's one way?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: We find an event that connects both

dialog: male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If we find out how he found them,
dialog: then we'll find him.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: We're running it through the

speaker_heading: GRAHAM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: MOLLY (V.O.)

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: TWO SHOT
text: Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair. He appears

speaker_heading: DR. CHILTON
text: Dr. Lecter will stay in his room.
dialog: That is absolutely the only place
text: where he is not put in full body

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I might have to show him some

speaker_heading: DR. CHILTON
dialog: As long as it's on soft paper.

speaker_heading: DR. CHILTON
text: Here Lecter's resting on the

dialog: electrocardiogram. Complained of

text: Here he grabs the nurse's head and
text: pulls her down to him. Here he's
text: subdued by the attendant and
text: Lecter's shoulder is dislocated.
dialog: Do you notice the strange thing?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: His pulse never got over eighty-
text: five. Even when he tore into her
dialog: face.
text: Dr. Chilton looks over at Graham, perhaps expecting a.
text: response. There is nothing to read in Graham's face. It is
text: a blank.
speaker_heading: DR. CHILTON
dialog: The consensus around here is that
dialog: the only person who has demonstrated
dialog: any practical understanding of Dr.
dialog: Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr. Graham.
dialog: Can you tell me anything about him?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No.
dialog: 25 .
speaker_heading: DR. CHILTON
dialog: When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders,
dialog: their 'style,' so to speak, were you
dialog: able to reconstruct his fantasies?
dialog: And did that help you identify him?
speaker_heading: DR. CHILTON
text: looks at Graham. Dr. Chilton has seen a lot of hostility.
text: Right now he's seeing some more.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (stands)

speaker_heading: DR. CHILTON
dialog: Uh... sure...
scene_heading: INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY SECTION - DOOR - DAY
text: We hear three locks opening. The door opens. Graham enters.
text: An attendant behind Graham closes the door and we hear the

dialog: chair. We haven't yet seen what Graham looks at. Now:
scene_heading: GRAHAM'S POV: BARRED CELL
text: A 6x10 cage. In the center of the bars separating Graham

text: cell -- laying on his bunk -- is DR. HANNIBAL LECKTOR. He
text: appears to be asleep. His back is to Graham. He has not
dialog: stirred. Then:
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: That's the same atrocious aftershave
dialog: you wore in court three years ago.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I keep getting it for Christmas.
scene_heading: CLOSE: LECKTOR'S HEAD
text: turns to us. His small eyes drill into Graham's brain.
text: Lecktor's attitude is professionally psychiatric, as if Graham
dialog: is the patient.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Did you get my card?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I got it. Thank you.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM' S

speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: And how is Officer Stuart? The one
dialog: who was the first to see my basement.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Stuart is fine.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Emotional problems, I hear. He was
dialog: a very promising young officer. Do
dialog: you ever have any problems, Will?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Of course, you don't.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm glad you came. My callers are
dialog: all professional. Clinical
dialog: psychiatrists from cornfield colleges
dialog: somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Dr. Bloom showed me your article on
dialog: surgical addiction in the journal
dialog: of Clinical Psychiatry.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Very interesting, even to a layman.
text: Lecktor rolls around and examines the term "layman" in his
dialog: head. Then:
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: A layman.., layman. Interesting
dialog: term. So many experts on government
dialog: grants. And you say you're a
dialog: 'layman?' But it was you who caught
dialog: me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know
dialog: how you did it'
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You've read the transcript. It's
dialog: all there.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: No it's not. Do you know how you
dialog: Did it Will?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's in the transcript. What does
dialog: it matter now?
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It doesn't matter to me, Will.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Yes, I thought so.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Yes .
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You read about it, I'm sure.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: In the papers. I don't rear out the
dialog: articles.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I wouldn't want them to think I was
dialog: dwelling on anything morbid. You
dialog: want to know how he's choosing them,
dialog: don't you?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I thought you would have some ideas.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Why should I tell you?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: There are things you don't have.
dialog: Research materials... I could speak
dialog: to the Chief of Staff...?
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He
dialog: fumbles at your head like a freshman
text: pulling at a panty girdle.
dialog: (laugh;)
dialog: He actually tries to give me a
dialog: Thematic and Apperception test.
dialog: Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to
text: come up. It's a card with a woman
text: in bed and a man in the foreground.
dialog: I was supposed to avoid a sexual

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Never mind, it's boring.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You'll get to see the file on this
dialog: case. And there's another reason.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Pray tell.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I thought you might be curious to
dialog: find our if you're smarter than
dialog: the person I'm looking for.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Then by implication, you think that
dialog: you are smarter than me, since you
dialog: caught me.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No. I knew that I'm nor smarter
dialog: than you are.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Then how did you catch me, Will?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You had disadvantages.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: What disadvantage?.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You're insane.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: You're very tan, Will.
dialog: Graham does not answer, If anything happens, there is a
text: tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to
dialog: Lecktor.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Your hands are rough. They don't
dialog: look like a cop s hands anymore.
dialog: That shaving lotion is something a
dialog: child would select. It has a ship
dialog: on the bottle, doesn't it?
text: Another silence. Lecktor's eyes look as if they're drilling
text: into Graham's head, trying to find out things. Trying to
dialog: find a way to hurt Graham. He's very threatening. Then
dialog: relaxes:
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Don't think you can persuade me with
dialog: appeals to my intellectual vanity.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I don't think I'll persuade you.
dialog: You'll do it or you won't. Dr.
dialog: Bloom is working an it anyway, and
dialog: he's the best...
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Do you have the file with you
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Pictures?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: LECKTOR

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR

dialog: my books yet.
text: Graham gets up and starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: let me have the file. Then I'll
dialog: tell you what I think.
text: Graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant.
text: Then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding
text: tray. Lecktor pulls it through.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take
text: one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees:

scene_heading: GRAHAM'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE PAN THROUGH CELL OP
speaker_heading: DR. LECKTOR
dialog: Toothbrush, mirror, sink, Sryrofoam cups, soft paper jour-
text: nals, T-shirts, neatly stacked hospital pads, sneakers with-
dialog: no shoelaces, the wall, seatless toilet bowl, etc, etc
text: All the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light.
text: Their edges are sharper and more defined than normal. The
text: shadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes. It is a high
text: resolution, highly brilliant sec of images. It feels like a
text: hyper-perception of reality, a super-realism perceived by the
text: mind of Graham. It is interrupted when:
speaker_heading: LECKTOR (O.S.)
text: There is a very shy boy, Will.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: snaps back to the present, looks at Lecktor.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: What were the yards like?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: Big backyards, fences, some hedges,
dialog: why?
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Because, my dear Will, if this
text: Pilgrim imagines he has a
dialog: relationship with the full moon,
dialog: he might go outside and look at it.
dialog: Have you seen blood in moonlight,
dialog: Will? It appears quite black. If
dialog: one were nude, it would be better
dialog: to have outdoor privacy for this
dialog: sort of thing.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That's interesting.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: It's not 'interesting'. You thought
dialog: of it before.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes. I'd considered it.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: You came here to look at me, Will.
dialog: To get the old scent again, didn't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I want your opinion.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: I don't have one right now.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: When you do have one I'd like to
dialog: hear it.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: May I keep the file?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I haven't decided yet.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: I'll study it, Will. When you get
dialog: more files, I'd like to see them,
dialog: too. You can call me. When I
dialog: have to call my lawyer, they bring
dialog: me a telephone. Would you like to
dialog: give me your home number?
dialog: Threat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Do you know how you caught me,
dialog: Will?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can
dialog: leave messages for me at the number
text: on the file.
text: Graham bangs on the door. Locks are starting to be unlocked.
dialog: Graham can't wait to get out of here. He wants the locks to
dialog: get unlocked faster!
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: Do you know how you caught me?
text: The door is now open. Graham fights down the impulse to run
text: through. As Graham -- controlled -- steps out, what he hears
dialog: is :
speaker_heading: LECKTOR (O.S.)
dialog: The reason you caught me, Will, is:
dialog: we're just alike. You want the

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: You went in the apartment?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes. Hobbs had one of his

dialog: cutting her. I shot him.
dialog: We get the feeling Graham is leaving out lots of pieces and
text: gives Kevin only the bare bones of what he needs to know.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I kept thinking there must be some
dialog: way I could have handled it better.
dialog: It kept replaying in my mind.
dialog: Later I got depressed. A doctor
dialog: friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked
dialog: me to go into a hospital. After a

dialog: and was okay.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Did the girl die?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: KEVIN

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: KEVIN

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

dialog: Killing somebody feels that bad?
scene_heading: EXTREMELY CLOSE: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Kevin: it's the ugliest thing in

text: Kevin thinks about this for a long time. He nods. He feels

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: What kind of coffee do you like?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: KEVIN

scene_heading: FRONTAL: MOLLY + GRAHAM.
text: The grass looks cold in the moonlight. Holly wears a heavy

text: Behind them -- with yellow lights -- the house looks like

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: It's hard to have anything, isn't it?
dialog: Rare to get it, hard to keep it. This
dialog: is a damn slippery planet.
text: When she said this she was staring out to sea. Now she turns
text: to look at Graham and puts a hand on his arm. He still stares
dialog: out to sea:
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Slick as hell.
text: Then Graham looks at her and covers her hand with his own.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You remember when we first met?
dialog: And were together alone in that
dialog: room. And the exhilaration was
dialog: too much to hold on to. And then
dialog: something flickered across your
dialog: face like a shadow and I asked you
dialog: what was wrong?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I remember.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Do you remember what you said?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes. I said this is too good to live...

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: I need to ask you questions of a
dialog: psychological nature.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Remember when you asked for a
dialog: study on him, I refused. Same
dialog: goes for now.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: That was Peterson upstairs.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: It was you who did the asking.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: He doesn't think you run mind games
text: on him.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: I wouldn't presume to try.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: You're never alone in a room with
dialog: Graham, are you? You're smooth
dialog: about it, but you're never one-on-
dialog: one with him. Why's that? Do you
dialog: think he's psychic?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: He's an eideteker. He has almost
dialog: total recall. But I don't think
dialog: he's psychic. What he has it empathy
dialog: and projection He can assume your
dialog: point of view and mine.., and some
dialog: other points of view that scare and
dialog: sicken him.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Why aren't you ever alone with him?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Because I'm professionally
dialog: concerned about him. And he'd
dialog: pick up on that. He's fast. He
text: hates being prodded and poked.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So do I.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs.
dialog: Could he kill again if he had to save
dialog: his life? Or would he hesitate?
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: I'll tell you the events. The
dialog: psychology's none of your business.
dialog: Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven-
dialog: year-old daughter's throat. Graham
text: shot him with his .38 six times.
text: Hobbs still didn't go down. He had
dialog: to wade in...
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: That's when it happened?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: No. It happened when Graham went
dialog: to see Hobbs' daughter four months
dialog: later in the hospital. She saved
dialog: her carotid artery.., but lost
text: three fingers and her larynx. She
text: was connected up to a voice box.
dialog: When Graham went to see her, she
dialog: asked him -- through the speaker:
dialog: 'Why did you have to kill my
dialog: daddy? '
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's when Graham had his nervous
dialog: breakdown.
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: What's the bottom line?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: If he pushes too deep into our boy's
text: mind-set, he may destroy himself.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What are you planning, Jack?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: Could he handle a direct contact?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: I don't recommend it.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM (O.S.)
dialog: You don't recommend what, Sidney?
text: Crawford is surprised at Graham's entry. Bloom isn't.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Crawford has a proposition. I
dialog: don't think it's a good idea.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: If the Tooth Fairy listens to
dialog: Lecktor, he'll come for me. So
dialog: we're going to set me up as bait
dialog: to draw him out. Give him a
dialog: clean shot.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: GRAHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's what you were thinking,

speaker_heading: GXAHAM

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: BLOOM
text: He may have an unconscious

dialog: I believe he did this to emphasize

text: Graham motions Lounds to turn the tape recorder on again.

text: and slams into the station wall. CANS CRASH and roll away...
dialog: Dollarhyde does know what he can do about it.
speaker_heading: REBA'S FACE

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT

speaker_heading: DOLLARHYDE
text: pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. He

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT

speaker_heading: DOLLARHYDE
dialog: I ought to jam this in your chest,
dialog: and drain your heart...
text: The Attendant tries to say he's sorry, but he can't talk.

speaker_heading: CRAWFORD (V.O.)

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: GRAMPA (V.0.)
dialog: Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?!

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: You know Lounds's enlightened me on

dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: I want to help you, Will. You'd be

dialog: natures, They're issued to us.
dialog: Along with our lungs and pancreas
dialog: and everything else. Why fight it?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Fight what?
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: When you were so depressed after
dialog: you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to
dialog: death, it wasn't the act that got
dialog: you down. Didn't you really feel
dialog: so bad because killing him felt so
dialog: good?
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: And why shouldn't it feel good?! It
dialog: must feel good to God. God does it
dialog: all the time!
text: Graham laughs. Then he starts to listen closely. There is

speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: You should, Will. God's terrific!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He dropped a church roof on thirty-

dialog: (beat)
dialog: He wouldn't begrudge you two measly

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Why does it feel good?
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: It feels good because: if you do as

text: Will Graham thinks about this.
speaker_heading: LECKTOR
dialog: (fading)
dialog: God's a champ! He got a hundred and

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LEEDS HOUSE - GRAHAM - DAY

text: he walks forward...
scene_heading: STAIRCASE - GRAHAM'S FEET UP TIIE STAIRS

speaker_heading: GRAHAM (O.S.)

scene_heading: INT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM: THE DOOR
text: It opens. Graham enters. The room is white. We don't see

dialog: We will see what Graham sees in his mind.
speaker_heading: CRAHAM

scene_heading: GRAHAM'S POV: THE BED
text: The ceiling and walls decomposing. Nothing falls on the bed.

text: A silent shot shoves her back to the headboard. Red blood
text: starts to stain her nightgown as she holds the wound. We
text: FLOAT CLOSER. In SLOW MOTION Mr. Leeds starts to rise.
text: Something massive and silver flashes through the FRAME. He Is
text: gone. Mirrors explode. Mrs. Leeds was looking at her hand
text: covered with blood. Now Mrs. Leeds looks up at us. Her face
text: turns into a smile. Her eyes are silver. A silver light
text: emanates from her mouth. She smiles at us. She wants us. She

dialog: CLOSER we hear:
speaker_heading: GRAHAM (O.S.)
dialog: You will be better than anything...

speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: He used a boltcutter to trim the
text: branch out of his way. When he
dialog: was watching from the woods. Why
dialog: didn't he use it to go through the
dialog: basement door?
speaker_heading: CRAWFORD
text: Because a steel door and deadbolt

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You mean Jacobi put it in between

speaker_heading: CRAWFORD

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
