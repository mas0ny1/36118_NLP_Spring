speaker_heading: THE
speaker_heading: DEAD
dialog: (The original script)
dialog: by George A. Romero
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 1	EXT. THE EMPTY STREET OF A CITY - DAY
text: No people. A FEW CARS AND TRUCKS are parked at odd angles, abandoned.
text: A TITLE FADES IN, one phrase at a time.
dialog: FIVE YEARS...
text: SINCE THE DEAD FIRST WALKED.
scene_heading: 2	EXT. THE CITY - DAY
text: We hear THE SOUND OF A STRONG WIND. DEBRIS flutters through the
text: streets. A LARGE ALLIGATOR slithers into frame, stops and looks
dialog: around.
text: MONTAGE: as MORE GATORS explore the empty streets, knocking over
text: GARBAGE CANS, upsetting the MANNEQUINS in A DEPARTMENT STORE WINDOW.
text: A GATOR crawls out through the open doors of AN ABANDONED BANK. LOOSE
text: BILLS are dragged along under the animal's tail. They flutter away on
speaker_heading: the WIND.
scene_heading: 3	EXT. THE CITY - DAY
text: GATORS crawl over A '79 CADELLIC. A FEMALE SKELETON sits slumped over
text: the steering wheel. In the back a BABY'S BONES are strapped into AN
text: INFANT'S SAFETY SEAT. One of the gators THUMPS its tail maddeningly
text: against the windshield. ANOTHER TITLE APPEAR:
speaker_heading: FLORIDA - 1987
scene_heading: 4	EXT. THE CITY - DAY
text: CLOSE ON A SECTION OF PAVEMENT as we hear THE SOUND OF SLUGGISH
text: FOOTSTEPS approaching. A SHADOW appears at the bottom of the frame.
text: It gets longer and takes on the shape of a man.
text: TIGHT ON THE AFTERNOON SUN, blinding us. Into the FOREGROUND lurches
text: THE FIGURE which cast the shadow. Glare obscures all facial detail
text: until the head jogs into position directly in front of the fiery ball
text: in the sky. Then we see its hideous, dead eyes, its blue-grey colour,
text: the blackened wound where a large portion of jaw has been ripped
text: away. This is a ZOMBIE! A MUSIC CHORD SOUNDS and THE MAIN TITLE
speaker_heading: APPEARS:
speaker_heading: DAY OF THE DEAD
scene_heading: 5	EXT. THE CITY - DAY
text: HEAD CREDITS ROLL over A MONTAGE: the CITY STREETS are now populated
text: by the WALKING DEAD. In every shape, size and colour they wander,
text: without purpose, up and down the avenues, in and out of buildings.
text: The city is theirs, they have inherited the place. Man, in his human
text: form, seems to be gone.
text: As the CREDITS END, we CUT TO:
scene_heading: 6	EXT. A MAIN STREET - DAY
text: We are looking down from a HIGH ANGLE. The corner of A TALL BUILDING
text: is in the FOREGROUND. A CORPSE is dangling from A NOOSE. It's been
text: dead for some time. It's mostly bone now, its blackened flesh picked
text: clean by scavenger birds and harbour rats. A SIGN flaps against its
text: chest cavity. Its hurriedly scrawled message reads: TAKE ME, LORD! I
dialog: LOVE YOU!
text: THE ROPE BREAKS suddenly and THE CORPSE FALLS out of frame.
scene_heading: 7	EXT. THE STREET - DAY
text: We're at GROUND LEVEL now...SMACK!!! THE CORPSE HITS THE PAVEMENT and
text: SHATTERS as though made of potter's clay. BONES bounce over a wide
text: area. THE SIGN is carried off by the WIND.
scene_heading: 8	EXT. AN ABANDONED MARINA - DAY
text: THE SIGN gallops across the grass of A HARBOUR PARK towards the water
text: where A FEW DERELICT BOATS sway in the WIND.
text: Slowly, THE SOUND OF A MOTOR FADES IN.
scene_heading: 9	EXT. THE MARINA (CLOSER ANGLE) - DAY
text: A FISHING BOATS, old and sea-worn, chugs into the harbour.
scene_heading: 10	EXT. THE MARINA (CLOSE ON THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY
text: There are people on board, THREE MEN AND TWO WOMEN. They look like
dialog: guerilleros from somewhere in Latin America. They're heavily armed,
text: unshaven, covered with months worth of jungle crud. They are
text: obviously exhausted. They gaze up to the city. Their deep-sunken eyes
dialog: are too war-weary to show much emotion but we can read their despair.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Another dead place. I tol' you. Let's get
dialog: out to the islands.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: The radio signals were coming from this
dialog: area.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Not from the city. In every city it's the
dialog: same. Dead. Let's get out to the barrier
dialog: islands. If there are survivors sending
dialog: those signals that's where we'll find them.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Plenty of time for the islands. The rest of
dialog: our...life...on the islands...I think.
text: Miguel is drifting. The sight of the dead city has pushed him a few
text: inches closer to the brink of insanity. He catches himself and comes
text: back toward reality.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: We gotta see if there are others here. We
dialog: came all this way. We're gonna check it
dialog: out.
scene_heading: 11	EXT. THE MARINA (AT THE DOCKS) - DAY
text: CLOSE ON THE OPEN GASOLINE RECEPTACLE in the hull of AN ABANDONED
text: BOAT. A WOMAN'S HANDS shove a LENGTH OF HOSE down into the hole.
text: The woman, MARIA, puts the other end of the hose to her mouth and
text: sucks the air out.
text: At ANOTHER DERELICT BOAT, TONY sucks on ANOTHER HOSE.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Ptoooo! Nothing! Dry as a bone. No gas.
dialog: Let's get outa here.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Check them all. And check the tanks under
dialog: the pumps.
dialog: 
text: MIGUEL and the other two guerilleros, SARAH AND CHICO, start to walk
text: up the dock towards the harbour park, toward the city. MIGUEL has AN
text: ELECTRONIC BULLHORN in one hand, his AUTOMATIC RIFLE ready in the
dialog: other.
scene_heading: 12	EXT. THE HARBOUR PARK - DAY
text: THE TRIO of refugees move across the grass. The WIND blows DEBRIS
text: around them as they stare towards the downtown buildings. MIGUEL
text: lifts THE BULLHORN to his mouth.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: HELLO. IS THERE ANYONE THERE? HELLO.
text: HELLOOOOOOO....
scene_heading: 13 	EXT. THE CITY - DAY
text: MONTAGE: as THE WALKING DEAD hear that human VOICE. Throughout the
text: city they turned towards THE SOUND, at once confused and excited.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (o.s.)
text: HELLOOOOOOOOOOO....
text: THE DEAD start to GROAN hungrily, almost pleadingly. All over the
speaker_heading: city their VOICES RISE.
scene_heading: 14	EXT. THE HARBOUR PARK - DAY
text: It comes to MIGUEL AND THE OTHERS as A MASSIVE WALL OF NOISE, THE
text: SOUND of hundreds-of-thousands of damned souls moaning on one solid
text: voice. The sound of hell on earth.
scene_heading: 15	EXT. THE MARINA (AT THE DOCKS) - DAY
text: TONY AND MARIA hear it as well and feel the familiar grip of cold
text: fear. Maria makes the sign of the cross.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Dios mia.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead
dialog: place. Like all the others.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 16	EXT. THE CITY (FROM THE WATER) - DAY
text: We see the place FROM A GREAT DISTANCE. In the FOREGROUND THE FISHING
text: BOAT, with all five REFUGEES back on board, chugs into open waters.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 17	EXT.	A SMALL PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
text: Away from the city, this dock is wooden, rickety. DERELICT BOATS rust
text: at their moorings. THE FISHING BOAT is tied-on at one end of the pier
text: and THE GUERILLEROS are moving through the area, scavenging. This
text: time CHICO helps MARIA with the SIPHON HOSES. TONY lingers sullenly
text: near the fishing boat which has its motor still idling.
text: MARIA'S SIPHON HOSE is stuffed into the gas tank of A LARGE TRAWLER.
text: She sucks on the hose and, unexpectedly, foul tasting liquid fills
dialog: her mouth.
speaker_heading: MARIA
scene_heading: AY! GASOLINA! GASOLINA!
text: Without warning, A FIGURE pops up from behind the side wall of the
text: trawler. He reaches out and grabs the woman, pulling her against the
text: boat, his arm around her neck, a pistol to her head.
text: TONY sees the action. He dives into the fishing boat, crawls over to
text: his RIFLE and scrambles towards the pilot's controls.
text: With a lightning move, MARIA pulls A KNIFE from her belt. She
text: wrenches around and PLUNGES THE BLADE INTO HER ATTACKER'S CHEST. The
text: man staggers back, screaming. MARIA breaks away and runs across the
text: dock. THE MAN FIRES HIS PISTOL wildly.
text: MARIA IS HIT IN THE ARM. She tumbles forwards onto the decking.
text: TONY reacts, OPENING FIRE WITH HIS AUTOMATIC.
text: BULLETS RIP INTO THE ATTACKERS CHEST: HE FALLS OUT OF THE TRAWLER
text: onto the dock, but TWO MORE GUNMEN appear behind him, mean-looking
text: desperadoes with RIFLE SPITTING LEAD.
text: TONY ducks as low as he can. He grabs the controls and pilots the
text: fishing boat along the edge of the dock toward the downed woman.
scene_heading: 18	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
text: MIGUEL, SARAH AND CHICO react to the gunfire. They draw their WEAPONS
dialog: and look for cover.
text: They are at the far end of the dock, their backs to the sea. There is
text: a WORK SHED nearby. BULLETS WHIZ past them as they charge towards the
text: wooden structure. They make it there safely and they begin to RETURN
text: FIRE. A gun battle ensues between the two groups.
scene_heading: 19	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
text: MARIA, her ARM BLEEDING, rolls off the dock and into THE FISHING
text: BOAT. TONY guns the engine and the boat pulls out into open water.
text: THE ATTACKERS try to FIRE AT THE ESCAPING BOAT but they are forced to
text: duck BULLETS which RICOCHET OFF THE TRAWLER pinning them down.
scene_heading: 20	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
text: MIGUEL'S RIFLE is in his right hand. His left hand clings to the
text: frame of AN OPEN WINDOW on his side of the shed. There's a SUDDEN,
text: STARTLING MUSIC STING and, with it, A ZOMBIE appears inside the open
text: window. Grotesque and drooling dark SALIVA, its hungry mouth lunges
text: at MIGUEL'S left arm. ITS TEETH TEAR A LARGE STRIP OF FLESH OUT OF
text: THE ARM six inches above the wrist.
text: MIGUEL screams. He pulls away from the creature, his terrified eyes
text: staring at the BLEEDING WOUND. A zombie bite means infection and
dialog: almost certain death.
text: THE ZOMBIE leans out through the open window, its hands clawing the
text: air trying to reach MIGUEL. SARAH pulls A GIANT .45 from her holster
text: belt. BULLAMN! BULLAMN! BULLAMN! She FIRES three rapid shots.
text: THE SKULL OF THE ZOMBIE INDENTS IN FRONT like a hard-boiled egg shell
text: that's been whacked with a spoon bowl. BLACKENED BLOOD AND BRAIN
text: MATTER FLIES OUT OF THE BACK where the bullets exit. The creature
dialog: falls, destroyed.
scene_heading: 21	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
text: SARAH acts quickly. She lunges towards CHICO and snatches A MACHETE
text: out of his belt. CHICO shows concern but he's busy RETURNING FIRE at
text: THE ATTACKERS on the trawler.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I have to stop the infection... Querrida...
dialog: 
text: MIGUEL looks into SARAH'S eyes. He has started to tremble. A cry of
text: primal panic is gurgling up in his throat. With a sudden move, SARAH
text: slams her RIFLE BUTT into the side of his head with all her might. He
text: reels backwards and slams into the boathouse wall. His eyes roll but
text: he stays on his feet, still conscious.
text: CHICO steps away from his post and stands squarely in front of
text: MIGUEL. WHAP! He slugs him with a powerhouse right-cross. MIGUEL
text: still stands. WHAP! He slugs him again. WHAP! Again. Finally, MIGUEL
text: collapses into the man's arms and CHICO lays the limp body down on
dialog: the deck.
text: BUDDABLAM! RATTATATTATATTATATT! THE ENEMY, sensing an upper hand,
text: starts FIRING WITH MORE INTENSITY. CHICO steps away from MIGUEL and
text: SENDS SOME LEAD BACK their way.
scene_heading: 22	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
text: SARAH is crying. It's not weakness. She's crying for MIGUEL, crying
text: for his pain. But she doesn't hesitate in what she has to do. She
text: crouches over the BITTEN ARM and raises the MACHETE over her head.
text: THUCK! SHE CHOPS AT THE ELBOW JOINT with all her strength. THE BLADE
text: BITES DEEP BUT DOESN'T CUT THROUGH. SHE LIFTS IT AND CHOPS AGAIN AND
text: AGAIN....THUCK! THUCK! Then SHE DIGS AROUND, searching for the joint
text: the way she might on a turkey drumstick. Finding the spot, SHE PUSHES
text: DOWN WITH BOTH HANDS, leaning all her weight on the top edge of the
text: blade. TEARS are running down her cheeks when THE BIG KNIFE
text: FINALLY.... THUMMMPPP!....CUTS THROUGH TO THE DECKING.
text: Repulsed, angry, SARAH SWEEPS THE SEVERED FOREARM AWAY WITH THE BLADE
text: the way a butcher might sweep away unwanted fat. BLOOD IS SPURTING
text: OUT OF THE STUMP at an alarming rate. SARAH has to act quickly again.
text: While CHICO continues to RETURN FIRE at the enemy, SARAH swings
text: herself up onto the sill of the open boathouse window and disappears
dialog: inside the place.
scene_heading: 23	INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY
text: The place is dark and cluttered (oars, bait buckets, fishing gear,
text: life preservers, tools, paints, varnishes). SARAH snatches up AN AXE
speaker_heading: HANDLE.
text: THE ZOMBIE that bit Miguel lies nearby with its skull laid open. Its
text: hand is jogged, startingly, when SARAH grabs A BOTTLE OF PAINT
text: THINNER from the floor beside the corpse.
text: From out of the shadows...A HAND! It grabs SARAH'S ankle. She kicks
text: violently and pulls away. ANOTHER ZOMBIE is crawling across the
text: floor. ONE OF ITS LEGS IS MISSING AND THE OTHER IS BADLY DAMAGED.
text: SARAH draws her .45 and BULLAMM! BULLAMM! SHE PUMPS TWO ROUNDS INTO
text: THE CREATURE'S BRAIN.
scene_heading: 24	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
text: CHICO ducks the enemy's RICOCHETING BULLETS.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: HEY ! WHAT ARE WE DOIN' THIS FOR? WE CAN
dialog: STICK TOGETHER. WE CAN USE EACH OTHER'S
speaker_heading: GUNS.
text: At THE TRAWLER, ONE OF THE ATTACKERS shouts a response.
speaker_heading: ATTACKER #1
dialog: You could use our guns, maybe. We can't use
dialog: yours. Unless you can get yer boat back
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: You got a boat.
speaker_heading: ATTACKER #1
dialog: Shit, man. We can drift this tub into the
dialog: bay...tow her around with a dinghy...but
dialog: she ain't gonna get us nowhere. Ev'ry boat
dialog: you see here is long dead, soldier...else
dialog: we'd be long gone. Can you get your boat
dialog: back here?
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: I don't know where they went, man. I don't
dialog: know. I swear.
speaker_heading: ATTACKER #1
dialog: Then, like I said...we can't use you. We
dialog: ain't got the food nor the patience to put
dialog: up with you.
text: The man FIRES A LONG BURST from his automatic.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: YOU....YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!
text: He reaches around the corner of the shed with his own rifle and FIRES
text: blind in return. SARAH clambers out through the shed windows having
text: wrapped A LARGE PIECE OF CLOTH around the end of the AXE HANDLE.
dialog: 
text: She reaches into a shirt pocket and produces A WOODEN MATCH. She
text: strikes the match and touches the flame to the thinner-soaked cloth.
text: PHOOOOOMPH! The axe handle becomes an angrily flaming torch.
scene_heading: 25	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
text: As the gun battle continues, SARAH crouches over MIGUEL. BLOOD IS
text: STILL FOUNTAINING FROM THE STUMP OF HIS LEFT ARM. The woman slaps THE
text: FLAMING END OF HER TORCH ONTO THE STUMP. There's A SIZZLING SOUND as
text: the raw flesh there cooks.
text: The pain reaches MIGUEL even though his unconscious state. He starts
text: to breathe heavily. His head shakes from side to side silently
dialog: pleading "NO, NO, NO." The flames do their job. THE FLESH CRUSTS OVER
text: AND THE BLEEDING STOPS.
text: MIGUEL'S SHIRT CATCHES. Suddenly his eyes pop open and he screams
text: like the man on fire he is. He lurches away from the flame, his body
text: slamming against the shed wall. SARAH flings the torch into the water
text: and dives on top of the man.
speaker_heading: SARAH
scene_heading: MIGUELITO. MI VIDA. MIGUEL MIO.
text: MIGUEL, trying to scream but needing to vomit, is doing neither. His
text: body is convulsing in the woman's arms. She rubs the sparks on his
text: shirt until they disappear then she caresses him, holding his head
text: against hers, rocking him back and forth.
scene_heading: 26	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
text: CHICO is still busy RETURNING FIRE. BULLETS WHIZ through the air
text: around his head. ONE KNICKS HIM ON THE SHOULDER, a superficial but
dialog: painful wound.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: JESUS CHRIST! GET UP HERE, WOMAN! GET THE
dialog: HELL UP HERE!
text: SARAH has no choice but to help in the fight. She lays MIGUEL as
text: gently as she can on his back. He's gone into deep shock, shivering
text: violently. Rubbing tears away from her eyes, SARAH jumps to her feet,
text: takes up a post and begins to FIRE AT THE ATTACKERS.
text: THE ATTACKERS are grinning like old-fashioned pirates as their GUNS
text: CHEW UP THE DOCK. Suddenly, just behind THE TRAWLER, we see A FLASH
text: OF COLOUR SPEEDING BY...
text: It's THE FISHING BOAT! The WOUNDED MARIA is steering. TONY is
text: standing on the prow with his RIFLE FIRING...
dialog: RATTATATTATATTATATTATATT!!!!
text: ONE OF THE ATTACKERS IS HIT FROM BEHIND. HIS BACK TURNS SOLID RED and
text: HE PITCHES FORWARDS, FALLING between the boat and the dock into the
dialog: water below.
text: THE OTHER ATTACKER (#1) turns and FIRES IN RESPONSE. TONY IS HIT IN
text: THE STOMACH. He falls to his knees and grabs the side of the boat but
text: he KEEPS FIRING.
text: THE ATTACKER pivots against a mast. For a moment he doesn't realise
text: that HIS NECK HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN BY A LINE OF BULLETS. He tries to
text: scream. Can't. A PLUME OF RED SHOOT OUT OF HIS MOUTH. Then he
text: realises. He realises that he's a dead man. He falls.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: TONY....TONY....
speaker_heading: TONY
text: PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
text: TONY is clutching at his BLEEDING BELLY as MARIA, in pain from her
text: own wound, circles the boat towards the edge of the dock.
scene_heading: 27	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
text: Behind the boathouse, SARAH slings her rifle onto her shoulder and
text: she leans over MIGUEL who is now catatonic.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Help me get him to the boat.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: Leave him.
text: SARAH calmly raises her .45 and aims it directly at CHICO's head.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Help me or die.
text: Reluctantly the man moves towards MIGUEL and the two survivors drag
text: his limp body over the decking.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 28	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - SUNSET
text: The fishing boat is gone. Orange light from the western horizon
text: paints the scene. FIGURES are moving about on the dock, slumped,
text: lumbering figures....ZOMBIES.
text: They're clustering around THE TRAWLER, around THE CORPSES OF THE
speaker_heading: ATTACKERS.
text: THEY BEGIN PULLING THOSE CORPSES APART AND EATING THEM HUNGRILY.
text: ONE CREATURE has found MIGUEL'S SEVERED FOREARM. IT PULLS A BIG CHUNK
text: OFF THE THING WITH ITS TEETH. It chews for a time, ITS DROOL TURNING
text: RED. Then it spits out MIGUEL'S WRISTWATCH as though it was a
dialog: bothersome bit of bone.
scene_heading: 29	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - SUNSET
text: THE TWO WOMEN hover over their wounded, TONY AND MIGUEL. CHICO steers
text: the boat. Suddenly, TONY arches his back and screams in pain.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily
dialog: sorry...for having offended
dialog: Thee....offended Thee...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I detest all my sins...because... because
dialog: of Thy just punishment... because of
dialog: Thy...just...punish...
text: A coughing fit interrupts his Act of Contrition. From across the open
text: cabin, from within SARAH'S arms, MIGUEL stares. His eyes have the
text: glaze of a madman's eyes. Despite that, and despite the physical
text: trauma he has endured, he seems remarkably in command.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: He is dying. I will end his pain.
text: MIGUEL draws his PISTOL.
speaker_heading: MARIA
speaker_heading: NOOOOOOOOO!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: ...but most of all because...they offend
dialog: Thee, my God...Who art all good...and
dialog: deserving...deserving of all my love...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
text: He is dying. He knows it.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You are dying, too.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No. The disease was cut away from me. I
dialog: will live. I will live.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I firmly resolve...with the... with the
dialog: help...the help of...of Thy grace...
text: TONY collapses. A long, gurgling breath of surrender spills out of
text: him and BLOOD TRICKLES FROM HIS LIFELESS MOUTH.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Tony...TONY!
text: The woman folds TONY'S corpse into her arms as though trying to give
text: it life from her own wounded body. For a long moment there is only
text: the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the tired engine. Then the woman, sensing
text: something, turns back towards MIGUEL. His pistol is raised, aimed at
text: TONY'S head.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: NO! YOU CAN'T!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It must be done. You know this. It must by
dialog: done to keep him from...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: It won't happen to him! It won't happen to
dialog: him! You heard his prayer. His prayer will
dialog: save him. He could never become one
dialog: of...one of those... devils.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Prayers have no power to save. The knife
dialog: can save. It can cut the disease away. The
dialog: bullet. It can shatter the brain where the
dialog: evil takes seed. These are saviours...our
dialog: new saviours...our only saviours.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: We must wait. One day the curse will pass.
dialog: One day a dead man will... will...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: One day a dead man will refuse to return,
dialog: and that man will be a saint. The first
dialog: saint of our century. That's a prayer, too.
dialog: A catechism. Something the priests tell us
dialog: to believe.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you
dialog: if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do
dialog: it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to
dialog: be done.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No. You won't be able to do it. He will
dialog: rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
text: That madman's glaze is wet in MIGUEL'S eyes again. A grin curls his
text: mouth into an odd shape. He freezes, staring, waiting. SARAH shows
dialog: concern.
scene_heading: 30	EXT. DEEP WATER (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - NIGHT
text: A CRESCENT MOON lies on its back. Below, on the pitch black water,
text: its reflection, a vertical stripe, breaks open as THE BOAT passes
scene_heading: through it...CHUG-CHUG-CHUG.
scene_heading: 31	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - NIGHT
text: CHICO has fallen asleep at the tiller. SARAH is asleep as well, and
dialog: so is MARIA.
text: A SILENT SHADOW moves over the side rail. HANDS reach out and grip
text: MARIA'S shoulders, lifting her up, up from sleep. Her eyes flutter
dialog: open.
text: TONY'S face is blue-grey in the moonlight. It takes the woman a
dialog: second or two to recognise that HE IS ONE OF THE LIVING DEAD. His
text: hungry mouth lunges towards her neck. His DROOLING TEETH SINK DEEP.
text: The woman screams.
text: SARAH wakes with a start. MIGUEL is already awake. He's been watching
text: all along. Now he watches still, his PISTOL idle in his one good
text: hand, his mouth curled in that strange grin, as MARIA'S screams
text: shatter the quiet night.
text: At the tiller, CHICO sees what's happening. He fumbles for the
text: AUTOMATIC RIFLE that's strapped over his shoulder.
text: A PORK-CHOP-SIZE CHUNK COMES OUT OF MARIA'S NECK IN THE CLENCHED
scene_heading: TEETH OF THE TONY-CREATURE. BLOOD SQUIRTS UPWARD IN A FIVE-FOOT ARC.
text: SARAH lifts her RIFLE from her lap. She is the first to FIRE. An
text: instant later, CHICO FIRES as well.
text: THE HEAD ON THE TONY-CREATURE IS HIT BY RAPID-FIRE LOADS from each
text: gun and IT COME APART ABOVE THE EYES. Its body staggers stiffly into
text: MARIA. She tries to stand, tries to pull away, screams still bubbling
text: in her torn throat. She topples backward over the side rail. The
text: corpse, taller and heavier, flips rigidly over, its feet kicking
text: skyward, and splashes in to the deep, black Gulf.
text: MARIA, the small of her back balanced precariously on the side rail,
text: grabs at the air trying to swing her weight back on board. SARAH
text: springs forward. She reaches the other woman a second too late. Their
text: hands brush but don't catch. MARIA slips over the side. A LOUD SPLASH
text: CUTS OFF HER SCREAMS.
text: CHICO brings the boat about in as tight a circle as possible. He and
text: SARAH stare out over the water. The blackness out there is absolute.
dialog: Visibility zero.
text: Silence....but for the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the boat's engine.
text: MIGUEL slowly raises his hand and aims his PISTOL at a LARGE, TURTLE-
text: SHAPED SPLOTCH OF BLOOD on the hull across the cabin, the spot where
text: TONY died. With that odd grin still on his lips, HE BEGINS TO FIRE
text: one shot at a time in deliberate, slow rhythm.
text: THE BULLETS PUNCH HOLES through the wooden side-wall, most of them
text: hitting squarely in the blood stain.
text: SARAH looks over toward CHICO who returns her look with frightened
dialog: eyes.
scene_heading: 32	EXT. GASPARILLA'S ISLAND (EST.) - DAY
text: It looks like a tropical paradise. Greatly separated from the other
text: smaller islands on the horizon, its vegetation is dense and lush.
dialog: There's no sign that civilisation ever invaded the place, no power
text: lines, no buildings. What meets the eye is all natural and inviting.
text: THE FISHING BOAT chugs into a tidewater basin on the afternoon side
dialog: of the island.
scene_heading: 33	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN THE BASIN) - DAY
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: It looks uninhabited. What do you think?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I think we should burn the church. Kill the
dialog: priest and burn the church. It's the only
dialog: way. The only way.
text: MIGUEL is sweating profusely yet shivering as though cold. FLIES ARE
text: BUZZING in a cluster around his WRAPPED STUMP. He's over the edge
dialog: now, insane. And worse than that, the infection from the original
text: bite is spreading. The amputation was not done quickly enough to
text: prevent the parasites from racing through his veins to the brain and
dialog: elsewhere.
text: SARAH turns towards the madman once her lover. Her heart is too
text: callused for emotion to reach it. She just stares, her eyes dead cold
text: like the eyes of a shark.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: I'm pullin' in.
scene_heading: 34	EXT. THE ISLAND (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY
text: THE BOAT noses into a swamp water backwash. Tall reeds and cypress
text: moss camouflage it completely. It's at though the boat is sailing
text: right onto dry land.
speaker_heading: SHOCK CUT TO:
scene_heading: 35	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE INLET - DAY
text: THWOCK! CLOSE ON A MACHETE. The blade chops into the top of a
dialog: coconut.
text: CHICO drinks the milk. SARAH sits on a nearby rock, her RIFLE AND A
text: BACK-PACK full of supplies strapped over her shoulders.
text: MIGUEL, his madman's eyes wide with excitement, is trotting urgently
text: from spot to spot where a spectacular specie of sub-tropical plant
text: grows. There are hundreds of them, six-feet tall and flowering. Their
text: red-gold blossoms are shaped like trumpets hanging with their bells
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: DATURA!!! DATURA!!! MIRA. DATURA!!!
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: What's he saying?
dialog: 
text: SARAH shrugs, not knowing. CHICO looks down at her, empathising.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: His madness....could be from shock.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I
dialog: know.
text: (She speaks softly, matter-of-factly)
dialog: Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like
dialog: Maria. I'll shoot him.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: DATURA!!! DATURA!!! DATURA METEL!!!
scene_heading: 36	EXT. THE INLAND JUNGLE - DAY
text: THE GUERILLEROS hack their way through thick undergrowth with
text: MACHETES. MIGUEL is ineffectual. He lags behind the others who are
text: doing trailblazing. THE SOUNDS OF WILDLIFE, excited by the intruders,
text: fill the close, humid air, sometimes beautiful, sometimes grotesque,
dialog: sometimes startling.
scene_heading: 37	EXT. A SWAMPY AREA - DAY
text: ALLIGATORS lurk and SNAKES slither among the reeds. A FOURTEEN FOOT
text: GATOR opens its jaws wide making a SOUND LIKE ESCAPING STEAM. CHICO
text: draws his PISTOL but SARAH reaches out to grab his hand.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. No shooting. Not until we're sure we're
dialog: alone on this island.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No. No, thank you. No ice. Straight up,
dialog: please. No ice. Thank you.
text: MIGUEL'S eyes roll up into his head. His knees buckle. SARAH grabs
text: him under the arms barely keeping from falling face first into the
text: muddy swamp water. CHICO comes to help.
scene_heading: 38	EXT. THE SWAMP - DAY
text: THE TWO drag MIGUEL to the edge of dry land. They flop him onto his
text: back and SARAH puts her canteen to his lips.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: NO ICE, I SAID!!! NOOOOO ICE!!!
text: He slams his good hand against the canteen, knocking it away. It
text: plops into the marsh water, its contents lost.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Burn the church. Kill the priest and burn
dialog: the church. Burn....
text: His mouth keeps on shaping words but no sound comes out. He squirms
text: for a moment, then he seems to fall asleep.
text: CHICO looks down at him. Unable to help, he moves off towards solid
text: ground and disappears in the thick brush. After a time, SARAH follows
dialog: after him.
scene_heading: 39	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY
text: CHICO is at the edge of a clearing when SARAH reaches him. His eyes
text: are wide, frightened by what they see.
text: In the ground before them there's AN ENORMOUS IRON PLATE, fifty feet
text: by ten, all painted in brown and green camouflage patterns.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I
dialog: dunno.
text: Suddenly there's A GREAT RUMBLING, like the giant gears and pistons
text: of a drawbridge being activated. The iron plate shudders and starts
text: to move, downward, into the earth. SARAH AND CHICO duck into the
dialog: nearby jungle.
scene_heading: 40	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY
text: They take cover in a thicket, both their GUNS up and ready. OTHER
text: SOUNDS can be heard now, clunking sounds of metal on metal, and a few
text: heavy thuds. There are also VOICES on the wind but their words are
dialog: indistinguishable.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: It's some kind of....elevator. There must
dialog: be something under the ground
dialog: here....maybe....military.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Look.
scene_heading: 41	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE (THEIR P.O.V.) - DAY
text: SEVERAL FIGURES are rising up in to view, a dozen, maybe fifteen.
text: Details are obscured by FOREGROUND FOLIAGE but we can read helmets,
text: heavy armaments, packs, utility belts. The impression is of a ghostly
text: cadre of soldiers rising from hell.
speaker_heading: SARAH (o.s.)
dialog: Jesus Christ!
speaker_heading: CHICO (o.s.)
dialog: It is military. I don't believe it.
scene_heading: 42	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better
dialog: look.
text: She moves to another spot a few feet away. CHICO follows.
scene_heading: 43	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE (THEIR P.O.V.) - DAY
text: THE PLATOON OF SOLDIERS, still obscured by foliage, moves off into
text: the jungle carrying A COLLECTION OF PARAPHERNALIA.
text: There are THREE SOLDIERS who do not move off with the others. They
text: are standing still with their shoulders slumped, their heads lolling
text: listlessly from side to side. They have the body attributes of
dialog: prisoners yet there's something menacing about them. We HEAR A SERIES
text: OF ELECTRONIC BEEPS, something like computer beeps, and, as though in
text: response to that signal, the three slumped figures start to walk.
text: They move slowly, stiffly, their feet shuffling, their arms dangling
text: lifelessly at their sides.
speaker_heading: SARAH (o.s.)
dialog: Oh....oh, my God.
scene_heading: 44	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY
text: SARAH'S eyes are wide in their sockets with disbelief, revulsion,
text: horror. Beside her CHICO, also astonished, makes the sign of the
dialog: cross.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: OH, MY GOD!!!
scene_heading: 45	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY
text: As we CUT IN CLOSER we see that the three slumped figures are
text: ZOMBIES. They are wearing khakis and they are armed with RIFLES AND
text: PISTOL BELTS. Their HELMETS have been painted an identifying bright
text: RED and they wear slipover vests dyed the same bright colour.
text: All the others in the platoon are humans. They, too, wear vests but
text: theirs are not red but WHITE, WITH LARGE ORANGE CIRCLES emblazoned
text: front and back. Two of the men wield LONG ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS for
dialog: use should the ZOMBIES misbehave, but the creatures, amazingly, are
text: shambling along with the rest of the platoon voluntarily, co-
text: operatively, even somewhat excitedly....the kind of excitement seen
text: in a puppy that's just learned a new trick.
scene_heading: 46	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Come on.
text: Stealthily the woman moves along the edge of the thicket, crouching
text: all the while. CHICO hesitantly follows.
scene_heading: 47	EXT. A CLEARING - DAY
text: The mysterious PLATOON begins "setting up" their equipment, which
scene_heading: includes TRIPOD MACHINE GUNS. TWO MEN don BLACK RUBBER GLOVES AND
scene_heading: LONG BLACK LABORATORY APRONS. They strap LARGE REFRIGERATED CARTONS
text: around their necks and open the sealed lids. VAPOUR mushrooms out
text: like dry-ice vapour out of Good Humour wagons on a hot day.
scene_heading: 48	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: SARAH AND CHICO watch. Suddenly THE HUGE, FULL-THROATED SOUND OF A
text: SIREN startles them. They look around, up into the trees. SARAH spots
dialog: something and points.
text: CLOSE ON A SIREN HORN, high in the cypresses, its wires running down
text: to the brush and disappearing under ground.
scene_heading: 49	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY
text: First ONE comes....then TWO MORE....THREE MORE. ZOMBIES are shuffling
text: out of the jungle and converging on the platoon.
text: They seem to come from everywhere. Soon there are twenty or more.
text: Most are tattered and ragged but others wear vests, the same type as
text: worn by the platoon. These are solid colours, some white, some blue.
text: None are red and none have orange circles.
text: As THE ZOMBIES push in closer they seem to get agitated. They start
text: growling and reaching out. THE MEN WITH THE CATTLE PRODS poke at the
text: more unruly creatures and ZAPPING SOUNDS can be heard.
text: The creatures form a kind of ragged queue, lining up in front of the
dialog: "Good Humour" men. From inside their freezer cartons those men
text: produce GREAT BLOODY CHUNKS OF RAW MEAT. THE ZOMBIES docilely take
text: the hand-outs and go lurching out of the queue, some starting to eat
text: immediately, others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a
dialog: more private supper.
scene_heading: 50	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What is that? Could that be....?
text: Behind her, CHICO gets the dry heaves. He slams his hand into his
dialog: mouth to keep from making noise.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. They must have gotten them to
dialog: accept....other things. They wouldn't be
dialog: feeding them with....they wouldn't...
scene_heading: 51	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY
text: The man in command of the platoon is obvious, strutting around while
dialog: others do the dirty work. This is CAPTAIN RHODES. He's
text: conscienceless, the low of the low, and a weasely-looking guy, to
text: boot. He watches the operation almost hoping for trouble. (He loves
dialog: to torture disobedient zombies.)
text: Behind him, their AUTOMATICS ready, are SEVERAL TROOPERS especially
text: assigned to protect the captain. One of these troopers is TOBY TYLER,
text: a good guy. TOBY is revulsed by the scene in the clearing. He drops
text: his head, almost gagging. RHODES notices.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: You'll get used to this, Tyler. It's the
dialog: only way. They don't bite the hand that
dialog: feeds.
dialog: 
text: TOBY looks up. He can't conceal his contempt for the captain. RHODES
text: reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a SOUND
text: distracts him.
text: ONE OF THE RAG-TAG ZOMBIES is running amok. THE ZAPPERS poke at the
dialog: creature but that just makes it angrier.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: GET THAT THING AWAY FROM THE OTHERS!
dialog: BRING IT HERE!
text: ONE TROOPER has A LONG POLE WITH A WIRE NOOSE ON THE END. He drops
text: the noose over the wild zombie's head and the wire tightens, biting
text: into the dead flesh on the thing's neck. The pole is long enough to
text: control the creature while keeping it out of reach.
scene_heading: 52	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: SARAH watches, repulsed but fascinated. CHICO is still fighting the
text: heaves. Without warning, A ZOMBIE looms up directly behind CHICO. The
text: man jumps forward, terrified. He crashes into SARAH who spins and
dialog: sees the danger.
text: TWO MORE ZOMBIES appear. Then A THIRD. These have no vests. They're
text: rag-tag, bad ass and hungry as hell. ONE OF THEM grabs SARAH. She
text: manages to pull away but behind her CHICO panics. He raises his RIFLE
dialog: and...RATTATATTATATT!
scene_heading: 53	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY
text: RHODES hears the GUNFIRE. He seems pleased. He grins.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: We have visitors. Let's go men.
text: He moves slowly towards the thicket followed by TOBY TYLER AND
text: SEVERAL OTHER SOLDIERS. He reaches down to his belt and pushes one of
text: THREE BUTTONS on A UNIT that resembles a pager. ELECTRONIC BEEPS,
dialog: like the ones we heard earlier, come from the unit, this time in a
dialog: different pattern.
text: THE RED COAT ZOMBIES respond quickly. They draw their PISTOLS and go
text: marching off after their leader, grunting and snorting like bull
text: apes. RHODES' grin breaks into a wide-open laugh.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Hah! If only the rest of you ladies would
dialog: obey orders the way they do.
scene_heading: 54	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: Their cover blown, SARAH now raises her RIFLE. BUDDABUDDA!!!
text: THE SECOND ZOMBIE'S HEAD TURNS TO RED PULP and the thing pitches
dialog: forward, dead.
text: CHICO FIRES and THE THIRD ZOMBIE IS DESTROYED.
text: Suddenly there is DISTANT FIRE, from the clearing. BULLETS WHIZ
text: through the brush. The guerilleros duck for cover.
scene_heading: 55	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY
text: THE RED COAT ZOMBIES, shuffling forward abreast in a line, have
text: OPENED FIRE. It's a grisly parody of foot-soldiering. The creatures
text: are unsteady on their feet, their hands shake when they squeeze the
dialog: stiff Army-issue triggers. BULLETS FLY this way and that, most of
text: them grossly off target.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: THAT'S IT, YOU WORM-EATEN SLIME ! YOU FOUL-
dialog: SMELLING, PUSS-FACED MAGGOTS! I TOLD YOU
dialog: I'D FIND YOU REAL ACTION, DIDN'T I? YOU
dialog: CORRUPTION! YOU FILTH! YOU'RE LEARNING!
dialog: YOU'RE GETTING BETTER....GETTING
dialog: BETTER...GETTING BETTER, YOU SCUM!
text: The trooper beside TOBY is another young man whose nickname is
text: TRICKS. He and TOBY exchange glances as they trudge along behind the
text: captain and his zombie red coats. Their eyes tell us that they both
dialog: think Rhodes to be insane, which of course he is.
scene_heading: 56	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: SARAH moves to retreat but CHICO lifts his rifle and FIRES wildly
text: into the clearing.
speaker_heading: CHICO
text: NO! NOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
scene_heading: 57	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY
text: TWO OF THE RED COATS ARE HIT, but not in the head. Their brains keep
text: functioning and they march on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: SPREAD OUT, MEN! OPEN FIRE!
text: Whatever else he is, RHODES seems fearless. He stands in the open as
text: his human soldiers fan out. He notices that the RED COATS are out of
text: ammunition. He pushes another button on his belt unit and MORE BEEPS
text: SOUND. THE RED COATS stop in their tracks. They dump the SPENT SHELLS
text: from their weapons and reload using fresh rounds from their belts.
text: Their fingers are stiff. Three bullets fall to the ground for every
text: one that finds its way into a gun chamber.
text: The SOLDIERS HAVE OPENED FIRE NOW. They are closing in on the
dialog: thicket.
scene_heading: 58	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: CHICO IS HIT high on the right side of his chest. SARAH FIRES A QUICK
text: BURST out into the clearing as she tries to pull the man deeper into
dialog: the jungle.
text: Suddenly, from right behind SARAH's back, comes A BLOOD CURDLING
text: SCREAM. A DARK FIGURE LOOMS UP startling us all.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: BURN THE CHURCH! KILL THE PRIEST!
text: It's MIGUEL, sweating, his eyes sunken into deep black sockets. He is
text: charging toward the clearing with his AUTOMATIC BLAZING in his one
text: good hand. He thunders right past SARAH almost knocking her down.
scene_heading: 59	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY
text: MIGUEL breaks out of the thicket into clear view of the SOLDIERS.
text: RHODES sees the one-armed wild man and his grin dissipated slightly.
text: He draws his own PISTOL, an enormous Magnum, an elephant stopper.
text: SOLDIERS, taken by surprise, scatter, TOBY AND TRICKS among them.
text: MIGUEL'S BULLETS DRAW A LINE ACROSS ONE SOLDIER'S CHEST. He dies
dialog: instantly.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: KILL THE PRIEST! BURN THE CHURCH!
text: BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN!
text: NOW MIGUEL IS HIT but he keeps coming, his GUN SPITTING.
text: ANOTHER SOLDIER goes down, HIT IN THE MID SECTION.
text: THE PLATOON RETURNS FIRE.
text: MIGUEL IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE CHEST. He falls to his knees. His RIFLE
text: FIRES A LINE OF BULLETS INTO THE EARTH and the kicking of the gun
text: knocks him back on his ass. He sits there bewildered for a moment,
text: then he looks up to find himself directly facing CAPTAIN RHODES.
text: RHODES lifts his MAGNUM but MIGUEL is faster with his RIFLE. In the
text: next instant the muzzle is aiming straight for the captain's stomach.
text: RHODES' smile disappears, re-placed by a sudden flush of fear. He
dialog: freezes.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Kill the priest.
text: MIGUEL squeezes the trigger and his weapon CLICKS sharply. It's
dialog: empty.
text: The captain's smile slowly returns. He pushes the "Attack" button on
dialog: his belt unit.
text: THE RED COATS advance, their PISTOLS reloaded. THEY FIRE, stiff-armed
text: and fumble-fingered, at MIGUEL. He sees them moving towards him.
text: Something in his mind clicks and he recognises the creatures for what
dialog: they are...walking dead.
text: THE FIRST FEW BULLETS MISS. Then ONE HITS HIM IN HIS STUMP and
text: reality gets even clearer. He starts to scream.
text: THE READ COATS walk closer, their dead eyes showing enjoyment of the
dialog: sport. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
text: ANOTHER ROUND HITS MIGUEL IN THE STOMACH. ANOTHER CREASES HIS HEAD.
text: He tries to stand up but he's too weak. A BULLET IN THE NECK stops
text: his screaming. Then HE'S HIT IN THE HEART. A BALL OF BLOOD PROJECTS
text: OUT OF HIS MOUTH and he plops onto his back, dead.
text: THE READ COATS KEEP FIRING until their guns are empty again. RHODES
text: calmly pushes the "Reload" signal and the creatures obey.
text: MIGUEL'S CORPSE twitches for a short time, then goes rigid.
scene_heading: 60	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: SARAH sinks against a cypress when she sees MIGUEL die.
text: CHICO, in a state of blind panic, takes off along the edge of the
text: thicket, his WOUND BLEEDING PROFUSELY.
scene_heading: 61	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: CHICO breaks through some brush to find himself face-to-face with
text: TOBY TYLER'S GROUP OF SOLDIERS. He stops, reverses course, and ducks
text: into a cluster of palms. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS FIRES.
dialog: RATTATATTATATTATATT!!!
text: BULLETS RIP THE PALM FRONDS APART. There's a scream and CHICO
text: somersaults out into view. NEW WOUNDS BLEEDING ACROSS THE CENTER OF
speaker_heading: HIS CHEST.
scene_heading: 62	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: SARAH realises that this is her last chance to escape. She takes
text: advantage of the confusion and the NOISE and bolts into the jungle at
dialog: a full run.
scene_heading: 63	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: CHICO is still alive. He fumbles for his HOLSTERED PISTOL but before
text: he can draw it THREE TROOPERS are on top of him. TRICKS tromps a boot
text: on his hand. TOBY TYLER aims his RIFLE squarely at his sweating brow.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: Yes...yes, do it...please...you can't let
dialog: me die this way...please. Destroy me. A
dialog: bullet...in the head...I don't want to
dialog: become...one of...one of them.
text: TOBY looks down at the man, at his TERRIBLE WOUNDS, clearly fatal
text: ones. TOBY clicks a shell into the firing chamber of his RIFLE. His
text: finger is just sliding under the trigger shield when CAPTAIN RHODES
text: strides up behind him.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Take his weapon, Tyler.
text: TOBY is startled by the voice at his back. He turns towards the
text: captain, then he looks back down at the guerillero, hesitating..
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Take his gun, ass hole. He still has the
dialog: strength to pull a trigger.
text: Reluctantly TOBY obeys, reaches down for CHICO'S PISTOL.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: Please...senor...destroy me...one
dialog: bullet...please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Maybe. We'll have a little talk first.
dialog: Then....maybe...I can help you out. String
dialog: him up.
text: THE THIRD SOLDIER reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under
text: the arms. TRICKS stoops to help. CHICO screams in agony when he is
text: moved. TOBY lunges in to help the others, thinking to ease the man's
dialog: pain.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: They can handle it, Tyler. You've been
dialog: buckin' for a shit detail lately so here's
dialog: one you're gonna love. We've got two dead.
dialog: Cut the heads off and get the bodies
text: underground to the refrigerators. Fast.
dialog: It's a hot day.
text: TOBY grimaces but doesn't speak. He turns and moves briskly towards
text: the clearing. RHODES watches him go.
scene_heading: 64	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY
text: TOBY nears the spot where MIGUEL lies sprawled in A POOL OF BLOOD.
text: RHODES calls from the edge of the thicket.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Tyler. Just our men. Not him.
text: TOBY looks down at the remains of the one-armed guerillero.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: His head stays where it is. He and I never
dialog: really had the chance to get acquainted.
dialog: When he comes back...I'll get another shot
dialog: at it... Ha ha ha ha...
scene_heading: 65	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY
text: CLOSE ON CHICO. He's dangling from A ROPE which is tied over a tall
text: tree, his feet ten feet off the ground.
dialog: ZOMBIES wander here and there. They've all received their rations.
text: The picnic is breaking up now. Occasionally one of them gets surly
text: but it doesn't amount to anything. SOLDIERS stand ready with ELECTRIC
text: PRODS, OTHERS with GUNS.
text: PARAPHERNALIA is being packed away. MEN CARRY EQUIPMENT in the
dialog: direction of the elevator.
text: RHODES walks up beneath where CHICO is hanging. He's careful not to
text: step in too close. He doesn't want to get any DRIPPING BLOOD on his
dialog: uniform.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: Please....shoot me.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back
dialog: after your death. You'll come back and find
dialog: yourself hanging there...wanting to
dialog: eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate
dialog: that thought, don't you? That's the
dialog: ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't
dialog: it?
text: CHICO is weeping now. With a found spurt of energy he struggles
dialog: against the rope. No use. It only brings pain.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: After hanging up there a few days you will
dialog: be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for
dialog: it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME!
text: SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: I'll bargain with you. How many of you are
dialog: on the island?
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: Two of us...only two of us...me...and him.
text: (He nods towards MIGUEL'S CORPSE.)
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your
dialog: headquarters? On the mainland?
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: The mainland...is dead...a dead
dialog: place...nobody there...
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me
dialog: or I'll let you hang there
dialog: forever...FOREVER!
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: There are no...headquarters. There are
dialog: no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't
dialog: you see. They have won.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Then why did you come here?
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: To look...look for a place...a place to
dialog: live in...an empty place...a...
dialog: new...place...
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: How did you know we were on this island? Do
dialog: others know? Will others come?
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: Nooooo. Believe me. There are no
dialog: others...no rebels...nobody...it's
dialog: over...it's ooooo....
text: The man collapses, unconscious.
scene_heading: 66	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY
text: CLOSE ON THE DISEMBODIED HEAD OF ONE OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS. TRICKS is
text: dropping the thing into A LARGE PLASTIC BAG which obviously already
text: contains THE SECOND HEAD. TOBY wraps the mouth of the bag and begins
text: to walk off. RHODES stops him.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Where are you going, Tyler?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the
dialog: heads.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: No time for that. I'll take care of them.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Just....following procedure, sir. They're
dialog: entitled to burial.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave
dialog: them there. Go help with the rest of the
dialog: gear.
dialog: RHODES has it in for TOBY (we'll find out why later), and of course
text: the feeling is mutual. TOBY sets the bag down on the ground and,
text: seething, he trots off towards the rest of the platoon. TRICKS
dialog: follows.
text: After a moment, RHODES motions with his head. THE SOLDIER WITH THE
text: LONG NOOSE POLE steps into view with the CAPTIVE ZOMBIE, the one that
text: ran amok earlier. The man follows RHODES towards the jungle, dragging
text: the gurgling creature along, the wire noose digging into the thing's
dialog: neck.
scene_heading: 67	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: CLOSE: as RHODES' GLOVED HAND jams A HAND GRENADE into THE CAPTIVE
text: ZOMBIE'S gaping mouth. THE SOLDIER WITH THE POLE releases the noose
text: and the two men take off, running.
scene_heading: 68	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY
text: They run to the middle of the clearing where they turn around to
text: watch. RHODES lifts A PAIR OF BINOCULARS that are strapped around his
text: neck. He stares through the lenses, focusing, grinning.
scene_heading: 69	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: THROUGH THE BINOCULARS: We see THE ZOMBIE staggering in the bush,
text: clawing desperately at the thing jammed in its mouth.
scene_heading: 70	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY
text: TOBY AND TRICKS are the only ones who seem to notice what RHODES has
text: done. TOBY drops THE CRATE he was going to carry off. He stares in
text: disbelief, hatred on his face.
scene_heading: 71	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
text: WIDE SHOT as THE HEAD OF THE ZOMBIE DISINTEGRATES WHEN THE GRENADE
speaker_heading: EXPLODES.
scene_heading: 72	EXT.	THE CLEARING - DAY
text: RHODES grins as he watches the spectacle.
text: Suddenly, A LOUD GUNSHOT startles the captain. He drops the
text: binoculars and spins around. He sees...
text: ...CHICO'S BODY DANGLING ON THE ROPE. CHICO'S HEAD IS BLOODY. He's
text: dead...and won't come back to life. He's been shot through the brain.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: WHO FIRED THAT SHOT? WHO FIRED THAT SHOT?
text: SOLDIERS stand around dumbly. Those with RIFLES in their hands
text: quickly sling them onto their shoulders. They're all afraid of the
text: captain's wrath. RHODES walks towards the line of men with fury in
dialog: his eyes.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Goddammit, somebody's gonna tell me who
dialog: fired that shot or I'll have every last one
dialog: of you chopped up for feed!!!
text: His eyes spot TOBY, standing behind the crate he dropped earlier, his
dialog: rifle slung.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Step up here, Tyler.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Sir!
text: TOBY shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps
text: forward. RHODES stares him down, his anger turning sinister.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: You fired that shot, didn't you?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Let me see your weapon.
text: TOBY hands over his rifle. RHODES feels the barrel, sniffs it.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: It's been fired.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: In the battle, sir.
dialog: RHODES is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out
text: to be his favourite whipping boy. His body relaxes visibly.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: It may be that none of these chicken-shits
dialog: will talk while the whole troop is
dialog: present...but I know some of these men
dialog: well. I'm sure that a few private
dialog: conversations will tell me what I already
dialog: know. You may have earned yourself some
dialog: time in the Stalag, Tyler.
text: (Rhodes glances over at CHICO'S body)
dialog: Cut him down. That's another head for you
dialog: to chop off. Leave it with the others. Take
text: the rest of his body down to the freezers.
dialog: Move it, shit hill.
text: TOBY moves off. RHODES' grin returns.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 73	INT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING
text: There's that GIANT SOUND again, the RUMBLE OF THE ELEVATOR. We're
text: inside the place called THE CAVE, in a huge under-ground concrete
text: bunker. TECHNICIANS AND ARMED GUARDS bustle around. Enormous
text: hydraulic pistons are bringing the camouflaged iron plate down from
text: the surface. Riding on board, RHODES AND HIS PLATOON prepare to
dialog: unload their paraphernalia.
scene_heading: 74	EXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING
text: SARAH, sweating, exhausted, BLEEDING FROM CUTS made by jungle
text: branches, wrings out a piece of cloth torn from her sleeve. She has
text: dipped it into a jungle stream. Cautiously she tastes the water,
text: decides to chance it and squeezes the cloth into her mouth.
text: The NIGHT BIRDS suddenly stop their singing and the quiet makes SARAH
text: look up. Standing across the stream, only ten feet away, is A
text: PARTICULARLY GROTESQUE ZOMBIE. VULTURES stand on the marshy ground
text: beside the creature's legs, THEIR SHARP BEAKS PICKING BLOODY HOLES IN
text: ITS ANKLES AND FEET.
text: SARAH jumps to her feet, fighting back exhaustion one more time. She
text: unslings her RIFLE, aims it, then thinks better of firing. Grabbing
text: up her SUPPLY PACK she runs into the darkening jungle.
scene_heading: 75	EXT.	THE JUNGLE - EVENING
text: WHAM! TWO BIG HANDS GRAB SARAH by her shoulders. She starts to scream
text: but one of those hands shoots up to cover her mouth.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's alright. It's alright. Don't be
dialog: afraid. We're friends.
text: SARAH looks into the strong, good face of JOHN, a tall muscular man,
text: a Caribbean Islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes
dialog: that seem instantly trustworthy.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: There are soldiers near here. Guards. I'll
dialog: take my hand away if you won't scream.
text: SARAH nods and JOHN lets her go. There are two other humans standing
text: behind the big man. There's BILL McDERMOTT, wearing the grease-
text: covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy
text: from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face
text: who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth. She's a deaf
text: mute, nicknamed SPIDER, and she is urgently signing "Come on! Let's
dialog: get outa here!" with her hands.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Right. We better get away from that Bee. He
dialog: might have friends.
text: THE GROUP starts moving. SARAH follows voluntarily. We notice that
text: all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw
text: on the foot soldiers, the ones with big orange circles.
scene_heading: 76	EXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING
text: THE GROUP trudges through thick brushland, occasionally needing to
text: chop a path with their blades. JOHN speaks in low tones as they move.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Bees. That's what we call the dead... the
dialog: walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Gasparilla?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He was a pirate who sailed these waters
dialog: long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these
dialog: days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That's the man. He's been holed up here
dialog: ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and
dialog: his family owned these islands 'round here.
dialog: They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The
text: whole underneath is dug out. There was
dialog: missiles here and laboratories and bomb
dialog: proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that.
dialog: Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's...
dialog: private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his
dialog: cronies from all the best golf courses in
dialog: Tallahassee...and his private army, of
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: We ran up against a platoon of soldiers.
dialog: There were actually walking dead...in
dialog: uniform...with guns.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They
dialog: could sting, sister. We know you came up
dialog: against 'em. We been watchin' you since you
dialog: landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that.
dialog: We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was
dialog: spotted it could....well, it could be the
dialog: end of everything.
text: SPIDER is signing for everyone to be quiet. They all stop in their
text: tracks. BILL McDERMOTT swigs some more brandy. With the stealth of a
text: Mohican SPIDER pushes aside the branches of a giant oleander and
dialog: peers through.
scene_heading: 77	EXT. ENTRANCE TWO - EVENING
text: There's A HATCHWAY in sight built into A CONCRETE, BUNKER LIKE
text: STRUCTURE. FOUR OR FIVE SOLDIERS are coming up out of the ground.
text: They're armed with PRODS AND RIFLES.
text: Behind the men, lurching on unsteady feet, come A HALF-DOZEN OF THE
text: LIVING DEAD, all wearing vests of white and blue.
text: Behind the lumbering creatures come A WOMAN AND A MAN both wearing
text: white laboratory coats and carrying clipboards. The woman is MARY
dialog: HENRIED, one of the top behaviouralists in The Cave. (We'll learn a
dialog: lot more about her later.)
text: THE ZOMBIES are pushing through the undergrowth right in the
text: direction of SARAH and her friends. SARAH shows some alarm at this
text: but JOHN calms her with a strong hand.
text: SPIDER has seen the approaching danger. She silently draws A FARMER'S
text: SICKLE from her belt. (With her other hand she draws A PISTOL for
text: good measure.) BILL McDERMOTT unarmed, nervously takes another
text: swallow from his flask.
text: THE ZOMBIES are getting closer. Too close for comfort.
text: Finally, MARY HENRIED and THE OTHERS turn and disappear into the
text: bunker. The last man down pulls the hatch shut.
text: The moment the coast is clear, SPIDER AND JOHN jump up from cover.
text: THE OTHERS follow their lead. But it's too late. THE ZOMBIES have
text: spotted them. The creatures begin to growl and make AGITATED, APE-
text: LIKE SOUNDS. SPIDER brings her BLADE up chest-high, ready to repel an
text: attack. SARAH lifts her own MACHETE but JOHN reaches over and takes
text: it away from her.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Give that to me. Get behind me. Stay behind
dialog: me.
dialog: (SARAH resists, not understanding, somewhat
dialog: insulted.)
dialog: You ain't wearin' a vest. They been taught
dialog: not to touch the ones with the circles.
dialog: There ain't no hundred percent, all-a-time
dialog: rules with the Bees, but most-a-time they
dialog: leave us alone. The colour on their vests
dialog: tell ya how much schoolin' they got. It's
dialog: the ones without colours you gotta watch
dialog: out for.
text: SARAH gets behind JOHN, his orange circle acting as her shield. He
text: reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his
dialog: back.
text: THE ZOMBIES, snarling and showing teeth, move through the thicket.
text: ONE shuffles right past SPIDER AND McDERMOTT. It gets stuck in the
text: bramble, changes course and moves on without attacking.
text: ANOTHER ZOMBIE, a "white", trudges within arm's reach of JOHN,
text: growling all the while. Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes
text: two angry steps towards the humans who back away.
text: THE ZOMBIES charges. Things happen quickly. JOHN pushes SARAH away
text: and swings the MACHETE. THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE CREATURES SKULL.
text: BLACKENED BLOOD FLIES. An instant later SPIDER'S SICKLE PUNCHES IN
text: BESIDE THE BIG KNIFE. THE ZOMBIE twitches for a moment, its eyes
text: rolling, then it falls, lifeless, to the ground.
text: McDERMOTT trots up beside SARAH. He takes a huge swallow from his
text: flask then offers some to her. She puts the flask to her lips but
text: nothing comes. She holds it out, neck down, to show that it's empty.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Sorry. Guess I don't know my own strength.
text: JOHN wipes SARAH'S MACHETE on some thick leaves, cleaning off most of
text: the gore, then he returns the weapon to the woman.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I know you can. Like I said, we been
dialog: watchin' you.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: We better get as far away from here as we
dialog: can. We can work the other side of the
dialog: island tonight.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (explaining) We found nine entrances to the
dialog: Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole
dialog: thing near charted yet. That's what we was
dialog: doin' out here today. Huntin' for
dialog: entrances.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Come on. They find a Bee done like this and
dialog: they'll know somebody's been out walkin'
dialog: where they shouldn't have been.
text: JOHN bows his head over the downed ZOMBIE. He mumbles softly. We
text: can't hear the words but we can tell that he's praying, reciting the
text: good words over the corpse of the "white-coat".
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: The man I was with...until today...
dialog: believed that praying was for blind men who
dialog: couldn't see the truth.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: How we gonna break the curse without a
dialog: prayer or two.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Curse?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What is it if it ain't a curse?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite
dialog: that infects the brain.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That sounds like a curse to me.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We thought we were escaping here. We
dialog: thought we'd found an uninhabited island.
dialog: Christ! This place is a worse nightmare
dialog: than anything I've seen yet!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why
dialog: we're doin' what we're doin'. What's
dialog: happenin' underground here is just what
dialog: Lucifer planned for this sinful race o'
dialog: man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're
dialog: gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus
dialog: nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a
dialog: bullet from one of those storm troopers and
dialog: prayer won't keep one of those monsters
dialog: from eatin' your liver for lunch.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That's why we didn't use prayers on this
dialog: here white coat 'til after he was
dialog: destroyed. We ready to fight when we have
dialog: to. And we gotta fight now.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been
dialog: fightin' for what feels like a hundred
dialog: years and I'm finished. I don't need
dialog: religion. I don't need prayers. I need a
dialog: couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail
dialog: on outa here. Find another island where
dialog: there ain't so much....traffic.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You think you can find your boat? There's a
dialog: thousand little inlets and backwaters all
dialog: through here. You remember all the ways you
dialog: turned to get where you are now? You leave
dialog: yourself a trail?
text: SARAH is stopped by this. She stares at the big man suspiciously, not
dialog: sure whether to believe him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We didn't see the exact spot but we know
dialog: about where you landed. But we ain't ready
dialog: to take you there. Not yet. You see...we
dialog: need guns, too.
text: SARAH looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas. She thinks
text: for a moment...not very long...then she turns and starts off into the
dialog: jungle.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I can find it myself. I didn't come that
dialog: far.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Farther than you think. You'll get lost.
dialog: You will. And there's Bees all through the
dialog: jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos
dialog: don't lie.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. They just try to hold you for ransom.
dialog: Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
text: SARAH plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over
text: her shoulder she disappears.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: We can't let her go, John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We don't need her guns that bad. Billy boy.
dialog: (He's joking.)
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: The hell we don't! But that's not what I
dialog: mean. She'll be dead in ten minutes out
dialog: there alone. That or she'll be firin' off
text: her automatics and wakin' up the troops.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We'll split up. Billy, you go with Spider.
dialog: Just an hour or two tonight, that's all.
dialog: Rhodes might have extra guards on after all
dialog: the commotion. We'll meet up at number six
dialog: and go back home together.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: God save us. And me with me flask dry. I'll
dialog: never make it.
text: THE GROUP splits up, moving off in two different directions through
text: the darkening underbrush.
scene_heading: 78	EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - NIGHT
text: DARKNESS has fallen. The jungle is as black as the background on a
dialog: velvet painting.
text: SARAH is moving cautiously. She bumps into something, jumps back, her
text: MACHETE high, and freezes. Cautiously she moves ahead...one
dialog: step...another...another...
text: SPLASH!!! She steps down off a hidden ledge into A KNEE-DEEP RIVER.
text: She manages to keep her balance but her MACHETE falls into the water
text: and drops to the bottom invisible in the dark silt. Slowly she bends
text: down and reaches into the water. A SNAKE swims past just inches away.
text: SARAH recoils. Before she can reach down again she hears A LOUD,
text: ANIMAL SNORT followed by A GREAT SPLASHING SOUND. Then ANOTHER. She
text: squints to see.
text: SHAPES approach on the black water. ALLIGATORS, big ones, just their
text: very tops showing as they move on a straight course toward the woman.
text: She backs up feeling for the shore, for the ledge behind her. THE
text: FIRST ZOMBIE GRABS HER SHOULDERS. She spins and sees the thing. It
text: has one eye dangling out of its socket and there's a broken-off
text: length of wooden pole stuck clean through its torso just under the
dialog: left breast.
text: SARAH smashes her RIFLE BUTT INTO THE THING'S HEAD. AGAIN. AGAIN. It
dialog: keeps coming. (So do the gators. They're getting to within a few
text: yards.) SARAH swings a fourth time. THE ZOMBIE grabs her rifle. She
text: pulls with all her might and the creature, hanging on to the gun,
text: topples off the ledge and into the water.
text: When SARAH starts to climb up on the ledge, ANOTHER ZOMBIE lurches
text: towards her from dry land. She spins around, looking for options. The
text: gators are just about close enough to bite her ass and THE ZOMBIE
text: that fell into the river is rising up again, covered with moss and
text: slime and looking pissed.
text: SARAH faces THE ZOMBIE on the bank. She has no choice. She aims her
text: AUTOMATIC. She's just about to fire when SOMETHING FLASHES out of the
text: darkness. It's A MACHETE. IT CLEAVES OPEN THE ZOMBIE'S SKULL. From
text: out of the night big JOHN appears. He struggles to free his blade
text: from the dead creature's head.
text: SARAH scrambles up onto the muddy ledge. THE GATORS are still moving
text: in and THE ZOMBIE, its moss-covered arms reaching out rigidly like
text: the arms of Frankenstein's monster, is growling ferociously (almost
text: swallowing its own dangling eyeball in the process).
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Are you gonna pause to say words over the
dialog: dead this time or can we be on our way?
text: Without answering, JOHN steams off through the bush pulling SARAH
text: along behind him, his big hand tight around her arm.
scene_heading: 79	INT. THE CAVE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on: A TELEVISION SCREEN. First there is only VIDEO NOISE, then
text: an image blinks onto the screen.
text: MONTAGE: OTHER VIDEO SCREENS on MONITORS in various places throughout
text: the huge underground facility. ZOMBIES watch the screens gathered in
text: groups of four, six and eight, like children in ranked classes.
text: The screens show scenes of ZOMBIES taking FOOD from humans in ORANGE
text: CIRCLE VESTS. GUNS are pointed at ORANGE CIRCLES then lowered
text: harmlessly. GUNS are pointed at HUMANS without orange circles and
text: FIRED. The images repeat and repeat and repeat. THE ZOMBIES watch the
text: scenes with dumb curiosity.
scene_heading: 80	INT. COMMUNICATION CENTER IN THE CAVE - NIGHT
dialog: This is the central area for all varieties of communication. There
text: are RADIO CONSOLES, both intercom and outgoing, there are VIDEO
text: CONTROL PANELS and there are LARGE COMPUTER TERMINALS. Reflecting the
dialog: panic to set up operations back when the disaster first struck, much
text: of the equipment is placed haphazardly and not built in. WIRES run
text: every which way, BARE ANTENNAS AND LOOSE CONNECTORS clutter the
text: place. ENGINEERS scurry with TOOL BOXES constantly repairing,
dialog: patching, trouble shooting.
text: Most of the personnel are TECHNICIANS but there is a group of
text: SCIENTIFIC TYPES, obvious in their white lab coats. Among these is
text: MARY HENRIED, who we caught a glimpse of outside Entrance Two.
text: At A SECURITY STATION, A GUARD notices something on one of his own
text: VIDEO SCREENS which monitor key locations inside The Cave.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: There's activity in the dormitory!
text: MARY and one of her assistants, JULIE GRANT, a younger girl, move
text: over to the video console. ONE SCREEN there shows what looks like a
text: prison corridor. CELLS WITH HEAVILY BARRED DOORS run down both sides.
text: We can see the distinct MOVEMENT OF SHADOWS in the corridor. MARY
text: reacts instantly stepping over to AN INTERCOM and pressing A SEND-
speaker_heading: BUTTON.
speaker_heading: VOICE (o.s. - filter)
dialog: Gate twenty-three.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: This is Mary Henried. Did anyone enter the
dialog: dormitory?
speaker_heading: VOICE (o.s. - filter)
dialog: Yes, ma'm. Captain Rhodes.
text: MARY clicks off, infuriated. She hurries towards AN EXIT followed by
speaker_heading: JULIE GRANT.
scene_heading: 81	INT. THE DORMITORY IN THE CAVE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON: THE MOUTH OF A LARGE PLASTIC BAG. A HAND wearing A BLACK
text: LEATHER GLOVE pulls A HUMAN HEAD out of a bag by its hair. It's the
text: head of one of the dead soldiers from Rhode's platoon. The hand
dialog: belongs to RHODES himself.
text: In the darkness of A CELL, A RED COAT ZOMBIES takes a hesitant step
text: forward. RHODES tries to shove THE HEAD through the bars but IT
text: STICKS. When RHODES lets go it stays there, wedged at shoulder
dialog: height.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Take it, friend. Take it. It's a present.
dialog: From me to you.
text: THE RED COAT steps forward and lays its hand on THE HEAD.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Just remember who gives you favours.
text: THE ZOMBIE pulls hard and THE HEAD pops through onto its side of the
text: bars. The creature lurches off towards A COT in the shadows at the
text: rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to RAVISH THE HEAD,
text: TEARING FLESH OFF, EATING IT hungrily.
text: On the cell door we notice A PLAQUE with a number (5) and, written in
text: marker, the Red Coat's nickname, "BLUTO".
text: RHODES moves past OTHER CELLS, each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT.
text: GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows. TONTO stands near the bars,
text: growling. FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old
dialog: who needs to pee.
text: RHODES stops at A CELL marked "BUB!". Inside we see A SILHOUETTE,
text: tall, erect, not moving a muscle. RHODES grins.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Well, Bub. I've heard about you. Miss
dialog: Henried's pride and joy.
text: RHODES steps closer and BUB snarls warningly.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Surly sonofabitch. I want to make friends,
dialog: Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my
dialog: sack here.
text: A LOUD, CLANGING SOUND interrupts. RHODES turns to see.
scene_heading: 82	INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT
text: MARY HENRIED AND JULIE GRANT have entered through A STEEL DOOR WITH
text: ELECTRONIC LOCKS. THE ZOMBIES send up A CHORUS OF MOANS AND GROWLS.
text: The women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass.
text: Suddenly they stop in their tracks, their horrified eyes staring into
text: A CELL marked "SAMSON!".
text: SAMSON is nibbling on ANOTHER HEAD. Much of the flesh is already
dialog: gone, but we can still recognise...CHICO. The zombie turns the thing
text: up-side-down, reaches way inside, through the neck, and pulls out
dialog: grey matter.
text: JULIE backs away, fighting nausea. A spasm rises in MARY'S stomach as
text: well and she reels away from the hideous sight.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: God....damn you, Rhodes!
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: God has damned us all. Are my atrocities
dialog: worse than yours?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You have ruined weeks of work here! We've
dialog: been trying to wean these specimens onto
dialog: alligator meat!
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: No wonder they're so....hungry.
text: Suddenly JULIE SCREAMS, her hands flying to her mouth.
text: THE PLASTIC BAG is still dangling from RHODES' GLOVED HAND. Inside,
text: pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of THE
text: FINAL HEAD. THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing the whole bag to wiggle.
text: RHODES drops the bag instantly to the floor. Taking care, he grabs
text: the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard. THE HEAD ROLLS OUT
text: AND SETTLES AGAINST A WALL. IT'S EYES ARE OPEN AND DARTING CRAZILY,
text: ITS MOUTH IS CHEWING, GROTESQUELY, ON THE AIR.
text: MARY stares in shock. JULIE runs towards the exit, trying to scream
text: but gagging on her own acids. She's hysterical.
text: RHODES calmly draws his PISTOL, cocks, and FIRES. THE SQUIRMING HEAD
text: IS SHATTERED by the powerful bullet.
scene_heading: 83	INT. MARY'S OFFICE IN THE CAVE - NIGHT
text: A 9 BY 12 CUBICLE with A SMALL COMPUTER TERMINAL, A DESK AND THREE
text: CHAIRS. There's A LIGHTBOX on the wall displaying GROUPS OF CRANIAL
speaker_heading: X-RAYS.
text: MARY guides JULIE GRANT into a chair. RHODES stands cockily in the
text: open doorway.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I
dialog: didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Any dead whose brains are intact will
dialog: revive.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must
dialog: be torture for them!
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: They are brutes without feeling. Though I
dialog: admit that I've requested cremation for
dialog: myself. Burial is an archaic tradition,
dialog: even more ridiculous now than it ever was.
dialog: To say nothing of the...spacing
dialog: problem...on a small island like this.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I thought the purpose of decapitation was
dialog: to...to...
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: The purpose of decapitation is to preserve
dialog: as much...food...as possible. The purpose
dialog: for feeding is to keep the beasts on our
dialog: side. The fact that they can be taught to
dialog: clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a
dialog: convenient side benefit, not the primary
dialog: goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves
dialog: from becoming their supper. Keep them fed
dialog: and they behave. Keep them hungry and they
dialog: revert back to being the animals that they
dialog: have always been. You saw them in there.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: They will never be satisfied with anything
dialog: else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh.
dialog: I'm prepared to take whatever steps are
dialog: necessary to see to it they don't get mine!
dialog: Not while I'm still using it!
text: JULIE has calmed herself down. Now she feels angry, betrayed. She
text: looks at MARY accusingly.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Did you know? About the de-caps?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'd never seen it before.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: But you knew.
text: MARY nods in the affirmative. Tears form in JULIE'S eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What else is there, doctor? What else do
dialog: you people know that the rest of us don't?
text: They stare at one another. Whatever bond once existed between them
dialog: has been severed forever.
scene_heading: 84	INT. A CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - NIGHT
scene_heading: There are CARDIOGRAPHS, E.E.G. MONITORS, AND ALL SORT OF PHYSICAL
text: CONDITIONING DEVICES. On TABLES lie SYMBOLOGY CARDS AND COLOURED
text: BLOCKS for dexterity testing. There are LARGE CUT-OUT SHAPES on the
text: walls, TRIANGLES, SQUARES and familiar ORANGE CIRCLES.
text: MARY storms into the room flinging the door shut behind her. RHODES
text: catches it with his BLACK LEATHER GESTAPO BOOT.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: You can't run away from the planet, Miss
dialog: Science. You can't even run away from the
dialog: island, heh heh.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
text: RHODES laughs loudly. MARY faces him, hatred boiling away her
dialog: vocabulary. She can't think of word that are adequate.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You're....you're disgusting!
dialog: You're....FILTH!
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: And you're the one who builds the bomb and
dialog: they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be
dialog: used'.
text: MARY is stopped...by her own guilt. She turns and busies herself
text: gathering books and papers, then she CLICKS OFF A LIGHT and moves
text: toward the doorway where RHODES stands.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (calmer, with method) Julie Grant is a
dialog: behaviouralist. She's not medical. She
dialog: hasn't been as...exposed to...to
dialog: things...as some of the rest of us. She'll
dialog: be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be
dialog: alright.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Oh, I have no doubt.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (recognising threat in his voice) If you
dialog: put her on the shit list because of her
dialog: reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to
dialog: favour you lately. I understand he assigned
dialog: you a roommate of your choice. The rest of
dialog: us have to pick names out of a hat.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (reading his jealousy) Rhodes, you and I
dialog: had a roll in the hay together when I first
dialog: got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying
dialog: experience which I do not want to, and
dialog: which I never will repeat! So give up,
dialog: mister! I'm going home...to that roommate
dialog: you mentioned.
text: MARY pushes past RHODES into the hallway.
scene_heading: 85	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE CONDITIONING ROOM - NIGHT
text: MARY starts down the hall but RHODES grabs her from behind. He leans
text: in close, lusting, pressing his lips against the back of her neck.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Take your hands off me! Right now!
text: An evil grin returns to RHODES' flushed face. He stares at the woman
text: for a long moment, then he lets go. MARY walks away, bristling.
text: RHODES calls after her.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Maybe you'll change your mind when it
dialog: starts getting too lonely for you.
text: MARY stops dead. She turns back to see him gloating.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: I'm not entirely without influence myself,
dialog: Miss Science. I had your roommate
dialog: assigned...by Gasparilla... to my platoon.
dialog: What's his name? Tyler? Yes. Toby Tyler.
text: A bubble of fear pushes up in MARY'S throat but she is only letting
text: her anger show. Her stare is fierce, her eyes daggers.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: I had an unfortunate little run-in with him
dialog: today. In fact...you might say that Mr.
dialog: Tyler is in big trouble with
dialog: the...authorities.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd
dialog: love to serve your balls to those Red Coats
dialog: for lunch! Think about it!
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs
dialog: to do some thinking.
text: He turns and walks away. MARY stands still for a time, THE SOUND OF
text: RHODES' CLICKING BOOTHEELS surrounding her, swallowing her. In the
text: DEEP BACKGROUND we can HEAR THE MOANS OF THE CAGED DEAD.
scene_heading: 86	INT. THE CENTRAL CHAMBERS OF THE CAVE - NIGHT
text: MONTAGE: as MARY walks through HUGE OPEN AREAS CARVED OUT OF NATURAL
text: ROCK. We are stunned at the enormity of the place. JEEPS AND TRUCKS
text: RUMBLE back and forth. Storage areas hold MOUNTAINS OF CRATES,
text: CARTONS, WATER AND GAS CANISTERS. FORK LIFTS shift loads from here to
dialog: there.
text: MARY comes to a place where the natural rock surrenders to man-made
text: walls. She enters past TWO SECURITY GUARDS, showing her I.D.
scene_heading: 87	INT. THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT
text: MARY moves down A CORRIDOR with NUMBERED DOORS on both sides. We HEAR
text: THE SOUND OF LIFE, MUSIC BLASTING, VOICES LAUGHING, ARGUING, CRYING.
text: PEOPLE move by. A MAN AND A WOMAN are fighting. She slaps him, he
text: punches her, she kicks him in the balls. THREE HOOKERS pound on a
text: door. The door is opened by A NAKED MAN WEARING A DILDO on his nose.
text: OTHER MEN, behind him, laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke-
dialog: filled room.
text: MARY stops in her tracks when she sees that outside A DOOR NUMBERED
text: 83 (the door to her quarters) there are TWO OF RHODES' SOLDIERS with
text: RIFLES in hand. The door itself is open and SHADOWS move inside.
text: MARY turns quickly, before she is spotted, and starts back through
text: the hallway. As she turns a corner she is grabbed by TOBY TYLER.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find
dialog: out what's goin' on.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Hey. Slow down. What is it?
speaker_heading: MARY
text: Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his
dialog: move so fast.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's because of me.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is
dialog: a prick.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I want you to leave. Then maybe...
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We're both gonna leave. Leave the island.
dialog: I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we
dialog: can smuggle out one of those inflatable
text: rafts. They're crated up real small.
dialog: They've got air canisters. There's food
text: inside. Even a little motor.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm
dialog: not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong
dialog: that way. I need...
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Need what? Civilised order like we have
dialog: down here? Christ!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I can work here. Maybe my work can
dialog: help...help everyone. I can do more good
dialog: with access to this equipment than I can
text: off in some wasteland.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: For the good of mankind. That's what every
dialog: monster-maker says.
text: MARY looks into TOBY'S eyes. She's hurt, yet angry. The kind of anger
text: that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive
dialog: guilt-nerve.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We're gettin' out. Me and Tricks. I want
dialog: you to come with us. I want that more than
dialog: anything. I'll send word. I'll let you know
dialog: a time and a place to meet. We probably
dialog: won't be able to wait around so if you're
dialog: not there on the dot...well...if you're not
dialog: there, I'll know you're not comin'.
text: She grabs him, holding him tightly against her. They kiss, hard and
text: long. TOBY pulls away, looks at her lovingly, then turns and starts
text: toward the guarded apartment. MARY follows.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: (walking) I don't know what they're gonna
dialog: do to me. I figure they'll just send me out
dialog: to Stalag Seventeen but if...if it's worse
dialog: than that...Tricks will know. Stay in touch
dialog: with Tricks.
text: As they approach the door to number 83, THE SOLDIERS there raise
dialog: their RIFLE to ready positions.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: You Tyler?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: You're under arrest. I'll take your weapon.
text: TOBY hands over his RIFLE and begins to unbuckle his PISTOL BELT. TWO
text: MORE SOLDIERS appear from inside the open apartment.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What's he supposed to have done? What are
dialog: the charges?
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Dunno, ma'm. We're on orders.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Look...I'm Mary Henried. I'm with the
dialog: special conditioning center. I'm not
dialog: without influence...
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: (calmly) Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll
dialog: have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand
dialog: here and...
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: (more insistent) MARY!
text: She gives up. She looks into TOBY'S eyes.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I'll be alright. Just remember the things I
dialog: said. Take care of yourself.
text: THE SOLDIERS escort TOBY down the hall without force. MARY watches
text: their backs for a time, then she flings her BOOKS AND PAPERS angrily
text: into the open apartment. She begins to cry.
scene_heading: 88	EXT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SIX - NIGHT
text: HATCHWAY NUMBER SIX is surrounded by PROTECTIVE FENCING and, from it,
text: A FENCED ALLEYWAY runs off through the brush toward...we don't know
dialog: what yet.
text: THE HATCH OPENS and TOBY, along with TWO OTHER PRISONERS, also
text: disarmed troopers, is led down that alleyway by THREE GUARDS.
text: JOHN, SARAH AND BILL McDERMOTT peer out from nearby foliage. They
text: watch the procession. John whispers.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: The fences make a safe pathway to Stalag
dialog: Seventeen. That's where we live. That's
dialog: where you gonna live, too. Hell's half
dialog: acre. It's not a nice place. Them boys
dialog: there is prisoners. What's their
dialog: punishment? They sent out to the Stalag for
dialog: a few weeks. That's punishment enough.
text: SPIDER seems to appear from nowhere. She motions and the others
text: follow her through the thick jungle.
scene_heading: 89	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT
text: THE RUNNING FENCE LEADS TO A GATE IN A BIGGER FENCE. This one is
text: ELECTRIFIED. We know this because we see A COLLECTION OF ZOMBIES,
text: mostly "civilians" with no vests, clambering there, HANDS AND FACES
text: SPARKING WHEN THEY TOUCH THE CHAIN LINKS.
text: THE ZOMBIES send up wild MOANS AND GURGLES when TOBY AND THE OTHER
text: PRISONERS are led through the gate.
text: Inside the compound is A SCATTERING OF OPEN-SIDED MILITARY TENT-
text: BUILDINGS, resembling those on M*A*S*H. There's A DIN coming off the
text: place, a mixture of MUSIC AND VOICES that forms a disturbed blanket
text: of noise. The place seems to seethe like a hornets' next.
text: THE SOLDIERS head back for The Cave as POSTED GUARDS shut the gate
text: behind THE PRISONERS. TOBY and the other captives move toward the
dialog: "village".
scene_heading: 90	EXT. STALAG SEVENTEEN MAIN STREET - NIGHT
text: PEOPLE wallow in the mud. ONE MAN has just taken a shit and is wiping
text: his ass. Nearby A DRUNK lies unconscious. SEVERAL MEN are fighting.
text: It's a brutal fight with BOTTLES AND PIPES AND LENGTHS OF CHAIN. The
text: men are really hurting each other. PEOPLE SMOKE AND SNORT AND SHOOT
text: UP in wide open disarray.
text: A HUGE PREGNANT WOMAN plants herself right in TOBY'S path.
speaker_heading: PREGNANT WOMAN
dialog: How 'bout it, baby. I'm big but I'm
dialog: beautiful.
text: TOBY pushes past her and bumps into A SURLY DRUNK.
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: HEY, YOU FUCK! YOU FUCK!
text: He grabs TOBY and flings him violently against an upright on one of
text: the long huts. THE OTHER TWO PRISONERS move on, abandoning TOBY,
text: disappearing into the crowd. THE DRUNK pulls A RUSTED, HOME-MADE
speaker_heading: KNIFE.
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: I OUGHTA SLICE YOU UP, YOU FUCK! YOU CAN'T
dialog: PUSH ME AROUND LIKE... PUSH ME
text: AROUND...LIKE...
text: Suddenly VOMIT rises in the man's throat and he doubles over. TOBY is
text: aware of SOUNDS behind him. At his back, in the hut, A HAIRY FAT MAN,
text: still wearing his boxer shorts and his muddy boots, is wham-bam-
text: bamming A WHORE, who is wearing everything but underwear and boots.
text: There are needle tracks on the woman's arms and her face looks as
text: though she's been beaten brutally. She purses her deep red, damaged
text: lips and blows TOBY a kiss that's meant to be seductive.
text: TOBY moves on down the street. The place is a cesspool full of human
text: dregs, stinking with refuse, filled with the fury and desperation of
dialog: man in his last days.
scene_heading: 91	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT
text: JOHN leads his followers to within sight of the Stalag gates. ZOMBIES
text: still claw at the ELECTRIFIED FENCE. BLUE-WHITE SPARKS fill the air
dialog: like flashbulbs.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This is home, darlin'. Home for us that
dialog: don't make the grade. Us that ain't...good
dialog: enough to live inside The Cave. We grow a
dialog: little food, do a little light
dialog: manufacturin'...like these here vests, we
dialog: make these for the massers. We live in our
dialog: own filth, with bugs and snakes and disease
dialog: and jungle fever...all the time waitin' to
dialog: become breakfast for the Bees.
text: JOHN is doing a sales job on SARAH but everything he says is truth.
text: She hears it all, softening to JOHN'S cause.
text: SPIDER has silently lifted A LARGE WOODEN ROUND out of the weeds.
text: It's a camouflaged tunnel entrance.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: It's a tunnel. It's a couple hundred yards.
dialog: Just keep goin' 'til you reach the end.
dialog: I'll be right behind you.
text: SARAH starts down into the hole. JOHN and the others prepare to
text: follow. JUNGLE SOUNDS cover the noises they make.
scene_heading: 92	INT. THE HOSPITAL IN STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT
text: We see ROWS OF HOME-MADE COTS, each with A BODY lying on top. What
text: faces we see are gaunt, showing the boils and lesions of consumptive
text: diseases and tropical fever. INSECTS BUZZ and there is THUNDER in the
dialog: air.
text: An Oriental orderly, LUKEY, moves through the maze of bodies. He
text: lifts the wrist of A WOMAN WHO LOOKS DEAD and he discovers that she
text: is dead indeed. He hurries off.
scene_heading: 93	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT
text: This is a room with walls, an operating room with JURY-RIGGED
text: APPOINTMENTS. On A TABLE, under A HALF-DOZEN LIGHT BULBS, lies A
text: CORPSE. Another orderly, a Nordic type names DIESEL, an enormous man,
text: assists while DOCTOR LOGAN methodically SAWS OFF THE CORPSE'S HEAD.
text: LUKEY rushes in out of breath.
speaker_heading: LUKEY
dialog: Doc Logan! Doc Logan! Dere's a lady dead
dialog: out dere! Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry! Dunno
dialog: how long she been dat way! Maybe she
dialog: gettin' ready to come back.
text: THE CORPSE'S HEAD ROLLS AWAY FROM ITS BODY. DOC LOGAN picks up AN
text: ELECTRIC DRILL WITH A LONG BIT. WHZZZZZZZZZ! HE DRIVES THE SPINNING
text: BIT INTO THE DISEMBODIED HEAD, DEEP INTO ITS BRAIN. When he pulls it
text: out, MATTER FLIES as the motor winds down.
text: LOGAN is a middle aged man. He looks exhausted, demoralised, a bit
text: mad. And he looks as ill as some of his patients. There are OPEN
text: SORES on his face and he hasn't shaved for days. He's covered with
text: two week worth of BLOOD STAINS. He starts around the table leaving
text: DIESEL to dispose of the "DE-CAP".
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Bury the head. Call the guard for the rest.
dialog: Get it off the table for now. We'll bring
dialog: this new one in.
text: DIESEL doesn't respond right away. He's heard something.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DIESEL
dialog: The tunnel.
text: LOGAN hears it now, A SCRATCHING, SCUFFLING SOUND. He looks at his
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
text: God. It's almost sun-up.
text: LOGAN AND LUKEY move to a spot at the back of the room. They remove
text: SEVERAL OF THE PLANKS in the floor. SARAH'S head pops out, gasping
text: for air. Logan recoils, his eyes wide and frightened.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Who are you? Who are you?
text: He stands up too quickly. Dizziness makes him reel. He smashes into
text: AN INSTRUMENT CART, comes up with A LONG-BLADED SCALPEL and holds the
text: thing threateningly aimed at the stranger.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's OK. It's OK, Doc. She's with us.
text: In the next moment, SARAH and the others climb out of the tunnel.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This here's the hospital. That's Diesel
dialog: over there, the big guy. This here's Lukey
dialog: and that's Doc Logan who's about to cut
dialog: your tonsils out.
text: SPIDER, the last one to climb into the room, quickly begins
dialog: collecting WEAPONS, what few the rebels have.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This here's all the weapons we got. That's
dialog: why your fancy automatic looks so good to
dialog: us. We gotta stick it over here with the
dialog: others for now. They catch us with any kind
dialog: o' weapon and its death without even askin'
dialog: your name.
text: SARAH lets SPIDER take her GUN. The deaf mute signs something which
dialog: SARAH can't decipher.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ammunition. You got ammunition in your pack
dialog: there? I hope you do or the gun ain't worth
dialog: much.
text: SARAH roots through her SUPPLY PACK and produces THREE LOADED CLIPS
text: AND SEVERAL BOXES OF LOOSE SHELLS. JOHN notices SOME TINS OF FOOD,
scene_heading: MEDICINES, A KNIFE, A COMPASS...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We better just hide the whole pack,
dialog: darlin'. That stuff is just shoutin' out
dialog: that it come from the mainland. The shit we
dialog: get is all C.D. rations. Aspirins and
dialog: crackers from 1958.
text: SPIDER snatches THE PACK away rather roughly. SARAH is a little
text: disturbed by the action. THE MATERIAL is stashed under FLOOR BOARDS
text: beside the tunnel entrance.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Let's go. You look like you could use some
dialog: shut eye. Me too. We can all get acquainted
dialog: tomorrow.
text: LUKEY escorts JOHN AND SARAH out of the operating room into the main
text: hospital area. BILL McDERMOTT pulls out his empty flask.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Doc, I need a fill up. I'll help m'self if
dialog: it's alright with you.
text: LOGAN nods distractedly and BILL moves to A SUPPLY CABINET which
text: contains, among other essentials, SEVERAL BOTTLES OF BRANDY. He fills
text: his flask eagerly.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: How do we know she's alright? How do we
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: She's alright. Christ, Rhodes and his
dialog: cossacks wiped out her whole party. Dan
dialog: near got her.
text: McDERMOTT pockets the refilled flask, takes a long slug from the
text: cabinet bottle before putting it back, and moves out of the room.
text: LOGAN is left alone with DIESEL AND SPIDER.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: How do we know she's alright? How do we
dialog: know?
text: LOGAN repeats his question, intoned identically as it was before.
text: He's twitching slightly and sweat is pouring down his face. THE
text: THUNDER suddenly seems LOUDER.
speaker_heading: DIESEL
dialog: Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look
dialog: real bad.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I have looked bad for four years. Everyone
dialog: in the world has looked bad for four years.
dialog: Thank God looks don't matter as much as
dialog: they once did.
text: LOGAN, a wild gleam in his eye, moves out of the room, following
text: where the others went, that LONG-BLADED SCALPEL still clutched in his
text: hand. The others follow.
scene_heading: 94	INT. THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: JOHN, SARAH AND LUKEY are facing out across the compound. A TEEMING
text: TROPICAL RAIN has started to fall.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This just ain't your day, is it, darlin'
dialog: Sarah.
text: SARAH can't help but snicker. Suddenly her head spins exhaustion is
text: conquering her body as last. JOHN puts a big arm around her.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Three more minutes. Then you can sleep. You
dialog: gotta stay with it for three more minutes.
text: McDERMOTT joins them and the group moves out into the rain. LUKEY
text: waddles back through the maze of cots.
text: LOGAN, SPIDER AND DIESEL have moved to about the center of the big
text: room. The patients around them, their eyes bulging, look like lemurs.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: How do we know she's alright? How do we
dialog: know?
text: The same intonation again. This guy's wrapping is definitely coming
dialog: loose.
text: THE ZOMBIE rises up behind LOGAN'S back. It's the woman whose wrist
text: Lukey checked earlier. Its teeth are dripping with drool, its hands
text: reaching out wantingly.
text: LOGAN turns around. Calmly, but with the swiftness of a rattlesnake,
text: he shoots out the hand that's holding THE SCALPEL. THE BLADE SINKS
text: DEEPLY INTO THE ZOMBIE'S FOREHEAD. LOGAN pulls it out and strikes
text: again, and again, and again, like a swordsman thrusting, thrusting,
text: thrusting. Finally the creature collapses. LOGAN wipes the scalpel on
text: his already blood-covered apron. RAIN WATER drops onto him from holes
text: in the roof above. He doesn't seem to notice.
scene_heading: 95	EXT. STALAG SEVENTEEN MAIN STREET (RAIN) - NIGHT
text: THE STREET SCENE is toned down due to the late hour and the rain, but
text: just as vile, just as vicious. JOHN AND McDERMOTT escort SARAH. JOHN
text: speaks softly, and only when others on the street are far enough
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They supply us with disinfectant and dope.
dialog: Sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. What more
dialog: could anyone ask for? Most around here
dialog: ain't interested in changin' their lives.
dialog: The folks you met...me and them and a
dialog: couple others is the whole rebel army.
dialog: Nobody else gives a shit...and they're
dialog: afraid o' Rhodes.
text: They pass A STRUCTURE WITH AN OVERHEAD SIGN that reads: JOE'S CORNER
dialog: TAVERN. If there were walls they'd be pushed out by the MASS OF
text: HUMANITY inside. MUSIC BLARES and VOICES form a wall of noise louder
text: than the THUNDER. A FIGHT spills out onto the muddy street, PUSHERS
dialog: selling all sort of delights accost JOHN and his group.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: They seem to be havin' a good time. Some
dialog: punishment.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a
dialog: knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer
dialog: veins. You get lost out here and nobody's
dialog: gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It
dialog: all makes for food in the freezers.
text: They come to A LONG HUT WITH A SIGN that reads: THE RITZ.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This is your hotel. I'm not gonna stay here
dialog: with you but I'll always be close. You
dialog: gonna hafta take care o' yourself like you
dialog: said you was able to do.
text: SARAH nods. JOHN smiles at her. His warm, trustworthy eyes seem to
text: glow in the dark.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Some may notice that you're new. Just deny
dialog: it. You'll get away with it. Nobody really
dialog: looks at each other around here. Go on in.
dialog: Get some sleep.
text: He squeezes her hand tightly, then he turns away and moves off with
text: McDERMOTT. SARAH moves into THE RITZ.
scene_heading: 96	INT. THE RITZ (RAIN) - NIGHT
text: It resembles the hospital. There are ROWS AND ROWS OF COTS. SOME
text: PEOPLE SLEEP, alone and in pairs. OTHERS are awake, drinking,
text: screwing, shooting up. SARAH finds an empty cot and flops down.
text: Beyond the open walls she can see THE BLUE-WHITE FLASHES coming from
text: the electrified fence. RAIN LEAKS in on her but it doesn't keep her
dialog: from falling asleep.
scene_heading: 97	INT. THE CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING
text: TECHNICIANS are working with ZOMBIES while ARMED GUARDS stand ready.
text: We FOCUS ON A BLUE COAT. Under supervision, the thing is fumbling to
text: tie a shoelace. It's failing miserably but trying hard. ANOTHER BLUE
text: is busy placing LITTLE WOODEN SHAPES into their proper HOLES IN A
speaker_heading: BOARD.
text: TWO RED COATS sit at a table attended by HUMAN TECHNICIANS. We've
dialog: seen these zombies before, in the dormitory. TONTO, is...or was...a
text: native American, probably Seminole. In front of him is A PLATE
text: containing SEVERAL BITS OF MEAT. He has A FORK in his hand and he is
text: idly stabbing at the meat.
text: The other RED COAT, BLUTO, looks just like Bluto from Popeye, bulky
text: with a thick, black beard. Tired of THE JIG SAW PUZZLE he's working
text: on, he snarls and suddenly lunges for the meat on TONTO'S plate. He
text: snatches a handful and stuffs it in his mouth. As soon as he tastes
text: it, however, he pulls it back out, dribbling and spitting
dialog: disgustedly.
speaker_heading: FISHER (a technician)
dialog: They won't accept a substitute. They want
dialog: their Alpo.
text: TONTO has succeeded in forking a piece of meat. He moves it to his
text: mouth and pops it in.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Alright! Way ta go, Kemosabe!
text: MARY HENRIED has entered the room. She pulls up and watches TONTO
text: with a kind of dubious interest. TONTO stops chewing. He looks up
text: with exaggerated sadness on his face. Slowly his mouth opens and the
text: chewed piece of meat slides out between his lips. He throws his fork
dialog: down angrily.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: They won't learn to use forks if they don't
dialog: like the breakfast you're serving, Ted.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: The fork is like a game to them. If they
dialog: get into the game maybe they'll learn to
dialog: like the food.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It won't work.
text: Suddenly BLUTO jumps up from the table. He flings his chair aside and
text: tromps right over to MARY. His arms are outstretched and he is making
text: a pleading, Karloff-like SOUND. GUARDS come after him but MARY waves
dialog: them off.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's alright! Leave him alone!
text: MARY extends her right hand to meet BLUTO'S right and they shake
text: vigorously. Then the dumb creature drops his arms and looks around.
text: His brain sends no signal as to what he should do next. THE GUARDS
dialog: lead him away.
scene_heading: 98	INT. THE FIRING RANGE IN THE CAVE - MORNING
text: BLAM!!! A RED COAT is FIRING A PISTOL right AT THE LENS.
text: CLOSE ON: A TARGET, a flat, cut out silhouette of a man, BLACK
text: TRIANGLES painted on the instant-kill-zones, brain, heart. BULLETS
text: STRIKE the neck, the to torso, SOME RICOCHET off the wall behind.
dialog: None hit the kill-zones.
text: MARY HENRIED enters. The place resembles a Police Department target
text: range. RED COATS stand in stalls and FIRE down LONG ALLEYS at TARGETS
text: which pop up against the opposite wall. THE NOISE is deafening. TWO
text: TECHNICIANS are watching the shooters and keeping score. MARY walks
dialog: up to one of them.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Have you seen Julie Grant this morning?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: She should be in the behaviour rooms.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: She's not. Hasn't shown up yet.
text: There's AN OFF-SCREEN GROAN, the sound of a zombie trying to
text: communicate. MARY turns and sees the tall RED COAT names BUB standing
text: in the closest stall trying to attract MARY'S attention. (He was the
dialog: one Rhodes referred to last night as "Mary's pride and joy".) He is
text: wearing WESTERN-STYLE GUN BELTS, SIX-SHOOTER hang in HOLSTERS on both
text: his hips. MARY faces BUB full with her body and delivers a military
dialog: salute.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Good morning, Bub.
text: BUB replies with one of those pathetic sounds that obviously mean
text: something to him. Then he, too, salutes. MARY pulls away, heading for
text: AN EXIT, but BUB calls after her. He makes inarticulate sounds but we
dialog: catch his drift.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: I think he wants you to watch.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: OK, Bub. Do your stuff.
text: BUB turns towards the target wall looking like a gunfighter on a
text: western street. There's A HUMMING MECHANICAL SOUND. KATCHUNG! A
text: SILHOUETTE pops up. BUB slaps leather...fast... lighting fast. BOTH
text: GUN come up. BLAM-KA-BLAM-KA-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!!!
text: HOLES APPEARS IN THE TARGET...WOP-WOPPETY-WHUMP!!! All in the kill-
dialog: zones, or damn close.
text: BUB slaps ONE PISTOL back into its HOLSTER. He clicks open the shell-
text: chamber on THE OTHER, dumps the SPENT CARTRIDGES and begins to reload
dialog: from his belt.
text: MARY stares at the creature's back, mixed emotions showing on her
text: face. BUB turns to face her. Dropping a bullet, he salutes again.
text: MARY hesitates, then salutes back.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Very good, Bub. That's....very good.
scene_heading: 99	INT. A LOCKER ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING
text: PEOPLE are changing clothes, going on and off duty. JULIE GRANT
text: rushes in and moves to a locker where she pulls out her LAB COAT.
text: MARY HENRIED enters the room, spots JULIE, and rushes towards her.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Where the hell have you been?
text: JULIE doesn't respond. She buttons her coat never looking up.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Julie. Are you alright?
dialog: (still no response)
dialog: You were missed this morning. I need you. I
dialog: don't want you getting your ass in hot
dialog: water. I won't be able to help you if...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I don't need any help from you!
text: JULIE slams the locker door and storms away toward the exit.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Julie...JULIE!
text: But she's gone. The locker door has bounced open. MARY slams it and
text: it bounces again. She pounds it with her fist. Suddenly, A LOUD BELL
text: SOUNDS. MARY looks at her watch then exits.
text: There are TWO WOMEN cleaning the locker room with MOPS AND PAILS. One
text: of them turns to watch MARY HENRIED exit. We recognise her. It's
speaker_heading: SPIDER.
scene_heading: 100	INT. THE COUNCIL CHAMBER IN THE CAVE - MORNING
text: This is a large Situations Room that is serving now as GOVERNMENT
text: HEADQUARTERS. In A BIG, STUFFED OFFICE CHAIR behind A DESK FLANKED
text: WITH FLAGS sits GOVERNOR HENRY DICKERSON (former of Florida, now of
dialog: the world) A.K.A.... GASPARILLA.
text: At TABLES sit A DOZEN OR SO COUNCILMEN, Dickerson's cronies from the
dialog: old Doral Country Club, close friends who were offered asylum in the
dialog: private underground shelter. Now they sit in council, "yessing"
dialog: everything the boss man says.
text: A STATE PROSECUTOR has a DESPERATE-LOOKING PRISONER on the floor,
text: standing with his hands cuffed.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: He was found with a government-issue short-
dialog: wave transmitter in his quarters. He's
dialog: charged with the theft of that equipment
dialog: from a government installation and with
dialog: possession of an illegal radio.
text: GASPARILLA munches on SOME FRUIT. He's a fat man with a handlebar
text: moustache that makes him look like Pancho Villa. As an indication of
text: rank we wears a military jacket but underneath is a Hawaiian shirt
text: with a bold flamingo and palm tree pattern. Around his neck, nestled
text: in the rolls of fat there, is enough gold to stake a small business.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: I can only suggest that the court rule in
dialog: favour of the ultimate penalty for this
dialog: traitor.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: You always recommend the ultimate penalty,
dialog: Tommy Lee. You and Rhodes.
text: We now see that RHODES is present, looking on with a smile.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: All those...AGAINST...the ultimate penalty
dialog: raise yer hands.
text: None of THE COUNCILMEN move a muscle. GASPARILLA scans them slowly as
text: he takes a big, wet bite out of a peach.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Ya mean ta say nobody's gonna object to the
dialog: ultimate penalty in this here case? Well,
dialog: what if I object? What if I object to the
dialog: ultimate penalty.
text: THE COUNCILMEN look nervous, apprehensive. GASPARILLA'S flexing his
dialog: power-muscles.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: There's been a whole lotta swingin'
dialog: influence and swingin' weight arountyere
dialog: lately. Does anybody at all give two shits
dialog: fer what I think any more? Well, I'm a-
dialog: gonna let this guy off. How d'yall like
dialog: that? And I want the word ta git out I let
dialog: 'im off. I let 'im off. Not this council.
dialog: Maybe I can improve my image rountyere.
text: THE PRISONER looks up at GASPARILLA, hatred boiling inside him.
text: GASPARILLA meets his gaze with a power-mad sneer.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Yer sentenced ta hard labour. Stalag
dialog: Seventeen. A year.
speaker_heading: PRISONER
dialog: WHY DON'T YOU KILL ME! I PREFER TO DIE! I
dialog: DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH... WITH THIS KIND
dialog: OF...SIN!
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: WELL, PISS ON YOU, MISTER! I JUST SAVED
dialog: YOUR ASS! YOU DAMN WELL BETTER NOT GO
dialog: HOLLERIN' LIKE THAT IN HERE!
speaker_heading: PRISONER
dialog: I SPIT ON YOU! THE ULTIMATE PENALTY FOR
dialog: YOU! BURN IN HELL...FOR THE ULTIMATE SIN!
dialog: PIG! ALL OF YOU! PIGS!
text: GUARDS drag the screaming PRISONER from the room. GASPARILLA flops
text: back in his chair, flustered but unscarred. His skin is about a foot
text: thick. He pitches the peach and grabs up a mango. MARY HENRIED enters
text: the chamber and rushes toward an empty chair. GASPARILLA checks THE
text: DOCKET on his desk, smiles, and looks up at MARY.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence.
dialog: You're just in time fer a case that seems
dialog: ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about
dialog: the other proceedin's we been dealin' with
dialog: here this mornin'.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in
dialog: time fer this case, didn't ya?
text: RHODES replaces THE PROSECUTOR on the floor. He smiles at MARY
text: pointedly as he starts his speech.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Sir. In the matter of the State versus
dialog: Private Tyler, I don't want to...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (standing) Sir, Tyler is innocent of any
dialog: crime against the State. Captain Rhodes
dialog: is...
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: (with a mouthful of mango) Miss Henried, I
dialog: think you better...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: ...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
text: (spitting a wad of chewed pulp into his
dialog: hand) MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
text: MARY'S eyes indicate her frustration and anger but she does shut up.
text: GASPARILLA plops the handful of fruit pulp onto the floor wiping his
text: fingers on his military jacket.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: I don't want to take up a lot of time with
dialog: this. Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against
dialog: orders. There are eyewitnesses. I've
dialog: reprimanded Tyler and I've had him sent
dialog: outside. It's as simple as that.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Ya had 'im sent ta the Stalag? That's all
dialog: ya did to 'im?
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: The prisoner was dying, sir. Tyler acted
dialog: out of a sense of mercy. I don't believe
dialog: Tyler to be dangerous, General. He just
dialog: needs...discipline. Two or three months
dialog: outside will teach him...discipline.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sir. It's quite clear that...
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
speaker_heading: MARY
text: THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD
dialog: O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER
dialog: NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA
text: SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM
dialog: YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T
dialog: SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
text: MARY checks herself. There's a perverse air of danger fuming off the
text: fat General. His attitude toward MARY has clearly changed. RHODES has
text: been working on him. MARY seems to have lost this round. She can only
dialog: hope that's all she's going to lose.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Now I think Captain's punishment is fair,
dialog: considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got
dialog: shit ta complain about.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (softly, carefully) I'm sorry, General, if
dialog: I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr
dialog: Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has
dialog: no representation. I don't believe due
dialog: process is being served by...
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Listen, Missy. I am the only due process
dialog: that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one
dialog: of the people doin' the servin' from now on
dialog: is gonna be you. Now you been prancin'
dialog: aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer
dialog: long enough! All that's
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: gonna change, young lady. Now if you still
dialog: got a statement you'd like ta make, you can
dialog: jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Tonight?
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits.
dialog: We'll start out in my gymnasium an'
dialog: progress on from there...to various other
dialog: forms o' physical therapy.
text: MARY shoots a hate-filled eye full at RHODES. THE CAPTAIN responds
text: with a phoney look of sympathy.
scene_heading: 101	INT. GASPARILLA'S GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
text: The place is full of EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, TREADMILLS, WEIGHTS, A
text: NAUTILUS, ETC. There are other items which seem contradictory, PLUSH
text: PILLOWS, A HUGE CIRCULAR BED SURROUNDED BY MIRRORS. Delicacies of
text: FOOD AND DRINK lie about on LOW TABLES. The room is a cross between
text: Elaine Powers and a harem chamber.
text: A HUGE COFFIN-SHAPED DEVICE opens and we see that the inside is lined
text: with ULTRAVIOLET TUBES which are covered with plexiglass. GASPARILLA
text: lounges inside the thing, sweating, having just taken a long dose of
dialog: fake sunshine.
text: All around are THE COUNCILMEN, some with COUNTRY-CLUB TYPE WOMEN,
text: conservatively dressed and wearing suitable jewellery (obviously
text: wives left over from the good old days), and some with SCANTILY CLAD
speaker_heading: COURTESANS.
scene_heading: OTHER SCANTILY CLAD "BUNNY" TYPES are serving HORS-D'OEUVRES and
text: pouring WINE, offering SMOKE AND SNORT.
text: MARY HENRIED is sitting on the floor, lost in fluffy pillows, her LAB
text: COAT incongruous. RHODES watches her from nearby.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: AWRITE. C'MON LADIES. OFF WITH IT... AND ON
scene_heading: WITH IT...HA HA HA...
text: MUSIC BLARES and SEVERAL OF THE COURTESANS spring up, stripping off
text: what few clothes they are wearing. Some strip naked, others down to
text: panties. They hop onto various exercise machines and begin to
text: "workout", tits flopping, thighs pumping...GASPARILLA'S kind of
dialog: entertainment.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Oh, Lordy, Lordy...I'm drunk as a skunk.
dialog: Look at this...will ya jus' loooooook at
dialog: these lovelies! Say, Henried, you ever try
dialog: it with another woman?
text: MARY looks up at the General, not knowing whether or not she should
text: answer, afraid of what he might try to make her do.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: I've tried it with boys. Too strenuous.
text: FOUR MORE WOMEN have brought in SILVER PLATTERS full of NEW HORS-
text: D'OEUVRES, prepared carefully and laid them out like sushi. They're
dialog: distributed and people eat them
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Folks...I just couldn't resist. How d'yall
dialog: like those? How do those taste?
text: GUESTS look up, not knowing what to expect. MARY fears the worst. She
text: looks around to see RHODES grinning. A knot comes up into her throat.
text: She tries to swallow it down.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Fresh from the freezers, folks. It's
dialog: what...THEY...EAT!
text: A FEW OF THE GUESTS are revulsed. ONE MAN starts to vomit and he runs
dialog: from the room.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Just kiddin' folks. Just kiddin'. Would I
dialog: do a thing like that? I ask ya now, would
dialog: I? Hah ha ha ha ha...
text: Relief spreads and the bacchanalian atmosphere restores itself.
text: GASPARILLA spills himself out of the tanning coffin and flops down on
text: some pillows near MARY. He grabs up a goblet and swills red wine
text: which runs down his front.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: The great state of Florida. People came
dialog: here fer years ta die. Retire and expire.
dialog: The rest o' the country used ta think we
dialog: was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and
dialog: fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new
dialog: Capital o' the World! Hah! They came
dialog: here...died...went to hell...and the Devil
dialog: sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General
dialog: Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We think there are other cities surviving.
dialog: We think maybe Detroit... there's some
dialog: signalling out of Philly.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: There's no place like this place. Warm
dialog: climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't
dialog: nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the
dialog: Feds knew that. That's why they stored so
dialog: much o' their shit down here. It's all mine
dialog: now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come
dialog: after us down here, which they will some
dialog: day...take a likin' ta what all we got an'
dialog: come after us. They'll hafta get past my
dialog: army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha
dialog: ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA
dialog: HA....
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's not a very big army. And small as it
dialog: is you won't be able to continue feeding it
dialog: for very long. We've got to find ways of
dialog: getting them to respond without relying
dialog: on...
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when
dialog: ya do...we'll sail on over to the
dialog: mainland...or any other damn mainland fer
dialog: that matter...and start us a recruitin'
dialog: program. There's millions o' Bees out there
dialog: jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on
dialog: ta vict'ry!
text: GASPARILLA swallows another huge quantity of wine.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 102	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
text: The room is empty now. Remnants of food and drink clutter the place.
text: THE FAT GENERAL is asleep, snoring loudly, one of his pudgy arms is
text: draped across MARY HENRIED'S lap. She is trying to move out from
text: under without waking the man. She slides on the floor...a few
text: inches...a few inches more. GASPARILLA snorts and rolls over. His
text: eyes pop open, focus on MARY, and a smile pushes his fat cheeks back.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Well, hi there, y'all.
text: Mary looks down at the man, repulsed and afraid. Suddenly he grabs
text: her LAB COAT. She pulls away and he crawls after her, his belly
text: bouncing along the floor. BUTTONS POP and the coat falls open. He
text: reaches for her blouse. It tears away and for a moment he gets a
text: chubby handful of bare breast. He dives into her but he's unconscious
text: before his face reaches her chest.
text: MARY pulls herself out from under his dead weight. Shivering, she
text: clutches her blouse together and hurries out of the room.
scene_heading: 103	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - DAWN
text: Light is just breaking through the trees when THE GATES ARE OPENED
text: admitting FIVE UNIFORMED MEN into the compound. Outside the fence
text: ZOMBIES clamber excitedly as always.
scene_heading: 104	INT. THE RITZ - DAWN
text: SARAH jumps, awakened by A VOICE AND THE LOUD POUNDING OF RIFLES
text: against the upright of the sleeping hut.
speaker_heading: RHODES
scene_heading: REVEILLE! REVEILLE! RISE AND SHINE!
text: RHODES is standing near the entrance. FOUR SOLDIERS are doing the
text: pounding. Stunned, disease-ridden faces look up as CITIZENS are
text: awakened from sleep. Fear sweeps through the place like a tropical
dialog: wind.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: We found two white Bees in the jungle with
dialog: their heads chopped open. I want to know
dialog: who's going outside the compound. I want to
dialog: know how they're going out. I want to know
dialog: why they're going out. Until I get these
dialog: answers...each morning...some of you will
dialog: die.
text: Without warning RHODES draws his MAGNUM and...BLAM! BLAM! He shoots
text: TWO COT PEOPLE who happen to be at close range. They tumble to the
text: dirt floor, dead before they hit.
text: RHODES scans the rest of the hut. He spots a familiar face, THE
text: PRISONER from the Council Room, the one Gasparilla saved from a death
text: sentence. The man makes the sign of the cross, knowing what's coming.
text: BLAM! BLAM! RHODES FIRES TWO RAPID ROUNDS and THE PRISONER'S CHEST
text: TURNS RED. He flies off his cot into one adjacent, landing on top of
text: a SCREAMING WOMAN.
text: RHODES AND HIS MEN leave as abruptly as they entered. SARAH is
text: stunned. As PEOPLE around her react with sobs and more screams, she
text: locks her eyes on RHODES.
text: He is moving authoritatively down the street just outside the open-
text: walled structure. He passes within inches of SARAH'S cot which is
text: right against the outside rail. Her emotions well up inside her. She
text: is about to jump out into the street when A BIG BLACK HAND grabs her
text: arm. It's JOHN, who has pushed through the gathering crowd outside.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is
dialog: all happening because of me. If I turn
dialog: myself in...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He's just finding another reason for
dialog: bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us
dialog: ta die. He needs our bodies.
text: Behind JOHN on the street TOBY TYLER is looking on. He has heard the
text: conversation. JOHN turns and sees him. His eyes go dark with
dialog: apprehension.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and
dialog: so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Ain't no place safe.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Look...I know you have no reason to trust
dialog: me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got
dialog: some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm
dialog: gonna try to get off the island.
text: PEOPLE are pushing in closer attracted by the commotion inside the
text: Ritz. TOBY has to make it fast. He whispers.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the
dialog: hospital...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The hospital? (surprised, worried)
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red
dialog: crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me
text: at the hospital after the supplies come in.
dialog: Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Maybe.
text: TOBY drifts off into the crowd. JOHN AND SARAH exchange glances.
scene_heading: 105	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING
text: SUPPLIES are being brought in through THE MAIN GATES, CRATES,
scene_heading: CARTONS, BAGS OF GRAIN, SEED, FERTILISER.
text: TRICKS is in charge of the patrol from the Cave. He's checking items
text: as they're picked up by WORKERS from the compound. TOBY TYLER sidles
dialog: up to his friend.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
speaker_heading: TRICKS
dialog: Not as bad as yours, pal.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: (whispering) What'dya get?
speaker_heading: TRICKS
text: Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
text: LUKEY, the orderly, picks up A DOLLY which is LOADED DOWN WITH CRATES
text: MARKED WITH RED CROSSES.
speaker_heading: TRICKS
dialog: Hey, you. Those two on the bottom. Don't
dialog: open those yet. They might be from the
dialog: wrong shipment. Just keep 'em around 'til I
dialog: can check.
speaker_heading: LUKEY
dialog: Yessir. I never open 'em. Nossir. I keep
dialog: 'em innaback for you.
scene_heading: 106	EXT. FRONT STREET OF STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING
text: Watching from the shadows of A BUILDING are JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL.
speaker_heading: DIESEL
dialog: He's a spy. A spy for Rhodes.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Give him a chance.
text: They see TOBY pull away from TRICKS and start down the street
text: following LUKEY. They move out and catch up with TOBY, flanking him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You
dialog: tell him we was rebels?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two
dialog: crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
speaker_heading: SHORT CUT TO:
scene_heading: 107	INT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - MORNING
text: CREAK! A CROWBAR pries open A CRATE. JOHN AND LUKEY guard the
text: entrance while TOBY AND DIESEL work at opening the "Red Cross" boxes.
text: SARAH stands nearby. THE LIDS LIFT and we see TWO ARMY-ISSUE LIFE
dialog: RAFTS.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: There ya go. Complete with air
text: canisters...little motors.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We got a boat.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I say we got a boat. Can you get other
dialog: stuff?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope,
dialog: some automatic rifles.
speaker_heading: DIESEL
dialog: He's just tryin' to win us over. This
dialog: doesn't prove anything.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm gonna trust him, Diesel. He already
dialog: knows who we are and we ain't got a bunch
dialog: o' time to mess around with Rhodes shootin'
dialog: up the joint every mornin'.
text: TOBY, rooting through the open crates, finds THE PISTOLS TRICKS told
text: him about and A FEW BOXES OF AMMO. He tosses one of the guns to JOHN.
text: The big man walks over and puts the weapon back inside the crate.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Can't walk around here with these. Let's
dialog: just leave 'em here 'til we ready ta use
dialog: 'em.
scene_heading: 108	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON: HANDS carefully...very carefully...pouring DROPS OF CLEAR
text: LIQUID INTO A TEST TUBE. The liquid is sweating slowly out of A
text: MILDEWED AND ROTTING STICK OF DYNAMITE which has been softened to
text: near-melting by jungle heat.
text: A DOZEN TEST TUBES stand in a rack, already filled. SPIDER, another
text: woman, SALLY, and a man, JACK, each have their own DYNAMITE STICK.
dialog: Each is transferring LIQUID SWEAT...which is, of course, nitro
text: glycerine...into A GLASS TUBE. They work in tense silence on the
dialog: operating table.
text: DOC LOGAN works with them, doing the same delicate procedure.
text: Suddenly his hands starts to tremble.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Take it away from me. Quickly. Take it!
dialog: Take it!
text: SPIDER reaches over and, as gently as possible, takes the VIAL and
text: THE DYNAMITE out of the doctor's hands. She sets the tube in the rack
text: and returns the dynamite to AN OPEN CRATE, years old and crusted with
text: mildew and mud, still half-filled with sticks yet to be drained. The
text: danger passed, they all breathe a sigh of relief. LOGAN wipes the
text: river of sweat from his face. His hands are shaking quite violently
text: now. He pops pills, dry, from his pocket.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Sorry. I'm sorry. I'll, er...I'll be
dialog: alright...in a moment.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You're sick, Doc. You been sick for a while
dialog: now. Too sick to be workin' with us on this
dialog: raid.
text: JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL are standing in a corner of the room. TOBY
text: TYLER is with them, sweating and obviously nervous.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You've helped us enough, providin' cover,
dialog: hidin' us out. Let the rest of us handle
dialog: the physical stuff. It's too much for you.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: It's my fight as much as yours. The things
dialog: they made me do...the things they
dialog: made...me...do. I want so see Rhodes
dialog: destroyed. I want to see all of them, all
dialog: of them destroyed. It's my duty...in the
dialog: eyes of God. In the eyes of God.
text: LOGAN is really flipso now, over the edge into banana-land.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: It won't work. That's pure nitro you're
dialog: dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if
dialog: you look at is funny. What're you gonna do,
dialog: walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on
dialog: feather pillows? You don't have a complete
dialog: layout of the place. Even if you manage to
dialog: avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We're hopin' you can show us where ta go,
dialog: Toby.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island
dialog: alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not
dialog: goin' in there on a suicide mission. What
dialog: can you hope to accomplish? Some radios
dialog: maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be
dialog: killed and in a few weeks they'll be back
dialog: to business as usual. That place was built
dialog: to withstand nuclear attack! What are you
dialog: gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few
dialog: sticks of nitro?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We know what's down there. We did the
dialog: loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came
dialog: ashore in the early days. A direct hit
dialog: oughta do more than a few weeks worth o'
dialog: damage.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole
dialog: island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff?
dialog: How're you gonna leave yourself time to get
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: If we don't get out it's a small price to
dialog: pay.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You're fuckin' out of your minds! There's
dialog: two hundred people down there. You gonna
dialog: murder two hundred people?
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Sinners! Animals! Filth! Doing the work of
dialog: the Devil!
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: What about the people here in the camp? If
dialog: they don't get blown to kingdom come their
dialog: food'll be destroyed, their water, medical
dialog: supplies. They won't have any more power.
dialog: This island can't support them all, they'll
dialog: be doomed. Count me out, friends. I'm gonna
dialog: get my ass outa here. Anybody wants to come
dialog: along is welcome.
text: Silence falls over the room. Finally JOHN moves towards the door.
text: TOBY follows but before exiting he turns back to face the group once
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I wanna see Rhodes burn just a much as you
dialog: do...but all those people. We don't have
dialog: the right to be their judges... just like
dialog: they don't have the right to be our judges.
text: JOHN opens the door and TOBY exits. SARAH follows. JOHN looks around
text: at the faces in the group, then he leaves, shutting the door behind
text: him. There's a long silence, then LOGAN speaks.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: We know what we must do. It's written for
dialog: us in the Bible. "They shall be driven from
dialog: the land of the living down to the world of
dialog: the dead. That is the fate of those who
dialog: care nothing for God."
scene_heading: 109	INT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - DAY
text: LUKEY stands guard. McDERMOTT has joined SARAH AND JOHN in a strategy
text: huddle. TOBY stands nearby, feeling strangely guilty.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around
dialog: with their fingers up their asses while we
dialog: bust up their toys.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Datura.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't
dialog: worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's
dialog: a flower that grows on these islands. Where
dialog: I come from the voodoo priests used it
dialog: whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's
dialog: toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink
dialog: or inject it...or...in a sealed area it
dialog: might be introduced through the ventilation
dialog: system.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was
dialog: shouting! Datura Metel!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We always planned to use it. We got some
dialog: ground up already...but we could never find
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we
dialog: landed our boat.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: This stuff really works? No shit?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot
dialog: prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts
dialog: ya under fer a good night's sleep.

scene_heading: 110	EXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT
dialog: THE FISHING BOAT that bought SARAH and her friends to the island sits
text: still in the channel. There are SOLDIERS ABOARD, two of Rhodes' men,
text: pacing the deck, passing a bottle back and forth.
speaker_heading: JOHN (o.s.)
dialog: Well, we found yer boat, lady, but so did
dialog: they.
text: JOHN, SARAH AND TOBY are huddled behind green cover peering out at

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Looks like just two. We can take 'em when

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave

speaker_heading: TOBY
text: That entrance is closest to the labs and
dialog: the Bee cages.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Come on. Let's go.
text: They move off stealthily.
text: They enter the clearing with the spectacular PLANTS that Miguel
text: discovered. Six feet tall, their red-gold blossoms like trumpets with
dialog: their bells down, these are Daturas, nightshades indigenous to
dialog: southern Florida and parts of the Caribbean.
text: SALLY AND JACK, who we saw working on the nitro sticks, are chopping
text: off the eighteen-inch blossom and stuffing them into LARGE LEAF BAGS.
text: They're wearing HOSPITAL MASKS over their mouth and noses. JOHN moves
text: in to help. TOBY AND SARAH follow but JOHN stops them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Just stand guard for now. Spell us after a
dialog: while. Can't breathe this grass too long or

scene_heading: 111	EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE RITZ - NIGHT
text: MUSIC ROCKS AND VOICES SHOUT. The street scene is as wild as ever.
text: HOOKERS, PUSHERS AND DRUNKS pack the hot darkness.
scene_heading: 112	INT. THE RITZ - NIGHT
text: At A COT near the open wall, in DIM LIGHT FROM AN OVERHEAD BULB
text: OUTSIDE, SARAH, JOHN AND TOBY huddle. The DIN from the street makes
text: it impossible for others to hear them. TOBY is drawing A MAP.
speaker_heading: TOBY
text: Maintenance shafts run behind all the main
dialog: rooms. Nobody's in those at night. You can
dialog: use them to get around in. Hit the power
dialog: governors first. Kick a surge into their
dialog: computer network and you erase everything
text: stored in the memory. Then...over in
dialog: here...that's where the cages are...
text: On the street outside, a puffing BILL McDERMOTT pushes through the
text: unruly crowd, his face showing alarm.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: The Doc's gone. Diesel and Jack and Spider
dialog: with him. They took the guns... and the

scene_heading: 114	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT
text: JACK AND DIESEL are chopping a path through the undergrowth with
text: MACHETES. Behind them DOC LOGAN is walking slowly along with SPIDER,
text: guiding her carefully around obstacles. SPIDER is in major pain.
text: She's sweating rivers, her fists are clenched, she's biting her lover
text: lip so that it bleeds.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then
dialog: all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you
dialog: could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO
dialog: HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO
speaker_heading: HURT SO!
speaker_heading: DIESEL
dialog: Quiet!
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
text: Suddenly, A ZOMBIE lunges from the underbrush, its FACE BADLY
text: DETERIORATED and one of its hands; lost during its human life,
text: replaced by A MECHANICAL HOOK. SPIDER stumbles. She holds her breath
text: and stiffens all her muscles. Miraculously the nitro vials inside her
text: do not explode. LOGAN throws himself quixotically in front of THE
speaker_heading: ZOMBIE.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
text: FALLEN ANGEL! THIS IS THE JUDGEMENT DAY
dialog: WHEN YOU WILL BURN FOR YOUR SINS! THE LORD
dialog: WILL CAST YOU DOWN TO THE LOWER REACHES AND
dialog: YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW....
text: THWOK!!! THE ZOMBIE'S STEEL HOOK SINKS DEEPLY INTO LOGAN'S UPPER
text: CHEST. The man's eyes reflect no immediate sensation. His speech
text: falters but only slightly.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: ...YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN... THE
dialog: PAIN...
text: THE ZOMBIE pulls LOGAN towards its DROOLING, WIDE OPEN MOUTH. It's
text: just about to bite when DIESEL CHOPS HIS MACHETE INTO THE CENTER OF
text: THE CREATURE'S SKULL. The thing falls, pulling LOGAN, still hooked,
text: to the ground with it.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN OF HELL...
text: THE PAIN OF HELL.
text: DIESEL frees the doctor's shoulder from the hook. BLOOD FLOWS FREELY.
text: DIESEL grabs a handful of DRESSINGS from LOGAN'S PACK and goes to
dialog: work on the wound.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: ...the pain of Hell...the pain...the
dialog: pain...
scene_heading: 115	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE VENTS - NIGHT
text: SARAH, SALLY, LUKEY AND McDERMOTT stand by while JOHN AND TOBY swing
text: open THE RUSTED GRILLWORK OF AN AIR-VENT in the ground. TOBY is able
text: to swing his upper torso completely down inside.
scene_heading: 116	INT. THE VENT - NIGHT
text: TOBY hangs up-side-down in A RUSH OF AIR. He tightens A HOSPITAL MASK
text: over his nose and mouth.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Okay. Lemme have 'em.
text: A LEAF BAG is passed in from above. TOBY flags the bag open and BITS
text: OF FLOWER AND POLLEN DUST FLY through the tight space, sucked off
dialog: into the duct.
scene_heading: 117	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON: A GRILL NEAR THE CEILING. BITS OF TOXIC POLLEN and AN
text: OCCASIONAL PIECE OF FLOWER blow into the room.
text: There are SIX TECHNICIANS AND TWO SECURITY GUARDS posted at various
text: stations. A RADIO MAN looks up.
speaker_heading: RADIO MAN
dialog: What's that? Smell it?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Dunno. Must be comin' from outside. Kinda
dialog: nice.
scene_heading: 118	INT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SEVEN - NIGHT
text: There are only TWO GUARDS posted at the sealed entrance. One is
text: eating from A CAN OF SPAM. The other is reading an old, dog-eared
text: PLAYBOY. A RIFLE BARREL jabs suddenly into "Playboy's" back.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Don't move!
text: It's JULIE GRANT, Mary's disgruntled assistant. A YOUNG MAN, another
text: behaviouralist in a WHITE LAB COAT is with her. They both have
speaker_heading: RIFLES.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Open the outer door. Move it!
text: "Playboy" slowly gets up and starts towards A CONTROL PANEL. At the
text: last minute, he spins around, grabbing JULIE'S GUN BARREL and pushing
text: it away. JULIE'S YOUNG ACCOMPLICE swings his RIFLE BUTT and knocks
text: "Playboy" cold. Then he trains the weapon on "Spam man" again.
text: JULIE moves to the controls, examines them, trips A TOGGLE marked
text: "LOCK" and pushes A LARGE GREEN BUTTON.
text: THE DOOR TO THE OUTSIDE SWINGS OPEN. Beyond is blackness with an
text: occasional patch of MOONLIGHT ON JUNGLE GROWTH. JULIE walks slowly,
text: carefully toward the opening. Just as she is about to cross the
text: threshold into the night, A HUGE FIGURE leaps at her, grabbing her
text: RIFLE and enclosing her in a strangle hold. It's DIESEL. Behind him,
text: comes JACK, his RIFLE (Sarah's rifle) levelled off at JULIE'S YOUNG
speaker_heading: FRIEND.
text: "Spam man" makes a break for it down the hall. Reacting nervously,
text: too quickly, JACK FIRES. "SPAM MAN" IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE BACK. He
text: pitches forward, dead.
text: THE YOUNG SCIENTIST raises his gun.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Hey! What the hell.....?
text: JACK FIRES ANOTHER BURST and the ORANGE CIRCLE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S
text: CHEST SHOW A DOTTED LINE OF RED. He flies back, a surprised
text: expression on his face, and he flops, dead, right on top of the
text: "Playboy" guard who is lying near the control booth.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
text: ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH!
text: THE DOC comes slowly out of the night guiding SPIDER over the
text: threshold and into the hall. LOGAN reminds us of a crazy John
text: Houston, floating on air in a madman's bubble.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What...what is this? Who...?
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: It's alright, it's alright, my dear. You've
dialog: simply helped us do the Lord's work.
text: LOGAN'S SHOULDER WOUND IS BLEEDING THROUGH ITS DRESSINGS but the
text: doctor, on a holy mission, seems to feel no pain. He guides SPIDER
text: into the light and opens her shirt. DIESEL shoves JULIE against a
text: wall. JACK covers her with his AUTOMATIC.
text: LOGAN removes RED-SOAKED DRESSING from SPIDER'S skin. All over her
text: bare chest and upper belly we see LONG, EIGHT-INCH SCARS, HASTILY
text: STITCHED WITH SUTURE SHOWING. Beneath each is A CIGAR-SHAPED BULGE
text: where a vial of nitro has been implanted. The woman stands on
text: crumbling legs, her arms open outward, a grotesque lampoon of a
dialog: stigmatic.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What...what have you done to her?
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: God forgive us. Forgive us the pain we
dialog: inflict as surgeons. We'll be in Heaven,
dialog: child. Soon. We'll be with Him in Heaven.
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: Na...na...ak...aaaaaaaaaa...
text: SPIDER is trying to signal something. She has seen that "PLAYBOY" is
text: crawling into the control booth. LOGAN follows her alarmed gaze.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: NO YOU DON'T I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT! I
speaker_heading: CAN'T!
text: LOGAN charges toward the booth. THE GUARD is half-in-half-out of the
text: glass chamber, his hands reaching for the control panel inside. LOGAN
text: starts to kick him, again and again.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Outa the way, Doc! Outa the way!
text: There's vengeance on LOGAN'S face. He's kicking THE GUARD brutally,
text: but that doesn't stop the man from reaching the controls. He hits A
text: RED ALARM BUTTON. THE PANEL BUZZES AND COLOURED LIGHTS BLINK. THE
text: DOOR to the jungle starts to swing closed. DIESEL dives at it but
text: can't stop the steel slab. It slams with A LOUD THUNNNNNG!
text: JACK swings into another position to get a clear shot and he FIRES A
text: LONG BURST into the control booth. "PLAYBOY" IS STRUCK BY SEVERAL
text: ROUNDS. He bounces around in the booth and collapses to the floor,
dialog: dead.
text: LOGAN, his SHOULDER WOUND POURING BLOOD, aggravated by his physical
text: exertion, falls to floor himself, in a faint.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: DIESEL
dialog: Keep the woman covered.
text: JACK levels off on JULIE again. DIESEL moves over to SPIDER. Pulling
text: FRESH DRESSING from LOGAN'S BAG, the big man begins to pack them onto
text: SPIDER'S BLEEDING CHEST.
scene_heading: 119	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON: A BLINKING RECTANGLE OF RED LIGHT. Written on its face is:
text: ALARM - GATE 7. A BELL RINGS LOUDLY in the room. THE SHOT WIDENS and
text: we see FIVE MEN, all slumped, unconscious, none able to react to the
dialog: alarm.
text: ONE OF THE SECURITY GUARDS has made it to THE EXIT. He manages to
text: push the door open, but then he falls in a heap.
text: A RADIO MAN staggers into A WEBBING OF WIRES, then he too falls.
text: THE OTHER SECURITY GUARD inches his hand towards A LEVER WITH A
text: PROTECTIVE COVER. He flips the cover up, then collapses. The falling
text: action causes his fingers to trip the lever. A HUGE KLAXON SOUNDS. A
text: BLINKING RECTANGLE, huge over the doors, reads: GENERAL ALERT!
scene_heading: 120	INT. GASPARILLA'S GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
text: The usual scene here, GASPARILLA AND HIS COURTESANS entertaining THE
text: COUNCILMEN AND THEIR LADIES. THE KLAXON SOUNDS over THE LOUD ROCK
text: MUSIC. MARY HENRIED, a prisoner for the evening again, hears THE
text: SOUND. Her eyes widen. She looks over at RHODES, who jumps to his
text: feet. The party gradually goes silent.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: Don't be alarmed. We're impregnable. Stay
dialog: where you are. Nothing will happen to any
dialog: of you. You're safe here. Men.
text: This last word to A SMALL UNIT OF FOUR TROOPERS standing guard at THE
text: EXIT. RHODES goes steaming through the doors. TWO OF THE TROOPERS
text: FOLLOW, THE OTHER TWO unsling their RIFLES and take up posts just
text: outside in the corridor. THE STEEL DOOR SLIDES SHUT locking
text: GASPARILLA AND HIS COURT inside the gymnasium...MARY HENRIED with
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: Well, c'mon, ladies and gents. Who says we
dialog: gotta let our evenin' get spoiled? Simon
dialog: sez...GET DOWN!!!
dialog: MOST OF THE GUESTS are willing to let the party get back to full
text: swing. GASPARILLA grabs A TOPLESS COURTESAN and rocks his fat belly
text: around in an attempted dance. MARY seems to be the only one concerned
dialog: about the alarm.
scene_heading: 121	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT
text: Even outside THE KLAXON CAN BE HEARD. TOBY AND THE REBELS stop in
dialog: their tracks.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta
dialog: got in!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What you wanna do?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Come on!
text: THE GROUP moves out urgently.
scene_heading: 122	INT. ENTRANCE NUMBER TWO - NIGHT
text: A CIRCULAR LIGHT BLINKS GREEN with A BUZZING SOUND. THE TWO INSIDE
text: GUARDS punch up A VIDEO MONITOR. The screen shows TOBY TYLER AND
text: LUKEY holding PISTOLS on SALLY AND BILL McDERMOTT.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (into intercom) What's goin' on?
speaker_heading: TOBY (filter)

speaker_heading: TOBY (filter)
dialog: (on video) FER CHRISSAKE! LEMME IN, DAMMIT!
speaker_heading: LEMME IN!
text: THE FIRST GUARD HITS A BUTTON AND THE BIG STEEL ENTRANCE DOOR SWINGS
text: OPEN. THE REBELS storm in like an ocean wave taking the hapless
text: GUARDS completely by surprise. They knock them unconscious and take
text: their WEAPONS. TOBY pushes A BUTTON which causes the outer door to
text: swing shut, then he leads the band down the corridor.
text: They go through A DOOR about a hundred yards from the entrance.
scene_heading: 123	INT. MAINTENANCE SHAFT - NIGHT
text: This is one of the WORK CORRIDORS that TOBY mentioned earlier. THE
text: REBELS run, single-file, deep into the Cave.
scene_heading: 124	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT
text: JULIE GRANT has been ROPE-TIED to an eyelet in the wall. DIESEL sets
text: down A PISTOL AND A BOX OF AMMO beside DOC LOGAN who is sitting on
text: the floor beside the control booth. He's having trouble catching his
text: breath. His WOUND has turned his ENTIRE FRONT RED.
speaker_heading: DIESEL
dialog: You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
text: SPIDER, her shirt buttoned again over her new dressings, is carefully
text: signing something. DIESEL reads her fingers.
speaker_heading: DIESEL
dialog: Maps. Yes. She was supposed to bring us
dialog: maps.
text: JACK steps over to JULIE. He frisks her pockets and finds TWO HAND-
text: DRAWN MAPS showing complete layouts of the Cave.
speaker_heading: DIESEL
dialog: Alright. Let's go.
text: They move out, DIESEL supporting SPIDER, JACK with his RIFLE ready.
scene_heading: 125	INT. A SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT
text: TOBY breaks open A CARTON and pulls GAS MASKS out. He passes them
text: back to BILL McDERMOTT AND SARAH.
scene_heading: 126	INT. THE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT
text: THE REBELS, all wearing GAS MASKS, burst into the room. TOBY moves
text: right toward AN INTERCOM. He punches in a code and waits while the
speaker_heading: INTERCOM BUZZES.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Come on, Mary. Answer. ANSWER!
text: Nothing. Toby punches up another code while the others drag THE
text: UNCONSCIOUS GUARD out of the doorway, letting the doors shut behind
text: them. A VOICE comes over the speakers.
speaker_heading: TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Tricks, it's Tyler. We're inside.
speaker_heading: TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
dialog: What? Was that you that set off the alarms?
speaker_heading: TOBY
text: No. There's some loonies from outside.
dialog: They're gonna try to blow the powder
dialog: magazine.
speaker_heading: TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
dialog: Where are you? What's the plan?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Find Mary. If you can get help do it. We're
dialog: gonna hit the power station and haul-ass

dialog: exit five in exactly ten minutes.
speaker_heading: TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
dialog: I think I can get a couple guys.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: And Mary! You gotta find Mary!
speaker_heading: TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
dialog: I'll try, Tob. I'm gone.
text: TRICKS clicks off. TOBY levels his AUTOMATIC at the RADIO CONSOLE and
text: FIRES. SPARKS FLY, CHUNKS OF WOOD AND METAL SHOOT OFF IN EVERY
speaker_heading: DIRECTION.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: HOLD ON! HOLD ON! Yer wastin' yer
dialog: ammunition. Hit 'er in here...then around
text: back in the circuit boards.
text: TOBY levels off again, this time at the "kill-zones". BULLETS FLY.
text: MORE SPARKS DANCE as THE UNIT BREAKS APART.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: (shouting) AND OVER HERE. THE ALARM
scene_heading: SYSTEMS. THESE CENTRAL PANELS HERE. THESE
speaker_heading: CIRCUITS.
text: SARAH AND SALLY step up and start BLASTING. A PROFUSION OF SPARKS
text: this time as THE ALARM SYSTEMS SEEM TO EXPLODE.
text: Suddenly A COLLECTION OF RED LIGHTS START BLINKING URGENTLY. A BELL
text: SOUNDS. THE LARGE RECTANGLE OVER THE EXIT IS FLASHING A NEW WORD:
text: EVACUATE! EVACUATE! EVACUATE!
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: Jesus, Mary and Joseph! (he slugs from his
dialog: flask) By blowin' the alarm panels...we

scene_heading: 127	INT. CORRIDORS IN THE CAVE - NIGHT
text: MONTAGE: A LOUD BUZZING IS HEARD as DOORS OPEN everywhere, some
text: sliding, some swinging back, some rolling into the walls. TROOPERS
text: caught trotting through halls are taken by surprise. CITIZENS spill
text: out of apartment doors that have opened electronically.
scene_heading: 128	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT
text: THE DOOR TO THE JUNGLE SWING OPEN. JULIE GRANT looks over at DOC
text: LOGAN. The madman struggles to his feet. Supporting himself against
text: the wall of the control booth, he reaches inside and starts pushing
dialog: buttons.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Those buttons won't work! The evacuation
text: command overrides them.
text: JULIE looks through the open entranceway. Barely visible in the DIM
text: BLUE MOONLIGHT are the hulking shapes of TWO...NO THREE ZOMBIES,
text: approaching the open hatch.
scene_heading: 129	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: McDERMOTT is explaining to the others.
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: All the doors in the Cave have been sprung
dialog: open...all the ones that work on electric.
dialog: It's so nobody'll get trapped anywhere.
scene_heading: 130	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

scene_heading: 131	INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

scene_heading: 132	INT. A HOLDING PEN IN THE CAVE - NIGHT
text: We see A LARGE PEN, its GATE SWINGING OPEN. From inside, MOANING
text: HUNGRILY, come FORTY OR FIFTY ZOMBIES, BLUE COATS AND WHITE.
text: GUARDS outside the pen start to panic. They OPEN FIRE. A FEW ZOMBIES
dialog: ARE HIT but there are too many, way too many. THE GUARDS turn tail
text: and retreat off into the Cave.
dialog: THE ZOMBIES are out! Free to find their own suppers!
scene_heading: 133	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
text: THE DOORS have opened here, too. THE CROWD, having heard the
text: EVACUATION SIGNAL, is panicking. MANY are running out past THE GUARDS
text: and into the hallway. GASPARILLA is trying to reinstate calm.
speaker_heading: GASPARILLA
dialog: STAY HERE! STAY PUT! WE'LL BE ALRIGHT!
text: WE'RE SAFE HERE! JUST AS SAFE AS ANYWHERE
dialog: 'TIL WE FIND OUT WHAT'S GOIN' ON!
text: MARY HENRIED takes advantage of the confusion. She slips out behind
scene_heading: TWO COUNCILMEN AND THEIR LADY-FRIENDS.
scene_heading: 134	INT. NURSERY CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: THE HALLWAY is in chaos. TROOPERS run by, CRAZED CITIZENS flee in
text: both directions. MARY HENRIED is stopped by A NURSE standing in AN
speaker_heading: OPEN DOORWAY.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: What is it? What's happening?
speaker_heading: MARY
text: It's an evacuation signal. The radios are
text: out. People are panicking.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: What should we do?
text: MARY looks past THE NURSE into A ROOM where A GROUP OF CHILDREN, a
text: dozen or so, ranging from twelve-years-old down to infancy, are
text: huddled. Some are crying.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: God. I, er...I dunno what to say. It could
dialog: be a real evacuation or it could just be a
dialog: glitch in the system. Wait here for now.
dialog: I'll...I'll make sure you get the word what
dialog: to do, okay?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Please...hurry...
text: MARY takes off down the hall.
scene_heading: 135	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON: JULIE GRANT'S FACE, screaming, in agony, on the brink of
text: insanity. THE ZOMBIES have reached her. They're started to pull at
text: her arms, her legs. ONE BITES HER HAND, ANOTHER HER ARM, ANOTHER HER
speaker_heading: CALF.
text: DOC LOGAN is watching from the control booth, all the while fiddling
text: with BUTTONS, DIALS, LEVERS.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: We'll be in Heaven soon. We'll all be in
dialog: Heaven soon.
text: (Julie's screams penetrate the fog in his
dialog: brain. He frowns.)
dialog: Pain. God forgive the pain inflicted by
dialog: surgeons. We must atone. We must atone for
dialog: our sins.
text: His eye is attracted to A LARGE LEVER seemingly separate from
text: everything else. It's marked: SIREN. He pulls it.
speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: We must...atone. We must.
scene_heading: 136	EXT. THE SIREN HORN - NIGHT
text: Slowly, THE THROATY WAIL RISES and calls out over the jungle. It's
dialog: the "Feeding Signal" we heard earlier.
scene_heading: 137	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT
text: MONTAGE: as everywhere in the jungle ZOMBIES turn toward the call of
text: THE SIREN. They start to walk...toward the SOUND, toward the place
dialog: where there is food.
scene_heading: 138	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT
text: JULIE is still screaming wildly. THE ZOMBIES ARE TEARING HER APART,
speaker_heading: LITERALLY.
text: DOC LOGAN inadvertently kicks THE PISTOL left by DIESEL and is

speaker_heading: LOGAN
dialog: WE WILL ATONE. WE WILL BE THE
scene_heading: SACRIFICE...THE COMMUNION...WE OFFER
text: OURSELVES UP...OUR SOUL...AND OUR BODIES...
text: JULIE GRANT finally loses consciousness. MANY MORE ZOMBIES are
text: pressing in through the entrance now. They reach LOGAN and start to
text: tear at him. Something clicks in his brain and he realises what's
text: happening. He starts to scream. His hands find THE PISTOL on the
dialog: floor.
text: ONE ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF HIS LEFT ARM. He shrieks and brings up
text: THE PISTOL, FIRING. THE FIRST SHOT RIPS OPEN THE CREATURE'S SKULL.
text: The next FIVE SHOTS are wasted, FIRED WILDLY. The GUN CLICKS emptily
text: as THE ZOMBIES engulf him, TEARING, BITING, EATING HIM ALIVE.
dialog: MORE ZOMBIES come out of the jungle...a lot more...called by the

speaker_heading: TRICKS
dialog: Toby's in the Cave. We're gonna make our

dialog: magazine. Come on. Come with us.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Where are you goin' out?
speaker_heading: TRICKS
dialog: Exit five.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: See ya there.

speaker_heading: TRICKS
scene_heading: SEVEN MINUTES, MARY. EXACTLY SEVEN MINUTES!
scene_heading: 140	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT
text: RHODES AND EIGHT TROOPERS turn a corridor and there, before them, is
text: a sight out of Dracula's tomb. Moving through the lava-stone arches,
text: between the giant earthen pillars, is THE ARMY OF BLUE AND WHITE
dialog: ZOMBIES. RHODES and his men can't possibly fight them, there are too
text: many. RHODES spots A DOOR WITH A CAGED RED LIGHT OVERHEAD. They can
text: get to it by slicing through only A FEW OF THE ADVANCING GHOULS.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: THIS WAY. OVER HERE! SHOOT! SHOOT THEM!
dialog: SHOOT TO KILL! IN THE HEAD!
text: Their RIFLES BLAZE as they drive through the edge of THE ZOMBIE
text: HORDE. SEVERAL OF THE CREATURES GO DOWN, THEIR HEADS BLASTED OPEN BY
scene_heading: RAPID-FIRE ROUNDS.
text: ONE grabs RHODES by the sleeve of his jacket. The captain turns on
text: his heels and stares at the thing with outraged disbelief. He raises
text: his MAGNUM and pumps TWO QUICK SHELLS INTO THE CREATURE'S BRAIN.
text: THE PLATOON finally reaches the door. RHODES holds it open while his
text: MEN run inside. He holsters his PISTOL and unslings his AUTOMATIC.
text: THE ZOMBIES press towards him. He selects A FEW OF THE CLOSEST ONES,
text: aims, and FIRES, with a look of enjoyment on his face. For a moment
text: he resembles Doc Logan, madness bristling inside him.
text: THE ZOMBIES fall, THEIR HEADS SHATTERED, ONE OF RHODES' MEN calls
text: from inside the doorway.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Captain...CAPTAIN!
text: RHODES FIRES ANOTHER QUICK BURST, then he turns and moves through the
dialog: doorway.
scene_heading: 141	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT
text: SPIDER is walking along, careful to avoid jolts, support-under her
text: arms by the giant DIESEL. JACK walks with them, his nervousness
text: irritated by the need to move slowly. CITIZENS run past, none of them
text: paying attention to the desperadoes.
text: Suddenly they encounter A TROOP OF SOLDIER who come trotting around a
text: corner. Nervous JACK OPENS FIRE. TWO SOLDIER GO DOWN. A gunfight
text: erupts as the rest of the TROOPS scatter in the hallway, CIVILIANS
text: are caught in the crossfire. TWO ARE HIT.
text: DIESEL manages to steer SPIDER around a corner to safety. JACK keeps
text: FIRING but he's trapped in A HAIL OF BULLETS. A RED LINE CUTS ACROSS
text: HIS CHEST and he flies back, dead, his GUN STILL FIRING.
text: Out of the Troopers' sight, DIESEL checks his map and moves into A
text: DOORWAY, one of several on the area, guiding SPIDER through beside
dialog: him.
scene_heading: 142	INT. ANOTHER MAINTENANCE SHAFT - NIGHT
text: They find themselves in one of those work corridors. The giant man
text: shoulder his RIFLE and gently lifts SPIDER into his arms. He moves,
text: as smoothly as he can, down the shaft and around a bend.
scene_heading: 143	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT
text: TOBY leads JOHN AND THE REBELS out into A HALLWAY. They break across
text: to an opposite door. Before they can escape, A TROOP OF SOLDIERS
text: appears. A GUNFIGHT ENSUES.
text: TWO SOLDIERS GO DOWN. JOHN IS WOUNDED IN THE SHOULDER but he stays on
text: his feet. THE SOLDIERS have them divided in the two opposite
dialog: doorways.
text: Suddenly, TRICKS AND HIS BUDDIES come charging around a corner. THEY
scene_heading: OPEN FIRE. THE SOLDIERS RESPOND. TWO MORE SOLDIERS GO DOWN. ONE OF
text: TRICKS' MEN IS KILLED. TRICKS himself IS WOUNDED BADLY IN THE
speaker_heading: STOMACH.
text: Caught in a crossfire, THE LAST FOUR TROOPERS throw down their guns.
text: They flee wildly down the corridor. THE REBELS pick up and file
text: through one of the doors. TOBY rushes to aid his BADLY WOUNDED BUDDY.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Tricks...Jesus...
speaker_heading: TRICKS
dialog: I'm alright. Let's go.
text: They follow after the others.
scene_heading: 144	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
text: A SCREAM GOES UP! A WOMAN near the exit has spotted something
text: terrifying in the hallway. THE GUARDS panic. ONE OF THEM OPENS FIRE.
scene_heading: 145	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
text: A MASS OF ZOMBIES COME SHUFFLING DOWN THE CORRIDOR. Their VOICES ECHO
dialog: IN GROTESQUE HARMONY, the song of the living dead that we've heard
dialog: before.
scene_heading: 146	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
text: THE GUARDS are trying to close the entrance doors manually. The big
text: slabs won't budge. Suddenly GASPARILLA appears. Drawing A PISTOL from
text: A HOLSTER he wears, without warning he SHOOTS ONE OF THE GUARDS. THE
text: OTHER GUARD flees.
text: GASPARILLA falls onto the dead man and rips off his ORANGE-CIRCLE
text: VEST. THE ZOMBIES are pressing in now, into the gymnasium. GASPARILLA
text: AND SEVERAL REMAINING PARTY-GOERS (none with vests) are trapped.
scene_heading: 147	INT. A CORRIDOR NEAR THE DORMITORY - NIGHT
text: MARY is running along with THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN. Suddenly, from
text: out of a doorway, comes CAPTAIN RHODES WITH HIS STORM TROOPERS.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: HENRIED! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
text: Without answering, MARY leads her band through A MANUAL DOOR that
text: leads to the Dormitory.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: STOP THEM! SHOOT!
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: The...the children, sir.
speaker_heading: RHODES
dialog: After them then! I want them stopped! That
dialog: woman is dangerous!
scene_heading: 148	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY - NIGHT
text: MARY AND HER REFUGEES are stopped in their tracks by BUB AND HIS
text: CADRE OF RED COATS. THE NURSE screams and tries to back away. THE
text: CHILDREN cling to her, petrified, shrieking, starting to cry.
text: BUB lumbers up to MARY and...salutes. MARY returns the formality.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's alright. I don't think they'll hurt
dialog: us. Try to stay calm.
scene_heading: 149	INT. THE OUTER CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: THE MANUAL DOOR has been locked from inside.
speaker_heading: RHODES
speaker_heading: SHOOT IT OPEN!
text: THE SOLDIERS follow orders, TWO OF THEM FIRING AT THE LOCK.
scene_heading: 150	INT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT
text: MARY is at A CABINET pulling out PISTOLS AND RIFLES, passing the
text: weapons around to TONTO, BLUTO, SAMSON. BUB is strapping on his TWO-
text: GUN HOLSTER SET all by himself, fumbling a little, but succeeding.
scene_heading: 151	INT. THE CORRIDOR WITH RHODES - NIGHT
text: RHODES' MEN kick open the door and charge into the Dormitory
dialog: corridor.
scene_heading: 152	INT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT
text: THE NURSE slams ANOTHER MANUAL DOOR, locking and bolting it.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: They're coming! They're coming!
text: She hurries along the caged alley behind the firing stalls guiding
text: THE CHILDREN to an opposite exit.
text: BLAM! BLAM! MARY IS FIRING at AN ORANGE CIRCLE VEST on one of the cut
text: out target figures in the range. THE RED COATS are watching with
text: curiosity, cocking their heads.
text: MARY moves to fire again but BLUTO grabs her hand.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: NO...BLUTO...I'M TRYING TO...
text: The dumb creature keeps his grip. MARY has to appease to him. She
text: grasps his hand and shakes vigorously. When he finally lets go, she
text: aims her PISTOL again and FIRES AT THE VEST SEVERAL MORE TIMES.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Look. It's good to shoot the circles. Good.
dialog: Good.
text: THE ZOMBIES are confused. Exasperated, MARY tears off her own vest
text: and tosses it down the alley. THE RED COATS look befuddled, and a
text: little angry. MARY FIRES at the vest she threw down. TWO BULLETS HIT
text: IT before MARY'S PISTOL CLICKS...empty.
text: There's A POUNDING AT THE DOOR. It's RHODES AND HIS TROOP.
text: Suddenly BUB steps into position. WHAP! One of his famous quick
text: draws! BLAM!!! HE FIRES. THE VEST ON THE FLOOR, MARY'S VEST, IS HIT.
text: BUB FIRES AGAIN, the other gun this time. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS
text: HIT squarely in the center of its orange circle.
text: TONTO now turns. He lifts his PISTOL and FIRES. THE VEST ON THE
text: TARGET IS HIT AGAIN, off center, but hit.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT!
text: Suddenly THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE RANGE FLIES OPEN. THREE OF
text: RHODES' MEN RUSH IN, wearing, of course, orange circles. THE RED
text: COATS OPEN FIRE. THE TROOPERS ARE CUT TO RIBBONS. Others outside the
text: door duck back behind the walls.
text: THE ZOMBIES lumber toward the open doorway, STILL FIRING AS THEY GO.
text: MARY is backing away through the opposite exit. BUB sees her leaving.
text: He calls to her with a deep, pleading moan. MARY stops and looks at
text: him sadly. He shoots off a military salute. MARY salutes him back.
text: There are tears in her eyes.
text: She turns and hurries off. BUB joins his fellows in pursuit of
dialog: Rhodes' and his men.
scene_heading: 153	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
text: A WOMAN'S FACE IS FULL SCREEN. She is screaming in agony as she is
text: TORN APART BY ZOMBIES. The creatures have invaded the gymnasium.
text: They're CLAWING AT THE FAT-CAT COUNCILLORS, MAULING THEIR WOMEN.
text: GASPARILLA AND TWO OTHER MEN are rolling around crazily, bumping into
text: exercise machines, knocking over wine bottles and tables full of
text: hors-d'oeuvres. The single vest they are fighting over rips apart
text: into two pieces, its orange circle severed into two useless halves.
text: GASPARILLA backs across the floor, his blubber bouncing. He has a
text: tattered piece of the vest clutched in his hands. He tries to spread
text: it out on his chest but it's too late... and THE ZOMBIES are too
dialog: hungry...much too hungry.
dialog: MONTAGE: as ALL OVER THE ROOM THEY STRIKE. This is it, gore fans. The
text: gross finale. The intestine-tugger. THE ZOMBIES GET THEIR SUPPER.
text: THEY FEAST AMONG THE PILLOWS, like Romans at an orgy. MUSIC still
text: plays over the gymnasium speakers, rock-a-billy in a gleeful tempo.
text: GASPARILLA has retreated into his tanning-coffin but a pudgy arm and
text: a leg are dangling outside. ZOMBIES CHEW HUNGRILY on the juicy
text: morsels. From inside the coffin, where ultraviolet glows brightly,
text: come the piercing, agonised screams of the fat General.
scene_heading: 154	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT
text: DIESEL guides SPIDER through the huge earthen archways. ZOMBIES here
text: are scattered now, but they provide for delays. DIESEL FIRES and
text: ZOMBIES ARE HIT but few are hit fatally. DIESEL'S free arm can't fire
text: accurately while he's trying to support the walking bomb beside him.
text: DIESEL stops to check his map. A ZOMBIE looms up behind him and takes
text: a HUGE BITE OUT OF HIS SHOULDER. DIESEL screams. He lets go of SPIDER
text: who stumbles away from him, almost falling but saving herself. Her
text: eyes are bugging with pain.
text: DIESEL FIRES POINT BLANK AT THE ZOMBIE, BLOWING ITS HEAD TO BITS.
text: MORE CREATURES are pressing in close. DIESEL bats at one, kicks
text: another, punches a third. Then he rushes to SPIDER'S side and scoops
text: her into his arms again. Wincing in pain from THE BLEEDING WOUND IN
text: HIS SHOULDER he manages to move out of immediate danger.
text: THE ZOMBIES lumber after the two, groaning in chorus as they walk.
scene_heading: 155	INT. THE CORRIDOR AT EXIT FIVE - NIGHT
text: MARY, THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN come charging down the hall. TOBY,
text: SARAH, AND JOHN are waiting for them near the open door which leads
text: out into the jungle. TOBY AND MARY rush into each other's arms and
text: they flee, with the others, out into the night.
scene_heading: 156	INT. A CORRIDOR NEAR THE DORMITORY - NIGHT
text: RHODES AND HIS MEN rush into another corridor where they are met by a
text: crowd of DROOLING ZOMBIES. THE MEN OPEN FIRE but the ZOMBIES are too
text: close in. They get the upper hand.
text: RHODES FIRES HIS MAGNUM, his eyes insane, his face boiling red with
text: disbelief. After TWO SHOTS BLAST OPEN THE HEADS OF THE CLOSEST
text: ZOMBIES, THE MAGNUM just CLICK-CLICK-CLICKS! RHODES is out of lead.
text: He's grabbed by ONE ZOMBIE, then ANOTHER. He fights to free himself
text: but HE'S BITTEN ONCE...TWICE...
text: BLEEDING, he fights on. He struggles to a doorway and pushes through.
scene_heading: 157	INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: RHODES comes face-to-face with...you guessed it...big BUB. THE ZOMBIE
text: faces off, ready to draw those SIX-GUNS that hang at his hips. RHODES
text: turns and runs.
text: WHAP! BUB slaps leather. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! RHODES turns a corner but
text: ONE BULLET BITES HIM ON THE BACK OF HIS SHOULDER. Terrified, fighting
text: pain, he staggers on with the gun-totin' RED COAT following behind.
scene_heading: 158	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT
text: THE REBELS lead MARY, THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN through the
text: underneath. TRICKS is bleeding badly. TOBY helps him along. Suddenly,
text: as they break into a clearing, SARAH stops cold. There on the ground,
text: lying where we last saw it, is THE CORPSE OF MIGUEL.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's...he was...one who came to the island
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Come on. No time.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: He was killed...five days ago.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Maybe...maybe he wasn't dead. Are you sure
dialog: he was dead when you left him?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Look at him. A hundred bullets. You tell
dialog: me. Was he dead?
text: There are tears in SARAH'S eyes.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Five days...and he hasn't...risen. He
dialog: hasn't risen.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Come on. There's no time. There's no time
dialog: to lose.
text: THE GROUP pushes ahead. SARAH kneels. She blesses herself and makes
text: the sign of the cross over the corpse. Then she stands to see that
text: JOHN is waiting for her. He holds out his hand, she takes it and
text: follows the others.
scene_heading: 159	EXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT
text: THE SOLDIERS aboard THE FISHING BOAT hear NOISES coming from the
dialog: surrounding jungle.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: WHO IS IT? WHO'S OUT THERE?
speaker_heading: JOHN (o.s.)
dialog: WE WANT THE BOAT! DROP YER GUNS OR WE'LL
dialog: BLAST YOU!
text: THE SOLDIERS hesitate, looking around at the dark jungle.
speaker_heading: TOBY (o.s.)
dialog: WE GOT YOU SURROUNDED!
text: A SUDDEN BURST OF AUTOMATIC FIRE LIGHTS UP THE BLACK FOLIAGE. THE
text: SOLDIERS react, flinging their WEAPONS over the side into the water.
text: THE REFUGEES spill out of the undergrowth and scramble over to the
text: boat, lifting THE CHILDREN and THE WOUNDED TRICKS on board carefully.
text: JOHN pauses to look back into the jungle.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Damn you, island. Damn you ta Hell and
dialog: worse!
speaker_heading: McDERMOTT
dialog: We ain't outa here yet. Get yer ass movin'
dialog: ya dumb bastard.
text: McDERMOTT tries to slug from his flask, finds it empty. With a shrug
text: he tosses the thing into the backwater. THE ENGINE STARTS as JOHN
text: climbs aboard, SARAH AND TOBY giving him their hands.
scene_heading: 160	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER WITH DIESEL AND SPIDER - NIGHT
scene_heading: 161	INT. THE LABORATORY AREA WITH RHODES AND BUB - NIGHT
dialog: (These two sequences will be intercut for parallel action)
text: ZOMBIES are crawling all over DIESEL now. He fights them off
text: valiantly but his super strength is waning. HE IS BITTEN AGAIN AND
text: AGAIN but he tries to keep himself between THE CLUTCHING CREATURES
text: AND THE LITTLE DEAF MUTE who is stumbling along ahead. She's getting
text: very close to a huge SET OF CONCRETE SLABS...THE DOORS TO THE POWDER
speaker_heading: MAGAZINE.
text: Meanwhile RHODES approaches another corner in the hallway near the
text: Conditioning Room. BUB follows, his boot heels CLICKING the way
dialog: RHODES' own heels once clicked.
text: RHODES dives for the corner. BUB slaps leather and FIRES OFF ALL
text: TWELVE. RHODES rolls on the ground crazily. HE'S HIT SEVERAL
text: TIMES...but he's still alive. He pulls himself, in agony, out of
text: range. Calmly, BUB dumps out his spent shells and starts to reload.
text: IN THE MAIN CHAMBER, DIESEL IS OVERCOME, DRAGGED DOWN BY A MOB OF
text: ZOMBIES. THEY START TO TEAR HIM APART BIT BY BIT.
text: SPIDER walks on alone. She is just a few feet from the POWDER
text: MAGAZINE now. A ZOMBIE grabs her from behind but just gets a handful
text: of shirt. SPIDER reaches forward but the creature holds her back. Her
text: SHIRT IS RUNNING RIVERS OF BLOOD NOW where the vials are implanted
dialog: underneath.
text: RHODES crashes through a doorway into THE CONDITIONING ROOM. He
text: realises, too late, that there's no exit. BUB'S BOOTHEELS are getting
text: LOUDER. RHODES crawls around behind THE TABLES FULL OF TESTING
text: EQUIPMENT, WOODEN SHAPES, FLASH CARDS SCATTER. Over near the LARGE
text: COLOURED SYMBOLS which are mounted on the wall there's A WEAPONS
text: CABINET. RHODES grabs a chair and smashes open the glass.
text: BUB steps into the open doorway, still reloading his PISTOLS. He
text: stands there, a golem, his fingers slowly, calmly working. He drops a
text: shell or two but soon the barrels are filled with fresh loads.
text: RHODES reaches in through the broken glass and pulls out AN
speaker_heading: AUTOMATIC.
text: BUB slaps his PISTOLS back into their HOLSTERS and face off.
text: RHODES lifts the AUTOMATIC...aims...
text: BUB DRAWS! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EACH ONE OF THE TWELVE BULLETS HITS RHODES
text: SOMEWHERE, many of them in the "kill-zones". He screams when the
text: first few rounds hit, but his screaming stops about halfway through
text: the barrage. That's when he dies. His leg bones support his corpse
text: long enough for the last six bullets to reach him. Then, as THE SOUND
text: OF BUB'S GUN ECHOES AWAY down the corridors, RHODES BODY slides down
text: the wall and crumples to the floor in a heap, leaving MUCH OF HIS
text: BLOOD on the ORANGE CIRCLE that's mounted behind him.
text: IN THE MAIN CHAMBER, A ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF SPIDER'S SHOULDER.
text: IT PULLS OUT A BIG CHUNK OF FLESH, AND WITH IT, STUCK IN THE
text: CREATURE'S TEETH, COMES ONE OF THE NITRO VIALS.
text: SEVERAL ZOMBIES are pulling at the woman. She is still reaching for
text: the POWDER MAGAZINE DOORS but the ghouls are pulling her away.
text: THE CREATURE WITH THE TEST TUBE IN ITS MOUTH pulls the bothersome
text: thing out from between its teeth. It studies the vial curiously for a
text: moment, then it tosses it angrily towards SPIDER, toward THE MAGAZINE
dialog: DOOR...
text: KA-BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!
scene_heading: 162	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER (EFX) - NIGHT
text: A HALLACIOUS FIREBALL RIPS THROUGH THE CAVE.
scene_heading: 163	INT. THE CONDITIONING ROOM - NIGHT
text: BUB stands in the open doorway staring at RHODES' still twitching
text: corpse. He slaps his SIX-GUNS back into their leather HOLSTERS, then
text: he shoots off one of those military salutes of his....just as the
text: walls fall in on him.
scene_heading: 164	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
text: THE REFUGEES stare toward the island as A HUGE BOOOOOM FILLS THE
text: NIGHT. Some of the YOUNGER CHILDREN start to cheer as though watching
text: fireworks on the Fourth of July.
scene_heading: 165	EXT. GASPARILLA'S ISLAND (THEIR P.O.V.) - NIGHT
text: THE TOP BLOWS OFF THE ISLAND, just as TOBY predicted is would. It's
text: as though an enormous underground volcano is exploding. It's a
dialog: frightening...yet beautiful sight.
scene_heading: 166	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
text: TOBY looks back over his shoulder. THE NURSE is kneeling beside the
text: body of TRICKS. He's dead. The woman pulls a blanket up over his
text: head. TOBY steps forward, his PISTOL drawn. He pulls the hammer back
text: and aims at TRICKS' head.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. Don't. Wait. Wait to see if... wait
dialog: until it's necessary.
text: TOBY turns and looks at MARY. She nods. He releases the PISTOL HAMMER
dialog: without firing.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 167	EXT. ANOTHER ISLAND (WIDE EST.) - MORNING
text: Gorgeous, a paradise. BIRDSONG fills the air.
scene_heading: 168	EXT. A RIVER ON THE ISLAND - MORNING
text: THE REGUGEES are all gathered. THE CHILDREN walk, one by one, through
text: the shallows as JOHN baptises them. SARAH, MARY AND THE NURSE carry
text: the infants. When the infant in SARAH'S arms has been touched by
text: JOHN'S hand, SARAH doesn't move on. Instead, she looks up into the
text: big man's warm eyes.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Me too...please.
text: JOHN gently cups a handful of river water and pours it on the woman's
dialog: forehead.
text: THE OTHER ADULTS, led by LUKEY, file into the river, all lining up
text: before the baptist, waiting their turns to be blessed into this tiny
dialog: new society.
scene_heading: 169	EXT. A BEACH ON THE ISLAND - MORNING
text: TRICKS' BODY lies covered in the sand. THE REFUGEES are gathered
text: again, heads bowed, while JOHN speaks.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Satan ain't sent this man back. Not yet,
dialog: anyway. So we all hopin' that maybe he's up
dialog: there with you, Lord. This might be the
dialog: first decent soul we been able ta offer ya
dialog: in quite a few years. That's a fact. We

speaker_heading: THE OTHERS
dialog: Amen.
scene_heading: 170	EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT
text: THE CORPSE lies in the MOONLIGHT. NIGHT CRITTERS SCREECH AND BURBLE
text: in the jungle behind the sand. It's an eerie scene.
text: SARAH is sitting up, her RIFLE ready in her lap, watching the body.
text: JOHN steps in behind and she startles.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Just me. I'll take the next shift.
text: He settles easily down beside the woman. The two stare together at
text: the shrouded corpse.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How long do we have to watch him?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta

text: THE BODY lies silent, rigid under the KHAKI ARMY BLANKET that rises
text: and falls, rises and falls with the Gulf breeze.
text: Suddenly...A LOUD MUSIC CHORD! A SUDDEN MOVEMENT!
text: It's the movement of RED LETTERS that spin up off the head of the

speaker_heading: The letters read: "THE END (I PROMISE)"
