scene_heading: INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT
text: Pitch dark. We hear two men speaking FRENCH in hushed voices.
dialog: NOTE: All dialogue is in French until otherwise noted.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Turn on the flashlight.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: I'm trying. It doesn't work.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It has to work. You just bought it this
dialog: afternoon.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Do they come with batteries?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You didn't buy batteries?
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: I thought they came with batteries.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I can't believe you didn't check.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: I bought everything you put on the list.
text: Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight.
dialog: Batteries were not on the list.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why should I have to put it on the list?
dialog: It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: A wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large
text: homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in
text: a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits
dialog: nervously.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Dark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's,
text: tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the
text: flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places
text: the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the
text: wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut
text: the canvas from the frame.
text: Daniel rolls up the canvas.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Let's go.
text: Julien starts to pick up the ZIPPO.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Be careful it's...
text: Too Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans
text: he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner
text: of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: ... hot!
text: Julien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins
text: beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief.
text: Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He
text: turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the
text: fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat.
text: Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at
text: him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- NIGHT
text: A Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it
text: and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE FOYER -- NIGHT
text: Daniel and Julien move through the darkness.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Light your lighter. I can't see
dialog: anything... and try not to burn down
dialog: the house!
text: Julien remove a lighter and presses it. The entire room fills
text: with light. Julien stares at the flame amazed.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Don't move!
text: They turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in
text: his bathrobe. He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a
text: very long, double-barrel shotgun.
text: Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man
text: slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down
text: the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom.
text: Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the
text: floor, motionless.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Is he dead?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: I don't know. He looks dead.
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIEN
text: He looked dead before he fell.
text: The old man groans, then opens his eyes. He grabs his shotgun.
text: Daniel and Julien run to the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Daniel and Julien run towards the street.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Start the car! Start the car!
text: Raymond starts the engine. Daniel and Julien rush across the street
dialog: and get in the back seat.
text: Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between
text: the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck
text: between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PEUGEOT -- CONTINUOUS
text: Daniel and Julien stare angrily ar Raymond.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: You didn't think to move the car before
dialog: we came out!
text: Daniel looks out his window and sees...
text: DANIEL'S POV -- the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun
text: and heads towards the car.
text: Raymond is desperately trying to get the car free. They all slide
text: down as the old man fires. The windows on the left side of the
text: car shatter.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Raymond, get us out of here!
text: Raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man
text: opens the breach of the shotgun to reload..
text: Raymond floors the Peugeot keeping his foot on the brake. The
text: engine revs. He turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake.
text: The Peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the Mercedes
text: and pushing in out into the street. Before the old man can take
text: aim the Peugeot is speeding down the street.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PEUGEOT -- MOVING -- NIGHT
text: Raymond bites his lip nervously as he drives. Julien finds the
text: whole thing amusing. Daniel leans forward.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (to Raymond)
dialog: You know what makes a good get away
dialog: driver?
dialog: (More)
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANIEL (Cont'd)
dialog: (controlled anger)
dialog: Being able to get away!
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: You're always pointing out my negative
dialog: qualities. My analyst says positive
dialog: reinforcement is a much more productive
dialog: way of relating with people.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Fine. Raymond, we'd like to commend you
dialog: on how well you fucked up tonight.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET, PARIS -- DAY
text: A narrow street. Daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks
text: with Julien and Raymond. They enter a WAREHOUSE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BASTALDI'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Two large desks are lined up face to face. One is empty. The
text: other is occupied by LAURANT BASTALDI, 40's, all business. Off to
text: the side is MARCEL BUROT, 40's. Daniel, Julien and Raymond enter.
text: As they approach the desk Daniel glances at Marcel who is staring
text: at him.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: (amused)
dialog: I heard you almost got your ass blown
text: off last night. Some thief. A regular
text: black panther.
text: Marcel glances at Bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: A Black Panther was a member of an African
dialog: American militant group in the sixties,
dialog: Marcel. I think you're referring to The
dialog: Pink Panther.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Pink panther, black panther. Who gives
dialog: a shit? And I don't remember asking you
dialog: a God Damn thing, you little turd.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: There's no reason to be abusive. You're
dialog: projecting your anger on me as a defense
dialog: mechanism.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: What the hell is he talking about?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I'm talking about human beings
text: communicating openly and honestly.
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: How about getting on your knees and
dialog: communicating with my dick?
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: Shut up! Both of you! You're giving me
dialog: a fuckin' headache.
text: A beat. Raymond and Marcel stare at one another. We HEAR a muffled
text: GROANING SOUND in the b.g.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Where's your brother?
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: Vincent's in the States on business.
dialog: (a beat; referring to
dialog: the painting)
dialog: That it?
text: Daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk.
text: Bastaldi removes the painting. To him it is not a work of art,
text: just a commodity to be sold. He opens his desk drawer, removes
text: several large stacks of money and hands them to Daniel.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: Okay. Now I've got something I want to --
text: We HEAR the groaning sound again. Bastaldi looks irritated. He
text: gets up and walks over to a closet. He opens to the doors to reveal
text: a man in his underwear, his wrists tied behind his back, his mouth
text: taped shut. A wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand
text: on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: Do you mind? I'm trying to do some
dialog: business here.
text: The man looks at Bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: One more sound out of you and I'm going
dialog: to cut your fuckin' tongue out.
text: Bastaldi closes the door. Daniel looks at him inquisitively.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: You take someone in. Give them a steady
dialog: job and how do they repay you? By
dialog: claiming to misplace a shipment of your
dialog: merchandise.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Maybe he did misplace it.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: You misplace your car keys. You misplace
dialog: your cell phone.
dialog: (More)
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BASTALDI (Cont'd)
dialog: You do not misplace one hundred and forty
dialog: seven wide-screen TV's!
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Laurant, how long has he been in there?
text: Bastaldi looks puzzled.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: I don't know. What day is today?
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Thursday.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: Is it Thursday already? This week has
text: just shot by.
text: Bastaldi thinks about something for a moment, then...
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: You and your crew speak English, don't
dialog: you?
text: Daniel is still staring at the closet.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: Hey Daniel! Hello?
dialog: (snaps his fingers)
dialog: Do you guys speak English?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Uh, yeah.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: Good. I have a job for you in America.
text: Bastaldi tosses a photo of a middle-aged American couple. He points
text: to a diamond necklace around the woman's neck.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: The Taylors from Chicago. Very rich.
dialog: An acquaintance of mine recently quit
text: working for Mrs. Taylor as an assistant.
dialog: She tells me they keep all their jewelry
text: in a safe in their bedroom.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: It seems like a long way to go for a
dialog: necklace.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Besides, we don't know the city and--
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you
dialog: want to go.
dialog: (More)
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEL (Cont'd)
dialog: He's telling you you're going! And if
dialog: he's telling you you're going to be going
dialog: then you are going to go!
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely
dialog: redundant explanation.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: C'mon, Laurant, America?
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: The job is worth about two million euros.
dialog: Pull this off and you and your crew could
dialog: make some real money, Daniel. You leave
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: They know they don't have a choice.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: We're going to need to find someone who
dialog: knows the city.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: I know someone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NOTRE DAME -- DAY
text: The plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is
text: SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler,
text: dressed in jeans and a "I Love Paris" tee-shirt. He passes a
text: MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet.
text: Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a
text: vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the
text: cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up.
text: Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She
text: zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper
text: catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the
text: cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries
text: to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence.
text: The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag
text: away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the
text: bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely
text: in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and
text: BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets.
text: He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when
dialog: he sees...
text: HIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA: of two police officers moving
text: towards him .
text: He knows he has no more time. He takes off running, disappearing
text: into the crowd.
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAFE -- LATIN QUARTER -- DAY
text: Sami is at the bar. He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the
text: back. Standing in his way is one of Marcel's MEN. Sami turns
text: around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile.
dialog: NOTE: All dialogue is now in English unless otherwise noted.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Going somewhere?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody
dialog: else. If I knew it was you I would have
dialog: never run.
text: A long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: You're probably here for the money I owe
dialog: you.
dialog: (off Marcel's nod)
dialog: I don't have it.
text: Marcel opens the door to the bathroom and pushes Sami inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY
text: Marcel closes the door. He is face to face with Sami.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: You know this is how rumors get started.
text: Marcel punches Sami in the stomach. He drops to his knees. A
text: beat. The door to the bathroom opens and the LARGE MAN peers
text: inside. He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning
dialog: of a sexual act.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Told you.
text: Marcel slams the door then grabs Sami by the ear and yanks him to
text: his feet.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Today's your lucky day, Sami.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: (breathlessly)
dialog: Yeah, I can see that.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Normally I'd be breaking your fingers
dialog: right now, but I'm going to give you a
dialog: chance to make enough to pay me back and
dialog: have some extra for yourself. We have a
dialog: group going to Chicago to do a job.
dialog: You're going with them.
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: You lived there. You know the city.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: I've still got a few legal problems back
dialog: in the States.
text: Marcel glares at him.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: But I'd be... I'd be happy to go.
text: Marcel stares at him with hard expression.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: If you try to leave town I'll know. If
dialog: you manage to leave town I'll find you...
dialog: and the next time we meet in a bathroom
dialog: I'll be cutting you up into little pieces.
text: He hands Sami a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Be at this address at nine o'clock
dialog: tomorrow morning.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAFE -- MORNING
text: Daniel sits with Julien. At the end of the bar Raymond is on the
dialog: pay phone.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (in French)
dialog: Yes, Mama. Yes, I have my vitamins. I
dialog: have everything. Of course I'm coming
dialog: back. I'm not leaving you. I'm only
dialog: going to be gone a few days. I'll call
dialog: you when I get there. Okay? I've got
dialog: to go now.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Mama, I've got to go.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: No, I'm not yelling.
text: Sami enters and walks over to Daniel and Julien.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: I'm Sami. Marcel sent me.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: What is it you do, Sami?
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: You know, a little of this, a little of
dialog: that. I've boosted cars, stole radios,
dialog: run a few scams. Right now I'm into
text: pick-pocketing.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: I see. A master criminal.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel.
dialog: You guys don't want me, I'll be more
text: than happy to leave.
text: The door opens. ZERO enters. No one knows his last name. He is
text: 40's, blonde hair, leather jacket, black pants. Looks more like a
text: rock-star than a criminal. His eyes are flat and there is an
text: intensity about him that is unnerving. Zero casually nods to
text: Daniel. Zero stares at Sami as Daniel leads him over.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (to Sami)
dialog: This is Zero.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Hi. I'm one and this is two, three,
dialog: four and five.
text: Sami laughs at his little joke. The others cringe. One look in
text: Zero's eyes tells Sami what everyone else already knows: This is
text: not someone to fuck with. Julien puts his arm around Sami and
text: leads him away from the others.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Let me give you some advice. You don't
dialog: want to piss him off because he'll kill
dialog: you for the fun of it. What you want to
dialog: do is keep your mouth shut and do what
dialog: we tell you.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: (in French)
dialog: So, we are going to America?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: In English. Sami doesn't speak French.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: Where are you from?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Algeria.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: And you don't speak French?
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Well, you know, not all Algerians speak
dialog: French. It's a matter of what school
dialog: you went too. Me I never really --
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: -- Zero isn't interested in your life
dialog: story.
dialog: (to Daniel)
dialog: Who gets killed?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Hopefully no one.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: (confused)
dialog: No one? Then why is Zero here?
text: Sami leans over to Raymond.
speaker_heading: SAMI
text: He speaks about himself in the third
dialog: person?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Feel free to correct him if you want.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (to Zero)
dialog: I just want you there in case there's
dialog: trouble.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: And if there is, then Zero can kill
dialog: someone?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: We'll see.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAFE -- DAY
text: Daniel and the others step out carrying their suitcases. The door
text: to a limousine opens and Marcel gets out. The scene is in FRENCH.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: (to Daniel)
dialog: I thought I would accompany you to the
dialog: airport to say bon voyage... and tell
dialog: you that Marcel will be going with you.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: This is a considerable move up for you,
dialog: Daniel. The temptation of having so
dialog: much money might be too much for you.
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You don't trust me?
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: I don't trust anyone. You don't get to
dialog: the top of this game by trusting people...
dialog: and after all, you are a thief. It's in
dialog: your nature to steal. I'm just protecting
dialog: my investment.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIMO -- MOVING -- DAY
dialog: For many of them this is the first time they have ever been inside
text: a limo. Julien pours himself a drink. Sami plays around with the
dialog: air conditioner.
text: Zero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he
text: comes to RENAUD singing "Des que le vent souffera." He leans back
text: in his seat, bobbing his head to the music. Marcel doesn't like
text: it. He changes the station. We hear JOHNNY HALLYDAY singing, "Que
dialog: je taime."
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: That's better.
text: Zero doesn't like it. He pushes the button returning to the Renaud
text: song and stares at Marcel. Marcel, not to be outdone returns the
text: Hallyday song. Like two children they click the buttons of the
text: radio, switching back and forth between Renaud and Hallyday.
dialog: Bastaldi has had enough.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: Stop it! Both of you!
text: He turns off the radio. A long beat. Marcel, like a child who
text: has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly, but
text: loud enough for Zero to hear.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: (singing)
dialog: ... que je t'aime... que je...
text: Marcel sees Bastaldi glaring at him and stops.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. O'HARE AIRPORT -- MORNING
text: Daniel and the crew get into a mini-van taxi.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO DRIVING MONTAGE -- MORNING
text: Quick cuts of the familiar sights of the city. The Sears building.
text: Chicago board of trade building. Grant park. Then with each
text: successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are
dialog: in...
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- MORNING
text: An industrial section of the city. Empty streets. Run down
text: buildings. Graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned
text: cars line the street. The taxi driver leans out his window.
speaker_heading: TAXI DRIVER
dialog: Are you sure you guys have the right
dialog: address? This ain't no tourist area.
text: Marcel looks at a piece of paper he is holding.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Yes. We are sure.
text: The taxi speeds off, leaving them standing on the sidewalk, their
text: bags in a pile. Suddenly, from out of nowhere three BLACK TOUGHS
text: appear and walk over. Daniel looks behind him and sees another
text: two approaching from the rear. Zero calmly sits down on one of
text: the suitcases.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Let me handle this.
text: LAMAR, 30's, the leader of the group steps forward.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Hey, brother. What's happening, man?
text: Sami raises his hand as if to greet Lamar.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Don't you brother me, motherfucker.
text: Sami looks like an idiot with his hand up in the air. He casually
text: lowers it. Lamar looks over the group and grins.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: What's in the bags?
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Dirty underwear.
text: Lamar forces a laugh.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Dirty underwear. That's a good one.
dialog: Let me explain something to you. This
dialog: is my street and you're gonna give me
dialog: want I what or I'm gonna bust your heads
dialog: open.
text: Raymond steps forward and places his hand on Lamar's arm.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Lamar, violence is never an answer to
dialog: settling disputes. I can see you have a
dialog: lot of anger... but this is not the way
dialog: to get it out.
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Get outta my face!
text: Lamar removes a knife. The others in his group bring out an
text: assortment of clubs, chains and pipes.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Now, are you going to give me the
dialog: suitcases? Or are we going to have to
dialog: take them?
text: Zero is still sitting on one of the suitcases.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: Va te faire foutre!
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: He said to go fuck yourself.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: We are tired and bored with your bullshit.
dialog: So, put that stupid little knife away
dialog: before Zero shoves it up your ass.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Who is Zero?
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: He is.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (to Julien)
text: He speaks about himself in the third
dialog: person?
text: Julien shrugs his shoulders.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Maybe Zero would like to get off his ass
dialog: and take my knife from me?
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: If you insist.
text: Zero stands up and raises his hand. He is holding a .9mm Glock.
text: He aims it at Lamar's head.
text: Lamar's brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down
text: the barrel of the gun. The rest of his gang turns and runs away.
text: Zero aims the gun at his groin.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: Leave now before Zero shoots off those
dialog: little raisins you call balls.
text: Lamar runs away. Daniel and the others smile at Zero as they pick
text: up their bags and walk towards a building.
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
text: Zero is left with Sami who stares at him with disbelief.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: You put a loaded gun in your bag and
dialog: brought it through customs? How stupid
dialog: is that?
speaker_heading: ZERO
text: Zero did not put it in his bag. He put
dialog: it in yours.
text: Zero grins and walks away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE -- MORNING
text: The crew stands at a door. Marcel knocks. A peep-hole in the
text: door is opened and an eye looks them over.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: We are looking for Sophie. Laurant send
dialog: us.
text: The door is opened by SOPHIE (the girl in the photo on Bastaldi's
text: computer). She is late 20's, beautiful.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Ouh La La.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING
text: An old building, the rooms are partitioned off by sheets hanging
text: from the ceiling. The main area is an artists workspace where
text: large abstract paintings lean against the wall.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I wasn't expecting this many of you.
dialog: I've got a few sleeping bags you can
dialog: use.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Thanks.
text: Of to the side, sitting on the couch is WAYNE, 20's, a burn-out
text: with long hair and a scraggly goatee. His face is buried in a
text: bong as he sucks in a lung full of marijuana. He watches a cartoon
text: show on the television.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (to all of them)
dialog: This is Wayne. My roommate.
text: Raymond walks over to him.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I am Raymond. Thank you for allowing us
dialog: to stay here.
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: No problem, man.

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and
dialog: quite well known in France.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Yeah, I dig him.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Although a cartoon I feel he shares a

dialog: for love. No?
text: Wayne stares at him with a dead pan expression as he tries to

speaker_heading: WAYNE

scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP -- AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Ready to order?
text: Julien looks up at her.
speaker_heading: JULIEN

speaker_heading: WAITRESS

speaker_heading: JULIEN

speaker_heading: SAMI

speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: What kind of restaurant doesn't serve
dialog: wine?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: This kind.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Okay. I will have a beer.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I don't think he's grasping the concept.
dialog: Iced tea, lemonade, coca cola, sprite or

speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: C'est quoi root beer?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: He'll have a sprite. We'll all have

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY -- AFTERNOON
text: Two GANGSTERS stand on each side of Vinny. They are JOEY "TWO
dialog: TONS" 40's, could have a second career as a Sumo Wrestler. NICKY
text: "THE RAKE", 30's, thin a rail. They make a strange pair but they
dialog: both have one thing in common: They are stone cold killers.
text: Standing in front of the them is FRANKIE ZAMMITO, 30's, a wise

speaker_heading: VINNY
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: I'm sorry, Frankie. Really.
text: Vinny gets off his knees and moves towards Zammito.
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: You bleed on me, I'll kill ya.
text: Vinny takes a step back.
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd
dialog: I tell you when you came to me for money?
dialog: Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I
dialog: not say that?
dialog: (to Joey)
dialog: What'd I say to him?
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: You said don't do it, boss.
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: That's right. I said don't do it. Did
dialog: you listen to me? No. You wanted the
dialog: money. So, I lent you twenty large.
dialog: Now it's been three weeks and you ain't
dialog: paid a dime. What do you think that
dialog: makes me look like on the street? I
dialog: don't do something to you and everyone
dialog: will think they can skate.
speaker_heading: VINNY
dialog: Frankie, I --
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me

speaker_heading: VINNY

speaker_heading: ZAMMITO

scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP -- LATER -- AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
text: There's an exterior alarm system. There's

text: The control panel is in the bedroom.
speaker_heading: JULIEN

speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: After the outside alarm is off we go in

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Good. Zero and Julien will go in through
text: the window and disable the motion
dialog: detector. The rest of us will come in
text: through the front door.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: What about transportation?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You can use my car.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Not a good idea. Someone gets a license

dialog: Raymond, you'll steal one.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: When do we go?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE

scene_heading: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON
text: As the enter the music is even louder. The bass pounds through

text: smoking a joint.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Neighbors. They do this all the time.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: I can't even hear myself think.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: How are we supposed to sleep with this

speaker_heading: SOPHIE

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I will talk to them.
text: Sophie and Wayne both find his offer amusing.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Yeah. Right.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Not a good idea.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: It's just a matter of communication.
text: Raymond leaves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON
text: Raymond walks towards a door at the end of the building. The MUSIC
text: grows louder. He KNOCKS on the door and waits. It is opened by a
text: very large man... a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several
text: long earrings hanging from his ear. He is holding a BEER BOTTLE.
text: Behind him are two other rough-looking men.
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (cheerfully; loudly
dialog: over the music)
dialog: Hello. My name is Raymond. I am visiting

dialog: could make your music a little less loud.
text: The Biker takes a sip of his beer.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: But the music is very--
text: Before Raymond can finish his sentence the Biker pours his beer
text: over Raymond's head.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Fuck off!
text: He slams the door in Raymond's face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON
text: The music continues to pound through the walls. A soggy Raymond
text: steps into the room. He walks over to a chair and sits down, his
text: head hung down, embarrassed. Marcel is angered by this. He glances
text: over to Daniel who subtly nods to him. Marcel leaves the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON
text: Marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building. He
text: reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves.
text: He slips them on as he approaches the door, then knocks. A beat.
text: The Biker opens the door.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Listen asshole, I told you --
text: Marcel head butts him, slamming his forehead into the bridge of
text: his nose. The Biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose.
text: Marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several
text: times -- each punch backing the Biker into the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BIKER'S WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: On the last punch the Biker falls backwards crashing through a
text: large glass coffee table.
text: BIKER #2 moves in behind Marcel and throws a hard punch as Marcel
text: turns around. Marcel bends his head down, so that his attackers
text: fists slams into the hard crown of his skull.
text: BIKER #2 painfully grabs his broken knuckles. Marcel knees him
text: hard in the groin. BIKER #2 turns to his side and doubles over.
text: Marcel kicks the man into the back of his knee spinning him around
text: and down on his knees.
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
text: In a fluid movement he elbows the man in the back of head . BIKER
text: #2 falls face forwards and is out cold.
text: Marcel turns to the third BIKER who is standing by the stereo. He
text: is smaller than the others and has seen enough. He quickly turns
text: off the power. DEAD QUIET.

scene_heading: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: Okay. I understand you're interested in
dialog: one of our properties?
speaker_heading: BOBBY BEANS
dialog: Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant

dialog: this quarter will be supernumerary due
dialog: to the --
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: -- Super what?
speaker_heading: BOBBY BEANS
dialog: Supernumerary. It means better than

speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: Then why not just fuckin' say better

dialog: better than expected means.
speaker_heading: BOBBY BEANS
dialog: I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance

speaker_heading: BOBBY BEANS

speaker_heading: ZAMMITO

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You like shoes?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: No, I like the bag. It would be good
dialog: for the job tonight.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: So, how did you get hooked up with these

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Just lucky I guess. How'd you start
dialog: working for the Bastaldi's?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: The art world doesn't fully appreciate
dialog: my talent yet. I needed some way to pay
dialog: the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well
dialog: for information.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: So you arranged to have the people you
dialog: worked for robbed?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: They're not nice people.
text: She sees a TATTOO on Sami's arm. It's a heart with someone's faded
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I like your tattoo.
text: Sami is suddenly self-conscious of it. She traces along the letters
text: with her finger.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: (reading the name)
dialog: Casandra. Old girlfriend?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Did she break your heart?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: It looks old. Did you get it a long
dialog: time ago?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: You ask a lot of questions.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: That's how you get to know someone. Did
dialog: it hurt when you got it?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: I don't remember. I was drunk.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You got it in a bar?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: No. I got it in prison. I went in for

speaker_heading: SAMI

speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: BONANNO
dialog: But you were there?
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: Angelo, we live and die by the rules we

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: The lights are on. The room is an interior designers nightmare.
text: Clashing colors, zebra skin bedspread. We move along Daniel, Sami,
text: Marcel, Julien and Zero as they stare at something.
text: THEIR POV -- Tied to a chair, his mouth taped shut, is a very angry
text: Frankie Zammito. He yells, his voice muffled by the tape, but
text: it's not hard to understand what he's saying.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So much for no one being home.
text: Julien goes to a bookcase and finds the safe.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: At least they got this right.
text: He removes his tools and goes to work. Sami stares at Zammito
text: with vague recognition, then turns to the others.
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: We've got to be careful not to use our
dialog: real names while we're in here.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Good idea.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: I'll be Elvis and you--
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: -- I want to be Elvis.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: It's my idea.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: (whining)
dialog: C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Okay. You can be Elvis.
text: Marcel smiles happily.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: And the rest of us are... John, Paul,
dialog: George and Ringo.
text: Marcel sees an autographed baseball on the book shelf.
speaker_heading: MARCEL

dialog: 
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: BLACK SCREEN. From inside the safe we see Julien open the door.
text: Daniel and Julien look inside. There are a several stacks of cash,

text: everything and puts it into the bag canvas bag.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Where are the jewels? There aren't any
dialog: jewels.
text: Marcel looks as surprised as they are.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: There has to be.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: I'm telling you I've pulled out everything
text: in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: There must be half a million dollars
dialog: here though.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Marcel, we came here for jewels, remember?
text: Sami moves closer to Zammito, studying his face. He moves over to
text: the dresser where there are several photographs of Zammito with
text: various famous people. Next to the photographs is a plaque that
text: reads: TO FRANCIS ZAMMITO...
text: We can see the color drain from Sami's face. He glances over at
text: Zammito whose eyes are locked on his. Sami grabs Daniel and Marcel
text: and pulls them aside.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: (babbling nervously)
dialog: We have a problem. Problem isn't the
dialog: right word. Dilemma. No that really
dialog: doesn't describe --
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: Do you know who that is?
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Mr. Taylor?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (sensing something
dialog: bad is coming)
dialog: It's not?
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: That's Frankie Zammito. The Under boss
dialog: of the Chicago Mafia.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: (screaming)
text: WE'RE IN THE WRONG HOUSE, YOU FUCKIN'
speaker_heading: IDIOT!
text: A beat. The three of them turn and look at Zammito. The
text: seriousness of the situation finally dawns on Marcel. He moves
text: over to Zammito and rips the tape off his mouth.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Mr. Zammito, there seems to have been a
dialog: big mistake here. May I use your phone?
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: Feel free.
text: Marcel picks up the cordless phone and dials.

speaker_heading: QUICK CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. BASTALDI'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEL (Cont'd)

dialog: You're there now?
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI

dialog: You've already robbed the safe?
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Oui.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI (V.O.)
dialog: (in French)
dialog: Take what you've got and get out of there.
text: Bastaldi hangs up. The line goes dead.
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: Walk out of here with nothing and I'll
dialog: forget this ever happened.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Yeah. Right. You're not a vendetta
dialog: kind of guy.
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: I'll find you. No matter where you go
dialog: I'll find you.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You don't carry the same weight in France
dialog: as you do here.
text: Marcel whispers into Daniel's ear.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: You think it's smart to tell him we're
dialog: French?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I think he's already figured that out.
text: Zero who has been standing quietly by the window sees something
text: across the street. A flash. Light reflecting off glass. He takes
text: a pair of night vision binoculars out of one of the bags and looks
text: out the window.
text: ZERO'S POV -- of Agent Hadley and the other FBI Agent watching
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: We are being watched.
text: Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Cops?
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: FBI. They've been there for months.
dialog: Think I don't know. Morons.
text: Daniel closes the curtains. He tries to think. The crew huddles
text: together in the corner, speaking softly so Zammito can't hear them.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: What do we do?
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: I was told to take what we have and go.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Go where? The police are outside.
text: Daniel looks at the others.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: If we do this we all have to agree.
text: Marcel and Zero nod. Daniel looks to Julien who appears indecisive.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: I don't know. Maybe if we did just leave --
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: C'mon, get real, will you. You think
dialog: he's just going to forget about this?
dialog: These guys are all about respect. All
dialog: about honor. He's coming after us, so
dialog: we might as well take the money.
text: Julien nods. Sami walks over and grabs the black canvas bag.
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: You're all dead.
text: Zero grins then tapes his mouth closed again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: The crew goes out the back door and climb over a fence.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
text: The Impala pulls into a driveway and goes to the rear of the
text: building, out of view from the street.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SOPHIE'S FRONT DOOR -- NIGHT
text: The crew waits as the door is unlocked. Wayne opens the door in a
text: stoned haze.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
text: The crew places their equipment on the table.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (V.O.)
dialog: Wayne, who is it?
text: She enters and appears surprised to see them.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I wasn't expecting you guys back so fast.
dialog: How'd it go?
text: She quickly notices their angry expressions.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: How'd it go? I don't know. Daniel, how
dialog: would you say it went?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I would have to say... pretty fuckin'
dialog: bad. You gave us the wrong address
dialog: Sophie.
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: No, I didn't.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: And he gave it to us. 145 Ridgeway Road.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: No. 145 Ridgeroad Way.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: That moron.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway...
dialog: Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Everyone get some sleep. We're leaving

scene_heading: INT. SURVEILLANCE HOUSE -- NIGHT

scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: What the hell are they doing in there?
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
dialog: Chicago P.D. says they can't hold the
dialog: units here any longer. They want to

scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY

scene_heading: INT. JOEY TWO TONS BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Joey "Two Tons" is asleep in a sleeveless tee shirt. Next to him
text: is his wife, her hair in curlers, her eyes covered by a black sleep
text: mask. The phone rings. Joey answers it.
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: Yeah?
text: We hear Zammito's muffled cries for help. It almost sounds like
text: someone moaning during a sexual act. Joey is surprised at first,
text: then glances over at his wife to make sure she is asleep. He slides
text: his hand under the covers and closes his eyes.
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Hmmm.... Oh yeah... Uh huh
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: Zammito stops as he begins to realize what Joey is doing on the
text: other end of the line. He grimaces, then shouts louder.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOEY TWO TONS BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: Joey is really going to town now as his hand moves slowly under
text: the covers. We hear a loud scream on the phone.
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: That's right baby, give it to papa Joey.
dialog: He is really deep into his fantasy world when...
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS" WIFE
dialog: Joey, who is that?
text: Joey sits up quickly.
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: (loudly; for his wife's
dialog: sake)
dialog: -- And don't call here again, you pervert.
text: He slams the phone down. A long beat. It rings again. This time
text: he checks his caller ID and sees that call is coming from Zammito's
dialog: house.
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: Yeah boss?
text: Again we hear the same muffled cries.
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: Boss?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BODY SHOP -- NIGHT

dialog: with low rider cars.
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
text: Working under the hood of a car is FELIX, 30's, sleazy. Raphael
text: walks over and slams the hood down, pinning Felix's upper body and
text: squishing his face between the hood and engine.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: Someone stole my car tonight!
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: C'mon Raphael, you don't think that I
dialog: would steal your car?
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: You run a chop shop for low riders.
dialog: Yes, I think you'd steal my car.
text: Raphael lifts up the hood and slams it down on Felix again.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: I swear I didn't. I wouldn't!
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: And I should just believe--
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (overlapping; to Felix)
dialog: -- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: (to Hector)
dialog: Hector, don't interrupt me.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: He told Enrique he didn't know anything
dialog: about his car.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: I don't give a shit about your cousin's
dialog: car. We're here about my car. So, shut
dialog: your mouth! You think you can do that?
dialog: You think you can keep your big mouth
dialog: shut?
text: Hector is embarrassed as Raphael once again berates him in front
text: of the others. Raphael picks up a pair of pliers of the workbench.
text: He clamps them down on the tip of Felix's nose and squeezes.
text: Felix's face fills with pain.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: If I find out you're lying. If I find
dialog: out you know anything about this I'm
dialog: going to come back and cut off your nose.
text: He gives the pliers one last squeeze, then releases Felix.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL

speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: They were all French guys.
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: French guys? You mean like from France?
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO

scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: What'd they take?
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: Everything.
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: Everything?
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: Everything.
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"

speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: Well, you know, when five guys break
dialog: into my house in the middle of the night,
text: stick guns in my face, tie me up and
dialog: steal from me... it does irritate me.
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: Well, I must say you're handling it very
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: You know why I'm handling it very well?
dialog: Because you're going to get these guys
dialog: for me.
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"
dialog: Okay boss. Where are they?
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: If I knew where they were you wouldn't
dialog: have to find them, would you?
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"

speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: Just find them!
scene_heading: JOEY "TWO TONS"

scene_heading: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Sami can't sleep. He walks over to the table and sorts through
text: the canvas bag containing the contents of Zammito's safe. Inside
text: a small cardboard box he finds several cassette tapes. He removes
text: the box and walks to the stereo system on the floor, then inserts
text: a tape into the cassette deck. A moment later Sophie enters.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Can't sleep?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: It's not your fault.
text: She notices the box of tapes.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes.
dialog: See what's so important that a mob guy
text: has to lock it away in his safe.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Sounds boring.
speaker_heading: SAMI
text: It's three in the morning. Not much
dialog: else to do.
text: She grins seductively, then leans in towards him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I can think of something.
text: They kiss.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING
text: Sami is asleep on the floor, curled up under several blankets. He
text: wakes up and looks to his side expecting to find Sophie. She is
text: not there. Sami looks around for her.
text: Wayne is sitting on the couch preparing his morning joint.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: She's not here, man.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I think she went to do some laundry.
text: Threw some stuff in a bag and left.
text: It takes a moment for Sami to connect the thoughts.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Bag?
text: Sami runs to the table. The black canvas bag is gone.
text: CLOSE ON DANIEL: Asleep. Sami shakes him. He opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Get up. We've been ripped off!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Daniel and Sami are with the crew. They are not a happy bunch.
text: Wayne is smoking his joint, his eyes locked on the television.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: Oh, man... this is bullshit! You can't
dialog: trust anyone these days.
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: She took everything! Didn't even leave
dialog: us cab fare.
text: A thought occurs to Sami.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Not everything.
text: He removes the tape he put in the cassette deck last night before
dialog: Sophie entered.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: I was going to listen to it last night
dialog: but I --
text: He realizes it may not be the time to tell them what happened.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: -- feel asleep.
text: Wayne blurts out a sloppy laugh.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: No you didn't, dude. You were bangin'
dialog: Sophie. I saw you guys going at it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You slept with her?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Well, actually I would say she slept
dialog: with me.
text: Daniel stares at him angrily.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: What's the big deal? It's not like I
dialog: was on guard duty or something.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You didn't think it was little suspicious
dialog: that someone you only knew for a few
dialog: hours wanted to sleep with you?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: No. Chicks dig me.
text: Daniel grabs the cassette and puts it in the player. On the tape
text: we hear a phone ringing.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO'S VOICE
dialog: It's me. I need an answer from you if
dialog: I'm going to move.
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of
dialog: work' here. We're talking about a boss.
text: Sami is the first to realize what he is hearing.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Holy shit.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: What?
text: Sami holds his hand signaling them to be quiet so he can hear the
dialog: rest.
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO'S VOICE
dialog: Bonanno's a dinosaur. Guy thinks he's
dialog: fuckin' Vito Corleone or something. The
dialog: old ways are gone. If we don't change
dialog: now we're going to get pushed out. I
dialog: need to know if I can count on your
dialog: support?
text: A pause on the line.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Yeah.
text: The line goes dead. Sami leans back.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk
dialog: out with this stuff. He's planning on
dialog: killing Bonanno and taking over the
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: This wasn't the deal! The deal was to
dialog: steal a necklace, not get in the middle
dialog: of a Mafia war.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says
dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You know, if you could get your nose out
dialog: of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you
dialog: might see what's going on around you.
speaker_heading: JULIEN
dialog: I knew this was a mistake! I knew it
dialog: last night when you asked me to go along
dialog: with this. I could hear that little
dialog: voice in my head saying, "don't do it!
dialog: Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I
dialog: ever listen to myself?
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Yeah, but you did do it. So let's deal
dialog: with that.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: What are you guys so scared of? Zammito
dialog: doesn't know who we are. We just get
text: out of town and it's over.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: Oh, you think it's that easy?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Yeah. We just go home.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: We can't.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the
text: airport and get on a plane.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You steal some money from a man he gets
dialog: over it in time. But these tapes. He's
dialog: never going to stop looking for us.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: We have to find Sophie.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: How are we going to do that?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I know where she went.
text: They all look over at him as he takes a huge hit off his joint.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I heard her talking on the phone. Bay
text: View Motel. It's about five blocks from

speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Wait here.

scene_heading: INT. OFFICE -- BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING
text: Sami enters. Behind the counter is the MOTEL CLERK, middle-aged,
text: balding.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Hi. Did a woman just check in? She's
text: about five six. Pretty. Dark hair.
speaker_heading: MOTEL CLERK
dialog: I can't give out information on our
dialog: guests.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: C'mon man, I think she's having an affair.
speaker_heading: MOTEL CLERK
dialog: So are half the people in this place. I
dialog: can't help you, pal.
text: Sami nods and walks outside. Through the window we see him talking
text: with the others. A beat. Sami steps back inside with Zero.
speaker_heading: MOTEL CLERK
dialog: Look, I can't tell you --
text: Before he can finish the sentence Zero has his gun out and wedged
text: under the clerks jaw.

speaker_heading: MOTEL CLERK

speaker_heading: ZERO

scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
text: Sami pushes her onto the bed.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: I really thought we had something special
dialog: going. I can't tell you what a
dialog: disappointment you've turned out to be.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: After last night I could say the same
dialog: for you.
text: Sami feigns a smile. Zero checks the bathroom to make sure she is
text: alone. He looks at Daniel and shake his head. Raymond finds the
text: black canvas bag on the dresser and checks the contents.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: The money isn't here.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Where is it, Sophie?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: If you think because you're a women this
dialog: can't go hard on you, think again.
text: She stares at them defiantly.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Who are you waiting for?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Stick around and find out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM -- LATER -- MORNING
text: A knock on the door. Sami clamps his hand over Sophie's mouth
text: just in case she gets any stupid ideas. Daniel opens the door.
text: Agent Hadley steps in, stares at Daniel, then feels the barrel of
text: Zero's gun pressed against his head.
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
text: Hadley steps into the room. Daniel closes the door. Zero searches
text: him. Finds a gun which he gives to Daniel, then a wallet. He
text: opens it and sees his FBI identification.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: He's FBI.
text: Zero knowingly bends down and removes Hadley's backup gun which is
text: strapped to his ankle. He gives the gun to Sami.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: What is she doing with an agent du FBI?
text: Sami looks at her -- at Hadley -- at the black canvas bag. Slowly
text: it starts to come together in his mind.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: We've been set up.
text: He stares at Sophie angrily.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: We didn't go to the wrong house. We
dialog: went to right one, didn't we Sophie?
text: Her expression gives away nothing.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: They send us to Zammito's house. The
text: FBI is right across the street watching
text: the whole thing, but they don't move. A
text: crime is going down and they don't move.
dialog: Why?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Because they were waiting for us to come
dialog: out so they could arrest us.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: What does arresting us get them?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: (to Hadley)
dialog: You wanna tell him?
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: You're telling it fine.
text: Daniel motions to Zero.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You see my friend over there? I nod to
dialog: him and he's going to put a bullet in
dialog: your knee.
text: Zero stares at Hadley, just waiting for Daniel to give him the go
dialog: ahead.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: You wouldn't.
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
text: Daniel nods. Zero aims his gun at Hadley's knee cap.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: That's going to make a lot of noise.
dialog: Not much time for a conversation after
dialog: you pull the trigger.
dialog: They know he's right.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: He's got a point.
text: Sami lifts up a heavy brass lamp from the nightstand. He pulls
text: the electrical cord out of the base, then touches two wires
text: together. They spark. Before Hadley can say a word Sami touches
text: them to his hand. Hadley's body jerks violent as he screams.
text: Sami removes the wires. Hadley winces in pain from the burn mark
text: on his hand.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: Okay! Okay! We've been investigating
dialog: Zammito for years, but we've never had
dialog: enough evidence for a warrant to search
dialog: his house. We got word through a snitch
dialog: that Zammito was planning on taking
dialog: Bonanno out.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: We know all this.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: You just don't take out a boss. You
dialog: need permission from the other families
dialog: to do something like that. Our informant
dialog: told us that Zammito was talking with
dialog: other bosses and recording their
dialog: conversations in case they later claimed
dialog: they weren't involved. Look at these
dialog: tapes. The guy has recorded every
dialog: conversation he's had for years.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So we rob Zammito. You arrest us when
dialog: we come out and the contents of the safe
dialog: is now evidence which you can use against
dialog: him.
text: Agent Hadley nods.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: (to Sophie)
dialog: What are you getting out of this?
dialog: There is no point in hiding anything now.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Money. It was supposed to simple. In
dialog: and out.
dialog: (More)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (Cont'd)

speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: Of course, Mr. Zammito.
text: Zammito leaves. Through the window we see Joey "Two Tons" open
text: the door to the car. Zammito and Joey get in and drive away. A

speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
text: Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Laurant and Vincent were in business
dialog: with Zammito.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What kind of business?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Black market art. Zammito got to a few
text: key security guards at the Metropolitan
dialog: Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the
dialog: artists to make copies of famous works.
dialog: They'd switch the paintings, send the
dialog: originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's
dialog: would sell them to private collectors.
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet.
dialog: We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's
dialog: "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week
dialog: with a copy. It was on loan from the
dialog: London National Gallery and they're not
dialog: going to be very happy when they find
dialog: out about it.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds
dialog: to trade up for his brother?
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito.
dialog: If we got what we wanted we'd let his
dialog: brother go providing he tells us where
dialog: the Van Gogh and the other paintings
dialog: are.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: No one has mentioned the part of the
dialog: plan about us getting caught and going
dialog: to prison.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: You walk out with that bag and you won't
dialog: only have Zammito and his people after
dialog: you. You'll have the entire United States
dialog: justice department. How far do you think
dialog: you'll get? I know who you are Mr. Foray?
dialog: Mr. Zerhouni. Mr. Gayet.
dialog: (looks at Zero)
dialog: Mr...
text: Agent Hadley looks to Sophie.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE

scene_heading: EXT. BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: You want Zero to kill him?
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'm going to kill him myself!
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: What about the money?
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't
dialog: have time to go anywhere else before she
dialog: came here.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: We don't know that for sure.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Forget the money! We've got bigger
dialog: problems than the money right now.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: She probably hid it at her place. The
dialog: six of us could find it in --
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: -- We don't have time to look for it.
dialog: Hadley's first move is going to be to
dialog: look for us there.
text: Daniel dials a number on his cell phone.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: We're moving. Pack up and be on the

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
text: Agent Hadley steps out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around the
text: burn on his hand.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: This is turning to shit. If word gets
dialog: out of my involvement in this I'll go to
dialog: prison.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Listen, we know their names. They don't
dialog: know the city. You'll find them. You're
dialog: the FBI.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: I can't bring the Bureau into this. If
dialog: I do the tapes become evidence.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: They're supposed to be evidence. That's
dialog: why Bastaldi set this up.
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These
dialog: tapes are gold. Do you have any idea
dialog: what Zammito would pay to get them back?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I thought you wanted Zammito?
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: What for? The minute I get him some
dialog: other Gavone will take his place. I've
dialog: been doing this for twenty years. When
dialog: I retire it's not going to be to some
text: trailer park in the suburbs.
text: She likes the idea. Already she's thinking how she can work her
dialog: way into this.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: Too many people know about my involvement
dialog: in this.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Then we just have to make sure everyone
dialog: who knows can't say anything.
text: His jaw tightens.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: You're right about that.
text: Hadley is standing behind her. He lifts up the brass lamp with
text: his towel and swings down hard towards Sophie's head.

scene_heading: EXT. STREET, SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING

dialog: possible?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I've got a way with people.
speaker_heading: LAMAR

dialog: You're French ain't ya?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'm from Belgium.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was
dialog: you. You know Zammito just put his own
dialog: brother in the hospital? Broke his arm
dialog: cause he was late on a debt. I mention
dialog: this to illustrate the kind of people
dialog: who are lookin' for you.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why haven't you turned us in?
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: I ain't no rat.

dialog: You got money, right?
text: Daniel nods.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: A thousand dollars?
speaker_heading: DANIEL

speaker_heading: WAYNE

scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: They left about a half hour ago.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: Where did they go?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I dunno.

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Hey man, you can't do that!
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: What? This?

scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Jesus. What kind of FBI agent are you?
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now,

dialog: you, it's important that I believe you
dialog: and right now I don't. So tell me, where
dialog: did they go?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I swear man, I don't know. They packed
dialog: up and left a half hour ago.
dialog: (points to coffee
dialog: table)
dialog: All I got is one of their phone numbers

speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You're sure?
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: I think if he told me he was going to

dialog: I would remember it.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: (correcting him)
dialog: "Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Whatever! He never told me about the

text: Raymond hangs up the phone and joins the others.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: It makes sense. I mean, do you really

speaker_heading: DANIEL

dialog: told him to.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Fuck you! You know I'd never go along
dialog: with something like this.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Do I?
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: This ain't about that and you know it.
dialog: This is about you never forgiving me for

speaker_heading: SAMI

speaker_heading: BONANNO
dialog: What is happening with the world? There

dialog: thinks he can get away with something.
dialog: What did they take?
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I
dialog: can replace, but there's a cardboard

dialog: only ones I have of her.
speaker_heading: BONANNO
dialog: We're doing everything we can to find

text: An old building that has seen better days. Daniel and Zero get

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -- BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING

text: past them, her smile signaling she is open for business. They
text: arrive at room 211 and knock. The door is opened by a very large

speaker_heading: BLACK GUY
dialog: (very loud)
dialog: I'm gonna have to search you.
speaker_heading: DANIEL

text: in his waistband.
speaker_heading: BLACK GUY
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: You can't come in here with that.
text: Daniel looks past him to Ellwood.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What's wrong with this guy?
speaker_heading: ELLWOOD
dialog: He's my cousin. He's deaf.
text: Daniel removes an envelope full of cash.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: We're here to buy, not steal. If you
dialog: guys are straight there's not going to
dialog: be a problem.

speaker_heading: ELLWOOD
dialog: A grand a piece.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'll need extra clips and ammo.

text: he's been holding behind the open suitcase at them.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: What the hell you doing, Ellwood? I
dialog: gave them my word.
speaker_heading: ELLWOOD
dialog: Zammito's offering twenty grand a head
dialog: for these guys. You think I'm going to
dialog: settle for four G's when I can make forty?
dialog: (to Daniel)
dialog: All right. Reach in easy and put the
text: gun on the floor.
text: Daniel slowly grabs his gun and places it on the floor, then kicks
text: it under the bed.
speaker_heading: ELLWOOD
dialog: I said put it on the floor, not kick it
text: under the bed.
text: Ellwood speaks to his cousin, speaking slowly and enunciating each
text: word so he can read his lips.
speaker_heading: ELLWOOD
dialog: Get that and add it to my inventory.
text: The black guy get on his hands and knees and starts looking for
text: the gun under the bed. As he does Daniel glances over at Zero
text: with a look. Ellwood aims his gun at Zero.
speaker_heading: ELLWOOD
dialog: I assume you're carrying too?
text: Zero opens his coat and reveals his .9mm.
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLWOOD
dialog: Okay, put it on the floor... and do not
dialog: kick it under the fuckin' bed.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: No.
text: He stares at Ellwood calmly through dead, flat eyes.
speaker_heading: ELLWOOD
dialog: No? Did you just say no? Listen cowboy,
dialog: if you're thinking about makin' a move,
dialog: don't. Nobody is that fast.
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: Zero is.
speaker_heading: ELLWOOD
dialog: Who's Zero?
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: He is.
text: Ellwood is confused. Daniel bolts to his left. Ellwood's eyes
text: leave Lamar for a moment -- it's a moment too long. In a blur of
text: movement Zero has his gun out and fires one shot into Ellwood's
dialog: forehead.
text: Ellwood slumps down on the bed, dead. The black guy who has heard
text: nothing continues searching under the bed. Zero casually picks up
text: the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to Daniel. They walk
text: out of the room. Lamar stands there, stunned, then quickly runs
dialog: after them.
text: A beat. The black guy pops up with Daniel's gun oblivious to what
text: has transpired in the room.
speaker_heading: BLACK GUY
dialog: Found it!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING
text: Daniel pushes Lamar out the door. Zero steps out behind him. He
text: stares at Lamar for a long moment, then hands him the envelope.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: There's ten grand in here. It's yours.
dialog: I'm going to call you again. There's
dialog: one more thing I need you to do.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'll tell you when it's time.

dialog: You're making a big mistake. I'm an FBI
dialog: agent.
text: Hadley stares at Lamar defiantly. Lamar cocks the hammer back on
text: his gun and presses the barrel to Hadley's forehead. Hadley drops
text: the canvas bag.
text: Lamar picks up the canvas bag and runs away. Hadley stands there
text: fuming. Lamar runs towards the statue and disappears behind it.
scene_heading: ANGLE -- BEHIND THE STATUE
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
text: Daniel is waiting, holding the other black canvas bag. As Lamar
text: passes they quickly exchange bags.
text: From Hadley's point of view Lamar has merely run behind the statue
text: as he heads for the street. Lamar runs a few more steps, then
text: stumbles and falls... several cassette tapes spill out of it.
text: Lamar's buddies are already at the street.
speaker_heading: LAMAR'S BUDDIES
dialog: C'mon, man! Let's get out of here.
text: Lamar gets up, looks at the bag, pretends to be panicked. He runs
text: off leaving the bag laying on the grass.
text: ON HADLEY: He can't believe his luck. He runs over, picks up the
text: loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag, then leaves.
text: ON DANIEL: he peers out from behind the fountain, watching as
text: Hadley walks off in the other direction.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER -- MORNING

speaker_heading: SAMI

speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Okay, we're square now, right?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: There's just one more thing I need you

text: Lamar is about to protest when Daniel takes out a roll of bills.
speaker_heading: LAMAR

scene_heading: INT. TAXI -- MOVING -- DAY

speaker_heading: DANIEL

scene_heading: INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- DAY

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: This came for you.
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HADLEY'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Hadley opens the package and finds a video cassette. Hadley pops
text: the cassette into the VCR. On the screen we see Sami speaking
text: into a video camera.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Since we're such good pals I thought I'd
dialog: sneak you an advanced copy of my latest
dialog: work. I call it, "I am a scum-sucking
dialog: FBI agent".
text: On the television screen we see Hadley and Sami in the park on
dialog: their first meeting.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: You want the tapes for yourself. You're
dialog: going to sell them.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: I'm going to retire with a shit-load of
dialog: money. Find me a small country that
dialog: doesn't have an extradition treaty with
dialog: the States and live the good life.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: You didn't have to kill Sophie.
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: Yes I did. Lose ends are messy.
text: The color drains from Hadley's face. Sami reappears, talking into
text: the camera again.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: It's a little arty I know, but it has
dialog: great content, don't you think? You
dialog: were so busy looking for a wire you
dialog: probably didn't even think about a video
dialog: camera. It was on the statue. Anyway,
dialog: I've sent a copy of the whole tape to
dialog: the Chicago P.D. and the FBI. They'll
dialog: get it tomorrow. If I were you I'd take
dialog: the day off.
text: The tape turns to static. Hadley tries to think. He takes the
text: VHS tape from the machine, then picks up his phone and starts to
text: dial a number. A beat. He thinks better of it, hangs up and uses
text: his cell phone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- DAY

scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY

speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: How'd you get these?
scene_heading: AGENT HADLEY
dialog: I got 'em. That's all you need to know.

speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
text: Just a second.
text: Zammito picks a tape and tosses it to Joey "Two Tons." Who puts
text: the cassette into the cars cassette player. Suddenly we hear Wayne
dialog: Newton singing "Danke Schoen."
scene_heading: WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE
dialog: Danke Schoen, darling Danke Schoen.
dialog: Thank you for all the joy and pain...
text: Hadley's face turns white. He produces an audible gulp as he looks

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MERCHANT STREET WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: The music continues as we hold on a wide shot of the building.
scene_heading: WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE

text: Outside we hear the sound of cars pulling up and screeching to a

text: GANG MEMBERS step inside. The room falls silent, except for Dino
text: on the jukebox. Zammito stands up.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
dialog: Anybody know about that car outside?
speaker_heading: ZAMMITO
dialog: Yeah. It's mine.
speaker_heading: RAPHAEL

text: They are right on the edge of having a major disaster. The Dean
text: Martin song ends. Dead quiet. Each group watches the other to
dialog: see who's going to make the first move.
text: The jukebox selects another record. The needle scratches against

dialog: Scusami".
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
text: -- Raphael's eyes burn into Zammito's

dialog: 
text: At the bar Eddie reaches behind for something without looking. He

text: is enough to push things over the edge.
scene_heading: JERRY VALE'S VOICE
dialog: My love, forgive me...
text: Raphael goes for his gun. All hell breaks loose! People dive for

scene_heading: JERRY VALE'S VOICE
dialog: I didn't mean to have it end like this...
text: Eddie lifts a shotgun from behind the bar and blows away a gang
text: member. Another gang member kills him.
text: It's a massacre! Bodies drop like flies. The room is so thick
text: with smoke you can't see two feet in front of you. Finally it is
dialog: quiet.
scene_heading: JERRY VALE'S VOICE
dialog: I didn't mean to have you fall in love,
dialog: in love with me...

text: covers the floor. Raphael is dead. Along with Joey "Two Tons"
text: and Nicky "The Rake" On the floor, Zammito is against the bar.
text: He sits up, amazed that he is untouched. He gets to his feet and
text: makes his way to the front door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON
text: Music continues. Zammito staggers outside and into the street.

scene_heading: JERRY VALE'S VOICE
dialog: My love, please kiss me...
text: Zammito turns around to see
text: ZAMMITO'S POV -- A Lincoln Town car speeding towards him. Through
text: the windshield he can see the smiling face of Half Tooth Tony.
text: The front of the car slams into Zammito, lifting him into the air.
text: He flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over
text: the car. He lays in the middle of the street, dead.
text: The Lincoln speeds off down the street.

text: BASTALDI POV -- across the street, standing side by side are Daniel,
text: Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero. They look like a ragged bunch,
text: tired, dirty. We PAN across the faces of each one of them as they
text: stare at Bastaldi.
text: A BUS goes by blocking Bastaldi's view of the boys. When it passes
dialog: the crew it gone!
text: Bastaldi bites his lip nervously. Bastaldi looks around, but there
text: is no sign of them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: A DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: We can see the five of them crouched behind a parked car. Marcel
text: peers through the window at Bastaldi who is still trying to figure

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: What's he doing?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEL
text: He's looking around for us.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BASTALDI'S WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: Bastaldi is at his desk, nervously tapping his fingers on the

speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: (in French)
dialog: It's Daniel.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: (in French)
dialog: Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has
dialog: been a big--
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: (overlapping; in French)
dialog: -- I've got the tapes. If you ever want
dialog: to see your brother out of jail do exactly
dialog: what I say. Bring one million euros to
dialog: your boat at six o'clock.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: (in French)
dialog: A million! I don't have that kind of
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: (in French)
dialog: Don't bullshit me, Laurant! I know about
dialog: the Van Gogh.
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: (In French)
dialog: I don't have it. That's why Vincent
dialog: went to Chicago. They arrested him before
dialog: he could bring it back.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: (in French)
dialog: Well, you better get the money somehow.
dialog: Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't
dialog: we'll destroy the tapes.
text: The line goes dead.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON
text: Bastaldi drives up. He gets out carrying a suitcase and nervously
text: walks to the boat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON
text: Bastaldi enters. No one appears to be there. Bastaldi's cell
text: phone rings. He answers it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: (in French)
dialog: Go back on deck. There's a small rowboat
dialog: in the water --
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OTHER SIDE OF RIVER -- CONTINUOUS
text: Daniel, Sami and Zero watch the houseboat. Daniel continues his
text: conversation on the cell phone.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (in French)
text: Put the money in the rowboat and untie
dialog: it. The current will carry it down river.
dialog: When we see that the money is there I'll
dialog: call back and tell you where the tapes
dialog: are.
text: DANIEL'S POV: Bastaldi appears on deck. He puts the suitcase in
text: the rowboat and unties it. It drifts slowly into the current.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DOWN RIVER -- AFTERNOON
text: The rowboat hugs the shore, moving slowly down the river. Marcel
text: is on the shore with Raymond. Raymond reaches out with a long
text: pole and pulls the boat to shore. Marcel opens the case. Inside
text: are several stacks of five hundred franc notes. Marcel looks to
text: Raymond with a grin and nods. Raymond opens his cell phone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OTHER SIDE OF RIVER -- CONTINUOUS
text: Daniel, Sami and Zero continue to watch the houseboat. Sami's

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON
text: Bastaldi's cell phone rings. He answers it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)

dialog: 
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
text: The line goes dead.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON
text: Bastaldi enters, looks around the room until he sees the wooden
text: chest. He walks over and opens it. Inside there are several
text: cassette tapes in the cardboard box.
text: Bastaldi grins and lifts the cardboard box out of the chest. He
text: hears a CLICK. He notices something is attached to the bottom of
text: the cardboard box. It's a long thin wire that has pulled the pin
text: on an electronic device.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- CONTINUOUS
text: Daniel is now holding small, black device. A yellow light starts
text: flashing. He puts his finger on a red button.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: This is for Julien.
text: He presses the button.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT -- CONTINUOUS
text: A digital counter begins counting backwards. Bastaldi realizes
text: that the device is a BOMB. He stares at the numbers quickly speed
dialog: by 8... 7... 6... 5...
speaker_heading: BASTALDI
dialog: Oh, Merde!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- FIVE SECONDS LATER
text: The houseboat explodes in a brilliant fireball, sending pieces of
text: wood and metal flying into the air. A thick plume of black smoke
text: swirls in the wind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- AFTERNOON
text: Daniel, Raymond, Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero watch the smoldering
text: wreckage. Their blank faces show no emotion -- just a sense that
dialog: justice has been done.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Did you have to use that much explosive?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
text: Raymond opens the suitcase and looks inside. As he peels through
text: the stacks of money we see that only the top bill of each stack is
text: real -- underneath them all is white paper, cut to the same size
text: as the bills. Everyone turns to Marcel.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You didn't check it?
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE -- AFTERNOON
text: The five of them walk across the bridge.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: I'm sorry! I was caught up in the
dialog: excitement of the moment. I should have
dialog: checked. I made a mistake. I suppose
dialog: that none of you have ever made a mistake
dialog: before?
text: No one answers him. Sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and
text: removes the autographed baseball Marcel took from Zammito.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: This is great. After everything we've
dialog: been through we've got eight hundred
text: euros and an autographed baseball.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: The baseball is mine.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: No! You can't have the baseball! You're
dialog: not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
text: Sami throws the baseball back in the canvas bag.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: I'm the one who took it. It's my
dialog: baseball!
speaker_heading: ZERO
dialog: If you say baseball one more time Zero
dialog: will shoot you.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Raymond, don't you think they're over
dialog: reacting a little?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: No. I think they have a right to express
dialog: their anger with you in light of the
dialog: fact that you're...
dialog: (something in him
dialog: snaps)
text: A FUCKIN' MORON! HOW COULD YOU NOT CHECK
text: THE MONEY, YOU GOD DAMN STUPID SHIT-HEAD!
text: Raymond's anger takes everyone by surprise. Even Raymond is
text: surprised by his outburst.
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be
dialog: angry... but I'm the one who took the
dialog: ball and that makes it mine.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: No.
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCEL
dialog: Give it to me, Sami.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: No!
text: Marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag. Sami pulls it away.
text: Marcel grabs the bag. Both of them tug on it. Marcel pulls hard
text: and the bag rips down the seam. The baseball falls out and rolls
text: off the bridge into the river.
speaker_heading: SAMI
dialog: Perfect.
text: Marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag.
text: Sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration.
text: Something catches Daniel's attention.
text: DANIEL'S POV -- of the black canvas. The lining has been ripped
text: away. A light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black
text: canvas. There is a flash of color. Another gust of wind turns
text: the black canvas over. On the other side is Van Gogh's "Vase with
dialog: twelve sunflowers".
text: Daniel's jaw drops. The others notice his stunned expression and
text: follow his stare.
text: THEIR POV -- of the priceless painting.
text: They stand there, too shocked to move at first, then rush forward.
text: They have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them.
text: The wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing. They
text: reach out to grab it, but it is too far away. They stand there,
text: watching as it slowly floats down to the river below.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE -- WIDE SHOT -- AFTERNOON
