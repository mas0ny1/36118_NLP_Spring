scene_heading: EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Rehme walks back to the main base, pulling out his walkie-talkie on the
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: Gotham 4, confirm the kill.
speaker_heading: HELICOPTER PILOT
dialog: Circled the base. Over.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: Security, this is Rehme. We have confirmation from Gotham 4. We have a
text: kill in midharbor. South of the battery. Two in the water dead.
speaker_heading: SECURITY
dialog: Two confirmed.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: Very well.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Rehme walks into a building labeled "LIBERTY ISLAND SECURITY CONTROL and
text: picks up a phone.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: Air traffic, this is Rehme . . .
scene_heading: EXT. AIR TRAFFIC -- NIGHT
text: The helicopter lands. In the background, a BUS FULL OF PRISONERS comes
dialog: up.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS -- NIGHT
text: S.D. "SNAKE" PLISSKEN gets off the bus, looks around, and is escorted by
text: three guards into the base. He looks like the essence of cool. His
text: hair is long, wavy, and ratty, he lost his left eye somewhere along the
text: line, and he's got a two-day beard thing going on. He's wearing a black
text: spandex/kevlar type shirt with zippers across the shoulders, and a pair
text: of camouflage pants with lots of pockets. His jacket is a brown leather
text: jacket that has seen far better days, and he's wearing a pair of
dialog: handcuffs that have, instead of the links we're used to, a straight
text: metal bar between them. He's not resisting anything, but the police are
dialog: not taking any chances.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Plissken and the guards follow a winding stairway down to the main
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Attention. You are now entering the debarkation area. No talking. No
text: smoking. The next scheduled departure to the prison is in two hours.
dialog: You now have the option to terminate and be cremated on the premises.
dialog: If you elect this option, notify the duty sergeant in your processing
dialog: area.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
dialog: EXT. CLOSE UP ON SIGN -- "No talking. No smoking. Follow the ORANGE
dialog: line."
text: EXT. CLOSE UP ON SNAKE. He is not impressed.
text: STEADICAM VIEW OF THE HALL, SNAKE'S P.O.V. Guards, guards, more guards.
dialog: Who cares.
dialog: As Snake rounds the corner:
speaker_heading: O.S. GUARD
dialog: Hold it.
text: Snake stops, turns, directs an impertinent glance at the speaker. He's
dialog: still not impressed by any of this.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
speaker_heading: FADE IN.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Rehme waits as a limo pulls up. Out steps BOB HAUK.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: We've got a small jet in trouble, over restricted air space.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: REHME
text: Seven miles out and closing.
text: The two of them walk AWAY.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Hauk and Rehme walk down the stairs. They turn TOWARD US and walk into
text: the AIR TRAFFIC ROOM. Dozens of men sit in front of radar transmission
text: screens, wearing headsets and working. Following Hauk and Rehme into
dialog: the room:
scene_heading: INT. AIR TRAFFIC ROOM -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: We've been on the board for the last twenty minutes. We haven't been
text: able to reach them. There was a transmission ten minutes ago. He
dialog: identified as "David 14." Then all of a sudden he was cut off.
text: Hauk and Rehme stand behind a CONTROLLER.
speaker_heading: CONTROLLER
dialog: David 14, acknowledge. David 14, we are sending Air Rescue. Squawk
dialog: 7700, contact on 121.5.
dialog: (to Hauk and Rehme)
dialog: There's still no reply.
dialog: (to his headset)
dialog: Bayonne. I have a mayday in restricted space.
speaker_heading: O.S. CONTROLLER
dialog: New York, I have it.
dialog: Hauk pulls Rehme aside.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: You have the code?
speaker_heading: REHME
text: There's no David 14 on the computer.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Unlisted?
speaker_heading: REHME
text: Unregistered code. We telexed Washington. Still waiting for a reply.
speaker_heading: CONTROLLER
dialog: I think I've got him, sir.
text: Hauk and Rehme walk back over to the controller. He patches a voice-
dialog: over through.
speaker_heading: REBEL VOICE
dialog: It's too late, assholes. All your imperialist weapons and lies can't
dialog: save him now. We're going down. We're going to crash.
speaker_heading: CONTROLLER
dialog: David 14, acknowledge!
speaker_heading: CODEMAN
dialog: The code's coming in, sir.
text: Hauk and Rehme dash over to the codeman. He shows them a display.
dialog: "Aircraft Identified. Code: David14. Decode: AIR FORCE ONE."
text: "Air Force One" blinks as Hauk and Rehme look at each other in shock.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANE -- NIGHT
text: The plane is flying over New York.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT -- NIGHT
text: The REBEL has killed the pilot and copilot and is working on her own.
speaker_heading: REBEL
dialog: Tell this to the workers when they ask where your leader went . . .
text: She pulls out a slip of PAPER and proceeds to read.
speaker_heading: REBEL
dialog: We, the soldiers of the national liberation front of America, in the
dialog: name of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country
dialog: have struck a fatal blow to the racist police stick!
scene_heading: INT. PLANE -- NIGHT
text: A secret service AGENT taps on the door with his rifle as the rebel
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: REBEL
dialog: What better revolutionary example than to let the president perish in
dialog: the inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist prison?
text: The agent runs back down the plane to the President and his advisers.
speaker_heading: AGENT
speaker_heading: (to 2ND AGENT)
dialog: Unlock the pod!
text: 2ND AGENT immediately runs off.
text: PAN LEFT TO PRESIDENT.
speaker_heading: AGENT
text: She's bolted the door.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Can't you shoot off the lock?
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: No, sir, she's pressurized the cabin.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: How about lifting the door off of the hinges?
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: No, sir.
text: EXT. CLOSE UP -- The President's wrist as he handcuffs his briefcase to
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Get me to the pod.
text: The President and all his advisors stand up and move to the back of the
dialog: plane.
scene_heading: INT. POD ROOM -- NIGHT
text: The pod opens. An expert attaches a locating device to the President's
dialog: wrist.
speaker_heading: EXPERT
dialog: Sir, this is a locating device to trace you if you become separated from
dialog: the pod. I'm activating it now.
text: SCREENS on the pod begin to light up as the President gets into the pod.
text: He pushes a few buttons.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: God save me and watch over you all.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: A guard watches as Air Force One descends into New York.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Rehme and Hauk watch a computer simulation of the plane.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Computer simulation tracking Air Force One.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
text: The plane goes down.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
scene_heading: EXT. CLOSE UP -- MONITORS
text: As the plane smashes into a building, a red dot drops through the
dialog: building. It's the pod.
speaker_heading: O.S. MAN
dialog: It's down!
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: It's the escape pod.
speaker_heading: REHME
text: 40 degrees, 50 yards from impact.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: I'm going in.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Helicopters prepare for, and execute, launch, and fly into New York. A
dialog: guard watches them.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Rehme watches monitors as Hauk talks.
speaker_heading: HAUK
text: 1-W-Larry. Over the battery. We're moving down. Direct sight ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
text: The helicopters land. A swarm of policemen run out, and Hauk hangs
text: back. He follows with a second swarm. The first swarm assumes a
text: defensive position near the pod. Hauk examines the pod. It's
text: definitely empty, and the rest of the jet is surrounded in flames.
text: An odd LAUGH from nowhere.
text: WEIRDO walks out of the darkness. He nods his head to Hauk.
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: You touch me... he dies. If you're not in the air in thirty seconds...
dialog: he dies. You come back in... he dies.
text: Weirdo takes a package out of his shirt and unwraps it to reveal the
text: President's middle finger, complete with ring.
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: Twenty seconds.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: I'm ready to talk.
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: Nineteen. Eighteen.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: Seventeen. Sixteen.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Let's go. Let's go!
text: Weirdo grins in triumph as the police force swarms back to the
text: helicopters and hauls ass out of New York.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Rehme stands behind a desk, talking on the phone. Hauk is in the
text: foreground, looking pensive.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: Yes, he's right here, Mr. Vice President.
text: Hauk picks up a phone.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: This is Bob Hauk. ...We can't. If we move in with choppers, they'll
dialog: kill him. We're lucky if he's not dead already... They don't want
dialog: anything yet. By the time they figure out what they want, it'll be too
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: Tell him we have to go with your plan now.
text: Hauk waves him off.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: We can't wait until tomorrow. If we have to move in and take the
dialog: island, it's a last resort. It's 8:45. I want permission to try a
dialog: rescue. Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. HAUK'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Hauk calmly arms a .45 pistol. He looks up from his desk.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: OVERPROTECTIVE SECURITY GUARD
dialog: He's dangerous, sir.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: (with quiet confidence)
dialog: I know. I'll be OK.
speaker_heading: HAUK'S P.O.V.
text: We see the silhouette of an unmistakable figure. It's Snake Plissken
text: all right, live and in the flesh. The guards leave. Snake walks into
text: Hauk's office and sits down in the chair across from Hauk. He raises
text: his cuffed hands to Hauk as if to say "Take these off me, asshole," but
text: he doesn't actually say anything. Hauk shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: I'm not a fool, Plissken.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: (coooooool)
dialog: Call me Snake.
text: Hauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: S.D. Plissken. American Lieutenant. Special Forces Unit, Black Flight.
dialog: Two Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia. Youngest man to be decorated
dialog: by the President. You robbed the federal reserve depository. Life
dialog: sentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary. I'm ready to kick your
dialog: ass out of the world, War Hero.
text: Snake could not care less. He reaches forward with his still-cuffed
text: right hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand,
text: strikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette. He lets out a
dialog: calm breath and says:
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Hauk. Police Commissioner.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Bob Hauk...
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Special Forces Unit. Texas Thunder. We heard of you, too, Plissken.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Why are we talking?
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: I have a deal for you. You'll receive full pardon for every criminal
dialog: act committed in the United States.
text: Hauk shows Snake the pardon. Snake's eye lights up. This is something
dialog: he wants. He's interested now, and can't hide it.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: (pressing his advantage)
text: There was an accident about an hour ago. A small jet went down inside
dialog: New York City. The President was on board.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: (re-establishing control over the conversation)
dialog: President of what?
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: That's not funny, Plissken. (beat) You go in, find the President and
dialog: bring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man.
dialog: We sense amusement from Snake. This is not the first time the
dialog: government has asked him for a favor. But he's not a soldier or a "War
dialog: Hero" anymore. He knows they need him more than he needs their pardon.
text: He's holding the cards now, and he knows it.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Twenty-four hours, huh?
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: I'm making you an offer.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Straight just like I said.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I'll think about it.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: No time. Give me an answer.
text: Snake turns away. Hauk is pushing way too hard, and Snake is determined
text: to be in the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Get a new president.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: We're still at war, Plissken. We need him alive.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I don't give a fuck about your war... or your president.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Is that your answer?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I'm thinking about it.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Think hard.
text: Snake pauses to take a draw on his cigarette. Next question:
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Why me?
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad. You know how to get in quiet.
dialog: You're all I've got.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I guess I go in one way or the other. Doesn't mean shit to me. Give me
dialog: the paper.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: When you come out.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Before.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Call me Snake.
scene_heading: INT. WEAPONS ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Rehme talks as we PAN ACROSS a table full of weapons. We see two guns,
text: a belt, grenades, several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, a
text: Uzi, throwing stars, and more. Snake surveys them with a cool
dialog: expression.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: Some of them have cars. They took old junkers that were left behind and
dialog: converted them to steam. We think they may also have a gasoline source
text: in there, and power. Greenhouses, rigged up generators. Some areas
dialog: have streetlights. The crazies. Live in the subways. Complete control
dialog: of the underground. They're night raiders.
dialog: Snake's not into this. He'll figure it out when he gets there. He
text: picks up a bracelet with an eagle on it.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Tracer. Sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes. You push it, we can
dialog: track you on radar. Just like Leningrad. But they added something. A
dialog: safety catch.
dialog: Snake pushes the safety catch. Simple enough. And yes, there's the
text: button. This is familiar. He smiles.
scene_heading: INT. HALL -- NIGHT
text: Snake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now. He walks down the
text: hall to the medical room with Hauk. Rehme has disappeared.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Where am I landing?
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Top of the world trade center. Only place you can land. They won't see
dialog: it, and you can take off from a free fall. On the roof there's a
dialog: service elevator. It's still operational. We use it to infiltrate the
dialog: prison. There's a power box. It'll activate the elevator down to
dialog: fifty. From there on down
dialog: you walk.
text: Snake shrugs on his jacket. He knows Hauk is just trying to assert his
dialog: authority, and it's not working very well.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: You can locate the President by his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist.
dialog: It sends out a sig pulse. Use this.
text: He hands Snake a homing device.
speaker_heading: HAUK
text: Homing device. Shows directions and distance.
scene_heading: INT. MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Snake and Hauk walk into the room. They're met by a young medic.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Strong antitoxin. Stops bacteria and viral-proofs you for 24 hours.
text: Snake braces himself against a table. The medic is holding an
dialog: injection-type tech gizmo.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: Take off the jacket.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I'll be OK.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Let's go, Plissken.
text: Snake shrugs off his jacket, disoriented by the place. He's nervous.
text: His hackles are up.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I don't like needles.
text: Hauk straps a timer gauge onto Snake's left hand. He activates it and
text: the time blinks on. It's counting down as we speak.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Twenty-two hours, twenty-nine minutes, fifty-seven seconds...
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: We talked about twenty-four.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: In twenty-two hours the Hartford Summit meeting will be over. China and
dialog: the Soviet Union will go back home. The president was on his way to the
dialog: summit when his plane went down.
text: Snake snorts.
speaker_heading: HAUK
text: He has a briefcase attached to his wrist. The tape recording inside has
dialog: to reach Hartford in 22 hours.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: What's on it?
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: You know anything about nuclear fusion?
dialog: Snake turns away. No. Nuclear fusion is not his area of expertise.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: It's about the survival of the human race, Plissken. Something you
dialog: don't give a shit about.
text: Hauk steps aside. The medic swabs Snake's neck on both sides.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: I'm going to inject you. It'll sting for a second or two...
text: He raises a couple of hypos and injects Snake with them. Snake jumps a
dialog: little; clearly, this is not one of the world's most pleasant things.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: That's it, Plissken.
text: Snake gets off the table. The medic turns around.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: Tell him.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Tell me what?
dialog: Hauk thinks he's got him this time. Snake doesn't like that.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: That idea you had about turning the Gullfire around 180 degrees and
dialog: flying off to Canada.
text: Hauk shakes his head. Snake puts his jacket down and turns to the
dialog: medic.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: What did you do to me, asshole?
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: My idea, Plissken. Something we've been fooling around with. Two
dialog: microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries. They're already starting
text: to dissolve. In twenty-two hours, the cores will completely dissolve.
text: Inside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge. Not a large explosive.
dialog: About the size of a pinhead. Just big enough to --
dialog: (he gestures)
dialog: open up both your arteries. I'd say you'd be dead in ten or fifteen
dialog: seconds --
text: Hauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: TAKE THEM OUT NOW.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
text: They're protected by the cores. Fifteen minutes before the last hour is
dialog: up we can neutralize the charge with X-rays.
text: Snake lets go of Hauk to look at his watch. 22:57:38. 37. 36. This
text: is his life he's watching tick away.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: We'll burn out the charges IF you have the President.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: What if I'm a little late?
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: No more Hartford Summit. And no more Snake Plissken.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: When I get back I'm going to kill you.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: The Gullfire's waiting.
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT
text: Snake pulls up in a Jeep. He walks up to the tiny plane called the
text: Gullfire. Two guards stand by to make sure he just gets in the plane
text: and does his job. He throws his cigarette out onto the runway and
text: closes the overhead window.
scene_heading: INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
text: Snake turns on his monitors.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I'm ready.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: 21 hours.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Suppose he's dead, Hauk. If I come back without him, you'll burn these
dialog: things out?
scene_heading: INT. BASE --- NIGHT
text: Hauk and Rehme exchange a glance; Hauk's been expecting this question to
dialog: come up.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Get them both back, Plissken.
scene_heading: INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
text: Snake doesn't like the response, but figures he can't do anything about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Remember, once inside you're on your own.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Oh, you mean I can't count on you?
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Good.
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT
text: A larger plane hauls the Gullfire into the air; the Gullfire is
text: essentially a big hang glider.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
dialog: Hauk checks Snake's life clock, "Master Life Clock".
dialog: 20:17:43... 42... 41....
scene_heading: INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
dialog: Snake's watch reads 20:17:40... 39... 38... 37... 36... 35...
text: He starts controlling the plane. He flips the tracer open and hits the
dialog: button, testing it.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: The master life clock shows the test confirmation.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Tracer test confirmed at 20 hours, 17 minutes, 30 seconds.
text: Hauk, Rehme and the Vice President nod with relief.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
text: Snake takes the plane in.
scene_heading: INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
text: Snake looks over his monitors. He sees New York coming up.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Hauk waits at his microphone.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Are you picking up the target blip?
scene_heading: INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Right on course.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
text: The plane aims for the World Trade Center.
scene_heading: INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: It's been a while . . .
text: The plane is aiming right at a building.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: How's your altitude?
text: Snake calmly angles the plane up.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Plissken? Plissken? Plissken, what are you doing?
scene_heading: INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Playing with myself. I'm going in.
text: Snake targets the World Trade Center. He checks his instruments.
scene_heading: EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
text: The plane comes down. It hits hard. Snake puts on the brakes, adds a
text: grappling hook, and finally comes to a stop right at the edge.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Plissken? Plissken?
scene_heading: EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
text: Snake walks over to the elevator. He uses the power box to get the
text: elevator started. He looks around, and the doors open. He gets in the
text: elevator. The doors close.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I'm inside the World Trade Center on the 50th floor. Just like
dialog: Leningrad, Hauk.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Is the glider intact?
scene_heading: INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
text: Snake stands with his walkie-talkie in the middle of the graffiti-
dialog: covered building.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Yeah, but taking off is for shit. I'll work it out.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: You'll have to use the east stairwell. It'll take you a little while to
dialog: get to ground level.
text: Snake checks his life clock. 19:22:44. 43. 42.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Call me when you get outside.
text: Snake puts his walkie-talkie away as someone runs past. He doesn't
text: notice. He walks on.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
speaker_heading: FADE IN.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
text: Snake walks along with his tracer. He goes through alleys and streets.
text: He draws his gun as he walks by a group of people. He's armed and ready
dialog: to fight.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANE CRASH -- NIGHT
text: The plane is still burning. Smoke is coming from everywhere. The plane
text: is severed in the middle. The crash is very impressive. Snake walks
text: and notices a few people go by. He pulls out his walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I'm at the plane. Nobody else made it, Hauk.
text: Something beeps. His tracer.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: He looks at his tracer. A small red dot lights up in the southeast
dialog: corner.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I've got his pulse. Right up ahead, moving northwest.
text: He puts away his walkie-talkie and checks his life clock. 18:50:18.
dialog: 17. 16.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Images. Snake holding the tracer. He gets closer and comes up to a
text: building, formerly a theater. He walks in.
scene_heading: INT. THEATER -- NIGHT
text: The pulse keeps getting stronger. Snake walks in. He holds his gun at
dialog: the ready. There's a truly horrible musical going on.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: ACTORS
dialog: This is hell! This is hate! (etc.)
text: Snake looks around. No sign of the president, but there is a CABBIE
text: enjoying the show. Time to move on. He enters against his better
dialog: judgment, but he's just passing through, so that's OK.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
text: Snake keeps moving, but there's a noise. He turns around, aiming his
text: gun. Cabbie holds up his hands.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Hey! You're Snake Plissken, ain't you?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Nothin'.
text: Snake lowers his gun.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: I thought you were dead!
text: Snake moves on.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Hey! You don't want to walk around down there, Snake!
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
text: The signal from the tracer keeps getting closer and closer. Snake walks
text: past a gang beating up and stripping a semi-conscious girl. He doesn't
text: take much notice. He keeps going. He sees a BUM sitting by a fire.
speaker_heading: BUM
dialog: Hi, Chief. Nice night. Nice boots. Niiiiice boots. Hey.
text: A guy tries to sneak up behind Snake. Snake knocks him out and points
text: his gun at the bum.
speaker_heading: BUM
dialog: Easy now, chief. I'm walking. I'm walking.
text: The bum walks away. Snake keeps going. A man beats up another man at a
text: sink. The beatee is wearing the President's life tracer. Snake kicks
text: the beater and knocks him out.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Mr. President . . .
text: The man wearing the life tracer looks up and smiles. He's a DRUNK.
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: I'm the President? Sure, I'm the President. If I knew where I got this
dialog: thing --
dialog: (indicates the tracer)
dialog: I'd be the President.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Where did you get it?
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: I woke up, and there it was, just like a miracle . . .
text: Snake slams the tracer against the sink.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: The President's life signs all fail.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Oh my god . . .
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: It . . . It may be just an impact on the mechanism itself . . .
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
text: Snake pulls up his walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Hauk?!
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: I'm right here, Plissken.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I don't know who you assholes are looking at, but it's NOT the
dialog: President.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
text: Snake holds the walkie-talkie up to the drunk.
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: (to the tune of Joy to the World)
dialog: Hail to the chief . . . La la la la la la . . .
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: All right, get your machine ready. I'm coming out.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: 18 hours, Plissken.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Listen to me, Hauk. The President is DEAD, you got that? Somebody's
dialog: had him for dinner!
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Plissken, if you get back in that glider I'll shoot you down. You climb
dialog: out, I'll burn you off the wall. You understand that, Plissken?
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT
text: Snake stares at his walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: A little human compassion . . .
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
text: Snake walks on. He's in an area with streetlights. He keeps going.
scene_heading: EXT. POD -- NIGHT
text: Snake stares at the pod. No clues. He looks around. Nothing. As he
text: comes back up, he sets up a chair and sits down heavily. He touches his
text: neck. It's like he can feel the cores dissolving.
text: A crazy walks past, bangs on manhole covers. Snake doesn't know what
dialog: he's doing, but he doesn't like it. Especially not when the manhole
text: covers start to rise up. He runs off.
scene_heading: EXT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT
text: Snake finds the restaurant, and runs inside. No one follows.
scene_heading: INT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT
text: Snake backs into a corner. The floor is weak and starts to go out from
text: under him once. He gets into the shadows. There's someone there.
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: You a cop?
text: Snake levels his gun at her.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: No . . .
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: You've got a gun. You got a smoke?
text: Snake tosses her his cigarettes. She lights one.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Keep your hand over it.
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: It's all right if we're quiet. They won't hear us.
dialog: (reacting to the cigarette)
dialog: Hey, this is a real one. You just get in?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: What's going on out there?
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: Crazies. It's the end of the month. They're out of food.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Do you live here?
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: Skulls? You kidding? I'm with the Turks now. I just got caught in the
dialog: street after dark and now I'm stuck here all night.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: A plane crashed seven hours ago. Did you see it?
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: You're a cop.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I'm an asshole.
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: Hey, wait a minute. I know who you are. Yeah! But I heard you were
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: Wow, Snake Plissken. All right! What you doing in here with a gun,
dialog: Snake?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Looking for somebody.
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: The President.
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: Come on! He really here?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Somewhere.
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: When you find him, are you gonna take him out?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Mm-hm.
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: Take me out with you, Snake.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GIRL IN CHOCK FULL O' NUTS
dialog: I can think of lots of reasons why . . .
text: She makes a move to kiss him, but there's a noise. They split up, but
text: she gets sucked through the floor. Snake tries to save her, but it's
text: too late. He gets the hell out of there.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING -- NIGHT, EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT, EXT. ALLEYS -- NIGHT
text: Snake runs through the building, breaks a window, and climbs up a fire
text: escape to get to a new floor. He breaks a window to get in, then pulls
text: a cabinet in front of the window. He shoots through the cabinet,
text: causing some crazy to scream. He busts down a door, shoots open part of
text: a wall, busts through that, climbs out a window, and climbs down a
text: telephone pole. He then climbs up a wall. On the way he drops his
text: walkie-talkie. He runs down an alley, and as he does, Cabbie pulls up.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Where you goin', buddy?
text: Snake points his gun at Cabbie. He looks behind him, then gets in the
dialog: cab.
scene_heading: INT. CAB -- NIGHT
text: Snake notices a tape player which is playing the theme from "American
dialog: Bandstand."
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Bad neighborhood, Snake! You don't want to be walking from the Bowery
dialog: to 42nd street at night! I've been driving a cab here for 30 years and
dialog: I'm telling you, you don't walk around here at night! Yes, sir!
dialog: They'll kill you and strip you in ten seconds flat. Usually I'm not
dialog: down around here myself, but I wanted to catch that show.
text: Cabbie lights a rag stuffed down the neck of a bottle which is full of
dialog: gasoline.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: This stuff is like gold around here, you know.
scene_heading: EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
text: Cabbie throws the bottle into the alley, where it explodes.
scene_heading: INT. CAB -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Hey, Snake, when'd you get in? I didn't even know they caught you.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Ohhh, Snake Plissken in my cab. Wait'll I tell Eddie! Hey, hang on,
dialog: Snake.
scene_heading: EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
text: Cabbie makes a sharp turn.
scene_heading: INT. CAB -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Hey, what were you doing back there, Snake?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Looking for somebody.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Well, why didn't you ask me? Hell, I know everybody in this town. Yes,
dialog: sir. I've been driving this cab for thirty years, this very same cab.
text: Snake points his gun at Cabbie.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I'm GONNA ask you. Now where's the President?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: The Duke's got him! Everyone knows the Duke's got him! You don't have
dialog: to put a gun to my head. I'll tell you!
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Who's the Duke?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: The DUKE! The Duke of New York! A-Number-1! The big man, that's who!
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I want to meet this Duke.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: You can't meet the Duke, are you crazy? Nobody wants to meet the Duke!
dialog: You meet him once and then you're dead!
text: Snake points the gun more insistently. Tough.
scene_heading: EXT. BRAIN'S BUILDING -- NIGHT
text: Cabbie parks the cab and he and Snake walk up to Brain's building.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: I hate to leave her on the street. Usually I don't leave her alone at
dialog: all. But you're a special case, Snake.
text: He and Snake walk up to the door. Cabbie knocks on the door with his
dialog: shoe.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: It's OK, Snake. It's a better neighborhood. You can relax.
dialog: Relax? Snake checks his life clock. 17:40:46. 45. 44. Relax, my ass.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Boy, they got a great place here. Like a fortress!
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: They?
text: From the inside, someone answers.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: It's me!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Who's me?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Cabbie!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Somebody wants to see Brain, it's important --
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No way, Cabbie --
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: No, it's Snake! Snake Plissken!
text: Maggie opens the door. She stands there and surveys the pair.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: YOU'RE Plissken?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: He wants to see Brain.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I want to meet the Duke.
text: Snake and Maggie exchange a glance. She leads them in.
scene_heading: INT. BRAIN'S -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Hey, what do you think of this place, Snake? It used to be a public
dialog: library. Oh, that Brain, he's the greatest! Mr. Fabulous! Duke loves
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: (gesturing at Maggie)
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: That's Maggie. Brain's squeeze. The Duke gave him to Brain just to
dialog: keep him happy . . . see what I mean?
dialog: Snake can tell that Maggie's more than just Brain's squeeze; she's his
dialog: bodyguard, too. She looks like she'd be willing to kill to protect
dialog: Brain.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Heard you were dead.
scene_heading: INT. BRAIN'S ROOM -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Brain? Brain! I brought somebody to see you!
text: Snake looks at Brain. He knows this guy.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Harold Helman.
text: Brain puts down his book and stands up.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Snake?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: "Harold"?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Where you been, Harold? It's been a long time.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You never told me you knew Snake Plissken, Brain.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Isn't that great? Hey, Brain, I could use some gas if you can spare
dialog: some . . .
text: No one pays attention. Snake advances on Brain. Brain sits down.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I'm glad you remember me. Yeah. A man should remember his past.
dialog: Kansas City, four years ago. You ran out on me. You left me sitting
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: You were late.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: We were buddies, Harold. You, me, and Fresno Bob. You know what they
dialog: did to Bob?
text: His face changes. He suddenly kicks Brain's chair into the wall and
text: points his gun.
text: Maggie draws a knife and starts advancing on Snake.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: You want to see him sprayed all over that map, baby?
dialog: (to Brain)
dialog: Where's the President?!
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Swear to god, Snake, I don't know --
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Don't fuck with me!
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Why do you want to know?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I want him.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Working for the man now, huh?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Then I'll just beat it out of your squeeze --
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Mm-hm. Maggie doesn't know EXACTLY where he is and unless you know
dialog: EXACTLY PRECISELY where he is you'll never find him.
text: Snake takes his gun away. He contemplates Brain.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Listen, I'll take you out of here. Yeah. Jet glider just a couple of
dialog: blocks down the street. And all you gotta do is get me to him.
dialog: Everyone realizes the importance of this.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: No kidding? On the level? Will you take me, too?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: We've got to deal somewhere else.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: No glider.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: We've got the President. And the Duke's taking everybody out of here.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Never happen. See, I know something you and the Duke don't know. We've
dialog: only got so long before Mr. President don't mean a whole lot.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: You're lying.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Maybe he's not . . .
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: I know him! Look at his face, he's lying!
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Right, Harold. I'm lying. So I might as well have some fun and keep
dialog: looking by myself.
text: He cocks his gun and points it at Brain again.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Brain --
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Talk to him, baby --
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Brain, he'll kill us both if you don't tell him --
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: (panicking)
dialog: Brain, you've got to tell him!
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (panicking)
dialog: Brain, you've got to tell him --
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: Tell him, tell him, tell him --
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: ALL RIGHT!!!
text: Snake lowers the gun.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: You always were smart, Harold.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Just one thing right now. Don't call me "Harold."
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT
text: Snake, Maggie, Cabbie and Brain all walk out.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: So you work for this Duke, huh?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Yeah. Make gas for him. Figure out things for him.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: (showing off)
dialog: Like how to get across the 69th street bridge -- it's mined, but I know
dialog: where they're planted.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: We got a diagram from a guy that got all the way across . . . before
dialog: they shot the poor bastard.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
text: We got a crew up there now clearing the way across the first barricade.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: What a sight, Snake! The whole camp rolling right across the bridge and
dialog: the President right out front! Oh, that would have been so fine . . .
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (ironically)
dialog: Yeah, it would have been . . .
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Yeah, but we're going with Snake now.
text: The three of them cross into the street. Cabbie panics.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: That's the Duke! I know the sound of his engines. Don't cross the Duke
dialog: -- everybody knows that.
text: We get one glimpse of the Duke's car. Then we realize that Cabbie is
text: gone and his cab is racing away.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Cabbie, you slime!
text: The Duke's car heads right for us.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No, Brain!
text: The two of them run off. After a while, Snake follows. The three of
text: them hide. The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended
text: over the headlights. It's in a caravan of three, leading the way. A
text: fourth car comes up later. The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of
text: a car with Weirdo in the back. The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at
text: his side. The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy
text: jacket, bluejeans, and boots. He looks TOUGH. He sends Weirdo to knock
dialog: on the door.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He's looking for you, Brain.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: What does he want?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: He wants my diagram of the bridge. When he finds out I'm with you he's
dialog: going to want my life! Shit, Plissken, I knew I shouldn't have listened
dialog: to you --
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: We've got to get to the President NOW, while he's busy.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Forget it, he's on the other side of town and we got no wheels. The
dialog: deal is off --
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Just calm down.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR -- NIGHT
text: A lone man sits, looking bored. Snake subtly goes up to him, knocks him
text: out, and gets him out of the car. He briefly considers shooting the guy
text: on the hood of the car. Instead, the guy on the hood of the car walks
text: around. Snake knocks him out a second alter and then drives to get
text: Brain and Maggie. He knocks the other guy out of the car.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: I think they saw us! Turn left, turn left here!
scene_heading: INT. CAR -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Brain, this is Broadway.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: I know, I know, the Duke'll take Seventh Avenue, Broadway is five
dialog: minutes --
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: No!!!
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Yes!!! Just keep driving!
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: What's wrong with Broadway?
scene_heading: EXT. BROADWAY -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: (to the car)
dialog: Come on sweetheart . . .
text: People start throwing bricks. Snake hands his gun to Brain, who passes
text: it to Maggie, holding it like a dead rat (or like a macho guy would hold
text: a purse). Snake drives as fast as he can, gunning off the bystander who
text: gets on the car. A bystander grabs Brain.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Maggie!
text: Maggie protects him. She shoots the people grabbing at him. Snake
text: angles the car through a pile of scrap metal and drives away. He glares
text: at Brain. Everyone seems visibly shaken.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Hold on.
text: Snake backs the car through a bunch of piled cars. He takes off, the
dialog: car a bit worse for wear but at least they got away from the crowd on
dialog: Broadway.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAINS -- NIGHT
text: Brain points to the cars as Snake watches.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
text: He'll be in the third car from the end, by the last campfire.
text: Snake looks around. The Duke's caravan passes. There are more cars
dialog: than there were before.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: It's all right. He's got to go in the front way. It'll take him five
dialog: minutes. If you're not back to the car in four minutes you're on your
dialog: own.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: When we get there, Harold, you just keep talking.
text: They drive off. Snake gets to the trains. No one notices. Maggie and
text: Brain get out of the car and Snake ducks into the train car.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Hi, guys. Hi . . . how's it going? Cooled off a little, huh?
speaker_heading: HEAD DUDE
dialog: What do you want, Brain?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Duke told us to wait inside. He's on his way here now.
speaker_heading: HEAD DUDE
dialog: He didn't say nothing to us about it.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Well, you can't expect him to tell everybody in the joint, now can you?
dialog: That's why he's the Duke.
text: The camera angles back to show Snake walking on top of the railroad
text: cars. He hasn't found the President yet. But he doesn't have time to
dialog: wonder if Brain double-crossed him.
speaker_heading: HEAD DUDE
dialog: Why don't we wait outside here for him?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Why don't we wait inside for him?
speaker_heading: HEAD DUDE
dialog: 'Cause I got orders, that's why.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: What are your specific orders, by the way?
speaker_heading: HEAD DUDE
dialog: Specific orders, Brain, was for me not to let no one go inside.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: How's the President holding up, by the way? Any political discussion
dialog: you've had with him?
scene_heading: INT. PRESIDENT'S TRAIN CAR -- NIGHT
text: Two guards sit with the President, talking. The first guard is by the
text: President. The second is looking out the window.
speaker_heading: SECOND GUARD
dialog: That Brain is a real pain in the ass. He's always sniffing around like
dialog: a dog.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
text: He comes up with the gas.
text: The second guard looks out the window. Snake grabs him by the neck, and
text: breaks it. The first guard doesn't notice, but the President does, and
dialog: that tips off the guard.
speaker_heading: FIRST GUARD
dialog: What are you looking at?
text: He turns and Snake throws a star at him. It lodges right in his brain,
text: but not fast enough. Snake is hit in the leg with a crossbow arrow.
text: Snake limps over to the President and starts uncuffing him. The
dialog: president still has the briefcase. This is it, this is the big time.
dialog: Snake keeps calm.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Are you from the outside?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Stop shaking.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I can't! Who are you?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Hauk sent me. We've got to move fast.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Move fast? You're goddamned right I'll move fast.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Quiet!
text: Snake limps away, President in the lead.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT
text: Snake and the President keep moving. Suddenly, Snake gets jumped. Ten
text: guys surround him and the President, and though Snake fights well, it's
text: not well enough. Brain comes out with Maggie.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: They got him. Now watch him.
text: The Duke steps out from the car, followed by Weirdo.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Friend of yours, Brain?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: He had a gun on me, Duke, there was nothing I could do.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (not believing it for a second)
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Weirdo points accusingly as he and Duke walk away.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Maggie . . .
text: Duke walks up to Snake. Snake isn't giving in even though he's pretty
dialog: sure he's beat.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Who are you?
text: Snake doesn't answer. Duke grabs the arrow still lodged in his right
text: leg and pulls on it. Snake writhes in agony.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I said who are you?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Snake Plissken, Duke. The Man sent him in here. Something's going down
dialog: . . . we need him.
text: Duke recognizes the name. He is impressed. He lets go of the arrow.
dialog: Snake hates him more than ever.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Snaaaaaake Plissken. I've heard of you.
text: He raises a crowbar over his head and smacks Snake with it, knocking him
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: DUKE

scene_heading: INT. ROOM -- DAY
text: Plissken lies unconscious on a bed, crossbow pointed at his head. Three

scene_heading: INT. BASE -- DAY
speaker_heading: VICE PRESIDENT
dialog: We've got to go in now.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: We hold.
speaker_heading: VICE PRESIDENT
dialog: You're countermanding my orders, Hauk.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: This is my prison, I'll give the orders.
speaker_heading: VICE PRESIDENT
dialog: I override all that!
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Just try.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY

scene_heading: INT. ROOM -- DAY
text: Snake begins to come to. We hear gunshots and cheering. The guards go
dialog: to announce Snake's consciousness.
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR -- DAY
text: Brain and Maggie move to the center of the gunshots and cheering
scene_heading: INT. TARGET PRACTICE -- DAY
text: The Duke sits firing with Plissken's gun at the President, whose
text: briefcase is still chained to his arm.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM -- DAY
text: Snake sits up. There are LOTS of crossbows aimed at him.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Don't move, Snake.
text: Snake turns to face him. He stands up. We see for the first time
text: exactly why he's called "Snake" Plissken. There's a snake tattooed on
text: his stomach. The snake's tail disappears into his pants, but we have a
dialog: good idea of where it leads and what it becomes. Ah ha.
text: Snake's life clock is gone. He has no idea how much time he's got.
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: INT. TARGET PRACTICE -- DAY
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I want that diagram, Brain.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Oh. It's at my place, Duke. Duke, that Plissken said something about a
dialog: time limit.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: What time limit?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: (gesturing at President)
dialog: On him.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: That's a lot of crap.
dialog: (to the President)
dialog: What did I teach you?
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: You... You are... the Duke of New... New York... You're... A-Number-One.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I can't hear you.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: YOU ARE... THE DUKE OF NEW YORK... YOU'RE A-NUMBER-ONE!
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (to Brain)
dialog: Get me the diagram.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Duke... Don't kill Plissken. We need him.
text: The Duke points the gun at Brain, but doesn't even give him a glance.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Get moving, Brain.
text: Brain moves, and Weirdo laughs that odd laugh. The Duke fires at the
text: President's briefcase. Papers and a tape fall out. Weirdo looks down
text: and kicks the tape away. He picks it up and holds it to his ear, then
text: puts it in his pocket. Guards come and unstrap the President. The Duke
dialog: has decided to take Snake a bit more seriously than he had.
dialog: Which is not saying much.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: Helicopters fly above ground. A group stands with a car, gesturing
dialog: wildly.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: People out below in the park. Can you see them?
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Surveillance 2 to Security Control. We're getting that readout, mostly
dialog: in the infrared.
text: Hauk and Rehme immediately check out the monitor. At least something's
dialog: going on.
speaker_heading: PILOT
text: We have a visual sighting on it. It's a crowd of prisoners in Central
text: Park. They're waving at us. Signaling us in the food drop area.
dialog: They're waving us down.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: The prisoners wave the helicopters down. A group of guards lands and
text: runs over to the station wagon. They get the briefcase which has been
text: sawed off the President's handcuffs.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: Snake is awake and surrounded by guards. The cheers are louder.
scene_heading: INT. BRAIN'S -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: Maggie walks across the room, loading a gun. It's one of Snake's.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: I still can't figure out whether that son of a bitch Plissken was
dialog: telling the truth or not. God, I hate that guy.
text: Brain stands in front of his maps.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He got in somehow.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Yeah, yeah, but how? You gotta land the glider and take off.
dialog: (he gestures at the map)
dialog: You can't do it in Central Park, there's too many trees. Port
dialog: Authority's too low to the ground. Unless it was some...
dialog: (he gets it... they don't call him "Brain" for nothing)
dialog: Someplace high up. World Trade Center. That's it. There we go. The
dialog: World Trade Center. And it's gonna be a hell of a lot easier for me to
dialog: take off than it was for him to land.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: Hauk reads the note left in the briefcase.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: "Amnesty for all prisoners in New York City in exchange for President.
dialog: 69th Street Bridge tomorrow, 12 Noon. No bullshit or he's dead."
speaker_heading: VICE PRESIDENT
dialog: Where's the tape?
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Not here.
text: He reaches inside and removes a pair of goggles.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: They're Plissken's.
dialog: Yeah, they were on the table. He never did use them, though, and only
dialog: half of them is necessary in his case anyway.
speaker_heading: VICE PRESIDENT
dialog: So much for your man, Hauk?
text: Hauk hesitates. This is the last thing he wants.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Warm up the choppers. We're moving in.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE -- SUNSET
text: Helicopters prepare for takeoff.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- SUNSET
text: Hauk sits at the microphone.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Plissken?
text: The master life clock reads 1:56:38. 37. 36,
scene_heading: INT. ROOM -- SUNSET
text: Snake slowly gets to his feet. He's still groggy, but it's time for him
dialog: to move.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Come on, get up!
text: Snake limps through a hallway and into a stadium.
scene_heading: INT. STADIUM -- SUNSET
text: Boos greet Snake as he walks in. In the center of the room is a
text: fighting ring. Snake climbs in, not without effort. A huge and
text: extremely ugly man climbs into the ring, amid loud cheers. Snake
text: notices that the huge ugly dude is wearing his life clock. In the
text: balcony above is the Duke. The Duke stands up and raises his arms, and
dialog: everyone gets silent.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: They sent in their best man. And when we roll down the 69th street
dialog: bridge tomorrow on our way to freedom, we're gonna have their best man
text: leading the way. From the neck up.
text: The crowd cheers.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: On the hood of my car!
text: More cheers.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Let's do it!
text: Ugly and Snake take bats. They circle each other. Ugly strikes at
text: Snake. Snake ricochets off the ring. He rolls around, fighting for his
dialog: life.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING -- SUNSET
text: Brain and Maggie walk around. They knock on a door and Weirdo answers.
text: He's wearing Cabbie's hat.
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Where'd you get the hat?
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: Got it from Cabbie.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: Traded him.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: What are you so nervous about?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: I'm here to see the President.
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: Who says?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: The Duke.
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: No he doesn't.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Well... I'll have to tell him you said that.
dialog: Weirdo doesn't really believe it. If it's not true, so what?
dialog: But if it IS true, the Duke will have him tortured to death.
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: Wait a minute. Why?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
text: He's got something hidden in his clothing. The Duke wants it.
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: I'll show you.
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: You'll tell me.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Cyanide capsules. The Duke don't want a dead president.
text: Brain pushes his way in.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM -- SUNSET
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Gentlemen. Mr. President.
text: Weirdo lets the door slide closed. Brain starts checking the
text: President's clothes. The President has been dressed in a wig and tied
text: to a chair with an American Flag on it.
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: Cyanide?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Yeah. He might try to take it tomorrow.
text: Weirdo walks up to Brain.
speaker_heading: WEIRDO
dialog: That's bullshit. You're not supposed to be in here, Brain --
text: Brain stabs Weirdo, who dies with a gasp. Maggie dispatches of the
text: three guards. She smiles. Brain unties the President's hand. The
text: President snatches off the wig in a rage.
scene_heading: INT. TOURNAMENT -- SUNSET
text: Snake notices a guard wearing the eagle tracer. A trash can lid and a
text: bat with spikes on it is handed to him. The next round begins.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE -- EVENING
text: Brain, the President, and Maggie sneak out. A guy in a cowboy hat
dialog: notices.
scene_heading: INT. TOURNAMENT -- EVENING
text: Ugly and Snake keep fighting. Snake is not doing very well. But he's
text: catching up. As Ugly tries to hit him, he nails Ugly in the groin, then
text: in the back of the head. The crowd begins cheering "SNAKE! SNAKE!"
text: The Duke can't believe it. Snake runs to the guard with the tracer and
dialog: activates it.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- EVENING
text: The Master Life Clock begins blinking "Tracer Status: ACTIVATED."
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
text: Tracer activated at one hour, thirty-five minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
text: Rehme jumps out of his seat.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: Hauk!!
scene_heading: INT. TOURNAMENT -- EVENING
text: Snake limps around, getting his stuff back together. He looks at his
text: life clock. 1:34:54. 53. He doesn't have much time.
text: The guy in the cowboy hat runs up to the Duke and yells for attention.
text: Duke immediately gets up and leaves, as do his hangers-on.
speaker_heading: GUY IN COWBOY HAT
dialog: LISTEN!!! LISTEN!!! LISTEN!!!
text: The crowd shuts up.
speaker_heading: GUY IN COWBOY HAT
dialog: THE PRESIDENT'S GONE! BRAIN TOOK HIM!
text: The crowd rushes out. Snake limps out of the ring and runs off as fast
dialog: as he can.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE -- EVENING
text: Rehme catches up to Hauk at the last second. Hauk has been stalling.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: (shouting over noise)
dialog: Hauk! Plissken's tracer!
text: Hauk runs up to the head helicopter pilot.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Get on the radio! Keep them down! Nobody move!
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- EVENING
text: Two monitors show Snake's tracer.
speaker_heading: REHME
text: He's approaching the World Trade Center.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: I knew that son of a bitch was alive.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: He's inside.
scene_heading: INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- EVENING
text: Snake limps around. He notices a cab. Fifty flights of stairs with
text: his leg shot to hell. He hesitates only for a second, then starts up.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- EVENING
text: The Vice President, Hauk and Rehme all stand, staring at the monitors.
speaker_heading: VICE PRESIDENT
dialog: It's gone.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: The signal only lasts for 15 minutes. Download the choppers. We're in
dialog: a standby situation.
text: Rehme runs off.
speaker_heading: VICE PRESIDENT
dialog: Anybody could have pushed that button.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Only Plissken knew there was a safety catch. Now we'll give him a
dialog: little more time, just to make sure.
text: The master clock shows 59:44. 43.
scene_heading: EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
text: Snake gets out of the elevator. Maggie, Brain, and the President all
text: take cover behind a chimney and try to get a gang to stop chopping down
text: the glider. It doesn't work. The glider floats away.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Goddamned redskins! They're savages, Mr. President!
text: Snake runs to get them. They get in the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT
text: Snake has the President by the arm and is leading everyone out.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Listen, Snake, I swear to god, I thought you were dead --
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Yeah, you and everybody else.
text: He grabs Brain by the tie and aims the gun at his head.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: That's your car in the lobby? The keys! Quick! Quick! Diagram of the
dialog: bridge! Hey, hey, hey --
dialog: Snake takes all the abovementioned items.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: I'm the only one who knows how to read that, Snake --
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Stay out of my way, Harold.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Besides, you can't read and drive at the same time. You need us!
dialog: Snake is tired. He's pissed. He's got half an hour to live if that.
text: He doesn't have time for Brain's shit, and he lets him know it.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: You shouldn't have double-crossed me again, Brain. Come on, let's go --
text: He suddenly notices there's nothing on the end of the President's chain.
text: He holds it in front of the President's face.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: They sawed it off...
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: The tape?
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Gone... I don't know where...
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: I do.
text: Snake shoots him a look. Bullshit, his eyes say, but maybe Brain is
dialog: telling the truth. Maybe.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Swear to god, Snake, I know where it is. Just take us to the car and
dialog: I'll take you right to it.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Shit...
text: He tosses the diagram of the bridge to Brain. They go down the stairs.
text: Snake's in bad shape, but it's everyone else who's complaining.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Don't talk. Breathe.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Come on, come on, we're wasting time!
text: Snake gets into the car. It won't start.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Dead, Harold.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: What?!
text: Snake hands the keys to Brain.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Here, take these.
text: Snake looks under the hood. There's a man with a crossbow pointed
text: straight at him. Shit. They've been caught. Again.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Car trouble?
text: Snake looks over the hood. There's the Duke. With a dozen guards.
text: Brain steps out.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Hi, Duke.
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: This whole deal of yours is over, Snake. You and Brain just say good-
dialog: bye to each other.
text: The Duke turns away and loses aim of his gun for a moment. At that
text: moment, Snake pulls a gun and fires at the steam vent. At the same
text: time, Maggie slams the hood shut on the guard with the crossbow. Steam
text: flies everywhere, enough for cover. The four of them run for it. The
text: Duke runs after them.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT
text: A cab pulls up. Its radio is playing "American Bandstand". Guess who's
dialog: driving? You got it!
text: The group of four runs up to the cab. Snake runs around and makes
text: Cabbie scoot over. He wants to drive. Cabbie looks shocked.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: GO, GO!
text: The Duke and his followers arrive too late.
scene_heading: INT. CAB -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: (trying to explain the map)
dialog: ...and then there's three more...
text: Snake waves him off. Cabbie's trying to make conversation.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: They're behind us --
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: They come in groups of threes!
text: Snake pops the American Bandstand tape out of the tape player and puts
dialog: it in his pocket.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Where's the tape, Brain?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: What tape?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Tape...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: The tape from the briefcase!
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Oh, that tape!
text: He pulls it out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Here it is!
text: Cabbie hands it to Snake. Brain laughs, trying to cover his ass.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: You traded away your hat for it!
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: How'd you know?
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: See, see!
text: Snake pops it into the deck. It begins spewing out information. It's
text: the right one. He slips it into his pocket.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Here, give me that tape!
dialog: HA! No way!
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Not just yet.
dialog: Snake checks his life clock. 23:20. 19. 18. 17. Didn't that guy say 15
dialog: minutes before the last hour was up? But Hauk said they'd been playing
text: with this, so the 15 minutes was built in already. Still, 23 minutes.
dialog: That's cutting it pretty fucking close.
scene_heading: EXT. CAB -- NIGHT
text: Snake races as fast as the cab can go.
scene_heading: INT. CAB -- NIGHT
dialog: Snake checks to make sure they're not being followed too closely.
text: They're not. The Duke is behind, but he's FAR behind.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Easy... easy!
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Go for it, Snake!
scene_heading: EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
text: Snake jumps the car over the first obstacle. Cabbie looks like he's
dialog: having a heart attack.
text: Snake swerves on Brain's direction. So far so good. A mine goes off,
dialog: but it's behind them.
text: The Duke goes forward. He's going by the seat of his pants. But he
text: knows the general direction of how Snake went. A mine goes off behind
dialog: him, too.
scene_heading: INT. CAB -- NIGHT
text: Brain reads the map. Cabbie continues to freak out.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: You've got to slow down a little, Snake...
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: I think there are three mines ahead, Snake.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You think?!
scene_heading: EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
text: The Duke continues in pursuit.
scene_heading: INT. CAB -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Stay left, stay left, stay left, and then jog right when I tell you.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: You're pushing her too hard, Snake.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: OK, OK, NOW!
scene_heading: EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
text: The cab explodes, being cut right in half. Everyone makes it except
dialog: Cabbie. Cabbie had been driving that very same cab for thirty years.
dialog: He died with it.
text: The President, Snake, Maggie and Brain all keep going on foot.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: I said JOG RIGHT!... you asshole.
text: Brain leads the way as they keep crossing the bridge.
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: Stay to the right, stay to the right, now jog left. Hold it, left...
dialog: left... LEFT, DAMMIT!
text: The other three go right. Brain goes left and a mine explodes under
text: him. Maggie walks up to the body in shock. Snake limps up to her.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Brain...
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Keep moving...
text: The Duke's car is coming. Snake checks his life clock
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Maggie... he's dead. Come on.
text: Maggie calmly holds out her hand. Snake smiles and hands her his gun.
text: His grin grows. It's one of respect for what she's about to do. He
text: runs off after the President.
text: Maggie walks around to Brain, then steps in front of him. She points
text: the gun at the Duke's car. The first three shots don't connect. The
text: fourth nails the headlight, and then the Duke runs her over. He keeps
dialog: going.
scene_heading: INT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Rehme runs up to Hauk and the Vice President.
speaker_heading: REHME
text: Station 19! They spotted two cars on the 69th street bridge.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Is it Plissken?
speaker_heading: REHME
text: Taxicab and a Cadillac. Taxi hit a mine. There's four people on foot.
speaker_heading: VICE PRESIDENT
dialog: Fourteen minutes...
speaker_heading: HAUK
text: Get a jeep with a winch over there fast.
text: He pulls out a phone.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: Strombaerden! Get over to Station 19. They're coming across the
dialog: bridge.
scene_heading: EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
dialog: The President and Snake run on.
scene_heading: EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
text: A jeep pulls up. Rehme's voice comes up over the loudspeaker. The
text: guards on the jeep ready the winch.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: This is Rehme, Security Control. We are in a standby situation.
dialog: Repeat. We are in a standby situation. All helicopters, down. Wall
dialog: guard, do not fire on prisoners. Repeat, do not fire on prisoners. All
dialog: vehicles, stand by. Repeat, stand by.
scene_heading: EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
text: Snake and the President are close enough to the wall to hear all this.
scene_heading: EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
text: The wall guards grab the rope and prepare to lower it for the President
dialog: and Snake.
scene_heading: EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
text: Snake pushes the President up to the wall. The winch comes down and
text: Snake helps the President into it first. The President goes up and
text: over. Snake's life clock reads 1:32. But he doesn't have time to watch
text: seconds tick away because the Duke is right behind him firing at him.
text: Snake ducks for cover. The wall guards die. The winch comes down
text: again, and the Duke sees it. He starts toward it. Snake tackles him
text: and beats him up, dazing him but not knocking him out. He grabs the
dialog: winch.
scene_heading: EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
text: A hand stops the winch from moving.
scene_heading: EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT
text: Snake comes to a stop. He panics and starts pulling on the winch line.
text: The Duke comes to and stands up. But he can't get anywhere because the
text: President has found a machine gun and is now firing away. He is very
text: accurate. He nails the Duke right away but keeps firing.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (manic voice)
dialog: Yeah, hey, Number One! You're the Duke! You're the Duke!
text: The President calms down somewhat.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: You're... the Duke... You're A-Number-One.
text: The President starts the winch again. Snake climbs up and gets over as
text: fast as he can without injuring himself.
scene_heading: EXT. WALL -- NIGHT
text: Hauk and the medic pull up with the machine. Hauk interrupts the medic.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: The tape, Plissken.
text: Snake reaches into his pocket, grabs the tape, and hands it to Hauk. He
text: is furious. As soon as Hauk has the tape, he lets the medic come back.
text: He holds up two medal pads to Snake's neck. They buzz, they buzz
text: louder, and then he takes them away.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: That's it.
text: Snake continues to pant and fume. He stares at them, then lifts his
text: wrist to look at his life clock. 2 seconds. One second.
dialog: Beep.
dialog: Nothing.
text: Snake lowers his wrist.
scene_heading: EXT. PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE SITE -- NIGHT
text: A jeep pulls Rehme up. He jogs to the President, who is being shaved
dialog: and prepared for broadcast.
speaker_heading: REHME
dialog: I radioed ahead, Mr. President. They know the situation. They're
dialog: waiting for your broadcast.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Yeah.
text: Snake approaches. The President nods.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Oh, it's all right.
text: Snake walks up and looks the President straight in the eye.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I, uh... I want to thank you. Anything you want... you just name it.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Just a moment of your time.
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: Three minutes, sir.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: We did get you out. A lot of people died in the process. I just
dialog: wondered how you felt about it.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I want to thank them. This nation appreciates their sacrifice.
dialog: The President is full of shit after all. Snake has reason for his
text: cynicism. The President is uncomfortable with Snake's glare and it
dialog: shows.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Look, uh, I'm on the air in...
dialog: (questioning his aide)
dialog: Two and a half minutes?
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Snake lights a cigarette and walks away. Rehme watches.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE -- NIGHT
text: Snake walks away. Hauk stands nearby. Snake stops in his tracks.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: You going to kill me now, Snake?
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: I'm too tired. Maybe later.
speaker_heading: HAUK
dialog: I've got another deal for you. I want you to think it over while you're
dialog: resting. I want to give you a job. We'd make one hell of a team,
dialog: Snake.
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: (glaring)
dialog: The name's Plissken.
text: He limps away.
scene_heading: EXT. PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE SITE -- NIGHT
text: The President looks suitably freshened up. He's even smiling a little.
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: You're on camera, Mr. President.
