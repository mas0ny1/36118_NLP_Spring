text: Once baked, the HEADS slide out of the back of the kiln. The

text: And then SAFE TO ENTER.

speaker_heading: MAX (CONT’D}
dialog: Hey, asshole. We need to get in.

speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: Clean.
text: The bouncer waves his fat arm without looking at them. The

text: Max knows where he is going, he’s clearly been here before.
text: They finally reach a door leading to a large room, and enter-~-~
scene_heading: INT. SPIDER’S LAIR MISSION CONTROL —- NIGHT
dialog: The mission control is where the illegal shuttles are
text: Launched from. The room is a strange combination of wall-
text: sized plasmas and a favela. Litter and exposed brick next to
text: super computers and monitors displaying flight routes.
text: TEN TECHIE GANGSTERS are working on computers.
text: It is the cpposite of the clean, pristine CCB CONPROL ROOM.
text: We see a MAN orchestrating the scene, he sits in a chair. He
text: leans back throwing a footbali up toward the roof and
text: catching it. This is SPIDER. A walking stick lies next to his
text: chair. One of his legs is paralysed. Despite his disability,

speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: Oh man, that is priceless. You

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: You willing to take a chance then?
dialog: There’s something I always wanted
dialog: to do, but no one had the balls to

text: Spider grabs his walking stick and hobbles over to them.
speaker_heading: JULIO
dialog: I don't like the sound of this.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: INT. SPIDER’S LAIR ARMORY
text: Spider leads them inside. Serious guns and ammo lie all over
text: the place. Spider goes over to a pile of tech and starts
text: cummaging for something. He finally’ pulls out a small device:
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: Here we go.
text: The size of a matchbox, it has a tethered tail of wire caked
text: in old blood. He puts it on the table in front of them.

speaker_heading: SPIDER (CONT'D)
dialog: Sandro will do the surgery, he’s
dialog: good, we do it right here. But
dialog: actually...
text: He xummages through more tech for something. He finds it:
text: A HULC SUIT. A metal exoskeleton that fits to human limbs. It
text: looks like a clump of STEEL, a dirt~bike chassis with joints.
speaker_heading: SPIDER (CONT’D)
dialog: You seem all weak and fucked up, so
dialog: I’d have them install this too,
dialog: you're already under the knife
dialog: right? Ensure mission success.

speaker_heading: SPIDER (CONT’D)

text: MANUEL among them. The fat guard sits with his AK47.
text: FREY approaches the lair. She wears a hoodie over her nurse's
text: uniform. She pulls out a crumpled piece of paper with an
text: address. She looks up at the lair and triple checks the
text: address. She watches the seedy patrons of Spider‘’s world.
text: She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a wad of cash. It's
text: clasped together with a rubber band. She looks down at it.
text: And then puts it back in her hoodie. One of the tatted thugs

speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: What? I just wanted to talk.
text: As Frey turns, she sees a silhouette in one of the windows of
text: the lair. It’s MAX. Their eyes meet. She's not surprised to

dialog: looking for me because of this
dialog: fucking data.
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Some kind of CCB hitman came after
dialog: me. Said he was going to CUT OFF MY
dialog: FUCKING HEAD. For data which
dialog: according to you is apparently
dialog: fucking useless. Explain that,
dialog: genius.
text: Max starts hitting the side of his head.
speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: THIS! This! Stuff in my head.
dialog: Codes, numbers, PROTOCOL, every
dialog: time I think of it, I see it in my
dialog: eyes, like a fucking nightmare!
text: He forces his thumbs into his eyes, as if trying to stop a
text: migraine. Spider looks at him.
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: That‘s.... How can that be.
text: 
text: Spider looks back at the monitors flashing NO FLY INITIATED.
text: He turns back toward Max, putting the pieces together.
speaker_heading: SPIDER (CONT’D)
dialog: We have to see what's in your head.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: I think we may have caused this.
text: Spider hobbles over to a computer console, grabs a long cable
text: and tries to plug it into Max’s head. Max siaps it away.
speaker_heading: SPIDER (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, Max...if they are hunting
dialog: you, don’t you want to know WHY?
text: Max considers. The words resonate. He lowers his hands.
text: Spider plugs in. He fires up a program and the computer scans
text: Max‘s head. Huge monitors display billions of lines of code.
text: 
speaker_heading: SPIDER (CONT'D)
dialog: My god...
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What, what is it?
text: Spider is speechless. He turns to leok at Max.
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: They will hunt you to the edge of
dialog: the earth for this.
text: He slumps back in his chair, stunned by the discovery.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: We could make every human a citizen
dialog: of Elysium. Vhat code gives us the
dialog: power to run their whole system.
text: Max looks down, holding the money he stole.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Humans could live there? Legally?
dialog: Medical? All of it?
text: 
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: Yeah. But I don't give a shit about
dialog: that, have a nice house, whatever.
dialog: I care about the larger picture...
text: WE CONTROL THEM.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: How the fuck do we do that?
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: Well...we fly up there, break into
dialog: the central server and upload this
dialog: into it. This data lets us take
dialog: control of every single Biosphere
dialog: droid. They have no military, no
dialog: police, they only have these

speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: Listen kid, I can appreciate that

dialog: BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No. You're the one who doesn't

speaker_heading: MAX (CONT’D}
dialog: I don’t give a shit about your

text: Max throws the chair out of the way and starts leaving.
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: You selfish sonofabitch. You hold
dialog: the key to flipping the whole
dialog: system, and you don’t have the
dialog: balls to man up and do it!
text: Max rips the door open to leave, we see Spider clumsily grab

speaker_heading: SPIDER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! Don’t you leave! Where are you
dialog: genna go? Huh? Go curl up under a
dialog: bridge somewhere? YCU NEED ME!
text: Spider tries to stop Max, his uncoordinated hands feverishly
text: clawing for a grip on Max‘s chest. However, with a very fast
text: sleight of hand he sticks a tracking microchip on Max's HULC.
text: Max effortlessly pushes him back across the room, sending him
text: erashing into tables, computers. Max points to his own head,
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: If they want this thing so fucking
dialog: bad?

speaker_heading: MAX (CONT'D)
dialog: Then they will cut me a deal,

speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: Or WHAT?
text: Max leans down to the knocked-out guard, pulis a grenade off

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Or I'll blow it up.
text: Max walks out, Spider yells from the floor.
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: Come back here! You can’t give that

speaker_heading: SPIDER (INTO WALKIE) (CONT’D)
dialog: Stop him!
scene_heading: INT. SPIDER’S LAIR - VARIOUS
text: We hear SPIDER'S crunchy RT voice echo off gangsters’
text: walkies. They attempt to step Max as he leaves, but--
text: He effortlessly takes them out, using the super-strength of |
text: the HULC, his metal enhanced Limbs flashing in the shadows.
text: Max leaves bodies in his wake. He turns a corner and faces:
text: A sea of destitute people.
dialog: Refugees waiting for Spider to save them. Fach one needing a
text: ticket to the land of salvation. They look at Max, deep into
text: his eyes. A big beat, and...Max starts walking through them.
text: We can hear Spider YELLING through the open door.
speaker_heading: SPIDER
dialog: They will NEVER bargain with you,
dialog: IDIOT. YOU'RE A DEAD MAN!
