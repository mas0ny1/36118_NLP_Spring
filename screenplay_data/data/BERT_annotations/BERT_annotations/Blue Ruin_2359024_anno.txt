text: He tries a side door near a dumpster. Locked.
text: A DOOR SPRING. A WOMAN'S VOICE. A CLINKING CHAIN.
text: Dwight follows the wall towards the sound, peeking one eye
text: beyond the edge of the building.
text: Hope is crouched by the rear entrance, opening cellar doors
text: as the Teddy rolls a BEER KEG from a gated cold-storage unit.

text: Dwight TUNES OUT, drawn to a DISTANT RUMBLE above.
text: IN THE SKY: a drifting contrail in the wake of a jet...
text: The cellar doors swing SHUT.
text: Dwight pivots around the corner- they’re gone.
text: He slips inside the back door.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 66
text: From bright daylight into a black cave.
text: AUTO-TUNED RAP SWELLS as Dwight navigates the memorabilia-
text: lined hallway, his eyes adjusting to the darkness.
text: TRACKING BEHIND DWIGHT, as he reaches in his pocket and pulls
text: out the CORK HANDLED FISHING KNIFE.
text: He passes the kitchen, steadying himself against the wall,
text: nearly knocking off a framed picture. He presses his hand to
text: a door and it swings open...
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 67
text: It’s a cramped, dingy-tiled bathroom bisected by a narrow
text: walkway. On one wall: two stalls and a trash can. On the
text: other: two urinals and a stickered-up mirror mounted above a
text: porcelain sink.
text: Dwight crosses the walkway and turns to face the door.
text: He adjusts the blade in his hand.
text: The MUSIC lowers, then blasts LOUDER.
text: ON DWIGHT, inching towards the door- VOICES from just beyond
text: it stop him short.
dialog: 18.
text: The Convict and Carl push through the door, drinking from
text: plastic cups.
speaker_heading: CONVICT
dialog: Naw, man- she just talks too much.
dialog: Shit- I ain’t used to that.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: She talks shit, or she just talks
dialog: too much?
text: IN THE FAR STALL, Dwight stands silent, shadowed.
speaker_heading: CONVICT
dialog: (jokingly fed up)
dialog: Motherfucker.
text: The two men place their cups atop the urinals and relieve
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What, me too?
speaker_heading: CONVICT
dialog: Yeah, maybe just let me piss.
dialog: Haven’t done it alone with four
dialog: walls in over a decade.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Ha, dude.
text: They share a bit of a laugh then urinate in silence. Carl
text: Finishes up and ZIPS.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey, man. You all right?
speaker_heading: CONVICT
dialog: Got some shit lined up. Favors.
text: Carl walks to the door.
speaker_heading: CONVICT (CONT’D)
dialog: You ain’t gonna wash up?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Naw, man, I don’t piss on my hands.

dialog: You want another one? Or you want

speaker_heading: CONVICT
dialog: All that shit...
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I hear that.
text: The door swings shut behind Carl.
text: The Convict lets out a deep breath, passes some gas.
text: He zips up, his face expressionless as he steps to the sink
text: across from the far stall. Dwight is three feet from the
text: Convict, DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM.
text: The Convict pumps soap, scrubs his hands.
text: INSIDE THE STALL, Dwight watches, sweaty, seething.
text: ON THE FISHING KNIFE, Dwight nervously auditions hand grips.
text: ON DWIGHT’S contorting face. The MUSIC IS LOUD.
text: The convict splashes his face and inspects his pores in the
text: mirror- his jaw tenses as his EYES LOCK ON A REFLECTION IN
text: THE STALL BEHIND HIM.
text: Counterbalanced by fear and rage, Dwight’s thrust is almost
text: lethargic. The Convict whirls around as the stall door pushes
text: open- DWIGHT SWINGS THE FISHING KNIFE, CUTTING A DEEP SLICE
text: INTO THE BACK OF THE CONVICT’S NECK.
text: The Convict fails to register the wound and rushes Dwight,
text: grabbing him by the throat with jailhouse power, forcing him
text: against the stall.
speaker_heading: CONVICT
text: THE FUCK? MOTHERFUCKER.
text: IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THEM, we see the severity of the
text: Convict’s wound, LIKE A BLOODY GILL, AS IT RAPIDLY OVERFLOWS
text: WITH DARK RED FLUID.
text: Dwight gasps in the Convict’s two-handed clench, flailing,
text: WEAKLY JABBING THE KNIFE INTO THE CONVICTS RIBS.
speaker_heading: CONVICT (CONT’D)
speaker_heading: C'MON, LET’S...
text: DWIGHT RAISES THE FISHING KNIFE AND THRUSTS IT DOWNWARD INTO
text: THE CONVICT’S SKULL. The Convict lets out an open-mouthed
text: GRUNT, the KNIFE PLANTED IN THE TOP OF HIS HEAD.
text: Enraged, with shock setting in, the Convict throws Dwight
text: towards the still-running sink, then to the floor.
text: They slip and flail, bathed in blood. Dwight takes a beating
text: until the Convict BLEEDS OUT, clutching Dwight’s shirt.
dialog: 20.
text: Dwight pushes off with his feet, his SHIRT RIPPING as he
text: disentangles from the Convict, who crumples to the floor,
text: wheezing. He stares at Dwight, a hint of recognition.
speaker_heading: CONVICT (CONT’D)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Do I know you?
text: Dwight stares back.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Yes.
text: Dwight ramps into hyperventilation.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: YES.
text: He leans over the Convict, YANKS THE KNIFE FROM HIS SKULL.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: YES!
text: Unhinged, Dwight STABS THE CONVICT REPEATEDLY IN THE CHEST.
text: Then collapses, completely spent.
text: SOMEONE POUNDS ON THE DOOR.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (0.S.)
dialog: (muffled, through door)
dialog: Hurry the fuck up, man! Party’s for

speaker_heading: TEDDY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (projecting further away)
text: WHAT? HELL NO! HE’S PROBABLY
speaker_heading: BEATIN’ OFF.

speaker_heading: TEDDY (0.S.) (CONT'D)

text: As Dwight exits, the sunlight is blinding.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY BAR - DAY 69
text: Dwight treads heavily towards the Bonneville, past the

text: He leaves the knife in the FIZZLING tire, HIS HAND DRIPPING
text: BLOOD TOWARDS HIS CAR.
scene_heading: INT. BONNEVILLE - HIGHWAY BAR - DAY 70

speaker_heading: NO KEYS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Hi, Mrs. Galicia. I’m looking for

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No, he moved a while ago.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Okay. I’m Dwight, from Orange High.
dialog: I just...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh! I’m so sorry- you had me a

dialog: (a rush of sympathy)

text: Dwight deflects with a polite nod.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Oh, he doesn’t know I’m coming-
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (gesturing to sit)
dialog: Oh he’1l be thrilled...
text: He watches her as the line TONES.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT’D)
dialog: (hanging up)

dialog: probably playing tonight...
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Richmond?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes. I never remember the name.
dialog: It’s not a nice place...
text: She passes a finger along POST-ITS, MAGNETS and PHOTOS

text: from under a magnet and brings her address book to the table.
text: Dwight watches her pencil information onto the card and into
dialog: her book.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT’D)
dialog: This way...we can both have

dialog: myself...
dialog: (pointing to the card)

scene_heading: FIVE DOLLARS.

speaker_heading: ROCK GIRL (CONT'D)
text: HOLD ON...

scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - MUSIC VENUE - NIGHT 170

scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY - MUSIC VENUE - NIGHT (LATER) 172

text: There’s a DUMPSTER across the alley. He walks over, places
text: his hand on the rim and rises onto tip-toes. He peeks in-

speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Ben?

speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: BEN!

speaker_heading: DWIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Ben. Hey, it’s Dwight. Evans.
text: The Large Man, BEN, walks over, assessing the claim. Dwight
text: meets him at the tailgate and they shake.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Wow, bro- you look square.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I’ve been away.
text: Ben nods, waiting for more.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No shit, man- just peaced-the-fuck-

text: He pulls out cigarettes, Dwight declines and Ben lights up.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Same year El Duce got hit by a
dialog: train.
dialog: (slaps his truck)
dialog: Yo, I put the first two hundred
dialog: miles on this thing stapling up
dialog: your ‘missing’ posters.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: (struck, ashamed)
dialog: Never thought of that.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Your sister, man. She was hell

speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Was...that you?
dialog: (pointing back)
dialog: By the dumpster?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah... So should we get beers?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Look, I need to warn you that I’m
dialog: here- that I came to you- for a
dialog: favor. A big one.
text: Ben reaches in his jacket, SILENCING HIS HEADPHONES.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Sure. What do you need?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I need a gun. And I don’t have a
dialog: lot of time to get it. You were the
dialog: only person I could trust.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Whoa.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: And has guns.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (taking a drag)
dialog: Shit, man- you can pretty much buy
dialog: one anywhere.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I tried to get one on my own. I
dialog: don’t have any money- wait...
dialog: (digging crumpled bills
dialog: from his pocket)
dialog: I mean, I’ve got- but my I.D. is-

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah. Hop in brother.
text: Ben heads to his truck.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I should take my car...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You gassed up? I’m in the boonies.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 175

scene_heading: EXT. BEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT 176
text: The two vehicles pull past a shotgun shack up to a single

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - BEN’S HOUSE - PRE-DAWN 177
text: HALLWAY LIGHTS CLICK ON. Ben leads Dwight into the sparse,

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Hey- I got something..
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: What’s that?
text: Ben opens a JUNK DRAWER in a old bureau, rifles through it.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You remember when James Henry’s
dialog: brother had the stripper at his
dialog: party? At his shop?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Haven't thought that far back in a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I got a Polaroid of me and you with
dialog: the stripper. It’s hilarious- we’re
text: both terrified.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Ben. I need to hurry.
text: Ben nods, shoving the drawer closed, turning to two METAL
text: LOCKERS along the wall.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you hunt?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Very little.
text: Ben pulls a MAGNETIC BOX from behind a locker, shaking out
text: KEYS and turning them in the locks.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: More into target shooting. What do
dialog: you need it for?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I’d rather...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh- no, man. The less I know, the
dialog: better. What do you need out of the
dialog: gun. At range? Close quarters?
text: Dwight stands at a loss as Ben swings open the doors.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Close up or far away?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Probably close. I don’t know.
dialog: Hopefully not at all.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Roger that. See what I’ve got...
text: (running his hand along
dialog: the racks)
dialog: An Enfield mark three, Circuit
dialog: Judge, a Mosin...
text: He pulls out a vintage BOLT-ACTION RIFLE, feeling the weight.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: ..-which is my current favorite.
dialog: Bolt action, heavy, and the surplus
dialog: ammo is cheap.
text: He sets it on the bed and wipes his nose.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: The AK, Mossberg- might be a bit
dialog: much. What do you weigh?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Don’t know.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: ...the Sterling might jam up on
dialog: you.
text: Ben pulls out a VINTAGE SUB MACHINE GUN.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: It’ll clear a room, though. Ah.
text: He replaces the sub machine gun, removing a bulky automatic
text: pistol from the cabinet.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I picked this up this year. Steyr
dialog: nineteen-twelve. Shoots it’s own
dialog: nine mil cartridge, great shape-
dialog: but you gotta load it slide-back
text: with a stripper clip.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Nothing that’s special to you- the
dialog: least expensive, as long as it
dialog: works...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: The World War I and II models are
dialog: bring-backs- no papers, no import
dialog: marks. But you don’t want a bolt-
dialog: action...
text: Dwight stews in ignorance. Ben reads it, selecting a MINI-14
speaker_heading: RIFLE.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Here. The Mini Fourteen. Gunshow-
dialog: no papers. It’s a carbine- that
dialog: just means it’s short. Semi-auto-
dialog: it fires every time you pull the
dialog: trigger- twenty rounds. Very
dialog: reliable. Plus, I got ammo here.
dialog: 61.
text: Ben expertly loads a clip and assumes a firing position, his
text: trigger finger extended against the guard.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Recognize it?
text: Dwight shakes ‘no’.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s the A-Team gun. From the show.
dialog: Their’s were stainless...
text: Ben presents the rifle. Dwight grabs it, but Ben holds firm.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: What’s up with that?
text: Dwight follows Ben’s gaze to a BLOOD STAIN on his SHIRT AND
speaker_heading: PANTS.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Oh, that’s not- it’s from an arrow.
text: It’s stitched up.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Not so well, huh.
text: Ben lets go of the rifle. Dwight feels the weight.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: So then, you’re already in this?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Yes.
text: Ben locks eyes with sincere concern.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Because I was just blowing smoke up
dialog: your ass, bro. Preparing a speech
dialog: in my head to stop you from
dialog: whatever crazy shit you’re about to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: It’s already done...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Thought about calling the cops.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Please don’t. Not yet. I don’t have
dialog: a speech- just please trust me.
dialog: 178
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I do, bro. But I can’t send you off
dialog: like this. I could teach you. CQB,
dialog: man! Surprise, speed, violence of
dialog: action...
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I just need somewhere quiet right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I’ve got sixteen acres. Follow the
dialog: road we came in on ‘till it ends-
dialog: you'll see the targets.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You right handed?
text: Dwight nods ‘yes’.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Real quick. Keep the safety off.
dialog: Wherever your eyes look, the gun
dialog: follows. And keep your distance- or
dialog: it can get sloppy.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I know. You ever killed anyone?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (shutting the lockers)
text: Two on purpose.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. SECLUDED AREA - BEN’S PROPERTY - EARLY MORNING 178

text: He pockets the CELL PHONE, draws a breath and POPS THE TRUNK.
scene_heading: EXT. BONNEVILE - SECLUDED AREA - EARLY MORNING 180
text: Dwight scurries to the trunk as it’s pushed up by Teddy,
text: emerging disoriented in a sheen of filth and sweat.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Stay in the trunk.
text: Teddy swallows air, squinting in the daylight, seeing the
text: rifle trained on his chest.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: (hoarse)
dialog: That's easy, my leg is broke.
text: Dwight stands mute, the bottle of water by his feet.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (weakly snapping his
dialog: finger)
dialog: That for me?
text: Dwight wiggles a firmer grip around the rifle.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Were you coming for me or for her?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: You came to my sister's house. Who
dialog: were you coming for?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Look, man. You.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Then how come you didn’t just call
dialog: the police? Send me to jail?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Same as you. Keeping it ‘in-house’.
text: Dwight tosses the water bottle, TEDDY snatches it from the
text: air, uncaps it and chugs...
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: What if I surrender?
text: Teddy raises his eyebrows, chugging. He empties the bottle
text: and tosses it to the ground.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: (ecstatic breath)
dialog: I accept.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Please, dammit. To the police- I'll
dialog: plead guilty.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: You don’t get to do what you did
dialog: and just lock yourself up. Shit,
dialog: I'd give you props if he wasn’t my
dialog: brother. Or if he had it coming.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: If Wade didn’t deserve it, then
dialog: nobody ever has.
text: Teddy rubs his face, looks off.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Which one are you, again?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Teddy.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: And who was the boy in the
dialog: limousine?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: You totaled it. That’s my
dialog: livelihood...
text: Dwight waits patiently for the answer.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Just a boy. Not a concern.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: When I let him out, he said
dialog: something about Wade. That he
dialog: didn’t hurt anyone...
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Yeah, well-
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Coupla dead negroes might disagree.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (unsmiling)
dialog: He just meant Wade didn’t kill your
dialog: parents.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Not true.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Well that settles it, then.
text: Dwight anxiously finds a new stance, flushing red.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s how this works, man. The one
text: with the gun gets to tell the
dialog: truth. Problem is, you don’t know
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: (quiet, taunting)
dialog: I should’ve done the time.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: (raising the rifle)
dialog: Are you saying you killed them?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Forget this.
text: Dwight CLICKS THE SAFETY, taking aim at Teddy’s arm.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: (flinching, blurting)
dialog: What‘er you tryin’ to do?! WHAT’ER
dialog: YOU TRYIN’ TO DO!?
scene_heading: DWIGHT SQUEEZES THE TRIGGER - PANG! - AND MISSES.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (exhilarated)
dialog: HOT DAMN! Fish in a barrel!
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: STOP IT!
text: Teddy settles, suppressing a smug grin.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Whatever you're saying, say it.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: I didn’t do it. Wade didn’t do it.
dialog: Our father, Big Wade, shot your
dialog: dad. As was his right.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: His right?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: You don’t fuck with a man’s wife.
dialog: His family.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Whatever my dad did, he did with
dialog: your mom. They made a mistake.
dialog: Togeth-
speaker_heading: TEDDY
text: SHIT’S NOT A MISTAKE.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Whatever it was, both my parents
dialog: are dead-
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Your dad got what he deserved. Your
dialog: mom was just in the car- that was a
dialog: fuckup. I’1l give you that...
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I don’t want your opinion on
dialog: things. If it’s true about Wade-
dialog: why did he...?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Big Wade had cancer. We couldn’t
dialog: let him die in prison. I would've
dialog: done the time, but I had two
dialog: strikes. Would’ve been life with no
dialog: parole. Little Wade could take a
dialog: plea... You smoke?
text: Teddy watches intently as Dwight, lost in thought, lets the
text: rifle barrel drift downward. Dwight pulls out the CELL PHONE.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Call them.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Who’s them? The cops?
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Your family.
text: Teddy gestures for the phone. Dwight cautiously lobs it over,
text: Teddy catches it and checks the screen.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: What do you want me to say?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: We're all going to meet up-
dialog: somewhere public- and it’s going to
dialog: end.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Okay.
text: He dials and waits.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Don’t say my name and don’t say
dialog: anything about a gun. We’re in
dialog: Kentucky.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: (surveying)
dialog: You ever been to Kentucky?
text: Dwight blinks, re-focusing down the rifle sights.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (into cell phone)
dialog: It’s me. Call me back. NOW.
dialog: (to Dwight)
dialog: Not picking up. May I call the
dialog: house?
text: Dwight nods his approval. Teddy dials and waits.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hey. Yeah- shut up. I’m fine...just
dialog: my leg. I’m with him, he’s here.
dialog: Not now, he wants to meet- fine.
dialog: I'll try, but we just went through
dialog: it.
dialog: (to Dwight)
dialog: She wants to talk to you.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: My sister. She’s bossy...
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Throw it.
text: Teddy pivots the phone in his hand, tweaking its position.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: I would- the signal’s weak. We
dialog: can’t blow this- just take it...
text: He extends the phone with one hand.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s fine. You can point that thing
text: right at my face. I’m not moving.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Turn around. Look away.
text: Teddy shifts his weight around, looking back into the trunk.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Keep your finger on the trigger...
text: Dwight approaches, two hands gripping the rifle, pointing it
text: directly at the back of Teddy's head.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s over as far as I’m concerned.
dialog: (towards the phone)
dialog: You hear that, sis?
text: Dwight reaches for the phone, steps on the discarded water
text: bottle. CRUNCH.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
dialog: .--don’t go starting ANY SHIT-
text: TEDDY WHIPS FROM HIS CORE, ARMS SWEEPING BROADLY AROUND,
text: DEFLECTING THE GUN BARREL AS DWIGHT FIRES INTO THE TRUNK.
text: PATANG! TEDDY LAUNCHES FROM THE TRUNK AND TACKLES DWIGHT TO
text: THE GROUND, ELBOWING HIM HARD TO THE FACE.
text: Teddy snatches the gun and SLAMS THE PHONE INTO DWIGHT’S
scene_heading: STUNNED FACE.
speaker_heading: TEDDY (CONT'D)
text: THERE’S NOBODY HOME, STUPID FUCK!
dialog: They’re huntin’...
