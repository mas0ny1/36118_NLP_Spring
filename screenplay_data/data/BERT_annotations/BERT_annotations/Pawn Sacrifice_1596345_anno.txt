scene_heading: EXT. GRANITE COUNTRY HOUSE - ICELAND - DAWN
text: In the grey dawn, a formidable house in the Icelandic
text: wilderness. A single light burns in an upper window.
dialog: Caption: Reykjavik, Iceland 4:15am. July 20th, 1972
text: In the distance, a POLICE CAR approaches, lights flashing.
scene_heading: INT. GRANITE COUNTRY HOUSE - ICELAND
text: CLOSE on a hand gripping the padded arm of an armchair. The
text: index finger of the hand is PICKING at a thread.
text: The HAND belongs to an intense young man with black hair
text: swept back. He sits motionless, peering at a chess game
text: which is a few moves old. The man is BOBBY FISCHER.
text: A SINGLE FLY begins to buzz against the window.
text: Bobby eyes the fly. The movement of his eyes is immense.
text: Murderous. The thread he has been picking at suddenly TEARS
text: with a THUNDEROUS RIPPING SOUND.
text: The fly is trying to get out the window.
scene_heading: BOBBY'S PERCEPTION
text: The BUZZING of the fly is a howling hurricane from hell.
text: BACK TO AN OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE ROOM
dialog: Silence.
text: Bobby stalks the fly -- CRUSHING IT with a coffee cup.
text: He sits back down in a business-like way and stares at the
text: board again, his fingernail beginning to work another thread.
text: HEADLIGHTS sweep the room and we HEAR a car door SLAM.
text: Bobby's face betrays no reaction -- but his whole hand CLAWS
text: the arm of the chair like an animal in a trap.
text: At the SOUND of someone running upstairs, he glances from
text: the chessboard to the door, as a knock comes on the door:
speaker_heading: A7
speaker_heading: B7
scene_heading: Pink Revision 10-01-13 2.
scene_heading: BOBBY'S PERCEPTION 5
text: Someone is POUNDING on the door -- it SOUNDS like the Gestapo
text: in an old war movie.
scene_heading: BACK TO AN OBJECTIVE VIEW 6
text: The knock on the door is polite.
text: Bobby grips the armchair, can't stand the noise that only he
text: can hear -- and he gets to his feet, UPENDING a lamp.
dialog: Another knock.
text: Bobby pinballs around like the fly trying to escape --
text: breaking shutters as he tries to close them, tripping over a
text: table. ANOTHER KNOCK, even louder.
text: Then, just as suddenly, his eyes FOCUS on the chess board.
text: A new light comes into his eyes as he stares at it -- and
text: his breathing begins to slow.
text: ALL SOUND BEGINS TO FADE A7
text: As he moves toward the board -- his fingers reaching out --
dialog: in ultra slo-mo -- to make...a...single...move.
text: BACK TO THE SCENE B7
text: Bobby closes his eyes. Content. He has solved the puzzle.
dialog: CAPTION: This is the true story of Bobby Fischer.
text: The door opens. A guy stands there -- mid-40's, pugnacious.
text: This is MARSHALL. He stares at the debris of the room. And
text: at Bobby, who appears perfectly calm.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: There was a fly. It's dead now.
text: A huge agenda between the two men. Marshall composes himself.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: (quoting)
dialog: "Never before in human history has
dialog: the outcome of an entire global war
text: of ideas rested on the shoulders of
dialog: one man."
text: The slightest smile begins to form on Bobby's lips.
scene_heading: Pink Revision 10-01-13 3.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm quoting the President of the
dialog: United States. He was talking about
dialog: you. Tome. The President of the
dialog: United States talking to me. He
dialog: called three times. Three.
text: Marshall lifts the receiver, places a phone back on the hook.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
dialog: He's been trying to reach you.
text: Bobby refuses to be intimidated. If anything, his smile
text: widens. Marshall rights an upturned chair.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
dialog: In Moscow, Brezhnev opened his only
dialog: bottle of 1868 Louis Roederer. Left
dialog: over from the revolution. You know
dialog: why?
dialog: (hammering it home)
dialog: Because. He. Heard. You Quit.
text: Bobby walks to the window, looks out at the half-light.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL (CONT'D)
dialog: There are boys your age in Vietnam
dialog: giving their lives right now in the
dialog: fight against Communism. And all
dialog: you have to do is win a game of chess.
dialog: (plaintively)
dialog: ...Say something. Bobby, please...
dialog: Bobby?
text: Bobby doesn't answer. Instead, he stares out into the night,
dialog: and we HEAR another voice.
speaker_heading: JOAN (V.O.)
dialog: .. Bobby?
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: IN THE FISCHER APARTMENT - NIGHT - BROOKLYN
text: Bobby, age 8, stands looking out another window. It is 1952.

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Bobby, it's bedtime.
scene_heading: Yellow Revision 10-11-13 4.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That man's out there.
text: Joan looks out. A SEDAN is parked under a streetlight. A
text: LIT MATCH briefly illuminates a MAN'S FACE as he lights a
text: cigarette. Is that a telephoto lens in his hand? She subtly
text: turns him away from the window.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Have you eaten anything? There's
dialog: actually food in the house. Go.
text: Bobby heads back into a party in full swing. The apartment
dialog: is packed with Boho's, Eastern European emigres, NY
text: intellectuals. A banner reads, "Brooklyn-Bed Sty American
text: Communist Party PARTY! Coltrane wails on the record player.
text: BOBBY IS INVISIBLE IN THIS ADULT WORLD
text: Adults LOOM above him, laughing. A MIXED COUPLE making out,
text: open-mouthed. A man smoking reefer smiles beatifically. He
text: pauses to scribble chess notations in his little notebook.
speaker_heading: PARTY GUEST #1
dialog: Half the witnesses they call are

dialog: We agreed he wouldn't know who you

speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: Fine. But that doesn't mean----
scene_heading: Yellow Revision 10-11-13 5.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: --So I don't see the point!
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: The point is--- Christ, just let me
dialog: talk to him, then I'll go...
text: IN THE DIRTY KITCHEN
text: Bobby is making a sandwich. The BALDING MAN approaches.
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: Howdy doody, Bobby...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hullo.
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: Remember me...?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sort of.
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: I'm your Uncle Paul. From Denver.
dialog: How's school?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: Studying hard?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: Ever heard of Physics?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: But you're good in Math?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I guess.
text: The man stares at him -- there's something pregnant and
text: unspoken in his regard -- but also somehow thwarted.
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: I hear you like chess.
dialog: 10
dialog: Yellow Revision 10-11-13 6.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah.
text: He looks around, takes a five dollar bill from his pocket.
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: Here. Buy a new set. Just don't
dialog: tell your mother where it came from...
text: Bobby's eyes widen as he stares at the bill. The man reaches
text: out to HUG him, but Bobby shrinks away. Uncle Paul frowns,
text: settles for patting Bobby on the head and then walks away.
scene_heading: IN THE LIVING ROOM 10
text: A heated discussion of Zionism, the Rosenbergs. Bobby wanders
text: past, looks out the window. The DARK SEDAN is still there.
text: Regina is nearby, deep in conversation -- IN RUSSIAN.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Mama-â€”
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: Not now, honey.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I have to talk to you.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: Honey, it's past your bedtime.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That car's down there again.
text: Regina's antennae go up.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: What car?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You told me to tell you... A red,
text: 1951 Chevy, NY license plate HI62579.
text: Regina apologizes to her friend in Russian, kneels down.
dialog: Yellow Revision 10-11-13 7.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: Honey, it's okay--
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: But you told me--
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: Bobby, you remember what I said about
dialog: not letting them intimidate us?
dialog: Yes, they watch us -- because we
dialog: represent something very threatening
dialog: to them, to the status quo. You
dialog: remember what that is?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (by rote)
dialog: Revolution.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: Yes! And sometimes these bad people
dialog: want to know about our work so they
dialog: spy on us. So if someone comes up to
dialog: you on the street and asks you
dialog: questions about me, or Mommy's
dialog: friends, what do you say?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (by rote)
dialog: I_have nothing to say to you.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: That's my big boy.
dialog: (to Joan)
text: Joanie, he's got mustard on his shirt.
dialog: He has to wear that to school

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Love to.

speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Bedtime for Bonzo.
text: She tickles as she leads him toward the bedroom
dialog: 11
scene_heading: Pink Revision 10-01-13
scene_heading: INT. BOBBY'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Bobby lies in bed, wide awake. We HEAR the noise of the
text: party outside -- loud conversation, boisterous laughter.
dialog: 7A.
dialog: 11
dialog: 12
dialog: 13
dialog: Yellow Revision 10-11-13 8.
text: Bobby stares at the window -- is the man still out there?
text: We feel his anxiety building as he LISTENS INTENTLY to the
text: sound of the shade SLAPPING against the window sill.
text: Suddenly, he sits up, opens a drawer. He works fast -- like
text: someone breaking the rules -- lights a candle -- rolls the
text: wax into balls and stuffs them into his ears.
text: The laughter outside is muted.
text: Bobby stuffs a ball into his other ear. With both ears
text: blocked -- a sudden and wonderful silence!
text: Bobby carries the candle to a CHESSBOARD. In absolute silence
text: he stares at the chessboard. In his hand is the NOTEBOOK.
text: CLOSE on Bobby's face, candlelit, a study in intensity.
text: As Bobby stares at the chessboard, everything else in the
text: room literally begins to disappear. The bed, the crummy
text: dresser -- until all that is left is a boy and a chessboard.
speaker_heading: THE CHESSBOARD 12
text: Pieces move on their own. Multiple exposures. A move yields
text: hundreds of options. The counter offers thousands more.
text: CLOSE on Bobby's face. Ethereal Music. Bliss. Then...
text: THE DOOR TO HIS BEDROOM IS FLUNG OPEN 13
text: Light floods in. Harsh SOUNDS. The spell is broken. The
text: two open-mouthed kissers are looking for a place to fuck.
speaker_heading: KISSING MAN
dialog: Whoopsee-daisy...
dialog: (sees Bobby)
dialog: Sorry, kiddo.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Get out of my room. GET OUT!
text: Regina appears behind them.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: Bobby! Those are our guests!
dialog: (sees his chessboard)
dialog: Jesus, enough already with the chess!
text: She reaches for the board. Pieces fall, ruining the game.
speaker_heading: REGINA (CONT'D)

dialog: Joan--!

dialog: Yellow Revision 10-11-13 9.
text: Joan appears.
speaker_heading: REGINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Put him to bed, will ya?
text: As Regina returns to the party. Joan kneels to pick up the
text: fallen pieces. Bobby looks up at her.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Please...?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Okay. One game.
text: She sits beside him on the bed and sets up the board.
scene_heading: INT. BROOKLYN JEWISH HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY 14
text: Bobby, Joan and Regina sit in a waiting room. Regina smooths
text: Bobby's hair.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: Now Bobby, don't suddenly start acting
dialog: normal and make me look ridiculous...
scene_heading: INT. DR. MENGARINI'S OFFICE - LATER 15
text: On DOCTOR MENGARINI's desk is a LARGE WOODEN CHESS SET.
text: Across the desk we find Bobby. The game is fifteen moves
text: old. Smoke from Megarini's pipe wafts among the chess pieces.
speaker_heading: MENGARINI
dialog: So Bobby, you go to the movies?
dialog: (Bobby nods without
dialog: looking up)
dialog: You like Westerns? Bang, bang?
text: Bobby nods again. Mengarini glances at Regina.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: Bobby, have you ever been to the
dialog: Moon on the subway?
text: Bobby nods and moves a piece. He's in a kind of trance.
speaker_heading: REGINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Once I poured a glass of water over
dialog: his head...
text: Mengarini studies Bobby as Bobby studies the board.
speaker_heading: REGINA (CONT'D)
dialog: If I take the pieces away he just
text: plays in his head. Day and night.
dialog: Yellow Revision 10-11-13
text: Mengarini moves his knight. Bobby counters.
speaker_heading: MENGARINI
dialog: What do you dream about, Bobby?
text: Silence. Regina shrugs. Mengarini takes Bobby's rook.
dialog: 9A.
dialog: Green Revision 10-14-13 10.
speaker_heading: MENGARINI (CONT'D)
dialog: You like Parchesi? Monopoly?
dialog: (to Joan)
dialog: Does he play other games with you?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: He says chess is the only game that
dialog: doesn't need luck.
text: Mengarini has barely finished moving when Bobby makes a move.
text: This startles Mengarini, who frowns at the new positions.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
text: And he cries when he loses.
text: Bobby glares at her briefly then returns his focus to the
text: game. Mengarini squints at the board, then makes his move.
speaker_heading: MENGARINI
dialog: I play chess at quite a high level.
dialog: His game is pretty good. Not
dialog: exceptional, though.
dialog: (magnanimous1ly)
dialog: A draw?
text: Bobby isn't listening. He's in the zone. He initiates an
text: exchange: his Queen takes Mengarini's Bishop.
text: Mengarini grunts, makes another move. Then Bobby pounces.
text: Mengarini tries to escape but the trap has been sprung.
text: After several moves it's clear he's doomed.
text: Mengarini is astonished. Bobby looks up at him -- something
text: new and...well...murderous in his expression.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: He hates draws.
speaker_heading: MENGARINI
dialog: Where the hell did that come from?
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: So now you see.
text: Mengarini is still staring at the board in disbelief.
speaker_heading: MENGARINI
dialog: Who taught him to play like this?
dialog: 16
dialog: 17
dialog: Yellow Revision 10-11-13 11.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I bought him the set. Last year.
speaker_heading: MENGARINI
dialog: Which club does his belong to?
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: He doesn't belong to any club. He
dialog: taught himself.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I need to pee.
text: Joan takes Bobby's hand and leads him out the door.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: So, Doctor. What do you think?
speaker_heading: MENGARINI
dialog: Mrs. Fischer, there are worse things
dialog: than playing chess. Believe me.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: He wants there to be nothing else.
text: Mengarini is now writing on a pad.
speaker_heading: MENGARINI
dialog: I think he should see a professional.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: I thought you were a professional.
text: He hands her the note. "Carmine Nigro, Brooklyn Chess Club."
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN CHESS CLUB, MARSHALL STREET - AFTERNOONT 16
text: Joan and Bobby walk down a Brooklyn street, arriving at a
text: shabby storefront where A Hispanic MAN, 30's, is waiting.
speaker_heading: CARMINE
dialog: You must be the Fischers. I'm Carmine
dialog: Nigro.
dialog: (to Bobby)
dialog: I'm betting you're the chess player.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Bobby, say hello.
text: Bobby mumbles hello. Carmine unlocks the door.
scene_heading: INT. BROOKLYN CHESS CLUB 17
text: As Carmine turns on the lights, we WATCH Bobby's face as the
text: room is revealed -- twenty tables, all with boards set up.
dialog: Yellow Revision 10-11-13 12.
speaker_heading: CARMINE
dialog: Our church. All colors and creeds
dialog: welcome.
text: Bobby walks in as if entering a holy place. The door behind
text: them bursts opens and Regina bustles in.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: Sorry sorry the E train was a
dialog: nightmare -- you must be Camine Nigro
dialog: I'm Regina Fischer. So....?
speaker_heading: CARMINE
dialog: Doctor Mengarini says he's good.
dialog: But most young people don't have the
dialog: concentration to play at this level
dialog: so please don't build up your hopes.
speaker_heading: REGINA
dialog: My 'hopes' are he will give up on
dialog: the damn game if someone beats him.
speaker_heading: CARMINE
dialog: Okay, let's see what we got here...
text: He grabs two chess pieces, one black and one white, holds
text: them behind his back and turns to Bobby.
speaker_heading: CARMINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Choose.
text: TIME CUT: As the game begins, Carmine seems confident. Bobby
text: makes a move that draws him up short.
text: TIME CUT: Bobby's moves grow bolder, Carmine's body language
text: is changing. The fight is on.
text: TIME CUT: Carmine has to use all his wiles. Eventually,
text: though, he begins to win, and soon he has Bobby trapped.
text: Bobby stares at the board, his face reddening. He has lost.
text: He HATES to lose. He pushes his chair back and walks away,
text: fighting back tears. Carmine turns to Regina.
speaker_heading: CARMINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I am officially the twenty-
dialog: fifth best chess player in New York
dialog: City. But he has great potential.
text: Suddenly, a piece is SLAPPED back on the board. Bobby has

speaker_heading: ARBITER

text: Then, into the hall, walks Boris Spassky! Bobby can't help

speaker_heading: BOBBY

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I'm a Republican actually.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Right there, that's why you're a

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Think I don't know that?
text: Across the hall, Boris senses Bobby's gaze. Their eyes meet.
text: We sense the two men have made fatal contact, and one of
text: them must be destroyed. Bobby looks away first.
text: Bobby and Spassky approach their table. The audience APPLAUDS.
text: The two men stand behind their seats. Geller whispers in
text: Boris's ear. Livo Nei hands him a note pad and pen. A third
text: brings him a worksheet, a fourth hands him a glass of water.
text: Lombardy leans in to whisper to Bobby.
speaker_heading: LOMBARDY

text: Boris sits down calmly as Bobby drops into his chair.
text: Bobby is distracted by THE SOUND of a chair scraping. His

scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH - DUSK 74

speaker_heading: MARSHALL

dialog: understands this whole thing better
dialog: than you.
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: We're at war. Only it's not being
dialog: fought by guns and missiles -- not
dialog: yet at least -- it's a war of
dialog: perception. The poor kid from
dialog: Brooklyn taking on the whole Soviet
dialog: Empire. The perfect American story.
speaker_heading: LOMBARDY

dialog: Liked to play ten people at a time.
text: Blindfolded. Then things got a little
dialog: weird. Started having "visions,"

dialog: eventually killed himself in the

dialog: of ladies' shoes.
text: Lombardy takes another sip.
speaker_heading: LOMBARDY (CONT'D)
text: This game is a rabbit hole. After
dialog: only four moves there are more than

dialog: consider, more forty-move games than
dialog: the number of stars in the galaxy,
dialog: more openings, defenses, gambits
dialog: than there are atoms in the universe.
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: It can bring you very close to the
dialog: edge. I've been there. When I was
dialog: twenty-three, I--
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Nice story, father. With respect,
dialog: my question was about Bobby. Could
dialog: he win?
text: Lombardy glares at him.
speaker_heading: LOMBARDY
dialog: If Bobby went for the title it would
dialog: mean traveling around the world
dialog: playing interzonals for three years...
dialog: That's three years in much worse
dialog: places than this one.
dialog: (finishes his whiskey)
dialog: In my opinion he might not make it
dialog: that long.

scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY 76
text: Bobby has slept on the beach. His clothes are rumpled and
text: his hair is wild. As he sits up he sees an odd sight.
text: A hundred yards down the beach, a big black limo has disgorged
text: three MEN. Two are KGB. The third is wearing a Beverly Hills
dialog: hotel bathrobe. It's Boris Spassky, come for his morning
text: swim. The KGB men carry his clothes.
text: Bobby watches, fascinated, as Boris shrugs off his bathrobe
text: and begins an exercise regime. Bobby gets to his knees as
text: Boris walks into the ocean and begins to swim. The KGB guys
text: smoke cigarettes, waiting for Boris to finish.
text: As Boris steps out of the ocean, a KGB guy holds out a towel
text: for him. Bobby leaps to his feet and yells...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hey!! Asshole!! They're not
dialog: bodyguards, they're jailers!! They've
dialog: got your brain. They're inside your
dialog: mind! They wouldn't even let you
dialog: kill yourself if you wanted!!
text: Boris looks up as Bobby yells, but he is far away and looks
text: like a bum, so he doesn't immediately recognize him...
speaker_heading: KGB GUY
text: Just some drunk sleeping it off.
dialog: America is full of them.
text: Bobby, meanwhile, is laughing to himself. He steps into the
text: ocean, fully clothed, and begins to splash around...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Look at me man, I'm free!
text: He jumps into the waves and begins to play. Boris stares and
text: slowly realizes it's Bobby.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm coming for you, man!! Better
dialog: get ready -- 'cause I'M...COMING!!
text: The KGB minders quickly hustle Boris away, but not before he
text: looks back to see Bobby take a sardonic bow.
text: We might notice something new in Boris's eyes when he realizes
text: that Bobby has recovered from the loss. He is unnerved.
