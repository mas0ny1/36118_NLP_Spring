dialog: July 23, 2013
text: FADE IN... on a 16 mm. FILM PROJECTOR, circa 1944. We are:
scene_heading: INT. FIELD TENT - LOCATION UNKNOWN - EVENING (JUNE, 1944)
text: US ARMY MAJOR FURNISS mans the projector as he briefs 100
scene_heading: UNIFORMED MEN - Sergeants, Lieutenants - in a FIELD TENT:
speaker_heading: MAJOR FURNISS
dialog: Gentlemen. The footage you're about
dialog: to see was intercepted on its way to
dialog: Berlin, intended for Himmler. Command
dialog: is giving it highest priority.
text: Film feeds through the projector, then on to a screen--
text: ON THE SCREEN - We see a large LAB, location unknown. Facing
text: the camera MOS is DOCTOR HUGO BRUEL: 50, beaming proudly.
speaker_heading: MAJOR FURNISS (CONT'D)
text: The doctor and his subjects are
text: unknown. G-2 believes the lab is
text: somewhere in Normandy.
text: ON THE SCREEN - Behind Bruel is a row of NAKED HUMAN SUBJECTS
text: on HOSPITAL BEDS. Bruel, syringe in hand, approaches one--
text: REVERSE TO FURNISS' MEN - watching... as something on the
text: screen shocks them. We drift along the rows in this tent,
text: face after face - American soldiers, aghast, sickened. Then:
text: We land on SERGEANT GUY RENSIN. He's a Jumpmaster, leather-
text: tough, unflappable. But even he is tightening as he watches
text: that screen - has to swallow hard to keep from gagging.
speaker_heading: MAJOR FURNISS (CONT'D)
dialog: Your men needn't know about this;
dialog: liberating France is burden enough.
dialog: But if you find that lab tonight,
dialog: Command wants it and all of its
text: assets SEIZED, including the Doctor.
dialog: 
text: We PUSH IN ON RENSIN - disgust on his face - as:
speaker_heading: MAJOR FURNISS (CONT'D)
dialog: His "experiment" could damn well mean
dialog: our losing this war. And maybe the
dialog: free world.
text: The 16 mm. film runs out. Rensin nods soberly. We CUT TO:
text: Darkness. Silence. An uncomfortable stillness...
text: Then the sound of BOOTS on gravel - as we SMASH TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD - DEVONSHIRE, ENGLAND - NIGHT (JUNE, 1944)
text: American boys, PARATROOPERS of the 82ND AIRBORNE, heading for
text: death itself - eyes down, throats tight, no one talking - as
text: they're herded toward idling C-47's on an English airstrip.
text: Sgt. Rensin now stands at the CARGO DOOR of one of the C-
text: 47's. On its nose is a drawing of a Betty Grable body and the
text: words "My Gal Val". Rensin barks at us:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: Let's move! Let's move! Keep up with
dialog: your stick!
text: SUPER: "Slapton Sands, Uppottery England. June 5, 1944"
text: THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS marching toward HUNDREDS OF PLANES.
dialog: Untested young men, here to save Europe from the Nazis -
text: among them we find PFC. ED BOYCE. He's 24. And terrified.
text: Boyce is from Des Moines, used to be a mechanic; his faith in
text: God runs bone-deep. But he's just a boy, and he knows it.
text: His face charcoaled black, his breaths shallow, he keeps pace
text: with his "stick" - the 18 GUYS he'll be jumping with - each
text: bearing 120 pounds of gear. It's nearly MIDNIGHT.
text: They pass by BRITISH SOLDIERS of an ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERY who
text: salute - a few of them crying; that gets Boyce's attention.
text: He and his stick reach Rensin at the CARGO DOOR of that C-47.
dialog: Every paratrooper needs to be pushed into the plane by fellow
dialog: soldiers (the gear they carry is that heavy.)
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN (CONT'D)
dialog: In! In! In! Let's go! We're dropping
dialog: in on Herr Hitler this evening!
text: Boyce arrives at the cargo door. The soldier who just climbed
text: aboard in front of him turns with a confident grin:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Need a hand, Ed?
text: Meet CPL. LEWIS FORD, offering his hand as if he were helping
text: us onto a trolley on Main Street. Ford is 27, from Brooklyn,
text: matinee-idol handsome, unshakable - even now.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Thanks, Lew.
text: Ford is Boyce's idol, since Basic. Boyce takes his hand. Ford
text: pulls. Two Soldiers behind Boyce push. Then:
scene_heading: INT. C-47 - FUSELAGE - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: Boyce takes his seat on a bench lining the fuselage wall -
text: among a dozen SILENT PARATROOPERS, so wedged in that nobody
text: can move, each man bearing that same 120 pounds of gear:
text: They carry grenades, mines, rifles, .45's, TNT, bayonets,
dialog: rations, main and emergency parachutes, musette bags. Ford,
text: beside Boyce, checks Boyce's gear. Boyce pale with fear.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Hey. This is what we came here for.
dialog: (re: Boyce's gear)
dialog: You're good. Me?
text: Boyce checks Ford's gear - including the DETONATOR on Ford's
dialog: belt - but they both know he's good to go.
text: MORE PARATROOPERS board. Ford casually taps the shoulder of
scene_heading: PFC. JULIAN ROSENFELD (from Oak Park, Illinois).
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Rosenfeld. Cigarettes for chocolate?
text: Rosenfeld ponders it... as PFC TYLER GRIEB looks on, amused.
speaker_heading: GRIEB
dialog: Ford, you must love chocolate.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: It's to win over the locals.
dialog: (to Rosenfeld: )
dialog: Deal?
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: Sure.
text: Done - cigarettes for chocolate. Boyce eyes them with wonder:
dialog: “How can you be so nonchalant?! We're about to DIE." Then--
text: A MEDIC stumbles clumsily aboard, his helmet falling off.
text: This is D.F. GRUNAUER. He grabs the helmet, finds a seat...
text: well aware that he's being stared at. By everyone.
text: PFC. PETE GURKIN (23, from Houston) eyes Grunauer... then:
speaker_heading: GURKIN
dialog: What happened to Briggs?
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER
text: He fell outside the PX, broke his
dialog: ankle. So they reassigned me. Name's
dialog: D.F. Grunauer.
text: No one's saying, "Welcome aboard!" So Ford extends a hand:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Lew Ford.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Ed Boyce.
text: Grunauer shakes their hands, gratefully. But PRIVATE LYLE
text: TIBBET, (24, from Cincinnati, an asshole), chimes in:
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Hold it, hold it. We're jumpin' with
dialog: a Medic from the JV team?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: It's okay. Just don't get shot.
text: Some tight laughs, even from Grunauer. The whole stick is
text: aboard now. Jumpmaster Rensin climbs in - shouting:
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: In your seats, Ladies.
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER
dialog: What's our target, Sarge?
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
text: Radio-jamming tower on top of a
dialog: church in Cielblanc. Gotta knock it
dialog: down so our planes can give air cover
dialog: to the invasion forces comin' off the
dialog: beaches. Command wants it destroyed
dialog: by 0-900.
text: .»+.-as Ford pulls a SILK MAP from his coat, showing Grunauer
text: the beaches of NORMANDY... Omaha, Juno... leading to ROAD
text: 13... leading to a tiny dot: the village of CIELBLANC--
speaker_heading: PFC. DAWES
dialog: Figures the Nazis'd put it on top of
dialog: a church. Godless bastards. They
dialog: outlawed Christmas, ya know.
text: That's MORTON DAWES, from Portland. Boyce shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: That tower is the lynchpin of the
dialog: Jerries' local air-defense. If it
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN (CONT'D)
dialog: isn't down by the time our airstrikes
dialog: begin at 0-900, the result is gonna
dialog: be a lot of lost planes and dead
dialog: G.I.'s never makin' it off those
dialog: beaches. We can expect it to be
dialog: defended aggressively. Understood?
dialog: (no one speaks...)
dialog: Synchronize your watches. It's
dialog: exactly midnight on my mark... Mark.
dialog: 
text: Every paratrooper just synchronized his watch...
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Gurkin, Grieb - you got your
dialog: explosives?
speaker_heading: GURKIN/GRIEB
dialog: Yes, Sergeant!
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: Ford! You got your detonator?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Yes, Sergeant!
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: Rosenfeld! You got the spare?
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: Yes, Sergeant!
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: Keep a tight grip on it, Rosenfeld.
speaker_heading: PFC. DAWES
dialog: Yeah, pretend it's your pecker.
text: Dawes and Rosenfeld are pals. So Rosenfeld chuckles, as:
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: If you wouldn't mind, I'm tryin' to
dialog: win a war here.
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: Lemme hear your crickets.
text: The guys pull DIME-STORE METAL CRICKETS from their trousers —
text: testing them out: CLICK-CLACK, CLICK-CLACK.
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Everybody know the checkwords?
text: The guys nod. Rensin hands out a PILL to each guy.
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN (CONT'D)
dialog: These are for air-sickness. Take 'em.
text: The men look thrown, but they do as told - except for Ford,
text: who crushes his pill under his boot - unseen by Rensin.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: You're not gonna take it?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: They make you sleepy. You wanna sleep
dialog: through this?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: The truth?
text: Ford smiles fondly. Rensin pulls a MEMO from his jacket:
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: From General Eisenhower: "Soldiers,
dialog: Sailors, and Airmen of the Allied
dialog: Expeditionary Force! You are about to
text: embark upon Operation Overlord, the
dialog: Great Crusade toward which we have
dialog: striven these many months. The eyes
dialog: of the world are upon you. Good Luck!
dialog: And let us beseech the blessing of
dialog: Almighty God upon this great and
dialog: noble undertaking."
text: That lands on the somber faces in here...as the C-47 lurches
text: forward, bouncing noisily. Taxiing...
text: Boyce lowers his head in prayer, his eyes shut tight (several
text: of the men in here do likewise). Ford regards him, then:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Send up an extra one for me, will ya
dialog: Ed? So I'm covered?
scene_heading: EXT. AIRSTRIP - ABOVE THE C-47 - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: We look down on the plane as it taxis, engines roaring. It
text: comes to a stop, third in line for take-off.
scene_heading: INT. C-47 - FUSELAGE - RESUMING
text: ENGINE NOISE fills the air. The bench beneath us shakes as
text: the plane in front of us takes off. Boyce keeps praying.
text: Ford pulls a GREASE PENCIL from his trousers, leans forward,
text: and writes something on the fuselage floor - as this bulky
text: beast begins to move again, accelerating down the runway.
dialog: 
text: Most of the paratroopers are praying now. We bounce around,
text: catching glimpses of PFC. CHASE, Gurkin, and Rosenfeld:
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE
dialog: God, just let me hit the ground
dialog: safely. I'll take it from there.
speaker_heading: GURKIN
dialog: Lord, Thy will be done, but if I am
dialog: to die tonight, please let me die
text: like a man.
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: I'll be home soon, Ma.
text: Everything rumbling, bouncing, every paratrooper tight. We
text: land on Boyce, as his eyes open... and he sees what Ford just
dialog: wrote on the floor of this fuselage:
dialog: "82nd Airborne. We came to liberate France. June 5, 1944."
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Amen.
text: The C-47 hits lift-off speed. Boyce petrified. Ford's a rock.
text: The C-47 lifts off. Loud and clunky. Men rock back. On each
dialog: face: "This is it - not a training run. The German Army's
text: waiting out there." The C-47's walls now feel like paper.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Think it's time we made our swap.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Yeah, okay.
text: Boyce pulls a BULKY ENVELOPE from his jacket, addressed to
dialog: "Mr. & Mrs. Irvin Boyce" with an address in Des Moines. (The
text: plane is rising now - 50 feet, 100 feet, 200 feet - LOUDLY.)
text: Ford pulls out a bulky envelope that reads "Mrs. Arthur
text: Ford," with an address in Brooklyn. They exchange envelopes.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Threw my class ring in there, figured
dialog: they'd want it. You?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: My Old Man's lighter. Promised my ma
dialog: she'd get it back in one piece.
text: Boyce nods. Ford looks around... at the faces inside this
text: plane - young boys scared out of their wits, grim as hell.
text: It offends him, for reasons he can't even articulate. So:
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya know what? Hell with this.
text: He grabs his own envelope back from Boyce, and hands the
text: other envelope back to Boyce.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Nobody's dyin' tonight. I won't have
dialog: it.
text: That's that. The C-47 climbs noisily, as:
scene_heading: EXT. C-47 - ABOVE THE AIRFIELD - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: "My Gal Val" takes its place in an ARMADA, filling the
text: English sky: 432 planes in a V-OF-V's-FORMATION, tightly
text: bunched, occupying 300 miles of airspace. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. C-47 - FUSELAGE - FLYING - LATER NIGHT
text: Cold and drafty in here. Some guys sleep; most just stare.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Where ya from, Grunauer?
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER
dialog: Miami. You?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Des Moines, Iowa.
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER
dialog: Oh yeah? You a farmer?
text: Ford chuckles every time Boyce has to answer that.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: No. Worked at a filling station.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: "Biggest one in all Des Moines." Tell
dialog: him, Ed; it's practically a landmark.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Darn right. What's D.F. stand for?
text: Grunauer hesitates. He's taken a lot of shit for his name.
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER
dialog: ...Derwin Frances.
text: A few guys snicker, Grunauer tightening - so:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Coulda been worse. Coulda stood for
dialog: “Der Fuhrer."
text: Grunauer laughs, Ford keeping it all light.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I got a cousin in Miami. He--
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Hey, Boyce. Why you always chattin'
dialog: everybody up all the time? This ain't
text: a cruise-ship.
text: Ford's reaction is instant: THE ICIEST GLARE OF ALL TIME: Do
dialog: not mess with Boyce or you are messing with ME. It lands -
text: Tibbet instantly retreating:
speaker_heading: TIBBET (CONT'D)
dialog: Chat away. See if I give a damn.
text: Ford is the Alpha in this stick. Silence hovers... until:
speaker_heading: PFC. DAWES
dialog: Hey. Look at that:
text: Dawes just saw something, out the cargo door (it's open). A
dialog: sight that takes everybody's breath away:
text: 1,000 feet below us. The English Channel. Alive with wakes.
text: ...because there are 6,000 ARMED VESSELS sailing across it.
dialog: 
text: This is the D-DAY INVASION FLEET, the greatest (and largest)
text: amphibious force ever assembled. Destroyers, gunboats, troop
text: transports - blanketing the channel.
text: And we see awe on the faces in here - a sense of being a part
text: of something massive and historic. Pride too.
speaker_heading: DAWES
dialog: Look out, Hitler!
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Hitler's dead.
dialog: (everybody turns...)
dialog: He just don't know it yet.
text: That sums it up. The men nod, encouraged.
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: We're gonna be the first G.I.'s on
dialog: European soil since this dust-up
dialog: began - so let's make an impression.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN (CONT'D)
dialog: NO prisoners. You see ANYTHING German
dialog: you fire on it.
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: Happy to.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (as if making a note:)
dialog: "Fire at Germans." Got it.
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: Ford...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Yes, Sarge?
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: Anything happens to me tonight,
dialog: you'll be in command. I expect you to
dialog: keep your temper in check.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Sure thing, Sarge - long as nobody
dialog: ticks me off.
text: Rensin breathes out a laugh.
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: Just make sure that tower comes down.
text: Ford nods soberly. Then, that fast, everything goes GRAY.
text: We just plunged into a CLOUD. Gray all around us, like being
text: in a vaccuum. The men tighten, anxiety droning.
text: Then, new sounds, in the distance. DEEP THUDS and the CRACKLE
dialog: of TRACER-FIRE, which means we're crossing over the French
dialog: border, where the Germans are. And they have been waiting:
scene_heading: EXT. C-47 - FLYING - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: The C-47 now plods into SEARCHLIGHT BEAMS from GERMAN ANTI-
text: AIRCRAFT BATTERIES on the ground. That fast, 20 MM. SHELLS go
text: shrieking into the sky, right at us.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. C-47 - FUSELAGE - FLYING - RESUMING
text: BOOM. BOOM. Shells explode right outside this craft, jolting
text: the beast back and forth. It creaks, it whines. The men keep
text: their eyes down. Boyce too. No one talking.
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: Just a little chop, Ladies! Jerry
dialog: saying hello, nothin' to write home
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN (CONT'D)
text: about. We sit tight until the jump-
text: lights go on.
text: He's pointing to the LIGHTS above the CARGO-BAY DOOR. One's
text: red, the other's green. Both are OFF now. Boyce eyes them.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: We stick together, awright?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: You won't hafta look to find me.
scene_heading: INT. C-47 - COCKPIT - FLYING - SAME
text: LT. DAVE McKEAN, our pilot, looks right and left - can't see
text: ANYTHING but gray. Neither can his CO-PILOT or NAVIGATOR.
text: We're shuddering, bouncing, like flying inside a blender.
text: Then a brilliant, horrible BLAST turns everything WHITE.
text: It's FLAK from those German batteries, exploding all around
text: us now. BURSTS of it erupt outside the cockpit window,
text: jarring us badly. The C-47 shudders; noise fills the sky.
text: Everything just ratcheted up in a hurry. McKean panicking:
scene_heading: LT. MCKEAN
dialog: What's our time to drop-zone?!
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR (LT. GALLEY)
dialog: I don't know, Skip! I can't get a
dialog: fix!
text: On the dash is a button, the JUMP-LIGHT. It's got three
text: settings: OFF, RED, and GREEN. McKean eyes it... then:
scene_heading: LT. MCKEAN
dialog: I'm breaking formation.
text: He DESCENDS 100 feet in a hurry and YOKES to the left, away
dialog: (presumably) from the other planes in the V.
scene_heading: INT. C-47 - FUSELAGE - FLYING - RESUMING
text: The beast jerks to the left - sending every man tumbling.
text: Sound and fury shaking this crate like a toy, everyone's
text: stomach dropping in the rapid descent. Then we level out...
text: And 18 TERRIFIED GUYS stare at the JUMP-LIGHTS over the door.
text: We can't see any other planes in our V, but we can hear them
text: taking hits. The C-47 bounces violently, creaking in protest.
text: Then another sound - like rocks shaken inside a tin can:
dialog: 12.
text: It's 40 mm. fire from below - BLUE, GREEN, and RED TRACERS
text: lighting up the sky. Lethal whizzing sounds, everywhere.
text: Then 88mm. SHELLS start exploding. BAH-BOOM. Death itself.
text: Each explosion concussive, jolting us: BAH-BOOM. BAH-BOOM.
dialog: No one on this plane believes we're going to survive. Ford
text: can see that in the tense faces, the white knuckles. So he
dialog: does what leaders do - raising his voice, and:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Guys, tell me something. On the
dialog: level. 'Cause I don't know if I'm
dialog: gonna get another chance to ask.
text: Every head turns. He looks troubled, serious... until:
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: his front parachute)
dialog: Does this make me look fat?
text: LAUGHTER erupts, big-time. Tension broken, just like that.
text: Boyce eyes Ford with awe. Then:
text: --suddenly, TAT-TAT-TAT: Bullets from the machine-guns on the
dialog: 
text: ground pierce our fuselage from below. PFC RIX (holding a
text: FLAMETHROWER) is hit in the rump; he falls forward, howling.
dialog: 
text: .-.as the RED JUMP-LIGHT above the cargo door pops ON. And:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: On your feet! Stand up and hook up!
text: The men bounce up and hook the lines from their chutes to the
text: ANCHOR LINE running along the ceiling of the fuselage,
text: forming a line that stretches back from the cargo-bay door.
text: We hear them calling out, "Eighteen okay!" "Seventeen okay!"
text: "Sixteen okay!" ...as MORE FLAK explodes, knocking guys over.
text: Ford keeps Boyce from falling as they approach the jump-line.
text: Then a HUGE BURST knocks us sideways. Ford falls forward. A
text: SECOND BURST hits our RIGHT-WING ENGINE; it DIES, belching
text: smoke. The C-47 lurches violently to the right.
dialog: 
text: More FLAK. More 40 mm. fire from below. Metal whizzing around
dialog: us. It's like a Goddamn shooting gallery in here--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You hit?!
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: No!
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Get to the line!
text: Boyce hooks himself to the ANCHOR-LINE, fifth from the door.
text: Above it, that JUMP-LIGHT remains RED, the sky now a curtain
text: of EXPLODING FLAK. Grieb, at the bay-door, stares, shaking.
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: In line! In line!
speaker_heading: GRIEB
dialog: Sarge, there's nowhere to jump!
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: In line! Every man! We jump on GREEN!
text: Everybody staring at that RED LIGHT, and the death out there.
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: (to Dawes)
dialog: Promise me, okay? If it looks like
dialog: I'm about to be captured, put a
dialog: bullet in my back.
speaker_heading: DAWES
dialog: Why would I do that?
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: I'd rather not find out how Nazis
dialog: treat prisoners named Rosenfeld.
speaker_heading: DAWES
dialog: You're assuming we're gonna survive
dialog: the jump.
text: But Rosenfeld's look says, "I'm not kidding." Dawes nods, a
text: solemn promise - as Ford hooks up to the Anchor Line.
scene_heading: INT. C-47 - COCKPIT - FLYING - RESUMING
text: We emerge from CLOUDS at 150 m.p.h., with the sky on FIRE.
text: McKean, struggling with one working engine, reaches for the
text: jump-light switch, the GREEN setting.
text: Then, a horrible THUMP, on McKean's left. He looks out the
text: window - and sees something that makes him blanch.
scene_heading: LT. MCKEAN
dialog: Good Christ...
scene_heading: INT. C-47 - FUSELAGE - FLYING - RESUMING
text: Jumpmaster Rensin and Grieb are now staring at the same thing
dialog: that McKean just saw... and it's awful:
dialog: 14.
text: THEIR POV: THE LEFT WING - now draped by a PARACHUTE.
text: .--Still attached to a PARATROOPER. Poor guy must've jumped
text: from a plane above us. Dead now, his body bucking in our prop-
text: wash, fouled by the lines of his chute. Horrible.
text: Grieb gags. Boyce, fifth in line from the door, just stares,
text: horrified. But Rensin gathers himself, faces his men, and:
speaker_heading: JUMPMASTER RENSIN
dialog: When you hit the ground, use your
dialog: crickets to find the rest of your
dialog: stick! Checkwords: "flash,"
dialog: "thunder," "welcome." Anybody doesn't
dialog: answer back, you FIRE! We're gonna be
dialog: SOUTH of our target! Use your maps
dialog: and compass - but get to that church
dialog: and take out that Goddamn TOWER! It--
text: Then he's GONE - EVISCERATED mid-word by EXPLODING FLAK.
dialog: 
text: A HUGE BOOM RIGHT OUTSIDE THE CARGO DOOR - blowing a hole in
text: our flank and taking Rensin and Grieb with it.
text: Boyce's eyes go wide. There's no red light to watch anymore;
text: the Cargo Door is now a gaping HOLE. Everyone shocked. And--
text: ANOTHER HIT - our LEFT ENGINE NOW - it sputters, dying.
text: And WE START TO DIVE. Sinking like a safe... Ford acts
text: quickly, unhooking himself from the JUMP-LINE and:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Everybody out! GO GO GO!
text: He pushes guys out the door: Dawes, Tibbet, Rosenfeld, Chase;
text: this is pure unrehearsed bravery. Grunauer, up next, stumbles
text: to the floor. Ford rolls him out the door.
text: Next up is Boyce - he hesitates, petrified.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Go! Go!
text: Boyce goes... but first he grabs Ford and pulls him out too--
text: They fall into the night; a BLAST of air smacks them, yanking
text: Boyce's CHUTE open. The jolt rips Ford from Boyce's grasp as:
text: A HUGE EXPLOSION ABOVE US. Our C-47 just disintegrated. Boyce
text: is suddenly alone, mid-air. Death everywhere. PIECES OF THEIR
text: PLANE now falling beside him - burning metal. A disaster...
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - FALLING - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: Boyce's eyes dart, trying to orient himself. Looking for Ford
text: or other chutes as he plummets amid smoke, noise, terror..
text: Exploding FLAK, BULLETS whistling by, a WALL of tracer fire
text: to his left. Where is Ford's Goddamn chute?
text: The fuzzy outline of LAND below. It crystallizes as it rushes
text: up to meet us. Boyce braces himself for a THUD.
text: Instead, a so SPLASH. And he VANISHES, just like that, in:
scene_heading: EXT. MERDERET RIVER - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: WATER. He has fallen into a RIVER. It swallows him whole.
scene_heading: INT. UNDER WATER - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: He opens his eyes, shocked. Loaded with gear, fouled by his
dialog: lines. I'm going to drown. Holy Hell. I need air!
text: He feels for the river bed beneath his feet. There it is. He
text: coils his legs, springs up. Above him is the surface.
text: His head breaches for half a second, under his CHUTE. He
text: gulps in a breath, then sinks like a stone again.
text: Under water, he reaches for his TRENCH KNIFE. Grabs it--
text: And fumbles it. Shit! It sinks, fast. He drops down after it,
text: hits bottom, searching and fumbling amidst RIVER SILT. No
text: light down here at all - grasping urgently, blindly.
text: .--but he finds it, holds on tight, pushes himself up again.
text: ..-another stolen GASP of air. Then down again. He starts
text: sawing away at the straps of his CHUTE-HARNESS.
text: He cuts through one, then the other, cuts his MUSETTE BAG
text: loose, drops his mines, and - buoyant now - bounces up again.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK —- CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: His head clears the surface, then his chest. He drags himself
text: onto the RIVERBANK. Drenched, gasping.
text: --doesn't see anyone. But he can hear GUNFIRE in the woods.
text: Overhead he sees C-47's, most of them laboring, some of them
text: smoking. Parachutes in the distance. He gets to his feet.
text: JUMP-CUTS: He assembles his RIFLE. Checks his ammo, grenades,
text: COMPASS (north, go north). Then he rises - and moves toward:
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: EXT. SOGGY PASTURE - MOVING - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: He stays low - wet grass underfoot, gunfire in the distance.
text: From his pants he extracts that DIME-STORE METAL CRICKET. He
text: chirps it twice. CLICK-CLACK. CLICK-CLACK. No one replies.
text: Up ahead, he sees a billow of WHITE against the dull earth:
text: Another chute. Please be Lew. He heads toward it while
text: chirping that CRICKET again. No reply. Two more tries. Again
text: nothing. His hands squeeze his rifle tighter.
text: He gets to the chute; there's a SHAPE under it. A body? He
text: pulls the chute away. A PARATROOPER lies here, FACE DOWN.
text: Boyce braces himself, turns the body over...
text: It's Dawes - eyes closed. Boyce shakes him:
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Dawes. Dawes! You okay?
text: Dawes' eyes open. Disoriented - but instantly on mission:
speaker_heading: DAWES
dialog: Where's Rosenfeld? You got him?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: No. Are you hurt?
speaker_heading: DAWES
text: No. Head's ringing a little.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Let's go. We gotta find everybody.
text: They move north, slowly, along the wet grass, chirping their
text: metal CRICKETS. In the night we hear REPEATED BURSTS of
text: GUNFIRE, mini-battles flaring up all through the woods.
text: ...-staying low, everything tensed, clicking their CRICKETS.
text: Then they hear ANOTHER CRICKET chirp back. They pause.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT’D)
dialog: Flash.
speaker_heading: UNSEEN G.I. (TIBBET)
dialog: Thunder.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Welcome.
text: Tibbet emerges from behind a tree, relieved to see them.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tibbet. Ya see anybody else?
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: No. How many of us made it out?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Christ. Did Gurkin make it? He had
dialog: the explosives.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I don't know. Didn't see him.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Where's Ford? Thought you two were
text: joined at the hip.
speaker_heading: DAWES
dialog: Don't be an asshole, Tibbet.
text: More GUNFIRE in the distance. ABOVE US A STRICKEN C-47
text: SUDDENLY FALLS FROM THE SKY, on fire - right at us.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Hit it!
text: Boyce, Dawes, and Tibbet hit the dirt, covering their heads.
text: The FLAMING C-47 crashes behind them, EXPLODING on impact.
dialog: There's nothing left of it. Good God. But it throws enough
text: FIRELIGHT to show us a PARACHUTE stuck in a NEARBY TREE that
text: stands along a country lane, ROAD 13.
text: The guys get to their feet and head for that tree. GUNFIRE
text: echoes in the DISTANCE. They cross over Road 13, to:
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD 13 - TREE - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: They look up at the PARACHUTE stuck in its upper branches -
text: and a pair of LEGS dangling. Boyce whispers loudly:
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Flash.
speaker_heading: FORD (0.S.)
dialog: Thunder!
text: Wait. That's Ford's voice. They look up:
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Lew!
dialog: 18.
text: Yep. It's Ford, stuck in this tree, 20 feet up, his left arm
text: pinned at an odd angle by all his gear. He can't move it.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Ed. Jesus. Can someone get me down?
text: My arm's pinned.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: (starts climbing)
dialog: Yeah. Just hang on.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Did the detonator get banged up?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: It's fine. I'm fine too, by the way.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Make it fast - awright, Boyce?
text: Boyce climbs, his head on a swivel - feels awfully VISIBLE,
dialog: but that's his buddy up there... More GUNFIRE in the night.
text: Boyce keeps climbing. He's 15 feet off the ground, when:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Ed!
text: Boyce turns - and it happens in a flash:
text: TWO WEHRMACHT SOLDIERS appear from the road.
dialog: 
text: Boyce, clinging to that tree, grabs at his RIFLE. It falls.
text: ++.-JjJust as the Germans start firing. But--
text: Ford, suspended 20 FEET in the air, draws his SIDEARM with
text: his right hand and FIRES - TWO SHOTS.
text: And the Germans FALL, both of them. Just like that. Dead.
text: Boyce doesn't move at first. It still feels unreal... Then:
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Aw Christ...
text: Boyce looks down. Dawes is dead. HEAD-SHOT. Tibbet stands
text: beside the body - unharmed but badly shaken.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay, Tibbet?
dialog: (Tibbet half-nods)
dialog: Ed, get up here and cut me loose
dialog: before anybody else drops by. Gotta
dialog: take that tower out.
dialog: 19.
text: Boyce starts climbing again, so disappointed in himself.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF THE TREE - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: Boyce arrives at the top, Ford calm and ever-vigilant.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Good shooting.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Dumb luck. Get me outta here.
text: Boyce takes out his KNIFE, saws at the chute lines.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I couldn't get to my rifle. Ya got a
dialog: grip on that branch?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: ‘Kay. Here goes.
text: Boyce cuts another line, freeing Ford... But Ford didn't have
text: a good grip on the branch - and he falls, straight down.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lew!
text: Boyce catches him, Ford slamming into the TREE. The IMPACT
text: causes something to shake from his belt - that DETONATOR.
text: It's dense metal, canteen-sized, falling like an anvil toward
text: Tibbet who is kneeling over Dawes to remove Dawes' dog-tag.
speaker_heading: FORD/BOYCE
dialog: Heads up!
text: Tibbet moves just in time, the detonator lands beside him.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Goddammit!
text: Boyce and Ford trade a look - two G.I.'s, hanging on - in the
text: middle of the forest in the middle of the night in the middle
text: of a war. Ford calmly reaches for the tree-trunk.
text: ..-and shimmies down. Boyce follows, speechless as ever at
text: Ford's unflappable calm. They reach the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD 13 - TREE - RESUMING (NIGHT)
text: Dawes lies at their feet. 20 feet away lie the two Germans.
dialog: 20.
text: The air above crackles with tracer fire, flak, dying C-47's.
text: Ford eyes that DETONATOR, puts it back on his belt.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Good as new.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Almost took my damn head off.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Yeah, that woulda been a shame.
text: Tibbet doesn't reply. Ford takes Dawes' GRENADES and AMMO and
text: unfolds his SILK MAP again.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Like to know where the hell we are.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Sarge said we were south of the--
text: Suddenly, Boyce FREEZES - MORE FOOTSTEPS COMING. Fainter.
text: Lighter. Just one person now. But he's coming right this way.
text: Ford, Boyce, and Tibbet hit the dirt - keeping their heads up
text: and rifles ready. Silent...
text: Waiting... The FOOTSTEPS getting closer... Closer... Hands
text: push some branches aside - 20 feet from here... revealing:
text: A girl of 19, coming from the road. This is CHLOE LAURENT.
text: She's French, lovely, but hardened by war and loss - terror
text: too. The G.I.'s stay low, invisible to her, as:
text: She stops beside a nearby TREE, where we now see an ANIMAL
text: TRAP, a dead SQUIRREL inside. Chloe opens the trap - it's
text: heavy, rusty, but she's strong.
text: She puts the squirrel carcass in a satchel, resets the trap.
text: Then she spots the DEAD GERMANS, and moves toward them...
text: With our guys watching, she starts rifling through their
dialog: pockets. That fast she's taken pistols, ammo, gloves,
text: scarves, rings, mess-kits. Chloe's a scavenger.
text: Ford and Boyce silently eye one another...
text: Then Chloe FREEZES - just heard something. She turns.
text: ...to find THREE RIFLES pointing at her. Her hands go up.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Allemagne?
speaker_heading: CHLOE (FRENCH, SUBTITLED)
dialog: Non! Non! Je suis--
dialog: The G.I.'s get to their feet. They're American. That changes
text: everything. She exclaims, in accented ENGLISH:
speaker_heading: CHLOE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're here! My God!
text: That fast she starts sobbing, hard, as if she'd been freed
text: from Dachau. She rushes over to hug them. Ford steps back...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Where are we?
dialog: (Chloe keeps sobbing)
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: (thru tears)
text: Outside Cielblanc.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Is this Road Thirteen?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Where's the coast?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Three kilometers, that way.
text: Ford and Boyce brush past her, moving some foliage aside: the
text: town of Cielblanc is a tiny dot, nearly a mile from here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: You seen any other G.I.'s out here?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: (so hopeful)
dialog: This was your target? Cielblanc? You
dialog: liberate us?
text: They don't answer. Overhead, more planes groan.
text: Then Ford stiffens. Just heard something else:
text: A VEHICLE, approaching. Ford and Boyce know that sound.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: German half-track. Shit...
text: A HALF-TRACK, and it's getting closer, lurching up Road 13.
text: They reach for their GRENADES, looking for somewhere to hide--
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: No. Play dead.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Like Hell we will.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Please, listen to me. If they get you
dialog: we'll never be free of them.
text: Ford whips around, looking for a hiding spot.
dialog: Then he stops. Truth is there's no better option out here -
dialog: and he knows it. So, although he HATES this plan...
text: He leans back. Boyce and Tibbet too, their eyes SHUT. Ford
text: turns his back to the road - his eyes OPEN - positioning his
text: TRENCH-KNIFE like a mirror so he can see the road, as:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (whispered, bitter)
dialog: "What'd you do in the war, Grandpa?"
text: Boyce eyes him: "Sssshhh." Ford goes stone-still.
text: The HALF-TRACK pulls toward us - a truck with TANK TREADS in
text: back, WHEELS up front, mounted MACHINE-GUNS. And SIX GERMAN
text: SOLDIERS, scanning the ground for movement.
text: Chloe, playing her part, rifles through Dawes' pockets like
text: the scavenger she is. Her hands are shaking with fear.
text: Boyce lies still, his eyes cracking open enough to see Ford--
text: ..-who is watching Chloe while fingering the trigger on his
text: side-arm. Boyce eyes the DEAD SQUIRREL poking out of Chloe's
dialog: bag. A bad omen...
text: The Half-Track getting closer, when... DISASTER:
text: The HALF-TRACK STOPS. Right here. A SERGEANT hollers at Chloe
text: in German. She replies meekly. He shouts again, ordering her.
text: And Chloe rises... leaving the G.I. "bodies" behind - Ford,
text: Boyce, and Tibbet completely abandoned now...
dialog: 
text: The G.I.'s lie still. A LIGHT from the Half-Track sweeps the
text: ground around them. Boyce and Ford holding their breath...
dialog: 23.
text: Then the Half-Track passes. The G.I.'s wait a beat, then sit
text: up... which is when they see what's behind the Half-Track:
text: TWO AMERICAN POW's, hands over their heads. GERMAN SOLDIERS
text: trail behind them, rifles up. One POW we don't recognize.
dialog: 
text: The other is Rosenfeld. His face ashen.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Dammit!
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: They got Rosenfeld. Jeez.
text: Ford moves a branch, eager to start firing. But he can't.
text: Boyce eyes him. The POW's march TOWARD CIELBLANC.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Let's move out, on their tail.
text: Just about to move out. Then a SOUND. They turn, rifles up.
text: It's Chloe again. That tells Boyce something about her - but
text: Ford isn't yet convinced. They lower their rifles.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I'm sorry. They ordered me away.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Get back to your house and stay
dialog: inside. Anybody asks, you didn't see
dialog: any G.I.'s out here tonight, okay?
dialog: Let's move out.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I can help you.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: We're fine. Thanks.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD 13 - APPROACHING CIELBLANC - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
text: Ford, Boyce, and Tibbet trail the half-track at a distance.
text: Chloe lags behind the G.I.'s.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: What the hell's she doin' back there?
dialog: (no one answers)
dialog: Makin' me nervous...
text: Up ahead, the Germans on foot order the POW's to leave the
text: road, pushing them past a CRUMBLING WALL that marks the
text: entrance to CIELBLANC. Half-Track continues down the road.
dialog: 24.
text: As the G.I.'s get closer, we get our first look at the town:
text: 20 houses, a few barns, a well, a gallows...
text: And, on a FOOTHILL overlooking the town, a Gothic CHURCH...
text: It's BIG, rimmed by a tall GATE; a RADIO-JAMMING TOWER rises
text: from the church's roof. Stained glass, flying buttresses.
text: The G.I.'s trade looks. Behind them, Chloe checks ANOTHER
text: TRAP. This one empty. The G.I.'s hurry toward that crumbling
text: town-wall and take cover behind it...
scene_heading: EXT. CIELBLANC - AT THE CRUMBLING WALL - CONTINUING
text: From here they see Rosenfeld and the other POW marching up a
text: narrow road behind the town... and into that church on the
text: foothill. Then we lose sight of them.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: We get 'em outta there, then blow it
dialog: up as ordered.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Yeah? With what for ordnance - your
dialog: Zippo? Nobody knows where Gurkin is.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Then I guess we better FIND him, huh.
dialog: 
text: That shut Tibbet up. The moment hangs... as Chloe arrives.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: What can you tell me about that
dialog: church?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Is that why you're here? The church?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Just tell me what's in there. How
dialog: many soldiers?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Sometimes just a few. Sometimes more.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Any civilians in there? Clergy?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: There was a priest; the Nazis hung
dialog: him. You have more men coming?
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Listen, Sister. Au_revoir. Okay?
dialog: 25.
text: That stung her. Ford glares at Tibbet: I'll do the talking.
text: Again, Tibbet backs down.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Chloe Laurent. I live with my family,
dialog: that house there. I can hide you
dialog: until the rest of your men arrive. We
dialog: have an attic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Thanks. But we didn't come here to
dialog: hide. G'night.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Then please, be careful for the other
dialog: houses. There are collaborators here.
dialog: (Boyce eyes Ford)
dialog: It's the Nazis - they have poisoned
dialog: this place... Good luck.
text: Ford nods. Chloe rises, heads home. The G.I.'s watch her go.
text: ..-until she has slipped quietly into her HOME. It has an
text: ATTIC WINDOW that overlooks the town. Ford notes it.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: How ya enjoying France so far?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: If she's France, I like France.
dialog: (Ford shakes his head)
dialog: You don't think she's pretty?
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Sure. So's Eva Braun.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Let's move out. You two go find
dialog: Gurkin; if he's dead, grab the
dialog: explosives. And round up anyone else
dialog: you can find. I'm gonna do a little
text: recon on the church.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Maybe we shouldn't split up.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Cover twice the ground this way, and
dialog: we still gotta knock that tower down.
dialog: Stick together; we'll rendezvous in
dialog: one hour, 4 a.m., right here. Okay?
text: They each click a button on their watches. Time to go.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep your head down.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: You too.
text: They part - Boyce and Tibbet heading North - towards forest.
text: Ford watches them go, covering them... then:
scene_heading: EXT. CIELBLANC - TOWN SQUARE - MOVING - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: Ford begins a slow, quiet advance through the square...
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE CIELBLANC - SAME (NIGHT)
text: Boyce and Tibbet move through PASTURE, looking for help while
text: trying to be invisible. GUNS in the distance...
scene_heading: EXT. CIELBLANC - TOWN SQUARE - RESUMING (NIGHT)
text: Ford passes the well and the gallows - quietly, any noise
dialog: could kill him. Passing a HOUSE, when--
text: DISASTER: its BEDROOM WINDOW OPENS. Ten feet from us. Ford
text: dives behind the nearest wall, as:
dialog: 
text: A WOMAN - EVY LESNER - leans out her window, scanning the
text: Square like a watchtower guard. She's a hard, war-ravaged 40.
dialog: But there's something wrong with her face--
text: The skin on half of it is BLISTERED and COAL-BLACK, the flesh
text: diseased, hanging limply. Her left eye is milky white. What
dialog: the hell happened to this lady? Typhus maybe?
text: Ford has no idea; he just stares from the shadows.
text: Finally, Lesner shuts the window. Ford, shaken, moves on...
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE CIELBLANC - FOREST - SAME (NIGHT)
text: Boyce and Tibbet stay low - the town at their back. We hear
text: odd ANIMAL CRIES in the night, distant FIREFIGHTS. The whole
text: forest feels alive around us, creepy as hell.
text: Boyce pulls out his METAL CRICKET. CLICK-CLACK, CLICK-CLACK.
dialog: 27.
text: Tibbet does it too. Nothing. They keep moving, searching...
text: Then, up ahead, SMOKE and METAL become visible--
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Boyce!
text: It's a downed C-47, a DEBRIS FIELD of twisted metal, rubber,
text: and glass. They wade in...
text: Then Boyce sees it, at his feet - a piece of TIN FLOORING,
text: used to be part of the FUSELAGE. It has words written on it:
dialog: "82nd Airborne. We came to liberate France. June 5, 1944."
text: Good God. Their plane, in sections now. Sobering as hell,
text: scary too. They start clicking their CRICKETS again - through
text: the smoking pieces of a dead plane.
text: Boyce finds its NOSE dug into dirt. "My Gal--" the rest of
text: the name buried. He keeps moving, until:
text: An ANIMAL SOUND startles him - growling, snorting. Boyce
text: edges around the crippled nose of the C-47 to find:
text: ...a WOLF, chewing the forearm of our dead pilot, McKean.
text: Boyce hisses at the wolf. It backs off grudgingly, nearing
text: another one of those ANIMAL TRAPS. Boyce hisses again.
text: The wolf changes course, narrowly side-stepping the trap.
text: Boyce turns back toward the fuselage...
text: But SOMETHING GRABS HIS ANKLE. He turns, terrified--
text: At his feet is Gurkin, who lies stiff - a PROPELLER BLADE
text: poking through his chest. Literally. But he's alive.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Gurkin! Tibbet, get over here!
text: Tibbet heads over. Boyce kneels beside Gurkin. The situation
text: is hopeless, obviously - Gurkin's practically been torn in
text: half - Boyce completely overwhelmed, but trying:
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: You just hang on, Gurkin. We're gonna
dialog: get you to a Medic...
text: Tibbet arrives. Boyce shakily pulls out a CANTEEN.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here. Take a sip...
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Gurkin, ya got the explosives?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Tibbet, give him a second.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Ya got ‘em, Gurkin?
text: Gurkin nods. Tibbet reaches into Gurkin's trouser pockets -
text: BLOOD SPURTING from Gurkin's chest onto Boyce's hands - as
text: Tibbet extracts FOUR TETRYTOL BLOCKS (they look like C-4).
dialog: 
text: Tibbet pockets them; Boyce just trying to compose himself.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Here, Buddy. Take a sip.
text: Gurkin waves away the water, reaching for something else:
text: Boyce's side-arm; Gurkin wants to be put out of his misery.
dialog: 
text: Boyce halts. Gurkin looks to him, begging, barely audible:
speaker_heading: GURKIN
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Listen, we're gonna get the medic--
text: Gurkin whispers it again. "Please." The guy is in agony.
text: Boyce eyes him, "Really?" Gurkin half-nods, pained...
text: Boyce looks to Tibbet, who dodges it with:
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: I'm gonna find Grunauer.
text: And Tibbet backs away - leaving just Boyce and Gurkin.
text: Gurkin's eyes are pleading. Boyce pulls out his sidearm, his
text: hand shaking... aims the weapon at Gurkin's head.
text: But he can't do it. No way. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I...
text: And Gurkin stops breathing. Dead. Eyes open. Boyce sags...
text: then breathes out a "Sorry", shuts Gurkin's eyes, and takes
text: one of Gurkin's Dog-Tags.
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE LESNER BARN - NIGHT
text: Ford passes by a BARN beside Lesner's home, then heads up the
text: Foothill, noting the GUARDS at the front gate of the church.
text: They're SS, black uniforms and all. That gets his attention.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - RESUMING (NIGHT)
text: Boyce follows Tibbet toward a dark stretch of woods. CLICK-
text: CLACK, CLICK-CLACK. No reply. Boyce tries again... This time,
text: we hear _a CHIRP IN REPLY. Maybe 50 yards away.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Tibbet.
text: They turn. The sound came from the foothill below the church.
text: They head over, staying low to the ground. We TRACK THEM...
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS/NEAR THE FOOTHILL - CONTINUING
text: Boyce and Tibbet get to a patch of trees, and:
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Flash.
scene_heading: PFC. CHASE/PFC. PENNER
dialog: Thunder.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Welcome.
text: Chase, from our stick, emerges from behind a tree. Beside him
dialog: is another paratrooper - PFC. PENNER. (Penner is new to us;
text: he's got a FLAMETHROWER strapped to his back.)
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE
dialog: You see anybody else?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
text: Just Ford. He's up the hill.
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE
dialog: This is Penner, five-oh-eighth, B-
text: Company. Lost his whole stick.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: What was your target, Penner?
speaker_heading: PFC. PENNER
text: Radio-jammer on top of the church.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Ours too. But they got two captured
text: G.I.'s inside.
dialog: 30.
text: Shit. They study the CHURCH from here - vast, Gothic.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: What else they got in there,
dialog: vampires? Places give me the creeps.
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE
dialog: Let's move out.
text: Just then, a NOISE - a RUMBLING SOUND coming this way.
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold it.
text: They HALT, and turn: it's a WEHRMACHT TRUCK, crossing
text: pastureland, its HEADLIGHTS just about to hit us.
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hit the dirt!
text: Down they go, ready for a firefight. Here comes the TRUCK.
text: But it TURNS RIGHT, toward the FOOTHILL. They watch it go. It
text: bounces over a bump, KER-CHUNK, an item nearly falling out of
text: the back of the truck:
text: A DEAD BODY. A fallen German soldier.
dialog: 
text: This truck, they now see, carries DOZENS OF THEM
text: Huh? The G.I.'s eye one another. The truck keeps going.
text: Oddly, about 50 yards from here it begins to DESCEND, as if
text: it'd just turned down a slope, or a ramp.
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE (CONT'D)
dialog: On me. Let's go.
text: Hugging the tree-line, they follow the truck. Boyce notes the
text: back of Penner's flamethrower. It says "Hitler Hunter."
scene_heading: EXT. CIELBLANC - FOOTHILL/CHURCH GATE - SAME (NIGHT)
text: Ford reaches the top of the FOOTHILL on the SOUTH SIDE of the
text: CHURCH. The RADIO-JAMMING TOWER looms above it.
text: That GATE, 12 feet high, surrounds the grounds. Ford finds a
text: nearby BRANCH... uses it to climb the gate... gets to the top
text: of the gate, scans the grounds:
text: At the FRONT GATE, those two SS GUARDS (PVT. KIEBEL and PVT.
text: WAFNER) eye the skies anxiously. All those planes. Then the
text: church's FRONT DOOR OPENS - a DOCTOR in a LABCOAT emerges:
dialog: 31.
text: DR. HUGO BRUEL, the man we saw in that 16 mm. FILM. He's 50,
text: passionate about Nazism, a taskmaster... But Wafner and
text: Kiebel fail to come to attention; that tells Ford something.
text: Bruel has an odd tic, a neck-twitch that often snaps his head
text: to the left by an inch. It infuriates him, always has. He
text: yells at Wafner and Kiebel, gesturing to the PLANES overhead.
text: They answer mechanically, "Nein, Herr Doktor." and "Jawohl,
text: Herr Doktor." Bruel tics again and storms back inside.
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTHILL - NORTH SIDE/EARTHEN RAMP - MOMENTS LATER
text: Boyce, Tibbet, Chase, and Penner reach the spot where the
text: truck descended, and they STOP - just saw something odd:
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE
dialog: What the???
text: A WIDE RAMP has been BULLDOZED into the EARTH out here, like
text: a driveway descending into an unseen garage, directly beneath
text: the church. It's guarded by heavy BLAST-DOORS.
text: ANCIENT STONES decorate the "overpass" above the ramp. On the
text: stones are RUNIC SYMBOLS, (ancient letters). A large SWASTIKA
text: has been added dead center, flanked by two SS INSIGNIAS.
text: The truck awaits entry. Then the BLAST-DOORS open... and the
text: truck's HEADLIGHTS show us where this ramp leads: darkness, a
text: CAVERN. But we don't see any GUARDS - nothing moving.
text: The truck rolls down the ramp. The blast-doors remain open. A
dialog: beat. Chase thinking...
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Why would they be bringing dead
dialog: bodies in there?
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE
dialog: I don't know - but I wanna take a
dialog: look.
dialog: (no one volunteers)
dialog: Might be our best shot at getting
text: inside the church.
text: Sounds like a horrible idea to Boyce, but he's silent.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: You wanna be a hero, be my guest.
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE
dialog: You and Penner come with me. Boyce,
dialog: you stay up top and cover our backs.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Hey! Why me?
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE
dialog: Why not you? Let's go.
text: Tibbet doesn't like it, but he follows Chase and Penner down
text: the earthen ramp - just DARKNESS at the bottom of it. What
text: the hell is down there? Boyce stands watch, 20 feet back.
text: ..-until Chase, Tibbet, and Penner enter the DARKNESS at the
text: bottom of the ramp, gone from our view now. Boyce STOPS.
text: SILENCE. Boyce spots something shiny at his feet.
text: It's a DAGGER, decorated by a DEATH'S-HEAD and runic symbols
text: and a SWASTIKA. And the letters SS. Boyce examines it. Why
text: would the SS be out here? He pockets it. Then, suddenly--
text: RIFLE FIRE from the darkness of the cavern. Lots of it. Boyce
text: drops to a knee - rifle slung, heart pounding. MORE RIFLE
dialog: FIRE. He's all alone on this ramp...
text: MORE SHOTS. He rises, takes a step down the ramp, when--
text: FLAMES pierce the darkness at the bottom of the ramp - we
text: can't see their source - followed by a SCREAM from Penner -
text: then MORE SHOTS, ANOTHER SCREAM - then Chase yelling:
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: GO GO Go!
text: Boyce staring at those FLAMES in the DARKNESS - as:
text: Chase and Tibbet race back up the ramp bearing their rifles -
text: running for their lives, terrified. They sprint up the ramp,
dialog: right past Boyce - it's all a BLUR:
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Chase, what was--
speaker_heading: PFC. CHASE
dialog: Run! Run!
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Where's Penner? Is he hit?
text: They keep running. Chase hits the top of the ramp, into
text: PASTURE. Tibbet right behind him. Boyce looks back - sees the
text: reflection of FLAMES on a cavern wall. Then, behind him--
text: --at the edge of the pasture - BOOM - an EXPLOSION. Chase
text: just hit a LANDMINE. We see pieces of him rain down.
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
text: ...-followed by a confused SILENCE. Boyce stunned. Then:
text: A KLAXON SOUNDS, loud. A RED EMERGENCY LIGHT starts swirling
text: in the darkness at the bottom of the ramp. Boyce's position
text: completely exposed. He takes off up the ramp.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH GATE - RESUMING
text: Ford watches as the GUARDS out here react to the KLAXON. One
text: races for a SEARCHLIGHT at the front gate. Then:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTHILL - EARTHEN RAMP/PASTURE - RESUMING
text: That SEARCHLIGHT BEAM slaps on, emanating from the CHURCH--
text: A shitstorm. Boyce running for cover. At the edge of the
text: PASTURE he sees Tibbet, frozen in fear - a few feet from
text: where Chase exploded. Boyce grabs Tibbet.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Landmines...
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: We gotta move, Tibbet!
text: Adrenaline pumping, Boyce pulls Tibbet behind a TREE - the
text: SEARCHLIGHT BEAM just missing them. It lands on the body of
text: Chase in the pasture. We hear GERMAN SOLDIERS, SHOUTING.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH GATE - RESUMING
text: Klaxon howling. Ford sees THREE SS GUARDS race out the front
text: church gate, heading toward that RAMP on the hill.
text: Now he's got an opening. He rolls off the gate, onto:
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH GROUNDS - CONTINUING
text: 12 FEET STRAIGHT DOWN. He lands, crosses the church grounds -
text: to the building itself. Then he hears:
text: A MAN'S SCREAM - sounds like TORTURE - coming from inside the
text: church. Boyce hurries over, crouched, but can't see the
text: source of the screams. Just heard another one. Shit.
text: Then Ford hears SHOUTING in GERMAN - a voice coming this way:
text: SS CAPTAIN LOTHAR MUELLER, 25, bursting out of the FRONT DOOR
text: of the church, about to turn in this direction.
dialog: Fuck. Ford has to get out of here. Now. He turns--
text: ..-hurries to the BACK GATE, pulls himself up - and over:
dialog: 34.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND THE CHURCH GROUNDS - RIDGELINE - CONTINUING
text: He lands hard. Another scream from the church fills the
text: night. Ford starts to slink around the back of the church.
scene_heading: EXT. OVERLOOKING THE EARTHEN RAMP - RESUMING
text: KLAXON wailing. Boyce and Tibbet crouching low. From here
text: they can see one of those SS GUARDS (PRIVATE RICHT) eyeing
text: the remains of Chase in that field.
text: The OTHER TWO SS GUARDS are in the cavern at the bottom of
text: the RAMP. We hear a FIRE-HOSE, extinguishing the fire.
text: Then... silence. The Klaxon is shut off. Only the searchlight
text: remains. Pvt. Richt heads down the ramp.
text: ...leaving Boyce and a very shaken Tibbet:
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: What the hell happened down there?
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: I don't know. I don't know! An SS
dialog: guy, we put ten shots into him - he
dialog: musta had body-armor on; guy just
dialog: kept coming! He tore Penner apart!
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: I don't know! Chase gave the order to
dialog: get outta there, I wasn't gonna
dialog: argue.
text: At the bottom of the ramp, the BLAST-DOORS close. Christ...
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Let's go find Lew...
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE CHURCH GATE - RESUMING (NIGHT)
text: Ford heads down the foothill, careful not to make a sound.
text: Then a horrible SNAP - the slamming shut of metal on metal.
text: He just stepped on one of Chloe's ANIMAL TRAPS. His ANKLE
text: SHATTERED, that fast. Blinding pain.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE CIELBLANC/ROAD 13 - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Boyce and Tibbet reach the rendezvous site, that CRUMBLING
text: WALL. The SEARCHLIGHT BEAM sweeps and scans. And there's no
text: sign of Ford. Tibbet, shaken, masks it with rancor:
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: 4:10. Where's your buddy?
dialog: Boyce doesn't know. He wishes he did...
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTHILL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Ford sits up, perspiring with pain. He grabs that TRAP, opens
text: it, extricates his leg from it, the foot hanging limply.
text: Fuck. He starts CRAWLING down the foothill now...
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE CIELBLANC/ROAD 13 - LATER NIGHT
text: Still no Ford. Boyce eyes his watch again, anxiously... and:
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: He's in trouble. Let's go.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: Orders were to stay here, remember?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
text: Not if he's a half-hour late.
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: I got the ordnance. Guys carrying
dialog: ordnance stay put.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Where'd ya read THAT?
speaker_heading: TIBBET
dialog: You wanna risk your neck go ahead. I
dialog: don't like the guy enough to get
dialog: killed for him.
text: Tibbet's not moving. Boyce backs away.
scene_heading: EXT. CIELBLANC - BEHIND A SILO - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Boyce looks behind a SILO. No Ford. Panic building. The
text: SEARCHLIGHT sweeps past. Boyce moves on...
scene_heading: EXT. CIELBLANC - BEHIND AN UNNAMED HOME - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Boyce is walking, searching... Then he STOPS - just saw
text: something at his feet that takes his breath away:
text: The body of a DOG - bloody, dead... and HEADLESS.
text: Just lying there on the ground, a headless canine. Good God.
text: Who the hell would do that? And why? He's at a loss... until:
text: MOTORCYCLE SOUNDS - startling him - followed by VOICES:
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: UNSEEN GERMAN VOICES (0.S.)
dialog: Hande hoch! Hande hoch!
text: Boyce instinctively puts his hands up... then turns - to see:
text: HIS POV: the crumbling wall, where Tibbet is - SIX GERMAN
text: SOLDIERS appear across the road, weapons aimed right at him.
dialog: 
text: Boyce crouches down, his eyes peeled.
text: The wall itself obscures our view - but Boyce can see those
text: six Germans approach Tibbet... and his HANDS as they go up.
text: ONE GERMAN takes Tibbet's rifle. Another offers him a smoke.
text: A THIRD ONE FIRES AT HIM, POINT-BLANK. Goodbye, Tibbet.
text: Boyce recoils, accidentally stumbling over the HEADLESS DOG,
text: almost falling. That makes a noise. He FREEZES.
text: The six Germans don't turn; they're too busy - throwing
text: TIBBET'S BODY on the SIDECAR of a Zundapp motorcycle. One
text: SOLDIER starts it up, noisily. Tibbet's body draped limply.
text: Just like that, the motorcycle blows through the Square and
text: up the narrow road - passing right by Boyce...
text: -..and onto the CHURCH GROUNDS. Gates close behind it.
text: Boyce is aghast, confused... and completely alone.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE OF THE FOOTHILL - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)
text: Boyce hides against a tree, trying to calm himself... It's
text: impossible; the night's just too scary until, a whisper:
speaker_heading: FORD (0.S.)
dialog: Ed!
text: Wait. That was Ford. Boyce sees a shape against the soil,
text: crawling. And there he is, Ford. Thank God...
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Lew.
text: Huge relief. Boyce hurries over... But here comes the
text: SEARCHLIGHT, ruining the reunion. Boyce and Ford duck behind
text: a WIDE TREE. The Searchlight passes.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Was that Tibbet? I told you guys to
dialog: stick together.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I thought you might be in trouble.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Doesn't matter, Ed. It was an order.
text: Boyce tightens, his eyes flitting to the CORPORAL CHEVRON on
text: Ford's uniform. Then he notices Ford's ankle.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: What happened to your leg?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Ankle's busted. Ya find our stick?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Just Chase and a guy from Bravo
dialog: Company; nobody else. Can you walk?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: No. Where are they?
text: Boyce now has to factor in the idea of Ford being hobbled.
dialog: It's unsettling as hell--
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: They went down a RAMP under the
dialog: church. I don't know what happened
dialog: down there, but the guy from Bravo
dialog: never made it out, and Chase ran over
text: a landmine trying to get away. Tibbet
dialog: said there was a Jerry down there
dialog: with some kinda body armor.
text: Ford digests that, trying to come up with a plan--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Okay. You gotta go round up the rest
text: of the stick. Maybe closer to the
dialog: road. I'll find someplace to hide
dialog: 'til you're back.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Like Hell you will. There're Jerries
dialog: all over the place. SS--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I can hide in a barn or something.
dialog: I'll be fine. We only got four hours
dialog: to take out the target, Ed.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I'm not leaving you out here with a
text: busted leg.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Well ya sure as hell can't bring me,
dialog: and we need the rest of our stick.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Lew, we are the rest of our stick!
dialog: (that lands)
dialog: Listen to me. There's something wrong
text: down there. A truck went in, carrying
dialog: dead_bodies. Why would they be doing
dialog: that? Blast-doors, mines-—-
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Sarge told us the place would be
dialog: heavily-defended. So what? They're
dialog: torturing our guys in there--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I'm not leaving you--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I_don't matter right now, ya got
dialog: that? Just the mission! Now go find
dialog: us some Goddamn help!
text: Boyce tightens again, hurt. The SEARCHLIGHT BEAM sweeps past
text: again. That ZUNDAPP MOTORCYCLE, minus Tibbet now, leaves the
text: church and heads for Road 13 again. Boyce watching...
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Well, I'm not leaving you down. You
dialog: wanna take my stripe, take it.
text: Ford exhales, his face working... needs a plan... Then:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Okay. We'll do it ourselves.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You up on the hill behind the church.
dialog: Me, somewhere with a flat trajectory
dialog: over those front gates. Something to
text: smoke 'em out of the building, and
dialog: it's a turkey shoot.
text: Wait. What? Boyce is pretty sure he's kidding. Has to be.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Then we level the place, like we were
dialog: ordered to.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Lew, Tibbet had the explosives.
speaker_heading: FORD
text: Then they're inside the church now,
dialog: right? Just have to find them.
text: Boyce eyes the church. It looks big, imposing, impossible.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: The two of us.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: And you'll be firing from where?
text: Ford has an idea, we can tell. We SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND THE LAURENT HOME - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)
text: Ford and Boyce hide in shadow behind Chloe's house. Carrying
text: more pilfered goods, she crosses through a vegetable patch to
dialog: her BACK DOOR as--
text: Boyce and Ford emerge from the dark. Chloe jumps back, scared
text: - then catches her breath, realizing it's them.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: That attic of yours.
text: She's about to answer when she sees Ford's ankle. Oh.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
text: It's busted. He can't walk.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: One of your Goddamn traps. You mighta
dialog: warned us where you'd--
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Please - not so loud. We don't want
dialog: to wake my family.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Why? Are they collaborators too?
text: The SEARCHLIGHT BEAM blows by. They duck. Then it's gone.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: They're just afraid.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Yeah? How afraid?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You'd understand if you lived here.
text: Just then, A SOUND - the front gate of the CHURCH opening.
speaker_heading: FORD
text: Ed saw a ramp, leading under the
dialog: church. What're they doing in there?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: "Experiments." They built a lab under
dialog: the chapel. I'm sorry about your leg.
text: Ford reacts - a lab? - when they see Pvt. Kiebel descending
text: the foothill, armed, approaching the town. Shit. Without a
text: word, Boyce helps Ford toward the back door...
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - GROUND FLOOR - HALLWAY - CONTINUING
text: Chloe leads Ford and Boyce inside this simple country home -
text: the FLOORBOARDS in here creaking with every step. Agonizing.
text: That SEARCHLIGHT BEAM drills through a window. Ford and Boyce
text: duck into shadow - and they freeze there, Ford whispering:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What kind of "experiments"?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Science. Torture. Depends who you
dialog: ask. There's a doctor--
text: The beam moves on. Ford hobbles into:
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - GREAT ROOM - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: A dining table, five chairs, a DOOR leading up to an ATTIC...
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: He comes around every morning.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: We won't be here in the morning.
text: He starts up the ATTIC STEPS. Chloe hands Boyce an OIL LAMP.
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - ATTIC STAIRS - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: Ford hops up the steps, Boyce in tow, carrying that lamp.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: How ya doin', Lew?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Dandy.
text: The guy's in agony. They keep climbing, quietly, to:
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - ATTIC - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: Discards, trunks, a bench, a table, a tiny GLASSLESS WINDOW.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Help me to the window, would ya?
text: Boyce helps him over. Ford slides to the floor - looking down
text: at_Kiebel out there, patrolling the Town Square.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT’D)
dialog: Whaddaya guess that gate is from
dialog: here? Hundred-fifty yards?
text: Boyce looks out, to see a flat shooting trajectory from here
text: to the church grounds. Treeline behind it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Yeah. Are we gonna do something about
dialog: your ankle?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Sure, ya got an axe handy?
dialog: (Boyce gets the point)
text: There's a ridge in the treeline
dialog: behind the church - ya see it?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You're there. I'm here. On a signal
dialog: you toss two grenades at the church.
text: Boom-boom, Jerries come running out;
dialog: we get 'em in the crossfire.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: Nothin' to it.
text: Ford grins, keeping his eyes on Kiebel patrolling below -
text: Boyce's eyes moving to the well, the gallows, the church...
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm telling you, something's off.
dialog: This whole place feels weird.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: ‘Course it does! It's a town full of
dialog: French Nazis--
text: ...this said just as Chloe appears at the top of the steps -
text: bearing Iodine, cloth, and gauze.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Then maybe you could take us away
dialog: from here?
text: Behind her is her brother PAUL, 7, shy, carrying a CIGAR BOX,
text: gazing at Boyce and Ford as if they were movie stars.
speaker_heading: CHLOE (CONT'D)
dialog: My brother, Paul.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Oughtta get him outta here.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
text: The only soldiers he's ever seen are
dialog: Nazis. I wanted him to know better.
text: Chloe crosses to a junk-pile, pulls out a hand-made CRUTCH,
text: carved from a tree-limb. She hands it to Ford.
speaker_heading: CHLOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, take this. It was my father's.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Was?
text: Chloe nods. Boyce about to dig deeper, when--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Thank you.
text: In other words, "Au revoir." Chloe bristles a bit...
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You make too much noise.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Sorry. I'll try to bleed more
dialog: quietly.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Do you need anything else? Water?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: We're all set. Thanks.
text: He turns to the window, watching Kiebel exit the Town Square.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Vien, Paul.
text: Paul answers her - he wants to stay up here. She says it
text: again, "Vien." No dice. Pretty humiliating, being defied by
dialog: your kid brother. And Ford is unamused.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Like I said...
text: She pulls on Paul's arm; he digs in, sitting on the attic
text: floor, opening up his cigar box, pulling out some MARBLES.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya like chocolate, Kid?
text: Ford takes a CHOCOLATE BAR from his trousers, holds it up for
text: Paul to see. The answer is a big yes. Ford dangles the
text: chocolate bar... then tosses it down the steps: "Fetch!"
text: Paul doesn't move. Ford shrugs. Chloe storms down the steps,
text: angry at Ford and Paul. The ATTIC DOOR shuts. Now it's two
text: G.I.'s and a kid playing with his marbles.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Maybe we could get them out of here.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Let's win the war first, awright? Got
dialog: a mission planned for 18 men and only
text: one-and-a-half men to do it.
text: Boyce nods, rebuked. Ford jumps back into mission-mode:
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT’D)
dialog: Use your flashlight to signal when
dialog: you're in place, two clicks. Then hit
dialog: ‘em with the grenades. There'll be
dialog: some smoke so be careful ya don't
dialog: shoot anybody friendly.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: You too.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You'll be fine. Get in there, get to
dialog: our guys, and find out where that
dialog: ordnance went. You remember how to
dialog: set the charges?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I think so.
text: Ford pulls the DETONATOR from his belt.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: FORD
text: Wires go to the terminal, plunger
text: turns down and to the right.
dialog: (Boyce nods)
dialog: See? It's a milk-run.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Yeah, ‘cept they have grenades too.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Way I hear it, half the German
text: grenades are duds.
dialog: (Boyce eyes him)
dialog: That's a fact; you can look it up.
text: Boyce appreciates the effort - but he's scared to death.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: (at Paul)
dialog: Hey Kid, whatsay ya tie a couple tin
dialog: cans to your ankles and run around
dialog: the Square drawing fire from the
dialog: guards?
text: Paul, of course, didn't get a word of that. Ford shrugs.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Another collaborator. Go.
text: Boyce nods, turns to go. Then he STOPS, reaches into his
text: jacket - and pulls out that bulky ENVELOPE addressed to his
text: parents, the one he almost handed over on the plane.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Just in case...
text: Ford takes the envelope. Boyce can barely breathe, but he
text: goes - stepping over Paul - then down the stairs, pure dread.
text: Step, step, step, to the DOOR. Boyce nudges it open... into:
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - GREAT ROOM - CONTINUING (NIGHT)
text: Chloe's here. To Boyce's left, a BEDROOM DOOR OPENS and--
scene_heading: --Instant JUMP-SCARE: Chloe's grand-mother ANNELISE, 70,
text: emerging. Her eyes are a milky white. And the skin on her
text: arms is gruesome - COAL BLACK up to the shoulders.
dialog: 
text: Looks like the skin we saw on Madame Lesner's face, the flesh
text: eaten by disease, or frostbite, or bacteria. Or all three.
text: Necrotid tissue, bubbling with blisters.
text: Boyce stiffens. Chloe's almost glad he got to see this--
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You ask what they do in that lab?
dialog: (re: Annelise's ARMS)
dialog: This.
text: Boyce, pole-axed, just stares for a second.
speaker_heading: CHLOE (CONT'D)
dialog: They came for my father too. When he
dialog: returned he couldn't walk anymore.
dialog: His legs... Then they came back for
dialog: him. This time he didn't come home at
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I'm sorry, Chole.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Every house in this village has a
dialog: story like that.
dialog: If Boyce had time, he'd sit down and discuss it. But he
text: doesn't. He heads for the window, then crouches low beside
text: it, timing that SEARCHLIGHT out there. Chloe drifts over.
text: On a table is a PHOTO, taken 5 YEARS AGO: Chloe-at-14, with
dialog: what must be her mother and grandfather and Annelise, and
text: Chloe's (now-dead) father, ALAIN, holding Paul (at 2).
text: Boyce notes it, just for a second, then looks outside again.
speaker_heading: CHLOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there anything I can do to help?
dialog: Anything you need?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
text: An ambulance. An armored Division. A
dialog: night of sleep.
text: Outside, the searchlight recedes. It's time to go. He steels
text: himself, anxious as hell. Checks his gear: grenades, etc. -
text: then heads for the back door - no goodbye... until:
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You can't leave it standing. Okay?
dialog: (Boyce half-turns...)
dialog: The church. When you kill those men,
dialog: you have to blow it up or burn it -
dialog: but don't just leave it there. Can
dialog: you do that? Can you bury it?
text: Boyce pauses - regards her and her grandmother - the tragedy
text: of war right there on their faces. It touches him.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Sure. You bet.
text: Chloe smiles bravely - there's a connection here.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Merci.
text: He nods - almost past her, when--
speaker_heading: FORD (0.S.)
dialog: Ed! We got company!
text: Ford, whispering loud and urgent from upstairs. Boyce's head
text: snaps around to the window - Chloe's too - where they see:
text: Dr. Bruel - labcoat, doctor's bag - approaching this house.
text: Escorting Bruel is an SS-Guard, Pvt. Wafner.
dialog: 
text: This is bad. Very. Chloe gasps. INSTANT TERROR--
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: They know you're here! They must know
dialog: you're here!
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: What're you--
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: He never comes at night! And he never
dialog: brings a guard with him!
text: She hurriedly translates for Annelise, who is instantly
dialog: terrified. Boyce processing all that - fast...
speaker_heading: CHLOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Paul! Paul! Vite! Mama!
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/INT. LAURENT HOME - ATTIC - CONTINUING
text: Ford's at the glassless window. Paul on the floor.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Ed! Get up here, Dammit!
dialog: (at Paul)
dialog: You! Go!
text: But Paul's just shut down. Pure fear. He can barely make his
dialog: mouth form the word "Chloe?"
text: «»+-as Boyce flies up the Attic Steps, hurdling over him.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Whadda we do?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: They come up, we blast ‘em.
dialog: (Boyce nods tightly)
dialog: Don't have time for this, Ed.
dialog: 
text: Boyce knows all too well. He drops to his belly at the TOP OF
text: THE ATTIC STEPS, rifle pointed toward the room below. Ford
text: lines up beside him, rifle ready.
text: BACK TO CHLOE - she sits by the fire, trying to look utterly
dialog: natural. Annelise too, as--
text: THE FRONT DOOR IS THROWN OPEN - and here's Dr. Bruel, flanked
text: by SS Pvt. Wafner. Bruel twitches a bit, that tic of his.
text: He nods to TWO BEDROOM DOORS, says something that must be
text: "Get them". Chloe nods obediently.
text: BACK TO THE ATTIC - There's a KNOTHOLE in the floor, through
text: which Boyce and Ford can look down into the Great Room below -
text: where they see Chloe, at that bedroom door:
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Mama? Grandpere?
text: BACK TO THE GREAT ROOM - Two doors open. GUILLAUME, Chloe's
text: grandfather, emerges from one. Loyal and silent, he stands
text: beside Annelise. Then, from the other door, Chloe's MOTHER:
text: This is MARIE-ELENA, pure steel, embittered by war. She
text: mentions the lateness of the hour to Bruel, in French. He
text: snaps back at her angrily. Marie-Elena eyes the floor.
text: BACK TO THE ATTIC - Ford peeks through that knothole now...
text: And sees Annelise for the first time. What the??? Boyce nods.
text: DOWNSTAIRS - Annelise is silent, stoic. Wafner asks, in
text: German, "Where's the boy?" Chloe tightens. If Wafner goes up
dialog: those steps, WE'RE ALL DEAD. So, aloud:
speaker_heading: CHLOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Paul?
text: ATTIC - Paul remains frozen in place, too petrified to move.
text: Ford eyes the kid, "Get down there." Paul's so terrified he
text: DROPS ONE OF THOSE MARBLES.
text: It falls to the floor - a noise that feels concussive in this
text: tense silence. Everyone tightens, every head turns.
text: ..-including Wafner's. And Bruel's.
dialog: 48.
text: .+..as the damn marble starts to roll down those steps - a
text: waterfall of SOUND that feels endless:
dialog: TAP-roll-TAP-roll-TAP-roll...
text: Ford bracing now. Boyce watching Wafner and Bruel for a
text: reaction. Paul trembling. TAP-roll... The Laurents frozen...
text: ..+-until the marble hits the last step and rolls toward
text: Chloe, and she puts her foot on it. Silence...
text: Paul reappears at the bottom of the steps now. Chloe hands
text: him his marble. He nods, thanks. Apologizes to Bruel.
text: Then Paul and Chloe and the rest of the family STAND IN A
text: LINE like soldiers at Roll Call, shoulder to shoulder.
text: All eyes on Wafner and Bruel. A silent, agonizing moment...
text: ..-until Dr. Bruel opens his bag, pulls out a SYRINGE, and
text: approaches Annelise, her arms coal-black and blistered.
text: Boyce and Ford watching.
text: Bruel drifts BEHIND her, kneels down, finds a suitable vein
text: in the back of her knee. Her leg has bruises all over it,
text: like a junkie. In goes the NEEDLE. Annelise silent.
text: ...as he draws her blood - which is BLACK.
text: Not red. Not dark red. BLACK. Boyce and Ford stare in
text: disbelief. Oddly, Annelise's family doesn't react at all.
text: Bruel calmly caps his syringe, takes out another...
text: ...and moves on to Guillaume, who sticks out his arm - which
text: is when we see that HIS FINGERTIPS ARE BLACK. Both hands.
text: Bruel draws blood - also BLACK - from Guillaume's right arm.
text: Boyce and Ford watching, dazed...
text: Bruel caps syringe #2, uses a ruler from his bag to measure
text: the BLACKNESS on Guillaume's right hand. A FINGERNAIL extends
text: awkwardly. Bruel yanks it off. Guillaume doesn't feel it.
text: But Ford and Boyce sure do, wincing.
text: Then Bruel asks Annelise to stick out her right hand.
text: That's impossible for her; the tissue is just dead. The arm
text: won't move. Guillaume reaches over, lifts it for her. A
text: gesture of great kindness, but sad as hell.
dialog: 49.
text: Bruel examines her right hand. Taps on it. Once. Twice...
text: And it falls off.
text: Right there, on to the floor. Chloe gasps. Paul cries.
text: Boyce and Ford stunned. WHAT THE FUCK?!
text: But there it is, on the floor - her bloodless HAND, dead
text: tissue. Guillaume fights back a tear. Marie-Elena too. Paul
text: trembling. Annelise is stunned, but oddly unpained.
text: ...-as Bruel makes a dispassionate note in a NOTEBOOK, and
text: mumbles something to them in French. Then he closes up his
text: bag, and says to Wafner, in German, "Let's go."
dialog: Wafner says what must be "I'll be along in a moment."
text: Bruel shrugs, turns to go. Marie-Elena calls out to him with
text: a question. Bruel brushes her off with:
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: Heil Hitler.
text: He grabs the hand, tosses it into his bag, and he's gone. No
text: one speaks. Wafner says in German to Annelise, "Poor luck for
dialog: you, Grandma." Annelise is silent.
text: BACK TO THE ATTIC - Ford looks to his WATCH, gestures to
text: Boyce, "WE HAVE TO MOVE". Boyce nods; he knows. But:
text: DOWNSTAIRS - Wafner tells Chloe's family members (but NOT
text: CHLOE) to leave the room. They hesitate. He eyes them coldly,
text: tells them again - this time with his SIDEARM unholstered.
text: With looks of apology to Chloe, the family recedes, their
text: bedroom doors shutting. Chloe's alone. Wafner smiles.
text: ...then crosses to Chloe, stopping an inch away from her, his
text: back to the attic steps. Now we understand: he puts a hand to
text: her face, stroking it, Chloe frozen in place...
text: Ford _and Boyce watch, her face visible to them. Fuck...
text: Then he lets his hand drop lazily down Chloe's neck, his
text: nails grazing slowly over the outside of her blouse, tracing
text: her breasts. Chloe tries not to shake. Or cry.
text: Impossible. A tear starts to roll down her cheek.
text: Ford is outraged, livid. Dying to shoot this bastard... Boyce
text: eyes Ford as if to say, "Don't, Lew. PLEASE."
text: Wafner starts unbuttoning the top of her blouse...
dialog: 50.
text: She shakes. Wafner finds that exciting. He whispers, in
text: German: "You're trembling. Shall I hold you?" Pawing at her.
text: And Ford's seen enough. He pulls the TRENCH-KNIFE from his
text: belt - about to throw it. Boyce terrified.
text: But just then, Wafner notices something at his feet - that
text: CHOCOLATE BAR, G.I. ISSUE. He bends down, grabs it, looks to
text: Chloe. Her eyes go wide. Wafner reaches for his WHISTLE--
text: No choice now - Ford lets the knife FLY. It buries itself in
text: Wafner's back. He groans, pitches forward. Chloe stunned.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Get him, Ed!
text: Boyce, improvising, hurries down the steps, puts a PISTOL to
text: Wafner's head and covers Wafner's mouth. Marie-Elena bursts
text: out of her room.
text: .»-and sees Boyce, an American. She starts hissing at Chloe
dialog: in French - a terrified "How could you bring him in here?!"
text: .»+.as Boyce pulls a bleeding Wafner up the attic steps. It's
text: all happening in a blur--
text: Chloe follows them up, Marie-Elena still berating her from
text: below, Chloe hissing back.
text: IN THE ATTIC - Wafner hits the top step. Ford puts the tip of
text: his M-1 against Wafner's skull.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT’D)
dialog: Tell him to put his hands up.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: He speaks Eng--
text: But before she can finish the word, Wafner turns and ATTACKS -
text: surprising them completely, he upends Ford and knocks Boyce's
text: gun to the ground, fast. He reaches for his sidearm.
text: Ford swipes at it with the crutch. The gun goes flying--
text: Wafner dives for his gun. Boyce too. Two strong young men
text: locked up. Ford trying to get back on his feet. Marie-Elena
text: horrified at the bottom of the steps, berating Chloe, as--
text: Wafner, strong as hell, pushes Boyce away and grabs the GUN--
text: --gets to his knees, about to fire at Boyce when--
text: THUMP. Ford, upright again, RIFLE-BUTTS Wafner in the back of
text: the head. Wafner drops, half-conscious. And it's over.
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
dialog: Silence... A breath...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Tie this bastard up to that chair.
text: Boyce grabs Wafner, throws him onto a rickety CHAIR. Chloe
text: spots some frayed ROPE, tosses it to Boyce, who ties Wafner's
text: hands behind the chair. Marie-Elena still wailing from below.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell her to shut up. We'll be out of
dialog: here as soon as we've done our job.
text: Chloe starts to translate into French. Her mom unmollified--
text: ...as Wafner, his fog clearing now, begins to HOLLER. Loud.
text: Ford grabs a wad of BLOODY CLOTH from the table and jams it
text: into Wafner's mouth, muffling him. An unrehearsed mess.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Tie his feet too.
text: Done. Now Wafner's truly stuck. Chloe, enraged, overloading,
text: crosses toward him... and spits into his face, seething.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: That's for my grandmother!
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: They did that to her in the lab?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: They made her drink something, she
dialog: said it was like tar. My father had
dialog: to drink it too.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Why do Nazis do anything?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Tell me about that doctor.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: His name's Bruel. He delivered me,
dialog: and Paul. Now he's more Nazi than the
dialog: Nazis. Half the village has been in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: You too?
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: No. The Nazis have other plans for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Not anymore. Ya hear that, Fritz?
text: Wafner's silent. Ford, hobbled, pulls up a chair beside him.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Almost morning, Lew.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I know what time it is.
dialog: (at Wafner: )
dialog: Start talking. How many soldiers are
dialog: garrisoned in that church?
text: Ford pulls the BLOODY CLOTH from Wafner's mouth. Again,
text: WAFNER SHOUTS OUT LOUD. Ford re-gags him, angrily--
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: If I wanted an opera I'd go to the
dialog: Met. Talk, Dummy.
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: I don't know anything.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (just snapped)
dialog: ‘Course you don't.
text: Lightning-fast, he digs a TRENCH-KNIFE into Wafner’s leg.
dialog: 
text: Wafner’s eyes roll back in pain, Boyce shocked. Ford LEAVES
text: THE KNIFE THERE... and twists it - then:
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Again. How many soldiers up there?
text: Wafner still doesn’t answer. So Ford twists it again.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are your men stationed? Where
dialog: are they keeping the POW's?
text: Wafner shuts his eyes. Ford twists it again. Boyce frozen--
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: No one’s coming to help you, Adolf;
dialog: they’re all gonna be dead soon. If
dialog: you co-operate with us we'll see that
dialog: you're handed over to the US Army. If
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: you don't you're gonna die in this
dialog: attic and rot like a bad French
dialog: cheese. Understand?
dialog: (another twist)
dialog: Understand?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: That knife belongs in his heart--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: ‘Course it does. Just not yet.
text: Ford YANKS THE KNIFE OUT, un-gags Wafner, who spits something
text: out _in German at Chloe. She snaps back. Now Ford's irritated--
text: So he drives it into Wafner's OTHER LEG, deep. Instant agony.
text: Wafner cries, his eyes rolling back - as Ford covers Wafner's
text: nose and mouth with the bloody cloth, SUFFOCATING HIM. Boyce
text: slack-jawed: "Are we about to KILL this guy?"
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you gonna talk? Are you gonna
dialog: talk?
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: Yes!!!
text: Ford leans on the knife like the throttle of an airplane,
text: pushing it in deeper - then lowers the cloth--
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Lew...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: How many troops garrisoned there?
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: Four! Please take this out!
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Two POW's. Where are they?
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: In the lab! Please!
speaker_heading: FORD
text: A dead G.I. was brought in on a
dialog: motorcycle. Why?
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: I don't know. Experiments.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: What kind of experiments? He's dead.
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: Research! I don't know!
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Bullshit! He had explosives on him.
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: In the lab! A cabinet! Please--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Why the house call in the middle of
dialog: the night? What's the rush?
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: The invasion! The doctor wants to
dialog: complete his work before the town is
dialog: overrun.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What _ kind of work?
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: I don't know! We are told so little!
dialog: (Ford pushes DEEPER)
dialog: I don't interfere with him, I swear
dialog: it! I just do as I'm told!
text: A sob suddenly bubbles from his throat - the guy's just in
text: too much pain to go on. His head droops, whipped...
speaker_heading: WAFNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Please...
text: Ford yanks the knife out. Wafner sobs quietly. Boyce silent.
text: Ford checks the time, reaches into Wafner's breast-pocket,
text: pulls out the pack of CIGARETTES he knew would be there...
text: And shoves one between Wafner's lips. Wafner appreciates it.
text: Then Ford pulls the ENVELOPE from his own jacket - the one
text: addressed to his mother in Brooklyn. He rips it open.
text: Inside is a BRASS ZIPPO LIGHTER - looks like it's been
text: through fire, literally; it's got SCORCH-MARKS on it.
text: He lights Wafner's cigarette, as:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: See this? My Old Man ran into a
dialog: burning house one day with this
text: lighter in his pocket - died saving a
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: couple kids. Maybe they were
dialog: relatives of yours, it's a German
text: neighborhood. Madoc Avenue.
dialog: (still no reply)
dialog: I always hated that part of town.
text: He yanks the cigarette from Wafner's lips, pockets the Zippo.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT’D)
dialog: Break's over. What else does my buddy
dialog: here need to know?
text: Wafner sighs. Ford waves the lit end of that cigarette, ready
text: to BURN Wafner's FACE with it. And Wafner relents--
speaker_heading: WAFNER
text: One of the prisoners is dead already.
dialog: The other is tied to a table. Your
text: explosives are in the cabinet
text: farthest from the door.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Thanks. You're a pal.
dialog: (at Boyce: )
dialog: Get going. You're late for church.
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: You'll hand me over to your Army, say
dialog: I co-operated?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Sure.
text: He pounds Wafner in the temple with the butt-end of that
text: knife, knocking Wafner unconscious... Then turns to Chloe:
dialog: She goes.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Go downstairs. Tell your family not
dialog: to move. I want them INSIDE.
text: Just Ford, Boyce, and an unconscious Wafner now.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT’D)
dialog: Nice sleepy little French village.
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: (peers out the window)
dialog: You're looking for four guards, plus
dialog: the doctor. He might be armed. You--
dialog: (stops himself--)
dialog: Just get going, before they notice
text: he's gone.
text: Boyce gathers his gear, heads down the stairs, then halts:
dialog: 56.
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - ATTIC STEPS - CONTINUING
text: Chloe's waiting at the bottom - which means she heard all
text: this. Boyce reaches her, thinking she's about to say "Good
dialog: Luck" or something. But instead--
dialog: 
text: --she KISSES ; there's an urgency to it, a desperation.
text: Her eyes wet - she whispers into his ear:
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Please, please... take me away from
dialog: here. I can't stand it anymore.
text: Boyce, his face flushed, can barely manage a half-nod. Chloe
text: gathers herself... then opens the door--
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - GREAT ROOM - CONTINUING
text: Chloe's family awaits. They note Boyce and his rifle... and
text: for just a second, Boyce feels brave. A liberator. Then:
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You go to die for us?
text: Boyce deflates, just like that. Chloe reddening...
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Your English needs some work, kid.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: He meant "fight" for us.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Let's hope so.
text: Chloe nods. Boyce goes out the back door. We STAY HERE - with
text: Annelise, watching him go. Then:
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/INT. LAURENT HOME - ATTIC - RESUMING
text: Ford perches at that window, DAWN just breaking--
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. BEHIND THE LAURENT HOME - SAME (DAWN)
text: Boyce emerges, just as...
text: A HUGE NOISE hits him - shaking the sky: HEAVY GUNS in the
text: distance. Big ones. BOOM-BABOOM. Thunderous sounds--
dialog: And Boyce knows where they're coming from: US Destroyers (and
text: German pillboxes). It's now June 6, 1944.
text: D-Day. His watch says 5:45. BOOM-BABOOM.
dialog: 57.
text: BACK TO FORD - The GUNS of Normandy echoing up here, played
text: off of Ford's face - steely, determined...
text: BACK TO CHLOE AND HER FAMILY - They hear it too. The
text: Invasion! There's hope in Chloe's eyes. Paul's too. Then--
text: Behind them, Annelise asks Guillaume to open the front door
text: for her. He does so. Annelise steps outside.
text: BACK TO BOYCE - He sends up a silent prayer, D-DAY POUNDING
text: in the distance. VERY LITTLE COVER between him and the church
text: - a few barns, that's all. He steels himself...
text: BACK TO FORD - He looks out the window, trying to spot Boyce.
dialog: Instead Ford sees:
text: ON THE FOOTHILL - The SS Guards from the church emerge now,
text: looking with FIELD-GLASSES toward the GUNS on the Coast.
text: AND THE PEOPLE OF CIELBLANC - They too step out of their
text: homes, awakened by the heavy guns. 50 PEOPLE IN ALL. Women,
dialog: children, older folks, no men.
text: A few of these people aren't whole: an older man MISSING A
text: LEG. A TEENAGER in a wheelchair. A LAME CHILD spasming in his
text: mother's arms, his eyes milky white. Ford notes it all.
text: Then, a surprise - visible right below this very window:
text: Annelise walking to the center of the Square, minus one hand,
text: both arms BLACK. But here she is, marching toward the well.
text: The others regarding her in frightened silence...
dialog: 
text: ...Ford watching, thrown, as:
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. CIELBLANC - OUTSKIRTS - SAME
text: Boyce ducking behind a barn. Every step is a danger.
text: BACK TO THE TOWN SQUARE - Annelise stops at the well; every
text: head turns. She's gruesome. What's she doing out here?
text: Then, even stranger, she starts to sing. A LULLABY, her voice
text: shaky. Singing, in the middle of the square, odd as Hell:
speaker_heading: ANNELISE (FRENCH, SINGING)
dialog: Nous n'irons plus au bois/Les
dialog: lauriers sont coupes...
text: BACK TO FORD - confused at first, then he gets it.
text: BACK TO ANNELISE - People staring at her now - all wondering
dialog: why this old woman is singing. Here's why: She's turning all
text: eyes in town onto herself.
dialog: 58.
text: BACK TO BOYCE - he gets it too. With the villagers
text: distracted, he exits the town for the brush of the foothill.
dialog: 
text: BACK TO ANNELISE, singing, the villagers staring at her. From
text: here, she can see Boyce scaling the foothill. Good...
text: BACK TO FORD, in the attic, watching Boyce too, as:
text: BOYCE SCALES THE FOOTHILL - ducking in and out of trees for
text: cover. His breaths are shallow, anxious.
text: ANNELISE - still at it. A rotting woman singing a lullaby.
text: Madame Lesner, her face gruesome, leans out her window,
text: barking in French at Annelise, "Stop this." D-Day pounding.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. CHURCH - FRONT GATE - SAME
text: Walking the church perimeter is Richt. He spots Annelise in
text: the village below, and sights her with his rifle.
text: BACK TO BOYCE - hurrying, trying to be invisible, as:
text: ANNELISE - still singing. Lesner growing more irritated,
dialog: shouting, "Stop this! You're frightening everyone!"
text: BACK TO THE CHURCH - Richt has her lined up. He starts to
dialog: squeeze the trigger...
text: BACK TO CHLOE - she and her family watching the Square -
text: Lesner is now YELLING at Annelise, who keeps singing.
text: BACK TO BOYCE - moving in and out of trees...
text: BACK TO THE CHURCH - Richt pulls the trigger -- just as Dr.
text: Bruel appears, swiping angrily at Richt's rifle.
dialog: 
text: BACK TO THE SQUARE - The SHOT rips through the air, missing
text: its target but hitting the gallows. The villagers shocked.
text: BACK TO FORD - every part of him tensing.
text: BACK TO THE CHURCH - Bruel berates Richt, in German. "Who
dialog: gave you the right to interfere with my work here! You almost
dialog: killed one of my subjects!"
text: BACK TO THE SQUARE - the villagers SCATTER back to their
text: homes in fear, doors slamming. Lesner shuts her window...
text: ..-but Annelise just keeps singing.
text: BACK TO CHLOE - Her family staring out at Annelise...
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. FOOTHILL/BEHIND THE CHURCH - RESUMING
text: Boyce passes behind the REAR GATE of the church, unseen,
text: heading for the TREELINE behind the church...
dialog: 
text: He finds a ridge that looks DOWN on the church grounds.
dialog: Perfect - he can do some killing from here.
text: BACK TO ANNELISE - She sees him back there, sees Bruel in the
text: foreground. Mission accomplished. She stops singing.
text: .-.climbs on to the lip of that WELL, her eyes on Bruel--
text: ...and throws herself in. Just like that.
text: BACK TO BOYCE - Eyes wide, can't believe it.
text: CHLOE AND HER FAMILY - They scream. Paul, distraught, springs
text: up and runs for the attic steps.
text: BACK TO BRUEL - He turns abruptly and heads back inside the
text: church, leaving Richt alone out here.
text: BACK TO THE TOWN SQUARE - utter silence and stillness. Not a
text: sound from the bottom of the well...
text: BACK TO FORD - He lowers his head, just for a moment.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Rest in peace, Lady.
text: Just then, Paul bursts into the attic, utterly unglued. He
text: starts SHOUTING AT FORD in French, sobbing, his timing awful.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, Kid. You gotta go.
dialog: (Paul keeps shouting)
dialog: I'm serious. Beat it.
text: BACK TO BOYCE - It's TIME. He eyes the RADIO-JAMMING TOWER
text: while laying out his TRENCH KNIFE and GRENADES. Then he
text: catches the sun on the KNIFE. Two REFLECTIONS.
text: BACK TO FORD - With Paul still shouting and a bleeding Wafner
text: across the room, Ford sees the signal-flashes from Boyce...
text: and looks through the SCOPE of his rifle, as:
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT’D)
dialog: (to downstairs)
dialog: Hey! Get him outta here already!
text: BACK TO BOYCE. He sets the knife down, steadies himself...
dialog: 60.
text: Then he pulls a pin on GRENADE #1 - hurls it at the church's
text: back door. Pulls a pin on GRENADE #2 - hurls it on the ROOF.
text: -as we MOVE IN TIGHT ON FORD, in the window, rifle sighted.
text: -and TIGHT ON BOYCE, on the ridge, ready to fire... when:
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. CHURCH - GROUNDS - RESUMING
text: BOOM! Grenade #1 blows the BACK DOOR off its hinges. LOUD.
text: BOOM! Grenade #2 blows a small hole in the roof.
text: --AT THE CHURCH GATE - Richt races toward the blasts and--
text: --IN THE ATTIC - BANG. Ford FIRES, missing high. Re-aims.
text: Squeezes off another shot - BANG. Paul STOPS YELLING as--
text: --BACK TO RICHT - hit in the back. He goes down...
text: «+-Just as Kiebel and SS PVT. KOGAN emerge from the church,
dialog: armed. Captain Mueller too. But:
text: It's an AMBUSH: Boyce starts firing. POP-POP-POP-POP-POP...
text: --Ford fires too. POP-POP-POP-POP. Paul just watching.
text: --Kogan, Kiebel, and Mueller are shredded. They go down.
dialog: 
text: And then it's over. Just like that. An eery silence.
text: BACK TO BOYCE - perfectly still, low to the ground.
text: BACK TO FORD - perfectly still, in the attic window, as--
text: BACK TO THE SQUARE - Every door stays shut. No one steps
text: outside to see what happened. D-DAY still thumping from afar.
text: BEHIND THE CHURCH - Boyce regards the bodies... four of them
text: lying there - but no Dr. Bruel.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Where are ya, Doc?
text: IN THE ATTIC - Ford's thinking the same thing. Paul drifts
text: over, looks out the window... The bad guys are dead.
text: BACK TO BOYCE - He hops down from the treeline, rifle slung.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH GROUNDS - BEHIND THE CHURCH - CONTINUING (DAWN)
text: Smoke wafts. Boyce enters the church warily, through the
text: blown-out BACK DOOR, with D-DAY thumping in the distance...
dialog: 61.
text: BACK TO FORD - He and Paul watch Boyce disappear inside.
text: On Paul's face, a look of liberation. Awe. He opens that
text: cigar-box of his, reaches inside, pulls something out:
text: It's an old French WORLD WAR I MEDAL... for VALOR.
text: With wordless ceremony, Paul extends it to Ford and pins it
text: on him. Ford can't help feeling touched - as:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - GROUND LEVEL/KITCHEN - CONTINUING
text: Sunlight and smoke. The sound of RUNNING WATER. Boyce enters.
text: No one's in here, just a running faucet. He crosses through,
text: then edges into a SHADOWY HALLWAY. Not a sound. Then into:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - GROUND LEVEL/SANCTUARY - CONTINUING
text: Silence. Dust hovering, some glass shattered. Boyce passes
text: the figure of Christ on the altar. No time to acknowledge it.
text: He spots a door up ahead... approaches, then into:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - STAIRWELL - RESUMING
text: Dimly-lit by a single blub. Boyce descends in silence - then
dialog: through a door, to:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
text: A long SUBTERRANEAN HALLWAY. Boyce walks. Half-open DOORS to
text: his right and left. He pushes one open:
text: The room's empty. A MILITARY RADIO sits on a table. Boyce
text: eyes it, then continues down the hallway. Opens another door:
text: An ARMORY: stacked RIFLES, ammo on shelves, two tall LOCKERS.
text: Boyce backs out, drifting farther down the hall. Where is
text: that damn Doctor? A DOOR up ahead. Boyce approaches silently.
text: ..+-and nudges the door open with the tip of his rifle--
text: ...revealing an EMPTY PITCH-BLACK SPACE. Feels big. His hands
text: fumble along the wall for a LIGHT-SWITCH. He finds it. CLICK:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - BASEMENT/LAB - CONTINUING
text: LIGHTS POP ON above us in a sequence. CH-CH-CH-CH-CH. Rows of
text: them. It takes ten full seconds for them all to illuminate.
text: This is the LAB we saw in that 16 mm. film. And it is HUGE.
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
text: A CEILING-TO-FLOOR CURTAIN divides the lab in half. On this
text: side of it we see endless rows of LAB-STATIONS, EQUIPMENT,
text: sinks, burners, beakers. A pair of EYEBALLS in a jar...
text: Oh, and 25 DEAD GERMAN SOLDIERS, on GRANITE SLABS.
text: These are the BODIES Boyce saw trucked in; each has been
text: stripped down to white BOXER SHORTS and rubbed with oil.
text: ..-but every gunshot wound, every hole left behind by an
text: exploding shell, they're all evident. Boyce winces a bit.
text: Covering the walls are RUNIC LETTERS and paintings of ANCIENT
text: TEUTONIC KNIGHTS. Swastikas too. And two crossed CEREMONIAL
text: AXES, right out of the Middle Ages.
text: In a glass cabinet are 500 VIALS OF BLACK BLOOD. One sits on
text: a GAS STOVE in a POT OF BOILING WATER. Boyce turns the stove
text: off. And hears a MACHINE-LIKE SOUND:
text: A pump, sounds like it's on the other side of that CEILING-TO-
text: FLOOR CURTAIN. Boyce steps through it, rifle slung - and sees
text: the OTHER HALF of this vast lab... It's a horror:
text: FIFTEEN PEOPLE - "SUBJECTS" - barely human now, each of them
text: TIED BY THEIR HANDS AND FEET TO HOSPITAL BEDS.
text: They were villagers once. Now they look more like CREATURES.
text: Their flesh is black and blistered, everywhere - necrotid
text: tissue bubbling on their arms, faces, necks, torsos. Their
text: eyes milky white, staring in a state of sustained torture.
text: On each bed Boyce finds a "PATIENT FILE" complete with BEFORE
text: AND AFTER PHOTOS - human decay, chronicled in German. Beside
text: one of the beds, a 16 mm. CAMERA stands on a tripod...
text: He drifts a bit closer, breathless. These people are barely
text: alive, most of them unconscious, some of them vegetative;
text: something is corroding them from the inside out:
text: Connected to each villager is a machine of pumps and valves,
text: an AUTOJECTOR, pumping a thick black substance - looks like
text: TAR - into each subject, circulating it mechanically.
text: On BOTH ARMS of every subject are BLOOD DRAWS, feeding black
text: blood into bottles that sit on the floor.
text: It's like a massive, gruesome dairy farm. But why??? Boyce
text: drifts past each bed, shocked, speechless.
text: Then, another shock - AUTOJECTOR #16 is connected by TUBES to
text: a_DISEMBODIED DOG'S-HEAD, which sits on a tray.
dialog: 63.
text: Somehow, impossibly, the Autojector is keeping the head
text: alive. Its MOUTH moves - just took in a breath. My God...
text: Autojector #17 is hooked up to a HUMAN HEART, beating,
text: suspended in air by STRINGS over the OPEN CHEST of Tibbet.
text: Tibbet's EYES have been removed. Holy Hell. Boyce shaken.
text: Then, behind him, labored BREATHING. He turns, rifle slung.
text: In BED #3 is another villager/creature, suffering, tied up,
text: his body entirely BLISTERED and BLACK. His eyes crazed. Boyce
text: stares - something drawing him toward this creature, when--
text: A JUMP-SCARE - it BOLTS UP - still tied to the bed but
text: lunging at Boyce with such force that the bed actually
text: TOPPLES OVER, slamming on its side to the floor. That fast.
text: Boyce steps back, the Creature now pressed against the floor,
text: its breaths rattling. Boyce not sure what to do, as:
speaker_heading: A VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Help... please.
text: That was barely audible, but AMERICAN. Boyce turns--
text: There's another CURTAINED-OFF SECTION up ahead. He gets there
text: - pulls back the curtain...
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Rosenfeld!
text: Rosenfeld, his hands and feet TIED to the rods of his bed,
text: turns, glassy-eyed. This man's been tortured. Mumbling:
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: I didn't talk. I didn't--
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: --where's the Doctor?
dialog: (Rosenfeld doesn't know)
dialog: Okay. We're gettin' you outta here.
text: He starts to untie Rosenfeld, anxiety pumping--
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell is all this? They--
text: Just then, ANOTHER SOUND--
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: Boyce!
text: Boyce turns - a BLUR behind him - and:
dialog: 64.
text: Dr. Bruel emerges from shadow. He'd been hiding there. He
text: RIFLE-BUTTS Boyce in the head. ALL GOES BLACK. We CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - ATTIC - MORNING
text: Ford sits at the attic window, awaiting any sign of Boyce.
text: HIS POV - OUT THE WINDOW: Cielblanc is quiet. Normandy's
text: beaches are not. BOOM-BABOOM.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: That really ought to be looked at.
text: Chloe, at the top of the steps, gestures to Ford's blood-
text: soaked pantleg. An uneasy tension between them.
text: Ford shrugs, "Go ahead." Chloe crosses past Wafner and sits.
text: She unties Ford's boot; he keeps his eyes out the window -—
dialog: despite the searing pain. Mission, mission, mission.
text: She pulls the boot off. AGONY. Ford just grits his teeth.
text: Chloe pulls up his pantleg, pulls down his bloody sock -
text: regarding what one of her traps did to a human leg.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Arky Vaughn had an ankle like that, a
dialog: couple years back. Cost him half a
dialog: season.
text: Chloe has no idea what he's talking about.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Brooklyn Dodgers? Baseball?
dialog: (she's a blank)
dialog: And they say we're uncultured.
text: She cleans the wound with Iodine...
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I'm sorry - about your father.
dialog: (Ford shrugs)
dialog: He was a fireman?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: He was a house-painter.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Oh. Then why did he run into--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You done yet?
text: She holds up a BANDAGE, starts to roll it around his ankle.
dialog: 65.
text: .»+-as he eyes that VALOR medal pinned to his jacket; it
text: bothers him. He takes it off, shoves it in his pocket.
text: Then he sees something horrible atop that foothill--
text: ON THE CHURCH GROUNDS - a door opens... and Bruel emerges.
text: BACK TO FORD - Instant alarm: Ed's in trouble. Ford bolts up,
text: grabbing his rifle and crutch, his foot unshod and bloody.
text: BACK TO BRUEL - He eyes the bodies of Kiebel, Kogan, Richt,
text: Mueller, and he sighs. Then he picks up the body of Kiebel...
text: .-.and carries it back inside the church. Just like that.
text: BACK TO FORD - hobbling past Chloe, toward the attic steps...
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You're leaving us?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Ed's in trouble.
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - GREAT ROOM - CONTINUING
text: Ford descends noisily on his crutch - then emerges, Chloe
text: right behind him. The Laurents turn.
speaker_heading: FORD
text: STAY INSIDE. The Kraut's tied up.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: How can you help him on one leg?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You just stay here.
text: He heads for the door. Marie-Elena mumbles something at him
text: in accented English. Chloe reacts.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: She said take the truck.
dialog: (Ford thrown)
text: Madame Lesner has a truck in her
dialog: barn. That one, there. To move him if
text: he is hurt.
text: Ford nods "Thanks". Marie-Elena nods back. He steps outside.
dialog: 66.
scene_heading: EXT. CIELBLANC - TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUING
text: Keeping his eyes on that church, he crutches his way across
text: the square - aiming for Lesner's barn... as:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - BASEMENT/LAB - SAME
text: Boyce awakens in this huge space. Looks around, disoriented.
text: He's on an OPERATING TABLE - his hands and feet tied to its
text: legs. A nearby SURGICAL TRAY bears a SCALPEL and SYRINGES.
text: Around him are the Villager-Creatures, tied to their beds,
text: black tar being pumped through their veins by Autojectors--
text: .+-black blood draining from them into bottles on the floor.
text: Bed #3 remains toppled over, its patient still tied to it.
text: The 25 GERMANS remain on their granite slabs across the lab.
text: The GAS STOVE is on again, black blood boiling in a vial.
text: Rosenfeld's bed is beside Boyce's. Their eyes meet. Then, a
text: BANGING SOUND. Boyce turns:
text: It's Bruel, using a MALLET to crush TWO US-ARMY DETONATORS.
text: Shit. Bruel drops the mallet and turns, twitching slightly -
text: his eyes on Boyce... Then Bruel grabs a SYRINGE.
text: Boyce braces himself. Bruel finds a VEIN in Boyce's arm. In
text: goes the needle... Bruel drawing blood, as:
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: So, Private. Why are you here?
text: Their eyes meet. Bruel's English is surprisingly unaccented.
speaker_heading: BRUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's the invasion - and yet you're
dialog: sent to this tiny village. Why? This
dialog: was a mission?
dialog: (Boyce is silent)
dialog: You were obviously intending to blow
dialog: up something, Private; we found four
dialog: blocks of tetrytol on one of your
dialog: fellow soldiers - and you and your
dialog: Hebrew friend here were carrying
dialog: detonators. What was your target?
text: Again, no reply. Bruel produces the SS DEATH'S-HEAD DAGGER
text: that Boyce found on the ramp, eyeing it fondly. Shit.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: BRUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: The tower on the roof? Was that it?
dialog: (Boyce is silent)
dialog: Was it something else?
text: Boyce just stares. We DRIFT DOWN to find his right wrist,
text: tied to that table-leg. There's a tiny bit of play in the
text: knot. So Boyce wiggles it, as invisibly as possible, while:
speaker_heading: BRUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Were you perhaps sent to target me?
dialog: This lab?
text: He studies Boyce for a reaction. None. Then he grabs a
text: CRANIOMETER (standard German phrenology instrument), and
text: begins to measure Boyce's skull with it, as:
speaker_heading: BRUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you come from Nordic stock by any
dialog: chance? Parents? Grandparents? Anyone
dialog: in your bloodline Teutonic? We're
dialog: always looking for candidates for our
dialog: re-Germanization program.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: (re: Villager-Creatures)
dialog: Are they being re-Germanized too?
text: At last, a response. Bruel breathes out a grin.
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: They are contributing to the war
dialog: effort in ways you could hardly
dialog: imagine.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: I'll ask the questions, if you don't
dialog: mind.
text: He tears Boyce's t-shirt away, lights his cigarette lighter.
speaker_heading: BRUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Again. Why are you here?
text: He puts the blade of the SS dagger into the flame.
text: The DAGGER glows red. Boyce tries not to react. Impossible.
speaker_heading: BRUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It won't hurt, you know - telling me.
dialog: But this...
dialog: 68.
text: Boyce prays for strength. Bruel grabs the CROSS hanging
text: around Boyce's neck and YANKS IT FREE, tossing it away.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Why're you doing this? You're French.
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: Am I?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: S'posed to be a doctor.
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: I am a soldier now! Ensuring the
dialog: Thousand-Year Reich! Himmler's dug up
dialog: half of Europe looking for the secret
dialog: - and I've found it for him!
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Secret to what?
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: History.
text: He PRESSES THE RED-HOT BLADE FLAT ONTO BOYCE'S BELLY. Boyce
text: howls - the pain unimaginable...
speaker_heading: BRUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: WHAT WERE YOUR ORDERS!? WHAT WERE YOU
dialog: TOLD ABOUT MY WORK HERE! ?
text: Boyce keeps praying, but Bruel does it again, red-hot steel
text: onto bare flesh. Rosenfeld cringing at the sight...
speaker_heading: BRUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: WHY ARE YOU HERE????
dialog: (Boyce crying)
dialog: I'VE WON THE WAR FOR THEM, YOU
text: UNDERSTAND? MY WORK! MY DISCOVERY!
dialog: AND YOU WILL NOT TAKE THAT FROM ME!
dialog: WHY ARE YOU HERE?!?!
text: Boyce in sheer agony, aching, crying... but he isn't talking.
text: Behind Bruel, that POT BOILS OVER. He turns, irritated, then
text: hurries toward it - giving Boyce a brief reprieve.
text: At the stove, Bruel pulls the vial of black BLOOD from the
text: boiling water. Then draws the blood into a SYRINGE.
text: Ten feet away, Boyce begins to work the rope again. Urgently.
text: Bruel, his syringe full now, turns.
dialog: 69.
text: Boyce moans loudly, as if delirious with pain.
text: Bruel, pleased, carries the syringe - not toward Boyce but
text: instead toward one of those dead Boxer-Wearers on the slabs;
dialog: this guy's name is/was SCHERZER.
text: Boyce goes back to work, struggling to loosen the rope, as:
text: Bruel injects the hot blood into Scherzer's HEART.
text: Boyce keeps working on the rope... Almost there...
text: Bruel finishes the injection on Scherzer. Turns.
text: ..-Boyce's hand isn't free yet. Rosenfeld sees that, so:
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: Water...
text: Bruel pauses as if he'd misheard.
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
speaker_heading: WATER.
text: Bruel approaches Rosenfeld. Mutual, utter contempt.
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: Just like a Jew, demanding that to
dialog: which you have no claim.
text: .+-which allows Boyce to keep working his wrist urgently, as:
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: Water. S'il vous plait.
text: Bruel backhands Rosenfeld across the face - just as Boyce's
text: hand_comes free. Rosenfeld keeps at it:
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, wine then. A nice French
dialog: Bordeaux maybe--
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: Silence!
text: Bruel slugs him, hard - then turns to face Boyce... who
text: continues to writhe as if delirious.
text: Bruel stands over him... and draws that SS DAGGER again.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: BRUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Smile, Private. There's no greater
dialog: honor than dying for your country.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: ‘Least I have one.
text: .+-which is when Bruel notices an oddity - something's
text: missing from the surgical tray - one ITEM, gone.
dialog: 
text: --but just as Bruel realizes it, BOYCE STRIKES in a BLUR -
text: JAMMING THAT SCALPEL into Bruel's neck. Bruel falls, gasping.
text: Boyce frees his other hand. Sits up, frees his legs, grabs
text: his RIFLE and fires a bullet into Bruel's chest.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you walk, Rosenfeld?
text: Rosenfeld shakes his head. Shit. There isn't much time.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/INT. LESNER BARN - RESUMING
text: Ford enters the LESNER BARN. There's her TRUCK. He advances-—
text: .-.-and is immediately CLUBBED FROM BEHIND by a SHOVEL. He
text: staggers, falls, turns...
text: Evy Lesner stands here, gruesome face and all. She grabs
text: Ford's RIFLE, points it at him.
text: --IN THE LAB - Boyce hurries to the LAST CABINET in a row.
text: It's locked. He knocks the lock off with his rifle-butt.
text: Inside, the four Tetrytol blocks. He grabs them, turns.
text: On that STOVE: vials, more SYRINGES. He heads over--
text: --BACK TO THE BARN - Ford struggles to his feet, supported by
text: that crutch. Lesner, rifle ready, hisses at him in French--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Listen, Lady, I don't speak much
dialog: French. Why don't you put that thing
dialog: down before somebody gets hurt?
dialog: (Lesner is unmoved)
dialog: Friends, okay? Amie?
text: Lesner eyes him with contempt. He reaches into his pocket.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Chocolate?
text: He offers his spare BAR of it to her. She lowers the rifle.
dialog: 71.
text: Then she FIRES IT - right into Ford's bad ankle.
text: BACK TO BOYCE - At the stove. He hears the shot; it snaps his
text: head around.
text: BACK TO FORD - He drops to the ground, his leg a rag-doll.
text: BACK TO BOYCE - panicked, he runs to Rosenfeld.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: That could be Lew! We gotta go!
text: Rosenfeld can't move. Boyce grabs him in a FIREMAN'S CARRY,
text: and heads out, moving right past those GRANITE SLABS.
text: On SLAB #1 is Scherzer, recipient of the hot-blood injection.
dialog: He just blinked.
text: BACK TO FORD - on his back. Lesner drifts over, reaches for
text: his TRENCH-KNIFE, taking her eyes off Ford for just a second--
text: Big mistake. He grabs her hair and yanks her to the ground...
text: That fast it's an ugly, feral wrestling match. Her BLACKENED
text: FINGERS clawing at him. Hair is grabbed, faces gouged. He
text: loosens her grip on the rifle and tosses it away... as:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - KITCHEN - SAME
text: Boyce carries Rosenfeld through. Up ahead is the BACK DOOR
text: that he blew open with that grenade. He heads toward it...
text: BACK TO THE BARN - Ford and Lesner struggle on the floor like
text: animals. Gouging, scratching, smothering, gasping...
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. BEHIND THE CHURCH - YARD - SAME
text: Boyce crosses the grounds, bearing Rosenfeld.
text: BACK TO THE BARN - A primal struggle. Lesner rolls on top of
text: Ford, her hand under his chin, trying to snap his neck.
text: Ford's trying to snap hers. Both of them panting.
text: Eyes locked, the sounds guttural. He's stronger, but she's
text: got leverage on her side - gravity too. She growls as--
dialog: .-+-a Single liquid SNAP...
text: And Lesner's body sags on top of Ford's. Neck broken.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. CHURCH - FRONT GATE - SAME
text: Boyce heads down the foothill, carrying Rosenfeld.
dialog: 72.
text: BACK TO THE BARN - Ford pushes Lesner's twisted body away. It
text: tumbles off of him like a mannequin. He tears her SHIRT off
dialog: to tourniquet his gushing leg, as we:
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. CIELBLANC - TOWN SQUARE - SAME
text: Boyce reaches the square, unaware that Ford's in the barn.
text: BACK TO FORD - He crawls to his CRUTCH, gets to his feet,
text: gathers his rifle, then to the barn door - in time to see:
text: --BOYCE, lugging Rosenfeld into the Laurent home.
text: BACK TO FORD - He hears a NOISE behind him - turns... and his
text: jaw drops - utter shock and horror.
text: ...as Lesner's body starts decaying, right before his eyes.
text: Her SKIN-BLISTERS begin to BUBBLE, as if CORRODING from the
text: inside. A SOUND comes from her, like a hissed death-rattle,
text: spitting out of her lungs. The CORROSION continues-—-
text: ..-eating not just her face now but every inch of her legs,
text: her torso, her neck - they all decay, with Ford bearing
text: witness - a sizzling sound as the flesh gives way...
text: Soon she looks like a piece of burned paper. Then she's mere
dialog: ASH inside clothing...
text: Ford is awed, afraid. But he swallows it all.
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - GREAT ROOM - CONTINUING
text: Boyce enters, lays Rosenfeld across the Dining Table.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Lew!? Lew!?
text: No reply from the attic. But Chloe emerges from her room:
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: This man needs help!
text: She nods. He hurries to the attic steps:
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lew?! Lew?!
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: He went out - to help you!
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: What?!
dialog: 73.
scene_heading: EXT. CIELBLANC - TOWN SQUARE - SAME (MORNING)
text: Ford hobbles through the empty Square, to the Laurent home.
text: The sounds of D-DAY thumping in the distance...
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - GREAT ROOM - RESUMING
text: Boyce moves to the door, adrenaline rocketing through him.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Lew?!
text: He throws it open, just as Ford hobbles in. Instant relief:
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank God. You don't-- Christ, what
dialog: happened to your leg?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I got shot--
dialog: (at Chloe)
dialog: --your friend with the truck. Then
text: she turned to ash. Was something
dialog: wrong with the ordnance?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Whaddaya mean she turned to ash--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I mean she shriveled up like a piece
text: of burnt confetti.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I don't--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Yes or no? Was something wrong with
dialog: the ordnance?
dialog: 
text: They study one another, Ford all-business.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: No. Nothin' wrong with it.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Then why's that tower still standing?
dialog: That sounded angry. Truth is, Ford's just reeling.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I... I heard the gunfire, thought you
dialog: might be in trouble.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: For the last time, it doesn't fucking
dialog: matter if I'm in trouble! The mission
dialog: is the tower! When're ya gonna get it
dialog: through that hayseed head of yours?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: That hurt, but Boyce doesn't fire back. He can't. Instead he
text: just heads up the attic steps.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Got a couple questions for our
dialog: prisoner.
speaker_heading: FORD
text: It's 8:25 already.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I know what time it is.
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - ATTIC - CONTINUING
text: Boyce arrives, pulls out the SYRINGE he took from the lab -
text: and a vial of BLACK BLOOD. He thrusts them at Wafner.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: What does this stuff do?
dialog: (Wafner's silent)
dialog: That doctor said it was gonna ensure
dialog: the Thousand-Year Reich. What was he
dialog: talking about?
text: Again, no reply. Boyce, rattled, puts a GUN to his head.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: You've got one minute. TALK.
text: Pretty aggressive move. Ford and Chloe appear at the top of
text: the steps. They haven't seen this side of Boyce before.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the black blood for?
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: You saw it. Don't you know?
text: Yes, Boyce knows - but he's silent. Wafner grins...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What's he talking about, Ed?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I dunno; they got a dozen villagers
dialog: in there - like her grandma, but
text: worse - tied up, bleeding into
text: bottles. The doctor injected some of
dialog: the blood into a...
dialog: (reluctantly...)
dialog: ...dead guy.
text: Wafner smiles a knowing smile. Ford eyes him..
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Why would he do that?
dialog: Wafner enjoying every second of this--
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: You want a Thousand-Year Reich, you
dialog: need a Thousand-Year Army. You see?
text: That lands with a THUD. Boyce and Ford silent...
text: A beat... trying to digest the idea. It goes down hard...
speaker_heading: WAFNER (CONT'D)
dialog: It's been there for ages, you know.
dialog: The tar. Ask her, she'll tell you.
dialog: All we did was dig it up...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (at Chloe)
dialog: You knew all this?
text: All eyes on Chloe. She looks as lost as they are...
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: (dazed...)
dialog: We heard stories about it, my whole
text: life. The black river under the hill.
dialog: But they were just stories...
text: Silence - Ford and Boyce still processing all this...
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: Credit that doctor - there were so
dialog: many failed attempts before he
dialog: learned how to use it, but he's
dialog: tireless. If his countryman had
dialog: worked half as hard to defend France,
dialog: we wouldn't be here today.
text: Boyce shakes his head. Ford just smoldering...
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: It can't be.
speaker_heading: WAFNER
text: Think of it. An inexhaustible army.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: It can't be.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: There's a way to find out.
text: Huh? Ford grabs his TRENCH-KNIFE and approaches Wafner.
text: ...-whose smile suddenly VANISHES - just realized: This guy's
text: about to kill me! He's right. Ford hobbles past Chloe, as--
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: But I told you everything!
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Hold it, Lew. What're you doing?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Playing doctor.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Why? Let's just blow up the tower and-
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Need to know what we're up against.
dialog: (at Wafner)
dialog: Don't we.
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: I don't-- I'm just a soldier!
dialog: (Ford about to strike)
dialog: NEIN!!!
text: THWUMP! Ford jams the dagger deep into Wafner's CHEST.
text: Silence hangs. Boyce can't fucking believe it.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Now you're an experiment.
text: Wafner's not breathing. Chloe and Boyce shocked--
text: Ford puts his head to Wafner's chest. Wafner's dead. Ford
text: reaches for the SYRINGE. Boyce hands it over, speechless, as:
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: "Fire at Germans," remember?
dialog: 77.
text: He fills it with BLACK BLOOD from the vial. Boyce dazed:
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: .»+-goes in his heart.
text: Ford jams it into Wafner's heart, hits the plunger... and
text: nothing happens. A long beat. Wafner's just dead...
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: We killing P.O.W.'s now?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You don't think the Nazis've killed
dialog: any P.O.W.'s?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Sure. That's what makes ‘em Nazis.
dialog: But we aren't like them, right?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Nobody ever won a war by saying
dialog: please and thank you, Ed. He knew
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Meanwhile it didn't get us anywhere.
dialog: Look at him.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I'm lookin'. My opinion, it's an
dialog: improvement.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Point is, we don't do this.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: We do now.
dialog: (studying Wafner...)
dialog: Dose mighta been too small--
text: Then a SHOCK: WAFNER'S EYES FLY OPEN. HIS HEAD POPS UP. HIS
text: CHEST EXPANDS. The blood from his wounds suddenly BLACK--
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: NEIN!!!
text: He just RE-SET TO THE EXACT MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS KILLED.
text: Otherwise, he's okay. Breathing. Alive.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Lew...?
text: Boyce and Ford stare at each other in silence, awestruck.
text: Ford - first time ever - doesn't know what to say. Chloe too.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lew...?
text: Ford just shakes his head...
text: ...as Wafner sees the KNIFE in his chest, the BLACK BLOOD
text: around it... and the syringe in Ford's hand.
text: And an awful realization hits. I was dead. He eyes Ford--
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: You... killed me?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Listen, Pal--
text: Wafner YANKS A HAND FREE, pulls the dagger from his chest,
text: cuts his ROPES LOOSE - and RISES, his eyes murderous.
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: You killed me.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Well, yeah, but in all fairness I
dialog: also brought you back. Now sit down.
dialog: (Wafner doesn't)
dialog: I said SIDDOWN, Asshole.
text: Every part of Boyce tensing. Wafner turns to them--
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: You see now? A Thousand-Year Army for
dialog: a Thousand-Year Reich!
text: ...as Wafner starts toward Ford--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Listen, Pal - I wasn't that crazy
dialog: about you the FIRST time around;
dialog: don't make me kill you again.
text: Wafner smiles... then charges Ford - pushing Chloe aside--
text: In a blur, Ford fires at him - BANG, in the arm.
text: Great... except Wafner keeps coming. Unaffected. Unharmed.
text: And the BLOOD spurting from his arm is now as BLACK AS PITCH.
dialog: 
text: Huh? Chloe screams. Boyce looks to Ford.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Lew!
dialog: 79.
text: Ford FIRES AGAIN. Hits Wafner in the CHEST. More BLACK BLOOD.
text: And STILL NO EFFECT - Wafner just as shocked by all this as
text: they are. Boyce swings that CHAIR at Wafner, striking him
text: over the head with it. It shatters. Again, he's unaffected.
text: So Ford SHOOTS HIM IN THE HEAD. That oughtta do it...
text: But the wound bleeds BLACK. And Wafner, after a pause, shakes
text: it off and keeps coming. Somehow.
text: He starts RANTING now, in German. We don't understand a word
text: of it but it sounds like something from a nazi rally.
text: Boyce, dazed, looks at that SYRINGE on the floor... and he
text: and Ford both come to the same horrible conclusion:
dialog: They've just turned this German into something unkillable.
text: And what he wants... is Chloe. In an ugly way. He grabs her,
text: throws her over his shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Chloe!
text: Boyce jumps in Wafner's path, tries to pull Chloe away--
text: Wafner BULLS FORWARD, using Chloe like shoulder-pads, into
text: Boyce. And there's nothing behind Boyce but those STAIRS.
text: Boyce goes flying - tumbling - landing hard at the base of
text: the attic steps.
text: Ford gets to his feet. Wafner kicks him, knocking him down.
text: .+-and carries Chloe down those steps. She's shrieking,
text: "MAMA!!!" And grabbing at the railing on each side of her,
text: trying to slow him down. Can't be done.
text: Ford scrambles to get another clean shot - his eyes meeting
text: Chloe. He can't fire again without hitting her.
scene_heading: INT. LAURENT HOME - GREAT ROOM - CONTINUING
text: Boyce, at the base of the steps, sees Wafner coming, draws
text: his SIDE-ARM, fires THREE SHOTS into Wafner's belly.
text: BLACK BLOOD oozes from Wafner's gut. A mere annoyance. He
text: steps OVER Boyce, heading for the door. Chloe screaming.
text: Rosenfeld reaches for a sidearm - but doesn't have one.
text: The rest of Chloe's family emerges now - to see Wafner head
text: for the door. Chloe screaming. Boyce gets to his feet.
dialog: 80.
text: --Ford thumping his way down the stairs--
text: Wafner reaches the door, opens it. An insane moment. He
text: carries her away, Chloe screaming:
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: MAMAI!!!!
scene_heading: MARIE-ELENA/PAUL
dialog: Chloe!!!
text: Into the Square, her voice ringing in our ears, sheer terror.
text: Ford hits the last step - but too late - Chloe's family in
text: tatters, her SCREAMS still audible. Then:
text: CRASH - a German grenade (called a "POTATO-MASHER") is tossed
text: by Wafner through the window.
text: Boyce scrambles for it--
text: --as Ford dives on top of Paul.
text: --and Rosenfeld hits the deck.
text: Boyce tosses it out of the room - it EXPLODES - loud.
text: Destructive. But no one's hit.
text: Boyce rushes to the window. Wafner is halfway up the hill.
text: And here we are, in a house that's seen a grenade explosion
text: and an abduction. Pure shock. Boyce and Ford trade a look.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You got the charges?
dialog: (Boyce half-nods...)
dialog: Let's go. It's time to take out our
dialog: Goddamn target and get Chloe the hell
dialog: outta there.
speaker_heading: ROSENFELD
dialog: What're you gonna use for a
dialog: detonator?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Whaddaya mean?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
text: The Doctor bashed both of ‘em in.
dialog: Ford considers that... Then:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I can get us a detonator.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Let's go. Still got thirty minutes
text: before our planes are in the air.
text: D-Day pounding. They head for the door, Ford on his crutch...
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: On one leg?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: It's the mission, ain't it?
text: That had some edge. He nears the door. Boyce follows...
speaker_heading: MARIE-ELENA
dialog: You help my daughter!
scene_heading: EXT. PASTURE - BEHIND CIELBLANC - MOMENTS LATER
text: Boyce and Ford emerge from behind a barn. They're just about
text: to approach the PASTURE - when Boyce STOPS Ford.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Mines. Watch your step.
text: Ford nods, thanks. We CRANE UP, Boyce leading a hobbled Ford
text: through this mine-ridden PASTURE, toward that foothill...
text: The church sits atop it. The guns of D-Day pounding. Then:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - EARTHEN RAMP - MOMENTS LATER
text: Boyce and Ford stand where Boyce stood last night: at the top
text: of the EARTHEN RAMP leading into the FOOTHILL itself. The
text: BLAST-DOORS are open. Boyce eyes them...
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Listen, I don't know what's down
dialog: there. Could be more of ‘em, could be
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Piece 'a cake.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Right. And half the German grenades
dialog: are duds. We don't know how to kill
dialog: these things, Lew...
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Keep it down. They might catch wise.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Yeah, then we'd really be in trouble.
text: Ford grins, about to march - when Boyce gags involuntarily -
text: just barely stopped himself from vomiting. Ford eyes him.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry. Shit.
dialog: (a beat...)
dialog: Don't you ever get scared?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: ‘Course. Everybody does. Know what
dialog: scares me worse? Some guy on Omaha
dialog: Beach buyin' it 'cause I didn't get
dialog: my job done. Rather die right here.
dialog: Wouldn't you?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I'm not so sure we're put together
dialog: the same way. My old man wouldn't've
text: run into a burning building to save
dialog: five strangers. I don't think I would
dialog: either.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Hey, forget what my old man did. It's
dialog: too much to live up to, believe me.
text: That came out before Ford could stop it. Now it hovers...
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT’D)
dialog: Screw this. It's D-Day. Let's go.
text: They descend down the ramp, toward DARKNESS.
text: ...crossing under the ANCIENT RUNIC SYMBOLS and the SWASTIKA.
text: One last look at the symbols, wondering what they mean. Then
text: Ford and Boyce vanish into the pitch of the Cavern...
scene_heading: INT. CAVERN UNDER THE CHURCH —- CONTINUING
text: It's big. First thing we see down here is a burned-out TRUCK,
dialog: the one that carried in all those German bodies.
text: Beside it we find TWO CHARRED CORPSES. It's hard to say for
dialog: sure, but one of them looks it was once a German soldier. The
text: other looks like it might've been Penner. Gruesome.
text: Ford and Boyce move around a corner... to find:
dialog: 83.
text: A DERRICK, pumping something from a BIG HOLE IN THE GROUND.
text: A HOSE from the derrick is connected to a large BARREL, which
text: is OVERFLOWING with a thick black substance. Tar.
text: Trouble is, there's a GERMAN standing beside the derrick--
text: It's Scherzer, the guy who received the injection from Bruel.
text: Scherzer's still in his white boxers, his back to us, staring
text: down into the HOLE from which that derrick is pumping...
text: There's a GAPING WOUND across his back. Clearly, it's what
text: killed him. But he's alive now, the BLOOD from that wound a
dialog: calcified black. So how do we kill him???
text: Boyce and Ford trade a silent look. Boyce raises his rifle,
text: aiming... but Ford stops him with a silent headshake. There's
dialog: no point in trying to shoot this guy.
text: Then Ford sees it... affixed to a wall:
text: The FIRE HOSE. Boyce saw it used last night. Ford crutches
text: toward it. Boyce follows. The hose is coiled around a WHEEL.
text: Boyce starts to UNCOIL IT. It squeaks, LOUD. He stops.
text: Scherzer, twenty feet away, doesn't turn - just staring into
text: whatever is down there, obviously unsettled.
text: Ford moves to the FAUCET - a red knob. He indicates to Boyce,
dialog: "When I turn this knob, you start RUNNING TO UNCOIL THE
text: HOSE." Boyce nods.
text: A moment, their eyes locked, then--
text: FORD TURNS THE RED KNOB - loud and squeaky.
text: Scherzer turns at the sound--
text: Boyce starts running at him with the hose.
text: Scherzer reaching for his RIFLE.
text: Ford turning the knob harder - full blast.
text: The hose UNCOILING off the wheel as fast as Boyce can run.
text: WATER EXPLODING OUT OF THE NOZZLE - too hard - the burst
text: actually knocking Boyce off his feet.
text: Scherzer grabs the rifle, turns to fire, YELLING--
text: ++.asS Boyce gets to one knee, aiming the hose, and...
dialog: 84.
text: BAM - it hits Scherzer in the chest - just as he FIRES.
text: BANG - the bullet hitting a JUNCTION BOX a foot to Ford's
text: left. Instantly, the POWER GOES OUT.
text: And Scherzer is knocked off his feet, right into:
text: ...the HOLE IN THE GROUND beside the derrick. Gone.
text: A beat. Ford turns the water off. Boyce lowers the hose.
text: And they move in, cautiously, toward the edge of the hole.
text: Ford crutching his way there... Then he looks down to see--
text: .+.-a POOL OF BLACK GUNK below. Scherzer's HAND sticking out.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Now he knows what it tastes like.
text: A beat... Then Ford takes out his father's ZIPPO, lights
text: it... and holds the flame to that overflowing barrel.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: If it'll burn, we gotta burn it. I
dialog: wouldn't even want our side to know
dialog: what this stuff can do.
text: That fast, the TAR in the barrel IGNITES, highly flammable.
text: The flames dance across that HOSE, through the DERRICK, then
text: down into the hole just as--
text: JUMP-SCARE: Scherzer reaches up out of the tar - gasping.
text: But the tar-pool ignites - a MASSIVE WALL OF FLAME ERUPTING
text: FROM IT, knocking Boyce and Ford on their asses. The FLAMES
text: ROAR OUT... then suck back down again.
text: Boyce and Ford crawl to the hole, look down - the CHARRED
text: REMAINS OF SCHERZER seared into place among the flames.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT’D)
dialog: Guess they burn too.
text: Boyce rises, offers his hand - just like Ford pulled Boyce
text: onto that C-47 last night. Ford takes the hand, as--
text: A STAIRWELL DOOR OPENS, ten feet away. Here's Kiebel, another
dialog: guy we killed once before - checking on that JUNCTION BOX--
text: But he sees Boyce, and Ford, and the FIRE.
dialog: 85.
text: And he charges them - unarmed but roaring--
text: Boyce and Ford FIRE THEIR RIFLES out of instinct. It doesn't
text: make a dent. Black blood spurting from his wounds, Kiebel
text: barrels into them both.
text: Ford falls hard. Boyce and Kiebel tumble together to the
text: cavern floor, RIGHT BY THE SURGING FLAMES.
text: Kiebel's on top of Boyce in a hurry, hands around Boyce's
text: throat - trying to choke him out. Boyce can't stop him - the
text: Nazi is undead and way too strong. The heat is scorching...
text: Ford jumps on Kiebel's back, grabs Kiebel's head, pulling
text: hard as Boyce gasps for breath. Ford TUGS. We hear that same
text: single liquid SNAP we heard from Lesner when her neck broke.
text: ...except Kiebel doesn't stop. With his HEAD now dangling at
text: an unnatural angle, he keeps strangling Boyce.
text: Ford, no choice, SLITS KIEBEL'S THROAT... Now black blood
text: gushes from it onto Boyce.
text: And STILL KIEBEL DOESN'T STOP. He's a monster, literally -
text: his grip on Boyce's throat unrelenting. Barking in German.
text: Ford, no moves left, pulls out his SIDE-ARM and fires it
text: right into Kiebel's right WRIST. The bone shatters. Then the
text: LEFT WRIST. That bone shatters too.
text: His grip on Boyce loosens. Boyce sucks in a breath. Then one
text: huge burst of energy - pushing Kiebel away and--
text: ...toward the edge of that hole, into the FLAMES.
text: Kiebel's CLOTHES ignite. One MORE PUSH from Boyce and--
text: Kiebel vanishes down the hole, SCREECHING as he falls.
text: And it's over. Ford and Boyce eye one another - Boyce now
text: drenched in the black blood of a dead Nazi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
dialog: See? Simple.
text: Boyce, soaked in black, just eyes him--
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Stairs're over there.
speaker_heading: FORD
text: Twenty minutes.
text: Boyce nods. Ford follows him to the stairwell door.
dialog: 86.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
text: They climb in darkness (the LIGHT BULB in here now useless).
text: Ford struggling up the steps.
text: They reach the DOOR leading to the basement. Boyce nudges it
text: open with the tip of his rifle, revealing:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUING (DAY)
text: We were here before. But now none of the LIGHTS are working.
text: Rooms to our right and left. All dark now. Boyce is about to
dialog: step into the hallway when--
text: A FLASHLIGHT BEAM whips past his nose. He moves back.
text: ...to find Wafner hurrying past this door - heading AWAY from
text: the LAB. No sign of Chloe. Wafner vanishes down the hall...
text: Boyce follows. Ford stops him. And this is in WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: He's got Chloe.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Chloe ain't the mission.
text: That landed. Boyce nods... then:
text: They step into the dark HALLWAY, toward the LAB. Boyce nudges
text: open the door to the ARMORY - pointing it out to Ford.
text: Ford silently leans in, turns on his FLASHLIGHT--
text: Boyce alone in the hallway now, his head on a swivel--
text: Ford returns, bearing SIX GERMAN POTATO MASHERS. Gives three
text: to Boyce, pockets three for himself. They continue along--
text: ..+.to the LAB DOOR. Boyce nudges it open.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - BASEMENT/LAB - CONTINUING (DAY)
text: BLACK. Boyce and Ford stay low. Boyce shines his FLASHLIGHT
text: into the space - illuminating it for Ford in brief bursts:
text: The creature/villagers, tied to their beds. The autojectors.
text: The CONCRETE SLABS where those 25 DEAD GERMANS WERE--
text: Whoops. FIVE OF THE SLABS ARE UNOCCUPIED...
text: Boyce reacts, instantly shining his flashlight on the spot
text: where he left Bruel's BODY. Bruel isn't there anymore.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Got six unaccounted for--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Let's just get these charges set.
text: He heads for the back wall - Boyce watching.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
text: Lew. Tower's up on the roof.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Tower ain't enough anymore, Ed. This
dialog: whole place has to come down.
text: Boyce eyes the Villager-Subjects. Heads toward them--
text: Ford heads for the BACK WALL, passing by that SEVERED DOG-
text: HEAD, kept alive by the Autojector. He can't resist:
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT’D)
dialog: (at the dog-head)
dialog: Stay.
text: The head, of course, doesn't move.
text: Boyce begins to UNTIE THE CREATURE from Bed #1. A FEMALE, her
text: face completely blistered-black. Boyce frees her hands.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Go. Allez.
text: She doesn't move. Maybe she can't. Maybe she's deaf. He
text: unties her feet. Still no movement.
text: Ford, at the back wall, removes a TETRYTOL BLOCK from his
text: trousers, fixes it on the wall.
text: Boyce moves to BED #2. A male, equally gruesome. Boyce starts
text: to untie his wrists. The creature GROWLS like an animal.
text: Boyce recoils a bit, but he finishes, then moves on.
text: BED #3 is still toppled on its side, its tortured inhabitant
text: stuck there. Boyce moves nearer, untying the guy: a semi-
text: human nightmare under all that blistered flesh.
text: Then, disaster: the LAB-DOOR OPENS. Two GERMAN SOLDIERS burst
text: in. Boyce shuts his flashlight off. Ford too - but too late--
text: The GERMANS OPEN UP ON HIM, machine-gun fire.
text: Ford spins away, falling to the floor. The machine-gun fire
text: continues, the Germans HOLLERING at him. (They were on those
text: slabs an hour ago - dressed in their uniforms now).
dialog: 88.
text: Boyce drops - the Germans don't seem to know he's here.
text: They start moving in on Ford's position, firing continually.
text: He doesn't return fire. These guys are SCREAMING.
text: Boyce, on hands and knees, scrambles toward them. He pulls a
text: PIN on one of his POTATO MASHERS, slides it along the floor.
text: It blows up at the FEET of the Germans - but they DON'T STOP,
text: still firing at Ford, shouting.
text: Now what? Boyce looks around, sees something, crawls to it--
text: There, those CEREMONIAL AXES, affixed to the wall. He gets to
text: his feet, grabs one - the noise drowned out by the TORRENT of
text: machine-gun fire. It lights up a corner of the room.
text: Ford scrambling to get away. Germans shouting--
text: Boyce hurrying to a position behind the Germans now.
text: Ford trying to crawl, but they're right on top of him.
dialog: .-.-and they've just about spotted him, when--
text: THWACK - in the darkness - Boyce swinging that AXE, taking
text: THE HEAD OFF OF GERMAN SOLDIER #1. It bounces to the floor.
text: GERMAN SOLDIER #2 turns - THWACK - Boyce swings again,
text: hitting the guy's right wrist, severing the arm there. The
text: German's RIGHT HAND, still clutching the rifle, falls.
dialog: 
text: He grabs for his SIDE-ARM, cursing Boyce loudly in German.
text: Boyce takes another swing. THWOP - severing the guy's LEFT
text: HAND. Now this German is really angry - howling at Boyce.
text: Boyce moves in - the German unable to defend himself - Ford
text: watching in semi-shock from a corner...
text: One last swing. Boyce beheads him. Down he goes. Two headless
text: Nazis, side by side. Crisis over. Ford slightly awed by what
dialog: he just witnessed. A moment... then:
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: They teach that move in Basic? I
dialog: musta been sick that day.
dialog: Ford's way of saying, "Nice work." It mattered a lot.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Are you hit?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: No. Go find Chloe, get her out of
dialog: here. I'll set the charges.
text: Boyce nods, helps Ford to his feet--
text: As he does so, Ford slips something into Boyce's pocket,
text: Boyce entirely unaware.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT'D)
text: Ten minutes.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Then they notice: one of the two Nazi heads is still moving -
text: twitching really - if only slightly. Ford sighs, Jesus... and
text: brushes it aside. It bumps into a table leg.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Get going.
text: Boyce nods numbly, heads out. We STAY HERE WITH FORD--
text: ...-making sure Boyce is gone. Then Ford lifts up his shirt.
text: And we learn that he's been GUT-SHOT, bleeding badly. He sags
text: back, grabs his crutch, willing himself to the back wall.
text: ..-where he sets the last TETRYTOL BLOCKS then SPLICES their
text: four wires while checking his watch.
text: His gut continues to bleed. He ignores it, wrapping those
text: FOUR WIRES INTO ONE... then wrapping that ONE WIRE around the
text: terminal of a GRENADE...
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUING
text: Boyce emerges from the stairwell into the hallway, axe in
text: hand... Again, not a sound. No one here. He enters:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - GROUND FLOOR - SANCTUARY - CONTINUING
text: Rows of EMPTY PEWS. Boyce enters... Silence.
text: Then, a SOUND - the sobs of a girl - coming from somewhere
text: ABOVE him. Boyce turns, looks up:
text: A BALCONY. The voice seems to be coming from a LOGE BOX up
text: there. Yet we can't see Chloe.
text: .--but we can see Wafner, entering the loge box, talking in
text: German, a wicked smile on his face. Someone's at his feet,
text: out of our view. Wafner takes his belt off--
dialog: 90.
text: Boyce wants to shoot the guy from here but there's no point.
text: Instead, Boyce slinks across the sanctuary - to a set of
text: STAIRS that will lead to the balcony... We RETURN TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - BASEMENT/LAB - RESUMING
text: Ford piles up FLAMMABLES in the center of the lab: SHEETS,
text: etc., a big mound. He rips the NAZI FLAG off the wall, tosses
text: it on the pile. It's stained with his blood now.
text: He douses the pile with RUBBING ALCOHOL. But--
text: --hold it. We just saw a SHADOW drift across the floor.
dialog: Ford's unaware of it...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - SANCTUARY - BALCONY - SAME
text: Boyce reaches the Balcony. From here he can see--
text: Wafner, his back to us, unzipping his trousers... and Chloe,
text: flat on her back, handcuffed to a railing. Crying. Wafner
text: mocks her in German, unmoved by her cries for mercy.
dialog: Boyce moves in. This'll be easy; Wafner's a clean target.
text: Boyce drifts closer. Wafner beginning to lower himself on top
text: of Chloe - his voice continuing to pour German filth into her
text: ears. Chloe crying, begging him to stop.
text: Then she sees Boyce, standing over Wafner. Thank God. Boyce
text: lifts that AXE over his head. Wafner still unaware, when--
text: BANG - a shot fired from the SANCTUARY FLOOR below, knocking
text: the axe from Boyce's hand--
dialog: 
text: Then TWO MORE SHOTS -- Boyce HIT in the SHOULDER. He drops
text: down on his belly.
text: Wafner springs up now, half-dressed. Looks over the railing.
text: Kogan is down here, blasting away. Shouting at Wafner and
text: pointing: there's an AMERICAN five feet from you!
text: Now Wafner turns, sees Boyce. Wafner infuriated, coming at
text: him. The axe is out of Boyce's grasp, and his SHOULDER is
text: bleeding. Chloe terrified - Boyce too. Wafner five feet away.
speaker_heading: WAFNER
dialog: You should have left me dead.
dialog: Boyce has a SIDE-ARM, but what good is it? Here comes Wafner
text: unkillable and angry. Fuck. He's about to strike--
text: Then Boyce gets an idea. He FIRES at Wafner's left eye.
dialog: gl.
text: BINGO. Wafner one-eyed now. Boyce fires at his right eye.
text: BINGO. Wafner blinded now, cursing Boyce loudly. Boyce gets
text: to his feet. Wafner still coming. Boyce plows into the guy,
text: that SHOULDER screaming in pain. But Boyce keeps CHARGING--
text: ..-like a crazed linebacker, pile-driving the now-blind
text: Wafner over the balcony railing--
text: Down, down... Wafner lands hard on the Sanctuary floor. He's
text: still alive - but he's been neutralized for a moment.
text: Kogan hasn't. He starts FIRING at Boyce again.
text: Boyce drops down out of sight, a foot from Chloe. Their eyes
text: meeting. He pulls the pin on a GRENADE. Then a second one.
text: Tosses the first from his perch... then tosses the second.
text: They arc lazily on their way down toward Kogan - who SCREAMS
text: AT THEM. But just before they reach him--
text: BANG BANG. He fires - hitting them both in mid-air. TWO
text: INSTANTANEOUS EXPLOSIONS, tearing up a portion of his face
text: and ripping one of his hands off.
text: But it's not enough to kill or stop him. Dazed, he reaches
text: for his rifle, which he has to pry from his amputated hand.
dialog: 
text: BOYCE - IN THE BALCONY - knows he has to move fast.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Turn away.
text: Chloe turns her head. He swings the axe at the CHAIN cuffing
text: her wrist to the railing - just as Chloe squirms.
text: He misses her face by half an inch. Misses the CHAIN too.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: What're you moving for?!
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You just said turn away!
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Don't! Don't do anything!
text: She stiffens. He swings the axe. Her eyes squeezed SHUT.
text: With a SPARK, the chain breaks--
text: But just then - BANG BANG BANG -
dialog: 92.
text: Kogan firing up at them with his one remaining hand. Wafner
text: firing too although BLIND - bullets everywhere. Madness.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Follow me!
text: He grabs Chloe, pulls her along the railing, ducking gunfire.
text: All he's got is that AXE. She follows him into:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - HALLWAY - CONTINUING
text: With Wafner and Kogan still howling, firing--
text: ...-Boyce pulls Chloe toward the STAIRWELL DOOR. He tosses
text: another GRENADE over his shoulder. It skitters past them -—
text: A loud BOOM - ineffectual.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - BASEMENT/LAB - RESUMING
text: Ford has set the CHARGES and piled the FLAMMABLES. Now, weak
text: from blood loss, he eyes that GAS STOVE... and crosses to it.
text: just enough strength to get there, barely. He yanks its
text: MAIN LINE from the wall. Gas HISSING out now. He checks his
text: watch again, his back turned to the rest of the lab, then--
dialog: 
text: He staggers forward, finally losing consciousness - as:
text: ACROSS THE LAB - Bruel emerges from shadow. We RETURN TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - STAIRWELL - CONTINUING
text: Boyce and Chloe burst in, racing down the steps. A DOOR OPENS
text: one flight above them - Kogan leading the sightless Wafner
text: into this stairwell. STILL FIRING, shouting--
text: Boyce leads Chloe out of the stairwell into--
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - RESUMING
text: They emerge into the hallway, but - COMING AT THEM from 20
text: yards away - Mueller and Richt, reaching for their rifles--
text: Boyce and Chloe can't turn back - they've got Kogan and
text: Wafner behind them.
text: So we're TRAPPED. Mueller and Richt start FIRING. Boyce grabs
text: Chloe's hand, leads her into the first reachable DOOR:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMORY ROOM - CONTINUING
text: Boyce shuts the door, leaving us in DARKNESS. Turns on his
text: flashlight - illuminating all these RIFLES, useless to us.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: We're going to die...
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: No we're not.
text: He grabs one of those lockers, pushes it up against the door
text: as a barricade. Chloe holding up the flashlight for him.
text: THUDS come from the other side of the door - four undead
text: Nazis trying to get in. Chloe terrified. Boyce backing up
text: against the locker to hold it.
text: A BIGGER THUD - the door starting to give way. It jars the
text: locker enough for the LOCKER DOORS to swing open. Things
text: falling out now. The Nazis pounding away.
text: Boyce tries to hold them back... but all four of these
text: monsters are now pushing on that door.
text: More ITEMS fall from the locker now, landing at Boyce's feet.
text: One gets his attention - giving him an idea...
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stand back.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Stand back!
text: She moves to the corner. Boyce moves AWAY FROM THE LOCKER,
text: backing up against the wall, in darkness. He grabs the
text: flashlight from her, turns it off, as--
text: ONE LAST PUSH FROM THE NAZIS - the door bursts in.
text: The LOCKER falls to the ground, slamming at Boyce's feet.
text: And here they come - all four of them; Boyce has just let
dialog: them in. Here's why:
text: He now has PENNER'S FLAMETHROWER, the "Hitler Hunter"-—
text: And he opens up with it, a spray of FLAME, illuminating the
text: armory as it finds these four charging Nazis.
text: Kogan, Richt, Mueller, Wafner - all of them engulfed. The
text: heat unbearable. Chloe screaming. The Nazis shrieking,
text: hissing. Their RIFLES FIRING.
text: Kogan and Wafner drop and roll. Boyce douses them again.
dialog: 94.
text: Mueller staggers into a wall, then to the ground. Richt runs
text: down the hall, screeching.
text: Boyce grabs Chloe's hand, leads her out.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUING
text: Flame everywhere, the Nazis burning noisily. Boyce douses
dialog: Richt again. Richt drops. All good... until:
text: Here come TWO MORE NAZIS, emerging from the stairwell.
text: Boyce douses them. They catch fire... but we hear a CLICK.
text: Hitler Hunter is empty. And these guys aren't fully engulfed.
text: Boyce charges them with his BAYONET, drives it through both
text: of them, then uses it to plow them into that ARMORY. They're
text: burning too badly to defend themselves.
dialog: 
text: He tosses a GRENADE in there, shuts the door behind him.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Fire in the hole!
text: BOOM - a HUGE EXPLOSION from inside the armory sends the door
text: rocketing out at us. But it did the job.
text: He eyes Chloe - roasting bodies smoking all around them.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get out of here. Now!
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I want to help you--
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Chloe, we're blowing this whole place
dialog: up! Go!
text: End of argument. She turns to go. He opens the lab-door...
text: And a SHOCK suddenly appears at his feet--
text: It's that CREATURE/VILLAGER from Bed #3. Poor bastard must
dialog: have dragged himself all the way to this door. Now he lies
text: here, spent, barely alive, barely human.
text: And Chloe just stares, speechless. She's never seen anything
text: like this guy before - every inch of him diseased and black.
text: Worse, his crazed eyes seem to be staring right at her... as:
text: Her jaw drops, just saw something IMPOSSIBLE. She SCREAMS.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go home.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I can't!
dialog: (suddenly unraveling)
dialog: It's my father...
text: Boyce pauses - maybe he heard wrong. Nope, that's what she
text: said. He studies the face of the creature at their feet...
dialog: and he sees it. This, once, was Alain Laurent.
text: Chloe devastated, horrified, grateful - all at once.
speaker_heading: CHLOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Papa?!
text: Just then, a NOISE IN THE LAB reminds Boyce of his duty. He
text: bends down, grabs the Alain-Creature by the arms, drags him
text: out of the doorway, as:
speaker_heading: CHLOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Papa?!
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: You can't help him, Chloe. Just get
dialog: as far away from here as you can.
text: She doesn't reply - and he doesn't have time to argue. He
text: disappears into the lab, closing the door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - BASEMENT/LAB - RESUMING
text: Boyce stands in DARKNESS. His instincts freeze him.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Flash.
text: There's no answer from the darkness. He tries again:
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Flash.
text: Again, no answer. Just a SOUND... a HISSING. Boyce turns on
text: his FLASHLIGHT, tracking the sound to:
text: That STOVE. Its main line sending GAS VAPOR into the air.
text: Boyce can smell it. Then his flashlight BEAM finds--
text: That pile of FLAMMABLES in the center of the room, sheets,
text: pillows, a Nazi flag, all doused with Rubbing Alcohol...
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Flash.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: FORD (0.S.)
dialog: Thunder.
text: Ford's VOICE, at last. Boyce whips the beam toward it--
text: ..-and he freezes, his blood just congealing--
text: Here's Ford - sitting on an exam table. BLACK BLOOD now
text: spilling from the wound on his BELLY.
dialog: 
text: Beside him is Dr. Bruel. Alive - a SYRINGE in his hand. He
text: drops it to the floor.
text: Boyce can't breathe. Or blink. Utterly stupified.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Lew?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Yeah?
text: Wait. That didn't sound like Ford; it had an ugliness to it.
text: He hops off that table and starts toward _us - walking on a
text: shattered ankle, impervious to pain.
text: And his RIFLE is slung, aimed right at us.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: What happened to you?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I died. Then I got better.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Whaddaya mean, you died?
text: Ford keeps coming. How is he walking on a shattered ankle?
text: Bruel, behind him, watches with a sadistic delight. Boyce
text: eyes the black blood on Ford's shirt - hoping he's wrong...
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: What'd he do to you, Lew?
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: I told you, Private - we make History
dialog: in this lab!
text: Ford keeps coming, no light in his eyes. It's like he's
text: turned into someone else - maybe just a darker version of
text: himself. But Boyce just can't, or won't, accept that yet.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Why so quiet, Ed? Ya scared?
dialog: 97.
text: Now it's official. Ford is not Ford anymore. Boyce reeling.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Listen, let's just blow this place to
dialog: Hell and get you to a medic, huh?
dialog: (Ford keeps coming)
dialog: Lew?
text: BANG. Ford fires at him. Just missing. Boyce spins away,
text: horrified, dropping the flashlight. DARKNESS now.
text: He stumbles back, knocks over a beaker. Ford FIRES at the
text: sound. BANG. A spark-missile in the blackness.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lew, it's me. Ed.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I know who you are. You're the little
dialog: sad-sack that hasn't left me alone
dialog: since the first day of Basic.
text: That hurt, but before Boyce can address it - BANG. ANOTHER
text: SHOT. Boyce diving out of the way. His own personal Hell - a
text: hateful Ford trying to kill him.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Listen to me - this is not you. Your
dialog: name is Lewis Ford. You're from
text: Brooklyn. Corporal in the US Army.
dialog: Put the rifle down, awright?
text: BANG. Up ahead, a SECOND DOOR. Boyce moving toward it. He
text: gets to the door. IT'S LOCKED. Won't budge. BANG. Another
text: shot, this one nicking his hand.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Your old man painted houses. Your
dialog: ma's afraid of heights...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: My memory's fine, Ed.
text: BANG. Another shot, this one grazing Boyce's ear.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Lew, don't!
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Sorry. You know that TEMPER of mine.
text: Ford, a foot away, pulls the trigger again. CLICK. Out of
text: ammo. Annoyed, he tosses the rifle... but he keeps coming...
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: This is NOT you!
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: It's me.
text: Boyce backing away. Ford bearing down. GAS hissing from the
text: stove. Boyce holds his rifle like an OAR, ready to strike--
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Don't make me do this, Lew. Don't
dialog: make me do this--
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (keeps coming)
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Goddammit!
text: He butt-ends Ford across the jaw with his rifle. It scrambles
text: the wires in Ford's brain enough to slow him for a second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lew - please...
text: But Ford keeps coming. Boyce BASHES HIM again - this time
text: breaking Ford's JAW. Black blood spurting--
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: You're wasting your time, Private!
dialog: You can't stop him!
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: THIS IS NOT YOU! You're a US soldier!
text: Ford keeps coming. Boyce, crying now, bashes him again - this
text: time breaking Ford's orbital bone...
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: The key to the whole war - and it was
dialog: won with FRENCH BLOOD! Wait 'til they
dialog: hear that in Berlin!
text: Still, Ford doesn't stop. Boyce swings that rifle like a
text: BASEBALL BAT - right into the side of Ford's skull. CRACK.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: That who you wanna be, Lew? The guy
dialog: who wins the war for the Nazis?
text: Ford grins, black blood on his teeth, his jaw now set at an
text: unnatural angle - completely gruesome.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: What about the guys on Omaha Beach?
dialog: We had a MISSION, remember?
text: They reach that MOUND OF FLAMMABLES now, not far from the GAS-
text: HISSING STOVE. Their eyes locked.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: We're supposed to destroy this place.
dialog: The radio-jamming tower! By nine...
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: You wanna complete the mission?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Ford nods calmly... then bends down, grabs something off that
text: pile of alcohol-soaked flammables, and holds it out to Boyce:
text: His GRENADE... wired to the DET-CORDS of the TETRYTOL BLOCKS.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Then pull the pin.
dialog: Hold it. Time just stopped.
text: Bruel drifts over, amused... The hissing of that leaking GAS
text: suddenly sounds THUNDEROUS. Ford's smile is creepy as hell,
text: his teeth cracked and blackened. And Boyce is speechless.
text: He can complete the mission - but it'll cost him his life.
speaker_heading: FORD (CONT’D)
dialog: Well? What'll it be, Soldier? God and
dialog: Country... or Cowardice?
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: This is not you, Lew.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I knew you wouldn't have the guts.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: This is not you!
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: PULL THE PIN, YOU COWARD!
text: Their eyes lock. Madness around them. Bruel starts to
dialog: chuckle... And Boyce decides--
text: He pulls the pin.
dialog: 100.
text: Then holds it up defiantly for Ford to see. This is it.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: We stick together, right?
text: Ford's surprised, impressed. Bruel is terrified. He starts to
text: run away.
text: Ford grabs Bruel by the collar, preventing him from leaving.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: It's your party too, Doc.
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: Not!!!
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Siddown!
text: Ford throws him to the ground, puts a boot on Bruel's chest.
text: +..as the seconds tick down. Boyce not running - not even
text: shutting his eyes.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Goodbye, Lew.
dialog: They're going to die. Right now. 3, 2, l...
text: .--but nothing happens. No explosion. Boyce deeply thrown...
dialog: The grenade was a fucking DUD.
text: Bruel opens his eyes, surprised as hell. Boyce's eyes never
text: stray from Ford, who looks completely confused.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Like you said. German grenades.
text: No reply. Then, above them, a loud TICK. They look up--
text: It's a CLOCK - just struck 9 A.M.
text: That, somehow, got Ford's attention. Boyce can see it.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nine o'clock, remember? D-Day.
text: And something CLICKS in the back of Ford's brain. A memory, a
dialog: flicker of the human being he used to be, just minutes ago--
text: He reaches into a pocket, removes his father's charred Zippo.
text: Boyce reacts - his eyes going wide - but:
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Go.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (top of his lungs)
dialog: GET OUT OF HERE!!!
text: Ford flicks open the lighter. All he has to do is spark it
dialog: and this entire LAB will blow. That GAS hissing...
text: Boyce takes off, heading for the door.
text: Bruel gets the idea.
speaker_heading: BRUEL
dialog: No!
text: Ford puts his boot on Bruel's THROAT now...
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - RESUMING
text: Boyce, in a dead sprint, races into that STAIRWELL.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - STAIRWELL - CONTINUING
text: He enters, finds Chloe trying to drag the near-lifeless body
text: of her father up the stairs. Boyce dives on them both, to
dialog: shelter them, as:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - BASEMENT/LAB - RESUMING
text: Ford eyes that Zippo... Then:
text: He SPARKS IT UP - one little charge in all this GAS, and--
text: BOOOOOOM! A MASSIVE EXPLOSION knocks us sideways. The air
text: itself seems to RIP IN HALF. All those CHARGES DETONATING.
dialog: 
text: FIRE EVERYWHERE, Ford and Bruel and all the tortured
text: villagers instantly eviscerated, the WALLS CRACKING, as:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
text: Fire ROARS into the hallway, WALLS FAILING here too.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - STAIRWELL - SAME
text: It's like a massive EARTHQUAKE in here. Boyce trying to
text: shelter Chloe and her father.
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - SANCTUARY - SAME
text: The FLOOR BUCKLES - this Sanctuary caving in.
scene_heading: INT. CAVERN UNDER THE CHURCH - SAME
text: The ceiling above us craters, rock and cement coming down
text: like a waterfall, ONTO THE FLAMING DERRICK, crushing it--
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH ROOF - SAME
text: The RADIO-JAMMING TOWER collapses in a heap...
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - BASEMENT/RUINS - RESUMING
text: Half of the Sanctuary collapses into this lab. The church
text: barely standing. The fire doused by the sheer volume of dust
text: and debris. It's all a BLUR, over in mere SECONDS...
dialog: 
text: Then... SILENCE. Just rubble and smoke and dust...
text: We drift through it. Concrete slabs turned over. Operating
text: tables twisted in half, CHURCH PEWS upended.
text: .».-and a lonely, charred Zippo. Then:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - STAIRWELL - RESUMING
text: Rubble, stone, steel, dust. Beneath the pile we find BOYCE,
text: face down. He isn't moving. We DRIFT IN ON HIM, and...
text: FADE TO BLACK...
text: ...over which, the sound of AIRPLANES. Lots of them.
text: Fighters, bombers, an armada. Then we FADE UP again, on:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LESNER BARN - DUSK
text: Boyce awakens, his ears filling with all that sound. He looks
text: around. Nine hours have passed. He's in the LESNER BARN--
text: ..-which has now become a FIELD HOSPITAL. Around him, on
text: cots, lie SEVEN WOUNDED SOLDIERS. We see I.V.'s, DOCTORS, the
text: works. Lesner's TRUCK has been moved out.
text: And the U.S. Army, clearly, has moved in.
text: Boyce is shirtless. His shoulder's been bandaged, the burns
text: on his abdomen field-dressed. He sits up, slowly...
text: Rosenfeld lies on a nearby cot. Grunauer is tending to him.
text: But there's no Ford, of course. And no Chloe. Boyce rises.
dialog: 103.
text: First few seconds on his feet are pretty wobbly. His knees
text: want to give way, but he makes them stiffen. And everyone
text: around here is too preoccupied to notice.
text: He takes a first halting step for the barn door - then
text: notices something to his right, a STANDING CURTAIN,
text: partitioning off one patient from the rest.
text: He hears a familiar voice behind it. Marie-Elena. Boyce moves
text: to the curtain. Grunauer notices:
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER
dialog: Boyce! What're you--
text: Boyce steps around the curtain, to find a BED:
text: Chloe is in it, wounded but alive, tended to by Marie-Elena.
text: Paul sits in a corner.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Chloe?
text: She looks up, her eyes suddenly wet with tears. Boyce hurries
text: to her side, feeling very lucky. He takes her hand.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: (nods then: )
dialog: You?
text: Boyce breathes out a smile, Marie-Elena and Paul silent.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: I'm sorry about your father--
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER (0.S.)
dialog: --Boyce.
text: Grunauer, standing by the curtain. Boyce turns.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Derwin Frances.
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER
text: Back in bed.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Yeah, okay.
text: He turns to Chloe. She smiles bravely. Boyce gives her an
text: assuring look, turns to go--
dialog: 104.
text: ..-inadvertently putting his hand in his pocket, surprised to
text: find something there. He extracts it.
text: It's that WWI MEDAL... for VALOR. Ford's parting gift to him.
text: Boyce breathes out a sad smile, eyeing the medal, starts to
dialog: hand it back to Chloe.
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here. This doesn't belong to me.
text: Chloe closes Boyce's hand around the medal...
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Yes. It does.
dialog: She meant that, and it feels pretty good. So...
text: He kisses her. A big one. She gives into it. The kiss lingers
text: - the OTHER G.I.'s in here watching the silhouette of it
dialog: through the hospital curtain... until:
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER
dialog: Okay, Boyce. That'll do...
text: The kiss ends. Chloe beams; they've got a chance, these two.
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go.
text: Boyce nods. Grunauer tugs him away, leaving Chloe behind.
text: They head back across the barn to Boyce's bed - a few G.I.'s
dialog: now regarding Boyce as something of a celebrity...
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey, I'm sorry about Ford. Guy saved
dialog: my life up there.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Mine too.
text: They reach Boyce's cot.
speaker_heading: GRUNAUER
dialog: Rest up, awright?
text: Grunauer heads toward an AILING PATIENT. Boyce about to climb
text: back into his cot. But first he looks around--
text: ..-at these seven G.I.'s, silent and tight, some badly-
text: wounded, watching him. Rosenfeld too. Boyce regards them all.
dialog: Ford would've done something to help these men, no doubt
dialog: about it. So, after a long beat:
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: BOYCE
dialog: Guys, tell me something. On the
dialog: level. 'Cause I don't know if I'm
dialog: gonna get another chance to ask.
text: The WOUNDED G.I.'s wait. Boyce looks troubled, serious. Then:
speaker_heading: BOYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: stomach bandage)
dialog: Does this make me look fat?
text: Instant laughs, from guys who could use one. Boyce sits, as
dialog: we PULL BACK... out of this barn, to:
scene_heading: EXT. CIELBLANC - TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUING (DUSK)
text: This tortured village is now held by the U.S. Army: men,
text: vehicles, movement. The EVENING SKY is filled with planes,
text: all ours, soaring overhead with impunity.
text: We drift through, as G.I.'s and vehicles cross our frame.
dialog: Then we CRANE UP to take in all of Cielblanc: 20 houses, an
text: empty gallows, a church in ruins. And a very toppled tower.
text: One French village liberated, another few hundred to go. In
text: the distance, the moon rises over the Normandy Coast. We...
text: FADE OUT...
dialog:
