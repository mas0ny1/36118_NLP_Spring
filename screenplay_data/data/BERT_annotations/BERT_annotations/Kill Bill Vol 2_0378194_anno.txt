speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Do you find me sadistic?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: BLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN
text: lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has
text: just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her
text: face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W
text: turning the red blood into black blood.
text: A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME
text: holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the
text: corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the
text: young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice
text: speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the
dialog: audience.
text: But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that
text: shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the
text: "BILL" of the title.
dialog: In another age men who shook the world for their own purposes
dialog: were called conquerors. In our age, the men who shake the
dialog: planet for their own power and greed are called corrupters
text: And of the world's corrupters Bill stands alone. For while he
text: corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: I bet I could fry an egg on your
dialog: head about now, if I wanted to.
text: He continues wiping away the blood.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even
dialog: now, you're aware enough to know
text: there isn't a trace of sadism in
dialog: my actions... Okay - Maybe towards
dialog: these other jokers - bot not your.
speaker_heading: OVERHEAD SHOT
text: We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on
text: the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others
text: in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is
text: male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood.
text: We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated
dialog: by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending
text: on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a
text: white bridal gown.
dialog: This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she
dialog: will only be referred to as The BRIDE.
text: Back to CU of The BRIDE.
text: The BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean.
speaker_heading: BILL'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: No Kiddo at this moment, this is me
dialog: at my most masochistic.

text: While still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in
text: the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and
dialog: says;
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.
text: After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a BANG and The Bride

dialog: Nothing wrong with the name

speaker_heading: The BRIDE'S POV:
text: A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of

dialog: eyes.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
dialog: (That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see
text: it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding
text: chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four
text: people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the
text: face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.
text: The BRIDE ON THE PORCH
text: We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS
text: LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme
dialog: throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies
dialog: it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens
text: to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme
text: plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When
text: the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY
text: The white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of
text: the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of
dialog: the sofa.
text: These two wildcats go at each other savagely, TUMBLING OVER
text: the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing
text: together on the plush carpet.
speaker_heading: The HOUSEWIFE
text: KICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the
text: small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and
dialog: the mail is kept.
text: The Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a

dialog: into.....eee
text: An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has
text: framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a

dialog: fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war
dialog: the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and

text: THROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.
text: They land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked
text: in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,...
text: When The Housewife HEADBUTTS The Bride in the nose.
speaker_heading: The HOUSEWIFE
text: hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and

speaker_heading: The BRIDE

scene_heading: http://www. bol.ucla.edu/~alexward/script.htm Page 6 of 185
dialog: Kill Bill
text: hanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long,
text: double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what
dialog: Navy Seals use to kill humans with.)
text: The Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally
text: demolished living room.
text: The two woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each
text: looking like they know how to use it, each waiting for the
dialog: other to make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep
text: into the other one.
text: Blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women
dialog: locked in life and death combat......
text: ....When The back kitchen door opens, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD
text: LITTLE GIRL, carrying a lunch box steps inside.
scene_heading: FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
dialog: Mommy, I'm home!
text: The two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat
text: concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year

text: The Bride seems to answer back; "Okay."
text: The Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons
text: behind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks
text: into the newly destroyed living room.
text: The Housewife switches to her mommy voice.
speaker_heading: THE HOUSEWIFE
dialog: Hey baby, how was school?
text: The Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the

speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Mommy, what happened to you and the
dialog: T.V. Room?

text: The little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living

dialog: Her name is Nikki.
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: Nikki. What a pretty name for such

text: The two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat
dialog: both finished.
speaker_heading: THE HOUSEWIFE
dialog: Want some coffee?
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: Yeah, sure.
text: The two women move into the kitchen. The Bride re-sheaths her
text: SOG, and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the
dialog: drawer.
text: The Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife
text: pours both of them coffee.
speaker_heading: THE HOUSEWIFE
dialog: Cream and sugar?
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: Both, please.

dialog: This Pasadena homemaker's name is
dialog: Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr.
dialog: Lawrence Bell. But back when we

dialog: Kill Bill
dialog: Were you expecting me?
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: Yes and no. Bill got in touch with
dialog: me right after you woke up, and
dialog: then again a little later after
dialog: your episode in Japan.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So I suppose it's a little late for
dialog: a apology, huh?
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: You suppose correctly.
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: Even if I was sincere?
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: Oh. I'm quite positive you're
dialog: sorry, now.
text: Vernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with
dialog: low volume;
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: Look bitch, I need to know if
dialog: you're gonna start anymore shit
dialog: around my baby girl!
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: You can relax for now. I'm not
dialog: going to murder you in front of
dialog: your daughter.
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: That's being more rational than
dialog: Bill led me to believe you were
dialog: capable of.
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: Well that's a demonstration of
dialog: Bill's complete ignorance when it
dialog: comes to the subject of me, and
dialog: what I'm thinking, and what I might
dialog: do. It's mercy, compassion, and
dialog: forgiveness I lack, not
dialog: rationality.

speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: I'll wait for now, but I won't wait
dialog: for long. I'll allow you to choose
dialog: a time and place for us to meet
dialog: again, preferably as far away from
dialog: Nikki as possible.
dialog: I could have just HIT you, I
dialog: didn't, I demand respect for that.
dialog: Since this is not a HIT, consider
dialog: it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly
dialog: Vipers, we will observe Viper rules
dialog: of honor. One on one - no help - no
dialog: bushwhackin - no treacherous
dialog: weapons - on weapon of choice - our
dialog: skill and our bodies.
dialog: Vernita says her name;
speaker_heading: VERNITA
speaker_heading: * (BLEEP) *
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: - I'm not through telling you.
dialog: Failure to keep our date, or
dialog: duplicity of any kind, will result
dialog: in me putting a xoxo hollow point
dialog: bullet into the back of your skull
text: from a window of a building across
dialog: the street from Nikki's elementary
dialog: school. Now, feel free to respond.
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: Look...I know I fucked you over. I
dialog: fucked you over bad. I wish to God
dialog: I hadn't, but I did.
text: The blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face.
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: If I could go back in a machine I
dialog: would, but I can't. All I can tell
dialog: you is I'm a different person now.
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: Be that as it may, I know I do not
dialog: deserve mercy or forgiveness.
dialog: However, I beseech you for both on
dialog: behalf of my daughter.
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: Page 11 of 185
dialog: Kill Bill
dialog: -- Bitch, you can stop right there.
text: The B-word stops Vernita short, almost like a cold-handed
dialog: slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as
dialog: well).
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: (leans in close)
dialog: Just because I have no wish to
dialog: murder you before the eyes of your
dialog: daughter, does not mean parading
text: her around in front of me is going
dialog: to inspire sympathy. You and I have
dialog: unfinished business.
dialog: And not a goddamn fuckin thing
dialog: you've done in the subsequent five
dialog: years - including getting knocked
dialog: up - is going to change that.
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: You have every right to wanna get
dialog: even --
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: -- But that's where you're wrong,
dialog: Vernita. I don't want to get even.
dialog: To get even, even Steven. I would
dialog: have to kill you, go into Nikki's
dialog: room, kill her, then wait for your
dialog: old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and
dialog: kill him. That would make us even.
dialog: No, my unborn daughter will just
dialog: hafta be satisfied with your death

dialog: When do we do this?
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: It all depends... When do you want
dialog: to die? Tomorrow? The day after
dialog: tomorrow? That's about as long as
dialog: I'll wait.
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: How bout tonight, bitch?
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: Spendid. Where?

dialog: Kill Bill
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: There's a baseball diamond where

dialog: about a mile from here. We meet
dialog: there around two-thirty in the
dialog: morning, dressed all in black, your
dialog: hair in a black stocking, and we
dialog: have us a knife fight, we won't be
dialog: bothered. I have to fix Nikki's
dialog: cereal.
text: As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl
text: for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: Bill said you were one of the best
dialog: ladies he'd ever seen with an edged
dialog: weapon.
text: Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a
dialog: box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom."
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't
dialog: qualify it, so you can just kiss my
dialog: motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba.
dialog: (snorts to herself)
dialog: Black Mamba, I shoulda been
dialog: motherfuckin Black Mamba.
text: As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand

speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: Weapon of choice? And if you want
dialog: to stick with your butcher knife,
dialog: I'm cool with that.
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: Very funny.

text: Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES
dialog: again...
text: ...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen...

text: INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and

dialog: Kill Bill
text: the kitchen counter.
text: While her left hand holds the table, her right hand goes to
text: the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap around the blade's
text: grip, lifting it up out of the sheath and PLUNGING IT THROUGH
text: THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with all the SOG's steel
text: entering Vernita's abdomen.
text: The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker
text: pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes.
speaker_heading: VERNITA
dialog: Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please
dialog: don't...
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: Do to your daughter, what you did
dialog: to mine...
text: (she takes her hand
dialog: .».-I won't.
text: Vernita dies.
text: The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki
text: standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her
text: mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she
text: sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife
text: still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The
text: little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her
dialog: stare.
text: As she talks to the little girl, she removes an already
text: stained with blood white handkerchief with the name "BILL"
text: sewn on it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood
text: off her blade.
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE
dialog: It was not my intention to do this
dialog: in front of you. For that I'm
dialog: sorry. But you can take my word for
dialog: it, your mother had it coming. When
dialog: you grow up, if you still feel raw
dialog: about it, I'll be waiting.
dialog: And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride

speaker_heading: THE ORDERLY
dialog: Oh by the way, not all the time,

speaker_heading: The BRIDE

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BILL (V.0.; CONT'D)
dialog: ...head priest of The White Lotus
text: Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the
text: road, contemplating whatever a man
dialog: with Pai Mei's infinite power would
dialog: contemplate -- Which is another way
dialog: of saying, who knows. When, a
text: Shaolin monk appeared on the road
dialog: traveling in the opposite
text: direction. As the monk and the
dialog: priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --
text: in a practically unfathomable
dialog: display of generosity, gave the
text: monk the slightest of nods. The
dialog: nod, was not returned. Was it the
dialog: intention of the Shaolin monk to
dialog: insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just
dialog: fail to see the generous social
dialog: gesture?
dialog: The motives of the monk, remain,
dialog: unknown. What is known, were the
dialog: consequences. The next morning Pai
dialog: Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,
dialog: and demanded that the temple's head
dialog: Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to
dialog: repay the insult. The Abbot, at
dialog: first, tried to console Pai Mei,
dialog: only to find, Pai Mei was
dialog: inconsolable. So began, the
dialog: massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and
text: all sixty of the monks inside, at
dialog: the fists of the White Lotus. And
dialog: so began, the legend of Pai Mei's
dialog: Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart
dialog: Technique.
speaker_heading: THE BRIDE (V.O.)
dialog: What praytell, is a ten-point palm -
dialog: exploding heart technique?
speaker_heading: BILL (V.0O.)
dialog: Quite simply, the deadliest blow in
text: all of the martial arts. He hits
dialog: you with his fingertips, at ten
dialog: different pressure points on your
dialog: body. And then, he lets you walk
dialog: away. But once you've taken five
dialog: steps, your heart explodes inside
dialog: your body, and you fall to the
dialog: floor dead.
dialog: We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five
text: shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then
text: fall to the floor dead.

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No. He teaches no one the ten-point

text: But he is Nietzsche's psalm
dialog: personified. If Pai Mei doesn't
dialog: kill you, he will make you

dialog: always liked about you, Kiddo, is
dialog: you appear wise beyond your years.
dialog: Then allow me to impart, a word to
dialog: the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -
dialog: Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash
dialog: him - even for an instant - a

text: She takes the sword from him and tries again.
text: But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the

speaker_heading: PAI MEI *
dialog: That blade's sharp. Careful not to

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad

dialog: (to B.B.)
dialog: You want to tell Mommy about what

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Emilio was her goldfish. She came

dialog: die?" And what did you say?
dialog: B.B.
dialog: I stepped on him.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Actually young lady, the words you
dialog: so strategically used were, "I
dialog: accidentally stepped on him."
dialog: Right?
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: To which I queried, "And just how
dialog: did your foot accidentally find its
dialog: way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And
dialog: she told me no no no, Emilio was on

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And
dialog: just how did Emilio get on the
dialog: carpet? And Mommy, you would have
dialog: been real proud of her, because she
dialog: didn't lie. She said she took

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What did that mean?

dialog: He was dead.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Mommy)
dialog: She told me later, that the second
text: she lifted up her foot and saw him

dialog: powerful even a five-year old child

dialog: knew what it meant. Not only did
dialog: she know Emilio was dead, she knew
dialog: she had killed him. So she comes
text: running into my room, holding
text: Emilio in both of her little hands -
dialog: it was so cute - and she wanted me
dialog: to make Emilio better. And I asked
dialog: her, why did she step on Emilio?
dialog: And she said, she didn't know. But
dialog: I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt
dialog: Emilio, you just wanted to see what
dialog: would happen if you stepped on him,
dialog: right?
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: And what happens when you stomp on
dialog: Emilio, is you kill him. And you
dialog: discovered that, didn't you?
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: So we drove down to the beach, had
dialog: a little funeral, and gave Emilio a
dialog: burial at sea. And right now I'm
dialog: sure he's happy as can be, swimmin
text: around in fish heaven.
dialog: But the point being, our child
dialog: learned two very important lessons
dialog: One, about life and death. The
dialog: other, somethings once you do, they

dialog: she felt
dialog: (to B.B.)
dialog: You loved Emilio, didn't you?
dialog: Uh-huh.

dialog: The morning I left, I threw up. I

dialog: my room and took the test. The
dialog: little strip said blue. I was going

dialog: What I didn't know, was at some leg
dialog: of my journey, I was spotted. With
