dialog: THE SPY WHO DUMPED ME
speaker_heading: FIRST DRAFT
dialog: August 2016
scene_heading: EXT. EASTERN EUROPE - OUTDOOR MARKET - DAWN
dialog: 
text: A MAN -- rugged, square chin, hasn’t slept or shaven in days.
text: This is DREW THAYER (30s). He wears a thick coat, tries not
dialog: to stand out. He’s not from around here.
text: “Here” is a bleak, locals-only market surrounded by crumbling
text: Soviet-era buildings. Anemic vegetables. Dried meat. Fish.
dialog: Handmade woolens. This place isn’t in a Lonely Planet guide.
scene_heading: VILNIUS, LITHUANIA
dialog: Drew shouldn’t be out in public but he needs to eat. He
text: glances around furtively as he buys a ROLL from a BAKER.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (Lithuanian)
dialog: Thank you.
text: He sees something in his periphery -- his gears turn -- knows
text: he'll have to run. Or fight. Probably both. He crosses to --
text: A table of sad Chernobyl-looking shit manned by a skinny
text: LITTLE GIRL -- bootleg Snoopy alarm clock, filthy handmade
text: dolls -- one man’s trash... Drew picks up a HAND MIRROR.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: (broken English)
dialog: Three Euro.
text: Drew ignores her, uses the mirror to look behind him -- at a
text: FLOWER STAND there’s a THUG. Shaved head. Flat nose from
dialog: repeated breaks. The kind of man who’d never buy you flowers.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: (broken English)
dialog: Two? I give you for two.
text: Drew puts the mirror down and walks away.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: One-fifty... ?
scene_heading: EXT. WOOLEN STAND - CONTINUOUS
text: Colorful clothes sway as Drew slips behind them. The THUG
text: appears... looks around... Then suddenly -- a STRIPED SCARF
text: ensnares his neck. Tightens, tightens -- Thug gasps for air.
text: Drew’s behind him -- he’s done this before -- Thug kicks,
text: knocks over a table of mittens -- The AGING VENDOR SCREAMS.
text: Then it’s over. Thug goes LIMP. Drew holds him by the waist
text: with one hand, swiftly reaches the other to his belt. Pulls
text: out Thug’s HANDGUN and lets the dead body fall into a PUDDLE.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: (Lithuanian)
dialog: Savages! You pay for this mess!
text: As Drew drops a stack of Euros onto her table...
text: ANOTHER GUY jumps out. Probably his brother. Bigger -- if
text: that’s possible. Drew FIRES -- but his target’s ready for it
text: and dives behind a BUTCHER’S STAND. Drew FIRES again... most
text: of the bullets hit SALAMI. But his last bullet HITS the guy’s
text: CHEST. He falls. Drew calmly moves in to finish the job.
dialog: Click. Gun’s empty. Fuck.
text: As the guy gasps for life, goes for his own gun -- Drew yanks
text: down a SALAMI, smacks the guy’s hand with it -- a makeshift
text: bat -- then leaps onto his chest. With one hand, Drew holds
text: the guy’s nose -- with the other, shoves the jagged, broken
text: SALAMI DOWN THE GUY'S THROAT. Bad way to die. But at least
text: there’s no one coming after him now.
text: Wait. Spoke too soon. From around the corner, a MAN with a
text: horrible 1994 haircut comes at Drew -- GUN BLASTING. Drew
text: DUCKS. He WEAVES. Drew dives around the corner, disappearing.
text: The GUNFIRE keeps coming...
scene_heading: INT. BARCADE - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
text: The GUNFIRE now comes from DUCK HUNT -- the old Nintendo
text: game. We’re in a retro arcade-themed bar and the shooter of
text: the ORANGE PLASTIC HANDGUN is AUDREY. She turns 27 today. She
text: decimates duck after duck, insanely good at this game.
dialog: Unlike every female character in every other movie, Audrey
text: knows exactly how beautiful she is. Like a 7. Maybe an 8 if
text: she wasn’t wearing her tacky Hawaiian TRADER JOE’S UNIFORM.
scene_heading: LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA
text: MORGAN (27), her best friend, walks over with TWO BEERS.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: You can’t stand over here all night.
dialog: Morgan’s parents always told her she could be anything,
dialog: including a rocket scientist or a supermodel, if she wanted.
text: Morgan totally buys that. Girl has zero insecurities.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Why? I’m having a good time.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Because it’s your birthday party.
text: Behind Audrey: some FRIENDS, a half-eaten supermarket cake.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Right. And for my birthday, I want
dialog: to stand in the corner and not talk
dialog: to anyone who isn’t caught up on my
dialog: life. Everyone’s gonna ask me what
dialog: I’m up to cause that’s what you do,
dialog: and I’1ll have to tell everyone that
dialog: I’m not up to anything.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Audrey...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Look at me. I’m twenty-seven years
dialog: old and I work at Trader Joe’s. I
dialog: wear a Hawaiian shirt to work and I
dialog: am neither Hawaiian nor Jimmy
dialog: Buffett. Like, three years ago what
dialog: I’m doing was considered “finding
dialog: myself.” Now I’m suddenly at the
dialog: age where people feel bad for me
dialog: for doing the exact same thing.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Who feels bad for you? I’1l kill
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: My parents called today. They spent
dialog: five seconds saying happy birthday,
dialog: and the next forty-five minutes
dialog: bragging about how my brother Adam
text: is about to cure Cystic Fibrosis.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Fuck Cystic Fibrosis.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Actually, it’s a really serious
text: disease. Adam has a huge heart.
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: And everyone’s gonna ask about Drew.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Fuck Drew. That guy was a dick.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You're just saying that to make me
dialog: feel better. You never said that
dialog: when we were together.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Well yeah. You can’t say shit about
dialog: your friend’s current boyfriend.
dialog: But dude, he dumped you in a text.
text: Objectively, he suuuucks.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Or he just wasn’t in love with me.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Audrey, you control the narrative
dialog: here. It’s all about spin. Look at
dialog: me. Am I successful? Not in the
dialog: conventional sense of being like,
dialog: employed. But ask me what I'm doing
dialog: with my life.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Say, hey Morgan, what have you been
dialog: up to lately?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (flat)
dialog: Hey Morgan. What have you been up
dialog: to lately?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Getting in touch with my gifts.
dialog: Voice lessons. Stage combat. So no
dialog: matter what roles come along in
dialog: theater, film, or life’s journey
dialog: itself, I'm ready. It's a beautiful
dialog: thing as a woman to empower
dialog: yourself like that, you know?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Okay that was amazing.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Hey, do I have your e-mail? My one
dialog: woman show is really coming together.
text: TESS (27) walks in. She’s anorexic, personality-free and a
dialog: huge cunt. (We’re taking back that word, sorry!)
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Shit. It’s Tess. Don’t make me talk
dialog: to Tess. She’s gonna do that thing
dialog: she always does, where she gives me
text: a bullshit compliment then pivots
dialog: it into something super insulting.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Audrey. Spin. You got this. Here...
text: She hands Audrey a tube of lipstick.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Put this on. Tell the world you’re
dialog: trying. Ideally, you’d change out
dialog: of your work clothes too but...
text: Morgan walks away. Tess is now next to Audrey.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Hey lady! Oh my God, those earrings
dialog: are so cute! Are those shells?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Where’s your adorable boyfriend? You
dialog: guys are such a surprising couple!
text: Audrey just... can’t. She takes the plastic gun from the
text: game, puts it to her OWN TEMPLE. Pulls the trigger and
text: dramatically FAKE DIES. Tess has no idea how to react.
scene_heading: EXT. VILNIUS ALLEY - DAY
text: Drew runs down stairs down to a rusty basement door. It’s
text: locked. Drew turns, sprints back to an overflowing DUMPSTER.
text: He grabs a busted HAIR DRYER. This’1ll do. He bashes it on the
text: ground til the innards are exposed. Yanks out a HEATING COIL.
text: BACK AT THE DOOR -- Drew picks the lock with the coil. He’s
text: fast. Walks in like he owns the place.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT OF LITHUANIAN BROTHEL - DAY
text: A tall LATEX-CLAD DOMINATRIX clicks a REMOTE CONTROL. Across
text: the room: a MAN suspended from a harness wearing only
text: underwear, tattoos and piercings -- his nipples hooked up to
text: electrodes. He screams in pain/gratification.
text: Nonplussed, Drew brushes past -- grabs a WHIP, CHAINS, and a
text: SPIKED COLLAR for later use. He shoves them into his jacket.
scene_heading: INT. LITHUANIAN BROTHEL - DAY
dialog: Upstairs, WOMEN IN LINGERIE work the early-morning shift. You
text: could catch herpes just by looking at them. Drew emerges and
text: the ANCIENT MADAM approaches, cigarette dangling. Drew hands
dialog: her a wad of cash. He’s done this before.
speaker_heading: MADAM
dialog: (Lithuanian)
dialog: Which one?
text: Drew points to a young, thin, SPOOKED GIRL. She nods. Drew
text: takes the spooked girl’s hand and she leads him upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. BROTHEL - UPSTAIRS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Drew closes the door behind them. The girl starts to take off
text: her clothes, speaks in Broken English.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: No. Keep them on.
text: Drew pulls the SPIKED COLLAR out of his jacket. The Girl is
text: terrified. But Drew crosses to the WINDOW, opens it.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: What you into?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (Lithuanian)
dialog: I’m into you never saw me.
text: With that, Drew hands her more money than she’s ever seen in
text: her life ($25 USD). Then turns the COLLAR upside down and
text: loops it over the POWER LINE out the window. He jumps out.
scene_heading: EXT. BROTHEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Drew ZIPLINES out of the brothel, over rooftops, and finally
text: jumps off on a LANDING outside the open window of a --
scene_heading: INT. RAMSHACKLE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: TWO BORED TEENAGERS watch THE MINDY PROJECT dubbed in
text: Lithuanian. They barely look up as Drew runs past them --
scene_heading: INT. RAMSHACKLE HOUSE - KITCHEN
text: The MATRIARCH ladles BORSCHT from a pot. Seeing Drew, she
text: SCREAMS and drops it, Pepto Bismol pink everywhere. SIRENS
text: WAIL in the distance.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (Lithuanian)
dialog: Keys.
scene_heading: EXT. VILNIUS ROAD - MINUTES LATER
text: Drew whizzes down a COBBLESTONE STREET on a MOPED. TWO COP
text: CARS round the corner, in hot pursuit.
scene_heading: INT. BARCADE - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
text: Morgan sits at the bar, flirting with Eurotrash VIKTOR --
text: shaved head, Ukrainian football tracksuit.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Such a coincidence. I just
dialog: auditioned to be a Ukrainian farm
dialog: girl in a Geico spot. Wait, so is
dialog: it "Ukraine" or “The Ukraine?"
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You say how you like. Always let
text: beautiful woman decide.
text: Morgan swoons... then notices Audrey, head pressed mournfully
text: against the JUKEBOX. Draining her SCOTCH. She puts it on top
text: of the juke next to TWO OTHER EMPTIES. Morgan grimaces.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Hey, Viktor? Hold that thought.
text: Morgan crosses to Audrey.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Why did I have my birthday here?
dialog: This is where I met Drew.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Enough. After tonight, I never want
text: to hear the name “Drew” again. Even
dialog: if you, like, “drew” me a picture,
dialog: you say “I painted you something
dialog: with pencils.” You have to move on.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I know. It’s just kinda hard to do
dialog: that when he left that box of shit
dialog: in our apartment that I have to see
dialog: every day. He won’t even text me
dialog: back about picking it up.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Let me see your phone for a sec.
text: Audrey hands her CELL over. Morgan finds the BREAKUP TEXT.
dialog: “Hey there -- it’s over. Sorry.”
text: Morgan then scrolls through a series of UNANSWERED REPLIES
dialog: from Audrey: Why / What are you... / Call me / WIF? / How can
text: you... Then she starts a NEW TEXT MESSAGE.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Who are you texting?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Drew. “Fuck you, you worthless pussy
dialog: -- I’m setting your shit on fire.”
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Why are you saying that?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Because we’re gonna go set his
dialog: fucking shit on fire. I love
text: setting things on fire.
scene_heading: EXT. VILNIUS SLUMS - DAY
text: Drew speeds through the decrepit, graffitied streets, ona
text: mission. He parks behind a burnt out APARTMENT COMPLEX.
text: He looks at his cell -- GRIMACES. Then rounds the corner and
text: sees something worse -- Three GIANT THUGS waiting for him.
text: Drew takes the long way around the building, stealthily
text: pulling the WHIP and CHAINS from his jacket. He rounds the
text: corner -- now behind the men -- and just STARTS SWINGING. In
text: seconds, all three men are bloody messes. Two knocked out,
text: the other moaning in pain. Drew steps over them.
scene_heading: INT. AUDREY AND MORGAN’S FIRE ESCAPE - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Typical L.A. stucco fourplex. Audrey and Morgan stand
text: drunkenly on the fire escape over a BANKERS BOX of Drew’s
text: stuff. Morgan holds a bottle of LIGHTER FLUID. Audrey
text: gingerly picks up a pair of BOXER BRIEFS.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Really Drew? Skid marks on your
dialog: underwear? Are you eight? Was I
dialog: supposed to wash this for you? Is
dialog: that why you dumped me? I didn’t
dialog: mother you enough?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Fuck you and wipe your own ass!
text: Next, Audrey picks up a small PLASTIC TROPHY shaped like a
text: VICTORIOUS FOOTBALL PLAYER. The plaque reads: SECOND PLACE.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Your Fantasy Football trophy for
dialog: SECOND place? And you saved it?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: It’s not even real football. It’s a
dialog: fucking fantasy.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: And I'm a real fucking person. So
dialog: if you think you’re gonna get some
dialog: supermodel who also has nothing
dialog: better to do with her time than
dialog: blow you while you watch the
dialog: game... uh, fuck you.
text: Morgan pulls out a STRAIGHT TO DVD SPY ACTION MOVIE.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Um, speaking of fantasy, say
dialog: goodbye to your straight-to-DVD
dialog: shitty action movie starring Ryan
dialog: Phillipe and Mischa Barton!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That you forced me to watch with
dialog: you. I will never get those 82
dialog: minutes back. There’s like one
text: review on the cover. Three and a
dialog: half stars from
dialog: JeffreyLovesMovies.com?!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: And you got it used at Chevron?
dialog: Really Drew? You walked into a gas
dialog: station and you’re like, yes! One
dialog: copy of “Marked Target” please.
dialog: Here’s $3.99.
text: Morgan pours LIGHTER FLUID all over the box and its contents.
text: She hands Audrey a matchbox.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You do the honors, birthday girl.
text: Audrey takes the matches. We’re CLOSE on the MATCH
text: LIGHTING... and then... BUZZ. Her cell, in her pocket.
text: Audrey shakes out the match and pulls out her phone...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It’s... Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW (V.0.)
dialog: Hey.
scene_heading: INT. DREW’S SHITTY VILNIUS APARTMENT - INTERCUT
dialog: Not a place you’d want to spend the night in. Peeling walls,
text: roaches, bare light bulb. Drew paces, earpiece in, checking
text: the SURVEILLANCE SCREENS by his bed.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Really? That’s it? “Hey?”
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Audrey, I'm so sorry. I fucked up.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Tell him to go fuck himself.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I'll come by your place tomorrow. I
dialog: can explain everything... and I’1l
dialog: get the stuff I left there.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: So that’s why you called? Just to
dialog: get your shit back? Awesome.
dialog: 10.
text: She awaits a response. But Drew’s busy PUNCHING THE DRYWALL
text: by his night stand. In the hole: a SECRET STASH of MONEY,
text: PASSPORTS and GUNS. Drew stuffs it in his POCKETS.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s my birthday, by the way.
text: Drew hears a GUN COCK. Someone’s behind him.
text: ON AUDREY: The line goes DEAD.
text: ON DREW -- spinning around -- knocking the gun from his
text: attacker, an OLDER THUG. They know each other. No weapons
text: now. They punch and kick, equally matched.
speaker_heading: OLDER THUG
dialog: Fight me all you want but you have
dialog: more problems coming. You know what
dialog: they want.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: They’re not getting it.
speaker_heading: OLDER THUG
dialog: They’11 get it when you’re dead.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I can handle dead. Can you?
text: Drew PINS the old thug to the floor with one hand. CRACKS HIS
text: NECK with the other. Drew shakes off the body and moves to --
speaker_heading: THE KITCHENETTE
text: Drew pulls a bag of MICROWAVE POPCORN from an almost-bare
text: cupboard. Then, from the hole in the wall, delicately --
speaker_heading: A BRICK OF C-4
text: Drew affixes it to the bag of NEWMAN’S OWN (in Cyrillic),
text: tosses it in the microwave, presses the POPCORN SETTING. The
text: popcorn STARTS POPPING...
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF VILNIUS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Drew walks away from his building as his apartment EXPLODES.
dialog: In the flames, our title:
dialog: THE SPY WHO DUMPED ME
scene_heading: INT. BARCADE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: A year ago. Audrey, happier, before her heartbreak. She’s at
text: the jukebox, flipping. She’s lightly bumped on the back.
speaker_heading: DREW (0.S.)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 11.
text: Audrey turns, notices DREW behind her. Back then he was clean-
text: shaven, like any guy you’d see in a Silver Lake bar.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That’s okay.
text: Audrey’s wears a “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” PARTY STORE TIARA.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh. Hey. Happy birthday.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What?
dialog: (off tiara, deadpan)
dialog: Oh, this? It’s not my birthday. I
dialog: just wear this for warmth.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Well, if it was your birthday, I
dialog: would say happy birthday.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: And I would say thank you.
text: A moment. They’re clearly feeling a vibe.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey, can I get your help with
dialog: something really really important?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I do consider myself a problem-
dialog: solver.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I have one quarter left. Your
dialog: mission, should you choose to
dialog: accept it, is to find the absolute
dialog: worst song on this jukebox.
text: Drew smiles, joins her.
scene_heading: INT. TRADER JOE'S - DAY (PRESENT)
text: Audrey snaps out of the memory, hands a CUSTOMER a RECEIPT.
text: She’s at her shitty CASHIER JOB at Trader Joe’s.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Thank you. Have a great day.
text: Audrey notices her reflection in a MIRROR by the register.
text: She looks hung over. Remembering Morgan’s words, she pulls
text: out the LIPSTICK and applies it. Almost immediately --
text: SEBASTIAN HENSHAW (30) -- shirt, tie, charming, British --
text: steps to her register. With NO GROCERIES. Audrey’s confused.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yes... one gum please.
text: He hastily grabs the nearest pack of GUM and hands her a
text: dollar. As Audrey rings him up.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Have a nice day.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: ...Sebastian. Aren’t you going to
dialog: ask me if I need help to my car?
text: Audrey smiles. He’s flirting with her. Well, look at that.
scene_heading: EXT. TRADER JOE'S PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Audrey follows Sebastian to a far corner of the parking lot.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So, where are you from?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: England.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That’s what I thought. But
dialog: sometimes when I think that, people
dialog: end up being Australian.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (amused)
dialog: People do sometimes end up being
dialog: Australian.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: (then, flustered)
dialog: Sorry, I didn’t really mean shut
dialog: up. It’s a figure of speech. I
dialog: dunno if you do that in England...
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Figures of speech? We invented that.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Some would say I’m not exercising
text: good judgment, following a strange
dialog: man through a parking lot. I mean,
dialog: this is how people get shoved into
dialog: the back of sketchy vans, right?
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: Get in the van.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What?
text: REVEAL Sebastian’s stopping in front of a BLACK VAN with
text: TINTED WINDOWS. The DOOR OPENS from the inside. Sebastian
text: flashes a BADGE.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Federal agent.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - DAY
text: The van moves. Sebastian faces Audrey. Next to him is TOPHER
text: PATEL (30) -- a smarmy jerk. Audrey is beyond freaked out.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What's going on? Am I in trouble? I
dialog: didn't do anything wrong.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: There’s nothing to be afraid of,
dialog: Ms. Stockman.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Says the guy who just kidnapped me.
dialog: And knows my name. Oh my God what
dialog: the fuck is happening... ?
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: We just want to talk. About Drew
dialog: Thayer. He's your boyfriend, right?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: No. I mean he was. But we broke up.
dialog: Why? Is he in trouble or something?
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Yes. Drew is in a lot of trouble.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Do you know where your ex-boyfriend
dialog: worked, Ms. Stockman?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah. NPR. He has this podcast
dialog: about... um, honestly, I’m not
dialog: positive. The episode I listened to
dialog: was about little-known composers of
dialog: the 18th Century... well, I
dialog: listened to most of it.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Nobody listened to that podcast.
dialog: Not even me and I went to Harvard.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Wow. Only took you two minutes.
dialog: (flat)
dialog: Patel went to Harvard.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: That podcast was Drew’s cover job.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: He never said anything about having
dialog: another job.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: That’s what “cover” means, hon.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Okay I know. I’m not stupid. I’m
dialog: just... processing. This is a lot.
dialog: What was it a cover for?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Drew was a CIA agent.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Wait, what?!
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Then he stole things he shouldn’t
dialog: have and killed people he shouldn't
dialog: have. Now he’s on the run.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: And if we don’t find him, a lot of
dialog: innocent people are going to die.
dialog: Do you want that to happen?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No! Jesus. No. Look, I’m with you
dialog: that Drew’s an asshole. I just
dialog: can't believe he’s... a killer.
text: Sebastian pulls out a FOLDER of PHOTOS. Grainy surveillance
text: pictures of Drew -- with guns, making a drop, stabbing a man
text: in the neck. Audrey gets more anxious as she flips through.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God. OH MY GOD.
text: She stops at a photo of HERSELF with DREW, in VEGAS.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: You guys were in Vegas when we saw
dialog: Celine Dion?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Ironically.
text: He hands her another photo. TWO DEAD BODIES by a CRAPS TABLE.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Has Drew been in touch since you
dialog: broke up?
dialog: ON AUDREY - should she tell them?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No... well, yes. He called me last
dialog: night. I mean, he called me back.
dialog: Finally. I had called him like a
dialog: thousand times.
dialog: (self-conscious)
dialog: After he disappeared. I called him
dialog: a normal amount when we were
dialog: together. I'm normal.
scene_heading: INT. AUDREY’S APARTMENT - DAY
text: An Ikea-filled two-bedroom. Audrey rushes in, still in her
dialog: uniform (she’1l continue to be until we say otherwise.)
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Morgan! Morgan!
text: Morgan emerges from the kitchen in her bra and underwear, mid-
text: phone call. Peeling and eating string cheese.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: ...Yeah, Mom. Audrey just got home.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I have to talk to you.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Dude, I have to talk to you. I
dialog: slept with Viktor.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: From your birthday party.
text: Behind her, Viktor emerges in nothing but RED LYCRA BRIEFS.
text: He kisses Morgan intensely, then grabs a sleeve of CRACKERS.
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: I will hit shower, yes?
text: He heads into the bathroom. The shower runs.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: What? Sorry, Mom, I’m kind of ina
dialog: sex haze...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hmm. I don’t know, I’11 ask her.
dialog: Audrey, have you ever been with an
dialog: uncircumcised guy?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Morgan!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Audrey thinks I tell you guys too
dialog: much... I know! I think it’s
dialog: healthy too. But yeah, I know most
text: European guys are uncircumcised.
dialog: Like when I first saw it I was
dialog: like, ew this looks like an unbaked
text: crescent roll. But then it’s like
dialog: when it’s in there, the whole thing

dialog: this doesn’t sound like it would
dialog: feel good -- but it’s like your
text: insides are covered in scotch tape.
dialog: Wait, duh, you already know this,
dialog: Mom. You did a year abroad.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
text: MORGAN HANG UP THE FUCKING PHONE!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I’1l call you back.
dialog: (hangs up)
dialog: Jesus. What?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: These guys from the CIA came to
dialog: Trader Joe’s today. To talk about
dialog: Drew. They said... he's a spy.
text: Morgan cracks up, assuming she’s kidding.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm serious. They showed me
dialog: pictures of him with like, weapons
text: and dead bodies. People he killed.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Wait. What?!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I know it sounds fucking batshit.
dialog: But think about it. There were just
dialog: so many unanswered questions with
dialog: that guy...
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Yeah there were. Like if he really
dialog: went to Vassar, why does he
dialog: pronounce it Liberry?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Oh my fucking God!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Thank you! That is the appropriate
dialog: reaction!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: No. Behind you!
text: Audrey turns. DREW is on the fire escape, wresting the window
text: open. He smiles. Ugh. It's a charming fucking smile.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (reeling)
dialog: Hi...
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: So you have my stuff?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah...
text: Then Audrey snaps out of it, remembers how angry she’s been.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait, that’s all you have to say?
dialog: What happened to you explaining
dialog: everything?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I will, just right now I’m ina
dialog: rush. Where’s the stuff? Your room?
text: He just heads for her room. Audrey follows, pissed off.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Stop. You can’t just go in there.
scene_heading: INT. AUDREY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Audrey walks in to find Drew grabbing THE BOX on the floor.
text: She shuts the door behind him. They share a silent look.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Hey. Asshole. We’re not together.
dialog: There are like, rules.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (re: the box)
text: This smells like lighter fluid.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah. I wasn’t kidding when I said
dialog: I was gonna burn your shit.
text: But Drew just keeps moving, back to...
scene_heading: INT. AUDREY AND MORGAN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Audrey follows Drew as he heads back to the window. This is
text: all happening so fast. But it’s her last chance to say it...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I know you’re a spy.
text: This finally stops Drew. His face drops. He turns around.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: People from the CIA came to my work.
dialog: They made me get in a van and showed
dialog: me pictures of people you killed.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What did you tell them?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You're not gonna give me a bullshit
dialog: excuse about how this is a joke your
dialog: coworkers are playing on you? And
dialog: those pictures were photoshopped?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Audrey...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It was fucking scary, Drew.
text: Drew is PANICKED. Checks windows, behind doors, opens the
text: closet. Then, he pulls a HANDGUN out of his jacket.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus! Fuck.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Audrey. Listen to me. I need to
dialog: know exactly what you told them.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What’s on your head?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What?
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You have a red dot on your head.
text: Sure enough, there’s a LASER SIGHT right between Drew's eyes.
text: GUNSHOTS -- BANG -- shattering windows. Drew springs to
text: action, SHOVES AUDREY behind the COUCH -- pulls them both
text: down and holds her close. It’s weirdly intimate.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: What the fuck is going on?
text: Then she sees the BLOOD. Drew’s been shot twice in the CHEST.
dialog: But he’s ALIVE. Audrey GASPS--
scene_heading: INT. MORGAN’S BEDROOM - SAME
text: Morgan is still on the phone again as she gets dressed.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: What the fuck was that?!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Dad, I have to call you back.
scene_heading: INT. AUDREY AND MORGAN’S LIVING ROOM - SAME
text: BEHIND THE SOFA. GUNFIRE doesn’t let up. Drew speaks, urgent.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Audrey... bad people are after me--
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: The CIA guys?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: There’s more than just the CIA
dialog: chasing me. And now they’re after
dialog: you too. Fuck. This is exactly what
dialog: I didn’t want -- you in danger.
dialog: That’s why I broke up with you.
text: Before Audrey can respond, Drew reaches into the box and
text: pulls out his FANTASY FOOTBALL TROPHY.
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: But we’re in this together now. And
dialog: a lot of innocent people are gonna
dialog: die if we don’t bring this where it
dialog: needs to go. So listen. We’re gonna
dialog: leave this apartment, we’re gonna
dialog: fly to Vienna, and give this to
dialog: someone named Verne at the Hotel
dialog: Sacher Cafe at 6pm tomorrow...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Why are you telling me this if
dialog: we're going together?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: In case I don’t make it out of here
text: alive. Verne. 6pm. Hotel Sacher
dialog: Cafe. Then you'll be safe. And so
dialog: will everyone else. Got it?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Drew, you’re not gonna die --
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Listen. Don’t trust anybody.
text: The bathroom door opens and VIKTOR appears in the doorway.
text: TOTALLY NAKED. CLOSE ON: HIS WEIRD UNCIRCUMCISED DICK.
speaker_heading: AUDREY /DREW
dialog: Eughhhhhh!
text: Viktor pulls out a GUN, SHOOTS Drew in the HEART point blank.
dialog: Audrey’s next...
text: THEN. Morgan RUNS out of her room like a banshee. PLOWS into
text: Viktor full force, shoving him into --
speaker_heading: THE KITCHEN
text: Before he can catch his balance, she pushes Viktor out the
text: open window. He SCREAMS as he FALLS to his death.
text: Audrey and Morgan are in total shock. Drew is dead! The
text: shooting’s stopped -- But only because they now hear a
text: BATTALION OF FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We have to get the fuck out of here!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Oh my God, Drew!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We have to go. Now!
text: As they BOLT for the FIRE ESCAPE, Audrey yanks the FOOTBALL
text: TROPHY out of Drew’s dead hands. She spots a wad of FOREIGN
text: BILLS in his jacket. Stuffs them in her pockets.
text: Overwhelmed, Audrey gives Drew one last look. Is there
text: something she could have done? But it’s too late now.
scene_heading: ANGLE on the DOOR as a SWARM of SPECIAL FORCES PERSONNEL
text: burst in, led by SEBASTIAN and PATEL.
text: But the girls are gone.
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: I/E. AUDREY’S HONDA CIVIC - DAY
text: Audrey, shaking, fighting tears, drives as fast as she can --
text: not terribly fast. A conservative driver. Morgan’s shotgun.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Where are we going?!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I don’t know. Give me a minute.
dialog: Okay. Where would we be safe?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Pull into this parking lot. There’s
text: a bathroom in Pilates Plus.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We’re not hiding in fucking Pilates
dialog: Plus! Where’s the police station? I
dialog: think I voted there...
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: We can’t go to the police. I just
dialog: killed someone. And I have a ton of
dialog: unpaid speeding tickets. And...
dialog: Black Lives Matter.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You killed someone in self-defense.
dialog: That doesn’t count.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Just call those CIA agents.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Drew said we can’t trust anyone.
text: And he’s right. He’s dead. Probably
dialog: because I talked to them.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Or because I brought an assassin
dialog: into our apartment.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Okay so it’s both our faults.
text: Audrey slows as she approaches a STOP SIGN.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Go! Why are you stopping at stop
dialog: signs? People are after us.
text: Audrey nervously SPEEDS through the stop sign.
text: Then her PHONE RINGS on the BLUETOOTH. BLOCKED NUMBER. She
text: inhales, picks it up. It plays through the CAR SPEAKERS.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Audrey? It’s Sebastian.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You killed Drew. I told you where
dialog: he was gonna be and you killed him.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Who is this asshole?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Are you in the car?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: What did Drew say to you?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Why would I tell you anything after
dialog: everything you’ve done?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Audrey. Where are you taking it?
text: Audrey eyes the TROPHY, on the car’s console.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Give us the package. Trust me.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I don’t trust anyone anymore.
text: Audrey HANGS UP. A moment.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: You trust me though, right?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Of course. Not counting you.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Good. Cause this isn’t like, a fake
dialog: spy friendship that the Russians
dialog: put together.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Dude, shut up. I know.
dialog: (grabbing the trophy)
dialog: Drew said a lot of people are gonna
dialog: die if we don’t deliver this.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: What people?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: He didn’t get that far. But he was
text: like, lying on the floor about to
dialog: die when he said it. I know he lied
dialog: about a lot of shit, but like...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: if I don’t do what he said and a
dialog: bunch of people die, in a terrorist
dialog: attack or whatever, I will always
dialog: wonder if I could have stopped it.
text: Morgan thinks about this.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: That would fucking suck.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What did he say we have to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Bring this to some cafe in Vienna.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Vienna? As in, Austria, Vienna?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That’s what he said.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Then... why don’t we do that?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Why don’t we go to Europe when
dialog: people are trying to kill us?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: They’re trying to kill us here too.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: But we’re just like, regular
dialog: people. Yes, we happen to be in
dialog: this extreme situation right now
dialog: but we are not qualified to like...
dialog: do some international spy mission.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: It doesn’t sound like a whole
dialog: “mission.” It’s just doing this one
dialog: thing. Versus staying here and
dialog: getting killed. Plus, you’ve never
dialog: been to Europe. Do you really want
dialog: to die never having gone to Europe?
dialog: Or do you want to go to Europe and
dialog: die, having been to Europe?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Why are those my only two options?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I don’t know, cause you dated a spy?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You fucked an assassin.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: That I did.
text: Morgan opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT, pulls out PASSPORTS.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m just saying. Our passports are
dialog: still in here from our road trip to
dialog: Mexico. And I have my dad’s credit
dialog: card for emergencies...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are we going to Austria?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I think we’re going to Austria.
text: Audrey sharp-turns on to the FREEWAY ON-RAMP.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: But we should ditch our phones. Bad
dialog: guys can track us with our phones.
text: Even if the phone is off.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I went to summer camp with Edward
dialog: Snowden.
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: First hand job. Oh my God that guy
dialog: was obsessed with me.
text: She grabs Audrey’s phone and fishes hers from her bag.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And he was really into ska.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Weird.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Right? When that whole thing was
dialog: going down, I was like - hello, why
dialog: is no one talking about how Edward
dialog: Snowden is really into ska?
text: Morgan THROWS THEIR PHONES OUT THE WINDOW into the opposite
text: lane. Watches in the rearview as CARS CRUSH THEM.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think my Candy Crush
dialog: progress will be saved?
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah, in the cloud. You linked your
dialog: account with Facebook, right?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: No. I don’t like getting all those
dialog: notifications.
dialog: (mournful )
dialog: Fuck.
scene_heading: I/E. 405 FREEWAY/AUDREY’S HONDA CIVIC - DAY
text: Audrey starts to pull off at an EXIT.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Why are you getting off here?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: To park.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Dude, people are trying to kill us.
dialog: We are not fucking parking in Lot C.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
text: Mid-flight. Audrey and Morgan sit next to each other, eyeing
text: all fellow passengers suspiciously. Wondering who might be a
text: threat. A WELL-DRESSED BUSINESSMAN. A PROFESSORIAL TYPE in a
text: bow-tie. Everyone in between. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT passes.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Could I get a Pinot Grigio please?
text: The Flight Attendant nods and leaves.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You can’t drink right now!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I have to. This is so fucking
dialog: stressful. Like, any of these
dialog: people could be trying to kill us.
text: She makes eye contact with a LITTLE GIRL across the aisle.
text: The little girl stares back stoically. Morgan’s freaked out.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Morgan. We need all our faculties.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (re: her screen)
dialog: That guy just drank like three
dialog: martinis.
text: Reveal she’s watching a BOND MOVIE. Audrey’s watching BOURNE.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: He’s been doing this a really long
dialog: time. This is our first time.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Do you think Drew was a James Bond
dialog: kind of spy?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I don’t know. I don’t think James
dialog: Bond would like, need to try every
text: breakfast burrito in Los Angeles.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Yeah. Seems more like a Bourne thing.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Are your parents gonna be pissed
dialog: that we used their credit card?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Not if I tell them why. That’s our
dialog: family policy. As long as I tell
dialog: the truth, they can’t get mad.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Morgan. You can’t tell them the
dialog: truth about this.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (deeply conflicted)
dialog: What if I tell them we went to
dialog: Europe to go to museums?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You just said you weren’t supposed
dialog: to lie!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: It won't be a lie if we go toa
dialog: museum.
dialog: (off Audrey’s look)
dialog: As long as we're there! We drop off
dialog: the trophy at this cafe, that’s like
dialog: an hour, tops. And then one museum.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We'll play it by ear.
text: The wine arrives. Morgan gulps it down. Audrey shakes her
text: head and puts on her headphones, focusing on her movie.
text: ANGLE ON: BOURNE in a kickass action sequence... and we...

text: Audrey and Drew stand close at the jukebox, scrolling.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh God. That Sarah McLachlan song.
dialog: This is the one in the commercial
dialog: where the dogs are sad, right?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I think the sad dogs redeem the
dialog: song. Ugh, what about Mambo No. 5?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Please. That’s nothing compared to
text: Mambos one through four.
text: Audrey laughs. They’re enjoying each other.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh. Oh my God I have it. Close your
dialog: eyes. Don’t look.
text: Drew closes his eyes. Audrey gleefully puts the quarter in.
text: THE CRASH TEST DUMMIES “MMM MMM MMM MMM” plays. Drew opens

speaker_heading: DREW

scene_heading: I/E. CAB - DAY

speaker_heading: VIENNA, AUSTRIA
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: She hasn’t smiled once. Do you
dialog: think she’s an assassin?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No. We just randomly picked this
dialog: cab. And she’s like, delicate.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Dude. Sexist! Women of all shapes
dialog: and sizes can be anything they want
dialog: to be. They can be assassins...
dialog: (points to themselves)
dialog: They can be operatives.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I wouldn’t say we’re “operatives.”
dialog: This is just one operation.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Yeah. But you and me? We’re always
dialog: operating.
text: Morgan notices something out the window. She GASPS in shock.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AUDREY

dialog: What? What?!?!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: That building is fucking beautiful.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SACHER CAFE - DAY

text: subtly checking everyone out as they eat SACHERTORTES.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Okay. Who do we think Verne is?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I don’t know. It’s kind of a frumpy
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You think? We might just be
dialog: pronouncing it frumpy. Like, Jules
dialog: Verne wasn’t frumpy.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I beg to differ. And wait, won't
dialog: this guy be looking for Drew?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yes. Shit. He will.
text: A beat as they scan... then Morgan suddenly TENSES UP.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: What? What do you see?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Nothing...
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Okay, I know being here right now
dialog: is really important but this cake
dialog: is a lot of flour and dairy for me
dialog: and... I need to go have diarrhea.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s just a biological fact. No

dialog: high the stakes in a given moment,
dialog: sometimes you have to-
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh my God just go.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Thank you. I'll be right back.
text: Morgan rushes toward the bathroom. We stay with Audrey as a
text: BUTCH WAITRESS approaches.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (0.S.)
dialog: Zwei Kaffee, bitte.
text: Before Audrey knows what’s happening, SEBASTIAN emerges from
text: behind her, takes Morgan’s seat. Audrey’s about to SCREAM --
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t scream. I’m the person you’re
dialog: here to see.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: You're Verne?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It’s an alias.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Hand it over.
text: Audrey hedges.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: If Drew wanted me to give this to
dialog: you, why wouldn’t he have done it
dialog: himself?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It’s a long story.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m not in a rush.
text: Then something touches her leg under the table. A GUN.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God!
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Don’t make any noise. Just hand it
dialog: over. I’m not gonna hurt you. I’m
dialog: trying to protect you.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Like you protected Drew?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: That wasn’t us. We didn’t do that.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: If you were really protecting me,
dialog: you wouldn't be pointing a gun at
dialog: me. I may not be in the fucking CIA
dialog: but I know that.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I’m MI-6, actually.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Whatever.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SACHER CAFE, BATHROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: VERNE
dialog: Guttentag!
text: Morgan rushes out of the bathroom, back to --
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SACHER CAFE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Morgan FREEZES, seeing Sebastian at the table with Audrey.
text: She waves -- tries to get Audrey’s attention. Audrey sees her
text: but doesn’t react. The gun’s still trained on her.
text: AT THEIR TABLE -- Sebastian continues to explain.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I’m only pointing this at you so
dialog: you sit still and listen. Ina
dialog: minute, everyone in this cafe is
dialog: going to start shooting. If you
dialog: run, you'll be killed. And even if
dialog: you manage to get out alive, you

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)

dialog: the face. So hand me what I want
text: and no one gets hurt.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Except for Drew.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Okay, it’s not productive to keep
dialog: bringing that up.
text: Audrey has no choice. She reaches into her POCKET and grabs

text: Morgan -- seeing this -- SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
scene_heading: THAT’S. NOT. VERNE!
text: CHAOS ERUPTS! Almost everyone in the cafe has a gun, and most
text: of them start SHOOTING. Sebastian whips around, SHOOTS BACK.
text: A DEAD ASSASSIN plummets into an elaborate ROAST CHICKEN.
text: A DEAD VERNE FALLS ON TOP OF AUDREY, GUN in her dead hand.
text: Morgan drops to the ground, hides under a TABLE... thinking
text: fast, Audrey GRABS Verne’s GUN. Crouching, scans for Morgan --
text: just as -- an ARYAN-LOOKING MAN with a RIFLE stalks Morgan,
text: prepares to end her short, wonderful life...
text: Audrey acts on instinct, aims with precision -- just like
text: Duck Hunt -- and BLOWS THE GUY’S BRAINS OUT. Saving her.
text: Morgan looks up, shocked, grateful. AUDREY’s surprised too.
text: She stares at the gun in her hands -- SHE’S GOOD AT THIS.
text: Then a GUTTURAL SCREAM from behind them-- Sebastian throws
text: SCALDING HOT COFFEE on an attacker, stabs a FORK in his neck.
text: While he’s distracted, Audrey and Morgan fucking run for it.
scene_heading: EXT. VIENNA STREET - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: MORGAN

scene_heading: EXT. VIENNA ALLEY - SAME

speaker_heading: AUDREY

speaker_heading: LUKAS
dialog: You have enough air back there?
text: A GUY ON A MOTORCYCLE PULLS ALONGSIDE THEM -- full-head helmet

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Here’s the deal, okay? Some guys
dialog: with guns are trying to kill us
dialog: right now. Can you just, lose them?
speaker_heading: LUKAS
dialog: (lighting up)

text: Lukas starts driving like a MANIAC. EFFECTIVELY. He makes a

speaker_heading: LUKAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Good thing I smoked a little meth
dialog: before. Fear is an illusion!
text: He turns down a ONE-WAY STREET. The wrong way. CARS HONK,
text: pull to the side. Lukas swerves in and out... on to nearby
text: TRAIN TRACKS. He drives down the tracks at top speed...
dialog: 34.
text: bumping wildly... heads into a NARROW TUNNEL. In the dark,
text: the lights of an ONCOMING TRAIN appear...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Lukas!
speaker_heading: LUKAS
dialog: I see it. No problem.
text: Lukas SPEEDS UP. The girls SCREAM at the top of their

text: JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME -- The TRAIN rushes by.
speaker_heading: LUKAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Up here!
text: Lukas lifts a hand to HIGH-FIVE. Before they can return it--
text: BLAM! -- BLAM!! THE BACK WINDOW shatters! THE GIRLS -- duck!

text: MORGAN lifts her head cautiously over the back seat... FIVE
text: MORE MOTORCYCLE GUYS are racing through the tunnel, armed --
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Audrey, get on top of him!
text: Audrey jumps on the LAP of Lukas’s DECIMATED CORPSE. She
text: DRIVES, cautious at first... then gets an ADRENALINE RUSH.
text: Drives FASTER AND FASTER. When she gets to a CROSSING, she
text: TURNS off the tracks, into TRAFFIC -- Weaving between cars.
text: Audrey is a quick fucking study. She makes a SHARP TURN.
text: Loses her pursuers. For now.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! Pull over! Stop the car!
scene_heading: A BAROQUE SIGN AHEAD -- STEPHANSPLATZ. METRO STATION. Audrey

scene_heading: INT. VIENNA METRO - SAME

speaker_heading: PATEL

speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Audrey Stockman. 27. Works at

dialog: (to Sebastian)
dialog: You're right. Can’t let anything

dialog: (to Wendy)
dialog: She’s worked there since she
dialog: graduated from Oberlin with a B
dialog: minus average. Which is where she
dialog: met this genius...

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: She literally minored in

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What’s your point, Patel? You’re
dialog: okay letting two innocent women die?
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: I think society is okay letting

speaker_heading: AUDREY

speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Wait. Fuck. Our passports.
dialog: Sebastian said we'll get stopped if

speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Okay. So we just have to get new
dialog: ones. Let’s find a couple of girls
dialog: who look like us, tell them what
dialog: happened and convince them to give
dialog: us theirs. They can just go to the

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Who would do that for us?

speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Any girls! It’s girl code. Eat Pray

scene_heading: INT. TRAIN STATION BENCH - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: ... Just think about the only guy
dialog: you've ever really loved dying in
dialog: front of you. And asking you to do
dialog: this one thing for him. Wouldn’t
dialog: you sacrifice anything?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Yeah, I mean this was my favorite
dialog: shirt. It’s H&M but now it’s also
dialog: B&B. Blood and Brains.
scene_heading: AUSSIE TOURIST 1
dialog: You guys are weird.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: We're not...
dialog: (mocking Australian accent)
dialog: weeeeeid. We're serious. You’d be

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Please guys. Just go to the embassy

scene_heading: INT. MILAN PALAZZO - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MILAN, ITALY
text: We track one MODEL -- 6’3, deathly pale, beauty that only
text: exists in unpronounceable countries. NADEJDA (pronounced
dialog: “Nadia” but everything, including spelling, is harder where
text: she’s from.) She completes her walk and heads back to --
scene_heading: INT. MILAN PALAZZO BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The bullpen. Nadedja ignores the chatter of models and

speaker_heading: NADEDJA
dialog: Hello... Yes... I understand.
text: She crosses behind a CURTAIN, pulls it shut.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING AREA - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: MALE INTERN (0.S.)
dialog: Nadedja? You’re not changing, are

dialog: there.
text: Nadedja continues, unperturbed by the request. Moves on to a

text: The curtain is YANKED OPEN, revealing the CHUBBY MALE INTERN.
speaker_heading: MALE INTERN (CONT’D)
dialog: Carlos said now -- HOLY SHIT.
text: His eyes widen, taking in the nudity -- luckier than he’s
dialog: ever been in his life. And ever will be. Because he’s about
dialog: to die. He should not have seen those guns.
text: Nadedja moves like lightning -- AIMS, FIRES. Intern FALLS.
text: She pulls a shapeless FROCK from a nearby rack, checks her
text: reflection in a mirror. Uses a MAKEUP SPONGE to wipe the
text: Intern’s blood off her face, steps over him in her stilettos.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF MILAN - DAY
text: Nadedja climbs into a MERCEDES SLR MACLAREN -- mirrored

scene_heading: I/E. TRAIN - DAY

speaker_heading: AUDREY

speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
text: People shot at us. And each other.

dialog: Then it’s just... not on us.
text: Audrey thinks about it. Tempting, but she just can’t.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No. If it’s really that important
dialog: and we just ditch it and something
dialog: really bad happens... I don’t want

dialog: to the literal blood that’s already
dialog: all over my hands.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: That train station hand soap is for
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We just have to get out of this

speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AUDREY

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I don’t know. Like my best friend
dialog: always knew she wanted to be an
dialog: actress. And she’s just... a natural
dialog: at it. I’ve never had anything like

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You will.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: How do you know? You just met me.
speaker_heading: DREW

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Wait. I just thought of something.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: What?
text: Audrey picks up the TROPHY. BASHES IT against the armrest.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?! What if that’s

speaker_heading: AUDREY

text: Sure enough, the trophy CRACKS. There’s a FLASH DRIVE inside.
speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: But we don’t have our laptops. And

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: They might get mad this time.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: They didn’t get mad when I tried
dialog: cocaine with our rabbi. They didn’t

text: The uncle humor relaxes them a bit. Roger leads the way
text: upstairs - but the girls linger, glancing at the door.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Mind if I lock the door... ?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Nervous traveler, eh?
dialog: (she nods)
dialog: Come on. Let’s go help you relax.
text: He WINKS as he locks the bolt. The girls cringe a little. Ew.
scene_heading: INT. ROGER’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: At a candlelit table, Audrey and Morgan serve themselves
text: salad. Roger enters from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: You girls look like you’d enjoy
dialog: some pot...
text: He pulls a POT ROAST off the counter.
speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Roast!
text: He cracks himself up.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Thank you so much, Roger, I’m
dialog: starving.
dialog: 50.
text: Audrey serves herself some but Morgan wrinkles her nose.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Oooh. Uh... I’m sort of vegan.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Oh. I wish I’d known...
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: It’s kind of a new thing.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Except when she gets really drunk
text: and eats bacon-wrapped hot dogs off
dialog: this gross cart.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Drunk Morgan doesn’t have the same
dialog: ethics as sober Morgan.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Roger, this is delicious. You’re a
dialog: great cook.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Morgan, I can’t let you eat salad
dialog: for dinner. What kind of host would
dialog: I be? I’11l just whip something up.
text: He ducks back into the kitchen. A moment.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Am I crazy or is Roger into me?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh God.
text: Audrey clutches her stomach.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I’m eating too fast. All
dialog: this meat is hitting me weird.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: That’s your body questioning your
dialog: moral decisions.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m gonna find the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Audrey, pale, clutching her stomach, races into the bathroom
text: and THROWS UP in the toilet.
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Roger re-emerges with a dish of GRILLED EGGPLANT.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Here. Eat.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: You know what? I’m good. I’m trying
dialog: not to eat when I’m not hungry.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: What happened to Audrey?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: She went to the bathroom. But I
dialog: think she’s done.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Then let’s retire to the living
dialog: room, shall we?
text: Morgan smiles politely and follows, but she’s skeeved out.
scene_heading: INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Audrey wretches again. IN HER POV... The room is SPINNING.
scene_heading: INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Roger and Morgan stand before an intense EGON SCHIELE NUDE.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: You like art?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
text: She doesn’t look like she’s
text: enjoying herself.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Sometimes the sweetest pleasure
dialog: comes when you’re not enjoying
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I don’t think I agree with that.
text: And then Roger PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HER. Morgan stiffens.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh, hey Roger? You’re so nice and
dialog: my dad says great things about you
dialog: and everything you did with those
dialog: refugees’ eyes... but...
text: He squeezes Morgan’s shoulder harder.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow. That hurts, actually. Can you --
text: She realizes Roger’s hands are drifting up to her NECK.
text: Before Morgan can stop him, he’s SHOVED HER TO THE GROUND.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Aaaaaah! Help!
text: She kicks Roger in the BALLS.
speaker_heading: ROGER MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow! Fuck! Audrey!
text: Roger climbs on top of Morgan.
scene_heading: INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - BATHROOM- SAME
text: Still in Audrey’s POV. Morgan’s yelling is muffled. Audrey
text: tries to stand -- but loses her balance. She falls into --
text: THE SHOWER.
text: THERE’S A DEAD BODY IN THE TUB. A different BALD NERD. THE
text: REAL ROGER. Audrey flails to get off him. It’s tough. She’s
text: been drugged. She COLLAPSES to the floor, barely conscious.
scene_heading: INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME
text: Roger, on top of a screaming Morgan, yanks up the side of her
text: shirt and injects her with a TRANQUILIZER.
scene_heading: INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Roger tosses a WOOZY MORGAN into the bathroom with Audrey,
text: slams the door. The girls are barely lucid.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Audrey... Roger drugged me...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That’s not Roger.
text: Audrey pulls back the shower curtain, reveals the body.
text: Morgan gasps. Audrey pulls out the flash drive.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to swallow this.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So they can’t find it. Come on!
dialog: Before he comes back!
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: You swallow it.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I just puked like nine times. I’11
dialog: just throw it back up.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I can’t even swallow Advil! I have
dialog: to mash it up and put it in
dialog: Applesauce... that thing is huge.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Pretend it’s that homeless guy.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (fading)
dialog: Dude. I didn’t know...
text: Audrey musters the strength to lift Morgan’s head to the
text: sink. She runs the water into Morgan’s mouth, putting the
text: FLASH DRIVE IN. Morgan tries to swallow... but coughs it up.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Lift your head back. Hold your nose.
text: Morgan tries holding her nose and dangling the flash drive
text: into her mouth. It goes in... and Morgan starts CHOKING.
text: Audrey SLAPS her on the back. The flash drive flies out.
text: Audrey, passing out, picks up the flash drive, thinking fast--
text: THE DOOR flies open just AS THE TOILET FLUSHES. “Roger” is
text: flanked by THREE THUGS. IN THE GIRLS’ POV, we FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: The girls come to -- finding their hands are CHAINED TO PIPES
text: above their heads. They’re in an old, rusted out locker room.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Audrey?
text: They’re not alone. A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE sits by the SHOWERS.
text: Audrey squints at them -- recognizes them -- gasps!
text: IT’S DREW'S PARENTS. TOM and MARSHA are typical Midwesterner
text: parents -- greying, thick, Patagonias. They look exhausted.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh my God. Tom! Marsha!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Who?
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Drew’s parents.
dialog: (to Tom and Marsha)
dialog: Oh God. Am I the reason you got
dialog: dragged into this? Believe me, I
dialog: never meant for of this to happen.
dialog: I never meant for Drew to die...
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Help us get these off before they
dialog: come back and chain you up too...
text: Marsha nods sweetly, crosses slowly to Audrey and... PUNCHES
text: HER HARD ACROSS THE FACE.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Ahhhhhh! What the --
text: Marsha speaks... with a HEAVY RUSSIAN ACCENT.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Shut up, you dumb bitch.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Where’s the drive?
text: He has an accent too. He approaches Morgan, pulling a KNIFE.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: You guys are in on this too.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Tell your friend to answer my
dialog: fucking question.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Trust me. Your son would have
dialog: wanted you to protect us.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Uh, Audrey. I don’t think those are
dialog: really Drew’s parents.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yes they are! Right?
dialog: (to Tom and Marsha)
dialog: That dinner happened. We split the
dialog: chicken lettuce wraps. We talked
dialog: about Tom’s colonoscopy. We both
dialog: love Scandal, Marsha! I was team
dialog: Fitz, you were team Jake! Jake’s
dialog: the good guy! Scott Foley!
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: I can like Scott Foley and be a
dialog: Russian operative who is not Drew’s
dialog: mother. Drew worked for us.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Where’s the fucking drive?!
text: He holds the KNIFE to Audrey’s throat. A long beat.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I... flushed it down the toilet.
dialog: Silence. This is a big fucking deal.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Do you know what you’ve done?
text: He glares at them. It’s a scary fucking look.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Nadedja!
text: NADEDJA enters, now wearing a FORM-FITTING LEATHER SUIT.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Shoot these cunts in the head.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Torture them first. Make sure
dialog: they’re not lying.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We’re not! We have no reason to
dialog: lie! We don’t even know what’s on
dialog: that drive! No one ever told us!
text: They leave the girls with Nadedja. She UNZIPS her CASE --
text: lays out a bunch of fucked up looking DENTAL EQUIPMENT.
text: Audrey starts shaking. Morgan nervously starts rambling...
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: You're really pretty. Like you’re
dialog: barely human you’re so pretty --
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Morgan, shut up.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: No! Everybody likes compliments!
text: NADEDJA removes a pair of PLIERS. Approaches Morgan.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow! Did you sharpen that yourself?
dialog: Do you work with metal often?
dialog: 56.
text: Nadia brings the PLIERS closer.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D) AUDREY

scene_heading: I/E BLACK SUV - SAME
text: Patel drives the lead car. Sebastian sits shotgun.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA, BELGIUM - DAY
text: A long-abandoned, run down ICE HOCKEY RINK from the 70s.
text: That’s where the girls are being held.
text: On the ROOF -- the parents and some THUGS load gear into a
text: whirring HELICOPTER. ANGLE ON the DECAL on the chopper --
dialog: VOLVO. (Did you know Volvo made choppers? Apparently they do
dialog: for assassins posing as Midwestern parents)
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: Nadedja nears Audrey’s mouth with the pliers...
speaker_heading: NADEDJA
dialog: I ask question. If I don’t like
dialog: answer, I take tooth. Same as her.
text: A SOB. We reveal Morgan -- BLOOD is pouring from her mouth.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: That was a fucking wisdom tooth! It
dialog: was all the way up in there.
speaker_heading: NADEDJA
dialog: Where is the drive?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I already told them. I flushed it
text: down the toilet.
speaker_heading: NADEDJA
dialog: I don’t like answer.
text: She takes the PLIERS to one of Audrey’s FRONT TEETH.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: This is so bad for women!
text: Nadedja brutally TWISTS AUDREY’S TOOTH. Audrey GASPS in pain.
dialog: 57.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA - DAY
text: THE SUVs pull up just in time to see the CHOPPER LEAVING.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK SUV - DAY- CONTINUOUS
text: Patel and Sebastian watch as the chopper retreats.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Fuck. They got the drive.
dialog: (into a handset)
dialog: Okay kids. On my order, scuttle the
dialog: F-15s. Let’s blow this shithole up.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Wait. The girls could be in there.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: If they are, they’re either dead or
dialog: surrounded by terrorists. Also: I
dialog: don’t care.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Just give me five minutes and three
dialog: agents. I want to check.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: So four agents can get killed? I
dialog: can’t authorize that. And this is
dialog: my operation.
speaker_heading: THE RADIO (V.O.)
text: F-15s are a minute out.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Sweet. Let’s crush this mother like
dialog: we've crushed Yale in every
dialog: football game since 2007.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: By “we” I mean Harvard.
text: Sebastian makes a snap decision. He SLAMS PATEL’S HEAD INTO
text: THE STEERING WHEEL, knocking him out. Sebastian seizes his
dialog: RADIO. Does his best Patel impression:
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Actually guys, hold up? Abort
dialog: mission.
speaker_heading: THE RADIO (V.O.)
dialog: Roger that.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Go Crimson.
text: He HANDCUFFS Patel to the steering wheel.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA - MOMENTS LATER
text: Sebastian, HANDGUN up, creeps along the side of the building.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA - CONTINUOUS
text: A GUARD on the other side of the door with a RIFLE.
text: Sebastian leaps out of nowhere -- KICKS HIM IN THE FACE -- we
text: see his training in action. The Guard’s rifle CLANGS to the
text: ground. Sebastian STOMPS on his fallen body. He’s out.
text: THROUGH ANOTHER SET OF DOORS
text: Sebastian peeks out -- moves quietly -- hiding under a
text: BLEACHER. Takes in the cavernous HOCKEY RINK.
text: Rats scuttle across DIRT where the ICE used to be. A MASSIVE
text: DECREPIT ZAMBONI in the corner. A moldy old HOCKEY GOAL.
text: In the shadows, creepy THUGS stalk, on patrol.
text: A muffled SCREAM from across the rink. Sebastian spots the
text: locker room door on the far side. Knows they’re in there.
text: FLICK! A RUSSIAN GUARD lights a cigarette inches from
text: Sebastian -- doesn’t see him. He takes a drag, enjoying it.
text: He’d better - it’ll be his last ever. He walks a couple
text: paces, around the ZAMBONI --
text: Sebastian’s waiting. In one fluid move, he has the guard in a
text: headlock -- shoves the lit cigarette into his mouth -- holds
text: it closed as the guard burns from the inside. Then crumples.
text: Sebastian drops him -- runs swiftly, unseen, under the rink-
text: side barriers. Stops a few yards from the LOCKER ROOM...
text: A CARD TABLE stands in the way. NINE BAD FUCKING GUYS around
text: it. All with guns on them. Eating, drinking, laughing.
text: Sebastian silently checks his clip. He wouldn’t have enough
dialog: bullets for all of them even if every shot was perfect. Fuck.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: Blood is now streaming out of both the girls’ mouths.
text: Nadedja smiles for the first time -- albeit sadistically --
text: as she pulls out JUMPER CABLES attached to a CAR BATTERY.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m telling you we don’t know
dialog: anything!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I’ve never kept a secret in my
dialog: life! I tell everyone everything!
dialog: 59.
text: Nadedja just hits the jumpers together. SPARKS fly.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I have herpes!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Proving to her that I’m honest and
dialog: have nothing to hide! I stole my
dialog: dad's painkillers from his hernia
dialog: surgery and sold them at Coachella!
text: Nadedja approaches Morgan with the jumpers...
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I text while I drive -- drunk --
dialog: all the time! I once made out with
dialog: this guy who has a hormone disorder
text: where he looks twelve. He’s
dialog: actually forty, but still! It’s
dialog: like I hooked up with a child!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Morgan. This is not helping--
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Tell her something personal about
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
text: Audrey has a recurring sex dream
dialog: about Turtle from Entourage!
text: Nadedja SHOCKS MORGAN. Morgan SCREAMS. Blinding pain.
scene_heading: I/E. BLACK SUV - DAY
text: Patel stirs awake -- groggily realizes what happened. Then
text: realizes his hand is CUFFED.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: You fucking dick, Henshaw.
text: Fuming, he reaches down with his free arm, manages to grab
text: the WIRE to his mouthpiece. Talks into it.
speaker_heading: PATEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay! Send the F-15s.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA - DAY
text: SEBASTIAN HEARS THIS...
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: PATEL (V.O.)
dialog: Drop the payload. Now.
text: SEBASTIAN knows he has to move. Now.
scene_heading: THE ZAMBONI -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Sebastian sits astride the beast. There’s no way this thing
dialog: still works, right? No fucking way. But he has to try. He
text: turns the IGNITION. It burps awake. Fucking miracle.
text: AT THE CARD TABLE
text: The thugs are confused. What the fuck is that? THE ZAMBONI
text: ROARS AHEAD -- NOW ON TOP OF THEM.
text: SEBASTIAN drives. One moment the table was full of scary
text: dudes. Now a THREE TON hunk of metal and giant spinning
text: blades SHRED the life out of every one of them.
text: Someone’s SEVERED HAND flies into the HOCKEY GOAL.
text: Sebastian doesn’t have time to be impressed with himself -- A
text: GIANT MAN pulls him out of his seat.
text: No actually, a straight up HULK -- pulls him to the ground.
text: Stands over him. This guy is the biggest monster Russia has
text: ever created and he’s about to crush Sebastian.
text: Sebastian KICKS. Gets him in the shin. This is nothing to
text: him. Hulk leans down, takes Sebastian’s left arm. SNAPS IT.
text: Blinding pain. Then Hulk SHOOTS him in the OTHER SHOULDER.
text: Sebastian writhes in agony as the thug points his gun at
text: Sebastian’s head. So much for playing hero. He’s gonna die.
text: One last ditch thought -- Sebastian grabs for his gun. With
text: two fucked up arms, he can’t AIM so he just SHOOTS WILDLY.
text: WHEREVER HE CAN. Hulk laughs. Bullets nowhere near him, but --
text: ONE BULLET ricochets around the rafters, hits a CHAIN. Which
text: holds -- AN ANCIENT SCOREBOARD. The scoreboard FALLS, right
text: on the Hulk. CRUSHES his SKULL.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: Hearing the LOUD NOISE, Nadedja turns. What was that?
text: A momentary reprieve for Morgan and Audrey as she grabs two
text: guns and heads toward the noise...
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM - SAME
text: Sebastian crouches under the bleachers as NADEDJA’S HIGH
text: HEELS pass. Once she’s gone -- he crawls to the locker room.
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Sebastian enters and GASPS.
text: Audrey and Morgan look horrible. But they’re alive. Seeing
text: him, they start collapsing in sobs -- but there’s no time --
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: We have to move fast.
text: Sebastian struggles to lift Audrey -- unhooks her from the
text: pipe she hangs from. Not easy given his own injuries...
text: Audrey unhooks Morgan. They hurry toward the BACK EXIT--
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA - DAY
text: A bloody, hobbled Audrey, Morgan and Sebastian hurry out of
text: the arena into the sunlight. The girls stop.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Where are we -- ?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Keep moving! Go! Go!
text: The F-15s buzz over the ARENA. DROP THEIR PAYLOAD.
text: Sebastian pulls them away as fast as he can as the building --
text: EXPLODES. A fiery boom. Then just a fire.
text: The old rink is now a HEAP of RUBBLE along with everyone
text: inside. At least they’re safe. Sebastian crouches over the
text: girls, shielding them from the debris. As the smoke clears:
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Okay. I trust you now.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Jesus, I should hope so.
text: But when the smoke clears... there are FIFTY SPECIAL FORCES
text: AGENTS surrounding them. Guns drawn. Oh shit.
scene_heading: INT. CIA PARIS STATION, HOLDING CELL - DAY
text: Sebastian -- one arm bandaged, one in a SLING -- sits with
text: the girls in a holding room.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Be honest. Does this look fake?
text: She smiles. An UNNATURALLY WHITE FAKE TOOTH where hers was.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: You know I would never lie to you.
dialog: 62.
text: Morgan leaves it at that. Audrey turns to Sebastian.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I should have just given you the
dialog: drive in the cafe. Then none of
dialog: this would have happened.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I wouldn’t have believed me either.
dialog: Drew told you to keep it safe.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Okay. Can you just tell us what is
dialog: on that fucking drive?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I actually don’t know. What I know
dialog: is it was made by an international
dialog: terrorist group called Highland.
dialog: Intelligence tells us they’re
dialog: planning a series of
dialog: assassinations. High profile
dialog: people. The plans will be on that
dialog: drive. So if we had it, we’d know
dialog: how to stop them.
text: Audrey is about to say something when --
text: THE DOOR OPENS. WENDY enters with PATEL -- his nose broken
text: and bandaged.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Henshaw? My office. Patel, stay
dialog: here.
text: Sebastian glances back at the girls, then follows Wendy out.
text: In their wake, PATEL is alone with the girls. Awkwardly:
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What happened to your nose?
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Your new best friend slammed my
text: head into a steering wheel so he
dialog: could put our entire team at risk.
dialog: In order to save you.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh.
text: An awkward silence.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: So, “Patel.” Do you know a Danny
dialog: Patel who went to Wesleyan?
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: INT. CIA PARIS STATION - WENDY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Wendy coldly sits across from Sebastian.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Henshaw, you read English at
dialog: university. Did you ever learn the
dialog: word “hierarchy”?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Wendy, I know I --
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: How about the word “treason”?
dialog: That’s a good one. Love when it
text: comes up in the crossword.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I know I overstepped --
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Overstepped? Overstepping is
text: wearing a tank top on Casual
dialog: Friday. Overstepping is stealing my
text: Activia from the office fridge even
dialog: though I brought it from home.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I didn’t steal your Activia.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Goddammit. We work for an
dialog: international intelligence
dialog: organization and I can't figure out
dialog: who’s been eating my yogurt. My
dialog: point is you did a lot more than
dialog: overstep. You violated my direct
dialog: orders, handcuffed your superior
text: and went into a building swarming
text: with terrorists without backup.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I know. I exercised poor judgment --
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Which one of them is it?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: The only reason I can fathom why
dialog: you'd put the entire mission on the
dialog: line to save two girls’ lives is
dialog: you're in love with one of them. So
dialog: which one is it?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: The one with the tooth or the one
dialog: who invited me to see her in Pippin
dialog: at the Santa Monica Playhouse?
scene_heading: INT. CIA PARIS STATION HOLDING CELL - LATER
text: PATEL paces the room, enjoying this. The girls are upset.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: So what was going through your mind
dialog: exactly when you flushed it down
dialog: the toilet? “This thing is so
dialog: important that actual people are
dialog: actually dying because of it. So I
dialog: know what I’11 do! I’1l treat it
dialog: like a piece of shit wrapped ina
dialog: piece of toilet paper.”
text: Morgan involuntarily LAUGHS. Claps a hand over her mouth.
speaker_heading: PATEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is funny? Death is funny to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: No, just... that’s how you go to
dialog: the bathroom?
text: Audrey starts quietly laughing too.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Go ahead. Laugh. Meanwhile, I'11
dialog: tell you how many lives were lost
dialog: and will be lost because of you.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: ...So let me get this straight. You
dialog: take a piece of toilet paper and
dialog: what? You like wrap your hands in
text: it and then poop into it, and then
dialog: take that whole contraption and
dialog: that’s what you drop into the
dialog: toilet? You know the toilet is
dialog: designed to take all that work out
dialog: of it for you?
scene_heading: INT. CIA PARIS STATION. WENDY’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Wendy and Sebastian, as before.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: How long did the doctor say it
dialog: would take your arm to heal?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Two months for the bullet wound.
dialog: Three for the fracture.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Great. Take a five month leave.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Oh, I assume he meant the two arms
dialog: will heal simultaneously.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I know what I said.
scene_heading: INT. CIA PARIS STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY
text: Patel is in the middle of berating the girls. He leans in.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: And every time you hear the song
dialog: that will be recorded by Sting
dialog: (featuring Bruno Mars) about
dialog: everyone who’s about to be killed,
dialog: just know that that song would
dialog: never have had to be made if you
dialog: two weren’t such fuck-ups.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Okay. We get it.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Oh, sorry, have you had enough?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Drew was right about you.
text: Audrey FLINCHES. Patel savors this.
speaker_heading: PATEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're nothing to him. Just a place
dialog: for him to put his stuff. Because
dialog: no one would ever suspect you of
dialog: anything. No one would ever think
dialog: you were important enough.
text: This hangs in the air for Audrey. The door opens and
text: SEBASTIAN re-enters. Avoids Patel, addresses the girls.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I just wanted to say goodbye.
dialog: You're on the next flight to LA.
speaker_heading: MORGAN

dialog: we gonna go to jail?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No, we’ll take care of it. That’s
dialog: what we do here.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Actually Henshaw, not to be a
dialog: grammarian here but you’re not
dialog: technically included in “we”
dialog: anymore when referring to what we
dialog: do here. Since you’re suspended.
text: Sebastian seethes but doesn’t say anything.
speaker_heading: PATEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Now how about you drop these two at
dialog: the airport on your way home? Good
dialog: practice for your next career
text: driving a SuperShuttle.
scene_heading: I/E. TOYOTA COROLLA - DAY
text: Sebastian drives his modest car out of the parking garage.
text: Audrey sits shotgun, Morgan in the back.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sorry about all the dog hair back
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I’m surprised they don’t give you
text: more of a badass James Bond car.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I don’t have company car privileges
dialog: right now. Or for the next five
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Ugh. We ruined your life.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No you didn’t. I’1l be fine. And I
dialog: don’t know what Patel said to you
dialog: in there but this situation would
dialog: be much worse if you hadn’t flushed
dialog: that drive and it ended up in the
dialog: wrong hands.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: But a lot of people are gonna die.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: And they would have died if you'd
dialog: never found the drive in the first
dialog: place. This is not your fault.
text: A moment.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Just out of curiosity, if we did
dialog: still have the drive, what would
dialog: have happened?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Well, hopefully we could de-encrypt
dialog: it. Then ideally, we’d see what
text: Highland’s plans are and stop them.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: How do you de-encrypt something?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Why do you want to know?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (a nervous beat)
dialog: Because the drive is in my vagina.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah...
text: Sebastian and Morgan are SHOCKED.
dialog: Wait.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN MORGAN
dialog: Are you fucking kidding?!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You told me it was important! I’m
dialog: not going to flush something that
dialog: important down the toilet!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: So it’s in there right now? Doesn’t
dialog: that hurt?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You get used to it.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: So even when you were being
dialog: tortured... you didn’t give it up.
text: Sebastian is really impressed with Audrey.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: The ultimate irony would be if you
dialog: saved the world, then died of Toxic
dialog: Shock Syndrome.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Right then, not to be impolite but
dialog: do you think you might... access
dialog: it? From... the place where--
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah. Everyone turn your head.
text: ANGLE on AUDREY’S FACE as she unzips, removes the flash
text: drive. A moment, then another ZIP. She holds out the drive.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Should I just put it...
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Uh, I’11 take that.
text: An awkward -- and extremely intimate -- moment as Audrey
text: hands the drive to Sebastian. He puts it on the dash, then
text: turns off at an exit for CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Where are you going after this?
dialog: Back to headquarters or whatever?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah. I’m sure they’1l un-suspend
dialog: you if you show up with this.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Maybe. But I may try to take this
dialog: one on myself.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: How? Look at you. You're like,
text: disabled right now.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I'll figure something out.
text: A moment. Audrey and Morgan exchange a look.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Dude, no. I’m not gonna sit on the
text: plane watching Cake Boss while
dialog: you're risking your life to clean
dialog: up a mess we made. I want to help.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Me too. You can’t do this alone.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No. No. You two have risked your
dialog: lives enough as it is.
text: A moment. Then the other part of the truth comes out.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: But... I don’t want to go back yet.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Me neither. This might sound stupid
dialog: because this is your job and it's
dialog: really serious and dangerous, but I
dialog: feel like this is something we
dialog: could actually be... good at.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I know. This is everything I love
dialog: about theater and I’m finally
dialog: getting to do it. Just pretending
dialog: to be a spy.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You're not pretending.
text: Sebastian DOES AN AGGRESSIVE U-TURN. New plan.
scene_heading: EXT. BIBLIOTHEQUE MAZARINE - DAY
text: A gorgeous historical library on the Seine facing the LOUVRE.
scene_heading: INT. BIBLIOTHEQUE MAZARINE - DAY
text: Breathtaking details, centuries-old books. A tourist
dialog: destination. But these are no ordinary tourists.
text: The READING ROOM -- Sebastian inserts the FLASH DRIVE into
text: his laptop while the girls look on. The same ENCRYPTED
text: numbers and letters that appeared in the Apple Store pop up.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Hmmmm. That’s odd.
text: He LOOKS DOWN AT THE DRIVE. Then back at Audrey. Then back at
text: the DRIVE. Audrey gets paranoid about what he’s judging.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Whatever dude. Not every woman is
dialog: like, a waxed porn star. We have
text: stuff going on in there.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No, no. I mean on the drive... this
dialog: is State Department encryption.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Highland didn’t make this. Your
dialog: government did. I can’t access it. I
dialog: don’t have clearance. I’m suspended.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: can’t you just hack the password?
dialog: You're a spy.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: They change it every 24 hours. It’s
dialog: 16 characters. Numbers, letters,
dialog: case-sensitive. Even if I hada
dialog: supercomputer, it would take days.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So... what are you saying?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: We can’t get into the flash drive.
dialog: I’m saying we lost.
text: A sober moment for all of them.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: There must be something else we can
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Not unless you have access to some
dialog: sort of expert on U.S. intelligence
dialog: computer security.
text: Morgan gets an idea.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Actually, hold on.
scene_heading: INT. BIBLIOTHEQUE MAZARINE - NIGHT
text: Two FRENCH STUDENTS absorbed in MATH TEXTBOOKS. Around them,
dialog: the usual student technology -- laptops, mobiles, etc. Morgan

speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Ou est la bibliothéque?
text: They students are confused.
speaker_heading: FRENCH STUDENT
dialog: You're already at the library.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Yeah, sorry, it’s the only thing I
dialog: remember from high school French.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I’m just gonna borrow this for one
dialog: second. Be right back.
text: She grabs one of their MOBILES and steps outside.

scene_heading: INT. MOSCOW HOTEL - DAY- INTERCUT
text: The back of someone’s head, staring out the window at the

speaker_heading: EDWARD SNOWDEN
dialog: This is Edward.
speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s Morgan. From Buck’s Rock Camp.
text: Edward Snowden loses his shit.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Oh my God, Morgan! How are you?
dialog: It’s been forever. I’ve sent you a
dialog: bunch of emails over the years... I
dialog: thought maybe you didn’t have your
dialog: AOL account anymore.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Yeah, I have a Gmail now.
speaker_heading: EDWARD SNOWDEN
dialog: Actually... I knew that.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Right. I guess you would.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So hey. I need a really big favor.
text: A knock at Edward’s hotel room door. A RUSSIAN AIDE appears.
speaker_heading: RUSSIAN AIDE
dialog: Sir, Mr. Putin is ready for you.
speaker_heading: EDWARD SNOWDEN
dialog: He can wait.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: What do you need, Morgan? Anything.
speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: EDWARD SNOWDEN
dialog: Always.
scene_heading: INT. CIA SITUATION ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: CIA TECHNICIAN
dialog: Ma’am! Ma’am.
dialog: (Wendy looks over)
dialog: They didn’t get on their flight.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Shit.
text: She turns to PATEL.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT’D)
dialog: Either those dum-dums took their
text: selfie sticks to the Eiffel Tower
dialog: or they lied about not having the
dialog: drive and they’re on the run. Which
dialog: agent took them to the airport?
text: Patel freezes. He fucked up.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: I, uh, sent Henshaw.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You sent the agent I just suspended
dialog: for insubordination?
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: I'll fix it.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You’d better. Give me an excuse to
dialog: leave couples therapy early. I’m

scene_heading: INT. BIBLIOTHEQUE MAZARINE - DAY
text: Sebastian types in the password Morgan reads off...
speaker_heading: MORGAN
text: ...Two, upper case L, at sign, at

text: ON THE SCREEN: A CHECK MARK.
text: Sebastian and Audrey exchange a look, amazed. Sebastian

scene_heading: INT. BIBLIOTHEQUE MAZARINE - LATER
text: Morgan is now trying desperately to wrap it up with Snowden.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Yeah. Yeah. Totally. I love the
dialog: Mighty Mighty Bosstones too. Makes

dialog: Europe now... I’1l definitely try
dialog: to make it.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: But if I can’t, call me if you’re

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What? What’s on the drive.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: These... aren’t Highland’s plans.
dialog: This is a lot bigger.

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)

scene_heading: INT. EUROPEAN HOTEL ROOM - SUNSET - INTERCUT
text: In a lavish bed in a luxury hotel in Europe somewhere sits --
text: NADEDJA. She’s still alive? What the fuck?
text: Her PROFILE, haunting beauty, lit by the sunset. She’s stone-
text: faced, chain smoking, surrounded by artillery. EURO MTV plays
text: low in the background but she stares out the window. Her CELL
text: buzzes. She answers in CROATIAN.
speaker_heading: NADEDJA
dialog: Zdravo.
text: A VOICE speaks through a VOICE MODULATOR.
speaker_heading: VOICE MODULATOR
dialog: I need to add another target.
speaker_heading: NADEDJA
dialog: Double rate.
speaker_heading: VOICE MODULATOR
dialog: No. You failed once. The girls are
dialog: still alive. You should be happy
dialog: we're still working with you. I’1l
dialog: send you everything you need.
text: We stay on NADEDJA as her A TEXT comes through. A picture of
text: SEBASTIAN. Then, LINK to GOOGLE MAPS with a MOVING DOT.
text: Nadedja turns to assemble her weapons -- and we reveal --
text: HALF HER FACE IS MELTED OFF. Hideously deformed. The bombing
dialog: at the ice rink. Well... she’s survived worse.
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN PARIS SHOPPING CENTRE PARKING LOT - DAY
text: By the parked Corolla, Sebastian switches the SIM CARD in his
text: phone -- opens the TRUNK, pulls out DRY CLEANING.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Here. Change your clothes. We need
dialog: to ditch anything they could use to
dialog: find out where we’re going.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Amsterdam. I know a place we can
dialog: hide.
text: As they all put on Sebastian’s DRESS SHIRTS...
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Oh my God my friend Beth lives in
dialog: Amsterdam! She just emailed me
text: about a new gallery show.
dialog: (to Sebastian)
text: She uses pipe cleaners and glitter
dialog: to discuss draconian abortion
dialog: access in contemporary India.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Interesting. Do you want your

speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I wasn’t saying we should go.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Unless we get this all resolved and
dialog: we're safe. Then I wouldn’t mind
text: supporting her.
text: Meanwhile, Audrey tries not to stare at Sebastian’s body as
text: she helps him button his shirt. Dude’s in great shape. He
text: catches her looking. An awkward moment as they both redden.
text: There’s tension -- and not just the life and death kind.
text: A series of QUICK CUTS, over energetic music --
text: -Morgan THROWS ALL THEIR CLOTHES into a DUMPSTER.
text: -Sebastian pulls a stash of SPY SHIT -- MONEY, PASSPORTS,
text: GUNS, GADGETS, A PACK OF CIGARETTES -- from his glove box...
text: -Sebastian walks Morgan through JIMMYING the lock on another

scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH HIGHWAY - MINUTES LATER

scene_heading: I/E. A PARIS TRAIN - NIGHT
text: NADEDJA in a CLOSED TRAIN CAR -- bad side facing away from
text: us, toward the window. She tracks the moving DOT.
text: KNOCK KNOCK! A sleazy SPANISH GUY slides the door open.
speaker_heading: SPANISH GUY
dialog: Good evening, beautiful.
text: He sits next to her. Nadedja blithely turns, revealing the
text: other side of her face -- now bandaged but SOAKED WITH BLOOD.
speaker_heading: SPANISH GUY (CONT’D)
dialog: Bella, what happened to your face?
text: Nadedja calmly lifts a hand and BASHES HIS NOSE IN. Amused:
speaker_heading: NADEDJA
dialog: What happened to yours?
scene_heading: I/E. SEBASTIAN'S CAR - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
text: Sebastian and Audrey up front, Morgan sleeping in back.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So what kind of dog do you have?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Well, had.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
text: No. No. The dog’s still alive. He
dialog: just lives with my ex.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Do you ever see him?... Or her? Or,
dialog: sorry, maybe they’re both “him,” I
dialog: don’t mean to be presumptuous.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: The dog’s a “he.” The ex is a “she.”
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Got it. What happened?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You know. The usual. I worked too
dialog: much. We never saw each other. She
dialog: was having an emotional affair with
dialog: one of her coworkers. They were
dialog: always hugging. They once hugged
dialog: for five minutes.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Just try to hug someone for five
dialog: minutes. I bet you can’t.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah, that’s a really long time.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Also I found out she was selling
dialog: weapons to the Chinese government.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Where is she now?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Off the grid. I lost track of her --
dialog: and Banjo -- somewhere along the
dialog: Kyrgyzstan border.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m really sorry.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yeah. Breakups suck. As you know.
text: A moment of connection.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: They just make you feel crazy.
dialog: Like, you're with someone for ten
dialog: months, you think you’re in love...
dialog: then you’re like, oh wait, that was
dialog: all a lie. I was just a vagina for
text: him to store a flash drive in.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It’s more complicated than that.
dialog: People reveal who they are in the
dialog: end. It doesn’t mean what you had
dialog: wasn’t real.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Morgan says Drew was always a
dialog: selfish dick.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: And what do you think?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I mean, he did bring assassins to

dialog: did you.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (smiling)

scene_heading: AUSSIE TOURIST 1
dialog: How cute is this jacket?
scene_heading: AUSSIE TOURIST 2

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So Sebastian, is this what your job

speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Uh, no. Mostly it’s a lot of
text: paperwork. Reading reports. Waiting
dialog: to get sent into the field.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: At least you have a field. My field
text: is a conveyor belt with almond milk
dialog: and cruelty-free chicken coming at
dialog: me. Reeeeally slowly. With plenty
dialog: of time for me to intercept them.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I’ve never had a job. But I love
dialog: hearing about jobs. Maybe I should
dialog: get a job here serving pannekoeken.
dialog: I do a really good Dutch accent.
dialog: Audrey knows.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: She played a guard in Diary of Anne
dialog: Frank.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: The part was written as a man but
dialog: at Oberlin we did a Gender-Switch

dialog: On Sebastian -- what the fuck are they talking about?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Speaking of hiding out, where are
dialog: we staying tonight? Do we finally
dialog: get to sleep in a real hotel?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Yeah, like one of those ones in
dialog: Bond where there just happens to be
dialog: a private waterfall for him to have
dialog: sex under?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No. We need to stay somewhere we

text: that girl said. On the news.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I mean, I’m not surprised she said
dialog: that. I haven’t really done
dialog: anything that impressive with my
dialog: life so far.
text: A moment.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I’ve seen you do some pretty
dialog: impressive things. You were a great
dialog: shot in the cafe. You didn’t break
dialog: when you were tortured. You had the
dialog: forethought to put that thing up
dialog: your... thing. You’re a natural at
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Well, I’m impressed with you too.
dialog: Not a lot of people would've cared
dialog: about saving me. Including my ex.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Audrey. About that. I want to clear
dialog: something up. You weren’t just a
dialog: cover for Drew. That much I know.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I was... there the night you two
dialog: met. At your birthday last year.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You were at Barcade?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
text: Outside. In the surveillance van.
dialog: Drew was actually there to take out
dialog: a target.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
text: The bartender. He was in ISIS.
scene_heading: INT. BARCADE - NIGHT( FLASHBACK)
text: A BARTENDER with a VERY LONG BEARD -- could be in Isis, could
text: be in Iron & Wine -- hands DREW a drink at the bar.
speaker_heading: ISIS BARTENDER
dialog: Craft Bourbon Cocktail with tobacco
dialog: bitters and a rhubarb zest?
dialog: 84.
text: We hear Sebastian in V.O. through Drew’s earpiece.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Can you identify him as the target?
text: Drew’s leans back to get a better view, knocking into Audrey
text: at the jukebox. He turns, sees her. Smiles. She’s cute.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It’s okay.
text: From DREW'S SIDE NOW, we see Audrey turn around in her TIARA.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh. Happy birthday.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What?
dialog: (off tiara, deadpan)
dialog: Oh, this? It’s not my birthday. I
dialog: just wear this for warmth.
scene_heading: INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - NIGHT- (FLASHBACK
text: Sebastian sits with TWO OTHER AGENTS, watching FOOTAGE of
text: different areas of the bar. ONSCREEN, Drew and Audrey flirt.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Thayer. We do not have time for
dialog: this.
dialog: (Drew ignores him)
dialog: Thayer. Show me you’re listening to
dialog: me.
dialog: (Drew keeps ignoring him)
dialog: Tell me this earptece is still
dialog: working. Or I’m coming in there.
text: They start dancing. Drew subtly NODS over Audrey’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: If you see me, why aren’t you
dialog: fucking moving?!
scene_heading: INT. BARCADE - NIGHT- (FLASHBACK
text: MORGAN approaches the dancing couple.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Okay, kids. The birthday girl’s
dialog: gonna turn into a pumpkin ina
dialog: second. Let’s get Del Taco.
text: Audrey and Drew break apart. Morgan addresses Drew.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT’D)
dialog: You’re coming. You can bring your
dialog: giant square chin with you.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No night is complete without a bad
dialog: decision at Del Taco.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Actually... I can’t.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh. Okay.
text: She’s disappointed. Drew glances back at ISIS BARTENDER, now
text: closing out the register. Preparing to leave...
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I just, have a work thing.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: At 2am?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yeah, my job is weird.
dialog: This sounds like bullshit.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Okay, well, nice meeting you, Drew.
text: She turns to leave. ON DREW -- glancing from the BARTENDER
text: retreating to the BATHROOM and AUDREY on her way out...
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Wait.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Don’t you dare give her your
dialog: number. Do not give a witness at
dialog: the bar where you’re about to
dialog: murder a man your phone number.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Too Late.
text: Audrey turns.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Too late for what?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Nothing. Here. Take my number.
dialog: Maybe we can hang out another time.
dialog: 86.
text: Audrey lights up, hands him her phone. He punches in his
text: number. Audrey leaves with Morgan.
text: The second they’re gone, Drew SPRINTS TOWARD THE BATHROOM.
scene_heading: INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - NIGHT- (FLASHBACK
text: The agents watch as onscreen, in the BATHROOM --
text: ISIS BARTENDER is finishing up at the urinal. Drew walks in.
scene_heading: INT. BARCADE BATHROOM - NIGHT- (FLASHBACK
text: Drew, now steely-eyed, expertly moves toward him, grabs the
text: back of his head -- shoves him hard right INTO THE FLUSHER
text: HANDLE. We SMASH BACK TO --
scene_heading: INT. HOSTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT- PRESENT DAY
text: Audrey and Sebastian, as before. Audrey is overwhelmed.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: My point is, being with someone --
dialog: caring about them -- makes our job
dialog: harder. So if Drew was trying with
dialog: you... that was real.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Until I got him killed.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: He got himself killed.
text: A moment. Sebastian tries to lighten the mood.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: And not that you asked my opinion,
dialog: but I would say the worst song on
dialog: that jukebox is “Your Body is a
dialog: Wonderland.” No question.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: No way dude! I lost my virginity to
dialog: that song.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Wow. To who? The cheesiest person
dialog: in the world?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh, I’m sorry. Did you lose your
dialog: virginity in a non-cheesy way,
dialog: Fancy British Guy?
text: Now Sebastian’s laughing too. They’re enjoying each other.
text: Audrey turns to leave... then turns back.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. Why didn’t you let us die?
dialog: Before.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I just thought you had value.
dialog: We see this means a lot to Audrey. And clearly there’s a
text: mutual attraction. Another charged moment between them...
text: Until THE ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER bursts in.
scene_heading: ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER
dialog: Rookworst, am I right?
text: He slams into a stall. The SOUNDS of a really large man
text: having really an explosive shit. And the moment is gone.
scene_heading: INT. FLYING PIG YOUTH HOSTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sebastian and Audrey are mid-conversation, laughing, as they
text: walk back into the room.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: There are a_ lot of Jim Morrison
dialog: posters in Amsterdam.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: God I hate the Doors. Fucking hate the Doors.
text: They laugh. Then Sebastian suddenly stops. FREEZES.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Audrey.
text: Audrey turns, GASPS-- Morgan is BOUND AND GAGGED in the middle
text: of the room -- strapped to a CHAIR -- tied to the DESK.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh my God! Morgan, what--—
speaker_heading: A VOICE (0.S.)
text: She talks too much.
text: It’s PATEL.
text: He emerges from behind the door -- GUN trained on them.
dialog: Fuck.
text: Sebastian acts lightning-quick, on instinct. He SWINGS at
text: Patel with his unslinged arm -- but he’s injured, weakened.
text: Patel easily bats him away -- then shoves the muzzle of the
text: PISTOL into Sebastian’s shoulder -- into his RAW BULLET HOLE.
text: Sebastian SCREAMS in pain.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Stop! Please! Don’t! Stop it --
dialog: 88.
text: Patel just pushes harder, harder. Sebastian WRITHES. Audrey
text: STEPS FORWARD to intervene, but he whips the gun back to her.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Hands! Up. Both of you.
dialog: (to Sebastian)
dialog: That’s both hands, cripple.
text: Audrey and Sebastian raise their arms. Sebastian winces -- he
text: can’t raise his injured arm very high. Patel notices,
speaker_heading: PATEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Higher.
text: Sebastian tries. It’s excruciating.
speaker_heading: PATEL (CONT'D)
dialog: ...dust because I can.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What is this, Patel? Revenge? I was
dialog: already suspended. You won.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: I know I won. This isn’t about you.
dialog: Or them. I’m just here for this.
text: smirks.
text: Patel moves to the desk -- reaches over a whimpering Morgan --
text: slides the FLASH DRIVE from the computer.
speaker_heading: PATEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course, now I have a couple of
text: loose ends to tie up.
text: He retrains the GUN on Sebastian, point blank...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Wait! None of this is his fault,
dialog: okay? It’s mine. This was all me
dialog: and Morgan. Just tell the CIA that.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Audrey, no...
dialog: (to Patel)
dialog: He’s not here on CIA business. He’s
dialog: working for Highland.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Please. Highland works for me. And
dialog: you won’t believe how much the
dialog: Chinese Mafia is offering me for
dialog: this thing. And the Russian Mafia.
dialog: Multiple mafias.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: So this is all about money?
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: Money, justice, whatever you want
dialog: to call it. I personally think it’s
dialog: unjust that I risk death every day
dialog: and sacrifice any shred of a
dialog: personal life to make sixty five
dialog: grand a year and wear a suit from
dialog: Men’s Wearhouse. And on that note,
dialog: I’1l just finish you all and be on
dialog: my way. As much fun as it’s been
dialog: watching you kids play Tinker
dialog: Tailor Stoner Spy.
text: Patel waits for a reaction. Nothing. Audrey’s incredulous.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What, were you hoping to get a
dialog: laugh? You’re about to kill us.
speaker_heading: PATEL
dialog: I was on the Lampoon in college.
dialog: Whatever. I’m funny. Doesn't
dialog: matter. Cause one thing’s mightier
dialog: than the pen and it’s called a
dialog: fucking handgun. For heckling me,
dialog: princess, you die first.
text: Patel moves the gun to AUDREY’S TEMPLE... hand on the
text: trigger... SQUEEZING. SQUEEZING. A tense final second, AND --
text: Patel GASPS and DROPS to the ground, DEAD! The ENORMOUS
text: FINNISH BACKPACKER stands behind him. He leans down, pulls
text: his BLOODY KNIFE from Patel’s back.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh my God.
text: Shell-shocked, Audrey rushes to Morgan and UNPEELS the tape.
text: They hug, both messes of emotion.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Thank you. Oh my God, thank you.
scene_heading: ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER
dialog: This man was robbing us, yes?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER
dialog: He might have stolen Angelika.
dialog: 90.
text: He unzips his backpack. A GIANT YELLOW SNAKE SLITHERS OUT.
scene_heading: ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER (CONT’D)
dialog: Just ignore her. She’1ll take
dialog: herself for a walk.
text: He climbs back into his bed, puts the knife down on the sill,
text: closes his eyes. The snake slithers over Patel’s dead body.
text: Everyone is a little disgusted. But they don’t dare complain
text: after what he just did for them. Morgan turns to Sebastian.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: So what now?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: First, we have to move this body.
scene_heading: INT. FLYING PIG YOUTH HOSTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Morgan and Audrey carry a blanket-wrapped SOMETHING -- it’s
text: clearly a body -- through the lobby. Sebastian in tow. There
text: are just a couple of people there. They’re all suspicious.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Just act like everything we’re
dialog: doing is normal and no one will
dialog: question it. People only suspect
dialog: you when you look like you’re
text: trying to hide something. Smile.
dialog: Make eye contact. Say hi.
text: Morgan and Audrey take the note too far, smiling and saying
text: hello to EVERY PERSON they pass. A SLEAZY GUY by the desk
text: smiles back at Morgan. Gives her a little nod - ‘Sup girl.
scene_heading: EXT. AMSTERDAM STREET - NIGHT
text: Sebastian hot-wires a BLACK SEDAN as Audrey and Morgan ease
text: Patel’s body into the trunk.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: We need a clean car. Then we need
dialog: to get out of the city.
scene_heading: I/E. BLACK SEDAN - NIGHT
text: Audrey drives. Sebastian’s shotgun. Morgan in the back.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: How did he find us?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: We took every precaution. We used
dialog: cash. No phones --
dialog: 91.
text: Then Audrey realizes something. Turns back to Morgan. Morgan
text: quickly looks out the window. Audrey realizes.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Morgan, did you call your parents?!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I’m sorry! I just had to tell them
dialog: I was okay! I thought maybe my dad
dialog: found out about Roger and I didn’t
dialog: want them to think I was dead so I
dialog: got a burner phone at the gift shop
dialog: and just said hey I’m fine -- real
dialog: fast -- then I threw it ina
dialog: dumpster! Like on The Wire! I
dialog: thought you couldn’t track a call
dialog: if it was less than two minutes!
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: That’s not a thing anymore.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I realize that now.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Morgan. Listen to me. You cannot do
dialog: any more shit like that. You put
dialog: all of our lives in jeopardy.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I’m sorry! But it’s not like I’m the
dialog: only one of us who fucked up.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Who else fucked up?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: You left the drive in the computer?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Just for a second! You were in the
dialog: room! Where else would I put it?!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: What’s wrong with your ass?!
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: My ass? I couldn’t have done that
dialog: with my arm like this! I wouldn’t
dialog: have been able to get the angle.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You could have asked one of us to
dialog: help you insert it. I was in the
dialog: bathroom with you.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Yeah. I’m sure Audrey would have
dialog: loved to put something up your ass!
dialog: I’m sure she still would.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (reddening)
dialog: Not in a sexual way. Just like, for
dialog: the sake of mankind.
scene_heading: EXT. NDSM WHARF, OUTSIDE AMSTERDAM - NIGHT
text: An abandoned industrial area by the waterfront under the
text: cover of night. The girls fill Patel’s pockets with ROCKS.
text: The girls lower Patel into the water. As body slowly sinks, a
text: CELL PHONE BUZZES. PATEL’s. It’s coming from under the
text: blanket. It’s on him. The girls freeze, set the body down.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: We need to check who he’s texting.
text: Audrey takes a breath, and wades into the water. His dead
text: face stares back at her. She winces, reaches into his jacket,
text: removes the phone before it gets wet. Slides to unlock it.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: The phone needs his thumbprint.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Well... there’s his thumb.
text: Audrey grabs Patel’s dead arm. She presses thumb to button.
text: The phone unlocks. There’s a TEXT from an unknown number:
dialog: “Text me when you get the package.”
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What do I say back? Who is he
dialog: texting with?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Let’s find out. Tell them we have
text: it and ask them where the drop is.
text: She writes back. A moment, then another BUZZ.
dialog: “Bring it to Operation Albrecht.”
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What’s “Operation Albrecht”?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Let’s check his emails.
dialog: 93.
text: Sebastian pulls the DRIVE and laptop from his bag. Inserts
text: the drive, kneels on the dirty ground, laptop on his knee...
scene_heading: ONSCREEN -- PATEL’S EMAILS. He searches “Albrecht.”
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: He’s been emailing with someone
dialog: named “Hunter Pierce.”
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Okay, so, a gay porn star.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: “Operation Albrecht” appears to be
dialog: Highland’s first planned
dialog: assassination. They don’t name the
dialog: target, but it’s going down
text: tomorrow night. There’s a gala at
dialog: the Museum of German Technology in
dialog: Berlin. Text back and tell him
dialog: you'll be there with the drive.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
text: Shit. It locked again.
text: Audrey uses Patel’s thumb again, replies. Meanwhile--
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Wow, Patel has a lot of pictures of
dialog: his mom on here.
text: ON THE SCREEN -- Photos of PATEL and an OLDER WOMAN.
text: where they’re BOTH NAKED AND MAKING OUT.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Ahh. Not his mom! Not his mom!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Wait!
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: That person’s gonna keeps texting.
dialog: We'll need his thumb.
dialog: Then one
text: They all exchange looks.
text: is already in the water.
text: shore and SMASHES IT on
text: returns the cold water,
text: CLOSE on his hand as it
dialog: There’s just one option and Audrey
text: She grabs a BEER BOTTLE from the
text: a rock. Holding the JAGGED GLASS, she
text: over to Patel’s body, nearly under.
text: sinks. Audrey grabs it -- uses the
text: glass as a BLADE, CUTS PATEL’S THUMB OFF. Not much blood.
text: She holds up the thumb to her cohorts in victory. It’s
text: disgusting, but we see Audrey is also weirdly proud of
dialog: herself. She really is a natural at this.
dialog: 94.
scene_heading: EXT. BERLIN - DAY
text: The sun rises over Berlin.
speaker_heading: BERLIN, GERMANY
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Here’s the plan. The guest list for
dialog: the gala includes the Canadian
dialog: ambassador and his wife. Audrey,
dialog: you and I will pose as them.
scene_heading: INT. TEGEL AIRPORT, BERLIN - CUSTOMS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Passengers deplane, hug family, pick up their bags.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (V.O.)
dialog: Won’t people know what they look
dialog: like?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: No. No one ever remembers what
dialog: Canadians look like... They land at
text: Tegel Airport at 2pm.
text: At BAGGAGE CLAIM -- a GENERICALLY HANDSOME MAN and his PLAIN
text: BLOND WIFE walk briskly towards... A SIGN with their NAMES on
text: it: “AMBASSADOR AND MRS. MULLICAY.” Pan up--
text: The DRIVER HOLDING IT is MORGAN. In a hat and everything.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (V.O.)
dialog: Can I do an accent?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: You don’t need to.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (V.O.)
dialog: Nah, I’m gonna do an accent. I know
dialog: what I’m gonna do. “To really
dialog: inhabit a character, you must speak
text: with their tongue.” Stanislavsky.
text: She takes the couple’s carry-ons. In a THICK COCKNEY ACCENT:
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: ‘ELLO. Funny coincidence -- you two
dialog: is from London, Ontario and me, I’m
dialog: from Jolly Old London! England.
text: The Canadians are taken aback.
scene_heading: EXT. TEGEL AIRPORT - PARKING GARAGE ROOF - DAY
dialog: 
text: Morgan leads them to a LIMO in a corner of the EMPTY roof. It
dialog: wasn’t necessary to park this far. The Canadians exchange
text: glances but don’t say anything because they’re Canadian.
dialog: 95.
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - MOMENTS LATER
text: Morgan turns on the engine and opens the sunroof...
text: AUDREY -- suddenly on TOP OF THE CAR -- sticks her head down
text: into it! The Canadians SCREAM. Morgan feigns SHOCK too.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Oh my! Rascal! Ruffian! Begone!
text: Audrey shoots the couple with TRANQ DARTS. They pass out.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Have a nice nap, guys. Sorry you'll
dialog: miss the party.
scene_heading: INT. GERMAN REST STOP BATHROOM - DAY
text: A dingy public bathroom. Audrey DYES HER HAIR BLOND in the
text: sink to MATCH THE CANADIAN WOMAN’S. Morgan dyes her hair RED.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Do I look like her?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Yeah. Do I look awesome?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You look cute.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I just feel like for our
dialog: friendship, we should be changing
dialog: our looks at the same time. You to
dialog: a Canadian Ambassador’s wife and me
text: to a young Julianne Moore.
scene_heading: EXT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN - NIGHT
text: A stunning modern glass-walled building with a GOLDEN PLANE
text: on top. Fancy couples walk up a RED CARPET to the GRAND
text: ENTRANCE, manned by SECURITY.
text: From behind, we follow a MAN in a TUXEDO, and a BLOND WOMAN
text: in a RED SATIN DRESS and HEELS. We move around them... It’s
text: Sebastian and Audrey. They look amazing. Throughout this
text: sequence, Sebastian, Audrey and Morgan will be able to hear
text: each other on earpieces.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Morgan, are you in position?
scene_heading: EXT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN - BACK DOOR - INTERCUT
text: Morgan is dressed in a LAVENDER UNITARD. Acrobats in matching
text: unitards stretch and warm up. Morgan stretches with them.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I was born in position.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Everyone was born in position.
dialog: That’s why they call it “the fetal
dialog: position.”
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Oh, I just put that together. But
dialog: yes. I’m psyched about this.
text: Performing with Cirque de Soleil is
dialog: like, a top three dream. I was a
text: Cc.I.T. in Acrobatics and Clowning at
dialog: camp. It was competitive.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Once again, Morgan, you are not
dialog: performing with the troupe. Your
dialog: job is to stay backstage and watch
dialog: the surveillance. We have to locate
dialog: the assassin.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: What about just for one song?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: No.
text: Morgan longingly eyes a LITHE MAN doing a warm-up back flip.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: This is like taking a thoroughbred
dialog: to the Kentucky Derby and telling
dialog: him, “you have to stand here and
dialog: watch the Kentucky Derby, Horse.”
text: Sebastian addresses the Marines in a PERFECT CANADIAN ACCENT.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Evening! Honey, you have our
dialog: passports?
text: Audrey proffers the Canadians’ passports. The Marine surveys
text: them. Looks back to Sebastian and Audrey. A tense moment.
text: Then he waves them through. As they enter the party...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That was a perfect Canadian accent.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I watch a lot of Degrassi.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Really?!
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (dumb bro accent)
dialog: Naw -- it’s my training, dumbass.
dialog: (then)
dialog: That was my LA accent.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Shut it.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You look good as a blond, by the
dialog: way. And are you wearing lipstick?
text: Hearing this, MORGAN smiles as she mans --
scene_heading: INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: -- a bank of SECURITY SCREENS. Guests move around the party.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: What am I watching for exactly?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Anyone you’ve seen before. Or
dialog: anyone who looks suspicious.
text: But Morgan can’t help but glance longingly at the unitard-
text: clad Cirque de Soleil performers as they frolic past the
text: curtains to a STAGE set up in the ATRIUM.
scene_heading: INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, LOCOMOTIVE ROOM - SAME
text: A vast room of German TRAIN CARS from various eras. Sebastian
text: and Audrey hold hands as they move through the crowd.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What constitutes suspicious?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Use your instincts.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I have great instincts. If I’m
dialog: attracted to them, they’re probably
dialog: gonna get us killed.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: So, that guy might kill us?
text: Sebastian points to a cheesy BRAZILIAN DIPLOMAT with a
text: ponytail, in a white tux.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Actually, my high school boyfriend
dialog: Craig looked like that.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Interests included: Family Guy and
text: finger-banging. Usually at the same
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: My girlfriend at Uni kinda looked
dialog: like her.
text: He points to a TINY VIETNAMESE WOMAN.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I had that phase in college too.
scene_heading: INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, BACKSTAGE - INTERCUT
text: Morgan’s eyes widen, seeing someone head towards the stage.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Hey. I see someone very suspicious.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Okay. Stay calm. Describe him.
text: REVEAL the man Morgan was talking about as she describes him.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
text: He has a long twirly mustache. Big
text: pointy scary eyebrows. He’s
text: holding... yeah, he’s holding a bag
text: with a big dollar sign on it.
text: Sebastian and Audrey glance at the stage. The MUSTACHE MAN is
text: clearly the bad guy in the Cirque de Soleil show.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I think that guy’s part of the show.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah, I don’t know that an actual
dialog: bad guy would look like an evil Mr.
dialog: Monopoly.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I’m gonna go with my gut on this.
text: Morgan joins the acrobats heading for the stage. She keeps
text: her eyes on Mustache Man as she climbs THE TRAPEZE.
text: The man is miming and twirling his mustache.
text: As Morgan gets to the top... he opens his DOLLAR SIGN BAG and
text: CONFETTI pours out on to the crowd.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait. You know what? I think you
dialog: might be right.
dialog: 99.
text: AUDREY notices a COUPLE across the room. She grabs Sebastian.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Tom and Marsha. Or whatever the
dialog: fuck their names are. Drew’s fake
dialog: parents. They’re the assassins.
text: Sure enough, “Tom and “Marsha” -- also dressed FORMALLY,
text: blending in -- stand at the bar. Glam outfits. Finally
text: looking like the chameleonic agents they really are.
text: "Marsha” spots them. She taps “Tom.” The couples stare at
text: each other for an intense moment across the room... Just as a
text: group of people passes between them.
text: When the sea opens up again, “Tom” and “Marsha” are gone.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Morgan, get down. I’ve been blown.
speaker_heading: Morgan LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: This isn’t funny.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Oh God, I know. I know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you just said “I’ve been
dialog: blown.”
text: She laughs again. Sebastian shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Okay, both of you. Stay together and
text: in plain sight until I get back.
dialog: (then, to Audrey)
dialog: You put the drive somewhere safe?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yes. Very safe.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Is it in... the same place as last
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You’1l have to find out.
text: She flinches. That came out way too forward. Audrey stammers.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, not “you'll see” as in... I
dialog: just meant I’11 tell you later...
dialog: Whatever, just go!
text: As Sebastian hurries off, also blushing a little.
scene_heading: INT. TRAPEZE - SAME
text: Morgan turns to descend the ladder when she sees someone
text: across the way, on the opposite acrobat landing.
text: NADEDJA. Face bandaged but wearing a unitard like it was made
text: for her. Morgan mutters to herself:
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Oh my God. That girl.
text: A MALE ACROBAT behind her pipes up, also staring at Nadedja.
speaker_heading: MALE ACROBAT
dialog: I know. Butterface, right?
text: Nadedja sees them. Morgan grabs the trapeze. It’s going down.
scene_heading: INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Sebastian hurries to the edge of the ballroom -- a big DOOR
text: into a BACK HALLWAY... manned by a SECURITY GUARD. Sebastian
text: thinks fast -- pretends not to see the guard as he pulls a
text: pack of CIGARETTES from his jacket, tries to hurry past.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Rauchen verboten! No smoking! Sir!
text: But Sebastian’s on the other side of him now. He plays DUMB,
text: steps back. The guard follows. Now they’re behind the door.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Sorry. Filthy habit, I know.
dialog: (conspiratorially)
dialog: Want one?
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Sir, I don’t smoke.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Me neither. Me neither.
text: Sebastian TOUCHES THE UNLIT CIGARETTE to the guard’s neck.
text: BZZZZZT. It’s a TASER. The guard attempts to GRAB SEBASTIAN
text: as he falls... knocking out Sebastian’s EAR PIECE.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 101.
text: He scans the floor but can’t find it in the shadowy darkness.
text: Fuck it. He has to move. Sebastian hurries down the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, LOCOMOTIVE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Back in the crowded ballroom. Audrey stands alone in the
text: CROWD. PATEL’S PHONE VIBRATES in her hand. A new text:
dialog: “In position. Where are you?”
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Sebastian? They just texted me...
dialog: Sebastian?
text: Silence. Audrey starts to get nervous.
scene_heading: INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, AVIATION ROOM - SAME
text: Sebastian enters a dark room full of imposing GERMAN PLANES.
text: He looks around. No one in sight.
text: THUNK! A PROPELLER comes out of nowhere and KNOCKS HIM from
text: behind. Sebastian collapses, passed out.
scene_heading: INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN - SAME
text: Audrey stares at the phone. Still no response. Tries again.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Sebastian, what’s going on?
text: Audrey inhales. She’s gonna have to do this herself. She
text: subtly reaches into her bag and pulls out her TUBE OF
text: LIPSTICK. Takes the cap off... twists it.
text: PATEL’S THUMB SPIRALS UP. Audrey shudders a little as she
text: uses it unlock the phone. Sends a text.
dialog: She texts: “I don’t see you”
text: She gets another text: “Ships Room”
text: Audrey takes a deep breath. As she crosses to the EXIT, she
text: STUMBLES over the FALLEN GUARD. Beside him, Sebastian’s
text: “CIGARETTES.” Audrey picks them up, hurries down the hall.
text: PRE-LAP loud CHEERING...
scene_heading: INT. ATRIUM, TRAPEZE - SAME
text: THE CROWD GOES WILD as “Butterface” guy does an impressive
text: back-flip. On the landing... CLOSE ON MORGAN. She’s next.
dialog: Morgan’s entire life has been building to this moment. Morgan
text: jumps from the landing, SWINGING a HUNDRED FEET IN THE AIR!
dialog: 102.
text: NADEDJA does the same, swinging from the other side. CRASH!
text: The women meet in the middle.
text: NADEDJA deals the first blow -- KICKING MORGAN in the
text: stomach. Morgan SWINGS BACK, sticks her FEET OUT, CAREENS
text: back into Nadedja. Knocks her back.
text: The crowd CHEERS, unaware this is for real. Loving it.
text: Despite that it’s life or death, Morgan is exhilarated too.
scene_heading: INT. SHIPS ROOM - NIGHT
text: Audrey enters a ROOM of CENTURIES-OLD SHIPS. She steps to the
text: middle of room. Silence. Then -- She sees a SHADOW moving.
text: Audrey freezes. The figure keeps moving toward her. And
text: finally emerges into the light...
text: IT’S DREW. HOLY SHIT. IT’S FUCKING DREW!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What the fuck?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh my God! Audrey!
text: He seems overjoyed to see her. Audrey’s mind is blown.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So wait, you’re not... ?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Dead? Yeah. That was a surprise to
dialog: me too, after what happened.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: But I_saw you get shot. You were
dialog: bleeding. You were dead. I thought.
dialog: You weren’t dead?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I was right on the edge. But the
dialog: bullets missed my vital organs. I
text: woke up in a military hospital.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: But on the news... Morgan and I are
dialog: like, wanted for your murder.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You're not. That’s how the CIA’s
dialog: been trying to find you. They lie.
dialog: But they don’t want to hurt you.
dialog: They're trying to keep you alive.
dialog: That’s why I’m here. To save you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And stop Henshaw.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Sebastian? He’s been helping us.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Audrey, have you heard of Highland?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: That’s who Sebastian’s working for.
dialog: He’s the assassin.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So who’s the target?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Me. I am. He’s been using you to
dialog: get to me. And it worked.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (wait? what?)
dialog: That doesn’t make sense. Sebastian
dialog: knows I thought you were dead. And
dialog: I saw Patel try to kill him. And
dialog: Patel admitted he worked with
dialog: Highland. And I’ve been texting
dialog: with the assassin with Sebastian
dialog: right next to me, so how --
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hey. Can we like, stop with the
dialog: questions for a second? I’m just...
dialog: I almost died a few days ago. I
dialog: thought I would never see you
dialog: again. Can I just give you a hug?
text: But when he steps toward her, Audrey reflexively steps back.
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Audrey...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Sorry. I’m just on edge. People have
dialog: been trying to kill me all week. I
dialog: know that’s like, all in a day’s work
dialog: for you but I work at Trader Joe's...
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You must have been so scared. Ugh,
dialog: the thought of anyone trying to
dialog: hurt you...
text: Audrey flinches. This triggers something for her.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You hurt me, Drew. A lot.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I know I did. And I’m so sorry...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You lied to me about everything. You
dialog: let me think I was meeting your
dialog: parents and they weren’t your
dialog: parents.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: They’re the people I’ve been hiding
dialog: from. When they found me in LA, I
dialog: knew my cover was blown. And it was
dialog: just easier to... make something
dialog: up... I knew if I told you the
dialog: truth, it would lead to questions I
dialog: couldn’t answer.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Is that why you broke up with me by
dialog: text message? Because it was too
dialog: hard to tell me the truth? You said
dialog: you loved me. Was that a lie too?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: No! I did love you. I do love you.
dialog: Even more now that we can finally
dialog: be honest with each other.
dialog: This is everything Audrey was waiting for. Especially when--
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Audrey Stockman, I love you as much
dialog: as I hate that fucking Crash Test
dialog: Dummies song.
text: Audrey smiles. Letting her guard down a little. Playing back:
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Which Crash Test Dummies song are
dialog: you referring to, Drew? Cause there
dialog: are so many. I don’t remember any
dialog: one in particular.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No really, I’m gonna need you to
dialog: jog my memory. Cause I have all
dialog: their albums and there are just, a
dialog: lot of tracks. And bonus tracks.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I hate you. I know I just said I
dialog: love you but I also hate you.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: If you could maybe just sing a
dialog: couple bars. How does it go?
text: Drew shakes his head. He knows what he has to do. And then,
text: in a deep bass-baritone, Drew starts SERENADING AUDREY.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Once, there was this girl who...
text: Off Audrey -- a captive audience in spite of herself.
scene_heading: INT. ATRIUM, TRAPEZE - SAME
text: Morgan struggles to hang on to the TRAPEZE with one hand as--
text: NADEDJA swings across... SLAMS both her feet into the arm
text: that’s holding on. Morgan’s FINGERS slip... but she regains
text: her balance, tightens her fist. Reaches up with the other
text: hand, steadies herself, swings back towards waiting Nadedja --
text: Morgan KICKS Nadedja at full force. It just makes Nadedja
text: mad. From behind her unitard, Nadedja PULLS a GUN. The crowd
text: keeps cheering. Assuming it’s part of the show. Until...
dialog: Nadedja FIRES --
text: Morgan LETS GO OF THE TRAPEZE -- sails through the air, just
text: missing the BULLET. It HITS an ACROBAT on the far platform.
text: The Acrobat falls backward, DEAD. He hits the floor, at the
text: crowd's feet. SLAM. The crowd is stunned. As they realize
dialog: what’s really going on--
text: MORGAN SAILS onto NADEDJA’S TRAPEZE... landing on top of
text: Nadedja -- her legs wrapped around Nadedja’s NECK.
text: NADEDJA TIPS backwards under the weight... just as MORGAN
text: manages to GRAB the TRAPEZE by the tips of her fingers.
text: Nadedja flails, tries to get a grip. But Morgan blocks her.
text: NADEDJA FALLS, FALLS, FALLS -- SLAM. She hits the FLOOR from
text: a hundred feet, at the crowd’s feet.
text: People are now fully SCREAMING. NADEDJA is finally DEAD.
text: Morgan SWINGS safely above, watching from her perch. Catching
dialog: her breath. Holy fucking shit.
scene_heading: INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, SHIPS ROOM - SAME
text: Drew is now standing close to Audrey. Leaning against an old
text: ship just like they leaned against that jukebox at Barcade.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: ...When I woke up in that hospital
dialog: and I didn’t know where you were,
dialog: or if you were even alive...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I know. I know. When that guy shot
dialog: you... it was so fucking horrible.
text: Audrey chokes back tears a little. The adrenaline she’s been
text: running on for days giving way to the raw emotion she’d
text: tamped down. She tries to fight it but Drew’s not blind.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hey. Kiddo.
text: The term of endearment just makes Audrey more emotional. Drew
text: puts his arm around her and holds her close. Audrey
text: tentatively lets him. In his arms, she relaxes. She’s been
text: wanting this for months. They embrace for a moment. Then...
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Ooh, what’s this?
text: Drew pulls the TASER CIGARETTES sticking out of her purse.
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: You got some spy gadgets?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What else you got here, Jane Bond?
text: He tosses the cigarettes aside and gently takes Audrey’s bag
text: off her shoulder. Starts rifling through.
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: When’d you start wearing lipstick?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Uh, I wouldn’t open that.
text: He does anyway. Finds Patel’s THUMB.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Wow. A thousand guesses and I never
dialog: would have landed on thumb.
text: Audrey laughs as Drew returns to the purse. Rifles quicker
text: now -- less playful. Audrey gets a weird feeling.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Hey. The drive isn’t in there.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What? No! Audrey...
text: He stops rummaging. Puts a hand on Audrey’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: (too fast, less genuine)
dialog: We're in this together! We just
dialog: have to get out of here. Trust me.
dialog: We can go anywhere you want. You
dialog: pick. China? You love Chinese food.
dialog: Can you imagine what they can do
text: with a breakfast burrito over there
dialog: with those moo shu pancakes?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You said not to trust anyone.
text: They lock eyes for a second.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Touché.
text: Then the DOOR OPENS. “TOM” and “MARSHA” drag in a CUFFED,
scene_heading: GROGGY SEBASTIAN.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh my God! Sebastian...
text: Audrey rushes toward him.
speaker_heading: DREW
text: Audrey. He’s with them.
speaker_heading: “MARSHA"
dialog: Oh look! We’re all together again.
dialog: Just like the Cheesecake Factory.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Fuck, you hit me hard. I’m
text: hallucinating.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
text: No, it’s Drew. He’s still alive.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Audrey... get away from him. Now.
dialog: He’s gonna kill all of us.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Funny, he just said the same thing
dialog: about you.
text: We can see Audrey really doesn’t know who to trust.
dialog: 108.
scene_heading: INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Morgan rushes down the hall, frantically looking for
dialog: Sebastian and Audrey.
scene_heading: INT. SHIPS ROOM - NIGHT
text: The others, as before. “Tom” turns to Drew impatiently.
speaker_heading: “TOM”
dialog: All right, Thayer, we gave hima
dialog: full check. Drive’s not on him. Can
dialog: we remove the target now?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: Wait, you said you were the target.
dialog: You said you’re Operation Albrecht.
text: “Marsha” points her gun at Audrey’s head. Audrey is
text: TERRIFIED. Then DREW pulls out a GUN as well... Audrey
text: screams... But he doesn’t shoot her. He SHOOTS MARSHA. BAM.
text: “TOM” LUNGES for the door but Drew gets him too. BAM. “Tom”
text: falls back, on to an ANCIENT ANCHOR. It IMPALES HIS HEAD.
text: Brain matter everywhere. Audrey shakes, tries not to wretch.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my god...
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: It’s okay, Audrey. I’m right here.
dialog: No one else matters right now.
text: He turns the gun on SEBASTIAN.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Drew, don’t!
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Audrey, listen to me. Drew has been
dialog: working with Patel.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Sebastian was working with Patel.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Audrey, you saw Patel try to kill
dialog: me yesterday. He’s the one who sent
dialog: that assassin after you in Belgium.
dialog: Drew was gonna let that happen. He
dialog: would have let you die.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Sebastian sent the assassin to
dialog: Belgium.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Okay. Everything I say you did, you
dialog: can’t just say I did.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I can do whatever I want! I’m the
text: one with the gun.
text: He turns to Audrey. Meanwhile, Audrey notices MORGAN slip
text: into the room. No one else sees her... Morgan spots DREW.
text: SHOCKING. But she stops herself from making any noise. The
text: girls share a meaningful look.
text: Morgan tiptoes into the SHIP beside Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: That night we met... changed my
dialog: life. I was driving by that bar and
dialog: I saw you. Walking. And I was like,
dialog: wherever that girl’s going, that’s
dialog: where I want to be.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So that’s why you went into
dialog: Barcade? Because you saw me?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I would have followed you anywhere.
dialog: There was just something magnetic.
dialog: I know this is cheesy but it felt
text: like Kismet. It felt like fate.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Really? Cause I thought we were
dialog: being totally honest with each
dialog: other. You went to Barcade to
text: assassinate the bartender.
text: And suddenly, Audrey puts it all together.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait. Hunter Pierce, from those
dialog: emails. That was Ryan Phillippe’s
dialog: character in that terrible “Marked
dialog: Target” movie you made me watch.
dialog: And “Albrecht”. That’s Theo
dialog: Albrecht. Founder of Trader Joe’s.
dialog: You came here to assassinate... me.
text: SIRENS approach outside. Drew SNAPS.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh my God, I forgot how fucking
dialog: annoying you are. Fuck this shit.
text: Drew SHOOTS SEBASTIAN, who falls backwards. Audrey tries to
text: move to him but Drew is now pointing the gun at her.
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Where’s the fucking drive?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I'll tell you, okay? But there’s
dialog: one thing you need to know first.
dialog: Morgan likes to set things on fire.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Morgan likes to set things on fire.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP - SAME
text: Morgan crouches behind a SMALL SHIP’S CANNON, aiming it at
text: Drew. She uses the CIGARETTE TASER he tossed aside to LIGHT
text: THE FUSE. Amazingly, it WORKS.
speaker_heading: BAM!
scene_heading: INT. SHIPS ROOM - SAME
text: A CANNONBALL sails from the ANCIENT CANNON across the room...
text: NOWHERE NEAR DREW. It arcs through the air -- CRASHES through
text: the glass window. SMASH! It lands on a parked car outside. A
text: CAR ALARM sounds. Bystanders yell -- what the fuck?
text: Drew turns to Audrey, his charming smile now condescending.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Nice shot. Great plan, Audrey.
text: He aims his gun at Audrey’s head.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP - SAME
text: Panicking, she picks up a SOFTBALL-SIZED CANNONBALL -- heavy
text: as hell. But she flings it with every bit of her strength.
scene_heading: INT. SHIPS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The CANNONBALL CONKS Drew on the head. HARD. He weaves. He
text: falls. He drops his gun --
text: Audrey scrambles for the gun. As does Drew. As she gets
text: closer he reaches for her leg. She FALLS. Drew pulls her as
text: Audrey reaches and stretches for the gun. She kicks -- gets
text: him a few times in the face -- but Drew holds on.
text: She... GRABS it just as -- Drew gets up and LEAPS on top of
text: her. They struggle -- Audrey points her gun at Drew but
text: doesn’t shoot as Drew pulls the gun from her by the barrel.
dialog: 111.
text: Then BAM. She SHOOTS. There’s a big bloody GAPING HOLE in his
text: hand. She stands and aims at the now fallen Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Bitch! You blew my fucking hand off!
text: Morgan runs to Audrey from the ship as Drew continues wailing.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Jesus, how are you still alive?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Fuck you. I never liked you.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Feeling’s mutual, dick.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: She tried to tell me you were full
dialog: of shit. Should’ve listened.
text: SIREN LIGHTS flash from right outside. The COPS are coming.
text: Sounds of COMMOTION as POLICE descend on the building. Audrey
text: stays still and strong, gun steady, trained on Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You're running out of time. Kill
dialog: me. That’s what I would do.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I’m sure it is. But I’m a better
dialog: person than you. You revealed your
dialog: true self. This is mine.
text: The GERMAN POLICE burst in! Audrey calmly puts the gun down
text: and nods to them. Take him. As the Polizei circle Drew, they
text: try to cuff him but can only manage his non-destroyed hand.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: To quote a text message I got once:
dialog: “Hey there -- it’s over. Sorry.”
text: Another OFFICER HELPS SEBASTIAN TO HIS FEET. He’s okay -- he
text: was wearing a BULLET PROOF VEST. Audrey rushes up.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: What?! I didn’t know you had bullet-
dialog: proof vests!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: I just had the one.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You know, I would’ve felt a little
dialog: more comfortable if I also had a
dialog: bullet-proof vest. So much for you
dialog: protecting me.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You protected yourself.
text: Audrey smiles. He’s right, on a number of levels.
scene_heading: EXT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN - NIGHT
text: Chaos. The place is SURROUNDED by POLICE CARS. The POLIZEI
text: haul Drew into one just as Sebastian and Audrey step outside.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Ambassador? Ma’am? Do you need an
dialog: ambulance?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (demure, Canadian)
dialog: Oh no. We're fine, thanks. We just
dialog: have to leave... emergency back
dialog: home... our hockey team is sick.
text: Morgan runs out after them. As she passes the guard:
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Cirque de Soleil is also from
dialog: Canada. So I know them.
scene_heading: EXT. LANDWEHR CANAL - NIGHT
text: Our heroes walk down the gorgeous riverside BIKE PATH, away
text: from the FUCKING CHAOS behind them.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Sebastian... can I see your phone?
text: He hands it over. Morgan dials as they walk.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom! Get Dad! Yeah, I know, I’m
dialog: calling from this international
dialog: spy’s phone... Sebastian Henshaw.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Can you not reveal my identity?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
text: She tells them everything. She’s
dialog: not allowed to lie.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Now I don’t have to.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess what, guys?! I just went to a

dialog: BEEP. Call waiting.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ugh. Hang on a second.
scene_heading: INT. CIA PARIS STATION, WENDY'S OFFICE - NIGHT - INTERCUT
text: Wendy sits at her desk, on the phone.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Nice job, Henshaw. We found the
dialog: correspondence between Thayer,
dialog: Patel and Highland... I’m sorry I
dialog: questioned your loyalty.
text: Behind her, Wendy’s ADORABLE SON (6) hands her a cute drawing.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT’D)
dialog: What’s this supposed to be? A dog? A
dialog: cat? It looks like a piece of shit.
dialog: (then, into phone)
dialog: Destroy that drive. Then come in.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I'll give him the message. I’m just
dialog: kinda on the other line right now.
text: Morgan hangs up on Wendy. Wendy stares at the phone. That was
dialog: a first. Morgan Sebastian.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (CONT'D)
dialog: CIA lady said destroy the drive.
dialog: (then, to her parents)
dialog: Okay, and what did the Doctor say
dialog: about your cholesterol?
dialog: On Sebastian and Audrey --
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: So Drew didn’t get the drive.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You said put it somewhere safe.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Morgan, give me the thing.
text: Morgan, still on the phone, fishes the drive from her

speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Uh, sure.
text: Edward Snowden produces two THEATER TICKETS from his pocket.
speaker_heading: EDWARD SNOWDEN
dialog: You’re coming with me to see Guys

text: Then a bottle of ice-cold Riesling.
dialog: And then maybe we can repeat what
dialog: happened last time after we saw
text: Guys and Dolls together at camp.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: ...Or another idea is we can just
dialog: go see Guys and Dolls as friends.
speaker_heading: EDWARD SNOWDEN
dialog: Should've known that was gonna
dialog: happen.
text: BACK ON AUDREY and SEBASTIAN. Staring at the drive.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: You can do the honors.
text: Audrey smiles. Then SNAPS THE DRIVE IN HALF. She hurls the
text: pieces OFF THE BRIDGE.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Can’t they just make another one?
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: It’s their software. They can make
dialog: these whenever they want. That’s
dialog: where the world is headed anyway.
dialog: Total transparency. Everyone wants
dialog: to know everything.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: I still think it’s better to give
dialog: people the chance to show you who
dialog: they are. On their own terms.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: SEBASTIAN
dialog: Safe to say you’ve done that.
text: A sweet, intimate silence...
text: Then Audrey and Sebastian finally KISS. We leave them in
text: peace, pulling out to the Berlin night...
scene_heading: SIX MONTHS LATER
scene_heading: INT. SILVER LAKE TRADER JOE’S - DAY
text: Audrey's back at the register, still with her BLOND HAIR. And
text: there’s another big difference: she looks HAPPY to be here as
text: she rings up a customer. The next customer steps up... TESS.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Oh my God, Audrey! Your blond hair
dialog: is so fun!
dialog: (then, pitying)
dialog: I didn’t know you still worked
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Hey Tess! Yeah, you know, I
dialog: realized this job is actually
dialog: perfect for me. It’s easy, it’s not
dialog: too stressful, I can save my energy
dialog: for my real passions. And you can’t
dialog: beat the flexibility.
text: Tess is taken aback. Audrey’s CELL BUZZES with a TEXT.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Speaking of which, they need me in
dialog: the supply room! God I love when I
dialog: have to get supplies.
scene_heading: INT. TRADER JOE'S SUPPLY ROOM - DAY
text: Audrey works quickly -- stealthily removes a CINDER BLOCK
text: from the wall -- pulls out a FAKE PASSPORT, FOREIGN MONEY,
dialog: etc. As skilled as Drew was at this.
scene_heading: EXT. TRADER JOE’S PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Audrey moves fast toward the corner of the lot where the SAME
text: BLACK VAN she was interrogated in is parked. This time,
text: Audrey confidently slides the door open and dives in without
text: hesitation. The van glides away.
dialog: 116.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIBUYA, TOKYO - LATE NIGHT
text: The unmistakable neon hub of Tokyo’s popular nightlife area.
text: As we move to a side street, push into a dark BASEMENT CLUB--
speaker_heading: TOKYO, JAPAN
scene_heading: INT. SHIBUYA KARAOKE CLUB - NIGHT
text: Dimly lit except for garish flashing neon lights. We follow--
text: AUDREY -- now in a stunning GOLD COCKTAIL DRESS -- as she
text: confidently winds through a packed, intoxicated crowd.
text: Approaches an expressionless CLERK at a HOST STAND.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (Japanese)
dialog: Reservation?
text: Audrey's about to give her name when the sound of GLASS
text: SHATTERING cuts the air. The clerk -- and everyone else --
text: turns, distracted by the DRUNK COUPLE who just knocked over a
text: huge stack of glasses...
text: It’s MORGAN. With a Japanese BUSINESSMAN. Making a huge
text: scene. Seemingly oblivious to Audrey.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (to the Businessman)
dialog: Oh my God Akira you’re a mess!
dialog: (to the bartenders)
dialog: Barkeep! Two more Yakuzas please!
dialog: Or wait, whatever this whiskey is
dialog: called. Yakuza is the thing you’re
dialog: in, right? Oh wait, shit, was that
dialog: a secret?
text: Unattended now, Audrey subtly REACHES BEHIND THE HOST STAND
text: and presses a button. A DOOR behind the stand clicks.
text: Unlocked. Audrey heads for it, when--
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Miss? Excuse me! Miss!
text: This stops Audrey dead. She slowly turns...
text: It’s SEBASTIAN. At the bar behind her. Holding out a GOLD
text: PURSE that matches Audrey’s dress.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh! Silly me. Must have dropped
dialog: that.
text: They share a private, knowing, look, then she keeps moving.
dialog: 117.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: ...Audrey removes a GUN from the purse as she strides down
text: the hall, solo. Drops the purse in the trash as she arrives --
text: At the end of the hall. Another door. Inside, muffled voices
text: conspire, up to no good. Audrey takes a deep breath.
text: As she cocks the gun and kicks the door open, we --
text: SMASH TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: THE END
