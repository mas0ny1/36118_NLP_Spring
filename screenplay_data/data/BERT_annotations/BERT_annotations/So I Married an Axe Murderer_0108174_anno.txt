scene_heading: MONTAGE OF VARIOUS SHOTS OF SAN FRANCISCO - DUSK
text: Over this we hear a recording of Jack Kerouac's poem, San
text: Francisco which is accompanied by a BE-BOP trio. Kerouac's
text: poetry coincides with the various shots of San Francisco. We
text: come to a sign for Jack Kerouac Street. We PAN OVER to "THE
text: CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE" and continue along to the ALLEYWAY
text: where there is a large high-contrast black and white sign
dialog: depicting Jack Kerouac in his famous "I'm looking into the
dialog: distance, having a brilliant thought" pose...
text: CHARLIE MACKENZIE, in his late twenties, wearing a flannel
text: shirt and torn jeans, walks INTO THE FRAME, right in front
text: of the picture of Jack Kerouac and inadvertently strikes the
text: exact same pose. We PULL BACK to reveal that Charlie has a
text: bag of garbage in his right hand, which he deposits in the
text: alleyway. We FOLLOW Charlie into...
scene_heading: INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE
text: We FOLLOW him through the store. By day he is the Assistant
text: Manager, by night he is a poet.
text: A MAN in his fifties, wearing a beret and a goatee is reading,
dialog: Charles Bukowski's, Playing The Piano Like a Percussive
text: Instrument, Until Your Fingers Begin To Bleed A Bit.
text: Charlie takes his place behind the cash register and resumes
text: writing in his handsome leather-bound poetry journal.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (sotto)
speaker_heading: O' SCOTLAND
text: YOUR SUCKLED TEET OF SHAME
text: CUSTOMER approaches.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Do you have the book On The Road by
dialog: Jack Kerouac?
text: Every day there is a steady stream of tourists who come in
text: to get copies of On The Road. Charlie is use to this and
text: without looking up he points to a huge, well marked display
text: of thousands of copies of On The Road. Another TOURIST COUPLE
dialog: approach.
speaker_heading: TOURIST
dialog: Do you have a copy of On The Road by
dialog: Jack Kerouac?
text: Again not looking up, Charlie just points.
speaker_heading: TOURIST
dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
text: Charlie puts the "CLOSED" sign on the door and proceeds to
dialog: walk home.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS
text: The sights and the sounds of the city are accentuated by the
text: BEBOP as he sees life, warts and all. As the streets become
text: less populated, he can now hear the sounds of his own
text: FOOTSTEPS and, a COUPLE BICKERING. The streets become even
text: more deserted. The night is closing in on him. A cat darts
text: out from an alleyway and startles him. He quickens his pace.
text: RUMBLINGS make him cross the street to avoid the danger.
text: Headlights of a slow moving car approach from the distance.
text: Charlie, frightened, turns another corner onto:
speaker_heading: HIS STREET
text: He approaches a 3-story Victorian home, in which he has an
text: apartment on the second floor, he notices a light on in his
text: window. A CRASHING sound from within.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: HANDS
text: taking papers out of a desk drawer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: carefully opening the front door and then gingerly closing
text: it. He reaches for a baseball bat in a nearby umbrella stand.
text: Sound of BREAKING GLASS from his apartment upstairs.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: SHATTERED PICTURE FRAME
text: with a photo of Charlie and an angelic blonde.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: finishing off the last two steps nearing the front door of
text: his apartment, bat raised above his head ready to swing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE HANDS
text: clasp a jewelry box on the top of the dresser and stuff them
text: into a dufflebag; the jewelry is followed by CD's.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: pushing open his apartment door in a mock SWAT maneuver,
text: then stealthily stalking toward the sound of the intruder in
text: the bedroom. He stubs his toe on a spring loaded doorstop
text: making a loud metal VITTSWINGGGG's sound. He freezes,
dialog: terrified.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE BEDROOM
text: where the HANDS, freeze.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Like a coiled jungle cat ready to pounce, waits two beats...
text: then springs Samurai style into...
speaker_heading: THE BEDROOM
text: He freezes.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL
text: that the HANDS belong to the angelic blonde in the broken
text: picture. It's Charlie's girlfriend, SHERRI.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sherri! What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: I'm leaving you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, thank God... I thought you were
dialog: robbing our own home, because frankly,
dialog: that's insane. I mean, what could
dialog: you possibly gain by robbing your
dialog: own home? I don't mean to meddle,
dialog: but isn't it better to rob other
dialog: peoples' homes? Start accumulating
dialog: their wealth as opposed to just
dialog: reaccumulating your own wealth.
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: That's not funny, Charlie. I'm really
dialog: leaving.
text: She continues to pack. Charlie tries to unpack her things.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?! Just because we had a fight
dialog: last night?
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: We've had a fight every night for
dialog: two months. Ever since I brought up
dialog: the subject of marriage, you've found
dialog: fault with everything I do. Why
dialog: couldn't we have gotten married,
dialog: Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm too young to get married.
dialog: (begins putting her
dialog: things back)
dialog: I'm only twenty-nine and a half. We
dialog: love living together.
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: It's been two years now. I need
dialog: something more.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: See, Sherri, this is frustrating for
dialog: me, okay. When we first started going
dialog: out I thought we agreed that we
dialog: weren't the sort of people who got
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: That's like saying we're not the
dialog: sort of people who are going to grow
dialog: old. We're not going to fall into
dialog: that "growing old" trap. Face it,
dialog: you've got a problem with commitment,
dialog: Charlie. Take a look at your other
dialog: girlfriends. Every time you get close
dialog: to a commitment there's something
dialog: wrong with them.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, I broke up with them for good
dialog: reasons.
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: What about Sandy?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sandy was an alcoholic.
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: No-no-no. You thought she was an
dialog: alcoholic. She just drank more than
dialog: you drank. What about Jill?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She hated my family.
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: You thought she hated your family.
dialog: Nobody hates your family. Everybody
dialog: loves your family. What about Julie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: She smelled like soup.
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She smelled exactly like Campbell's
text: Beef Vegetable soup. She was dirty,
dialog: physically dirty.
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: Well, Charlie, I wonder what you're
dialog: gonna say were my problems? Are you
dialog: gonna tell your friends that I was a
dialog: junkie, that I wasn't supportive
dialog: enough or that I smelled like relish?
dialog: Charlie, I loved you. It could have
dialog: worked out.
dialog: (she goes to the door)
dialog: Think about it.
text: She leaves.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON - THE BROKEN PICTURE
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - CHARLIE'S CAR - DUSK
text: Charlie and his best friend, TONY SPILETTI, are out for a
text: night on the town.
dialog: Tony is second generation Italian-American with very
dialog: Mediterranean features. They're listening to Teenage Fan
text: Club. They pass Ghierardeli Square.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tony, Teenage Fan Club, they're
dialog: Scottish you know?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I had that dream again.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Oh, is that the one where you suspect
text: that a fat man in a diaper, on a
dialog: lazy susan has interfered with your
dialog: plans for the evening?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, but I have had that one. No, in
dialog: this one I'm in love...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And I say to myself, 'I've finally
dialog: found somebody that I'm truly
dialog: comfortable with.' You know when
dialog: you're so comfortable that you'll
dialog: let them put makeup on you to see
dialog: what you would look like if you were
dialog: a girl. Anyways you know what I do
dialog: in the dream next?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You propose?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: No. I die.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: But Charlie, you're a normal suburban
dialog: guy at heart, from a normal suburban
dialog: family. Didn't you tell me you always
dialog: wanted to get married and have a
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, but, I'm afraid, okay? There
dialog: are seven main rites of passage in a
dialog: man's life. Birth, first day of
dialog: school, last day of school. Marriage.
dialog: Kids. Retirement. Death. I'm at
dialog: marriage. I'm two rites of passage
dialog: away from death.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
text: Tony is doing three-sixties, scoping out beauties, when
text: suddenly his roving eyes lock on a police car directly behind
text: them. He slouches down into his seat.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Christ. It's the cops.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tony, you are a cop.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I know. Isn't it awful? I work with
dialog: those guys. They're assholes.
text: The police car passes.
scene_heading: INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Tony and Charlie enter. There is a poet on stage. The club
text: is full of art tarts and college bohemians. They are greeted
text: by the club's owner, GIUSEPPI, an Italian man in his fifties.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Salve zio mio.
speaker_heading: UNCLE
dialog: Allora? Che catzo fai, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hi, Uncle Giuseppi.
speaker_heading: UNCLE
dialog: Tony, come' stai bello il tuo pappa
dialog: e' in galera per la terza volta.
text: Tony's uncle shows them to a table.
speaker_heading: UNCLE
dialog: I'll have the waitress bring you
dialog: cappuccino.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What did your uncle say?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: He says my Dad's back in jail again.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ah, I'm sorry, man.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You know, it's funny I don't even
dialog: feel related to my parents anymore.
dialog: I feel like your mom and dad are
dialog: more like my parents. I feel more
dialog: Scottish than Italian.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tony Spiletti, I don't think you
dialog: could get more Italian than that.
dialog: Unless of course your name was Tony
dialog: Italian Guy.
text: Charlie checks out the girls in the coffee bar.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm so bummed. Sherri was great,
dialog: wasn't she? I'm an asshole, aren't
dialog: I?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You've got to help me get through
dialog: this night.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You've just got to get back on the
dialog: horse.
text: The waitress arrives with two cappuccinos in extremely large
dialog: cups like they have in France.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Waitress, I'm sorry, there seems to
dialog: be a mistake. I ordered the large
dialog: cappuccino.
text: Two girls at a nearby table, laugh. Charlie and Tony exchange,
dialog: "This could be promising." looks.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to the girls)
dialog: Do you think these cups could be
text: larger? They're practically bowls.
text: The girls laugh again.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I feel like I'm having Campbell's
dialog: Cuppuccino.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Join us in a cup of coffee? There's
dialog: enough room?
speaker_heading: GIRLS
dialog: Sure!
text: The girls come over.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: My name's Susan and this is June. We
dialog: think you're funny.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: My name's Tony. This is my friend
dialog: Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look, Tony, I'm going home. See you
dialog: later, girls.
text: Tony grabs him and pulls him aside.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You really don't understand, do you?
dialog: When a girl comes over to your table
dialog: and says, 'I think you're funny.' It
dialog: means you've pretty much been given
dialog: the keys to the city. Charlie, this
dialog: is big.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Perhaps you've confused me with
dialog: someone who gives a shit. Here's
dialog: what's gonna happen, Tony. We'll end
dialog: up going out with them tonight, maybe
dialog: even home with them. Well go out for
dialog: two months. Soon she'll move in,
dialog: we'll be happy, She'll want more of
dialog: a commitment. I'll be terrified and
dialog: I'll do something to ruin it. Just
dialog: like I did with Sherri.
text: He leaves. Tony is left with the two girls.
speaker_heading: JUNE
dialog: Poor, guy... He seemed so nice.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (talking, choked up)
dialog: I just broke up with somebody as
dialog: well. She left me high and dry.
text: The girls try to comfort him.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT
text: Three quarters of the furnishings and items have disappeared
text: with Sherri. Charlie sits dejectedly on the floor over his
text: Poetry Journal. He is missing Sherri. We see...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE'S FACE
text: He looks out and is struck by an idea and begins to write.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE JOURNAL
speaker_heading: I AM LONELY
speaker_heading: CHARLIE'S FACE
text: Again he looks out, finds his inspiration and continues to
dialog: write
speaker_heading: IN THE JOURNAL
scene_heading: IT'S REALLY HARD
speaker_heading: CHARLIE'S FACE
text: A gentle tear rolls down his left cheek. He pauses, then
text: finishes off the stanza.
speaker_heading: IN THE JOURNAL
speaker_heading: THIS POEM SUCKS
text: After the last line he scratches out the entire poem. He
text: closes the book and turns on the TV set to CNN to veg out.
dialog: The show is "What's Cooking! With Burt Wolf."
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET
text: Charlie is driving in his car. He drives slowly looking for
text: an address. Finds it, slips in to a parking spot in front.
scene_heading: EXT. BUTCHER'S SHOP - MEATS OF THE WORLD
text: Adorning the front are a "GRAND OPENING" sign and miniature
text: flags of the world. Charlie goes inside.
scene_heading: INT. BUTCHER'S SHOP
text: It's a small, hip shop selling specialty meats from around
text: the world. Charlie looks around. Suddenly, an attractive
text: woman in her late twenties, wearing a blood-stained smock
text: enters. It is HARRIET MICHAELS. She has a cleaver in one
text: hand and something bloody in the other.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Goddamn shoplifter.
dialog: (conscious of Charlie's
dialog: presence; holding up
dialog: bloody meat)
dialog: But I got him!
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You're next.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (backing out the door;
dialog: terrified)
dialog: I've come at a bad time.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: No stay!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, no, really... Obviously you've
dialog: got things you have to do. You've
dialog: got to dismember the rest of his
text: bloody torso. Dig a makeshift shallow
text: grave. Cover the body with quick
dialog: lime. Really so much to do, so little
dialog: time and I'm only in the way here,
dialog: I'm just gonna go. Good luck.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (referring to meat in
dialog: hand)
dialog: Oh, this! Oh, no, this is what he
dialog: stole. This isn't a piece of him or
dialog: anything. This is Icelandic Shank.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I bet it goes well with a nice
dialog: Chianti. Fittfittfitt.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes. Do you have haggis?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Yes, we do. It's over here in our
dialog: Scottish Cuts section. One?
text: This is a section under glass flying a Scottish flag, with
text: haggis and various cuts of Scottish meat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes! I've never been able to find
dialog: haggis anywhere, except at my parents'
dialog: house. They're Scottish.
text: Harriet rounds the counter and wraps up the haggis. Behind
text: her is the large "PRUSSIAN VENISON" sign.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (ringing up his order)
dialog: That'll be fifteen, seventy-nine.
dialog: Will there be anything else?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes. I know it's a long shot, but
dialog: you wouldn't by any chance happen to
dialog: have any Prussian Venison?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Now where in the world would I get
dialog: Prussian Venison?
text: Charlie's charmed.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET
text: Charlie is driving along listening to Kerouac. We absorb the
text: flavor of San Francisco as he drives down Lombard Street.
scene_heading: EXT. CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: An old crappie apartment building in San Francisco. Charlie's
text: car pulls up. We hear "SATURDAY NIGHT" by the Bay City
dialog: Rollers.
scene_heading: INT. OUTER HALLWAY OF CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Charlie approaches a door.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (calling up)
dialog: Mom, Dad, I'm here.
speaker_heading: STUART (O.S.)
dialog: We're in here, son.
text: The apartment is a shrine to Scotland. Scottish paraphernalia,
text: miniature Scotty dogs, shortbread tins and, on wall, framed
text: pictures depict famous Scotsmen, Sean Connery, Jackie Stewart,
dialog: Alexander Graham Bell, James Doohan (Scottie from "Star
dialog: Trek"), Sheena Easton, Billy Connolly.
scene_heading: CHARLIE'S POV - AS WE ENTER THE LIVING ROOM
text: We see STUART, MAY, TONY, and little WILLIAM, Charlie's
dialog: fourteen year old little brother all singing:
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: (singing)
scene_heading: S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y... NIGHT
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: (noticing Charlie)
dialog: Come give your old man a kiss or
dialog: I'll kick your teeth in.
text: The group are eating dinner on TV trays. Charlie walks over
text: and turns off the record.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Charlie, put on Charlie Pride, would
dialog: ya? Oh, I love Charlie Pride.
dialog: (begins singing; in
dialog: thick Scottish accent)
text: HEY, DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THE MOST
text: BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD...
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: May, shut it.
text: STUART MACKENZIE is in his late fifties, a butcher, with
text: Coke bottle glasses and thick head of black hair. His red-
text: haired wife, MAY, is in her fifties, attractive with a soft,
text: but tough appearance. Little WILLIAM, has a very large head
text: and a skinny neck. Like Charlie, he was born in America.
text: Charlie gives his Mom a hug, his father a kiss.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, William.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
text: (on his stomach on
dialog: the floor; watching
dialog: TV)
dialog: Hey, Charlie.
speaker_heading: STUART
scene_heading: SCORES! MAGIC GOAL!
text: On the television, Stuart's team, Glasgow Celtic, has scored.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Aye -- magic.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Let's have a look at the re-play.
dialog: William, move your head. Look at the
dialog: size of that ooy's heed. I'm not
dialog: kidding. It's like an orange on a
dialog: tooth pick.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Stuart, you're going to give the boy
dialog: a complex.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I'm not kidding. That's a huge
dialog: noggin'. It has it's own weather
dialog: system. It's a virtual planetoid.
dialog: (shouting to William)
dialog: Heed! Move!
text: We see the re-play of the goal on TV. Tony sits down and May
text: brings over a plate of stew and three types of potatoes,
text: piled very high.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Is that enough potatoes, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Enough to recreate Devil's Tower in
dialog: "Close Encounters".
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: (sniffs the air)
dialog: Do I smell haggis?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Aye, you do.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: (taking it)
dialog: I'll put it in the frig.
text: Charlie notices Tony reading some papers. He realizes it's
text: literature from the Lyndon H. LaRouche Society.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Dad, what are you doing to Tony now?
dialog: Why do you abuse his mind like this?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: That's the latest report from Lyndon
dialog: H. LaRouche, outlining how the Queen
dialog: and the Rothschilds masterminded the
dialog: Soviet overthrow, so that they could
dialog: reclaim lands they had annexed during
dialog: the Holy Roman Empire.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (goading Charlie)
dialog: You know a lot of this makes sense.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I think you're suffering from the
dialog: Stockholm Syndrome, where the hostages
text: start to relate to their captors.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Listen, Sonny Jim, it's a known fact
dialog: there's a society of the five
dialog: wealthiest people in the world, called
dialog: the Pentaverate, who run everything
dialog: and meet three times a year at a
dialog: secret country mansion in Colorado,
dialog: known as "The Meadows."
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: And that's obviously why we haven't
dialog: heard about it in the newspapers.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: (inappropriately angry
dialog: &amp; loud)
dialog: That's right. They fuckin' own the
dialog: papers, smartass. And everything
dialog: else. Why do you think Scotland's
dialog: not been able to get independence?
dialog: Because the Queen the Pentavirate
dialog: and those English dome heads in West
dialog: Minster won't have it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Who are the other members of this
dialog: pentaverate?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: The Queen, the Rothchilds, the Gettys,
dialog: the Vatican, and Colonel Sanders
dialog: before he went tits up. Oh, I hated
text: the Colonel with his wee beady eyes.
text: And that smug look on his face.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Dad how can you hate "the Colonel?"
speaker_heading: STUART
text: Because the Colonel puts an addictive
dialog: chemical in it that makes you crave
dialog: it fortnightly.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Interesting... coo-coo
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Would anyone like a juice? Charlie,
dialog: did I tell you, we bought a Juice
dialog: Tiger?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: A Juice Tiger?
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Aye, it's a juicer. It's part of my
dialog: National Enquirer, Garth Brooks diet.
dialog: Would you like potato juice?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thank you, no.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Sherri's late.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, uh, Sherri and I broke up.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Oh, you didn't. Sherri was the
dialog: daughter your father was never able
dialog: to give me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm just not ready for marriage. I'm
dialog: twenty-nine and my poems haven't
dialog: even been published yet.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: But it's not just the poetry is it
dialog: son? You're afraid if you get married
dialog: you'll lose your muse. Look at me, I
text: was a strapping young butcher, at
dialog: the height of my creative powers.
dialog: When it came to de-boning a side of
dialog: beef, there was nobody that could
dialog: touch me. Then I married your mother.
dialog: And people would still stand in awe
text: as I filleted a shoulder of lamb.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Maybe it's just as well not to get
dialog: married, look at the news. Where did
dialog: I put it?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Heed. Move that melon of yours into
dialog: the bathroom and get the paper for
dialog: your mother.
text: William gets the National Enquirer and brings it back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's not news, Dad. That's bullshit.
dialog: I wouldn't wipe my ass with that
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: What are you talking about? It's the
dialog: fifth highest circulating paper in
dialog: the United States, I'll have you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Oh, here it is. Mrs. X. The Honeymoon
dialog: Murderer. She marries men under fake
text: identities, and then murders them.
dialog: She killed some German martial arts
dialog: expert, and some plumber named Ralph
text: Elliot. Her whereabouts are unknown.
text: There's another goal on the TV set.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Scores! Two nil. Magic!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Ah, beautiful goal. We HOLD on the
dialog: TV set.
text: Time passes. The TV set
speaker_heading: CROSS FADES:
text: TO THE END OF THE GAME
text: The two teams are shaking hands. And the final scores chyron
text: shows Celtic beating Rangers three nothing. We see Charlie
text: and Tony are leaving. Stuart is blind drunk.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: (singing Rod Stewart's
dialog: song)
dialog: YOU'RE IN MY EYES, YOU'RE IN MY
dialog: DREAMS...
dialog: YOU'RE CELTIC, UNITED
dialog: AND BABY I'VE DECIDED...
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Ah, you're steaming.
text: She meets Charlie and Tony at the door and kisses him good-
text: bye. She turns to kiss Tony, and holds on the kiss far too
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (pulling away)
dialog: See you later, Mrs. MacKenzie.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Oh, you've turned into a sexy Italian
dialog: bastard.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: See you later, mom.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: See you later, Dad.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Fine. Go! You've stayed your hour.
text: Charlie and Tony leave and enter...
speaker_heading: THE HALLWAY
text: where they find William sitting on the stairs waiting for
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Take me with you.
scene_heading: EXT. MEATS OF THE WORLD - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Charlie's drives by and notices Harriet, who's unwinding the
text: store awning in Dutch national costume. The banner announces
text: "DUTCH WEEK." "MEATS OF THE WORLD SALUTES DUTCH MEAT."
text: Charlie slows down to look at her. She looks great in her

speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ON THE PAD

speaker_heading: OH MEAT MAID,

speaker_heading: THEMSELVES
speaker_heading: WILLINGLY
speaker_heading: FOR A CHANCE

scene_heading: EXT. MEATS OF THE WORLD
text: Charlie's car pulls up. The sign reads, "WELSH WEEK" "MEATS
text: OF THE WORLD SALUTES WELSH MEATS"
scene_heading: INT. MEATS OF THE WORLD
text: The store is very busy. There is a line at the meat counter
text: seven people deep. Charlie takes his place at the end of the
dialog: line.
text: We see a montage of a persons hands chopping a rack of lamb
text: into lamb chops, and carving meat with surgical efficiency.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (spotting Charlie in
dialog: the crowd)
dialog: Oh, hi haggis, right?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It was a big hit.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (finishing up with a
dialog: customer)
dialog: I remember you told me you were
dialog: Scottish, but do you really like
dialog: haggis.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No. I think it's repellent in every
dialog: way. In fact, I think most Scottish
dialog: cuisine is based on a dare.
text: Harriet laughs.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (to the next customer)
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: Sorry, I'm really busy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look, um, my dad's a butcher, do you
dialog: need a hand?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Well, actually, Yes.
text: Charlie puts on a very stylish butcher smock and crosses
text: behind the counter.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Can you get me four Belgian
dialog: porterhouses? Do you know what a
dialog: porterhouse looks like?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm meat literate.
text: Time passes we see a montage of Harriet and Charlie serving
text: customers. Ending on a customer's POV of Charlie.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER (O.S.)
dialog: Yes, do you have any fresh blubber?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll check.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You want blubber, right?
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Yeah.
text: We see Charlie's POV of an Eskimo with a "lower forty-eighth"
dialog: accent.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: My parents are coming to town. You
dialog: know how parents are. They'll drive
dialog: you nuts.
text: The Eskimo exits, there are no customers left.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Look, I'm really grateful. Can I
dialog: offer you some meat as payment?
dialog: Please, help yourself to some meat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm trying to be a vegetarian.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Trying to be a vegetarian?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, the problem is I really love
dialog: hot-dogs.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I think the meat industry invented
dialog: hot-dogs to stop people from becoming
dialog: vegetarians. There's got to be
dialog: something I can do to repay you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You could take me to a nice romantic
dialog: dinner.
scene_heading: EXT. PIER - NIGHT
text: Charlie and Harriet are eating hot-dogs. As Charlie puts the
text: relish on, he smells the relish.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (sniffing the relish)
dialog: This reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I hate talking about old
dialog: relationships.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Then let's not and say we did.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (she laughs)
dialog: That was easy -- What a nice guy.
dialog: You've probably never done a mean
dialog: thing in your life.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You'd be surprised.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I'd like to hear.
dialog: (to his confused look)
dialog: Name me something bad you've done in
dialog: your life.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Are you kidding me?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: No. Did you ever steal anything? You
dialog: ever hit someone?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, I've been in fights. Let me
dialog: think.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (as Charlie thinks)
dialog: Not one bad thing, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tell me something bad you've done.
dialog: And it better be bad. I mean, evil.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: How evil?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Really evil.
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Like how many people have you brutally
dialog: murdered?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: "Brutal" is such a subjective word.
dialog: I mean, what's brutal to one person
dialog: might be totally reasonable to
dialog: another.
text: Next to them is a German couple, speaking German, looking
text: through a coin-operated binocular. He says something which
text: causes her to cry.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This just reminded her of that scene
dialog: in "Brian's Song".
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Actually, he just proposed to her.
dialog: Those are tears of joy.
text: She lifts her soda to toast them.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Prost.
text: The man and woman smile and nod.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Danke, Fraulein.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're very smart. It's a shame I'm
dialog: going to have to destroy you.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Do bright women intimidate you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, not at all.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Really, what do you look for in women
dialog: you date?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Well, I know everyone always say
dialog: "sense of humor", but I'd have to go
dialog: with breast size.
dialog: (she laughs)
dialog: How about you? In a guy.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Income of course, and then...
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: ...savings.
text: He smiles at her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Me likey how you thinkey.
scene_heading: INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The lights turn on, and then they enter a very bohemian
text: apartment. There is artists paraphernalia strewn around. A
text: small bar separates the living area from the kitchen. She
text: smiles and walks off into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I'll make us some tea.
text: He checks out her apartment. On the wall there is a huge
text: poster of the BOARDWALK IN ATLANTIC CITY.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, you know what this apartment
dialog: needs? A really large oversized poster
dialog: of Atlantic City.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I used to live there. That's where I
dialog: had my first supermarket job.
text: On his way out, he peeks into the bedroom, where he finds a
text: bed that is facing neither parallel nor perpendicular with
text: the wall. It is just kind of "there".
speaker_heading: HARRIET (O.S.)
dialog: (coming into room)
dialog: I only have chamomile. I hope that's
dialog: all right.
text: He looks at her and then at the "Oddly-placed" bed.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: It's North-South.
dialog: (to his confused look)
dialog: For health reasons. See... I had
dialog: this friend, he was a martial arts
dialog: expert. Anyways, he used to sleep
dialog: North-South. I don't know... It's a
dialog: martial arts thing and it just sort
dialog: of became a habit with me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (walking into living
dialog: room)
dialog: You know Scotland has it's own martial
dialog: arts. It's called FUCKU. It's mostly
text: head butting and kicking people when
text: they're on the ground.
text: Harriet starts laughing. Then so does Charlie. They lean
text: into each other. Pretty close. Too close even, and when it
text: seems like they're going to kiss, Charlie suddenly gets
text: uncomfortable and looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Late?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No. No. Not for me.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Who for then?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Who for then what?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Well, you looked at your watch and
dialog: said it wasn't late for you... I
dialog: wondered who it was late for.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Not me. No, Sir. Not here.
dialog: (after a pause;
dialog: checking watch)
dialog: Maybe it is late.
text: She gets him his coat. He starts to leave.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look, the truth is, yes, I had a
dialog: great time, and I'd like to kiss
dialog: you, but if we do kiss, then we'll
dialog: kiss on the couch and if we kiss on
dialog: the couch, then we'll kiss in the
dialog: bedroom, and once you're in the
dialog: bedroom -- Well, the thing is, I
dialog: always rush it. And this time I feel
dialog: like maybe I should wait. Maybe we
dialog: should let it build naturally and
dialog: grow, instead of just immediately
text: spending the night together.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I want to spend the night together.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (sold)
dialog: I have no problem with that.
scene_heading: THE BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
text: They are both fast asleep. She is curled up in his arms.
text: Suddenly, she begins to speak.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Yes! Yes!
text: Charlie's eyes open. He smiles.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Yes Ralph. I will. Ralph.
text: Charlie's smile fades. He sits up and looks at her. She is
text: lying completely still on the bed, her eyes closed, and still
dialog: sleep-talking.
speaker_heading: HARRIET (O.S.)
dialog: Now now Ralph!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (waking her)
dialog: Harriet...? Harriet...?
dialog: (as her eyes open)
dialog: You were having a dream, or...? You
dialog: kept saying the name Ralph.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Ralph?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ralph. I heard you say it.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (sleepily)
dialog: That's odd. Just today I was thinking
dialog: about, her. She's a friend.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (starting to leave)
dialog: Is she nice --? Ralph...
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Yeah. She's great.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO:
scene_heading: INT. HARRIET'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Charlie is sleeping alone in the bed, and the sound of RUNNING
text: WATER is heard off in the distance. His eyes slowly open, he
text: looks around, remembers where he is. He puts on his shorts
text: and walks towards the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Through the steam we can just make out Harriet in the shower
text: washing her hair. Charlie walks over.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know... with this drought in
dialog: California total strangers are urged
dialog: to shower together.
text: He opens the curtain. It's not Harriet. The woman, ROSE,
text: calmly looks at him and closes the curtain.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Go away.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh God. I'm sorry. Jesus. Excuse me.
text: He backs out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT
text: The door opens and a hurriedly dressed Charlie emerges. Before
text: he gets to the door he once again encounters Rose. She's
text: completely dressed. Even her hair is dry.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hi. I'm really sorry. I must have
dialog: scared the... I'm Harriet's friend,
dialog: Charlie, and you must be...
dialog: (hopefully)
dialog: Ralph?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I'm Harriet's sister, Rose. And this
text: is Harriet's note.
text: He reaches for it, but she reads it aloud to him.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (reading)
dialog: 'Dear Charlie, I didn't want to wake
dialog: you, make yourself at home, thanks
dialog: for making me smile.' Harriet.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's a very nice note.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I'll make you some breakfast.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Gee, I'd love to but I'm running
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: What would you say to blueberry
dialog: pancakes, bacon, fresh squeezed grape
dialog: juice and Kona coffee?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER
text: Charlie and Rose sit at the table each eating a bowl of dry
dialog: cereal.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I'm sorry I didn't have any of those
dialog: other things.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, that stuff'll kill you while
text: Fruit Loops are light and probably
dialog: reasonably high in Fiber. I like
dialog: Apple Jacks too.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Got 'em.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So this is your apartment?
text: Rose starts sketching Charlie.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yes. She's been here the past three
dialog: months... ever since she came back
dialog: from Miami. I used to visit her
dialog: occasionally. She didn't speak of
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (shakes his head, no)
dialog: She told me about a martial arts guy
dialog: and there was some discussion about
dialog: Ralph...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: She spoke of them...?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She spoke of the martial arts guy
dialog: and screamed about Ralph...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (affectionately)
dialog: Well, you know Harriet.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Actually, I really don't.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: But you did have sex with her?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yet you still don't know her.
dialog: (contemplates this)
dialog: See, that's the problem with sex.
dialog: It's not very revealing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: My, look at the time.
text: He stands up.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: You should be careful, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I am... usually. I just... You should
dialog: know, this is very unusual that I
dialog: would do this so soon, in this day
dialog: and age particularly, but... We just
dialog: really hit it off. We did. And...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I'm gonna go now. I won't tell Harriet
dialog: that anything happened.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But... nothing did happen.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Exactly. Or she would be jealous.
dialog: And when she gets jealous, we both
dialog: know what she's capable of.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, we don't. You do, like I said, I
dialog: just met her.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You'll be okay, Charlie. Just be
dialog: careful.
text: She leaves. Charlie is baffled.
scene_heading: INT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - DAY
text: As Charlie walks by, FRED, a lanky customer in his late teens
text: is buying a book.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Hey, Charlie. How you doin'?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Good. Good. Look, Fred...
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: You got a lot of girlfriends, right?
dialog: You know any girls named Ralph?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Ralph? Gee, Charlie. Isn't that a
dialog: guy's name?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, not necessarily, but... Never
dialog: mind. Thanks, Fred.
text: Charlie catches the store manager, PENNY, on her way into
dialog: her office.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey Penny, I wanted to ask you --
dialog: you know some girls named Ralph,
dialog: right? I mean, that's a girl's name
dialog: also, isn't it?
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: I don't think so, Charlie... Uh...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: Forget it. Thanks.
text: She walks into her office totally confused.

speaker_heading: TONY (V.O.)
dialog: You know I've lived in this city all
dialog: my life and I've never been to
dialog: Alcatraz.
speaker_heading: ALCATRAZ
text: We open on the LOUD BANGING of a CELL DOOR. We find our tour
text: group in the holding area. The PARK RANGER is a beefy man in
text: his late fifties and talks with emotionless, military
dialog: precision.
speaker_heading: PARK RANGER
dialog: Hello, everyone I'm a park ranger
dialog: and I will be leading you on the
dialog: tour. All the park rangers here at
dialog: Alcatraz were at one time guards,
dialog: myself included. My name is John
dialog: Johnson, but everyone here calls me
dialog: Vicki. Will you please follow me?
text: They are led out. We see that Alcatraz is a sinister place.
text: Cold and unforgiving. The Park Ranger leads them to the center
text: of a cell block.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You're glowing, Charlie. The man's
dialog: in love.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sssh... Stop it. I'm trying to listen.
speaker_heading: PARK RANGER
dialog: This is the main cell block area.
dialog: Home to such famous criminals as Al
dialog: Capone, Micky Cohen, Joseph "Dutch"
dialog: Critzer, and Robert Stroud, the famous
dialog: Bird Man of Alcatraz. Follow me,
dialog: please.
text: The Park Ranger leads them past the famous visiting rooms,
text: the mess hall, all the way to the solitary confinement area.
speaker_heading: A CELL
speaker_heading: PARK RANGER
dialog: This is the cell for solitary
dialog: confinement, that over the years has
dialog: come to be known as Times Square.
text: Tony and Charlie are at the back of the tour group.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: So did you and Harriet?... you know...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Sssh I don't want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: With that look, you don't have to
dialog: talk about it. The grin alone could
dialog: get you five to seven years.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tony, get your mind out of the gutter.
dialog: All you need to know is that she's a
dialog: sweet, kind and loving person.
speaker_heading: PARK RANGER
dialog: Now this is something none of the
dialog: other tour guides will tell you. In
dialog: this particular cell block Machine
dialog: Gunn Kelly had, what we call in the
dialog: prison system, a "bitch." And one
text: day, in a jealous rage, Kelly took a
dialog: makeshift knife, or "shiv," and cut
text: out his "bitch's" eyes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look, what can I tell you. I'm
dialog: smitten. I'm in deep smit. I dunno.
dialog: I just don't wanna talk about it,
dialog: because then I start analyzing and
dialog: that's not good for me.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Good. I think that's good. Just let
dialog: it happen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Exactly. That's what's gonna be
dialog: different this time. Something strange
dialog: happens, let it go. It's not my
dialog: business... Like Ralph. She says
text: Ralph in her sleep.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Who's Ralph?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't know who Ralph is. Moreover,
dialog: I don't want to know.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: PARK RANGER
dialog: And as if blinding his "bitch" wasn't
dialog: enough retribution for Kelly, the
text: next day he and four other inmates
dialog: took turns pissing into the "bitch's"
dialog: ocular cavity.
text: Tony and Charlie look at each other. They're a little queasy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Exactly.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Tony, I'm happy. Don't let me screw
dialog: this one up.
scene_heading: INT. EL TORO - IN THE MISSION - DAY
text: They are eating Bay burrites.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Did you have a nice date last night?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Rose, I don't really --
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: He disturbed me while I was naked in
dialog: the shower this morning.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Yeah, he stayed over?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I didn't mind. Charlie and I laughed
dialog: about it over breakfast.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: That's good.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: He said you had great sex last night.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: He did?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: He seems really stuck on you. I hope
dialog: for you that it lasts.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Rose he's a sweet, kind and loving
dialog: person. We like each other, but I
dialog: don't want to think any further.
dialog: It's taken me a long time to get
dialog: back to dating, and I want to take
text: things real steady this time.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Well, you can trust me not to tell
dialog: him anything.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: He was quite happy not to talk about
dialog: the past.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I did a sketch of him.
text: Rose shows the sketch to Harriet.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (looking at the picture)
dialog: That's good.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Think I've caught him?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: The eyes are good.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Charlie really liked it.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: It's a good likeness.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Boy, I really hope it works out.
speaker_heading: HARRIET

scene_heading: INT. HARRIET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, uh... Ralph...?
speaker_heading: DELIVERY GUY
dialog: (turning around)
dialog: I'm Gilbert.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: HARRIET'S DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: She opens the door enough to see that she is wearing only a
text: blouse that goes below her hips. She looks fantastic. He
text: hands her the poetry books.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (teasing him)
dialog: Charlie, they're beautiful. I'll put
dialog: them right in water.
text: He follows her inside and puts the books on the bureau. He
text: goes over and kisses her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You look great.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I was just getting dressed.
dialog: (picking up skirt off
dialog: couch)
dialog: What do you think of this skirt?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Honestly?
dialog: (pulls her close)
dialog: I'd leave it off.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: So then you think I could go to a
dialog: poetry concert like this?
text: She drops the skirt and stands there. She's fantastic.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Let's forget the poetry concert.
dialog: It's already been nine hours since I
dialog: last made love to you.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (smiling; walking
dialog: away)
dialog: Come on we're meeting your best
dialog: friend. I wanna look good. The second
dialog: I go to the ladies room he's gonna
dialog: tell you what he really thinks of
dialog: me.
text: He follows her to the bedroom door, constantly trying to
text: kiss her.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Come on, Charlie. We have to be there
dialog: in fifteen minutes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (following her into
dialog: bedroom)
dialog: Fifteen minutes. Perfect.
text: She closes the door on his face.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (through door)
dialog: Maybe later.
speaker_heading: ROSE (O.S.)
dialog: I thought of calling you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Aaaahhh!
text: Charlie turns on his heel. Rose has appeared out of nowhere.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: To warn you, Charlie.
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: There are just some things you should
dialog: know, about Harriet.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: About Harriet?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: About her past.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't wanna know. I mean, look
dialog: everyone has some skeletons in their
dialog: past. I only care about the future.
dialog: Not the past.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Here's the thing. I may have to tell
dialog: Harriet.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tell her what?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: That we're lovers.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We're not lovers.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I know, and it's a damn shame.
text: Harriet walks in the room, fully dressed, and fully dazzling.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I hope I'm not interrupting.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (feeling weird)
dialog: No, not at all. We were just talking
dialog: about... Rose and I met yesterday,
dialog: so...
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: So I heard.
text: Harriet hugs Rose and then stands right next to her.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: So, don't you think we look alike?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Oh, we do not. Harriet was always
dialog: prettier than me. And a heck of a
dialog: lot more popular. She always had
dialog: boyfriends. The only thing I ever
dialog: got was good grades.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (slightly uncomfortable)
dialog: Good grades are good.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: She's just being kind. Show Charlie
dialog: one of your photographs, Rose. Rose
dialog: is a great artist.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: No, Harriet. I don't want to. They're
dialog: not good.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: You're so modest. If I weren't here
dialog: to brag for you, I just don't know...
dialog: (taking out a
dialog: posterboard from
dialog: cabinet)
dialog: Show it to him, Rose. Do it.
text: He turns it over and there is a picture there. A collage of
text: unrelated images put together. And it is beautiful.
text: But it's very abstract. Violent perhaps. Confused definitely.
dialog: He likes it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's beautiful...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I dunno.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What do you call it?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I dunno.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: A lot artists don't like to title
dialog: their work. They feel it biases the
dialog: viewer.
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: It is titled. It's called "I dunno".
text: Charlie looks at it again, then at Rose, then at Harriet.
text: It's all a little bizarre, but in a funny way he feels for
text: Rose. A hidden talented overshadowed by her sister's beauty.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: We should get going, Charlie. Thanks,
dialog: Rose... See you later.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Bye, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Rose, great to see you. We should
dialog: all go out together some time. The
dialog: three of us. That would be great.
dialog: That would be... interesting.
text: Charlie and Harriet walk out.
scene_heading: EXT. POETRY FESTIVAL - NIGHT
text: Charlie and Harriet wait in line with bohemian types and
text: poetry lovers from the suburbs, and all walks of life.
text: Directly behind them are TWO OLD LADIES. The marquee reads:
scene_heading: "POETRY FESTIVAL - TONIGHT ALLEN GINSBERG."
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I think you're going to love Alan
dialog: Ginsberg. He's great.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Oh, I know all about him.
speaker_heading: TONY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Charlie!
text: Tony is getting out of a cab accompanied by Susan, the girl
text: from Spiletti's Coffee House. He approaches Charlie.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Sorry we're late.
text: Tony throws his arms wide open and hugs one of the Little
text: Old Ladies on the other side of Charlie.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You must be Harriet. I've heard a
dialog: lot about you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Tony; re: Harriet)
dialog: This is Harriet.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Oh. Sorry. Of course.
dialog: (whispering to Harriet)
dialog: I apologize. Charlie described you
text: as much older. And heavier.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Oh, he did...?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thank you, Tony. This is my best
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: And this is Susan. Charlie, you
dialog: remember her from Uncle Giuseppi's.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, I do.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're funny...
text: Then she GIGGLES. The girls start inside, Tony lags back
dialog: with Charlie.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (whispers to Charlie)
dialog: I give Susan one night.
scene_heading: INT. POETRY FESTIVAL - NIGHT
text: ALLEN GINSBERG is on stage. He is brilliant. Tony, Charlie,
text: and Harriet are all amused. Susan is bored stiff. Charlie is
text: looking at Tony. Tony glances over at Susan and gives Charlie
text: an "Oh, well." look. Then he looks at Harriet and nods in
dialog: approval of her.
scene_heading: EXT. FISHERMAN'S WHARF - NIGHT
text: The four of them walk along the wharf. Charlie is at one of
dialog: those arcade games where you throw bean bags at the puppets
text: and try and knock them down. Charlie knocks two down.
speaker_heading: ARCADE MAN
dialog: One more and you get your pick.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Harriet)
dialog: You do it.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: No, Charlie. I'm the worst.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Come on, you'll be great...
text: The arcade man turns around to watch. Harriet winds up and
text: throws the bean bag directly into his neck.
speaker_heading: ARCADE MAN
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Sorry... I told you Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, no, you're okay, you're just
dialog: having control problems.
text: They both start laughing. He puts his arm around her. In the
text: b.g. the wounded arcade man is being led away by a co-worker.
text: They continued down the boardwalk stand in front of a House
dialog: of Horrors.
text: It looks somewhat run down and Harriet looks questioningly
dialog: at Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know this is really, really cheesy,
dialog: but in a way this is one of the places
dialog: in San Francisco I'm most proud of.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Yeah, let's go in.
text: Tony nods agreement. Susan looks bored. They go inside the
speaker_heading: HOUSE OF HORRORS
text: it's as low rent as Charlie described. The "KEEPER OF THE
text: THRESHOLD" so described in a poorly written sign, is an
text: overweight man in his late twenties, wearing jeans and a
text: denim jacket and a little bit of scary makeup. He looks like
text: a roadie for the band, KISS. He stands at a podium, smoking
text: and reading a paper. As Charlie, Tony, Harriet and Susan
text: pass the Threshold Keeper, he takes a casual drag of his
text: cigarette, lets out a little smoke and with zero commitment
dialog: utters:
scene_heading: THRESHOLD KEEPER
dialog: Boo.
scene_heading: INT. WAX MUSEUM - DAY
text: Harriet and Charlie enter Bill's Wax Museum. The OWNER of
text: the wax museum greets them.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Hi. I'm Bill, welcome to my wax
dialog: museum.
text: They walk over to the exhibits. There are exhibits of Abraham
text: Lincoln, Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton. As they look more
text: closely they notice that the faces are exactly the same as
text: Bill's. They laugh.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Pouring rain. THUNDER. Charlie and Harriet, wrapped in each
text: others arms, walking through the rain.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I feel so safe with you right now.
dialog: You're never going to leave me, are
dialog: you? I feel like I could be here
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: THE REFLECTION OF RAIN ON CHARLIE'S PANIC-STRICKEN FACE
text: PULL BACK to see Charlie in bed. He lies awake on his side,
text: his back up to Harriet's. She is sound asleep. Suddenly:
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (sleeptalking)
dialog: Ralph! No, Ralph!
text: Charlie sighs, then just shrugs and tries to fall asleep.
dialog: What can he do.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S PARENTS' APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Charlie and Harriet wait outside his parents' door.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, this is it.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: It'll be fine.
text: They enter the door.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S PARENT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: We again move along the hallway. We pass the Scottish wall,
dialog: of fame, Scottie from "Star Trek", Sir Walter Scott, Sir
text: Harry Lauder, Sheena Easton, Al Pacino, Billy Connolly, then
text: the CAMERA BACKTRACKS to Pacino, where it HOLDS MOMENTARILY.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mom, Dad, we're here.
text: May comes up, wearing a fancy country and western outfit.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Ah, Charlie is this the wee Harriet.
dialog: Ah, she's beautiful.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: She's so sweet. I hope you keep her.
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Stuart, come out here. You tube.
text: When he comes up, Stuart is wearing only a shirt with his
dialog: boxer shorts.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Ah, it's the wee Harriet.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Stuart, put your pants on.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Hold your horses.
dialog: (calling to William)
dialog: Heed! Pants!
text: William comes around the corner with his pants.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Dad, what's Al Pacino doing on the
dialog: Scottish wall of fame?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Oh, that's for Tony. So, Charlie
dialog: tells me you're a butcher. Let's
dialog: talk meat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Dad, no one wants to talk shop.
dialog: Especially butcher shop.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Come here.
text: Stuart gets him in a half-Nelson.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ah! Dad, dad I have a back zit, man
dialog: it kills.
text: Charlie struggles to free himself. Stuart turns to greet
text: Harriet. As he reaches out his hand.
text: Totally instinctively, Harriet grabs Stuart's hand and twists
text: it behind his back. Charlie is startled, as his date has
dialog: just gotten Stuart into a Half-Nelson.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (releasing his hand)
dialog: I'm sorry. I just... You just
dialog: surprised me. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I like this one Charlie. She's quite
dialog: a filly.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I'm really embarrassed.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Don't be embarrassed about having a
dialog: good strong butcher's grip. Do you
dialog: link your own sausage?
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Oh, ignore him. Come have a look at
dialog: some photos of Charlie when he was a
dialog: wee'n.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh Mom, don't start with the pictures.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Ah, Charlie, lighten up. You've got
dialog: a pickle up your ass.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (whispering to Harriet)
dialog: I'm gonna use the bathroom. You be
dialog: okay alone with them?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: Fine. Don't worry about it. Hurry.
text: They smile as he leaves the room.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Make sure there's paper, Charlie.
text: Charlie picks up the pace, scared of what he might hear next.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Make sure you leave the seat down.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (shutting her up)
dialog: Ma, just show her the pictures.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: And light a match.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: (to Harriet)
dialog: He always leaves the seat up. He's
dialog: gotta learn.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM AT PARENTS' - NIGHT
text: He closes the door, and shakes his head. What can he do?
text: Those are his parents. On the wall opposite the toilet is a
text: well-used dart board with pictures of the Queen Mother and
text: Colonel Sanders. Hooked to the magazine caddie is a small
text: container of darts.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: May excitedly shows Harriet family photo albums.
speaker_heading: MAY
text: This is Charlie with his Uncle Ecky.
dialog: He's a policeman in Canada. And our
dialog: cousins Ruth and Jack. He's just got
text: a restraining order from his wife.
dialog: She's a lovely girl. This is Billy.
dialog: He's a member of parliament. He
dialog: drinks.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: What a nice family you have.
text: CHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM
text: He doesn't seem in any hurry to leave either. He listens
text: through the door to Harriet enthusiastically looking through
dialog: old photos.
text: Charlie glances down at a stack of National Enquirers on the
text: magazine rack. He flips through a few.
text: He sees one of the absurd headlines: "ALIEN UFO SEX DIET"
text: Charlie shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HARRIET (O.S.)
dialog: (through door)
dialog: Charlie was the cutest baby.
speaker_heading: STUART (O.S.)
dialog: (through door)
dialog: You okay in there, Charlie? You didn't
dialog: fall in, did you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (through door)
dialog: Jesus...
text: Charlie then looks down at another article in the Enquirer
dialog: and reads:
scene_heading: "WHO'S NEXT FOR MRS. X - THE HONEYMOON KILLER?"
text: It is the article about Mrs. X -- the axe-murderer who kills
text: her husbands on their honeymoons and then marries again under
dialog: a different identity.
scene_heading: IN THE LIVING ROOM
text: May is quickly flipping through a photo album, pointing out
text: pictures of relatives as she goes:
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I can't believe the resemblance
dialog: between you and Charlie, Mrs.
dialog: MacKenzie.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE IN THE BATHROOM
text: With Harriet speaking in the b.g., Charlie continues reading,
dialog: now absorbed in the article about the 3 victims:
speaker_heading: HARRIET (O.S.)
dialog: (through door)
dialog: You have the same smile. It's so
dialog: incredible.
scene_heading: "VICTIM #1 - THE GERMAN MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT FROM MIAMI"
scene_heading: "VICTIM #2 - THE LOUNGE SINGER FROM ATLANTIC CITY"
scene_heading: "VICTIM #3 - THE SAN FRANCISCO PLUMBER - RALPH ELLIOT"
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - NIGHT - C.U. - HARRIET'S FACE
text: Sitting in the front seat of Charlie's car, smiling, content,
dialog: a great meal, a great night out with Charlie and a nice
text: evening with his parents.
text: Slowly PAN across the front seat to Charlie. A nervous anxious
text: "what the hell am I getting myself into" look on his face.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So, that was some move you put on my
dialog: Dad, there. Did you study Karate,
dialog: or...?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: No. Not officially. I dated a guy
dialog: for a while who ran a studio.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, the martial arts expert. The
dialog: north-south guy. Here in San
dialog: Francisco?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Actually, Miami.
text: He looks straight ahead, trying to act unfazed. But, he's
text: very phased -- his expression is covered in it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Was that before Atlantic City, or
dialog: after?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic
dialog: City was recent. I didn't care for
text: Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers
dialog: and lounge singers.
text: He keeps driving.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: Charlie walks through the precinct towards Tony's office,
text: holding the National Enquirer in his hand.
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: Hey Charlie!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Is Tony back there?
text: The Sergeant nods and Charlie heads back to the office.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: O.K., Tony. Do you have the K673
dialog: form completed yet, that street vendor
dialog: incident on Powell Street?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (really bummed)
dialog: Yes, Captain.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Tony, do you mind my saying that you
dialog: seem a little down?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Captain. It's about my work. About
dialog: being a policeman.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Tony, if there's anything wrong, I'm
dialog: here to listen.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I know. And that's what's irritating,
dialog: you're too nice.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Too nice!?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes, You're my captain for gods sakes.
dialog: You should be constantly on my case,
text: like the captain on Starsky and Hutch.
dialog: Once a week you should routinely
dialog: haul my ass into your office, accuse
dialog: me of being a maverick and complain
dialog: to me that you're sick and tired of
dialog: defending my screwball antics to the
dialog: commissioner.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Well, as you may know, Tony. I don't
dialog: report to a commissioner. I report
text: to a committee, some of whom are
dialog: appointed, some elected and the
dialog: remainder co-opted on a bi-annual
dialog: basis. A quorum --
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Police work should be all about
text: running around, following up crazy
dialog: hunches that turn out to be right,
text: going out on a limb.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Well Tony, I've never seen it that
dialog: way. For me police work is all about
dialog: following procedure and remaining
dialog: accountable to the general public.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Captain! When I joined the police
dialog: force, I thought I was going to be
dialog: Serpico and unfortunately I ended up
dialog: being Toma. I would have settled for
dialog: Beretta.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: That's interesting Tony. I'm perturbed
dialog: that you should be so disillusioned.
text: Charlie enters.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, Tony, I gotta talk to you.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Oh, hello, Charlie. Look, I'm in the
dialog: way here. You guys probably have
dialog: something you want to talk about,
dialog: and Tony, if you've still got stuff
dialog: you want to sort out, please, you
dialog: know where the suggestion box is.
text: The Captain exits.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nice guy. Hey, what's up?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm having doubts about being a cop
dialog: again. It's not like how it is on
dialog: cop shows. All I do is fill out papers
dialog: and reports.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Let me get this straight, your Captain
dialog: hasn't threatened to have you up on
dialog: charges so fast you won't know what
dialog: hit you?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No! He's never once said to me that
dialog: he was going to "throw the book at
dialog: me so hard it'll knock my ass from
dialog: here till Tuesday." Anyways what's
dialog: up?
text: Charlie pulls out the National Enquirer (the one on MRS. X,
dialog: the Honeymoon Killer).
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Have you heard of this case? Mrs. X?
text: She murders her husbands on their
text: honeymoons and then changes her
text: identity and marries again.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I never heard of it. So what?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Curious, that's all. I read about
dialog: it, and...
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: I think I'm dating Mrs. X.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Two words, Charlie. Get therapy.
dialog: They have doctors that deal
dialog: specifically with this illness.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Everything's adding up, Tony. One of
dialog: the victims was a martial arts expert.
dialog: Last night at dinner, she put a
dialog: martial arts move on my dad.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: There about twenty thousand people
dialog: in San Francisco who are martial
dialog: arts experts. Should I arrest all of
dialog: them too?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If they also say Ralph in their sleep
dialog: I think it'd be a good start.
dialog: (showing him paper)
dialog: Ralph Elliot. A plumber from San
dialog: Francisco. Missing since his
dialog: honeymoon.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You're just getting scared. Like the
dialog: dream, you feel Harriet could be the
dialog: one, so you start to suspect her of
dialog: things, 'cause deep down you're scared
dialog: that if she is the one, you'll marry,
dialog: and marriage to you is death.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, don't analyze my dreams, okay?
dialog: They're my dreams. Analyze your own
dialog: dreams.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: It's not a marrying thing, Tony.
dialog: It's a murdering thing.
dialog: (showing him paper)
dialog: Harriet lived in Atlantic City, right?
dialog: Well so did this guy, right around
dialog: the same time she left town.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (reading article)
dialog: "Larry Leonard, a crooner who made a
dialog: name for himself for being able to
dialog: sing in six different languages the
dialog: song "Only You".
dialog: (putting paper down)
dialog: Does she know the song "Only You?"
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't know. It hasn't come up yet.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Charlie, move past it. You're running
dialog: your life by the National Enquirer.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: What? It's the fifth highest
dialog: circulating newspaper in the United
dialog: States.
dialog: (taking paper back)
dialog: Mrs. X. Please. Look it up.
scene_heading: COMPUTER ROOM AT POLICE STATION - MINUTES LATER
text: Charlie and Tony are in the back with KATHY, a stocky black
text: woman in uniform, who works in the files department.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: There's no record of any deaths. All
dialog: three of these guys were reported
dialog: missing around the time of their
dialog: honeymoon, but so were the wives. No
dialog: pictures of any of the brides. For
dialog: all we know they just picked up and
dialog: moved away.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And Ralph Elliot, too?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Charlie, you're talking about three
dialog: guys over a seven year span. That's
dialog: hardly news. No deaths. Elopement in
dialog: this state, as of this day, is still
dialog: not illegal.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (re: the article)
dialog: Yeah well murder is. And this article
dialog: says that these men were murdered by
dialog: the same woman.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Mr. MacKenzie, we've found that,
dialog: most National Enquirer articles are
dialog: actually based on our own police
dialog: reports. They take the facts and
text: fabricate a story around them.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It's true, Charlie. You gotta realize
dialog: that. I mean, personally, I would
dialog: lie to you, but Kathy... has this
dialog: crazy notion of always telling the
dialog: truth.
dialog: (patting his back)
dialog: You feel better now?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It guess so. It's just... if I had a
dialog: photo of Harriet, I could show it to
dialog: the relatives or friends of Mrs. X's
dialog: victims to identify her.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Charlie, listen to me! There is no
dialog: Mrs. X! Drop it! Okay?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - HARRIET'S APARTMENT - EVENING

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: You're back. But Harriet's not here

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Maybe I could wait.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Sure. That would be fine.
text: She then starts to slowly close the door. He props it open
text: with his hand.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Inside? I was hoping...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (letting him in)
dialog: I'm glad you asked. I didn't want to
dialog: be so forward. I mean, if you're
dialog: waiting inside, then you feel
dialog: obligated to entertain me and keep
dialog: up the conversation just to be polite,
dialog: and really your head might be totally
dialog: elsewhere and then there's the chance
dialog: that you would really want to talk
dialog: and it's me who'd be busy, but in an
dialog: attempt not to be rude, I sit there
dialog: and listen to some story that you
dialog: don't really want to tell and I don't
dialog: really have time to hear. You know?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I couldn't agree with you more.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I think about a lot of things.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look, if you have work to do, you go
text: right ahead.
dialog: ("ah, here's an angle")
dialog: I mean, to tell you the truth, I'd
dialog: love to see your work.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Okay! What would you like me to do?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, I don't want to see you work. I
dialog: was talking about your work. Your
dialog: photographs. That one that I saw was
dialog: so, wonderful, and...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Harriet's far more talented than I
dialog: am.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, I'm sure it's so subjective
dialog: anyway and...
dialog: (out of patience)
dialog: Rose, show me your photos.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPHS
dialog: There are two kinds. Beautiful travel pictures and very erotic
text: black and white portraits of young men and women. All with a
text: slight sadomasochistic quality. At the bottom of every photo
dialog: is says: "Seasons Greetings".
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, these are some interesting photos
dialog: here. Very impressive. Nice shots of
dialog: Sauselito and... some good bondage
dialog: shots. A lot of people wouldn't think
dialog: to mix the two subjects, but they're
dialog: really a natural together.
dialog: (new thought)
dialog: Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any
dialog: pictures of Harriet by chance, would
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (re: her cards)
dialog: Well, I don't think she'd wanna do
dialog: this sort of...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, no, not that. Just, in general
dialog: some photos. Any little snapshot
dialog: would do.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I doubt I'd have any. Harriet hates
text: being photographed.
text: The sound of a key in the door as Harriet enters the

speaker_heading: HARRIET (O.S.)

dialog: What are you guys doing?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (covering up)
dialog: Oh, nothing. Just looking through
dialog: some of Rose's work.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: ...Charlie wanted a photo of you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And that. That too.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Why of me, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, sentimental reasons. Something
dialog: to remind me of you when we're not
dialog: together.
text: She takes him in her arms and gives him a knee buckling kiss.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: There, can you remember that?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay, it's just, I was gonna give

dialog: You won't try it. I spent twenty
dialog: minutes making it.
text: He takes it. Lifts it to his mouth... then puts it on the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (sniffing it)
dialog: Ummm. Smells good. Maybe I'll take
dialog: some to the office tomorrow.
dialog: (running into bathroom)
dialog: I'm gonna brush my teeth. Be right
dialog: back.
text: Charlie goes into the bathroom.
scene_heading: CHARLIE'S BATHROOM
text: Harriet comes into the bathroom and lays the empty glass
text: down on the counter.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I'm gonna take a quick shower.
text: Charlie notices the empty glass on the counter.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Harriet, where did the shake go?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: What do you care? I drank it.
dialog: (getting into shower)
dialog: You could have at least tried it.
dialog: You make me feel bad sometimes,
dialog: Charlie. I don't know why.
text: With her in the shower, he sneaks back into the bedroom and
text: checks the trash can. Nothing. Then he runs around the bed
text: to the other trash can. Nothing.
text: He looks thoroughly confused as she enter the bedroom, wearing
text: a towel. She takes the towel off as she slips underneath the
text: covers. He gets into bed next to her. She gives him a kiss.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Sorry. I'm a little sensitive. You
dialog: didn't want to drink my milkshake.
dialog: So what -- right?
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHORMAN
speaker_heading: (ON TV)
dialog: Regarding the murder between the two
dialog: partners, we talked to Toxicologist

speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHORMAN
speaker_heading: (ON TV)
dialog: Doctor, is it possible that one could
dialog: be poisoned with no trace at all?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR SHOW
speaker_heading: (ON TV)
dialog: Certainly. There are plants that
dialog: grow very commonly in our own backyard
dialog: that could easily be fermented into
dialog: poison. Take for instance the...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (getting nervous;
dialog: blocking out TV)
dialog: Harriet, why don't we shut the light
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHORMAN
speaker_heading: (ON TV)
dialog: Really? And how easy it that to do?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
speaker_heading: (ON TV)
dialog: Scarily enough, quite simple. You
dialog: merely take the...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (blocking out the TV
dialog: again)
dialog: Maybe we should turn the light back
dialog: on. Yeah that's better.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Charlie, what's the matter?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Charlie...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, it's just...
dialog: (re: the TV)
dialog: The TV. You can't even watch the
dialog: news these days without getting
dialog: depressed.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I know, Charlie. And it's not just
dialog: that. Look at the things people are
dialog: doing. Partners killing each other...
dialog: I mean, you hear a story like that,
dialog: and... who can you really trust these
dialog: days?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: It's like, have you ever stood with
text: someone at the edge of a cliff, or
text: the edge of a subway platform, and
dialog: you think, just for a split second,
dialog: "What if I pushed him?"
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, I don't really take the subway
dialog: ever, so...
text: Charlie turns over on his side, she cuddles up behind him.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I'm just making a point of how many
dialog: times we trust people with our lives.
dialog: I mean, look at us. If you didn't
dialog: trust me, you would never be able to
text: fall asleep.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Look at you, you're sleeping. Look
dialog: how vulnerable you are. I mean, I
dialog: could do anything at that point.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: What could you do?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (sweet and innocent)
dialog: Anything. You're lying on your side,
dialog: asleep, I could... stick a needle in
dialog: your ear.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: (grabbing his ear at
dialog: the thought)
dialog: Aahhh!
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I'm just making a point of what a
dialog: good relationship we have. Goodnight,
dialog: sweetheart.
text: He looks very uneasy. She kisses him and shuts off the light.
text: The moon gives the room an eerie glow.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Well, good night.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Good night.
text: She doesn't close her eyes. He's scared to close his. Pause.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well... good night.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Good night.
text: They both look over at each other. She closes her eyes. He
text: takes a deep breath and then closes his eyes.
text: And covers his ear with his hand.
scene_heading: INT. BART PLATFORM - DAY
text: Charlie is on the crowded platform. Next to him is an old
text: lady with a lot of shopping bags. Three kids on skateboards
text: whiz by and accidentally knock bags out of her hands. Cat
text: toys and cans of cat food go everywhere. Charlie bends down
text: and starts to help her gather her stuff.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Thank you very much, young man. I've
dialog: gotta get all this stuff back to my
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Your children?
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: When I say my children I mean my
dialog: cats. You see my children moved out
dialog: years ago, so all I've got is my
dialog: cats. I have over one hundred of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's a lot of cats.
speaker_heading: HARRIET (O.S.)
dialog: Charlie.
text: Charlie looks up and sees Harriet waving to him from the
text: subway stairs. He waves back and motions. "I'll be there in
text: a second", and continues to help the old lady. She watches
text: from the stairs.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: You see this red toy? That's for the
dialog: Captain, he's finicky. and this blue
dialog: one? That's for Marco Polo.
text: Two train headlights are seen off in the distance.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Do you have a name for all of your
dialog: cats?
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Oh, yes.
text: Charlie glances over at Harriet, who slowly makes her way
text: down the platform towards him.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Let me see! There's Winston Churchill,
dialog: Reda Sovine, Thomas Edison, Andrew
dialog: Carnegie...
text: The train is getting closer and closer, and so is Harriet.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: ...He was Scottish.
text: Harriet moves forward a step, Charlie moves back a step.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Wasn't he Irish?
text: As Harriet seems to get closer Charlie continues to back up,
text: picking up cat toys. Charlie realizes he has no where else
text: to turn. so he side steps down the platform, never stopping
text: his conversation with the lady.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Actually he was Scottish. Trust me,
dialog: I know these things.
text: Harriet is moving in on him. Charlie steadily makes his way
text: down the platform, feigning accidentally kicking cat food
text: down the platform. The old lady is unsure what is going on,
text: she tries to keep up with him.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Now that you say it, he was Scotch.
text: Charlie runs out of platform. Harriet is very close to him.
text: The train is closer, so is Harriet. Charlie lets out a scream.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Noooooo!
text: Charlie is standing at the edge of the platform, Harriet is
text: a good six or seven feet away as the train passes by. Charlie
text: is safe. People are all staring at Charlie curiously,
text: including Harriet and the old lady. Charlie is embarrassed.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Nooooooo, Scotch is a drink. Scots
dialog: are a people. Sorry, that just always
dialog: bugged me.
dialog: No one knows what is going on.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: I'm sorry, I didn't know it meant so
dialog: much to you.

scene_heading: OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Did they mention anything about his

scene_heading: OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1
dialog: (crest fallen)

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

scene_heading: OBITUARY ASSISTANT #1

speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Why not? And tell me the truth.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The truth. Okay. The truth is...
text: She is so close to him, and so very beautiful, it's
text: distracting.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The truth is... I'm afraid that you
dialog: are...
dialog: (he can't)
dialog: You're going to laugh.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay... the truth is that I'm afraid
dialog: you're going to ki... leave me.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I'm going to "cleave you?" What does
dialog: that mean?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Leave me. Not "cleave me." Reject
dialog: me. And so I decided to take matters
dialog: into my own hands and get it over
dialog: with by...
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Rejecting me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (he feels awful)
dialog: Purely preventive... It's not anything
dialog: you've done.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I know that... So why are you leaving
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (heartbroken)
dialog: Harriet, maybe I'm not meant to be

text: A single tear runs down her cheek. She brushes it away
dialog: quickly.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I never wanted to hurt you.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: You haven't. At least you left early
dialog: on.

scene_heading: INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

dialog: minutes later you show up.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Sorry. I know it was irresponsible
dialog: to stay at the drug bust until it
dialog: was over, but... What happened?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (slowly sitting up)
dialog: I'm gonna tell you, but when I do,
dialog: just say nothing. Don't judge me.

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Fine. Okay.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm sorry, I just... why?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tony, she's a killer. The...
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: But nothing's proven. The only thing
dialog: you're actually sure she did so far
dialog: is she's treated you like a King.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I dunno, Tony, I just...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Besides, everyone has something going
dialog: on with them. I mean, you can't find
dialog: everything in one person. I mean,
dialog: she's bright, she's funny, she's

speaker_heading: SHERRI

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HARRIET

dialog: there, some of you weren't born yet,
dialog: some of you are now dead, but... We
dialog: both said, "I do" and we haven't
dialog: agreed on a single thing since. But,
dialog: I'm glad I married you May cause...
dialog: It could have been worse and
dialog: besides... I still love you.
text: They kiss and everyone APPLAUDS. Uncle Angus breaks into,
text: "Stand By Your Man." May and Stuart start to dance. Charlie
text: looks at another young couple who are touched by this sincere
text: display of love. He looks over at Harriet. Stuart and May
text: feed each other cake. Charlie approaches Harriet.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Harriet, I wanna talk to you.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Boy, you really made some impression
dialog: with Ralph. She can't get over you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (stalling; nervous)
dialog: I'm just so happy for you to have
dialog: friends like Ralph. What a great
dialog: friend to have.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Is everything all right, Charlie?
dialog: You're perspiring.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I want to have a wedding. With you.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I don't know, Charlie. It's so good
dialog: like it is. Why don't we just live
dialog: together first?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Because, I love you and I want you
dialog: to marry me and be with me for 45
dialog: years. I want you to have my children,
dialog: and I want to have your children. I
dialog: know that sounds like a lot of
dialog: children, and they might not all get
dialog: along, but... I'm finally ready to
dialog: trust you and to make a commitment.
dialog: Marry me, Harriet, please. Be my
dialog: wife.
text: Harriet flinches slightly at the word "Wife", but Charlie is
text: too wrapped up in the moment to notice. Stuart addresses the
dialog: group.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I'd like to thank Charlie for throwing
dialog: us this party. I hope some day you
dialog: have the same great 45 years that
dialog: we've had.
text: People clap and smile. Harriet looks at Charlie. He has tears
text: in his eyes.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Yes.
text: At first it doesn't register. Then...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You will?
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Let's get married, Charlie.
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: (from across room)
dialog: Harriet, come here a minute. I want
dialog: you and Uncle Angus to play a song
dialog: together.
text: Harriet and Charlie kiss one last time and she goes to the
dialog: piano.
text: Charlie stays in the corner, and Tony comes over.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Hey, sorry I'm so late. What's
dialog: happening?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nothing. Nothing at all. Just two
dialog: little things...
dialog: (as Tony looks in)
dialog: That woman over there in the corner...
dialog: She's Harriet's friend, and her name
dialog: is Ralph.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No shit.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And secondly... That woman over
dialog: there...
dialog: (Re: Harriet)
dialog: That's Harriet, and we're getting
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Fantastic... What did I tell you.
dialog: She's a great girl. And the last
dialog: thing in the world she'd be is a
dialog: murderer.
text: And then Harriet begins singing at the piano.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (singing)
dialog: ONLY YOU...
text: CAN MAKE THIS WORLD SEEM RIGHT...
dialog: ONLY YOU...
text: CAN MAKE THIS DARKNESS LIGHT..."
text: Tony and Charlie look at each other. "Only you?" Then Charlie
text: looks at his bride with confidence.
text: He walks over and joins her. She sings to him. It's a moment.
scene_heading: INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
text: Charlie and Harriet pick out a diamond ring.
scene_heading: INT. TRAVEL AGENCY

scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE
text: They are getting their blood tests back. Harriet looks at

text: does a victory dance.
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTTISH PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - ESTABLISHING
scene_heading: INT. SCOTTISH PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH
text: Charlie and Harriet are being married. Harriet is in a
text: beautiful wedding gown. Charlie is wearing a kilt. Tony is
text: the best man. He also wears a kilt. Stuart, also kilted,
text: May, the whole family along with a hundred well-wishers are
text: in attendance. The SCOTTISH MINISTER presides. Rose is in a
dialog: kilt.
scene_heading: SCOTTISH MINISTER
dialog: Now, Mr. MacKenzie, if you will take
dialog: this woman to be your wife, through
dialog: thick and thin, for better or for
dialog: worse, please say: "I do"...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I do...
scene_heading: SCOTTISH MINISTER
dialog: Now Harriet, if you will take this
dialog: man, through good times and bad, for
dialog: ever and ever, as your husband, please
dialog: say "I Do"...
text: Harriet starts to speak; but right before the words come
text: out, she stares into Charlie's eyes and STOPS. Charlie looks
text: nervous. So does the Scottish Minister. So does Tony. So
dialog: does everyone.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (after a long pause;
dialog: finally:)
dialog: I do.
scene_heading: SCOTTISH MINISTER
dialog: Now Charlie... Kiss the beautiful
dialog: bride!
text: Charlie and Harriet kiss. We can see (though Charlie can't)
text: Harriet has a strange unsure expression on her face. Tony
text: notices it though and can't figure it out.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Let's get pissed.
text: The wedding march kicks in being played by a drunken Scotsman
speaker_heading: on BAGPIPES.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION HALL
text: A Scottish accordionist and a Drummer play SCOTLAND THE BRAVE.

speaker_heading: THE BRAVE.
text: We pass the buffet which we see is catered by "Meats Of The
text: World." Then we pass a very drunken Stuart in a heated
text: discussion with four other people.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: You know Golden Gate park was designed
text: by a Scotsman, MacClaren, which is
dialog: who MacClaren park was named after.
text: The others agree heartily.
text: May and Tony are dancing. May is dancing uncomfortably close.
text: She keeps sliding her hand down to his ass, which he then
text: has to move back to his shoulder.
text: Then we come to William, who's reluctantly at the children's
text: table. All his little cousins are queuing up for a chance to
text: feel his head.
text: We find Charlie in a corner. One of the hooting Scottish
text: aunties is trying to get him to have another Scotch.
speaker_heading: AUNTIE MOLLY
dialog: (proffering the Scotch)
dialog: Charlie, get this down your neck.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Auntie Molly if I have another one
dialog: I'll end up underneath the table
text: with my kilt over my head.
text: Tony joins them.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Where's Harriet?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't know. Oh, there she is.
text: She's in the corner by herself looking weird and ominous.
text: She has enough food in front or her for three people.
text: She eats ravenously and incessantly. Charlie goes over to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: A little hungry, were you?
text: At that moment, a FLASH goes off. Harriet looks up angrily.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: What are you...!
text: Then she realizes it's Rose. She calms down and smiles.
text: Charlie looks at her, a little peculiarly, but Harriet regains
text: her composure.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Sorry. The flash just...
text: The band kicks into a new dance. A YOUNG BOY comes up to the
text: bagpipe man with a shot of whiskey and whispers into his
text: ear. The bagpipe man stops the song, downs the whiskey and
text: then breaks into Rod Stewart's "IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY." From
text: across the room we hear Stuart singing.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: (full volume; singing)
dialog: IF YOU THINK I'M SEXY...
dialog: AND YOU WANT MY BODY...
text: COME ON BABY LET ME KNOW.
text: Stuart gives the Bagpiper the thumbs up. The young people in
text: the room start to jam, and then one by one the other guests
text: start getting into the swing of things. The bagpipe man
text: continues playing. It is clear that he is far too drunk to
text: play. He slowly keels over, drunk. And as he falls over face
text: first, he lands on his Bagpipes. The bagpipes let out an
text: ATONAL DEFLATING SOUND like the last dying throes of a
text: tortured animal. The BAGPIPE WAIL extends into the next scene.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I wish you could be me, so you could

speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: It sounds wonderful
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Do you think that would be a good
dialog: line for a poem?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Honestly? It sounds a little Hallmark.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, it's a little Seals and Croft.
dialog: I have a habit of sabotaging

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Captain, I know what I'm doing. Trust

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I knew she would! I knew it!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Yeah, apparently she also confessed

dialog: Spiletti!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Oh, my god! I gotta go!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Yeah, screw this one up Spiletti and

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Lamb chops, creamed spinach, stuffed

scene_heading: EXT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - EARLY EVENING
text: They are still driving along the coast. Charlie is eating

text: now, her movements a little static. She keeps looking behind
text: them and out the window.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What do you keep looking behind us
dialog: for?
dialog: (joking)
dialog: Is someone following you, or...?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: They were. I think they're gone.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (curious; pausing)
dialog: What do you mean, they were?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: The gas station guy. I thought he
dialog: was chasing us for a while, but I
dialog: guess he stopped.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The gas station guy? Why would the
dialog: gas station guy chase us.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I don't know, Charlie. I guess for
dialog: not paying.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What do you mean not paying? You
dialog: didn't pay him for the gas.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I forgot to pay... I didn't want to

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So, you just left.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Yes. And you're an accomplice.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Look, Rose. I need a photo.
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: The picture didn't come out.
dialog: (he waits)
dialog: It was unflattering. In made her
text: look ten pounds heavier.
dialog: (he waits)
dialog: She's my sister.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: She's been implicated in a crime. I
dialog: need the photo to eliminate her as a
dialog: suspect.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: And if she's not innocent. If she's,

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: If she's "quirky" we'll save Charlie's

dialog: back seat and...
text: As they deal with the luggage, Harriet starts to walk away
text: from the hotel, away from the car, rain falling on her head.
text: She walks straight at the CAMERA, so only we can see her

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY OF DRY CREEK LODGE - EVENING

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Did you hear that, Harriet? A storm.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
dialog: Ah, nothing. Here's your key. You're

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't you agree, Harriet? Harriet?

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (wiping her tears)

speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: It's nothing. It's just... I was

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So do I. Look, there's nothing more

speaker_heading: HARRIET

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What then?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: You're gonna laugh.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tell me. Of course I'm not gonna
dialog: laugh. Kids is a big thing. It's
dialog: hard. I'm sure I have the same fears.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: If we have kids, Charlie, things
dialog: happen. Kids are healthy and fine,
dialog: and some aren't, and I don't know if
dialog: I could live with myself if I gave
text: birth to a child with webbed feet.
text: Charlie stops to think about this. Webbed feet?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Webbed feet?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: You're laughing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, I'm not laughing.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: You think that's silly?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, no. That's a natural fear. I've
dialog: thought about that fear.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: It really worries me, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (quite confused)
dialog: Well, look, they have, doctors -- I

text: The CONCIERGE at this point interrupts to bring Charlie a
text: TELEPHONE. Everyone stops and watches and waits.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: I'm sorry to interrupt, Sir. There's
dialog: a phone call for you from town.
dialog: (Charlie takes phone)
dialog: They say it's quite urgent.
text: The toast, as well as the entire room, stops -- almost like
text: an E.F. Hutton commercial, waiting for Charlie's phone call
dialog: to finish.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (curious)
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT IN OREGON - EARLY EVENING
text: Tony speaks into the phone frantically.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Charlie, you okay?
scene_heading: INTERCUT PHONE CALL
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Great. Couldn't be better.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Charlie, listen to me! It's her!
dialog: Harriet is Mrs. X! She killed Ralph
dialog: and the two other men!
text: Charlie looks up across the table at Harriet who is completely
text: caught up in the event of seeing how long she can keep her
text: hand in the candle before it hurts.
text: She puts it in, smiles then takes it out. She shakes her
text: hand, and repeats the process.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (talking softly)
dialog: Look, that's great -- it just so
dialog: happens though, that I met...
dialog: (louder than he had
dialog: hoped)
dialog: Ralph, and much to my delight, not
text: only is she alive, but she's female.
dialog: I thought I told you.
text: Harriet looks at Charlie, very suspiciously. He looks back
text: at her, and tries to smile, pretending that he is having a
text: pleasant, and completely irrelevant conversation.
speaker_heading: TONY
text: Rose had a picture. It checked out.
dialog: It's her, Charlie. She is the
dialog: murderer.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Charlie, your food is getting cold.
text: Charlie waves "One Minute" to Harriet, as she watches.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So, what do I do?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I called the police. All the roads
text: are closed, but they're on their
dialog: way. In the mean time just...
text: The line goes DEAD.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (pressing receiver)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: What's a matter, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to concierge)
text: The phone just went dead. I was on
text: the phone and it went dead.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: That's quite common, sir. I'm sure
dialog: the lines'll be out in the whole
dialog: city 'til tomorrow. Enjoy your meal,
dialog: Sir.
text: The Concierge takes the phone away. Charlie turns slowly to
text: Harriet, genuinely scared.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: What happened, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nothing... Nothing happened. Just
text: the lines are down. Phone lines.
text: Suddenly, the band leader continues with his toast.
speaker_heading: BAND LEADER
dialog: (over microphone)
dialog: ...so to these two young people, we
dialog: wish them a long and happy life
dialog: together and would like to play their
dialog: song. The Platters -- "Only You".
text: The band starts to play "Only You".
text: People APPLAUD. Harriet and Charlie just stare at each other.
dialog: He knows.
text: The older couple at the next table, MR. &amp; MRS. LEVENSTEIN,
text: lean over to their table.
scene_heading: MR. LEVENSTEIN
dialog: How about the traditional Bride &amp;
dialog: Groom dance?
text: Another couple walks by and pulls them literally out of the
text: their seats and onto the dance floor.
speaker_heading: OTHER COUPLE
dialog: Come on. It's a tradition.
text: Charlie finds himself in the middle of the dance floor dancing
text: slowly with Harriet. He's scared out of his mind. The music
text: plays in the background. Harriet smiles strangely at him. He
text: tries to smile back, checking all the Exits, planning an
dialog: escape.
text: Then suddenly, call it luckily, MR. LEVENSTEIN, interrupts:
scene_heading: MR. LEVENSTEIN
dialog: Excuse me. Could I cut in on your
dialog: dance?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Of course. Sure...
text: Charlie gives her hand away to Mr. Levenstein. He takes Mrs.
text: Levenstein's hand and starts to dance towards the EXIT, when
text: suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT. The MUSIC is out. The
text: LIGHTS ARE OUT.
text: In the dimmest of lights provided from the cloud covered
text: moon outside, Charlie runs across the dance floor, fighting
text: for an exit to the outside.
text: He arrives in someone's arms on his way.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I need your help! You have to help
dialog: me! I've married a...!
text: The LIGHTS GO BACK ON and Charlie is in HARRIET'S ARMS again.
text: Her face is near menacing now. She smiles a very disturbed
text: grin. He doesn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (much too pleasant)
dialog: Hello, Charlie.
text: Charlie and her are squared off. Neither speak. Suddenly
text: both of them are lifted into the air. They look down and see
text: the waiters and busboys picking them up onto chairs, throwing
text: them up in the air again and again. The MUSIC plays along
text: loudly.
text: Harriet watches Charlie very closely, as Charlie looks scared.
text: Then, the people start to carry them out of the room and
text: down the hallway.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Let's take 'em to their room.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: Yeah, I'm sure they've had enough of
dialog: these crowds for one night.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: My dinner. I didn't finish my dinner
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Smile, Charlie. Act like you're having
dialog: a good time.
scene_heading: INT. OREGON AIRPORT - SAME/NIGHT
text: Tony is talking to an attractive young girl behind the airport
dialog: Rent-A-Car booth.
scene_heading: RENT-A-CAR GIRL
dialog: I'm sorry, Sir. The roads are all
dialog: closed. We can't rent any cars this
dialog: evening.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You have to rent me something. I've
dialog: gotta get up there. My friend's in
dialog: danger...
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE &amp; HARRIET'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: The other hotel guests threw them inside. The room is all
text: made up, the sheets are pulled down, the firewood is cut,
text: the AXE is in the wood.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: Have a good night, you two.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on in. Stay for a nightcap.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: No, you two wanna be alone. See you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (demanding)
dialog: Stay for a nightcap!
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Sir, I really don't think I should
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (shouting)
text: STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP!
text: The bellboy is frightened and runs away.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (shouting down the
dialog: hall after him)
text: STAY FOR A NIGHTCAP!
text: Harriet pulls Charlie back into the room, frightened that
text: he's leaving.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Don't go, Charlie.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: Tony runs out of the airport terminal where he sees a man in
text: his forties who's just entered his four wheel drive jeep.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (flashing his badge)
dialog: Excuse me, Sir, I'm with the San
dialog: Francisco Police Department. I'm on
dialog: official business and I'm afraid I
dialog: have to commandeer your vehicle.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (unfazed)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What do you mean no?!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I happen to know for a fact that you
dialog: don't have the power to commandeer
dialog: my vehicle.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: This is true.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Please can I commandeer your vehicle?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Well, where are you going?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: To The Dry Creek Lodge.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'll give you a lift.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Well, I don't want a lift, I really
dialog: want to commandeer the vehicle. Please
dialog: just let me commandeer the vehicle.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Why don't you just let me drive you
dialog: there? Really, I don't mind, it's on
dialog: my way.
dialog: (pause)
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You're not going to bend on the
dialog: commandeering thing are you?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Well, if we get stopped will you at
dialog: least let me say that I commandeered
dialog: the vehicle, but I let you drive?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'm uncomfortable with that.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Please?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: All right.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLES AND HARRIET'S ROOM
text: Charlie &amp; Harriet are all alone. The voices trail off down
text: the hallway until they disappear. Charlie and Harriet stare
text: at each other. Harriet blocks the door. Charlie looks around
text: the room. The Axe. The Corkscrew. The letter opener. The
text: fountain pen. At this point, everything in the room looks
text: like a potential weapon. Harriet takes the axe.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I heard you on the phone before,
dialog: Charlie. There's something I've got
dialog: to tell you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Harriet, I...
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I've been married before.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I already know.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: About my husbands?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes. And I was meaning to have a
dialog: word with you. We could get an
dialog: annulment.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (screams)
dialog: AAAhhhhhhh!
text: Suddenly the power goes off again. They're both in the dark.
text: A scuffle. Charlie has restrained Harriet, throws her in a
text: walk-in closet and locks it. From behind the door, we hear
text: Harriet WAILING. Which continues.
text: Charlie picks up the axe, looks at it, relieved at his lucky
text: escape. He rushes to the door to escape. He opens it and
text: standing there is Rose.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Aaaaah, Rose, I never thought I'd be
dialog: so glad to see you.
text: Rose smiles. Charlie puts down the axe. The lights flicker
text: back on.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (going to the phone)
dialog: Maybe the phones are working again
dialog: by now.
text: He listens for a dial tone. Beside the phone he sees a note.
text: He starts to read is:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: 'Dear, Harriet. I just can't handle
dialog: the commitment. I'm leaving you.'
dialog: Signed, 'Charlie.'
text: And behind him Rose approaches with the axe raised.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What the hell is this? I didn't write
dialog: this?
text: And at that moment he turns to find the AXE BEING FLUNG
text: THROUGH THE AIR AT his head. He ducks just in time.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What the fuck?!
text: She takes another swing and she hits the lamp off the desk
text: and the room is in complete DARKNESS.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Charlie. Why did you marry Harriet?
dialog: I warned you not to marry her, didn't
dialog: I? I warned all of them. But none of
dialog: them listened to me. They all went
dialog: ahead and married her. She's the
dialog: pretty one. Where's Harriet? What
dialog: have you done with my sister, Harriet?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nothing, Rose.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: If you've done something to my sister,
dialog: Harriet, I swear to God I'll kill
dialog: you.
text: We stay in Charlie's hip pocket as he tries to get away from
text: what he can't see. He stays very silent.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (from the closet)
dialog: Where are you, Charlie? What's going
dialog: on?
text: Then Rose strikes a match. She lights a candle and comes
text: toward him. He looks around. The window is open. And Charlie
text: is gone.
scene_heading: INT. COMMANDEERED CAR - NIGHT
text: Tony and the commandeered man drive through the swampy,
text: winding road on the way up to the hotel. Tony is drumming on
dialog: the dash.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Could you stop doing that please?
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE-LIKE ROUND TOWER/LEDGE OF TOWER - NIGHT
text: Charlie tightropes along the ledge of the building. The storm
text: continues. Rose comes out on the ledge and starts to chase
text: him. He rounds the bend. Charlie looks into one room and
text: sees MR. &amp; MRS. LEVENSTEIN there. There's loud OPERA MUSIC
text: playing in the room
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Call the police!
scene_heading: INT. THE LEVENSTEIN'S ROOM - NIGHT SAME
text: The Levensteins prepare for bed. Charlie races by their
text: window. Then Rose races by.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Call the police!
text: Mr. Levenstein closes the curtains. He can't hear.
scene_heading: EXT. LEDGE - NIGHT
text: Charlie races along the slippery ledge, almost falling at
text: several points. Rose then appears on the roof holding the
text: Axe, still.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (mostly to herself;
dialog: slurring most words)
dialog: Charlie, did you like your note? I
dialog: thought it was pretty accurate. I
dialog: did all the husbands' notes. I can
dialog: forge anyone's handwriting, I can
dialog: write in anyone's style. See, I'm an
dialog: artist. Harriet isn't an artist.
dialog: Sure she could get a husband, but
dialog: she could never have done this. And
dialog: you know what I'm most proud of?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What's that, Rose?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Harriet never knew. She thought they
dialog: all just left her. I protected her.
dialog: She's my sister.
text: Charlie turns and runs. Rose chases him.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Tony breaks into the room with his gun drawn.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Charlie!
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: (from closet)
dialog: Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet.
dialog: I'm in here.
text: Carefully, Tony opens the closet door.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
text: Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie.
text: They're out on the ledge.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (not believing)
dialog: Get on the floor and put your hands
dialog: behind your back.
text: Harriet willingly goes on the floor.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Sure, anything. You've got to save
dialog: Charlie.
text: Tony slaps cuffs on her and takes her to the window.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Tony is standing with his back to the window, between it and
text: Harriet. She looks out of the window and screams.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: Look! It's Charlie!
text: From Harriet's POV we see Charlie on the ledge edging along.
text: He stops in horror when he sees Harriet, glances back to the
text: pursuing Rose, and rushes off.
text: Tony looks behind him out the window. Nobody is there.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Nice try.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I swear to you... It was Charlie...
dialog: Look! Now there's Rose!
text: Rose looks into the room, with the axe in her hand.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No you don't.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I beg you... Look! It is Rose.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Oh no, not again.
text: (he glances at the
dialog: window)
dialog: Aaaaah! Rose.
scene_heading: INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW
text: There is opera music playing. Charlie rushes by, past the
text: window. There is a beat and he comes back, staring inside in
dialog: amazement.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Mr. Levenstein is in a Viking outfit. Mrs. Levenstein is in
dialog: full Norse Regalia.
scene_heading: INT. LEVENSTEIN'S WINDOW
text: Charlie gulps and rushes on, hastily pursued by Rose.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROOF
text: Rose pulls the Axe back and swings, and the momentum of the
text: swing pulls her feet out from under her, and on the slippery
text: icy roof she falls and starts to slide.
text: Just as she's about to go off the fifty foot high roof,
text: Charlie climbs down the roof. He stands over her. She's about
text: to slip. Her hands are losing strength. Her fingers are
text: slipping. The rain is falling harder and harder.
text: Charlie walks over to the cage where she's hanging on for
dialog: life.
text: He leans down to help her up, but just as he grabs on to her
text: hand, the drainpipe she's holding onto slips.
text: She is now dangling from the roof, the rain falling harder
text: and harder. Charlie now is nowhere near her. He then gets
text: down on his knees on the roof and starts to climb down the
text: side of the drainpipe to get her.
text: Rose looks up helplessly at him. Not really asking for his
text: help. Not denying it. She's accepted her fate.
text: Policemen, ambulances and spectators have gathered below in
text: bunches as Charlie climbs down the drainpipe, he himself
dialog: hanging on for dear life.
text: He just reaches out far enough to grab her hand, and just as
text: he does, her drainpipe tears and falls into the crowd below.
dialog: Charlie, then with all his strength -- his "where has this
dialog: strength been my whole life" strength -- pulls her up to the
text: roof next to him.
text: Several policemen make their way onto the roof and come over
text: to where Charlie is detaining Rose. The police take her,
text: handcuff her and cart her away. From the corner of the roof
text: appears Tony.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I hate to bother you on your
dialog: honeymoon, Charlie, but...
text: Charlie looks beyond Tony and sees Harriet standing in the
text: doorway. He goes over and puts his arm around Harriet.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thank God. I'm sorry I doubted you,
dialog: but I thought you were the killer,
dialog: but you were acting pretty strange?
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I thought you were going to leave
dialog: me, like the others. Thank God they
dialog: were just murdered. I thought they
dialog: were always leaving me.
text: Below, Rose is put into a police car and taken off. The SIRENS
text: disappear. So do the crowds.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO:
text: THE SOUND OF A CROWD IN A CLUB:
scene_heading: INT. SPILETTI'S COFFEE HOUSE
text: Charlie is on stage looking very beatnik. He's reading his
text: poetry, but we can't hear it. He nods to someone off stage.
text: Harriet is in the audience, also looking very beatnik with
text: their three year old son, STUART, a miniature beatnik version
dialog: of Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (V.O.)
dialog: My dad was right. You don't lose
dialog: your muse once you're married. Nothing
dialog: changed, except I gained a great
dialog: son, Stuart.
text: SOUND UP on Charlie's poetry.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: MARRIED MAN
speaker_heading: MOST MERRY
scene_heading: AND IN CONCLUSION
scene_heading: CROWD AND CHARLIE
text: THIS POEM SUCKS.
text: The crowd goes crazy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thank you very much.
text: HOUSE MUSIC kicks on. It's Saturday Night by the Bay City
dialog: Rollers.
scene_heading: BAY CITY ROLLERS
scene_heading: S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y NIGHT
