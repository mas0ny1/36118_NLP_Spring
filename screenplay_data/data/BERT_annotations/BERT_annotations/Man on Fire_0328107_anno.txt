dialog: "Man On Fire"
scene_heading: OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE
scene_heading: EXT. MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: High over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun
text: pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we
text: descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets:
text: the sounds of a Mass being sung.
scene_heading: A CATHOLIC CHURCH
text: The big wooden doors open to release the parishioners
text: inside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his
text: GIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin.
text: They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a
text: faucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes
text: 500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...
speaker_heading: A GRAND MARQUIS
text: Squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside
text: the Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing badges. In a
text: moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff-
text: arming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend cries and the
text: gossip among the parishioners begins...
text: The Grand Marquis pulls away.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND MARQUIS - DAY
text: They shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat.
dialog: These guys are not the police.
text: A switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the
text: boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels.
text: Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf.
text: Duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODED AREA - DAY
text: The Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW
text: GUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His
text: clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He
text: stands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over
text: from one group to the other.
scene_heading: INT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: The phone rings. A bomb going off. Eighteen's
text: distraught FATHER (family photos of the boy on the wall)
dialog: answers.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 2.
text: REVERSE TO REVEAL a battery of POLICE and NEGOTIATORS in
text: the room with him. One of them listens in, waves fingers
text: at him as the negotiations begin.
scene_heading: INT. VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF AN 8' X 4' CELL - DAY
text: A wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing it, Eighteen
text: stands naked blindfolded and shivering. The back of his
text: leg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a little JACK
text: RUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off his calf.
text: A MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates
text: by cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps
text: his thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear
dialog: scratched.
text: At a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the
text: ground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in
text: tape leaving one ear exposed.
scene_heading: CUT TO T.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA
dialog: newspaper, being interviewed, "...organized crime
dialog: syndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last
dialog: two years."
scene_heading: EXT. UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY
text: As a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A
text: glimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear
text: partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
text: A MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father
text: waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender
dialog: flag.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM)
text: Footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway.
text: Empty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown
text: neighborhood. Looks more like "war torn Beirut", burnt
text: out cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to
text: the waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the
text: footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi-
text: derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of
text: fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. He
text: slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY - TWILIGHT
text: RUSH HOUR. A red stream of headlights separated from a
text: white stream of taillights by a narrow median.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 3.
text: HORNS blare as a CAR stops. Eighteen, still blindfolded,
text: is dumped on the median. The car pulls away.
text: He stands there in the whirlwind. Pathetically SCREAMING
text: for help. More horns, shouts, no help.
text: END MAIN TITLES. Goes to black.
speaker_heading: CREASY'S VOICE
dialog: Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in the
dialog: name of charity and good will shepherds
text: the weak through the valley of darkness
dialog: for he is truly his brother's keeper and
dialog: the finder of lost children.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY
dialog: Samuel Valencia Ramos and his lawyer Jordan Kalfus in the
text: privacy of an alcove table. Jordan is well heeled, well
text: connected and well oiled. In that order. Samuel, at 40,
text: already has the patrician look that has served the male
text: members of his family for generations. They discuss the
text: kidnapping, a headline on the paper Jordan tosses aside.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: The family paid the ransom and he was
dialog: returned two days later.
dialog: (laughs; chews)
text: His father still hasn't gotten up the
dialog: nerve to ask him if they fucked him up
dialog: the ass.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: And now every mother with money in Mexico
dialog: City wants bigger and better bodyguards.
dialog: My own wife included.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: If she pisses you off, you get another one.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: (laughs grimly)
dialog: Do you know what she told me last night?
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
text: Samuel sits at his baby grand piano playing a gentle
dialog: rendering of 'Delibes'. His American wife LISA stands
text: away from him. Just the sight of her back reveals a
text: pitch perfect petulance. She tells him:
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 4.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: A man's worth can be judged by what he
dialog: has or what he owes. Only the amount
dialog: matters.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: And bankruptcy. Where will that put me
dialog: in the social strata?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I'm only asking for one thing. And it's
dialog: not an extravagance. It's not even for
dialog: me; it's for our daughter.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Our daughter.
text: She turns at that: a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts
text: to look at her. She stares, plays him like Chinese
dialog: Checkers.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Our child's safety is at stake.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: (stops playing)
dialog: These people are professionals. They
dialog: don't waste their time taking children
text: whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Samuel, it is not something we should
text: skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the
dialog: car or outside the school was at least
dialog: some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I
dialog: feel totally exposed.
text: She just stares at him. He melts.
speaker_heading: RETURN TO:
scene_heading: INT. AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: Jordan smiles at his client, enjoys seeing him squirm.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be
text: as beautiful as her mother one day.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Yeah? And if she was ugly?
text: Samuel rolls his eyes. Jordan laughs. Beheading two
text: cigars, he passes one to Samuel.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 5.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: All my clients have kidnap and ransom
dialog: insurance.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and
dialog: my family and when it runs out in sixty
dialog: days, without a bodyguard, I will not be
dialog: able to renew it.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: I know you need to please Lisa. An ass
dialog: like that is hard to find. Good
text: bodyguards are even harder.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: I know! I just had to let one go because
dialog: I couldn't afford him!
text: Jordan lights his cigar.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: You need a bodyguard of some description.
dialog: It's a dangerous world we live in. But
dialog: you will get what you pay for. He
dialog: doesn't need to be Superman, does he?
dialog: Can you go fifteen grand?
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: For a year?
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: For a few months. Hire someone cheap.
dialog: You have to have a bodyguard to keep the
dialog: insurance. Then fire him for
dialog: incompetence. The important thing is
text: Lisa's daughter will return to school.
text: Samuel finally follows the logic.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: And Lisa will be able to save face. We
dialog: won't be the only family without a
dialog: bodyguard.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: Her beauty fucks with your mind.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: For an American she understands this
dialog: country very well.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 6.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: She understands men.
text: As Samuel puffs his cigar in satisfaction...
scene_heading: EXT. CORRIDOR - MEXICO CITY AIRPORT - DAY
text: As a 747 is towed by in the background, a MAN strides at
text: us. CREASY. Even in movement, he has a stillness, an
text: air of isolation. He's set apart from other living
dialog: things.
text: He wears dark sunglasses, carries a well-worn leather
text: bag. Inscrutable. Disconnected. A bit frightening.
text: The discipline of a soldier. The independence of a
dialog: gunslinger.
text: Automatic baggage teller (Red Light, Green Light).
text: Creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs
text: card. Light flashes RED.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMS MAN
text: He flips through Creasy's passport. Even the stamps have
dialog: stamps. Thailand. Somalia. Cuba. Columbia. Hong
dialog: Kong. Saudi Arabia. Every country in Europe. Guy's
dialog: been around.
text: Customs looks up from the ink blue American Eagle to the
text: deep matte black of Creasy's sunglasses.
dialog: NOTE: Italics denotes the lines spoken in Spanish.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMS
dialog: Where are you coming from?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: South America.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMS
dialog: Where are you staying in Mexico?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm on to Juarez.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I have a friend there.
text: Customs looks at Creasy a moment. He doesn't look like a
text: man who has 'friends'. Finally, customs smiles.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 7.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMS
dialog: I cannot see your eyes, Senor.
text: Creasy slips off the sunglasses. His eyes are deserted.
text: Inevitable. Customs can only look into them a moment.
text: He indicates for Creasy to put his bags on a conveyor
text: belt leading to an X-ray machine. Creasy lifts his bag
text: onto the conveyor. The official hits the start button.
text: The bag drives forward towards the X-ray machine.
text: Creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMS
dialog: Senor?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia.
dialog: The gun you're about to find in that
dialog: suitcase.
speaker_heading: Polaroid FLASH
text: Shot of Creasy straight on. Shot of Creasy profile.
text: FLASH. Fingers being fingerprinted.
text: JUMPCUTS - suitcase being stripped and ripped (MIDNIGHT
text: EXPRESS), pack of Marlboro, bottle of Jack Daniels,
text: glimpse a weathered Bible (New Testament), intercut with
text: seven pieces of blue steel separated in different parts
dialog: of the bag, ie. toiletries, underwear, lining of
dialog: suitcase.
text: The seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a
text: well travelled Sig Sauer 226. Creasy smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. JUAREZ, MEXICO FOUR BIG BURLY SUV'S - DRIVING
scene_heading: ACROSS THE BORDER CHECKPOINT - DAY
scene_heading: INT. SUV - DAY
text: Six Japanese BUSINESSMEN jabber on cellphones. PAUL

speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: RAYBURN

speaker_heading: CUSTOMS JAIL
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico
dialog: City International. Bring a bunch of
dialog: cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
scene_heading: INT. CUSTOMS AREA - A BACK OFFICE
text: Rayburn has 5K U.S. dollars laid out on the desk between
text: him, the Customs official, and Creasy. The remains of
text: the suitcase are spread around the room. The main
text: offender, the gun being front and center next to the
text: cash. Looks like the official is going to fold.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: This is going to cost you big time.
scene_heading: INT. STRIP BAR - Rethink Location
text: A stripper does a half hearted grind as Rayburn and
text: Creasy sit at the bar sharing a bottle of 'Jack'.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: You got a secondary search and you had a
dialog: gun.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Listen it was a calculated risk. I've
dialog: done it a million times and never got
dialog: caught.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Everything happens once if you live long
dialog: enough.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 9.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags
text: coming off the plane.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: This is Mexico, they do everything
dialog: backwards.
text: Creasy hits the 'Jack'.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: So what's wrong?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Nothing wrong.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Don't give me that bullshit.
text: Creasy changes subject.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: So how's business?
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap
dialog: labor. Factory space. But they feel a
dialog: lot safer living over the border in El
dialog: Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They
dialog: think I'm John-fucking-Wayne.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: But don't you stay in El Paso?
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king
dialog: down here.
text: Creasy takes a look around the Seedy Bar.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Yeah, right...
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Oh, like you haven't been in worse
dialog: places.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: And a level five shithole is better than
dialog: a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
text: Rayburn laughs. Creasy takes the bottle. Creasy's hand
text: is mottled by old burn marks.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 10.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: You been working?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Not for eight months. I was in Columbia
dialog: looking around, but, nothing seemed
dialog: interesting.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: How long you staying, Crease?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just
dialog: wanted to see you, how you were. Came by
dialog: on impulse.
text: Rayburn studies his friend a beat, just seeing the cracks
dialog: that weren't there last time they met.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN

speaker_heading: CREASY

scene_heading: INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
text: Nine-year-old PINTA MARTIN RAMOS stares out at the
text: garden, a bit like Creasy, but only a ten yard stare.
text: Pinta's eyes brim with life. She folds her hands, closes
text: her eyes, prays. 'Chopin' drifts up from downstairs.
text: Samuel on the baby grand.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Dear God. I do not ask for health. Or
dialog: wealth. People ask you so often that you
dialog: can't have any left. Give me God what
dialog: you still have. Give me what no one else
dialog: asks for. Amen.
text: Pinta grabs a battered old TEDDY BEAR and climbs into
text: bed. She pulls the covers up, looks over as her door

text: Lisa enters. Pinta is her daughter.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You should be sleeping, baby.

speaker_heading: PINTA

dialog: When?
speaker_heading: LISA
text: Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard.
dialog: It may take a few days, but you're going
dialog: back.
text: Pinta lets it sink in. Lisa kisses her goodnight.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't
dialog: speak English.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: We'll see. And thank your father in the

dialog: thanked.
scene_heading: EXT. - JUAREZ DESERT - DAWN
text: Four SUV's blast along a desert highway on their way to
text: pick up some Japanese businessmen. Rayburn rides
text: shotgun, Creasy in the back. Rayburn looks like he slept
text: in his clothes. Creasy looks crisp and clean.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: That's right, a bodyguard.
text: Creasy looks at him blankly.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Your Spanish is good enough. You
dialog: certainly look the part.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: You're crazy. People would hire a has-
dialog: been, Ray? A drunk?
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Well, you'd have to keep it under
dialog: control.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 12.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: And what if, just say, there was a kidnap
dialog: attempt?
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: You do your best. They won't be paying
dialog: you enough to perform miracles.
text: Creasy just shakes his head.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at
dialog: half speed you're pretty damn good.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: A bodyguard has to be close to someone
dialog: all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not
dialog: good at that.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: So you'll be the silent type. People
dialog: will appreciate that.
text: Creasy shakes his head, looks out the window.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I came to visit you.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years.
dialog: You don't visit.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in
dialog: Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the
text: toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to
dialog: partner with him. I think he's in
dialog: trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he
dialog: could trust.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air.
dialog: Then decide if you want to... stick

speaker_heading: SAMUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Were you provided with a gun?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Show me, please.
text: Creasy takes his right hand off the wheel, reaches under
text: his jacket and passes back a beat-to-shit looking PISTOL.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: CREASY
text: Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Have you used this type before?
text: Creasy just nods. Doesn't like the show and tell.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Is it loaded?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: It's loaded.
text: Samuel hands back the gun.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 14.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: You will meet my wife first. She would
dialog: like it if you are presentable, polite
dialog: and respectful. You'll be the fifth
dialog: candidate she's seen this week.
text: Samuel flips through a manila folder.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Your resume is impressive. Nine years in
dialog: the Army. Extensive counter terrorism
dialog: work. I shouldn't be able to afford you
dialog: in my current state. What's the catch?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: (honest)
dialog: I drink.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: How does it affect you?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: My coordination. Reaction time. If top
dialog: professionals try to kidnap your
dialog: daughter, the service will be on par with
dialog: the pay.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: And what if amateurs try it?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: No. And no one is to know of your

speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: So are you.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: (introducing)
dialog: My wife, Mr. Creasy.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
text: Lisa steps over, shakes Creasy's hand. Gives him a quick

speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you like a drink?
text: Creasy doesn't hesitate, doesn't look at Samuel and has
dialog: no irony in his answer.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Thank you. Scotch and a little water.
text: She steps to the bar to make it.
scene_heading: CREASY - FROM SOMEONE'S POV
text: Slightly sinister. Watching from the frame of the door.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You've done much of this work before?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Never.
text: Samuel sells, covers for Creasy's reticence.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: He has experience in related work. A
dialog: great deal of it.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
text: Creasy hesitates for an imperceptible beat.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: No. I do not have family.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 16.
text: And then, somehow, Creasy is aware of being watched. His
text: eyes flicker over, just in time to see...
speaker_heading: PINTA
text: Crouched low. In the doorway. She stares back at him a
text: beat, then disappears around the corner.
speaker_heading: SITTING ROOM
text: Creasy frowns. Lisa steps over with Creasy's drink.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Thank you.
text: She makes a point of looking into his eyes. Creasy looks
text: back into hers with complete indifference, something she
dialog: has not experienced even from dying men.
text: She abruptly turns away. Confused for a moment.
dialog: Finally:
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Pinta!
text: A few moments and Pinta arrives. 'Cool Hand Pinta'.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Yes, mom?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: This is Mr. Creasy.
text: Pinta walks over and very formally holds out her hand.
text: Creasy shakes it. An odd beat.
speaker_heading: LISA
text: Pinta, show him to his room.
text: Samuel reacts. Creasy got the job.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: This way, Mr. Creasy.
text: What an actress. As he follows her out. Samuel sits at
text: his baby grand and begins to play.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I think it's nice he's American.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I think it's fantastic.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 17.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You realize that you've brought a killer

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Thank you. I feel better now.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. HOUSE - SUNSET
text: Pinta leads the way. All enthusiasm, away from her

text: Sniffs Creasy's pant leg, unsure.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: If they like me.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Frank doesn't take to most people. Do
dialog: you speak German?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
speaker_heading: PINTA
text: Frank only responds to commands in
dialog: German. He was trained in Frankfurt.
dialog: My Dad loves the idea of having a dog
dialog: around, but hates the fact he lives
dialog: inside.
text: Creasy follows her. Frank pads along after them.
speaker_heading: CREASY'S ROOM
text: Not like downstairs, but comfortable enough.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: We fixed the room up two weeks ago. Mom
dialog: and I. It's nicer than before.

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: You've got a CD player if you like music.
dialog: I like music a lot.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 18.
text: CAW! Creasy looks over at a CAGE on a stand holding a

text: A TV and VHS machine in the corner.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him
dialog: with when he left.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Who's Emilio?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: My last bodyguard. He drove me to school
dialog: in the morning and picked me up in the
dialog: afternoon.
text: Finally Creasy turns, looks at her hard.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm here for you?
text: Pinta smiles huge, nods.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: In between you can take Mom shopping and
dialog: to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr.
dialog: Creasy?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: (big grin)
dialog: Creasy...
text: Frank's tail wags imperceptibly.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Looks like he approves of you.
text: And then, walking on air, she's out the door.
text: Creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that
dialog: comes from years in the military. Front and center he
text: arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and
text: a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a
text: pack of Marlboros and his weathered Zippo. Then, his
text: beaten up gun and holster. A well-travelled New
text: Testament is placed in the drawer.
speaker_heading: CREASY'S BAG
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 19.
text: He reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh
text: bottle of scotch. He breaks the seal, unscrews the cap.
dialog: He pours a double... triple... wait, what do you call a
dialog: full glass of scotch?
text: CAW! The macaw squawks it's disapproval.
text: He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to
text: catch it on the back of his hand. An old game with
dialog: himself.
text: His hand is too shaky. The bullet bounces off, hits the
text: floor. Creasy picks it up. Ejecting the magazine, he
text: starts to oil the weapon.
text: CAW! As the macaw squawks, Creasy looks up. It doesn't
dialog: feel like this relationship is going to work.
scene_heading: INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: A battered TEDDY BEAR watches as Lisa sits on the foot of
text: the bed, tucks Pinta in.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: School tomorrow, baby.
text: Pinta smiles, happy at the thought.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I like him, Mom.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: He's like a great big bear.
dialog: (a secret smile)
dialog: 'Creasy bear'...
text: Lisa smiles, kisses her goodnight. As she starts out...
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: There's something about him.
text: Lisa turns, looks back at her daughter.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I think he's been sick. He's alright
dialog: now, but I think he's been very, very
dialog: sick.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 20.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Well, think about going to sleep. Good
dialog: night, baby.
text: Lisa exits. Pinta looks over at the battered teddy bear.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Just like you, a big old bear.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CREASY
text: In his room. Tests his mag spring with his thumb, begins
text: loading up. The full magazine joins with those already
dialog: loaded.
text: Another glass of scotch is poured.
text: Creasy's hands oil the holster. The Sig Sauer is slipped
text: in. The holster is hung over the corner post of the bed.
text: A map is flattened. Creasy's finger traces various
text: routes, pencils them in. From the house to Pinta's
dialog: school.
text: The macaw squawks again. Creasy steps over, takes the
text: cage and carries it to the open window. He opens the
text: cage door.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Now's your chance.
text: The bird flies, disappears out the window.
scene_heading: INT. LISA &amp; SAMUEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Spent, glistened in sweat, the couple lay side by side.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: She likes him.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Creasy. Pinta likes him.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Pinta loves school. She'd like Count
text: Dracula is he took her back there.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 21.
text: Lisa just smiles, knows her daughter better.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CREASY'S ROOM
text: Creasy's drinking in the dark next to the window,
text: listening to the sounds of Mexico City at night.
text: The empty scotch glass is set down. Ominously sober.
scene_heading: INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: Brushing her hair, Pinta wanders to the window at the
text: sound of a car hood closing. Creasy is down below going
text: over the car; a dark BLUE MERCEDES. As he checks
dialog: underneath...
text: The "Car Wash Guy", Pedro, trying to engage Creasy.
text: Frank looks on, seems like he disapproves of Pedro.
scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES - DAY
text: Creasy sits grimly behind the wheel. Pinta exuberant
text: beside him. Traveling route number one from home base to
text: school. Pinta looks at Creasy's hands on the wheel. The
text: back of the right one is swirled with scars.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Where are you from, Creasy?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: The United States.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I know. But which state?
text: Creasy checks the rearview mirror. A banged up white
text: TOYOTA COROLLA pulls out behind him.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: No state in particular.
text: Pinta frowns; this is going to take some work.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: My mom and me are from Houston, Texas.
dialog: Have you been there?
text: Creasy has his eyes on the mirror.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: No.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 22.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: You can drive and talk at the same time,
dialog: can't you?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: (turns left)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm looking for potential.
text: Creasy checks the mirror. The white Corolla continues
text: the way it was going. False alarm.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Potential? I don't understand.
speaker_heading: CREASY
text: Places where the road bends, places away
dialog: from buildings, places where the traffic
dialog: thins out. But you don't have to
dialog: understand. I do. So no talking.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard
dialog: quit.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Someone gave him more money than we
dialog: could.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm a bargain.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Being black, is that a positive or
dialog: negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Time will tell.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City
dialog: in the last six days. Four a day. What
dialog: do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 23.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my
dialog: fee or get a larger gun.
text: She looks at his scared right hand, then him. All
dialog: curiosity.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT SCHOOL GATES - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: Creasy pulls the Mercedes up out front. He notes the
text: high walls, the heavy gates.
speaker_heading: PINTA
text: Beep the horn.
text: Creasy hits it. A beat and then a shutter opens at eye
text: level. Pinta waves from the car. A moment later the
text: gate is being slowly pushed open by an old WATCHMAN.
text: Creasy drives in toward a rambling, ivy-clad building set
text: in spacious grounds.
speaker_heading: COURTYARD
text: Creasy parks, get out of the car. He looks around,
text: appraising the lay of the land.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Isn't it beautiful?
text: Pinta's name is called. An elderly gray-haired NUN walks
text: over from the entrance. Pinta runs over, kiss her
text: warmly on both cheeks, then leads her toward Creasy.
speaker_heading: PINTA
text: Sister Anna, the headmistress.
dialog: (to nun; proudly)
dialog: This is Creasy, my bodyguard.
text: Sister Anna shakes his hand.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: Mr. Creasy.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: No, Sister, he told me just to call him
dialog: Creasy. He's American. From no state in
dialog: particular.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: You must look after our Pinta. We're so
dialog: happy to have her back in school. Run
text: along now, Pinta.
text: Pinta waves goodbye, bounds away. They watch her go.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 24.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: She's late, Mr. Creasy.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes.
dialog: I -- It won't happen again.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: No offense, but I'm sorry that your
dialog: profession needs to exist.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: So am I, Sister.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: Do you ever see the hand of God in what
dialog: you do?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Not for a long time, sister.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil,
dialog: but overcome evil with good."
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.
text: Sister Anna is impressed. She nods her 'props' to
dialog: Creasy.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm the sheep that got lost.
scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES - CONVENT SCHOOL GATES - DAY
text: Creasy pulls out, starts down the street. He's only gone
text: a hundred meters when SIRENS kick up. A police car
text: behind him. Creasy shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Here we go again.
text: Creasy pulls over, digs around the front seat as TWO
text: SLOPPY COPS head over.
speaker_heading: SLOPPY COP ONE
dialog: Do you speak English, Senor?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Yeah. And Spanish.
speaker_heading: SLOPPY COP ONE
dialog: You have an identification?
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 25.
text: Creasy hands them his PASSPORT and a printed LETTER. A
dialog: legitimate firearms license for bodyguard work witnessed
dialog: by Rayburn.
text: Creasy deliberately puts one hand on the steering wheel,
text: then the other. Minimizing the confrontation.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: It's a temporary license for the gun I'm
dialog: carrying. I just went through all of
text: this at the airport.
scene_heading: INT. BIG BURLY SUV - DRIVING TOWARD THE BORDER - DAY
text: Six Japanese BUSINESSMEN jabber on cellphones. Rayburn's
text: daily routine. He sits up front an Uzi cradled in his
text: lap. As his own cell phone rings, he answers.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Rayburn here. Creasy, what's up?
dialog: (listens; laughs)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: POLICE LINE-UP WALL - As Creasy's MUG SHOT is flashed.
text: CREASY'S HAND - As he's fingerprinted.
speaker_heading: CREASY
text: There's still ink on my fingers from last
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: RAYBURN'S SUV
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: You got tossed. Don't trust the cops,
dialog: especially the Judicials.
dialog: (listens; laughs again)
dialog: Oh you know that?
scene_heading: INT. BAR - DAY
text: Creasy slams a Jack and Coke.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: Creasy striding, the frivolous shoppers like another
text: species as he moves through them. Might as well wear a
text: shark fin. He spots something: a MUSIC STORE.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 26.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC STORE - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: Creasy finds the section he's looking for, searches a
text: rack. There. As he pulls a particular CD, we are not
dialog: privy to what it is.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - PINTA'S SCHOOL - DAY
text: Creasy waits, smoking a Marlboro light, separate from the
text: other drivers and bodyguards. The bodyguards stand
dialog: together sharing cigarettes and stories. Give him a
text: share of unfriendly looks. Creasy could care less.
text: The doors open and the children pour out. PINTA exits, a
text: huge grin as she spots Creasy. Creasy palms the
text: Marlboro. The frown on his might as well be chiseled in
dialog: marble.
scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES - ROLLING -DAY
text: Pinta rides shotgun alongside Creasy. She looks out the
text: window, realizes...
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: We're taking a different way home.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: That's right.
text: Pinta thinks about it, realizes what he's doing, smiles.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I understand. Smart.
text: No answer from Creasy. It's hard not to feel foolish
dialog: around this kid.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Did you like school, Creasy?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Not at all?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: But why not?
text: Creasy's hoping she'll just shut up.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 27.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Hmmm?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: It wasn't a school like yours and there
dialog: was no Sister Anna.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: So you were unhappy?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Being unhappy is a state of mind. I
dialog: never thought about it.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Oh...
text: Pinta watches Creasy a moment, trying to figure a way in.
text: She looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel.
text: Then, as she reaches out...
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: What happened to...
text: And touches it.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: ...your hand?
text: Creasy gives her a look, devoid of humanity for an
dialog: instant.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: No more questions.
text: When he speaks again he's colder; he's decided something.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm not paid to be your friend. I'm paid
dialog: to protect you.
text: They drive on in silence. Creasy finally glances over.
text: Pinta stares straight ahead, her chin quivering.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: And don't start crying.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I'm not crying.
text: But she is. As Creasy stops at a red light...
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 28.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Look, this is the way I am. I don't like
dialog: questions. I --
text: And she's out the door.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Shit.
text: Creasy shoulders open his door, bolts out.
speaker_heading: INTERSECTION
text: Creasy has barely straightened himself and Pinta is
text: already getting back in the car. This time in the
dialog: backseat.
text: Creasy sighs. The light goes green. Scooters whine away
text: and horns blare.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
text: Creasy sits back behind the wheel.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: You can take me home now, Mr. Creasy.
text: Creasy looks back at her, but she stares straight ahead.
text: As the chorus of horns continues, Creasy continues driving.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - DAY
text: Creasy sits at the table with the old gardener GOMEZ
dialog: (we've seen him trimming hedges and such in earlier
text: exteriors). Gomez's just cleaned his plate and is going
text: after any remnants with a crust of bread. Creasy hasn't
dialog: touched his.
text: MARIA, the cook, enters. As she clocks Creasy's plate...
scene_heading: INT. CREASY'S ROOM - SUNSET
text: 'Chopin' drifts across the courtyard. Samuel is a very
dialog: accomplished player.
text: Creasy sits in a chair in the twilight by the window, a
text: glass of scotch in his hand. A knock at the door.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Come in.
text: The door opens. It's Lisa.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 29.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you
dialog: have everything you need.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Is the food alright? Maria tells me that
dialog: you didn't eat.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if
dialog: you have to... Do you mind if I talk to
dialog: you for a moment?
text: He shakes his head. Lisa glides into the room like a
text: dancer, sits down at the foot of the bed.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: How are you getting along with Pinta?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a
dialog: new toy.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yes, she told me. Do you have children,
dialog: Mr. Creasy?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You should know they're tenacious when
dialog: they want something. And Pinta wants to
dialog: be friends.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: You're paying me to protect her, not
dialog: amuse her. Right?
text: A beat and then Lisa nods.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Look. Maybe this isn't going to work.
dialog: Maybe you should ask your husband to hire
dialog: someone... more sociable.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 30.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: No, you're right. You were hired to
dialog: protect her, that's enough. I'm
dialog: confident you'll do that.
text: Lisa stands, is about to start out when she sees his gun
text: and holster hanging from the corner of the bed. It gives
text: her pause. Something sexy about it and Creasy's
dialog: proximity.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I didn't realize you had a gun. I know
dialog: that's silly to say.
text: Creasy doesn't answer, just watches her.
speaker_heading: LISA
text: It makes it all seem so serious.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with
dialog: you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
text: Finally, Lisa just shrugs and disappears out the door.
text: Creasy slugs down a gulp of scotch.
scene_heading: INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Pinta, blankets up, teddy bear beside her, says her
dialog: prayer.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Give me God what you still have. Give me
dialog: what no one else asks for.
text: Then, she listens as Linda Ronstadt's "Blue Bayou" starts
text: to drift through the open window, down from the room
dialog: above.
speaker_heading: RONSTADT
dialog: "I'm going back someday, come what may,
dialog: to Blue Bayou..."
scene_heading: INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: He stands in the dark, in front of the glow of the
text: stereo. The empty bag from the record store. This is
text: the CD he bought. As the song ends, Creasy hits the back-
text: up button. "Blue Bayou" begins again. Creasy takes the
text: 9mm from its holster. As he sits back in his chair...
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 31.
scene_heading: INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Pinta listens to the music, figures a way to dance to it.
scene_heading: INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Creasy sits in the dark with his 'Blue Bayou'. Creasy
text: does not look right. Holding the 9mm, he ejects the
text: round, tries to catch it on the back of his hand. No
dialog: good.
text: He chambers another round. Tries again. Nope.
speaker_heading: LINDA RONSTADT
dialog: Well I'll never be blue, my dreams come
dialog: true, on Blue Bayou...
scene_heading: INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Pinta still dancing, finding a way to be with Creasy
text: whether he knows it or not. Frank, the dog, watches her
text: every move, perplexed.
scene_heading: INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: As the song repeats, Creasy chambers yet another round.
text: Feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into
text: the chamber. Pinta sings along oblivious. Suddenly the
text: barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been
text: pulled. No gun shot. A click. Hammer against shell.
text: Creasy is confused. He ejects the shell and catches it
text: in the palm of his hand. Macro photograph / a small dimple
text: on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his
text: actions. Pinta still dances.
scene_heading: INT. RAYBURN'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 3.A.M.
text: Rayburn in bed with his beautiful 19-year-old Mexican
text: WIFE and their four-year-old SON.
text: As she leans down to kiss her son, a cellphone rings.
text: Rayburn looks over at the nightstand. FIVE CELLPHONES
text: there, one of them ringing. Rayburn finds it.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Rayburn... Creasy! What's wrong?
scene_heading: EXT. RAMOS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Creasy stands at the edge of the drive, the house dark
text: behind him. On his cell phone.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 32.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I said, have you ever had a nine
dialog: millimeter round that just didn't go off?
text: INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING:
text: Rayburn pulling away, sitting on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: You mean a misfire?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I mean nothing. The hammer came down and
text: nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: I've heard of it. Never happened to me
text: though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Maybe...
text: Creasy is troubled about it all to say the least.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: It's like we always used to say: a bullet
dialog: always tells the truth. What were you
dialog: shooting at?
text: Creasy doesn't answer. He holds the bullet up, looks at
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: (focusing; concerned)
dialog: Creasy?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Sorry I woke you, Ray.
text: Creasy clicks off the phone. He starts back toward the
text: house, but stops short again.
text: There she is. Pinta. Standing in the window of her
text: room. She's been watching him. It's like Creasy seeing
text: her for the first time. And she's been watching him
dialog: forever. No easy answer for it. They're connected
dialog: somehow.
scene_heading: INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Fingers putting the special bullet into an old matchbox.
text: It takes it place of honor front and center on the
text: shrine. Next to the Marlboros and scotch. The New

dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 33.
text: CU - Creasy asleep in his bed for the first time.
scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY
text: Silent Creasy driving. Lisa and Pinta in the back.
text: Creasy steals a look in the mirror. Pinta stares
text: straight ahead. But when Creasy looks away, Pinta steals
text: a look at him.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: As the mercedes crosses an intersection, a white TOYOTA
text: COROLLA turns right, pulls in thirty meters behind it.
scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY
text: Creasy clocks the Corolla, frowns. He pulls a piece of
text: paper from his pocket. But nothing to write with.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Pinta, do you have a pencil?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I go to school, don't I?
text: Sarcasm. He stays calm, doesn't let on what he's
dialog: thinking.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Please?
text: Her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a
text: pencil. Creasy takes it, slows to let the Corolla catch
text: up. He squints into the mirror to read the plate.
text: Lisa is oblivious, but as Pinta looks back over her
dialog: shoulder...
text: BRAKE LIGHTS up ahead. Creasy lurches to a stop. The
text: Corolla swerves around them disappears ahead.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: LISA
text: The traffic takes some getting used to.
text: As Creasy cranes for a view, another WHITE Corolla comes
dialog: by headed the opposite way. They're everywhere. This
text: relaxes Creasy's paranoia. As he laughs to himself.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 34.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - CONVENT SCHOOL - DAY
text: They pull in through the gates. The Mercedes parks;
text: Creasy gets out. Pinta kisses her mother on the cheek.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Bye, Mom.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Don't forget your towel.
text: Pinta gets out with book bag and her towel. As she
text: starts to walk past Creasy without a word, he holds out
text: her pencil. She holds up, shows him a SECOND PENCIL,
text: continues on her way. Doesn't need him.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
text: Creasy gets back in, starts away.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: She has swimming practice today. You'll
dialog: need to pick her up at the pool.
text: Creasy just nods. He doesn't want anything to do with
text: Lisa either. Thoughtful, Lisa looks out the window.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I talked to her. She understands. She
dialog: won't bother you anymore.
text: As Creasy just drives.
scene_heading: EXT. AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: Creasy waits in the street, stands by the Mercedes. He
text: checks his watch, looks around. The minutes do not pass
text: quickly. He looks over as the restaurant door opens and
text: Lisa exits with Jordan Kalfus and his Latin wife EVELYN.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (sees him)
dialog: Creasy!
dialog: (stepping over)
dialog: Meet Jordan and Evelyn.
text: Creasy nods. They study him with interest.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: So you're the bodyguard?
dialog: (Creasy nods again)
dialog: You used to be, what did they used to
dialog: call it, a soldier of fortune?
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 35.
text: Jordan doesn't quite hide his disdain. Creasy nods a
text: final time, lets his eyes drift to a 1000 yard stare.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (giggles)
dialog: Does he talk?
text: As Lisa gives her a dirty look, Evelyn whispers...
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: He's sexy...
text: Jordan looks in the direction Creasy looks.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: You see any danger out there?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: The fear's worse than the reality.
text: Just a blankness from Creasy.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: I always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would
dialog: you take a bullet for your employer, for
dialog: Samuel?
text: A condescending smile as Jordan awaits his answer.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I wasn't hired to guard Mr. Ramos.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: For Pinta then?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Jordan!
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: If something happened, my reaction would
dialog: be to fight to protect her. I have
dialog: skills in that respect. Pinta would
dialog: benefit by the fact that... I'm a
dialog: soldier.
speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: What kind of an answer is that?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: The answer is the truth. The question is

dialog: Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch.
dialog: I promise not to let Evelyn spend too
dialog: much.
text: Evelyn doesn't see it, but Creasy does. Jordan just lets

text: As she and Evelyn head for the car, Creasy is there to
text: open the door.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
text: Creasy gets behind the wheel. Pulls into traffic. As he

dialog: Something odd about it all.
scene_heading: EXT. PUBLIC POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: Loud. Chaotic. Reminiscent of a lunatic asylum. Creasy
text: arrives at the public pool. A practice. Several
text: bodyguards gather at one end of the pool. Give Creasy a
text: less than friendly look. As he looks for Pinta...
text: A GUN goes off.
text: Sees: The smoke from the starting pistol as the SWIMMERS
text: splash into the water.
text: He sees Pinta in the pool. The fifty yard dash. She's
text: in fifth. Then fourth. Creasy walks along beside her.
text: Third. Second and closing. And at the wall, still
dialog: second.
text: She surfaces, frustrated. As she sees Creasy there...
scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES - DAY
text: Creasy drives. Pinta in back, writing in her notebook.
text: Not speaking, but a weird sort of harmony. Finally.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: You're fast.

scene_heading: INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Creasy sits in his chair drinking scotch. All alone
dialog: needless to say.
text: Creasy takes the instructional VHS on bodyguards that
text: Rayburn gave him and plugs it into the VCR. It's in
text: Japanese. Shakes his head. He switches off the VCR and
text: surfs the TV channels instead. Sees talk show with the
text: editor of REFORMA newspaper, ROSANNA GUERRERO, talking
dialog: about organized crime in Mexico.
text: From out the window, a CAW, then again. Yet again.
text: Finally, Creasy stands goes to the window. He leans out,
text: sees Pinta's window across the lawn from him.
text: Pinta standing on the terrace. Another CAW.
text: Creasy decides to play. He CAWS in return.
text: Pinta looks around. Creasy does a pretty good
dialog: impersonation.
text: Hears Pinta CAW again.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Hey... Pinta...
text: She looks up at him.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Do you think he'll come back?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Maybe. Did you hear him?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PINTA

speaker_heading: PINTA

speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I got you to talk, Creasy bear.

dialog: The Day of the Dead.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: You enjoy it for us, Pinta.
text: Lisa gives her a look. Don't make this harder than it has
text: to be. Finally, Pinta nods.
text: Creasy waits quite a discreet distance away by the
text: Mercedes. She steps over, stops to wave goodbye one last
text: time, then gets in back. As Creasy shuts the door.
scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES - MEXICO CITY ROAD - DAY
text: Creasy drives, glances in the mirror at Pinta in the back
text: seat. She wipes away a tear just as it forms.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: They'll be back in a week.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: They can stay for two weeks. I don't

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: The food is excellent, Maria. You have a

text: Maria beams with pleasure.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: My pleasure, Creasy.
text: Pinta enters in a RED SATIN DEVIL'S OUTFIT. She looks a
text: bit forlorn as she sits at opposite ends of the table
text: from Creasy. As she stares at her plate, Creasy starts
text: to laugh at what an odd sight she is. All dressed up and
dialog: no place to go.
text: Wrong move. Pinta stands, marches out of the room. As
text: Maria and Creasy exchange a look...
scene_heading: EXT./INT. WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY
text: Pinta the devil stares sadly out here window. Then there
text: it is! The macaw. Sitting on the opposite roof.
scene_heading: EXT. ATTIC WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY
text: Pinta pushes it open, climbs out onto the slope of the
text: roof. This doesn't look like such a good idea. As she
text: crosses, disappears over the peak.
dialog: It's a game of catch me if you can. 'Bird' looks at
text: Pinta right in the eye. She gingerly moves closer. The
text: bird moves away, just out of her reach each time.
speaker_heading: CHIMNEY
text: Pinta coming down the other slope. There's the macaw.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Come on. Come on. Bird!
text: The fourth time Pinta's fingers are centimeters away.
text: She reaches and suddenly slides along the slick tile
text: covering this section of the roof. Frank's in the yard

text: Near the edge, she manages to stop. Whew!
text: She scrambles up a few feet. A tile snaps off. She
text: slides again. This time right off the edge.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 40.
text: She catches the rain gutter. Hangs thirty feet above the

speaker_heading: PINTA'S VOICE
speaker_heading: CREASY!
text: Creasy is on his feet, out the door in a heartbeat.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE YARD - DAY
text: Creasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Pinta!
text: She's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head.

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: It hurts.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: (Short)
dialog: Everywhere!
text: She puts her hands to the left side of her ribs. Creasy
text: carefully probes with his fingers. She winces.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I don't think they're broken. Anywhere
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: My ankle.
text: As Maria huffs and puffs her way up.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm going to get you out, okay?
text: Pinta nods. Creasy eases his arms under, around her,

text: his arms.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 41.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Oh, Creasy...
text: And she bursts into tears. Maria looks up at the thirty

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: It's okay. She's just scared.
text: Creasy cradles her, pats her back. As Pinta says his
dialog: name like a mantra...
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DETROIT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Okay, good, you're sure.

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: The night you arrived, Mom asked you if

dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: White lie. I didn't have a family. But
dialog: I did have two kids. They're adults now.
text: It's a sensitive subject so Pinta moves on. She nods.
text: Creasy looks at the bear. An odd beat.

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Do you always sleep with him?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I'm too old for him. Don't tell my

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I don't talk to them much. Does he have
dialog: a name?
text: Pinta thinks just a beat, then shakes her head 'no'.
dialog: Liar.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I spoke to your mother. She sends her
dialog: love.
text: Pinta nods. Creasy stands there a beat, then heads for
text: the door. Almost out, he looks back.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Some bodyguard I turned out to be. Good
dialog: night, Pinta.
text: He's halfway out the door.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Creasy? Could you play the song?
text: Creasy is confused a moment, but when he sees her open

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Blue Bayou. You got it.

scene_heading: EXT. MERCEDES - RAMOS HOUSE - DAY
text: Pedro the 'car wash guy' puts the finishing touches to
dialog: the Mercedes.
text: Using crutches, Pinta hobbles over. Creasy opens the

text: hesitates.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I think I'll sit in the front. There's
dialog: more room for my foot.
text: Creasy makes no big deal of it. He takes her crutches,

text: and watches. Creasy calls to him.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 43.
speaker_heading: PINTA
text: He's only allowed to travel in the car on

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Did you sleep alright?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: How's the ankle? Can you put your weight
dialog: on it?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: It's not too bad. Will it take a long

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: In a week you should be fine.

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I will.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - EVENING

speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: PINTA
text: It was in a book at school. Concubine.

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Well, it's a sort of wife.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: But the Emperor of China had 1000 of

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: In the West, it's one wife for one

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: It must be difficult having lots of
dialog: wives.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: You feel sorry for the husband?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Yeah. Can you imagine my mother

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Creasy, you're smiling.
text: He reverts to a frown. Now Pinta bursts out laughing.
text: And Creasy can't help but smile again.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I guess I am.
text: Pinta changes subject.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: So how come you know so much about those

speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: No, no, come back.
text: Pinta turns in the water, looks back at him.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you
dialog: react. You go. Don't listen for the

text: on the sound itself.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Don't worry. You will.

scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES - ROLLING
text: On the way to school. Pinta is stealing looks at
text: Creasy's right hand. She knows the answer must be
text: serious, but she has to ask.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Creasy, what happened to your hand?
text: Creasy looks at her a moment, deciding. Pinta
text: practically holds her breath, watches him, knows the
text: answer may come. Creasy checks the mirror, watches the
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: A man asked me questions once. He smoked
text: a lot. There was no ashtray.
dialog: That's it. End of explanation. Creasy continues
text: watching the road. Pinta watches him.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Remember you asked me what state I was
dialog: from?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Where you're from isn't so much about
dialog: geography; it's about events. Where
dialog: you're from is what happened to you.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Good things happen, too, Creasy.
dialog: (smiles big)

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: (after a beat)

speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Creasy, tomorrow, after you drop off
dialog: Pinta, could you come back to take me to

text: Creasy nods. They both continue to look at her. She

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Alright, I'll leave you two to your

scene_heading: EXT. HAIRDRESSERS - ZONA ROSA - DAY
text: Mexico City traffic is heavy. Cars and people. Creasy

text: He can just catch a glimpse of Lisa in the shop.
text: Suddenly the traffic seems to finish, expending itself.
text: The street goes ominously quiet. Creasy's antennae go
dialog: up.
text: A police car comes prowling down the empty street.
text: Creasy makes eye contact with the guys up front.
text: Then, Creasy spots a BUSINESSMAN coming out of a doorway
text: with a BODYGUARD attached. The bodyguard is speaking
text: into a two-way radio.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 48.
text: Creasy's sixth sense tweaks as a Mercedes 500 pulls up to

text: Lisa exits the hairdresser's. Looks stunning.
text: Creasy starts across the street toward her.
text: A second car squeals around the corner behind the
text: Mercedes and everything goes to Hell.
text: GUNFIRE erupts.
text: And then Creasy is there.
text: His arm around Lisa's waist, sweeping her off her feet.
text: The next thing she knows she flattened on the ground in a
text: shop doorway, Creasy on top of her. Shielding her.
text: The bodyguard beside the businessman is killed. The body
text: guard in the Mercedes trades a full magazine before he's
dialog: shot.
text: A PEDESTRIAN is killed.
text: Liza screams as the glass above and behind them shatters.
text: The businessman is hustled into the back of the second
dialog: car.
text: Lisa sees the gun in Creasy's hands.
text: She hears the slamming of the car door, the screeching of
text: tires. A parked VAN also hauling ass out of there. But
text: then she's aware of something else.
text: Creasy on top of her. She feels his weight, his heat...
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Don't move.
text: She watches as he rises, goes to the curb. One bodyguard
text: is sprawled dead across the ground. Red blood on the
text: sidewalk. As Lisa closes her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES - STREET - DAY
text: Lisa sits in the backseat. Through the window we can see

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Murdering people in the street... You
dialog: had your gun, why didn't you shoot them?
text: The shoulders in front of her just shrug.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Nothing to do with me. Or you. Besides,
dialog: there was another one in the passenger
text: side of the van with a sawed-off shotgun.
dialog: If I'd started shooting his friends, he
dialog: would've had me. And you.
text: Quiet a beat. Lisa pulls a sliver of glass from her
text: hair, looks from it to Creasy.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: A minimum close protection team consists

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY UNDERPASS - MEXICO CITY - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - PINTA'S SCHOOL - DAY

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I dropped her at home.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't
dialog: she just come with you?
text: Creasy doesn't answer, just grunts. Pinta keeps looking
text: at him and it suddenly all makes sense.
text: He looks over at her, starts to say something, then
dialog: thinks better of it. Finally...
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Do you think my mother likes you?
text: She's for sure pissed. Definitely aware and definitely
text: jealous. Creasy's a bit amazed, not sure how to respond.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I think she's afraid of me. But not the
dialog: same way most people are.
dialog: Pinta considers this. Then..
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I know you're not.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Are you afraid of me?
text: Creasy looks at her, almost like he's deciding.

speaker_heading: PINTA

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
speaker_heading: PINTA
text: The gunshot holds no fear.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: You welcome the sound. The sound is what

text: Pinta smiles at the sound. Creasy smiles at the sight.
scene_heading: EXT. RAMOS POOL - DAY
text: WHACK! Pinta bolts from the blocks. SPLASHES.

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I want to thank you, Creasy. For what

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Your father has business.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Why today? And why'd she have to go with

text: Creasy shrugs. No comforting answer for her. He looks

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Good luck. I'll be waiting here when

speaker_heading: PINTA

speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: Mr. Creasy, nice to see you.
text: And now Creasy is completely out of place.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: Pinta's parents are in Los Angeles. I
dialog: was going to wait in the courtyard,
dialog: but...
text: She takes his arm, pats his hand.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: Today you are her father.
text: As Creasy lets this sink in, looks out where Pinta is
text: warming up. Sister Anna smiles, heads off to a group of
text: parents. We're left with Creasy. Confused Creasy. But
text: clarity is creeping in. As the sky opens up around
dialog: him...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: STARTER'S PISTOL
text: Pointed up at precisely 45 degrees. BAAAANGG!
scene_heading: STARTING BLOCKS

speaker_heading: CREASY
text: Sees it. She hasn't even hit the water and he already

speaker_heading: PINTA
text: SPLASH! Ten meters in before she breaks the surface.

speaker_heading: THE CROWD

speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I won, Creasy! I won!
text: She loves him... Creasy hugs her. He loves her back.
scene_heading: INT. TRADITIONAL RESTAURANT - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
text: A MARIACHI BAND roams. We see Creasy but not who he's
text: with. A date? As we come around it's Pinta. Sitting
text: with them, Rayburn and his wife. And a sleeping four-
dialog: year-old.
dialog: NOTE: Rethink following dialogue with reference to
dialog: Creasy / Rayburn background.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: My Dad said all your friends were dead.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: All but one. The most important one.
dialog: When we were eighteen, we made an
dialog: agreement to "take the world" together.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in

dialog: what happened to the plan?

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I hung up on him. When I met Alicia, I
dialog: got it.
text: Alicia blows Creasy a kiss.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Can I kiss her now, or after you've gone
dialog: to bed?
text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Okay, I think now is as good as time as
dialog: any.
text: She takes out a velvet pouch from her pocket. She holds
text: it out to Creasy. He looks at her, takes it from her
text: hand. His thick fingers fumble with a delicate
text: drawstring.
text: Pinta waits for his reaction as Creasy pours a simple,
text: but fine MEDALLION and chain into the palm of his hand.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I bought it with my own money. I saved
dialog: it.
text: Creasy is really affected, tries to hide it. She takes
text: it, slips it over his head.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: It's St. Jude, the patron saint of lost
dialog: causes.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: And hard cases. Creasy's the reason St.
dialog: Jude became a Saint in the first place.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Yeah, that's right.
text: Creasy looks at it, considers.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Thank you, Pinta, it's beautiful.

speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Come on, baby. I feel like a third

text: They dance. A waiter steps over, refills Creasy's water

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Could I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Could I stop you?
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: You don't drink like you used to.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: That's not a question.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I know because I go in your room and
dialog: check the bottles.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Still not a question.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: My mom drinks, too... Why do people
dialog: drink, Creasy?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Now that's a question. I don't know
dialog: about your Mom. For me, the problem
dialog: isn't in the glass. The problem's in
dialog: between my ears.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: You think too much?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't

speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: That's ridiculous.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: It's not.

speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I've just been so busy, Lisa.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: He has to go.
text: Samuel looks at her, wonders at her adamancy.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: The three month trial ends in a week. I
dialog: just won't confirm the position. That
dialog: possibility was understood when I hired
dialog: him.
text: Lisa gives him a look. She wants it done today. But for
text: once, Samuel is stronger than his wife.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: I won't create bad feelings. And another

text: Off the escalator, they turn toward Creasy waiting

speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I'm going to keep people safe someday.

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Be a swimmer.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I could do it. Remember the day you
dialog: wanted the pencil? I know why. And I
dialog: saw that car again. I wrote the license
dialog: number in my notebook. Except I missed
dialog: the last number.
text: Creasy checks his mirror, nothing back there now. He

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: You'll have to show me that number when
dialog: we get home.
scene_heading: EXT. VIA BUENOS AIRES - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: A wide avenue. The Mercedes pulls up parks in the only

text: tinkling above. Then:
text: Creasy looks at her, smiles to himself. Pinta looks
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Continue to play in the wrong key, like

speaker_heading: PINTA

dialog: You got that right.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: You'll be back in the water in twenty-

text: Creasy presses the buzzer. As they wait, Pinta sees
text: something, reaches down to pull a DANDELION from a crack
text: where the sidewalk meets the wall. She smiles at Creasy.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: For you, Creasy.
text: Creasy takes it from her. He's saved by the bell as a
text: second buzzer answers the first. Creasy pulls the door
text: open. Pinta heaves a resigned sigh.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Remember 'dyslexic.'
text: As Pinta nods, disappears inside...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 2ND FLOOR WINDOW
text: The curtains rustle in the breeze. The sound of badly
text: played scales. And then sounds of frustration.
text: Then, the sound of the teacher playing. Pinta appears in
text: the window for just a moment.
speaker_heading: CREASY
text: Looking up from the window of the Mercedes. As Pinta is

speaker_heading: THE STREET
text: Creasy leaning against the Mercedes. Traffic pounding
text: by. The dandelion is stuck in a button hole of his
dialog: shirt.
text: And then suddenly traffic thins out. Reminiscent of the
dialog: previous two kidnappings. It's a process. Creasy
text: straightens up.
text: A Judicial POLICE CAR cruises by, slowly. Creasy makes
text: eye contact with the two cops up front. The same guys
dialog: who were at Zona Rosa.
text: Creasy starts across the street toward the apartment
text: building. At the same time as...
text: The door bangs open. Pinta exiting. She spots Creasy, a
text: huge grin on her face. She was not accepted.
text: And a white TOYOTA COROLLA coming the other way.
text: The police car reverses back, cutting Creasy off from
text: Pinta. The COPS getting out, big smiles on their faces.
speaker_heading: THE COROLLA
text: Slides to a stop in front of Pinta, blocking her path to
text: Creasy. And as TWO MEN leap out from the backseat...
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: (drawing his 9mm)
dialog: Run, Pinta, run!
text: But she's rooted with fear.
text: And the men are almost on her.
text: Creasy raises the 9mm overhead. BANG!
text: And the sound frees her. Pinta runs!
text: Ducking under a flailing arm. Quick and lithe. Trying
text: to reach her bodyguard.
text: The cops drawing Uzi's..
text: Creasy plants himself, the Sig Sauer now level. He fires
text: twice into COP ONE, dead center in the chest.
text: Pinta runs. Chased by the TWO MEN.
text: COP TWO returns fire wildly: the Mercedes hit in a ten
text: bullet line.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 63.
text: Creasy fires two more rounds into COP TWO who's hit high
text: in the chest and throat. Precise.
text: Creasy pivots, strides calmly forward, firing at the men
text: chasing Pinta. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
text: MAN ONE goes down, hit in the ribs.
text: A bullet slams Creasy in the back, fired from inside the
dialog: Corolla.
text: Creasy fires back. BOOM! BOOM!
text: MAN THREE falls dead, hit just below his nose, just above
text: his teeth. The FAT DRIVER fires, now, and Creasy is hit
text: in the shoulder.
text: And Pinta disappears into the traffic. Gone.
text: MAN TWO, who has abandoned chasing Pinta, fires again.
text: Creasy drops the 9mm as he is hit in the stomach. He
text: falls to his knees.
text: The dandelion starts to come apart. Drifting away, piece
dialog: by piece.
text: Slack-jawed, Creasy looks about. Sees the FAT DRIVER
text: heaving himself out of the Corolla while MAN TWO scans

text: She got away! Creasy smiles even as he crumples over on
dialog: his side.
speaker_heading: PINTA'S VOICE
speaker_heading: CREASY!
text: And Pinta is back. Running toward Creasy. She can't

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: NOOO...
text: She runs to him, wraps her arms around him.
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Creasy...
text: MAN TWO catches up, tears Pinta away, starts back for the

speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: Creasy!
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 64.
text: It's not a cry for help. It's anguish for him.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Pinta...
text: MAN TWO crams her in the back seat, follows. The fat
text: driver gets back in behind the wheel. As the door slams
text: shut, wheels spin, grip and the Corolla accelerates away.
text: We just see Pinta look back through the rear windshield.
text: An anguished image before she's pulled back down.
text: Creasy makes a wish. Not for himself, but for her.
speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: JORDAN
dialog: He has a heart condition. Angina. He

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle

speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: VOICE

scene_heading: INT. DARKENED HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Creasy being wheeled down the hall by a tough plain-

speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: What's the deal here?
speaker_heading: ROSANNA

scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AZTECS - NIGHT
text: Samuel's car is parked on the south side of the bridge.
text: A shirtless Samuel carries two large duffle bags
text: containing ten million dollars across the bridge. We see
text: Tazinari again dialing up his cell phone.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
text: Leave the money in the trunk of the car
text: with white paper taped to the windshield,

speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Remember, I am a professional. If you
dialog: keep your word, I will keep mine. If you

scene_heading: INT. VETERINARIAN'S CLINIC - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: Cages of mangy looking mutts. Pull back to reveal Creasy
text: on his hospital bed, IVs and all.
text: Rayburn sits nearby. He looks up as Creasy stirs, wakes
text: again. Creasy's eyes flicker to his friend, ask the
text: first question on his mind. Pinta...
text: Rayburn looks away, can't face his friend. And suddenly,
dialog: Creasy knows.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: She's dead. Isn't she?
text: Rayburn finally nods. And with that gesture, God takes
text: everything away. It might as well be the Old Testament.
dialog: And we are about to get Biblical.
text: Creasy turns his head, looks up at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
text: It was a fuck up. Someone hijacked the
dialog: drop. The kidnapper, his nephew got
dialog: killed.
text: CU of Creasy's face with his back to the room. A
text: thousand yard stare. His eyes glaze over.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK
scene_heading: INT. CAR - MEXICO CITY
text: CU of Pinta looking up at Creasy. The camera ramps into
text: Pinta's smile. A small, but a sinificant moment in terms
dialog: of their connection.
scene_heading: INT. LISA &amp; SAMUEL'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: The curtains are drawn tight. Slivers of light
text: illuminate the darkened room. Lisa sits on the end of

speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: You betrayed me. You killed my nephew
dialog: and took the money.
speaker_heading: K&amp;R AGENT
dialog: No, not us...No we did not.

speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: She's dead Creasy.
text: Creasy blinks away a solitary tear.
scene_heading: INT. VETERNARIANS CLINIC HALLWAY - DAY
text: Dogs barking constantly. Manzano walks the hall flanked
text: by a DOCTOR and a NURSE. A second policeman, Manzano's
text: adjutant, brings up the rear carrying two heavy binders.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: She's dead. They fucked with 'the
dialog: process' and his nephew died.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: He suffered gunshot wounds to the upper
text: extremity, chest and abdomen. He has a
text: collapsed lung which is stabilized,
dialog: injured his spleen, which we may have to
text: remove and ruptured his intestine. He's
dialog: on strict bedrest or there's a good
dialog: chance we could lose him.
speaker_heading: NURSE
text: A strange man. He has much experience of
dialog: hospitals.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: Did he say so?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: No. But a nurse knows.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MUGSHOT
text: Manzano and the adjutant have pulled chairs up alongside
text: the bed. The adjutant flips through one of the binders.
text: Each page holds a single MUGSHOT. Each time Creasy
text: shakes his head, the adjutant flips to the next photo.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 75.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: Nothing?
text: Creasy shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: Excellent work by the way. Three men
text: dead. Only ten rounds fired.
text: Creasy shakes his head at the next shot.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: If two of the men in my division could
dialog: shoot like that, I could get rid of the
dialog: other thirty-six.
text: One of the dogs starts to bark. Another. Soon ten of
text: them. The VET ASSISTANT enters, shouts at them to quiet.
text: Manzano ignores it, motions the adjutant to flip pages.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: What am I doing here?
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: Believe it or not, you're safe here. The
dialog: Judicial police will kill you. If they
dialog: can.
dialog: (re: book)
dialog: This page?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: No.
text: The adjutant reaches the last page. Creasy shakes his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: You have a rather checkered past. Mr.
dialog: Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Am I a suspect?
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: No. It would be convenient, but no.
text: As Manzano packs up his mugshot books...
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen.
dialog: Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 76.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: All these photos you just saw were of

scene_heading: INT. DOG PENS - NIGHT
text: Creasy sitting on the gurney, Rayburn buttons his shirt.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Okay?
text: Creasy nods. Rayburn gets Creasy's arm over his
text: shoulder, eases him off the gurney till his feet hit the
dialog: floor.
text: Creasy winces, but the two of them start to walk out.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK SIDE - VETERINARIAN CLINIC - NIGHT
text: An SUV rolling away. Lights out, engine off. It coasts
text: a hundred yards before the engine turns over. Rayburn
text: behind the wheel. As it sweeps past camera...
scene_heading: INT. SUV - ROLLING - NIGHT
text: Rayburn constantly checking the rear view. No pursuit in
text: sight. He looks over at Creasy.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: How do you feel?
text: Creasy looks over at him, finally shrugs.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Stomach's gone. But... okay.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: I'll get you up to the border. Friend of
dialog: mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop
dialog: you right at the hospital.
text: Creasy's not really listening. He's been looking in the
text: passenger side view mirror. Nothing back there. Creasy
text: sits up. A bit of an effort.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Got a thing I gotta do first.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 77.
scene_heading: EXT. VIA BUENOS AIRES - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: Scene of the crime. Typical Mexican 'roadside shrines'
text: where the policemen fell. A pyre of flowers where Pinta
text: was scooped up, Creasy's blood still staining the
text: sidewalk alongside. A car pulls up...
text: Rosanna Guerrero gets out with a REPORTER and
text: PHOTOGRAPHER. She directs them in Spanish. The reporter
text: starts making notes; the photographer snaps photos of the
dialog: shrine.
text: Rosanna stands by the flower pyre. Something catches her
text: eye. A balled-up piece of paper and a half-burned candle
text: beside it. As she picks it up, she spots something else.
text: Across the street, Creasy walks. An awkward hitch in his
text: stride. Outside the apartment of the piano teacher,
text: surveying the scene with experienced eyes. Unaware of
speaker_heading: Rosanna
speaker_heading: CREASY (FLASHBACK)
text: Corolla. Muzzle flashes. Pinta screaming...
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE
dialog: Creasy...
text: Creasy wheels. There's Rosanna.
speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: A lot of people are looking for you.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I guess that makes you the smart one.
speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: We're interested in the same thing. I'm
text: writing a story.
text: Creasy walks away from her. Rosanna catches up and holds
text: out a plastic ziploc.
speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: This might interest you. I found it
text: across the street.
text: Creasy empties the contents of the ziplock into his hand.
text: A small ball of paper and the remains of a black candle.
text: Creasy unballs the paper. It's a photo.
text: FLASH: Creasy at the police station. His photo taken.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 78.
speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The
dialog: religion of La Hermanidad. There's a
dialog: curse on you.
speaker_heading: CREASY
text: It's a little late.
text: He hands it back to her, not interested. As he turns to
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: What are you going to do?
text: Creasy doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: I can help. I have a situation Mr.
dialog: Creasy. There is a brotherhood called Le
dialog: Hermanidad which protects both high
dialog: ranking Government officials, corrupt
dialog: police, and organized crime at a level
dialog: that is very difficult for me to touch.
dialog: I believe you were a victim of this
dialog: organization. You and this story may
text: help to unmask them.
text: Creasy looks carefully at Rosanna. Right now he trusts
dialog: no one.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Thank you.
text: He walks away towards Rayburn.
scene_heading: EXT. RAMOS HOUSE - DAWN
text: The SUV parked a discreet distance away. Rayburn grinds
text: out another cigarette, mutters to himself.
scene_heading: INT. CREASY'S ROOM - DAWN
text: Bruno lets him in. Nothings been touched. Creasy
text: retrieves his bullet from his shrine along with the
dialog: 'Jack', Marlboros, and New Testament. Puts his few
text: possessions in a bag. MOVE WITH him as he silently
text: crosses out into the hall, heads toward...
speaker_heading: PINTA'S ROOM
text: He stands there a moment. His pain entirely his own.
text: And then he goes to Pinta's little desk, finds her school
text: notebook buried in a pile. He flips through it until he
dialog: finds...
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 79.
text: The LICENSE PLATE NUMBER Pinta jotted for him. Then he
text: notices the notebook is really a diary. Every page
text: references her day to day relationship with Creasy. "I
text: love you Creasy Bear." He hears soft footsteps. Creasy
dialog: turns.
text: Lisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown, her eyes
text: drilling through Creasy.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (softly)
dialog: You let them take her. She loved you and
dialog: you let them take her.
text: Creasy just blinks at her as the words blast through him.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Because...
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I was already dead.
text: Eyes brimming, Lisa has no more words. But Creasy comes
text: bearing cold comfort.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I want you to know something.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I'm going to kill them. Anyone who opens
text: their eyes at me.
text: Lisa doesn't answer, but the connection between them is
text: suddenly monumental. Finally, Creasy looks away. He
text: picks up Pinta's battered, old TEDDY BEAR.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Creasy...
text: He turns, but she doesn't look back at him.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Kill them, Creasy.
text: Creasy nods. He will. As he continues away...
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: Kill them all.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN / POOL - RAMOS HOUSE
text: Creasy exits the house and stands by the pool. Frank
text: appears tail wagging and attempts to comfort Creasy.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 80.
text: Leaves blow across the surface of the water. Underwater
text: slow motion, a wall turn. It looks remarkably like
dialog: Pinta.
text: "Blue Bayou" drifts through the air. Soft, in the ether
text: somewhere. Creasy hears it, half raises his head.
speaker_heading: PINTA'S VOICE
dialog: Why Blue Bayou, Creasy? Is that where
dialog: you're from?
text: She's standing behind him. Wearing the all too familiar
text: one piece swimsuit, she towels her wet hair.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Blue Bayou is a dream, Pinta. Like you.
speaker_heading: PINTA GHOST
dialog: Dreams are beautiful, Creasy-Bear, but
dialog: life is better.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: PINTA GHOST
dialog: I have to watch you now.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON CREASY
text: The words are a salve, a balm. He turns, looks back over
text: his shoulder. He's all alone.
scene_heading: INT. SUV - NEAR RAMOS - MEXICO CITY - DAWN
text: Rayburn looks over his shoulder, sees Creasy walking down
text: the street. Clutching a teddy bear.
text: Creasy gets in the car. Rayburn drives.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: You'll be Stateside by suppertime.
text: No answer. Finally, as Rayburn lights a cigarette...
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm going to need help, Ray.
text: Rayburn grinds out the cigarette he just lit, knows what
text: just was asked. Creasy needs help unleashing a plague.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 81.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day
dialog: the shape you're in. Unless you stop
dialog: bleeding you should have your spleen
dialog: removed.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Yes or no?
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave
dialog: that up. Anything else? It's yours.
text: Creasy reaches into a pocket, hands Rayburn a hand
text: written list. Rayburn reads, his eyes widening.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Jesus, Creasy. You're talking war.
scene_heading: INT. PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL - MEXICO CITY
text: The surface breaks as Creasy enters the water wearing a
text: red T-shirt to hide the bandages. He begins a slow

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - SUBURBS MEXICO CITY - NIGHT *RETHINK
speaker_heading: LOCATION*
text: Fluorescents flicker on. A Fiat up on the hydraulic

text: One of the two men unlocks it. Creasy and Rayburn enter.
speaker_heading: PARTITION
text: Three long steel tables. Covered with weapons.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: Candy store. Every town in Mexico has

text: Creasy stops by the pistols.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: I know it's old fashioned, but it's
dialog: reliable. Like us.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 82.
text: Next he's looking at grenades. He hefts two different
dialog: choices.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I need less than standard packing. Can
dialog: you knock up a case for fifteen of each?
text: He picks up a double barrel shotgun, checks the line of
text: it. He flicks open the breach, snaps it shut.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: (indicating)
dialog: Cut the stock here. The barrel here.
dialog: Make sure you file it smooth.

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Maybe I can help your situation and you

speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: So where do we begin?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I need the name and address of the owner
dialog: of a Toyota Corolla, license number

speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: So what do I get in return?

text: Creasy hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. AFI OPERATION CENTER - MEXICO CITY - DAY
text: Manzano, Rosanna, and technicians are listening to voice

speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death
text: before he can do anything.
speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: He sounded strong to me. Stronger than
dialog: we are.
text: Rosanna pauses.
speaker_heading: ROSANNA
text: Because he's outside. Because he's not
dialog: tied to the same system we are.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: We did voice analysis of the last five

dialog: Listen to this.

speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: I know this. Your point?
speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is

text: Rosanna waits for a response. None.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 84.
speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: Then what do you have to lose?
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: It's a moral issue. On one hand you're

dialog: way we are feeding the problem that

scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MEXICO CITY - DAY

text: Unaware he's being shadowed by a man on a scooter.
dialog: Creasy.
scene_heading: EXT. FIAT 500 - DAY
text: As it comes to a stop. Jorge gets out. We hear the

scene_heading: EXT. PUBLIC BUILDING - DAY
text: Creasy watches and waits. Time lapse of the building
text: Jorge exits the building still trying to get the last

text: struggles to get behind the wheel of the Fiat. The car
dialog: is tiny.
text: Someone's getting in on the passenger side.
text: As Jorge starts to protest, Creasy rams a Sig into his
text: gut. At the same time, he takes Jorge's gun from its

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Drive.
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: Do you know who I am?
speaker_heading: CREASY

scene_heading: EXT. CLIFFSIDE - MEXICAN CITY - DAY

speaker_heading: CREASY'S VOICE
dialog: Stop here. Turn off the ignition.
scene_heading: INT. FIAT 500 - DAY
text: Jorge does as he's told. Suddenly the Sig comes down
text: hard. WHACK! As Jorge's vision explodes...
scene_heading: INT. FIAT 500 - DAY
text: Still in the driver's seat, Jorge wakes. The first thing
text: he sees is that his hands are taped to the steering wheel
text: with his pudgy white fingers exposed. He is naked,
text: reminiscent of the 18 year old in the opening sequence.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Can you hear me?
text: Jorge nods, the pain in his head blinding.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I am going to ask questions. If you
dialog: don't answer, fully and truthfully, you
dialog: will suffer much more than you have to.
text: Creasy opens Pinta's notebook to a blank page near the
text: end. He clicks open a pen.
text: Creasy presses in the car's cigarette lighter.
text: Then he opens a buck knife. Jorge winces at the sound of
text: the blade locking.
speaker_heading: CREASY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to cut your fingers off. One
dialog: by one. If I have to.
text: The cigarette lighter pops back out.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: That's to cauterize the stubs.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 86.
text: Holy sweet Jesus... Sweat drips down Jorge's forehead.

speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: Do you know who I am?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: I am the President of La Hermanidad.
text: Without warning Creasy reaches up with the buck knife, a
text: flash of steel.
text: The big man howls, his left ear suddenly missing, starts
text: an epic struggle, practically breaking the wheel off the
text: steering column. He is like a bucking Rhinoceros.
text: He howls as Creasy sprays his face with pepper spray.
scene_heading: EXT. FIAT 500 - DAY
text: The passenger side door opens and Creasy stumbles out.
text: Some of the pepper spray has gotten in his face as well.
text: Creasy wipes his tearing eyes. And then he turns.
text: Hefting the knife in his hand, he marches back toward the car.
speaker_heading: JORGE'S VOICE
dialog: No! No!
text: And then a terrible SCREAM. BLOOD squirts against the
text: inside of the windshield. The car rocks on its shocks.
text: And then another terrible SCREAM.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: JORGE
text: Stares at the stump of his right forefinger, smoke rising

text: And Creasy looking at him, devoid of emotion.
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: Wh- wh- what do you want to know?
text: It takes a moment for Creasy to come back. He picks up

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 87.
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: I don't know. We were just given

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Ordered by who?
text: Jorge hesitates. As Creasy sets the pen down...
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: I don't know.
text: Creasy jerks back Jorge's middle finger, raises the
dialog: knife.
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: (a mile a minute)
dialog: I don't know! We work in parts. A voice
dialog: calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the
dialog: target to the guardians. We don't even
dialog: know them. They might transfer to other
dialog: guardians. The negotiators and the
text: bosses don't even see the target. They
dialog: just make the deal!
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Who ordered it?
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.

dialog: Where do I find him?
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: (shrugs; terrified)

speaker_heading: SANDRI (Italian Immigrant)

speaker_heading: RAYBURN

speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: And they took that away.
speaker_heading: RAYBURN
dialog: A man can be an artist in anything.
dialog: Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if

speaker_heading: TAZINARI
dialog: I don't know him. I saw the opportunity
dialog: and got lucky.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Lucky how?
speaker_heading: TAZINARI
dialog: That he used policemen. That you killed
dialog: them, it made it a police matter. The
dialog: Ramos family couldn't refuse our
dialog: involvement.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: TAZINARI
dialog: And I had my men ready.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: You stole the drop.
text: MORE FLASHES: As we see this happen. POV from opposite

text: gets shot. The kidnapper running the show sounds like
text: Woody Woodpecker, high pitched squeaky voice.
speaker_heading: CREASY (CONT'D)
dialog: You done it before?
text: Tazinari doesn't answer. Creasy gives the Magnum a

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: O.K. So tell me more.
speaker_heading: TAZINARI
dialog: There was no ten million dollars.

speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: TAZINARI

speaker_heading: CREASY

speaker_heading: TAZINARI

speaker_heading: TAZINARI

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: As Creasy thinks. Tazinari has been stretched to his

speaker_heading: TAZINARI
dialog: That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry
dialog: for the girl. But it was business! I'm
dialog: a professional.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: That's what everybody keeps saying.
text: Creasy switches off the tape recorder and pockets it.

scene_heading: EXT. FREEWAY EMERGENCY OFF RAMP - DAY

speaker_heading: ROSANNA

scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING
text: Samuel eats dinner silently. Lisa just stares into
dialog: space, nursing a vodka. Even great marriages cannot

text: The door opens and they expect to see Maria with the

dialog: dinner guest.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: (to Samuel)
dialog: I'm going to talk to your wife. If you
dialog: move or say one word, I'll kill you.
text: He takes a Colt Officer model .45 semi-automatic pistol
text: out of his waistband and lays it on the table in
dialog: preparation for something, we don't know what. He turns
dialog: to Lisa.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm going to tell you a story. Your
dialog: lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him
dialog: talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million
text: into his U.S. bank account. Colonel
text: Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He
dialog: hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5
dialog: million. If my arithmetic is correct it
dialog: means $5 million remains.
text: Creasy looks to Samuel.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Your husband magically had five million
dialog: deposited in a U.S. bank account last
dialog: Friday.
text: Lisa's eyes never leave Creasy's...trying to discern
dialog: whether this is true or not.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Planned what?
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 109.
speaker_heading: CREASY
text: An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for
dialog: Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm
dialog: sure he thought she'd sit there for three
text: days eating pizza and watching TV. It
dialog: didn't work out that way. Everything got
dialog: fucked up when I killed the cops and
dialog: Tazinari saw an opportunity.
text: Lisa screams. Creasy gestures with a finger to his lips.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: On the surface it was low risk and high
dialog: return. This was the third autosequestra
dialog: Jordan had organized for clients. The
dialog: other two succeeded.
text: Samuel looks to Lisa.
speaker_heading: SAMUEL
dialog: Our lifestyle was in jeopardy. My pain
dialog: and weakness only fueled your anger and
dialog: determination. I wasn't sure about
dialog: whether to go through with it or not.
dialog: Then I woke up one day and it was done.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Jordan was supposed to take care of it.
text: Through all of the above, Creasy removes the special
text: bullet held in the seam of his wallet. The misfire. He
text: empties the other cartridges from his gun.
text: Lisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional
text: outburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood
text: from his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms
text: beneath his. He appears strong and decisive for the
dialog: first time.
text: Creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the
text: magazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: CREASY
text: A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells
dialog: the truth. And the truth will set you
dialog: free.
text: Creasy hands Samuel the gun.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: In many ways I think this bullet should
dialog: be shared between you and Lisa.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 110.

text: A GUNSHOT.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. MEXICO CITY - NIGHT
text: Life moves on with its brutal inevitability. This is a

speaker_heading: PINTA'S VOICE
text: From the backseat I can see Creasy's eyes
text: in the mirror. He watches and thinks.
dialog: He never smiles. I wish I was back in
dialog: the front seat with him. I wish he would
dialog: smile.
text: Creasy looks up from the notebook and out at the city.
text: And a smile comes. But it's bitter and hopeless.
text: It's half grief, half not knowing where to go next, what
text: to do. And he's dying. He knows that too. Creasy dials
text: a number on a cell phone.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Hola...
speaker_heading: ROSANNA'S VOICE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN

speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got
text: into the house on the pretext of giving
dialog: cholera shots. We had to inject the
dialog: whole Barrio. We bugged the house and

dialog: at Rosanna. Now's the time to really

scene_heading: CREASY - SURVEILLANCE POV
text: Cameras whirring. Video being shot. He hasn't arrived
text: alone. As he disappears inside...
scene_heading: INT. CLOSED RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: The OWNER watches nervously as Creasy approaches wearing
text: a wool CAP. A pale attempt at disguising his identity.
text: There's a newspaper folded on his dais, more photos of
text: Creasy, his dead targets, the story of his vendetta.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm looking for Rosanna Guerrero.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: This way.
text: Empty restaurant, chairs on tables. An exterior

text: he sees the only person waiting for him is Manzano. As
text: Manzano smiles.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: (holds up paper)
dialog: Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: It's what you and Rosanna named me.
dialog: Right?

speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens

dialog: (laughs at himself)
dialog: The last few days may represent the best
dialog: police work of my life.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: The same thing as you. Except, my reach
dialog: isn't as long as yours. My father was a
dialog: policemen, did you know that?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I don't know shit about you.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: He was one of the original founders of
dialog: 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it
dialog: represented good not evil.
text: Manzano smiles; he likes Creasy.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: He was murdered. And now here I am.
text: Trying to honor his memory. Hamstrung by
dialog: bureaucracy and corruption. The
dialog: organization that he began now protects
dialog: criminals at the highest level where I
dialog: would need a Presidential finding in
dialog: order to expose it...or you.
text: The WAITER steps over; Manzano waves him off.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: My family lives in Miami. Because of the
dialog: death threats.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 114.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: It galls me to watch you. You can do as
dialog: much in days as I can in years. Men like
dialog: the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of
dialog: everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Are you going to arrest me or talk me to
dialog: death?
text: Manzano laughs again. Genuine. Creasy cracks him up.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: My country needs justice. Proper
text: justice. Gunning men down in the street
dialog: only feeds the violence. They need to
dialog: be brought to trial. Dealt with
dialog: properly.
dialog: Then people will respect the law. When
dialog: they see it works.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: So you are going to talk me to death.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: You walk out and deal justice. You're
dialog: what I wish I could be.
dialog: (another laugh, then a beat)
dialog: The policemen who kills you, his family
dialog: will have all they want.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Then I hope the one who gets me has got
dialog: lots of kids. What do you want?
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: I want to arrest you for murder! I want
dialog: to shake your hand and reload your gun!
dialog: I want to kill my pride and give you my
dialog: blessing.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys
dialog: were up to something. Are you two
dialog: fucking?
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: No, but I have to admit I thought about

speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Liar. Just tell me who the bank card

dialog: easy, do you?
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I'm not... easy.
text: Manzano reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a folded
text: PIECE OF PAPER and a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE. He hands the
text: bottle out first.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: Percodan. I imagine you need handfuls by
dialog: now.
text: Creasy makes no move to take it. Manzano sighs, sets it
text: down in front of him. Regarding the paper...
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: Account belongs to a woman we think is
text: The Dreamer's girlfriend. Reina Rosas,
text: who is 8 months pregnant.
text: Creasy holds his hand out. Manzano hesitates.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: The plan is the girlfriend will lead you
dialog: to the Boss. You'll lead me, and I'll
dialog: arrest him. Agreed?
text: Creasy doesn't respond. Finally Manzano gives him the
text: paper, a mimeographed mugshot, and address scrawled on it.
text: Creasy stands. As he scoops up the pills. Creasy starts
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: Creasy...
dialog: (Creasy turns)
dialog: I'd have liked to have known you under

speaker_heading: GROUND LEVEL
text: CREASY sits up as a car pulls up, and a MAN gets out.
text: Creasy checks the digital "8x10" even though this face is

text: It's not "The Dreamer." Not as handsome, but there's a
dialog: resemblance.
text: The MAN unlocks the front door, checks the street first
text: and then enters.
text: Creasy regroups mentally and physically. Checks the
text: magazine in his SIG SAUER. Chambers rounds into his
text: shotgun. Looks up and sees a six-year-old on a bicycle
text: approach the front door. A ten-year-old opens the door
text: from inside. The six-year-old struggles to get his

text: Creasy moves. He holds the shotgun against his leg as he

dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 123.
scene_heading: INT. LISA'S BEDROOM
text: Blinds are drawn. Slivers of light illuminate her
text: emotionally drained face.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (silence)
dialog: I don't believe you.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: I want you to get into your car now and
dialog: meet me on the south end of the
dialog: footbridge between Reforma and the
text: freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You're lying. I don't believe you.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Then don't come.
text: He disconnects. He cannot waste his ebbing strength.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AZTECS - SUNSET
text: Darkness has fallen. Few people are on the street as
text: Creasy pulls to the south end of the bridge. He parks...
text: looks around... it's deserted. She's not coming. Checks
text: his watch, turns and walks toward the bridge. The Ramos
text: Mercedes drives up the bridge. Headlights off. Lisa is
text: driving. She exits the car.
text: She runs to catch Creasy.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Creasy... Wait.
speaker_heading: CREASY
dialog: Stay here. If you do something stupid,
dialog: we won't get her back.
text: He climbs the steps of the bridge trying to maintain his
text: dignity through the pain. He can see cars parked on the
dialog: other side.
scene_heading: OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - Creasy's POV
text: Creasy's dreamlike POV (Is it real or a dream) A
text: driver exits a shadowed car and opens the passenger door.
text: A SMALL FIGURE in a hooded sweat shirt and sweat pants
text: exits the car. Confused. Disoriented.
text: CREST OF THE BRIDGE
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 124.
text: Creasy waits. Breathing labored breaths. He sees it all.
scene_heading: OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
text: The driver unties little hands. Removes a blindfold from
text: under the hood. He steps away. Offering no help.
text: The small figure is confused.
text: CREST OF THE BRIDGE
dialog: Creasy calls out:
speaker_heading: CREASY
text: Pinta. Pinta.
text: She turns and looks. It looks remarkably like her even
text: under the hooded sweatshirt. She begins to run. Across
text: the street, up the steps toward Creasy. A screaming
text: train flashes beneath. Car headlights illuminate the
dialog: bridge.
text: Time stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to
dialog: nothing.
text: She runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the
text: bridge. Her hood blows off revealing her full face.
text: It's definitely Pinta. Camera ramps as he jumps into
dialog: Creasy's arms. This is not the little girl we
text: experienced in the beginning of the movie. The
dialog: experience she just endured has been life changing. All
dialog: of a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old
dialog: body.
text: She wraps herself around him. He picks her up. We
text: glimpse a simple tear on his cheek. They talk. But we
dialog: do not hear the words.
text: She notices her mom on the far side of the bridge.
text: Creasy maneuvers her toward Lisa.
text: Before she goes to her mother we hear:
speaker_heading: PINTA
dialog: I love you, Creasy... And you love me,
dialog: right?
text: Creasy nods. The inference is that he will see her in a
dialog: few minutes.
text: We start to hear Linda Ronstadt painfully, quietly on the
text: wind singing "Blue Bayou." He continues to walk across
text: to the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the
text: kidnappers' car.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 125.
text: There's a certain sort of calm of him.
text: He closes the door, he lays his head against the back
text: window. He looks out at PINTA at the other side of the
text: bridge, where she's screams for Creasy. "Blue Bayou"
text: gets LOUDER. Pinta now knows it was a lie. Creasy is
text: not coming back. We're shooting through the glass of the
text: back window. We se Mexico City reflected in the glass.
text: As the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay
text: his head back and close his eyes as the car descends down
text: into a dark tunnel.
text: Pinta can see Creasy's face, eyes slowly closing. He can
text: hear her screams before being enveloped by the night. As
text: "Blue Bayou" continues...
scene_heading: EXT. MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAY
text: Dark spot in the road. Suddenly Police lights, on the
text: roofs of four cars, flash simultaneously in front, in
text: blocking position. The driver turns and looks back
text: wanting to escape. He has a blacked out AFI armored van
text: right on his rear bumper. Nowhere to go.
text: SWAT at his door. He's pulled and proned out onto the
dialog: road.
text: Manzano enters the driver's seat. Reaching back to
text: Creasy. Grabs his hand.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: I'm your chauffeur now, Creasy.
text: Manzano does a U-turn. Heading away. On his portable
dialog: radio.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: All units. Commence the operation.
dialog: Repeat. Commence.
text: He reaches back again.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: Creasy? Creasy?
text: CLOSE UP - Two hands clasp.
text: Creasy's left with Manzano's right. A strong grip. Then
text: no response. Manzano pulls to the curb.
text: Manzano reaches Creasy's wrist. Takes his pulse.
text: Creasy's gone.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 126.
text: Manzano kneels. Still holding Creasy. Unfolds Creasy's
dialog: fingers.
text: CLOSE UP - Pinta's medallion of St. Jude clutched in his
dialog: hand.
text: Manzano punches the seat again again and again.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: Goddamn you.
scene_heading: EXT. GUARDIAN'S CAR - HIGH ANGLE U-TURN
text: Manzano looks at Creasy and makes a decision.
speaker_heading: MANZANO
dialog: (keys mic)
dialog: Hold at the perimeter. Until I enter.
scene_heading: EXT. DANIEL'S COMPOUND
text: Dark, suburban Cuernavaca street. Creasy's car rounds
text: the corner. Security outside the compound motions to
text: open the garage doors. The driver of the car is
text: faceless. Street light reflections across the
dialog: windshield.
text: The car enters the gates. A collection of armed bodies
text: appear in the courtyard curious to see this national
dialog: hero. "Hombre en Fuego."
text: The car stops. Nothing. This beat seems interminable.
text: A hand opens the rear door: His forehead explodes. The
text: driver door opens barely two shots, two more bodies drop.
text: Panic and confusion. Everybody runs for cover. An
text: overhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the
text: courtyard. An armored vehicle rams through the gates.
text: Manzano explodes out of the driver's door in slow motion.
text: He is clearly on a mission. He strides through the
text: mayhem, Creasy's Sig Sauer in one hand, and a .45 auto in
dialog: the other.
text: Manzano's guide to his destination is the 'The Dreamer's'
text: little Jack Russell running back to his master on
dialog: instinct.
text: Manzano moves purposefully. His surrounding environment
text: is Chaplinesque in its chaos. He enters a long walkway
text: to a patio, following the dog. Daniel Sanchez appears at
text: the end of the hall. We ramp him into slow motion. The
text: Mexican version of Gotti. He raises his arms, prepared
text: for the inevitable. The outcome is a given.
dialog: Work in Progress 2/10/03 127.
text: Manzano unloads a magazine into him and we -
