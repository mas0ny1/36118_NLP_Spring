speaker_heading: MIYAGI
text: One point, Hashimoto.
text: Daniel rubs his head, scowling. He sets and punches

speaker_heading: REFEREE

text: Daniel scrambles up and delivers a chop to his neck.

speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Point.
text: The Cobra Kai students cheer louder than the rest of

speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Engarde. Continue.
text: Right off the mark Johnny throws another sweep, fol-
text: lowed by a roundhouse kick to the head. As Daniel's

speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Clash. No.contact. Point.
text: Daniel gets up slowly, in pain. Blood trickles from a

speaker_heading: REFEREE
text: Two two. Match point. Engarde.
dialog: Continue.
text: Johnny sweeps Daniel again, but before he can get his

text: into fighting position.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Engarde. Continue.
text: Johnny charges, coming at Daniel with everything he
text: has. Daniel is almost defenseless, pummeled to the

text: leg, his bad leg, up in the air. He puts his hands out
text: in front of him, setting in a perfect crane stance,
text: His eyes lock with Miyagi's. The old man's mouth
text: creases in the smailest of smiles. Daniel's eyes turn
text: to Johnny. The stance has confused him and the Referee
text: as well, who hesitates for a moment. Daniel remains
text: immobile.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Continue.
text: But Johnny stalls, perplexed, until Kreese's voice
text: shakes him out of his confusion.
speaker_heading: KREESE
dialog: Finish him.
text: Johnny takes a deep breath and lunges. IN SLOW MOTION,
text: Daniel leaps straight up with all his strength, his leg
text: tucked in. His kick catches Johnny in the jaw. Johnny
text: goes down. Daniel lands on his bad leg and collapses
text: as well. The crowd erupts, having never seen such
text: technique. Kreese glares at Johnny, still on the can-
text: vas, and leaves the corner, stalking out of the arena.
text: The Referee calls the fighters to center.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
text: Point. Flying kick. LaRusso.
dialog: Winner.

dialog: Who you calling old man, monkey

text: Kreese throws Johnny aside like a rag doll and rushes
text: Miyagi, lunge punching for his face. At the last mo-
text: ment, Miyagi sidesteps. Kreese's punch goes up to his
text: elbow through a car windshield Miyagi was standing in
text: front of. Ignoring his bloodied nand, Kreese whiris
text: and throws a skip kick. Again Miyagi sidesteps at the
text: last moment, causing Kreese's kick to connect with the
text: side of his own van. The steel bends beneath his
text: power. Enraged, Kreese lunges at Miyagi to kill him.
text: Miyagi does not move. At the last moment, he raises
text: his hand, palm out, and intercepts Kreese's fist.
text: Kreese stops dead in his tracks. The old man's mouth
text: creases in an ironic smile, as he slowly applies pres-
text: sure to Kreese's fist, forcing Kreese down to his
text: knees. ANGLE ON the Cobra Kai students looking out of
text: the van, their eyes wide witn terror and amazement.
text: ANGLE ON Daniel, proud of his teacher. Kreese is
text: brought to his knees, his eyes for the first time,
text: flicker with fear. Miyagi's smile dies. His eyes turn
