speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I am neither Christian...nor
dialog: atheist. I am not Jewish or

dialog: religion is called the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Hang on...let me open these up....
text: We wait as Stephen looks around. He looks at stage hands who
text: are busy working. No one pays any attention to him as he
text: stands there. This isn't awkward for Stephen, THIS IS
speaker_heading: ROUTINE.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay...
dialog: 
text: Lights come up on another podium revealing a debate stage.
text: Stephen continues.

speaker_heading: STEPHEN

speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Thanks. We'll need these monitors
dialog: turned up a bit...it's a big space
dialog: and he wants to be able to hear.
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: You got it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Also we'll need these podiums put
dialog: on a riser as we agreed to in the
dialog: pre-conditions. You're a few
dialog: inches short and it makes it harder
dialog: for the Governor to read his notes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: No I know, we just got those specs
dialog: last night and they're building a

dialog: parchment called the Constitution.
dialog: Meaning I will defend, till my
dialog: dying breath, your right to
dialog: worship, in whatever God or lack
dialog: thereof you believe in, as long as
dialog: it doesn't hurt others. I believe
dialog: we should be judged as a government
dialog: by how we take care of those who
dialog: can't take care of themselves.
dialog: That's my religion. If you feel
dialog: that I'm not religious enough, then
dialog: don't vote for me. If you feel I'm
dialog: not experienced enough or tall
dialog: enough then don't vote for me.
dialog: Because I'm not going to change

speaker_heading: SENATOR PULLMAN
dialog: I just wanted you to say out loud

text: People laugh.

scene_heading: SENATOR PULLMAN (ON MONITOR)
dialog: Well Governor, whoever wins this

dialog: that these questions won't be
dialog: central in a general election then
dialog: you are living in fantasy land. I

speaker_heading: DUFFY

dialog: Six presidentials I've done and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Don't twist my words. What I'm
dialog: saying is that I'm not going to
dialog: promise we'll win. But he's
dialog: decorated by Bush Senior from the
dialog: first Gulf war and protested the
dialog: second. He left his state with a
dialog: balanced budget and the fourth
dialog: highest education rate. The
dialog: Republicans have nobody out there
dialog: that can touch this guy...so for
dialog: this moment, this election, this

dialog: truth is, he's the only one that's
dialog: going to make a difference in
dialog: peoples lives...Even the people

dialog: to win.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IDA
dialog: Or what? The world will fall
dialog: apart? It won't matter...Not one

dialog: called me and left a message to
dialog: call back...that it was important.
dialog: But when I did...you said to forget
dialog: about it. You chose not to tell
dialog: me. Why did you make that choice?
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: I didn't think it was important.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sure you did. But you went because
dialog: you were curious, because you were
dialog: flattered. Because it made you feel
dialog: special to think Duffy wanted to
dialog: speak to you instead of me. Because
dialog: you thought to yourself: maybe I
dialog: can get something out of this.
dialog: Because it made you feel big.
dialog: First campaign I ran tiny little
dialog: race in Kentucky -state senate
dialog: seat. Workin for redneck nobody
dialog: named McGuthrie. Had no money, no
dialog: staff, no fuckin office. Everyone
dialog: thought we didn't stand a chance.
dialog: There's no way we can compete. And
text: about this time, a guy running a
dialog: congressional campaign a few
dialog: districts over gives me a call.
dialog: Says, "I really like what you were
dialog: able to do for poor ole' Sam. But
dialog: let's face it, he's a goner, so why
dialog: don't you come work for me?" What
dialog: do I do? Well Stephen -this is
dialog: where you and I are different. I
dialog: told Sam about the call. And Sam
dialog: says to me, "Paul, you think this
dialog: other's guy's got a shot at
dialog: winning, and he can pay you more
dialog: than anything I can afford, so if
dialog: it's what you feel you need to do,
dialog: then I won't get in your way." So I
dialog: say, "Sam -you took a chance and
dialog: hired me when I was even more of
dialog: nobody than you are, and I'd be
dialog: damned if I'm gonna jump ship just
dialog: because the shit hit the fan."
dialog: We lost the race, but three years

dialog: you're nothing and you have no one.
dialog: And in politics it's the only
dialog: currency that you can count on.
dialog: That's why I'm letting you go. Not
dialog: because you're not good enough. But

speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: As of tomorrow morning there's

dialog: 
scene_heading: GOV. MORRIS
dialog: And why would I do that?
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPHEN
dialog: Because you want to win. Because

scene_heading: GOV. MORRIS
dialog: Okay let's play this out. You're
