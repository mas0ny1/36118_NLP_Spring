text: We hear trickling water. Birds chirping.
text: Then... a sickening THUD. Flesh and bone striking something
text: hard. A SPLASH.
text: A WOMAN SCREAMS. In pain, dazed and incoherent. Water
text: violently overwhelming her breaths...
scene_heading: EXT. WATERING HOLE - MORNING
text: A small waterfall feeds a secluded swimming hole among the
text: Redwoods. Peaceful. Serene.
text: We move over the rocks near the water’s edge until... we
text: come across a thatch of matted, bloody hair.
text: A LIFELESS BODY rests in shallow water near the shore.
text: BLOOD trickles over a WOMAN’S HAND -- a pale strip of skin

text: KELLIE CALDWELL (17) -- confident, smart and centered beyond

text: Almost at the front... she trails the WINNER by a hair.
text: SWISH. The winner breaks through the ribbon. Kellie in close
text: succession. APPLAUSE from the stands.
text: Kellie briefly winces at her loss -- then smiles and waves
text: to the crowd.
dialog: cur TO:
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
dialog: Time for a picture.
text: Kellie holds a SECOND PLACE MEDAL aloft and wraps an arm
text: around JAMES CALDWELL (early 40’s) -- her handsome, proud
dialog: father.
text: Posed at their feet is little sister ABBY (8) -- almost too
text: shy to smile.
dialog: A moment with the happy family... SNAP!
text: TODD (17) -- athletic and kind -- is kept to the sidelines.
text: Forever stuck in the friend zone.
text: Kellie approaches him and he attempts to hug her. She
text: inadvertently RECOILS but saves the moment with a smile.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (nervous laugh)
dialog: Come on, I’m all sweaty.
text: She glances at her family to make sure they didn’t see.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. JAMES’ CAR - NIGHT
text: Kellie and Abby eat celebratory ice cream as James navigates
text: the winding road.
text: James pulls to a stop at a deserted RED LIGHT.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You killed it out there.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I guess. It'd be nice to win at
dialog: some point...
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You got a trophy, didn't you?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: So did two other girls.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Well, I'm allowed to be proud of
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Are you proud of me too?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Of course I am.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: For bucking the trend.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It means that I'm proud of how
dialog: unique you are. You're going to
dialog: grow up to be something special.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (lightly teasing)
dialog: Our special snowflake.
scene_heading: EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT
text: They pull into the driveway of a nice, semi-secluded house

scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: James and the girls are in bed -- Abby in the middle -- the
text: comforter pulled up around them.
text: He grabs the Apple remote.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What'1ll it be?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: It's your turn.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You're the big winner. You decide.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: You never choose. You should get
dialog: some say around here at some point.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (re: Abby)
dialog: Frozen?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: If that's how you want to spend
dialog: your turn. You'll both be asleep so
dialog: quick it won't matter.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That, my young lady, is BS.

scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: James and Abby are fast asleep. The TV illuminates the room.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Kellie rinses dishes -- part of her routine -- and places
text: them in the drying rack.
text: Her eyes linger on the soapy water... bubbles swirl across
dialog: the surface...
text: We PUSH IN on her face... lost in thought...
text: We see the sink get perilously full then OVERFLOW. Water
text: starts to pool at her feet.
text: She snaps out of it, shuts the sink off and grabs a rag.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: She covers James with the blanket, picks Abby up and carries
text: her out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The motion sensors go off as Kellie
text: carries Abby through the room.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yeah, yeah.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie tucks Abby in.
text: It's SHIVERING COLD. She tries to shut the window over the
dialog: bed -- but it's stuck.
text: She PUSHES harder... it comes loose. Almost slamming shut
text: before Kellie catches it again...
text: Kellie glances down at Abby. Thankfully still asleep.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie carefully hangs her newest prize on the large TROPHY
text: SHELF that hangs over her bed.
dialog: Winning trophies, medals and ribbons from throughout the
text: years are arranged chronologically from left to right.
text: All of them are SECOND or THIRD PLACE. Except for the very
dialog: first one -- World's Best Daughter.
text: She gets in bed and pulls up the covers. Satisfied.
text: As soon as she shuts her eyes -- WHISPERS from another room.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie enters to find Abby standing in a corner of the
text: room -- whispering at the wall.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Talking...
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Aren't you a little old for
dialog: imaginary friends?
text: She walks over to Abby, places her hands on her shoulders,
text: and steers her back to bed.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: But I'm not tired anymore.
text: Abby lays in bed, letting Kellie pull the covers over her.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What do you mean? You're not
dialog: scared, are you?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: So why can't you go back to sleep?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Because.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Well, count some sheep or
dialog: something, alright? It'll make my
dialog: job easier.
text: Kellie playfully pinches her cheek and gets up to leave.
text: As she reaches the door she glances back at Abby... somewhat
text: unsettled by all of this.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Eggs in a pan. Bacon sizzling. Toast POPS out of a toaster.
text: Kellie cooks breakfast for three. Been doing it for years.
text: Abby shuffles in wearing COWGIRL BOOTS over her tights.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Nope, inappropriate.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Just one of those society things,
dialog: sis. Go change.
text: James -- wearing a bathrobe -- passes by Abby as he heads to
text: the fridge.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (to Kellie)
dialog: Need any help?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: You don't have time to help. Get
dialog: dressed.
text: James looks down at his bathrobe and nods -- ‘you're right'.
text: He gives her a quick kiss on the forehead.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What would I do without you?
text: James turns and heads back to his room -- leaving Kellie to
text: beam with pride over her successful morning routine.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT MORNING
text: Kellie and Abby eat breakfast. Playful. Not a care in the
dialog: world.
text: James, now dressed, sits between them. Nervous about
text: something -- he takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Nothing... I just... I think it's
dialog: time we talk about --
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Oh no.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Not what. Who. Her.
dialog: (to James)
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Next week.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I like her.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Look, I just want you to be happy.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: But can I just say one thing?
dialog: And it's about what's right for
dialog: you, so you can't get mad.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I reserve the right to get mad, but
dialog: go ahead.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I'd rather see you with someone...
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: And now I am a little mad.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Because you don't get a vote now.
dialog: You get a vote at the beginning,
dialog: between our third and fourth date.
dialog: Not a year and a half later.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I'm sorry I just...
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I've played more than fair. I
dialog: haven't had her over for sleepovers
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: TMI.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: -- that you know of.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Way TMI.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: And now I want her in my life. Our
dialog: lives, actually. You could use some
dialog: help around here. You can just be
dialog: seventeen. Real seventeen, not
dialog: superhero seventeen.
text: Kellie leans back in her chair, annoyed. This is a battle
dialog: she cannot win.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I like superhero seventeen.

scene_heading: EXT. BEER THIRTY - NIGHT
text: The patio of a laid back gastropub. James sits across from
text: ROBIN (29) -- warm, sunny and ever so slightly "off."
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Are you kidding? The girls love
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: He smiles
dialog: Really? I just get this feeling...
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Look, it's a shake-up. But I know
dialog: it'll be a good one.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I don't want them to associate me
dialog: with disruption.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Sometimes disruption is good. I
dialog: need disruption.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I know. But I remember that age.
dialog: Seventeen? She'll have an opinion.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Are you having second thoughts?
dialog: Because the moving deposit's --
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: No! No. I wanna make it work either
dialog: way. I'm just thinking out loud. I
dialog: think I could be a good friend to
dialog: them, you know?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And a good partner to you.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Wow.
text: and takes her hand.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: What a toxic presence you'll be.
scene_heading: INT. UHAUL - DAY
text: TIGHT on Robin. She stands in front of a mirror -- steeling
dialog: herself for something.
dialog: 10.
text: A CRAMPED SPACE containing lots of new-age CERAMIC
text: SCULPTURES and the EQUIPMENT to make them. It looks like
dialog: we're in her apartment...
text: She braces herself in front of the mirror and takes a calm,
text: reassuring breath.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You can do this.
text: She takes a few steps towards the exit...
scene_heading: EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: ... and steps outside. Revealing the UHAUL in the driveway.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Kellie and Abby sit on the floor -- taking in the progress.
text: The family CAT sits between them.
text: The SCULPTURES stick out like a sore thumb in their new
dialog: environment.
text: Robin kneels down to Kellie and Abby’s eyeline.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I just want to thank you girls for
dialog: letting me into your home and your
dialog: hearts. You know I love your dad
dialog: and I’m looking forward to being
dialog: your --
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Sister?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I could be a bit of both. A
dialog: Momster.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Now that has a ring to it.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You're right. We’ll just vibe it
dialog: out.
text: Abby notices James removing a single PICTURE from the wall.
text: He places it in a box and heads to his room. She follows.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
text: James removes a couple of photos from his dresser and adds
text: them to the box.
text: Behind him -- an ELECTRICIAN installs a custom CHANDELIER
text: above the bed. Ceramic and glass. Sculpted by Robin.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It’s a new start, right?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: She doesn’t know you were married?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Of course she does. It’s about
text: making her feel at home. And it’s a
dialog: new start for me too.
text: Abby pries one of the pictures away from him.
dialog: Their family as it was five years ago -- James, Kellie (then
text: 12), Abby (then 3) and LEXY (early 30’s).
text: Lexy was luminous. Big eyes that could find a lie anywhere.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I don’t remember her.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Well, there won’t be a test. You
dialog: were three.
text: James kneels down next to her and looks at the picture.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: She loved you very much.
dialog: (thinks )
dialog: We can put this in your room if you
dialog: want. Would you like that?
text: Abby smiles and nods. Robin enters -- surprised by the
text: chandelier.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Wow. It's up already?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Yep.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Are you sure it... fits?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (lying)
dialog: Yep.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Kellie roams among the boxes and knick-knacks infecting her
text: house. There’s definitely some annoyance simmering up.
scene_heading: INT. CALDWELL HOUSE - FOYER - DAY
text: Robin is unpacking DOZENS OF BOOKS and placing them on the
text: shelves. New age stuff. Some YA fiction. Some poetry and
text: eastern religion selections sprinkled in.
text: Kellie reaches for one called ‘The Replacement Mother: How
dialog: Not To Be a Wicked Stepmom.'
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Good stuff. You make it all the way
dialog: through this one?
text: Robin -- simultaneously gentle and firm -- removes the book
text: from Kellie’s hands. She knows when she’s being made fun of.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Can't blame me for trying.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (backpedaling)
dialog: Well you know Abby's kind of weird.
dialog: If you need any help, you can just
dialog: ask me. There's no book for her.
text: Robin smiles.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Thanks. That would be great.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: James -- draped in a bloody apron -- opens up the grill and
text: inspects a delicious looking tri-tip.
text: A bottle of LIGHTER FLUID at his side.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - LATER
text: Robin plates the food as Abby sits in her chair giggling and
dialog: talking to... no one.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (girlish and formal)
dialog: You'll have to wait. It’s dinner
dialog: time.
text: Kellie throws a look at Robin -- 'see what I mean?'
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: When did this start?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Just the other day.
dialog: (to Abby)
dialog: Abs. What's the deal?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I guess imaginary friends can be
dialog: healthy.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Not as healthy as real ones.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Meh, let her explore.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I'm sorry did you just say "meh?"
dialog: Like, phonetically?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Is that not how you do it?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: No, momster. Internet only. You
dialog: sure you're only twenty-nine?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Just different interests I guess.
text: Robin's smile fades a bit -- Kellie decides to ease up a
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Good for you. I'd love to unplug.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Plus it's probably just the
dialog: generation gap.
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: BLOOD oozes out as James carves the tri-tip.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The “new” Caldwell family settles in for dinner. Kellie and
text: Abby prepare to dig into their steak.
text: Robin swoops in and sprinkles a bunch of SEEDS on their meat
text: right before their forks make contact.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Sesame seeds?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Hemp seeds.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: So what, am I going to be stoned
dialog: all night?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I run track. They test, you know.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: It won’t show up.
dialog: (reconsiders)
dialog: And if it did it’s not like weed
dialog: ever made anyone faster.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It’s okay, Kellie.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Its got Omega 3’s. Your dad loves
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Load me up.
text: Robin sprinkles seeds on his steak as he glares at Kellie --
text: ‘give her a break.’
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Actually it just adds a little
dialog: extra crunch. I like it.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Your brain likes it too.
dialog: 15.
text: James sets his fork down and raises a glass of wine.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I'd just like to take this
dialog: opportunity to welcome Robin into
dialog: our home...
dialog: (looks into Robin's eyes)
dialog: «+. and into our family.
text: Everyone CLINKS their glasses. Kellie and Robin exchange
text: nervous looks as they move their glasses in for a toast...
text: SMASH. Robin's glass shatters in her hand. Everyone at the
text: table startles.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Ouch.
text: Blood drips from Robin's hand.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Robin gets up, heads to the sink and washes off the wound.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Yeah, can you just grab me a paper
dialog: towel?
text: Kellie grabs a roll of paper towels and heads over to Robin.
text: BLOOD trickles down Robin's finger into the water in the
text: sink. Oddly similar to the image in the opening scene.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Yikes.
text: Robin rinses the wound. It's tiny. Kellie presses the paper
text: towel into Robin's palm.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie flosses and brushes her teeth. All of her movements
text: controlled and efficient. Almost comically precise.
text: A NOISE from inside her room. She turns her head...
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie steps from her bathroom into the bedroom.
text: WHOOSH. The window opens. She JUMPS back and lets out a
dialog: gasp.
text: Todd pokes his head through.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Jesus Christ, you scared me.
dialog: (catches her breath)
dialog: You can't be here right now.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: My Dad's here.
text: Todd finishes climbing through the window.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: He's never here on Tuesdays.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Well, now she's here and that's
dialog: changed.
dialog: On Todd -- 'Bummer.'
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: That sucks.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Didn't you see the cars?
text: Todd moves towards her... aiming for seductive, only
text: achieving awkward. She allows a laugh.
text: He leans in for a kiss but she pulls away.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: We’ve talked about this.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Come on, we’ve been dancing around
dialog: it forever. You know we’re more
dialog: than friends.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: How’s that?
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I can tell by the way you look at
dialog: me.
text: He leans in again.
speaker_heading: TODD (cont'd)
dialog: They won’t hear anything. They’re
text: probably going at it right now.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: And you think we should do it in
dialog: sync with them? Ew.
text: She gently pushes him away.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I don’t want to think of him that
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You mean with another woman?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Instead of your mom.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: No. No one wants to think about
dialog: their dad doing anything.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: James and Robin are in fact not going at it. His advances
text: have been thwarted by some worrying on Robin's part.
text: A breeze blows in through the open window.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: The seeds were stupid. I should
dialog: have asked before putting them on.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It's not a big deal. She liked
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Yeah, but it's my first night here
dialog: and I'm messing with her food. Not
dialog: good.
dialog: 18.
text: She shakes her head, lost in the past.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (cont'd)
dialog: I was never cool in school.
dialog: Whenever I tried they just hated me
dialog: more.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Abby's half asleep. The window by her bed is once again
text: open -- allowing a gentle breeze into the room.
text: She shivers a bit. Pulls the blanket tighter. Her feet are
text: still exposed. BRRR.
text: Abby's sheet LIFTS up. At first we think it’s the billowing
text: wind... until it’s PULLED down to cover her feet.
text: A quiet beat.
text: The open window SLAMS shut and the sheets pull TIGHT around
text: Abby -- literally imprisoning her on the bed.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Todd and Kellie hear Abby SCREAM! She heads for the door.
text: Todd follows.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: James and Robin exchange looks and jump out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie and Todd run into Abby’s room. Abby’s curled up ina
text: ball on the bed.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What happened?
text: James enters the room -- worried.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Robin second guesses if she should go into Abby's room or
dialog: not -- 'I don't want to overstep my bounds.'
text: She sees something MOVING out of the corner of her eye.
dialog: 19.
text: She turns her head. ‘What's that?'
text: She looks over to Kellie's room... the door is open... a
text: single trophy falls from Kellie's shelf to the ground.
text: She takes a step towards it... but Abby's crying grows
text: louder.
text: She takes a deep breath and heads into Abby's bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Robin enters and takes her place by James' side.
text: Todd lurks in the background -- almost hoping James won't
dialog: notice him.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Someone slammed the window!
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Sweetie, no one slammed it.
text: James lifts the window. It’s loose. Slides down too easily.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: It fell.
text: Kellie takes a step towards Abby but Robin beats her to
text: it -- she watches as the new addition comforts her sister.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: I'll fix it later. It’s too cold to
dialog: be open anyway.
text: Robin pulls the sheet back onto Abby's bed.
text: James turns and locks eyes with Todd.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: And what's he doing here?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Getting me grounded?
scene_heading: EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kellie ushers Todd out front. They shiver in the night air.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I don’t know what I was thinking. I
dialog: just wanted to help.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Your heart was in the right place.
dialog: Just not your head.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You really going to be grounded?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Please. He’s wrapped around my
dialog: finger.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Pretty soon he'll be wrapped around
dialog: your stepmom's.
text: He pats her on the shoulder and heads to his car.
speaker_heading: KELLIE

dialog: She’s not my stepmom!
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Not yet.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie enters... Abby is nowhere to be seen.
text: WHISPERS from the closet. Kellie opens the door to find Abby
dialog: inside.
text: Abby looks up at her.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I'm not scared anymore.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Good. Yeah, it was just a loud
text: noise.
text: She takes hold of Abby's hand and gently pulls her up and
text: out of the closet.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: You've really gotta cut that out.
text: She guides Abby back into bed.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I'm not tired.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I've heard that before.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: I can lay here for a bit if you
dialog: want.
text: Kellie crawls into bed with Abby. She notices the family
text: photo on her bedside table.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Dad give you that?
text: A beat while Abby considers her next thought.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Why doesn’t daddy talk about how
dialog: she died?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Well, it’s not fun to talk about.
dialog: And mommy wasn’t... it wasn’t a
dialog: good time for daddy and mommy.
dialog: (switches gears)
dialog: All you need to know is that she
dialog: was amazing and she loved you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Lay on your front and I’1l show you
dialog: how she used to put me to sleep.
text: Abby lays on her stomach. Kellie places two fingers at the
text: small of her back and gently walks them up her spine.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (singing)
text: The itsy-bitsy spider went up the
dialog: water spout...
text: She quickly trails her fingers away from Abby’s neck.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Down came the rain and washed the
text: spider out. Out came the sun and
dialog: dried up all the rain.
text: She walks her fingers back up.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: And the itsy-bitsy spider climbed
text: up the spout again.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Again.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: If you’re anything like I was
dialog: this'll take a while.
dialog: (sings)
text: The itsy-bitsy spider went up the
dialog: water spout...
text: We pan over from the bed to Abby's door... slightly open. An
text: EYE watches them from outside.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Robin -- in her nightgown -- watches from the darkness of
text: the hallway.
dialog: Maybe jealous... maybe just wanting to know how to take care
dialog: of Abby...
text: After a beat she turns and heads back to her bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Robin soaks in the tub -- a candle lit on the edge of the --
text: basin -- trying to unwind.
text: A KNOCK on the door. She startles.
speaker_heading: JAMES (0.C.)
dialog: Everything okay in there?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Yep! Just trying to unwind.
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: And hoping this gets easier.
speaker_heading: TAP.
text: A water drop falls from the shower head above and lands on
text: her forehead.
speaker_heading: TAP.
text: Robin glances up at the shower head -- annoyed. Another
text: water drop forms then... TAP.
text: The candle FLICKERS as though wind blows over it. Robin
text: looks around... all the windows are closed.
text: TAP. TAP. Robin looks over to THE SINK -- which is now
dialog: dripping. 'Weird.'
dialog: 23.
text: She gets out of the tub, puts on her bathrobe and heads to
text: the sink. She twists the faucet OFF.
text: TAP. A DROP of water strikes her forehead. She looks up...
text: .».. and sees a THIN LINE OF WATER stretching across the
text: ceiling from the shower -- stopping right over her head.
speaker_heading: TAP.
text: She grabs a towel and blots the water from the ceiling.
text: She looks to the candle... which flickers again before going
text: out completely.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Egg whites and spinach in a pan. Turkey bacon in the
text: microwave. Spelt toast POPS out of the toaster.
text: A healthier, more hippy-ish version of the breakfast we saw
dialog: earlier.
text: Kellie practically skips in only to stop in her tracks as
text: she discovers Robin has taken over her duties.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Breakfast?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: You know, you don't have to do
dialog: this. I normally get it. Part of my
dialog: routine.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Oh no, you've got school. You
dialog: probably have to cram for tests or
dialog: whatever. It'll be my routine.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I really think Abby's used to --
text: Abby -- happily munching away -- looks up from her plate.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: This is good!
text: Kellie sighs, grabs a plate and takes her seat.
text: DING! A laptop on the table chimes. Robin runs over to it
text: and clasps her hands excitedly.
dialog: 24.
text: ONSCREEN -- Robin’s Etsy page. Her sculptures actually sell
dialog: like crazy.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Sold another one!
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Of those things?
text: Kellie stifles a laugh.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (whispers to Abby)
dialog: Be nice.
text: Robin grabs a plate of food and joins them at the table.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (to Abby)
dialog: You get back to sleep okay after
dialog: your little adventure?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Yeah. The window didn't fall like
dialog: dad said, though.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Oh no?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I was cold so she shut it.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Who shut it?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I don't think --
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I think it was Mom.
text: The air is sucked out of the room.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Abby, it wasn't Mom okay? Mom's not
dialog: here anymore.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Oh, I’m sure she’s here in some
dialog: way.
text: Robin reaches out with both arms, grabs Kellie and Abby by
text: the hands, and closes her eyes.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (cont'd)
dialog: (like she's acknowledging
dialog: a presence)
dialog: Lexy, it’s an honor to be in your
dialog: home with your two beautiful girls.
text: Kellie pulls her hands away.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Are you trying to talk to a ghost?
dialog: Because ghosts are scary. Even if
dialog: they're Mom.
dialog: (to Abby)
dialog: Which it's not.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Of course not. I was thinking more
dialog: along the lines of a therapeutic --
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Not talking to walls is
dialog: therapeutic.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (to Abby)
dialog: What makes you think it's her? Why
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: She’s always been here. I just
text: wasn’t looking for her.
text: sharp in his suit.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: See? Now it's in her head.
text: James enters the kitchen -- already dressed and looking
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (to Robin)
speaker_heading: ON KELLIE
dialog: obscuring
dialog: Will you look at this? I'm running
dialog: on time for once.
text: -- James gives Robin a quick kiss on the forehead,
text: Kellie's face from the frame as he does so.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Kellie’s SKIPPING ROPE. Always training. James KNOCKS on the
text: side of her open door.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Hey kiddo.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Hey pops.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Listen, I need you to do me a
dialog: solid.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: How would you feel about
dialog: integrating Robin a little more?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: She’s been here 24 hours and I’m
dialog: two for two on meals.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I just want her to feel welcome,
dialog: you know?
text: He gestures to one of Robin's sculptures in the hallway --
text: still wrapped in plastic from the move.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: And you could stand to do a little
dialog: decorating.
text: Her face drops.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Did she ask you to do this?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No. And it'll play a lot better if
dialog: it's your idea.
scene_heading: EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - DAY
text: A GARAGE SALE.
text: Kellie, Abby and James man a table in the front yard. Boxes
text: and knick-knacks litter the table. An old VCR, a sculpture
text: of Robin's, a pair of old Rollerblades.
dialog: No customers so far...
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Why are we selling our stuff?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Well, it's not just our stuff. It's
dialog: her stuff too. We're both getting
dialog: rid of what we don't need so
dialog: everything fits together.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (rolls her eyes)
dialog: Yeah, her stuff meshes.
text: A car pulls up.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I didn't know Grandpa was coming.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I don't want to get rid of anything
dialog: he'd want.
text: The car door opens and BERNARD (65) -- a swaggering, portly
text: curmudgeon -- steps outside.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Hey there... fam.
speaker_heading: JAMES KELLIE
dialog: Hi, Bernard. Hi, Bernard.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Hi, Grandpa!
text: Bernard bends down and gives Abby a hug.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: How's my favorite grandkid?
text: (winks up at Kellie)
dialog: Just kidding, it's a tie.
text: Robin emerges carrying a big box -- she heads over to the
text: table and sets it down.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Hi! I'm Robin!
text: James stands up -- flustered.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Hey there, I'm Bernard.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I can't believe you guys haven't
dialog: met. Robin, Bernard's my father in
dialog: law.
dialog: 28.
text: Robin does the math in her head -- 'oh.'
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: It's okay, darlin'. Life goes on.
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: Bernard goes off to play with Abby while Robin starts
text: unpacking the box.
text: She pulls out a few DVD's and some books. Then -- she slowly
text: pulls out an OLD NECKLACE -- somehow both ornate and
dialog: tasteful.
text: Robin looks at it curiously. Kellie's eyes widen with anger.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What are you doing? We can't sell
dialog: that!
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. It didn't seem like
dialog: your style.
text: Kellie takes the necklace from her.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: This was my Mom's.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Oh, Kellie. You know I would
dialog: never --
speaker_heading: BERNARD
text: Everyone simmer down.
text: Bernard wheezes a bit... pulls out an INHALER and takes a
text: puff as he heads over to take a look.
speaker_heading: BERNARD (cont'd)
dialog: I don’t remember that one.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Turquoise is a healing stone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It also keeps people from
dialog: overreacting.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Why don't you put it on?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Oh no, I don't think --
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Come on. If you want it you should
dialog: wear it.
text: Kellie carefully drapes the necklace over her head... it
text: rests perfectly around her neck.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: It looks beautiful on you, Kellie.
text: Robin hands the box she took the necklace from over to
dialog: Kellie.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (cont'd)
dialog: You should really be the one to go
dialog: through this.
text: Bernard pats Robin on the back and steers her towards the
text: table full of knick-knacks.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Now let's take a look at the rest
dialog: of this garbage.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Kellie shuts the door behind her.
text: She quickly pulls off the necklace.... places it in her
text: dresser drawer... and closes it.
scene_heading: INT. SCOTTS VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY
text: A lethargic SCIENCE TEACHER lectures. Kellie sits in front
dialog: of all the other STUDENTS.
scene_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
dialog: And what does the law of
dialog: conservation of energy state?
text: An OVEREAGER STUDENT shoots her hand up. The Science Teacher
text: nods in her direction.
scene_heading: OVEREAGER STUDENT
dialog: That energy can neither be created
dialog: or destroyed.
text: Kellie just stares ahead. Lost in thought.
scene_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
dialog: Very good. What can energy do under
dialog: this law?
dialog: 30.
text: Overeager Student shoots her hand up again.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (blurts out)
dialog: Change form.
scene_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
dialog: That's correct.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Although we still raise our hands
dialog: around here.
text: BZZZ. She reaches into her bag and grabs her cell phone.
text: ON PHONE -- 3 MISSED CALLS and VOICEMAILS from ‘Abby
dialog: School.’
text: Kellie raises her hand.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I'm sorry, can I be excused?
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTTS VALLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
text: Kellie pulls into the elementary school parking lot. She
text: jumps out of her car and RUSHES inside.
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR (0.S. FILTER)
dialog: Hi Kellie, we’re having a bit of a
dialog: problem with Abby. We were actually
dialog: wondering if you could come get

scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - FRONT OFFICE - DAY
text: Kellie approaches a SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR at her desk.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Hi, you guys called. I'm here to
dialog: get Abby.
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: She's not here.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
text: Her mom picked her up.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Okay, her mom is dead. You know
dialog: that, right?
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: (whoops )
dialog: I'm so sorry. Not her mom. That
dialog: pretty young lady. Your father
dialog: added her to the list. She was
dialog: upsetting the other kids...
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: wh , annoyed)
dialog: Ly?
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: She told them she... could talk to
text: the dead. The kids got in her face.
dialog: Made fun of her.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie gets into her car -- whips out her phone and dials
dialog: ‘Dad.’
text: It goes to voicemail.
speaker_heading: JAMES (0.S. FILTER)
dialog: You’ve reached James. I’m over
dialog: forty, so feel free to leave a
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: You gave Robin Mom privileges?
dialog: Isn’t that a little fast?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: At least someone’s still doing your
dialog: job for you.
text: She angrily hangs up.
scene_heading: EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie pulls into the driveway.
scene_heading: INT. CALDWELL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Robin and Abby walk down the hall towards her room.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You know the kids at my school
dialog: picked on me too.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: They did?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Big time. I was a little bit
dialog: different like you are.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: How?
text: Robin takes a long inhale, smiles and kneels down to her.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Us weird ones, we've got to stick
dialog: together.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Come on, I've got a surprise for
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Abby bounds into her room with Robin following. On her bed
text: is a WOODEN BOX. She slowly opens it...
text: INSIDE -- PICTURES of Lexy and Abby together. A LOCK OF
speaker_heading: HAIR.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I found this stuff during the
dialog: garage sale. I figure if Kellie
dialog: gets the necklace... I wanted to
dialog: save something for you.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (holding the box)
dialog: You made this for me?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I think it’s important for you to
dialog: feel a connection with her. And to
dialog: know that I’m here for you, not to
dialog: take her place.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie quietly sneaks up on Abby's room... peeks through the
text: open door.
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Abby looks to the closet tentatively... almost as though
dialog: she's seeking permission from someone we can't see.
text: She nods to whatever she's looking at and then proceeds to
dialog: give Robin a hug.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Awww. I'm fitting in already?
text: Kellie enters -- her eyes lock on the box.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Is that my mom's stuff?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I thought --
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Can you ask before doing things
dialog: like this please? She's already
text: fixated.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Your dad and I discussed it.
text: Kellie sighs... she'll let this one go. She sits on the bed
text: next to Abby.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: She can have it. It's just weird to
dialog: see this stuff again. I miss her.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Of course you do.
text: Kellie pulls the photo out of the box and gazes at it.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: She was great.
dialog: (ill-timed glance at Robin)
dialog: One of a kind.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: James and Robin are post-coital in bed.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What you did for Abby today was
dialog: really sweet.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I just don't want her to think I'm
dialog: trying to replace this perfect mom.
dialog: (almost in tears)
dialog: I already feel like I'm trying to
dialog: replace a perfect wife.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Who says you're not perfect?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Part of you has to wish she was
dialog: still here.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Of course. I loved her very much.
dialog: But she's not here. You are. And
dialog: you're not second fiddle. She was
dialog: my first choice then, but you're my
dialog: first choice now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Besides, it's not like things were
text: perfect at the end.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: How?
text: James takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (cont'd)
dialog: If you don't want to talk about
dialog: it --
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No, it's okay. She was just
dialog: distant, you know? Like something
text: was sucking the joy out of her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I mean, she wasn't wearing her ring
dialog: when she died.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I'm sorry, James.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It's not all her fault, you know? I
dialog: could have done a better job. I was
dialog: checked out, not involved enough
dialog: with the kids...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So now I just wonder. About
dialog: everything.
text: He rolls on his side to face her.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: Promise me something, okay?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Keep me in the loop. Don't let me
dialog: wonder.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie stares at the moon outside her window. Something
text: catches her attention...
text: A HORRIFYING vision in the corner. Moonlight bears down on
text: it like an evil, black tree growing out of the floor.
text: She flicks on the lights... it’s just that sculpture of
dialog: Robin's.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Great.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Abby lays on her stomach, singing softly to herself.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (singing)
text: The itsy-bitsy spider went up the
dialog: water spout...
text: In the background -- her bedroom door slowly CLOSES.
speaker_heading: ABBY (cont'd)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Down came the rain and washed the
dialog: spider out... out came the sun and
dialog: dried up all the rain...
text: A breeze from nowhere waffles the sheets.
speaker_heading: ABBY (cont'd)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: ...and the itsy-bitsy spider
text: climbed up the spout again.
text: Inching closer to sleep, she starts the song again.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: ABBY (cont'd)
dialog: (singing)
text: The itsy-bitsy spider climbed up
dialog: the water spout...
text: INVISIBLE FINGERS walk up her back as she sings along,
text: pressing into her pajamas.
speaker_heading: ABBY (cont'd)
dialog: Kellie I didn’t know--
text: She turns over. No one’s there. She bolts upright in bed and
text: looks around.
speaker_heading: ABBY (cont'd)
dialog: Kellie?
text: No one's there. A completely empty room. Abby glances at the
text: box of Lexy's on her nightstand.
speaker_heading: ABBY (cont'd)
dialog: Mommy ?
text: Her eyes lock on something offscreen.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: We slowly pull away from Abby’s door and into the hallway.
text: As we depart... we hear her TALKING.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: ANGLE -- Robin’s sculpture. Still downright horrifying in
text: the moonlight.
text: Kellie grabs a blanket and tosses it over the sculpture.
text: Then -- a KNOCKING sound. She scans the room, trying to
dialog: place it...
text: ...her dresser drawer shakes. Or did she imagine it?
text: She heads to her dresser and opens the drawer.
dialog: The necklace.
text: She pulls it out and holds it. Fingers the interlocking
dialog: rivets... concerned...
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The entry/exit alert from the motion
dialog: detector system.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie investigates -- absentmindedly gripping the necklace.
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
text: Something stirs at the dark end of the room. She approaches
text: slowly... leans down to look...
text: THE CAT JUMPS OUT.
text: She jumps back -- dropping the necklace.
text: At that exact moment a stack of magazines TOPPLES off a
text: nearby table. They fall in the same direction as the
dialog: necklace.
text: Kellie glances back and forth from the necklace on to the
text: pile of magazines on the floor.
text: She picks up the necklace -- the curtains across the room
text: SWAY UP AND DOWN -- echoing the motion of the necklace as
text: she lifts it...
text: She backs away... frightened...
text: Then... the cat scurries across the room.
text: WHAM! She bumps into James -- scaring the shit out of both
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I was hoping that was you sneaking
dialog: in or something.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I’m grounded, remember?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (give me a break)
dialog: You're never really grounded.
text: James and Kellie check the front door. Locked. He hits a
text: button. The alarm stops.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
text: Motion detector. Abby’s in her
dialog: room, right?
text: Kellie nods.
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! It goes off again. ‘What the fuck?’
dialog: 38.
text: Then... the cat SCURRIES into the room. James sighs and
text: flicks the alarm off.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (wary)
dialog: He never sets this off.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Yeah, but you've been feeding him
dialog: too much.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're not starting to believe this
dialog: ghost stuff, are you?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I...
dialog: (covering)
dialog: ... of course not.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Exactly. Team cat.
text: James yawns and pats Kellie on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: Going back to bed, kiddo. You
dialog: should too.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
text: In a second.
text: She scoops the cat up and heads into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie -- the cat still cradled in one arm -- walks slowly.
text: She holds out the necklace and sways it front of her.
dialog: Nothing.
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The hallway detector BEHIND her.
text: A chill comes over her -- she looks at the cat cradled
dialog: against her.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Why couldn’t it be you?
text: She lets the cat fall to the floor and follows as it
text: scurries out of the room.
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The cat runs up to Kellie's door -- PURRING and rubbing
text: against it. A friendly reception for whatever's inside...
text: Kellie slowly approaches her room and reaches for the door.
text: She PULLS her hand away -- it's dripping. The handle is WET.
text: She opens her door slowly...
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie scans her room... empty. Still.
text: She glances to the sculpture ... the blanket she threw over
text: it billows. 'Is something under there?'
text: Her eyes move to the trophy shelf. One small trophy on the
text: end is turned askance. 'Weird.'
text: She slowly stalks toward the display, eyes peeled for
dialog: anything unusual, and fixes it.
text: Her closet door is open. ‘Fuck.’ She heads over to close it.
text: PLOP. She spins around to see a trophy on the carpet.
text: She turns back to the closet -- the door SLAMS shut.
text: PLOP. Kellie spins around again. Another trophy on the
dialog: floor.
text: Kellie doesn’t know what to make of it.
text: They start falling... one by one... PLOP. PLOP. PLOP.
text: Kellie moves to the shelf... then peers down at her hand --
text: the necklace TIGHTENS around her palm. Painfully... like a
dialog: noose.
text: BAM! The SHELF TOPPLES over -- sending the trophies and
text: their sharp metal edges down almost all over her.
text: She STUMBLES BACK and FALLS.
text: The necklace slips free, bounces off the floor, slipping
text: under the black recesses of her dresser.
text: She catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror -- SOMETHING
text: is behind her.
text: Undefined, dark... almost wraith-like.
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
text: Terrified, she peers into the mirror...
speaker_heading: ABBY (0.C.)
dialog: I told you. It's Mom.
text: Kellie SCREAMS and spins around. Abby stands in the doorway.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: No. Mom wouldn't do this. Mom
dialog: wouldn't make us feel like this!
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: She did Itsy-Bitsy.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (whispers, scared)
dialog: It was watching us...
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Sometimes she whispers things...
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What does she say? Has she said
dialog: anything about us?
dialog: Abby thinks...
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: She asked about the necklace.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Abby, I know I made a big deal
dialog: about that necklace, but I was just
dialog: mad at Robin. I was being a jerk.
dialog: Mom hated that thing. I don’t know
dialog: who gave it to her and I never saw
dialog: her wear it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I need you not to talk to this
dialog: thing.

dialog: Why? I like her.
text: Kellie grabs Abby by the shoulders.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Abby, I’m your sister. I love you.
dialog: I would never lie to you. You've
dialog: got to trust me. Do you trust me?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: ...yes.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Whatever this is... stay away from
dialog: it.
text: James and Robin arrive to investigate the racket.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (taking in the mess)
dialog: What the hell happened?
text: Kellie bends down and grabs the WORLDS BEST DAUGHTER trophy
text: off the floor.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Robin, can you take Abby back to
dialog: her room please?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (re: the mess)
dialog: But let me help you-
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Please, Robin. Abby, remember what
dialog: I said.
text: Robin steers Abby into the hall. James pulls Kellie aside.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Kellie, are you trying to...
dialog: sabotage this?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Sabotage what?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You know... me and Robin.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (re: the destroyed room)
dialog: You think I did this? This thing is
dialog: real.
dialog: (thinks )
dialog: Maybe whatever was “bothering” Mom
text: is now bothering Abby too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: We both know Mom was acting weird
text: at the end.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That’s not what happened. She was
dialog: depressed.
text: James gently takes the WORLD'S BEST DAUGHTER trophy from her
text: and places it back on the shelf.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: You don’t believe me do you?
text: James surveys the toppled shelf and the trophies strewn
text: throughout the room -- not knowing what to think.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie examines herself in the mirror... there are RED WELTS
text: on her hand where the necklace tightened around it.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie bends down on her hands and knees to peer into the
text: darkness under the dresser.
text: She reaches in... feels around... grappling in the
text: darkness... and finally pulls out the necklace.
text: She studies it... mesmerized. She pulls the blanket off the
text: sculpture, wraps herself up in it and climbs into bed.
text: She gazes up at the necklace for a moment before hiding it
text: under her pillow.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
text: The family eats -- but everything feels stilted. A nervous
text: energy in the air. The only person not tense is Abby...
text: happily munching away at her breakfast.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Maybe it's good that Mom's back.
text: Kellie glares at James -- 'see?'
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Abby, we talked about this.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (to Abby)
dialog: For right now let's just focus on
dialog: what we can see.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: But I do see her.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: You're seeing what it wants you to
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Kellie, you're feeling a lot of
dialog: upheaval right now and this is the
text: anxiety manifesting itself.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Maybe there is something here,
dialog: Robin. I honestly don't know.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I just think everyone's on edge and
dialog: reading into the wrong things.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What about my room?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Maybe the shelf couldn't handle the
dialog: weight.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: A testament to your hard work.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Do those Dr. Spock books tell you
dialog: to ignore all danger to your
dialog: family?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Enough. Whatever's going on, we're
dialog: still a family. Let's act like it,
dialog: okay?
text: Kellie grabs her backpack.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Totally.
text: James looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Shoot, we've gotta go too.
text: James scoops Abby out of her seat and heads out of the
dialog: kitchen.
text: Robin is left alone.
dialog: 44,
text: She sighs -- 'what a mess' -- and takes another bite of food
text: and washes it down with some water.
text: ... GULP. Something's caught in her throat -- threatening
text: her gag reflex.
text: She pulls the glass away and notices a SINGLE STRAND OF HAIR
text: hanging from her mouth.
text: Unable to swallow -- she opens her mouth and PULLS the
text: strand out... finally excavating a CLUMP OF MATTED HAIR.
text: Terrified and disgusted -- she closes her eyes and quickly
text: stands up.
text: ... when she opens her eyes she's holding just the single
dialog: strand again.
text: She looks around... creeped out... 'am I going crazy?'

dialog: her.
dialog: She’s just told him everything.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You really think this thing wants
dialog: to hurt you?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: TODD (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, come on.
dialog: (off Kellie's look)
dialog: I didn’t mean it like that. If it’s
dialog: something you're really feeling...
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I don’t need sensitive Todd. I need
dialog: practical Todd.
text: Todd raises his hand.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: So you don’t believe me either?
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I thought you wanted practical
dialog: Todd.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Actually, I want patient Todd.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Maybe you need a change of scenery.
dialog: At least next year we'll be a
text: thousand miles away.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Actually... I was thinking of
dialog: staying here.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: What do you mean? We're going to
dialog: Boulder.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Not if I go to college in the city.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Why would you stay?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: My family needs me, okay?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: They'll be fine. They've got Robin

speaker_heading: TODD (cont'd)
dialog: Got it. Patient Todd.
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTTS VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - TRACK - DAY
dialog: Track practice.
text: Kellie is at the starting line. Up against two students from
text: last time and TWO NEW RUNNERS from the same school.
text: TIGHT ON KELLIE -- her focus is eerily razor sharp. More
dialog: determined than ever.
text: cu - The starter gun fires.
text: Kellie starts ahead and stays there -- 'Yes! She's finally
dialog: gonna win!’
dialog: 46.
text: She gives a quick glance to the STANDS -- and sees A FIGURE
text: standing at the top of the bench. ARMS OUTSTRETCHED. COVERED
text: BY A RIPPED BODY BAG. DRIPPING WET.
text: Kellie STUMBLES and CRASHES down into the track. Everyone
text: crosses the finish line without her.
text: She looks back up at the stands -- they're empty.
scene_heading: INT. SCOTTS VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Kellie’s in class. Tired. Distracted. BLOOD seeps through
text: the bandage on her leg.
scene_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
dialog: And so what does Newton’s first law
dialog: tell us?
text: No one raises their hand. The teacher looks to Kellie...
text: she’s off in another world.
speaker_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER (cont'd)
dialog: Ms. Caldwell?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (snaps out of it)
dialog: Yeah?
scene_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
dialog: Newton's first law.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I... I’m sorry.
text: He pats her on the shoulder as he walks down the aisle.
scene_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
dialog: An object that is at rest will stay
dialog: at rest until an external force
dialog: acts upon it. And --
text: Kellie absentmindedly mouths along with the next part...
speaker_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER (cont'd)
text: An object in motion will not stop
text: until an external force acts upon
dialog: it.
text: She glances at her textbook -- a DIAGRAM displaying these
text: principles. An object at rest. An object in motion. An
text: external force. An object stopping.
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
text: Robin is on her knees PLANTING SEEDS in the dirt near the
text: deck, a glass of wine at her side.
speaker_heading: BERNARD (0.C.)
dialog: Got a second?
text: Robin startles. Bernard enters the yard from the side.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Hey, Bernard. What's up?
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: I wanted to clear the air about
dialog: something since it seems like we're
dialog: going to be seeing more of each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Uh... Sure.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: You've probably guessed that I've
dialog: steered clear of meeting you these
dialog: past few years.
text: Robin wipes her hands on her jeans.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Yeah, I thought that might be the
dialog: case.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Well, I came to apologize. It's
dialog: just... at the time I didn’t know
dialog: what to think of it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Considering you knew her.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: James and I got together three
text: years after the funeral, Bernard.
dialog: It's a circle of friends. Things
dialog: happen.
text: Bernard nods -- looks off in the distance.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: I came to explain, not accuse. I'm
dialog: fine with it now. Like I said, life
dialog: goes on. I was just being a Dad.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Well, I was as surprised as anyone
dialog: he asked me out. She’s not an easy
dialog: act to follow.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Have you told the girls?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: James and I don't think it's a good
dialog: idea right now. It's such an uphill
dialog: battle already.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Kellie?
text: Robin bends back down and starts digging with her trowel --
text: like she’s angry.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Yep.
text: Bernard pulls out his inhaler... takes a puff.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: She's a handful, alright. Likes to
dialog: be in charge, doesn't she? You
dialog: gotta fight or roll over with her.
text: Robin pauses on her response as she drops a handful of seeds
text: into the soil.
dialog: Then...
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Don't worry, I'm not going
dialog: anywhere.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: (chuckles )
dialog: Good luck with that. And call me if
dialog: you need anything. Lord knows James
dialog: never does.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Anytime.
text: Bernard makes his way back around the side of the yard.
text: Robin pulls out the hose to water the seeds -- notices a
text: LEAK where the tube screws into the water spout.
text: She grabs the spout handle to adjust it -- SPSHHH! It SPRAYS
text: her with water.
dialog: 49.
text: She steps back -- 'great.'
scene_heading: EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - DAY
text: Kellie's car pulls into the driveway as Bernard's pulls out.
text: Her eyes trail after him -- 'what's he doing here?
scene_heading: INT. CALDWELL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Kellie arrives home and catches a glimpse of Robin through
text: the back windows.
text: Her eyes linger on Robin -- DRENCHED with water... MATTED
dialog: hair...
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Kellie closes the door behind her, opens the drawer and
text: pulls out the necklace.
text: She studies it, nervous -- ‘what the fuck am I thinking?’
scene_heading: EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kellie's room is the only one with the lights on. Then...
text: they go out.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Kellie scouts around. Peering in everyone’s bedroom --
text: they’re all asleep.
text: She opens a closet and pulls down a SHOEBOX.
text: CU ON SHOEBOX -- Christmas ornaments and tchotchkes.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kellie places a tiny SILVER BELL on her doorknob.
text: She moves down the hall towards the master bedroom and
text: places a silver bell on that doorknob as well.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie stands on a chair and pulls one of the MOTION
text: DETECTOR SENSORS down. Battery powered. No wires.
dialog: 50.
text: She repeats this process in the remaining three corners of
text: the room collecting four sensors total.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Kellie places a chair in the center of the room then plants
text: the sensors around it in a circle. A clear enclosed area of
dialog: protection and visibility.
text: She activates the sensors -- BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! -- and sits
text: in the chair.
text: A text arrives on her phone from Todd -- ‘Good luck tonight.
dialog: I believe you.’ Then -- ‘Sure you don’t want company? Maybe
dialog: the ghost can watch us “leave the friend zone.”'
text: She sighs, tucks the phone in her pocket without answering,
text: then pulls out the necklace and cradles it in her hand.
text: Watches. Waits.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Come on, come on.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER
text: PLUNK. The necklace hits the floor. Kellie wakes from an
dialog: accidental nap.
text: Her eyes dart around...
text: All the cabinets are wide open. 'Weird.'
text: She closes them... unnerved... and thinks for a beat.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIO - NIGHT
text: Kellie quietly exits to the patio and closes the door. She
text: shivers from the cool night air.
text: She pulls out her phone. A text from Todd. ‘Still up?’ She
text: DIALS and he picks up immediately.
speaker_heading: TODD (0.S. FILTER)
dialog: So. Did it show up again?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Nothing that’1l convince them
dialog: they’re in danger.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: TODD (0.S. FILTER)
dialog: What made it appear last time?
text: This sparks a thought. Kellie quickly ends the call.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Let me call you back.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Kellie pulls some cat treats out of one of the open
dialog: cabinets...
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Here, kitty kitty.
text: The cat SCURRIES in -- BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! -- and jumps into
text: her lap.
text: The cat warily accepts the treat then turns to leave. Kellie
text: GRABS hold of it. It squirms in her lap, trying to get free.
text: The struggle grows. Kellie holds.
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Something just entered the kitchen!
text: The cat leaps out of her lap with a HISS.
text: Kellie JUMPS TO HER FEET.
text: The cat PURRS at something in the corner of the room.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Leave us alone!
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! It just moved to the other side. Kellie
text: spins in its direction. Still nothing there.
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Kellie spins again behind her. The thing
text: is moving back and forth. She’s scared.
text: Defiant, Kellie lifts the necklace. Hesitant, a little
dialog: scared of it.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Here goes nothing.
text: Kellie lights a cigarette lighter and moves the FLAME to a
text: section of the necklace.
dialog: 52.
text: SUDDENLY there is an ungodly SHRIEK -- a wraith-like black
text: specter appears in front of her.
text: Kellie gapes at the sight.
text: She WINCES in pain -- her hand is burning too -- as if the
text: necklace is resisting with its own unnatural heat.
text: She turns to face the living room -- DROPPING the lighter
dialog: and necklace.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: WHAM. Something invisible hits the floor. In pain.
text: We see FINGER MARKS -- five on each hand -- appear in the
text: carpet. They streak down into long lines... like this thing
text: is trying to crawl away in agony.
text: Kellie grabs the necklace and -- with two hands -- pulls
text: with all her might. The chain SNAPS in two.
text: The specter suddenly is sent HURLING forward -- freed by the
text: breaking of the chain... but still in agony.
text: Kellie DUCKS as it passes overhead and hugs the ground.
text: The invisible force SLAMS into the BOOKSHELF causing it to
text: wobble and fall forward -- in a split second shot we see the
text: cat standing inescapably in its path.
text: The cat -- hair puffed -- stares at Kellie just before the
text: shelf crashes down upon it.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING
text: Kellie digs a tiny GRAVE -- right where Robin planted her
text: seeds earlier. Tiny sprouted SEEDLINGS speck the dirt.
text: A PAW pokes out of the trash bag next to her.
text: James stands behind Kellie -- oblivious that she's digging
dialog: up Robin's stuff.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: How do we explain this to Abby?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: He ran away? We sent him to a farm
dialog: where he can play?
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I don’t like it. What were you
dialog: doing up so late? I don’t even
dialog: understand how this happened.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I told you how it happened!
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Your mother loved that cat.
text: Kellie stops digging, stands, faces him.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
text: Dad. Whatever Abby's talking to is
dialog: real. It's here. It did this. And
dialog: it is not Mom. It's pretending to
dialog: be her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It wants something from Abby. I
dialog: don't know... to peel her away from
dialog: us.
text: James gently pries the trowel out of her hand, sticks it in
text: the ground, wraps an arm around her and starts walking.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We need to talk.
text: Kellie looks up at him -- ‘uh oh.'
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: Look, I'm open to the idea that
dialog: there's something here. Whether
dialog: it's your mom or --
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Does part of you wish it was her?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I'd have a few questions I guess.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: People lose rings all the time.
dialog: Todd's dad lost his three times. It
dialog: doesn't mean she was --
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: How'd you know about that?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I heard you talking about the
dialog: police report.
dialog: She stops
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: The point is, it's not your job to
dialog: fix this. We'll figure it out
dialog: together. In a way that doesn't
text: send Robin running for the hills.
dialog: She's only been here a few days,
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Funny. Same timeline as this whole
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You don't know her like I do, okay?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You've always been protective of
dialog: your sister and me. After your mom
dialog: died, you took on more than any
dialog: twelve year old should.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: It's fine.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No, it's not. It wasn't fine. And
dialog: now I'm grabbing the wheel.
dialog: walking.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You're wired to protect us. That’s
dialog: my fault. I should have been
dialog: stronger. But now it’s okay to just
dialog: be you. Alright?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: So I'm being demoted.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No. You're free. We don’t need to
dialog: be protected.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Well what are you going to do?
dialog: About this?
text: James smiles halfheartedly and shakes his head as they turn
text: around and head back.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I don't know. We'll figure
dialog: something out.
text: Kellie looks down as they walk along -- 'no you won't.'
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Robin digs through boxes marked ‘Lexy’ in the garage. With
text: purpose. Almost frantic.
text: Finally -- she finds what she’s looking for. A WEDDING RING.

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What are you up to, sweetie?
text: She swiftly turns and PLUNGES a KITCHEN KNIFE into his

dialog: down.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Yeah? And?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: The necklace. You said it had some
dialog: kind of effect on it, right? Like
dialog: it was hurt?
text: and turns around.
speaker_heading: TODD (cont'd)
dialog: I mean it sounds exactly like what
dialog: they were talking about.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Did they say anything about
dialog: destroying the spirit?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: No. This isn’t Hogwarts, Kellie.
text: and heads back to her car.
speaker_heading: TODD (cont'd)
dialog: Don’t you think you might be going

dialog: the ghosts and the voodoo stuff --
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: It’s not voodoo.
speaker_heading: TODD

scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - LATER
text: Kellie steps out of the tub and wraps herself in a towel.
text: She bends down and pulls the PLUG from the tub's drain --
text: but nothing happens. No bubbles... the water just sits
dialog: there.
text: Kellie gets on her knees and REACHES into the water... two
text: of her fingers enter THE DRAIN.
text: We PUSH IN on Kellie's face... cross-cutting with a PUSH IN
text: on her fingers in the drain... something awful is about to
dialog: happen...
text: ... but nothing does. Kellie pulls her hand out of the
dialog: water.
text: The tub remains full. The water sloshing from side to side.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK
text: Kellie sits at her desk -- using PLIERS to mash the metal of
text: the necklace chain back together.
text: We PUSH IN on the screen of her laptop -- she's been
text: googling Totems.
text: ONSCREEN -- an image of someone holding an object with some
text: kind of force radiating from it -- causing a spirit to
text: writhe in pain.
text: Done with the repair she heads to her bed and lays down --
text: gazing up at the necklace in her hands. Pondering her next
dialog: move.
text: Her eyes grow heavy, she tucks the necklace under her pillow
text: and settles in for a nap.
scene_heading: EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Dusk gives way to night.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: We hear the shower running. Steam fills the air.
dialog: 58.
text: We hear the squeak of the knobs as the shower is turned off.
text: James emerges and wraps himself in a towel.
text: Without noticing... he walks right past the bathroom mirror
text: as an unnatural condensation APPEARS.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: James crawls into bed with Robin, who is already asleep.
text: As his eyes flutter shut... we hear a soft, raspy sound in
text: the air. Something unnatural.
text: The sound grows louder as we TILT UP to an AIR VENT above.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: ANGLE -- the AIR VENT in Kellie's room. Emitting the same
text: creepy sound. It's getting louder...
text: Kellie stirs awake. She reaches under her pillow for the
dialog: necklace... but can't find it.
text: Panicked -- she sits up in bed and lifts up the pillow. The
text: necklace is gone.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: James and Robin are fast asleep.
text: ANGLE -- the AIR VENT. The raspy sound grows stronger.
text: At the other end of the room -- behind Robin's SCULPTURES --
text: the CURTAINS start BLOWING. The vent going full throttle.
text: One of the sculptures starts to RATTLE and SWAY with the
dialog: force of the air.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Kellie rushes over to Abby's room.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie SHAKES Abby awake.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What? What is it?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: My necklace. Have you seen it?

dialog: still...

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: She wanted it.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: ANGLE -- the AIR VENT. The raspy sound now fills the room.

text: She SHAKES James.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Wake up! Wake up!
text: He bolts up in bed. 'What the fuck is going on?'
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Jesus Christ.

speaker_heading: RATTLE.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (almost yelling)
dialog: Where is it?
text: We hear Robin SCREAM.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Papers swirl through the air. SCULPTURES shatter.
text: Robin's eyes dart to the chandelier above her and James.
text: Swaying dangerously back and forth.
text: The WALLPAPER bubbles and moves -- suddenly something

dialog: Where’s the necklace?
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The chandelier pries loose from its moorings.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Look out!

text: CERAMIC and GLASS SHATTER into a THOUSAND JAGGED FRAGMENTS.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Abby scurries over to a SHELF FULL OF DOLLS and pulls the
text: necklace off the neck of an OLDER DOLL hidden in the middle.
text: She hands it to Kellie.
text: Kellie PULLS on either side of the necklace. SNAPPING it

text: We hear a SHRIEK.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

text: A RATTLING inside her closet -- something in there is trying
dialog: to get out.
text: Abby -- sniffling and wiping tears from her cheeks -- gets
text: out of bed.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Mommy ?
text: Abby's eyes widen in FEAR. Kellie turns and steps towards
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What is it?
text: Abby SCREAMS as she's PULLED across the floor by her ankles
text: into the closet.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: No!
text: Kellie grabs Abby’s wrist but falls back and SLAMS into her
text: bedside table.
text: She gets up and grabs Abby’s wrist again -- but whatever is
text: pulling on Abby is too strong.
text: James bursts into the room -- sees the terrifying
text: spectacle -- grabs Abby’s other wrist and PULLS her out of
dialog: the closet.
text: He scoops her up and carries her out of the room.
text: Kellie looks down at the broken necklace. Slack around her
dialog: arm.
dialog: It's gone. For now.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Robin turns on the sink and splashes water on her face.
text: She glances back in the mirror...
text: ...She looks DEAD. PALE with PURPLE BRUISING, WET MATTED
text: HAIR. Swollen. Like she's been face down in the water for
dialog: two days.
text: The door SHAKES. Robin SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (0.S8.)
dialog: It’s me!
text: She looks in the mirror again -- back to normal. ‘What the

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I'll be right out.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (0.S.)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: ROBIN

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - LATER

text: James pulls out his cell.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We need to get you guys out of
dialog: here.
text: Kellie grabs his hand.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: You need to ask why this is
dialog: happening now. What's new here?
text: BEHIND THEM -- Robin appears. In shock. Cheeks stained with
dialog: tears.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I'm gonna pack a bag.
dialog: (to Abby)
dialog: You're coming with me. I'm not
dialog: letting you out of my sight.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie opens the door and guides Abby -- scared and in
dialog: shock -- inside.
text: They don't see the SILHOUETTED FIGURE sitting on the bed
text: until... Kellie flicks on the LIGHTS.
text: She JUMPS BACK and gasps for breath... it's just Todd.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Jesus, Todd. Not a good time.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (re: terrified Abby)
dialog: You need to learn how to read the
dialog: room a little bit, man.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I found something out...
text: He pulls out his iPhone.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Oh come on I know how to use
dialog: Google, Todd.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: No no no. I took pictures at the
dialog: library. Look, a Totem is something
dialog: that meant a lot to a person while
dialog: they were alive...
text: ON TODD'S PHONE -- We SWIPE through photos he took of an OLD
text: BOOK -- illustrations of different TOTEMS. All shapes and
text: sizes. Some of them jewelry, some of them not.
speaker_heading: TODD (cont'd)
dialog: .».. and now they're bound to it in
dialog: death.
text: ON TODD'S PHONE -- illustrations of bones being CRUSHED
text: alongside jewelry. A Funeral pyre with onlookers placing
text: Totems upon the flames etc...
speaker_heading: TODD (cont'd)
dialog: It has to be touching a piece of
dialog: the person but... I think maybe we
dialog: can get rid of this thing.
text: Kellie covers Abby's ears.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
text: Not in front of Abby. It's been a
dialog: rough night.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: James opens the door and Bernard steps inside -- looks
dialog: everyone over.
text: Kellie, Robin and Todd are huddled in the living room.
text: Silent. Everyone is scared... except for Todd.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Thanks for coming. I just need you
dialog: to take the girls while I clean up
dialog: and I'll meet you at your place.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: While you clean up?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I'm Todd, FYI.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: That's nice.
dialog: (to James)
dialog: What the hell is going on here?
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Bernard surveys the damage from the middle of the room while
text: everyone else watches near the doorway.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Hold on a hot minute now. You guys
dialog: think a ghost is doing this?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Something like that.
dialog: Bernard shrugs -- 'okaaaaayyyy.'
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Maybe this is my fault. I mean I
dialog: encouraged her to talk to it...
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: For once I agree with you.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Kellie, enough!
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: No. Not enough! You saw that thing
dialog: try to take Abby, right? It's
dialog: threatening my family. I'm not
dialog: going to just sit back!
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: (to Kellie)
dialog: So what’s it doing? Is there any
dialog: pattern to it?
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (stares at Robin)
dialog: It followed her here. Maybe it
dialog: wants to warn us.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (grits her teeth)
text: Abby thinks it's Lexy.
text: Bernard turns around to face James. Determined. No BS.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Not anymore, now she's scared of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: And you saw it too?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I saw something, I think. I don't
dialog: know what it was.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: And you don't leave immediately?
dialog: You have me come get the girls
dialog: while you do... what?
dialog: (looks James right in the
dialog: eye)
dialog: If you thought it wasn't her you
dialog: would have just driven them over
dialog: yourself.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If my little girl is here, I want
dialog: to know.
text: Bernard sits on the bed. Quickly and urgently -- as if
text: staving off a fall.
text: Robin rushes to him.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: You guys can leave if you want. But
dialog: if there's any chance in hell it's
dialog: my daughter I'm staying.
text: Kellie looks around. Todd, Robin, James, Bernard... that's
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Wait. Where's Abby?
dialog: 66.
text: Everyone looks around...
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Shit.
text: James peers into the hallway -- she's nowhere to be seen. He
text: heads out of the room.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: Abby!
text: Kellie turns to Robin.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: See what you've done?
text: James steps back into the doorway.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I know you think it's my fault --
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: It's not just me. Do you really
dialog: think he’1l want anything to do
dialog: with you after this?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Kellie, stop!
text: Kellie steps towards Robin.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I mean you knew my Mom but you
dialog: really liked my Dad.
dialog: (off Robin's look)
dialog: You think I didn't know that? You
dialog: don’t think after this we’re all
dialog: starting to wonder what you did to
dialog: take my Mom's place?
text: Bernard glances between Robin and Kellie.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I don't know why I had my bags
dialog: ready. The only one who should be
dialog: packing... is you.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Jesus Christ, stop! Let’s just find
dialog: her!
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (eyes still on Robin)
dialog: Fine by me.
dialog: 67.
text: Kellie heads into the hallway. James and Todd follow.
text: Bernard stands up to join the search. Robin -- pulling
text: herself together -- sits him back down on the bed.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You should sit down. You don’t look
dialog: so good.
text: Bernard -- takes a puff from his inhaler -- nods and eyes
text: Robin suspiciously.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Go check on the girl. I’1ll be fine.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Kellie heads into the hallway.
text: Everyone follows... except for Bernard who lingers behind in
dialog: the Master Bedroom.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Abby!
dialog: (to everyone)
dialog: Check under all the beds.
text: Kellie pulls Todd aside.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: We need to get rid of this thing.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: We still need a piece of the
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Like a part of their body?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Yeah, that and the Totem have to be
dialog: destroyed together or it's no good.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: We don't have that. Is there a
dialog: shortcut?
speaker_heading: JAMES (0.S.)
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Abby!
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Check her room. I'll be right back.
text: Todd dutifully heads into Abby's room.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Todd opens the closet... nothing. He checks under the bed...
dialog: nothing.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: James searches the room. Looks behind the curtains. Nothing.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (to Robin)
dialog: Find her?
text: Robin looks around... pulls cushions from the couch.
dialog: Anything she can do.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Not yet.
text: She heads into the kitchen and out of sight. Kellie enters
text: and BUMPS into James. He's starting to panic.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Where the hell is she?
dialog: (to Kellie)
dialog: I should have listened to you.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (0.S.)
dialog: It's gonna be okay, James.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Robin goddammit just help me find
dialog: her!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Robin’s searching the pantry when she hears this. She stands
text: up -- tears welling in her eyes.
text: She retreats through the back of the kitchen into the
dialog: hallway.
dialog: 69.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie leans in close to James.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Dad, if this thing took her, we're
dialog: not going to find her. Not like
dialog: this.
text: On James -- he can't accept it.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: She was terrified, maybe she's
text: hiding outside.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Maybe. Let's hope so.
text: James nods and heads out the front door as Kellie presses
dialog: on.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Bernard bends down and checks under the bed... nothing.
text: He stands up -- suddenly gets dizzy. Short of breath, he
text: sits on the bed and pulls out his inhaler.
text: Kellie enters -- 'he doesn't look so good.'
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: You doing okay?
text: Bernard nods.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Just a lot to take in. You seem
dialog: awful sure this isn't her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe you'd be jealous if it was.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Trust me. I was never jealous of
dialog: her.
text: Kellie looks down at her wrist -- the necklace TIGHTENS
text: around it. Whatever this is... it's coming back.
text: She peers out the door and down the empty hallway -- 'where
dialog: the hell is Robin?'
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Robin sits on Kellie's bed and buries her head in her
text: hands -- fighting back tears. On the verge of letting it all
dialog: out.
text: She straightens herself out a bit... looks around... she's
dialog: alone.
dialog: THEN...
text: She suddenly sees her shadow on the wall -- growing in
text: size -- illuminated by the light from a presence behind her.
text: She turns around -- a vapor begins to take shape under the
text: trophy shelf.
text: Then... a single trophy falls from the shelf. PLUNK. It
text: lands on the carpet.
text: World's Best Daughter. The LID POPS half off.
text: The vapor disappears.
text: Robin looks up to the shelf, then to the trophy on the
dialog: floor -- 'what the fuck?'
text: Robin bends down and picks it up. She reaches inside...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie slowly makes her way to her room... the door open at
text: the end of the hall.
text: Her eyes dart around... keeping a lookout...
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie enters to find Robin sitting on the floor. In the
text: palm of her hand -- Lexy’s wedding ring.
text: INSERT -- an engraving inside the ring. ‘Lexy and James ~
speaker_heading: August 9th 1998’
text: Kellie closes the door and slowly approaches her. Robin gets
text: up and backs away.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Why would you have this? Why would
dialog: you keep this from your Dad
dialog: unless --
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Just, relax. Okay?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: She's been trying to tell us this
dialog: whole time.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Look, you don't know what it was
dialog: like. She and Dad weren't happy. He
dialog: needed someone stronger.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: What? Like you?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Exactly like me.
text: Robin backs into the bathroom... Kellie follows.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: ANGLE -- the bathtub. Still full of water from earlier.
text: Kellie sees that Robin is looking past her... back into the
dialog: bedroom...
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Stay away from me.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Don’t worry about Dad. He’s in the
text: right hands.
text: A GLOW fills the room... Kellie turns around...
text: A BRIGHT presence in the air...
text: A SHRIEK fills the room as the bright presence TURNS BLACK.
text: WIND fills the room.
text: Backing up... Robin trips and FALLS backwards into the tub.
text: SPLASH. She HITS her head on the faucet on the way down.
text: Unconscious... Robin's head bobs limply. BLOOD colors the
dialog: water.
text: Kellie steps forward -- places a single finger on Robin's
text: forehead -- and PUSHES her underwater.
text: We watch the BUBBLES stream out of Robin's nose... until
dialog: they stop.
dialog: 72.
text: Kellie removes her finger... Robin floats. Absolutely still.
text: Kellie looks around. Lexy is gone. The wind has stopped.
text: She gets up and exits the bathroom. Robin’s profile surfaces
text: in the bathwater. Not breathing.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie picks up the ‘World’s Best Daughter’ trophy and
text: places it back on the shelf.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Todd's growing impatient -- 'I can't just sit here.'
text: Todd reaches for the door -- but Kellie opens it first. She
text: enters the room... faking a panic.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Don't go out there. It killed
dialog: Robin.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Oh my God.
text: Kellie nods -- feigning sadness.
speaker_heading: TODD (cont'd)
dialog: We have to get out of here.
text: Todd reaches for the window. Kellie rushes over to him and
text: places her hands on top of his -- stopping him.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Wait! Robin was trying to leave
dialog: too... when it got her. Let’s just
dialog: figure this out.
text: She paces the room... thinking. Then... she looks to the box
text: of Lexy's stuff on the bedside table.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: What was that you were saying? Part
dialog: of the body?
text: She sits on the bed, opens the box and pulls out the LOCK OF
scene_heading: LEXY'S HAIR.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: A piece of the person?
dialog: 73.
text: She looks down at the box.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: All I have to do is drop the
dialog: necklace in and...
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: ... destroy it. At the same time.
text: She puts the hair back in the box -- closes it -- and looks
text: up to Todd.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I need her in front of me. I need
dialog: to see this work.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Don’t you mean ‘it?’ How do you
dialog: know it’s a woman?
text: Kellie sighs and looks up at him.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Because it’s my mother.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: So that’s her necklace.
text: Kellie stares at the necklace -- quietly reliving the
dialog: memory.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I gave it to her the day before she
dialog: died. She was so happy when she got
dialog: it... she thought it meant we'd
dialog: stop fighting...
text: She places the box firmly in Todd’s hands
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Hold on to this. Don’t let it out
dialog: of your sight.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: We need something that’1l make her
dialog: show herself.
text: Kellie heads into the hall and shuts the door behind her.
text: Todd sits back on the bed, the box in one hand and his phone
text: in the other.
dialog: 74.
text: ON TODD'S PHONE -- an illustration of a necklace and a pile
text: of teeth burning together ina fire.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Bernard -- still on the bed and short of breath -- HEARS
text: something. A faint RATTLING.
scene_heading: BAP. BAP. BAP.
text: He looks to the floor. A PANEL shifts slightly.
text: He stands up... bends down and finds a LATCH. He pulls the
text: panel up -- it's a CRAWL SPACE.
text: He sees Abby in the darkness below.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Shhh!
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: What are you doing in there?
text: Bernard takes a pull from his inhaler.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Kellie told me to hide.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: What? Come on out.
text: Kellie enters the room.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Pull the panel shut, Abby. It's not
dialog: safe yet.
text: Abby's hand emerges from the hole and pulls the panel shut.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: What the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing?
text: Wheezing heavily... he lifts the inhaler towards his mouth
text: Kellie gently reaches out and PRIES it from his hands.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Let me help you with that.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: I always knew there was something
dialog: wrong with you.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (fake panic)
dialog: Abby stay down there! The ghost is
dialog: hurting Bernard!
text: Bernard reaches out to grab his inhaler.
text: She takes a step back and presses the button, letting all
text: the vapor out... HISSSSS.
text: Bernard gasps for air... but it's not coming.
text: Bernard flops onto his belly and starts CRAWLING into the
dialog: hallway.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Kellie leisurely trails after Bernard as he crawls away.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Last thing she said to me... she
dialog: thought you liked your father a
dialog: little too much.
text: His breaths turn short and hiccup-y. He finally gives up and
text: rolls back over.
speaker_heading: BERNARD (cont'd)
dialog: You always were a Daddy's girl.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I'm really sorry. This whole thing
dialog: got screwed up. But you have to
dialog: understand... I'm just trying to
dialog: keep everyone together.
text: Bernard looks up at her... his eyes wounded and betrayed as
text: he STOPS BREATHING.
text: She bends over and respectfully closes his eyes with her
dialog: fingers.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie heads back into the bedroom and pulls the crawl space
text: panel open.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Did I do a good job?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You did great.
text: She PULLS Abby out of the space and into the room.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I just needed to make sure you were
text: safe from the ghost.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I didn't make a noise even when Dad
dialog: called.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Don't beat yourself up.
text: She gets parental and serious.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Remember, all Dad needs to know is
dialog: that you’re scared of this thing.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie picks Abby up and steps over Bernard as they head
text: into the hall.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Don’t look down, okay? You don’t
dialog: need to see this.
text: Abby closes her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kellie enters as Todd paces nervously -- dutifully holding
dialog: the box.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Look, I found Abby but my Dad will
dialog: be back any second. I need you to
dialog: keep him distracted while I get rid
dialog: of this thing.
text: She takes the box from him.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: How?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I don’t know. Just keep him
text: outside.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: What do you mean “no?”
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: We need to tell him it’s her. If
dialog: this thing killed Robin he needs to
dialog: know who it is.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Because it’s the right thing to do.
dialog: You don’t have anything to hide.
text: Todd reaches for the door. Kellie BLOCKS him.
speaker_heading: TODD (cont'd)
dialog: You think I’1l always just do what
dialog: you say, don’t you?
text: On Kellie -- sad but determined.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: That’s what you’re here for.
text: Kellie PULLS Todd in for a kiss.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: So people don’t ask questions about
dialog: me.
text: Todd accepts the kiss .. he’s been waiting for so long for
text: this moment... but a second after their lips connect his
text: eyes widen. BULGING.
text: He pulls away in pain. We pull around to reveal the THREE-
text: PRONGED GARDEN TROWEL embedded in his back.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I really like you Todd. But we
dialog: could never be together. I belong
text: to someone else.
text: She pulls the trowel out of Todd’s back... and advances
text: towards him.
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Robin floats in the bath -- her face breaking the water. Not
dialog: moving.
text: TAP. A drop of water falls from the shower head and lands on
text: her forehead.
text: TAP. Another one.
text: We hear a small underwater POP... the tub finally starts to
dialog: drain.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The front door opens and James steps inside. Kellie exits
text: Abby's room and RUSHES into his arms.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Thank God you’re back!
text: James looks down and sees Abby.
text: Kellie pulls away from him as he kneels down and puts his
text: arms on Abby’s shoulders.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Where the hell were you?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: We need to get out of here right
dialog: now.
text: James looks past Kellie into the hallway and sees Bernard on
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Oh my God, Bernard!
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: James tentatively approaches Bernard's body -- still several
text: meters away.
text: Kellie jumps in front of James -- blocking his progress.
text: Right in front of Abby's open door.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: This thing got everyone. If we stay
dialog: any longer we --
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Where... where’s Robin?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Dad, let’s go.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Robin!
text: He opens his mouth to call out again but stops once he
text: turns... and sees Todd's BODY in Abby's room.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: James enters and kneels beside Todd. He looks up at Kellie.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You're telling me this thing... did
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: That’s why Kellie told me to hide
text: in the crawl space.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Abby!
text: Confused, James looks from Abby to Kellie.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Wait... you told her to hide?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: I didn’t want it to know where she
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Why not just get her out of the
dialog: house like I asked?
text: James sees Abby in the doorway gazing at Todd’s corpse.

text: James rises to his feet -- stares Kellie square in the eye.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: Where is she?
dialog: 80.
text: On Kellie -- she can’t come up with an answer. She sees
text: James’ face fall as he takes a step away from her.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Why are you looking at me like
dialog: that?
text: James -- speechless -- pushes past her on his way to the
dialog: door.
text: Kellie GRABS his arm but James PULLS AWAY.
text: Desperate -- Kellie grabs a SNOW GLOBE from Abby's dresser
text: SMASHES James in the head with it. GLASS and WATER fly
text: through the air.
text: James hits the ground -- out cold.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: James wakes up in a haze. Everything’s blurry. He STRUGGLES
dialog: to stand up.
text: REVEAL -- James is tied to a chair.
text: The box is on the floor. Kellie DOUSES it with LIGHTER
speaker_heading: FLUID.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (muttering to herself)
dialog: Come on, Mom. You’ve been showing
dialog: up every five fucking minutes.
dialog: Where are you when we really need
dialog: you?
text: Abby sits in the corner -- scared but dutifully holding a
scene_heading: CHARCOAL LIGHTER.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (groggy )
dialog: Why would you...
dialog: (sees the lighter fluid)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Oh, you’re awake.
dialog: (re: the box)
dialog: I’m making us safe again.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Don’t worry, I'll be careful.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It’s her, isn’t it?
text: Kellie sighs and nods reluctantly -- ‘yes.’
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: She knew we’d be in danger when
dialog: Robin moved in. From you.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: That's ridiculous. I wouldn't hurt
dialog: you. I protected you. I’ve been
dialog: protecting you for years. I got rid
dialog: of the drama. I got rid of the
dialog: yelling. Think about how much
dialog: happier we all were once she...
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You killed her.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
text: I pushed her. Gravity did the rest.
text: She catches James looking at the necklace wrapped around her
text: forearm. The bruises. The blood.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I’m sorry, I didn’t want you to
dialog: know it was her.
text: James breaks down in tears.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Don't be sad! This is totally
dialog: fixable! We'll go back to the way
dialog: it was. Just us. You, me and Abby.
dialog: No Mom, no Robin...
dialog: (genuine)
dialog: Weren't the past five years great?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Robin! Robin!
scene_heading: INT. KELLIE'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The last of the water has drained from the tub. Robin lays
text: soaking on the bare porcelain.
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kellie grabs the lighter from Abby.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (to James)
dialog: What is it you don’t understand! We
dialog: don’t need her.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (calls out again)
dialog: Robin!
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: She can’t hear you.
text: Kellie’s ready to torch the box. Her eyes scan the room for
text: any sign of Lexy as she CLICKS the lighter.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Why don’t we stop and figure this
dialog: out together?
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Where have I heard that before?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Please. Let me fix this.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: No. You’re not good at that.
dialog: Without me, Mom would have
dialog: destroyed this family years ago.
text: Kellie grabs Abby’s hand and pulls her close.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (to Abby)
dialog: I need you to cry out for her. Cry
dialog: out for Mom.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: But what if she’s listening to you
dialog: now? She knows what you’re doing.
text: Kellie closes her eyes and sighs -- ‘goddammit.’
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: You're right.
text: Kellie pulls the necklace off her arm and WRAPS IT AROUND
scene_heading: ABBY'S NECK.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Let’s see if she cares about you as
dialog: much as I do.
text: Kellie sees James’ eyes widen as he looks past her.
text: Something’s behind her.
text: Kellie releases Abby and turns to see... Robin. Soaking wet.
text: Bloodshot eyes. Pissed off.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: It’s over, Kellie.
text: Kellie DIVES for the box. Robin quickly approaches and
text: SNATCHES it out of her hands.
text: Kellie jumps to her feet.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: No! Don’t!
text: Robin lets the box fall to the floor and STOMPS on it. The
text: BOX SHATTERS.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I’m so sick of you. Talking about
dialog: how you protect them.
text: Kellie crawls on her knees -- grabbing the lock of hair and
text: trying to get as many pieces of the box as she can.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (cont'd)
dialog: You don’t give a shit about
dialog: protecting them. You want to
dialog: possess them.
text: Kellie gets back on her feet and takes a step towards Abby.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (fuming)
dialog: That is not true.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Abby, come here.
text: Abby takes a step away from Kellie towards Robin.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (hurt )
dialog: Abby... seriously?
text: Abby pauses and looks at Kellie.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Abby, listen to Robin.
text: Kellie -- utterly lost -- looks to James.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: We're going to get you some help,
dialog: Kellie.
text: Confused -- she takes a step towards him.
speaker_heading: JAMES (cont'd)
dialog: You’re not well.
text: Kellie takes another step.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: We're not going to be together
dialog: anymore?
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You don’t mean that.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (a burst of emotion)
dialog: You destroyed everything!
text: Kellie LEAPS onto James -- still tied to the chair -- and
text: wraps her arms TIGHT around him.
text: Manic. Flailing. The first time we’ve seen her totally out
dialog: of control.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: No, I’ve done everything! I made
dialog: this family! You can’t take it away
dialog: from me!
text: The room starts to shake ever so slightly. Kellie hangs on
dialog: to him for dear life.
text: She pulls him TIGHTER. He can’t breathe. Her arms slip
text: and -- almost subconsciously -- wrap around his neck.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Kellie, stop!
text: The necklace once again DIGS into Kellie’s wrist. The room
text: SHAKES violently now.
text: Robin GRABS HOLD of Kellie’s arm.
text: Kellie refuses to let go. James struggles but she’s
text: smothering him. The chair LEANS back on its rear legs.
dialog: 85.
text: WIND fills the room. DEBRIS FLIES through the air.
text: The chair TOPPLES over -- sending Kellie flying to the
text: floor. The shelf next to them COLLAPSES. FRAMED PICTURES of
text: the family fall onto Kellie. GLASS SHATTERS all over her.
text: A loud CRACKING BOOM.
text: LEXY APPEARS in specter form and hovers menacingly above the
dialog: family.
text: James’ eyes widen in terror.
text: That awful supernatural SHRIEK pierces the air.
text: Another BOOMING SOUND... LEXY floats in front of them.
text: Vaporous, ethereal and unmistakably her.
text: She’s surrounded by a HAZE OF ENERGY.
text: James’ eyes fill with tears, relief and closure. Robin
text: comforts Abby as the little girl looks up in wonder.
text: Kellie averts her eyes in anger and shame -- she can’t even
text: look at her.
text: Lexy turns to vapor and MOVES THROUGH JAMES -- a radiant
text: stream -- disappearing as she does so.
text: Kellie turns to see Robin clutching Abby. Protecting her.
text: Kellie grabs a SHARD OF GLASS from one of the shattered
text: frames and runs after Robin -- forcing her into the hallway.

dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Kellie... your hand.
text: Kellie looks down at the blood dripping from her hand.
text: Kellie RACES towards her -- the shard of glass raised high.
text: Robin BACKS UP and SLAMS into the trophy shelf. TROPHIES
text: TOPPLE to the ground.
speaker_heading: JAMES (0.C.)
dialog: Just stop!
text: Kellie spins around -- surprised to see James in the
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: KELLIE
dialog: Dad?
text: She looks him in the eye... almost pleading.
speaker_heading: KELLIE (cont'd)
dialog: You replaced me.
text: Kellie once again LUNGES at Robin and TRIPS over the
text: ‘World’s Best Daughter’ trophy and FALLS face first towards
text: the razor sharp sculpture in the corner.
text: Robin reaches out to stop her.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: No no no!
text: CLOSE on Robin's face. A sickening SHHHK as Kellie's SCREAMS
text: fill the air.
text: James rushes over to help Kellie -- but we know by the look
text: on his face it’s too late.
text: He crumples to his knees, sobbing.
text: TIGHT ON Kellie’s face. Wide-eyed shock and terror.
text: THE CAMERA SPINS AROUND to the MIRROR opposite her. We
text: realize she’s staring at her own reflection -- she watches
text: as the color drains from her own face.

text: Kellie is covered by a WHITE SHEET. Blood seeping through
