scene_heading: EXT. VIETNAM - DUSK
text: A swarm of helicopters swoops out of a yellow sky and deposits an army
text: of men over a Vietnamese hillside.
text: The SOLDIERS scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the protection
text: of the jungle. Falling into coulmns, like strands of soldier ants,
text: seventy-five men, at combat readiness, assemble on the edge of a
text: sweltering wilderness.
text: It is dusk. The mood is lazy, soporific. Members of one platoon huddle
text: close to the ground smoking a joint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Strong stuff.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: (to JACOB, a soldier
text: squatting several yards
dialog: away)
dialog: Hey, Professor, how many times can
dialog: you shit in an hour?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don't bug 'im.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Where are those gooks already?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Some offensive. I don't even think
dialog: they're out there.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Jesus, this grass is something else.
text: JACOB SINGER returns to the group, pulling up his pants.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Why even bother to pull 'em up?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You jackin' off out there again, huh
dialog: Jake?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey, get off his back.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: It's called philosophizing, right
dialog: Professor?
text: JACOB gives them the finger.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Up yours, you adolescent scum.
text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT (V.O.)
dialog: Mount your bayonets.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Oh shit!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Goddam!
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Gimme that joint!
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Hey, something's wrong.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: My head.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's nerves. Take another toke.
text: GEORGE reaches out, extending a joint. Suddenly he gasps and falls to
text: the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. The others stand back,
text: startled. JACOB grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his
text: chattering teeth.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: What's going on?
text: Before anyone can answer JERRY grabs his head, screaming. He turns
text: frantically in all directions.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Help me! Help me!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What the hell ... ?
text: In seconds JERRY is spinning wildly out of control, his head shaking
text: into a terrific blur. He crashes into FRANK with the force of a truck.
text: FRANK slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs. He
text: begins gasping and hyperventilating. His eyes grow wide and frenzied as
text: he gulps for air. Fear and confusion sweep across his face. The MEN
text: watch, horrified, as FRANK's terror escalates beyond reason into all-
text: out panic.
text: Suddenly FRANK begins howling. He lunges for his bayonet and, without
text: warning, attacks the MEN around him.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: God Almighty!
text: PAUL spins out of the way as FRANK's bayonet impales the ground. JACOB
text: jumps on top of FRANK and wrestles him into the tall grass. PAUL rushes
text: to his assistance.
text: JACOB stares at FRANK's face as FRANK struggles beneath him. It is the
text: face of a madman.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Good God! What's happening?
text: The sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting
text: behind them. Guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening
dialog: sky.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Behind you! Look out! This is it!
text: The MEN spin around. PAUL panics and jumps to his feet, leaving JACOB
text: alone with FRANK. FRANK's eyes burn with demonic force as he gathers
dialog: his strength.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Don't leave me.
text: Dark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming at them.
text: SOLDIERS squint to see. It is a horrifying vision.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: They're coming!
text: Gunfire explodes on all sides. Suddenly PAUL flips out. He begins
text: screaming uncontrollably, ripping at his clothes and skin. FRANK is
text: struggling like four men and JACOB is weakening in his effort to
text: restrain him. Bayonets glimmer in the exchange of fire. Bodies fall.
text: More bodies keep coming. The first wave is upon them.
text: ROD shoots into the air. Shadowy forms hurl forward screaming like
text: banshees. ROD, squinting, jabs with his bayonet, piercing the belly of
text: his attacker. Agonizing cries accompany his fall. ROD yanks the bayonet
text: out and stabs again.
text: In the midst of this madness FRANK shoots to his feet and slams the
text: butt of his rifle into JACOB's back. There is a cracking sound. JACOB's
text: eyes freeze with pain. His hands rush for his spine. As he spins around
text: one of the ATTACKERS jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into
text: JACOB's stomach. JACOB screams. It is a loud and piercing wail.
text: CUT ON THE SOUND OF THE SCREAM to a sudden rush through a long dark
text: tunnel. There is a sense of enormous speed accelerating toward a
text: brilliant light. The rush suggests a passage between life and death,
text: but as the light bursts upon us we realize that we are passing through
text: a SUBWAY STATION far below the city of NEW YORK.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT
text: THE WHEELS OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN screech through the station. JACOB
text: SINGER, sitting alone in the last car, wakes up. The sounds of the
text: scream and the grating wheels merge. He is dazed and confused, not
text: certain where he is.
text: JACOB glances around the empty car. His eyes gravitate to overhead
text: advertisements for hemorrhoid perparations and savings banks. Gradually
text: his confusion subsides. Shifting uncomfortably he pulls a thick book
text: out of his back pocket, "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. He begins
text: reading. Another station blurs by.
text: JACOB is a good-looking man, of obvious intelligence. He is in his mid-
text: thirties. It is surprising that he is wearing a mailman's uniform. He
dialog: doesn't look like one.
text: The subway ride seems to go on interminably. JACOB is restless and
text: concerned. He glances at his watch. It is 3:30 A.M. Putting his book in
text: his back pocket, JACOB stands up and makes his way through the deserted
dialog: car.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRACKS - NIGHT
text: JACOB enters the rumbling passageway between the cars. The wheels spark
text: against the rails. The dark tunnel walls flash by. He pulls the handle
text: on the door to the next car. It is stuck. He struggles with it. A LADY
text: sitting alone inside turns to look at him. She seems threatened by his
text: effort. He motions for her to help. She turns away.
text: A look of disgust crosses JACOB's face. He kicks the door. It slides
text: open. The WOMAN seems frightened as he approaches her.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Excuse me, do you know if we've
dialog: passed Nostrand Avenue yet?
dialog: (she doesn't answer)
dialog: Excuse me.
dialog: (she does not
dialog: acknowledge his
dialog: existence)
dialog: Look, I'm asking a simple question.
dialog: Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell
dialog: asleep.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (speaking with a Puerto
dialog: Rican accent)
dialog: I no from around here.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (glad for a response)
dialog: Yeah, you and everyone else.
text: JACOB walks to the other end of the car and sits down. The only other
text: passenger is an OLD MAN lying asleep on the fiberglass bench.
text: Occasionally his body shudders. It is the only sign of life in him.
text: The train begins to slow down. JACOB peers out of the window. Nostrand
text: Avenue signs appear. He is relieved. He gets up and grabs hold of the
text: overhead bar.
text: The OLD MAN shudders and stretches out on the seat. As he adjusts his
text: position, tugging at his coat, JACOB catches a brief glimpse of
text: something protruding from beneath the coat's hem. His eyes fixate on
text: the spot, waiting for another look. There is a slight movement and it
text: appears - a long, red, fleshy protuberance. The sight of it sends
text: shivers up JACOB's spine. It looks strangely like a tail. Only the
text: stopping of the train breaks JACOB's stare.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT
text: JACOB is the only passenger getting off. The doors close quickly behind
text: him. He glances at the LADY sitting by the window. There is a fearful
text: expression on her face as the train carries her back into the dark
text: tunnel, out of his sight.
text: JACOB reaches the exit, a huge metal revolving door surrounded by floor
text: to ceiling gates. He is about to push when he notices a chain locking
text: it shut. He stares at it in disbelief.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Goddam it.
text: He turns in a huff and hikes to the other end of the platform. As he
text: approaches the far exit, his eyes widen. The gate there is also locked.
text: His hands reach for his hips as he studies an impossible situation.
text: CUT TO JACOB stepping cautiously onto the ladder going down to the
text: tracks. A rat scampers by and he gasps.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No way!
text: He starts to climb back up the ladder but sees that there is nowhere
text: else to go. He juts out his jaw and steps back down.
text: JACOB is not comfortable on the tracks. He cannot see where he is
text: stepping. His shoes slpash in unseen liquid which makes him grimace.
text: The steel girders are coated in subway grime. The oily substance coats
text: his hands as he reaches for support.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Goddam fucking city!
text: He wipes the grime on his postal uniform as he steps toward the center
text: track. He reaches for another girder when it begins to vibrate. Two
text: pinpoints of light hurl toward him. Then the noise arrives confirming
text: his fear. A train is bearing down on him. JACOB looks frightened, not
text: sure which way to go. He steps forward, up to his ankle in slime. He
text: cannot tell which track the train is on. It is moving at phenomenal
text: speed. The station is spinning. The train's lights merge into one
dialog: brilliant intensity.
text: In near panic JACOB jumps across the track as the train spins by. Its
text: velocity blows his hair straight up as though it is standing on end. He
text: clings to a pillar for support, gasping in short breaths.
text: A few PEOPLE are staring at JACOB from the train. Their faces, pressed
text: up against the glass, seem deformed. A lone figure waves at him from
text: the rear window. The train bears them all away. Then it is quiet again.
text: For a moment JACOB is afraid to move but slowly regains his composure.
text: He continues to the other side of the tracks and stumbles up the ladder
text: to the UPTOWN PLATFORM.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: JACOB smiling. The smile, however, is one of irony, not amusement. This
text: exit too is locked. A heavy chain is wrapped through the bars. JACOB
text: stares at it with an expression of total bewilderment.
text: A sudden muffled scream alerts JACOB that he is not alone. His head
text: turns but sees no one. He hears the scream again. He senses its
text: direction and walks toward the MEN'S ROOM. A crack of light appears
text: under the door. He can hear someone moaning inside. JACOB knocks softly
text: and the moaning stops. The lights click off.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hey, is someone in there?
text: There is no answer. JACOB stands silently for a moment, not sure what
text: to do. He can hear whispering. He chews his lower lip nervously and
text: then reaches for the door. It pushes open.
text: The light from the station penetrates the darkness. He gasps. He sees a
text: MAN tied naked to the stall with ANOTHER NAKED MAN grabbing quickly for
text: his clothes. The BOUND MAN screams.
speaker_heading: BOUND MAN
dialog: Fuck off! Mind your own business!
text: A THIRD MAN spins out of the shadows, pointing a kinfe at JACOB's
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You cocksucker! Get outta here.
text: The MAN's face is barely human. Before JACOB can even react the door
text: slams shut. The lock engages. The crack of light reappears. JACOB can
text: hear laughter coming from inside, followed by a scream. He backs away
text: from the door. His face is white.
text: JACOB turns with full fury and storms the gate. The chain gives wayto
text: his anger. It flies apart and the gate flings open. He stands in
text: amazement, observing the chain as it slides from between the bars and
text: drops to the concrete below. The gate squeaks loudly as JACOB pushes it
text: aside and clangs with an almost painful burst as he slams it shut.
scene_heading: EXT. WILMINGTON TOWERS - DAWN
text: JACOB walks toward the towering shadows of a massive PUBLIC HOUSING
text: PROJECT. It is dark and the moonlight silhouettes the huge monolithic
text: structures. JACOB passes through a vast COURTYARD dominated by the
text: imposing shapes. Aside from his moving body everything is still.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAWN
text: JACOB steps off a graffiti-festooned ELEVATOR into a long impersonal
text: hallway. He uses three keys to unlock the door to his APARTMENT.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APT. - DAWN
text: JACOB enters the darkness without turning on the light. He tries to
text: navigate his way to the BATHROOM, illuminated by a tiny nightlight in
text: the distance. His effort is unsuccessful. He bangs loudly into a table.
text: A WOMAN"s voice calls out.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE (V.O.)
dialog: Jake, is that you?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What the hell did you do, move all
dialog: the furniture?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE (V.O.)
dialog: Why didn't you turn on the light?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I didn't want to wake you.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE (V.O.)
dialog: (sleepy but pleasant)
dialog: Gee, thanks a lot.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where is the lamp?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE (V.O.)
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: If I knew I wouldn't have to ask.
dialog: What did you do? I was happy the way
dialog: it was.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE (V.O.)
dialog: I moved the couch. That's all.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where to?
text: JACOB crashes into it. A light suddenly goes on. JEZEBEL "JEZZIE"
text: PIPKIN, 33, is standing in the BEDROOM door tying a man's terrycloth
text: bathrobe around her waist. Although sleepy, disheveled, and not looking
text: her best, it is obvious that JEZZIE is a beefy woman, juicy and
dialog: sensual.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: That help?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (nearly sprawled over
dialog: the couch)
dialog: Thanks.
text: He pushes himself up.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: The room!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come
dialog: you're so late?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Roberts didn't show up. What could I
dialog: say? Besides, it's double time.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (seeing the grease on
dialog: his uniform)
dialog: What happened to you?
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: (unbuttoning his shirt
text: as he walks to the
speaker_heading: BATHROOM)
dialog: Don't ask.
text: JACOB steps into the BATHROOM and pulls at his clothes, leaving them in
text: a pile on the floor. He reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of
text: water pouding against the porcelain tub. JEZZIE enjoys JACOB's
text: nakedness. She reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his
text: nipples. His body tenses slightly. JEZZIE drops her robe. They enter
dialog: the shower together.
scene_heading: EXT. VIETNAM - NIGHT
text: A DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water. JACOB is
text: crawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese JUNGLE. His shirt is
text: bloodsoaked. He moves slowly, creeping on his right forearm. His left
text: arm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Help me. Someone.
text: Suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance. It dances
text: around the bamboo trees and draws closer to JACOB. It is impossible to
text: see who is carrying it. The light darts near the ground where JACOB is
text: lying and then bursts directly into his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APT. - DAY
text: SUNLIGHT pours through the BEDROOM window. JACOB is sleeping fitfully
text: as a bar of light saturates his face. His hand rushes up to cover and
text: protect his eyes but the damage is done. He is awake.
text: JACOB lies in bed for a few moments, dazed. Slowly his hand gropes
text: along the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for his glasses. He
text: has trouble finding them. As his hand sweeps blindly across the
text: headboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor. He
text: sits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out-of-focus
text: shelf behind him. Suddenly JEZZIE enters.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You up?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No. Have you seen my glasses?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Where'd you leave 'em?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Did you look around the headboard?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: Jezzie, I can't see.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (she scans the shelf)
dialog: Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
text: She leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a large paper
text: bag. She tosses them both onto the bed.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Thanks.
text: (he puts on his glasses
dialog: and notices the bag)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Your kid dropped it off.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Who? Jed?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (stooping to pick up the
dialog: phone)
dialog: No. The little one.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Eli. Why can't you remember their
dialog: names?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: They're weird names.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: They're Biblical. They were prophets.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Well, personally, I never went for
dialog: church names.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: And where do you think Jezebel comes
dialog: from?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I don't let anybody call me that.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: You're a real heathen, you know that,
dialog: Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get
dialog: involved with such a ninny?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You sold your soul, remember? That's
dialog: what you told me.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yeah, but for what?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: A good lay.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: And look what I got.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: The best.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I must have been out of my head.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Jake, you are never out of your head!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (ignoring the criticism
dialog: and reaching for the
dialog: paper bag)
dialog: What's in here?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss
dialog: 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em
text: over on his way to school.
text: JACOB lifts the bag and pours the photographs onto the bed. There are
text: hundreds of them. He examines them with growing delight.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Look at these, will ya? I don't
dialog: believe it. Jesus, these are
dialog: fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ...
dialog: And here's my brother, when we were
dialog: down in Florida.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Lemme see.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (rummaging excitedly
dialog: through the pile)
dialog: Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when
dialog: I was still at City College.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (looking closely)
dialog: That's Sarah?
dialog: (she studies the photo)
dialog: I can see what you mean.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Why you left.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What do you mean you can see?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Look at her face. A real bitch.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: She looked good then.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Not to me.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Well, you didn't marry her.
text: He digs through more photos. Suddenly he stops.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: What's wrong?
text: To JEZZIE's surprise and his own, tears well up in his eyes. For a
text: moment JACOB is unable to speak. He just stares at one of the photos.
text: JEZZIE looks at the picture. It is an image of JACOB carrying a small
text: child on his shoulders.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Is that the one who died?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Gabe.
text: JEZZIE is silent. JACOB grabs a Kleenex and blows his nose.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Sorry. it just took me by surprise. I
dialog: didn't expect to see him this morning
dialog: ... God, what I wouldn't ... He was
dialog: the cutest little guy. Like an angel,
dialog: you know. He had this smile ...
dialog: (choking up again)
dialog: Fuck, I don't even remember this
dialog: picture.
text: Hiding his emotions, JACOB scrambles over the bed and reaches for a
text: pair of pants. He pulls out his wallet and then carefully puts the
text: photo of GABE inside. It joins photos of his two other boys. JEZZIE
text: begins shoving the remaining pictures back into the paper bag.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Wait. Don't.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I don't like things that make you
dialog: cry.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I just want to look ...
text: He reaches into the pile for other snapshots. We see an array of frozen
text: moments, happy, unfocused, obscure. Suddenly he stops and stares at a
text: yellowing snapshot.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: God, this is me!
text: (he holds up a baby
dialog: photo)
dialog: Look. It's dated right after I was
dialog: born.
text: (he stares at it
dialog: intently)
dialog: What a kid. Cute, huh? So much
dialog: promise.
text: JEZZIE surveys the scene.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: It's amazing, huh Jake? Your whole
dialog: life ... right in front of you.
dialog: (she pauses before
dialog: making her final
dialog: pronouncement)
dialog: What a mess!
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: JEZZIE carries the garbage to an INCINERATOR ROOM down the hall. She is
text: carrying several bags. Two of them are tossed instantly down the chute.
text: She hesitates with the third. After a moment she reaches into it and
text: pulls out a handful of photos. They are pictures of JACOB and SARAH.
text: With cool deliberation she drops them down the chute. An apartment door
text: slams shut. Quickly she disposes of the pictures remaining in her hand.
text: JACOB opens the door to the tiny room as the bag filled with the
text: memories of his life falls to the fire below.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
text: JACOB and JEZZIE, both wearing postal uniforms, head for the ELEVATOR.
text: They are surprised that it has arrived promptly. JEZZIE reaches out and
text: playfully sticks her tongue into JACOB's ear. He pulls her into the
text: ELEVATOR. They disappear, laughing, behind its closing doors.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY
text: JACOB is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of midtown
text: Manhattan. As he drives he is humming to himself a rendition of Al
dialog: Jolson's "Sonny Boy."
text: JACOB stops his truck in front of a LAUNDRY on West 46th Street. He
text: opens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes toward him. He lifts
text: them with effort and slams the door with his foot. It doesn't close. He
text: considers giving it another whack but the boxes are heavy. He turns
text: instead and waddles toward the store.
scene_heading: INT. LAUNDRY - DAY
text: A heavyset WOMAN with a dark tan is standing behind a counter cluttered
text: with laundry. A picture of Richard Nixon is still stapled to the wall.
text: She looks at JACOB.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Where do you expect me to put those?
dialog: I don't have any room.
text: She tries clearing the counter, but it doesn't help.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How 'bout over there?
dialog: (she points to a table)
dialog: No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to
text: the back room.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: They're awfully heavy.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I know. That's why I'm asking.
text: JACOB waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store. CHINESE
text: LAUNDERERS are hovering over piles of clothes. Steam from the pressing
text: machines shoots into the air.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (huffing and puffing)
dialog: Where's Wong?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: That's what I'd like to know. If you
text: see him on the street somewhere, tell
text: him he's fired.
text: JACOB stoops to put the boxes on the shelf. There is a snapping sound
text: and he winces in pain. Massaging his back, JACOB unfolds some papers
dialog: for the WOMAN's signature.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How was Palm Springs?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hot. Where do I sign?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (pointing to the line)
dialog: You got a nice tan, though.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Tan? What tan? It faded on the
dialog: airplane. I'd try to get my money
dialog: back, but who do you ask?
dialog: (she looks heavenward)
dialog: Two hundred dollars a night, for
dialog: what?
text: She hands JACOB the wrong sheet.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No. I'll take the other one.
dialog: (he takes it)
dialog: Right. Well it's good to have you
dialog: back. See you tomorrow, probably.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: If you're lucky.
text: JACOB smiles to himself as he leaves the store. He walks carefully. His
text: back is out.
scene_heading: INT. MAIL TRUCK - DAY
text: ANGLE ON THE MAIL TRUCK stuck in traffic. Nothing is moving. Horns are
text: blaring and drivers are agitated. JACOB reaches for a newspaper lying
text: on top of his mail bags. To his shock one of the bags appears to move.
text: Curious, JACOB pokes at it. Instantly a terrifying figure pops out from
text: beneath it and stares at him with a frightening glare. JACOB jumps
text: back, stunned. It is a moment before he realizes that he is looking at
text: an old WINO who has been sleeping in the truck. The man's face is
text: covered in strange bumps.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Goddamn it! What the hell ... ?
speaker_heading: WINO
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: I didn't take nothin'. I was just
dialog: napping. Don't hit me. I was cold.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (lifting the man up)
dialog: What the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing? You can't do this. This is
dialog: government property.
text: He begins opening the door. The WINO begs.
speaker_heading: WINO
dialog: Don't throw me out. They're gonna get
dialog: me. They'll tear me to pieces.
text: He holds on to JACOB's leg. JACOB tries to pull away.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Come on. You can't stay here.
speaker_heading: WINO
dialog: Please! I never hurt anybody when I
dialog: was alive. Believe me. I don't belong
dialog: here.
text: JACOB gives the WINO a strange look and then escorts him from the
text: truck. A hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars and follow him as he
text: leads the WINO to the sidewalk. JACOB pulls a dollar bill from his
text: pocket and places it in the WINO's hand. The OLD MAN crumples it into a
text: ball and turns away. He has a frightened look on his face. JACOB
text: returns to the truck shaking his head.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: New York!
text: He climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view mirror. He
text: notices the WINO edging fearfully along the side of a building. A horn

dialog: longer there.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - DAY
text: JACOB drives his mail truck into the huge POST OFFICE PARKING GARAGE on
text: 34th Street. His mind seems distracted. He has difficulty parking.
scene_heading: INT. POST OFFICE - DAY
text: We see a vast room filled with hundreds of PEOPLE sorting and moving
dialog: mail.
text: JACOB, carrying a bag of McDonald's hamburgers, walks stiffly through
text: the aisles, his left hand rubbing his back. Several workers greet him
text: and grab for his french fries. He offers them around.
text: ANGLE ON a conveyor belt sorting mail. A hand reaches in, correcting
text: mistakes. Suddenly a hamburger passes by. JEZZIE looks up and smiles.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Jake!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How's it going?
text: She takes the hamburger and shrugs.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm going home.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't know. One of these days, I'm
dialog: gonna see Louis. My back's killing
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Now? What about the boss? He's not
dialog: gonna like it.
text: JACOB shrugs.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Well, I'll miss riding home with you.
dialog: I was looking forward to it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I enjoy crushing into you.
text: She grabs him and hugs him tightly.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Gently. My back.
text: JEZZIE ignores him and squeezes again.
scene_heading: INT. CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY
text: CUT ON A SCREAM to JACOB in a CHIROPRACTOR'S OFFICE. He is lying on a
text: long leather padded device that looks like an instrument of torture.
text: LOUIS, the Chiropractor, is a giant of a man, 280 pounds. He is
text: adjusting JACOB's spine.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I know you. How come you're so tense
dialog: today?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What can I tell you?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I saw Sarah the other day.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Her knee acting up?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: A bit.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What did she have to say?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Turn on your right side.
dialog: (he turns on his left)
dialog: How about the other "right?"
dialog: (JACOB turns back)
dialog: I don't understand you philosphers.
dialog: You've got the whole world figured
dialog: out but you can't remember the
dialog: difference between right and left.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I was absent the day they taught that
dialog: in school. What did she say?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Sarah.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Not much. She's like you that way.
dialog: Two clams. No wonder your marriage
dialog: didn't last. Put your hand under your
dialog: head. Take a breath and then let it
dialog: out.
text: He makes a rapid adjustment pushing down on JACOB's thigh. JACOB
text: groans.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: She talk about the boys?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: She says she can't get them new coats
dialog: because you haven't sent the alimony
dialog: for three months.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: She told you that?
dialog: (he shakes his head)
dialog: Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm
dialog: still paying for the orthodontist?
dialog: I'll bet she didn't mention that.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: She said you were a son of a bitch
dialog: and she regrets the day she set eyes
dialog: on you.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I thought you said she didn't say
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: She didn't. That's about all she
dialog: said. Put your hand up. Good. I think
dialog: she still loves you. Take a breath
dialog: and let it out.
text: He makes an adjustment. JACOB screams.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind
dialog: word about me in years!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Right. She doesn't stop talking about
dialog: you. You're always on her mind.
dialog: That's love, Jake.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: She hates me, Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You should go back to her.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What? She threw me out, remember. She
dialog: wanted some professor to carry her
dialog: far away from Brooklyn. Only we
dialog: didn't make it. She can't forgive me
dialog: that she still lives in the same
dialog: house she grew up in.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Her problem is that you spent eight
dialog: years getting a PhD and then went to
dialog: work for the post office.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam
dialog: I didn't want to think anymore. I
dialog: decided my brain was too small an
dialog: organ to comprehend this chaos.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: (looking at JACOB with
dialog: affection)
dialog: If it was any other brain but yours,
dialog: I might agree. Relax, this is going
dialog: to be strong.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I can't relax.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Wiggle your toes.
text: JACOB wiggles his toes. At that instant, LOUIS twists JACOB's neck
text: rapidly. There is a loud cracking sound.
scene_heading: EXT. VIETNAM - NIGHT
text: THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT. A MAN rushes at the camera yelling.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I found one. He's alive.
text: He shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and halos.
scene_heading: CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY
text: Suddenly LOUIS reappears, a halo effect still visible behind his head.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: God almighty. What did you do to me?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I had to get in there. A deep
dialog: adjustment. Rest a moment and let it
dialog: set a bit.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I had this weird flash just then.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't know. I've been having them
dialog: recently.
text: (he thinks a moment,
dialog: then changes the
dialog: subject)
dialog: You know, you look like an angel,
dialog: Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone
dialog: ever tell you that?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No
dialog: more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back
dialog: won't take it. You tell your girl
dialog: friend to calm down if she knows
dialog: what's good for you.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Louis, you're a life saver.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I know.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING
text: JACOB is walking down Nostrand Avenue. He is singing to himself and
dialog: imitating Al Jolson.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: When there are gray skies, I don't
dialog: mind the gray skies, as long as
dialog: there's you ...
text: He hums. It is near dusk and lights are just coming on. The shop
text: windows have a particularly garish look about them. The mannequins are
text: dressed in inexpensive, almost tawdry, clothes and have a pathetic
text: appearance. A few shops have set up their Christmas decorations.
text: The ornamentation seems strangely out of place; almost blasphemous.
text: JACOB passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a local drug
text: store. They chortle and make taunting sounds.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (shaking her tits,
dialog: singing)
dialog: "Hey, Mr. Postman ... "
text: JACOB stops and stares at them. To their surprise, he begins to sing
text: with them. He knows the words. They like that. It is a sweet moment.
text: JACOB continues walking. He comes to a cross street. The light is
text: green. He is still singing to himself and does not notice a BLACK CAR
text: sharging around the corner. The car is moving at full speed, heading
text: straight toward him. A YOUNG MAN walking a few steps behind yells out.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Look out!
text: JACOB turns and sees the car. He scoots out of the way but it swerves
text: in his direction. The YOUNG MAN calls out again.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Jump!
text: With a huge thrust, JACOB hurls himself onto the curb as the car shoots
text: by. Two MEN are peering at him from the back seat. They are laughing
text: like madmen and shaking their heads. They do not look human. JACOB
text: yells and waves his fist, to no effect. After a moment he turns to
text: thank the YOUNG MAN whose scream had saved him, but he is gone.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APT. - DUSK
text: JACOB and JEZZIE are lying in bed. They are a sensual couple and even
text: in quiet, reflective moments such as this, their positioning is erotic
text: and stimulating. Both of them are nude. JACOB's hands are clasped
text: behind his neck and he is staring mournfully at the ceiling. JEZZIE is
text: lying on her side, her left leg draped across JACOB's pelvis. Her head
text: is propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the bayonet
text: scar on JACOB's stomach. Neither are talking. Suddenly, out of the
text: blue, JEZZIE speaks.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake.
dialog: The money. Things like that. Or your
dialog: wife.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why do you bring her up?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: 'Cause she's always on your mind.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: When was the last time I said a word?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
text: She pauses for a while, long enough to suppose that the conversation is
text: over. Then she continues.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Or maybe it's the war.
text: JACOB closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's still there, Jake.
dialog: (she points to his
dialog: brain)
dialog: Even if you never say a word about
dialog: it. You can't spend two years in
dialog: Vietnam ...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: What does that have to do with
dialog: anything? Does it explain the
dialog: barricaded subway stations? Does it
dialog: explain those Godforsaken creatures?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
text: New York is filled with creatures.
dialog: Everywhere. And lots of stations are
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: They're like demons, Jez.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos
dialog: and bag ladies. Low life. That's all
text: they are. The streets are crawling
dialog: with 'em. Don't make em into
dialog: somethin' they're not.
dialog: (she rubs his forehead)
dialog: It's the pressure, honey. That's all
dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Those guys tried to kill me tonight.
dialog: They were aiming right at me.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: They weren't human!
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Come on. What were they, Jake?
text: JACOB doesn't answer. He turns over on his stomach. JEZZIE stares at
text: his naked back and drags her fingernails down to his buttocks. Scratch
text: marks follow in their wake.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You still love me?
text: He does not respond.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: JACOB and JEZZIE are sitting at the breakfast table. JEZZIE is reading
text: the National Enquirer and chewing at her lip. Suddenly a drop of blood
text: forms and falls onto the formica table top. Staring at it for a moment,
text: she wipes it with her finger and then licks it with her tongue.
text: JACOB is nursing a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the
text: housing project across the way. The toaster pops. JEZZIE jumps. She
text: gets up, butters her toast, and returns to her paper.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Says here the world's comin' to an
dialog: end. The battle of heaven and hell
dialog: they call it. Should be quite a show;
text: fireworks, H-bombs, and everything.
dialog: You believe them, Jake?
text: JACOB doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Me neither ... God, look at this. Two
dialog: heads. Only lived two days. A day for
dialog: each head. Could you imagine me with
dialog: two heads? We'd probably keep each
text: other up all night - arguing and
dialog: whatnot. You wanna see the picture?
text: He does not respond. JEZZIE gets up and walks over to JACOB. Standing
text: in front of him she slowly unties her robe and lets it fall apart. She
text: is naked underneath it. Sensuously she leans forward, unbuttons his
text: shirt, and strokes his chest. She waits for a response from him, but
text: there is none. He sits silently, disinterested.
text: Furious, JEZZIE turns away. Grabbing the vacuum cleaner from the broom
text: closet she angrily unravels the cord and switches it on. Breasts flash
text: from beneath her gown as the vacuum roars back and forth across the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Goddamn you son-of-a-bitch! My
dialog: uncle's dogs used to treat me better
dialog: than you do. At least they'd lick my
dialog: toes once in a while. At least they
dialog: showed some fucking interest.
text: A NEIGHBOR bangs on the wall, shouting.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: All right! All right! All right!
text: JACOB peers at the courtyard eighteen stories below and watches the
text: patterns of early morning movement. Tiny figures drift purposefully
text: over the concrete.
text: Suddenly the vasuum cleaner goes off. In the silence, JACOB realizes
text: that JEZZIE is crying and turns to see her curled over the kitchen
text: table. He walks to her side and strokes her hair. JEZZIE begins to sob.
text: After a moment she looks at him with puffy eyes.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You love me?
text: He nods his head "yes." She smiles coyly and rubs her hair like a
text: kitten against his crotch. After a few moments she speaks.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Della's party's tonight. Why don't we
dialog: go? It'll take your minf offa things.
dialog: And I won't make you dance. I
dialog: promise. Huh?
text: (he nods his head in
text: consent. JEZZIE hugs
dialog: him)
dialog: You still love me, Jake?
text: He nods his head again, only heavily, as though the question exhausts
dialog: him.
scene_heading: INT. BELLVUE HOSPITAL - DAY
text: JACOB is in the "Mental Health Clinic" at BELLVUE HOSPITAL walking
text: through the PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM. It is overflowing with people.
text: Some are handcuffed to their chairs. POLICEMEN are with them. JACOB
text: approaches the main RECEPTION DESK. He speaks nervously.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Carlson? Is he new here?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: New? He's been here for years.
text: She shrugs and looks at a log book.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Not according to my charts. Do you
dialog: have an appointment?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Look, I need to see him. I know where
dialog: his room is. Just give me a pass. I
dialog: won't be long. Ten minutes.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Our doctors are seen by appointment
dialog: only.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Damn it. I was in the veteran's out-
dialog: patient program. He knows me.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: (not happy)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jacob Singer.
text: She walks over to a file drawer and goes through it several times
text: before coming back over to JACOB.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I'm sorry but there's no record of a
dialog: Jacob Singer in our files.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Whataya mean, no record?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: You want me to spell it out? There's
dialog: nothing here.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That's ridiculous. I've been coming
dialog: here for years. Listen to me. I'm
dialog: going out of my fucking mind here. I
dialog: need to see him.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: If this is an emergency we have a
dialog: staff of psychiatric social workers.
dialog: There's about an hour's wait. I'll be
dialog: glad to take your name. Why don't you
dialog: just fill out this form?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Goddamn it! I don't want a social
dialog: worker. Carlson knows me.
text: JACOB pounds the desk, rattling a tiny African violet and knocking the
text: RECEPTIONIST's forms to the floor. She grunts angrily and stoops to
text: retrieve them. Standing up her cap hits a drawer handle and slips off.
text: TWO KNUCKLE-LIKE HORNS protrude from her skull where the cap had been.
text: JACOB's eyes lock on them like radar. He backs away. She immediately
text: replaces her cap and breaks the spell, but her eyes glare at him with
text: demonic intensity. JACOB, freaked, angry, turns and runs toward the "In
dialog: Patient" door.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Hey! You can't go in there!
text: JACOB doesn't stop. A POLICEMAN, guarding the entrance, runs after him.
text: JACOB charges through the interior corridors of the aging institution.
text: A LINE OF MENTAL PATIENTS, all holding hands, is moving down the hall.
text: They break ranks as he charges by and begin to scream. Their ATTENDANT
text: tries to calm them down but the sight of the POLICEMAN increases their
text: hysteria. They grab hold of him as he tries to get by.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: LET GO! GET AWAY!
scene_heading: INT. GROUP ROOM - DAY
text: JACOB dashes out of view. He runs down another corridor, wildly
text: searching for a specific room. He finds it and rushes inside. He is
text: surprised to find A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN seated in a circle. They all
text: look up at him.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't
dialog: this his office?
text: The LEADER stares at him uncomfortably. After a moment he gets up and
text: takes JACOB into a corner of the room. Everyone is watching them. The
text: LEADER speaks quietly.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't
dialog: ... Dr. Carlson died.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Died?
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: A car accident.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Last month, before Thanksgiving.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How did it happen?
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: No one knows. They say it blew up.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (growing pale)
dialog: Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
text: The LEADER shrugs and tries to put his arm around JACOB, but he pulls
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Do you want me to get someone?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
text: He backs quickly to the door. As he turns to leave he realizes that all
text: of the PEOPLE in the group are watching him intently.
text: Unsettled, JACOB hurries back into the hallway. He is frightened and
text: confused. Suddenly a voice calls out.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: HEY YOU! MAILMAN!
text: JACOB turns and sees the POLICEMAN waiting for him. His gun is drawn.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Hold it. Just hold it. Where the hell
dialog: do you think you are? This is
dialog: Bellevue, for God's sake. People
dialog: running around here get shot.
text: The GROUP LEADER pokes his head out of the door and motions to the
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: It's alright. He's okay.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: (nodding, reholstering
dialog: his gun)
dialog: Come on, get out of here. I wouldn't
dialog: want to interfere with the U.S. Mail.
text: He leads JACOB toward the lobby. JACOB does not look back.
scene_heading: INT. DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT
text: WE HEAR LOUD DANCE MUSIC. SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE. JACOB is with some
text: POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES at a crowded party in a small apartment. A DRUNK
text: is telling a bad joke and trying to hold a glass of wine at the same
text: time. It is constantly on the verge of spilling. JACOB is fixated on
text: it. In the background, we see JEZZIE dancing and motioning for JACOB to
text: join her. He nods no. The DRUNK, who keeps asking people if they "get
text: it," takes JACOB's head nodding as a sign of confusion and keeps trying
dialog: to re-explain the joke.
text: JACOB hears a strange noise and looks around. It seems to be coming
text: from a covered bird cage. He goes over to it and lifts the cover. The
text: BIRD is flapping its wings wildly as if trying to get out. The sound,
text: loud and insistent, startles him. He lowers the cover.
text: In the DINING ROOM, several people are gathered around ELSA, an
text: attractive black woman who is reading palms. She sees JACOB and calls
text: over the music.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Hey, you! Let me look at your hand!
text: JACOB shrugs. DELLA, dancing nearby, calls out.
speaker_heading: DELLA
dialog: Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a
dialog: book.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No, thanks.
speaker_heading: DELLA
dialog: It's fun.
text: CUT TO A CLOSE UP OF JACOB'S HAND. ELSA is squeezing the mounds and
text: examining the lines. What begins as a playful expression on her face
text: turns suddenly serious. She reaches for his other hand and compares the
text: two of them. JEZZIE looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene
text: jealously.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: You have an unusual hand.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I could have told you that.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: You see this line here? It's your
dialog: life line. Here's where you were
dialog: born. And this is where you got
dialog: married. You're a married man, huh?
dialog: Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
text: She studies his life line with growing concern. JEZZIE tries to get
text: JACOB's attention. He ignores her.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know, you got a strange line
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (examining it)
dialog: It's short, huh?
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Short? It's ended.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Oh, terrific.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: It's not funny. According to this ...
dialog: you're already dead.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Just my luck.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE DANCERS. Their movements are loose and getting looser. The music is
text: strong and insistent. The smokey atmosphere disfigures the dancers and
text: gives them a strange, distorted appearance. Suddenly JEZZIE breaks from
text: the crowd and reaches for JACOB. He pulls away. Some of the MALE
text: DANCERS call out to him.
speaker_heading: DANCERS
dialog: Come on man, show your stuff.
text: JACOB is easily intimidated. Relenting, he glares at JEZZIE and nods
text: apologetically to ELSA. It is obvious that he is embarrassed at his
text: inadequacy on the dance floor.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Come on professor. You got feet, too.
text: JACOB tries to smile but it is pained and unconvincing. JEZZIE is
text: playing with him, mimicking his movement. A number of DANCERS notice
text: and laugh, which only increases his discomfort. JEZZIE's taunting has a
text: strange effect on JACOB. He grows distant and withdrawn, even though
text: his body is still going through the motions of the dance.
text: A MAN taps JEZZIE on the shoulder. She spins around, smiling, and
text: begins dancing with him. JACOB is left alone, dancing by himself. He
text: looks away, uncomfortable.
text: In the shadows a WOMAN kneels close to the floor. She seems to be
text: urinating on the carpet. JACOB is shocked. Several DANCERS obscure his
text: view. He turns around.
text: A PREGNANT WOMAN stands half naked in the kitchen. JACOB cannot believe
text: what he sees.
text: In the next room, past JEZZIE, JACOB glimpses a terrifying image, a MAN
text: whose head seems to be vibrating at such enormous speed that it has
text: lost all definition. Something about the image compels and frightens
text: JACOB. Slowly he approaches it. As he draws nearer to it the tortured
text: image lets out a scream of such pain and unearthly terror that JACOB
text: backs away.
text: A WOMAN, laughing, grabs JACOB, spins him around, and begins dancing
text: with him. He is totally disoriented.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hold me, baby!
text: She takes JACOB's arm and guides it to her back. THE CAMERA follows his
text: hand as it reaches the smooth skin beneath her sexy, loose fitting
text: dress. He runs his fingers up to her shoulder blades. Then, suddenly,
text: he recoils. Her back is a mass of shoulder blades, hundreds of strange,
text: bony protrusions. JACOB gasps. Out of the blue, JEZZIE leans into him
text: and wiggles her tongue in his ear. JACOB, startled, jerks his head and
text: his glasses go flying to the floor.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Shit!
text: He stoops down blindly to pick them up. Shoes just miss his fingers as
text: he digs between dancing legs trying to recover them. Miraculously, he
text: grabs the spectacles just before they are crushed and slips them back
text: on. Instantly his world comes back into focus.
text: As he stands, JACOB is surprised to find JEZZIE facing him, gyrating in
text: wild abandon. There is a huge, satisfied smile on her face. She grabs
text: his hand as if encouraging him to dance but it is obvious that she is
text: dancing to her own rhythm. JACOB stares at her, confused. It takes him
text: a moment to realize that her smile is not for him.
text: Standing behind JEZZIE is another DANCER, his hands around her waist.
text: They are moving together, locked in erotic embrace. It appears that he
text: is mounting her from behind. Looking down we see that the DANCER's feet
text: are deformed. They have a bizarre clubbed appearance and look very much
text: like hooves. They skid and careen amidst the dancing feet.
text: Something horrible and winglike flaps behind JEZZIE's back. We cannot
text: make out what it is, but it elicits a primal terror. Before JACOB can
text: react, JEZZIE opens her mouth. With a roaring sound, a spiked horn
text: erupts from her throat. It juts menacingly from between her teeth and
text: thrusts into the air. A CIRCLE OF DANCERS scream out in excited
dialog: approval.
text: CUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He stares at
text: the DANCERS who are crowding around him. They have become perverse,
dialog: corrupt aspects of their normal selves.
text: JACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from his head
text: but it won't go away. The music throbs. His actions become spastic,
text: almost delirious.
text: JACOB is out of control. His frenzy becomes a kind of exorcism, a
text: desperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind. WE MOVE
text: IN ON HIM as his eyes pass beyond pain. The dark walls of the APARTMENT
text: fade away.
scene_heading: EXT. VIETNAM - NIGHT
text: Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness, outlined by a
text: bright moon that is emerging from behind a cloud. The faces are looking
text: down and voices are speaking.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: He's burning up.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Total delirium.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That's some gash. His guts keep
text: spilling out.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Push 'em back.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: Help me!
text: His eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emenate from it filling the
text: sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw us forward with a
text: quickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed. The rush
text: causes them to flash stroboscopically and produces a dazzling, almost
text: sensual, surge of color. The display is spectacular and compelling.
text: Music can be heard in the distance, growing hard and insistent, like a
text: heart beat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The stroboscopic
text: flashes are replaced by intense flashes of red and blue light. The
text: music grows louder and reaches a thundering crescendo. Then silence.
scene_heading: INT. DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT
text: The APARTMENT reappears in all its normalcy. The neon sign is still
text: flashing outside the window. DANCERS are smiling and sweating.
text: Cheers and applause ring out for JACOB and JEZZIE but JACOB barely
text: hears them. JEZZIE hugs him tightly. PEOPLE smack him on the back.
speaker_heading: ADMIRER
dialog: You are out of your mind, man. Out of
dialog: your fuckin' mind.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Jake, you little devil. You never
dialog: told me you could dance like that.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Jezzie, what did you put in his
dialog: drink?
text: JEZZIE smiles while pulling JACOB to a corner chair. He plops down. His
text: chest is heaving and he is grabbing hold of his stomach. Hie face is
text: frightened and distorted.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Oh, come on. It's early.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (pulling JEZZIE close to
text: him, his voice filled
dialog: with paranoia)
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (surprised by the
dialog: question)
dialog: We're at Della's.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: What do you mean? Where do you think?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where's Della? Bring her here?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Why? What for?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Show me Della!
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Hey, I'm here.
text: JACOB eyes her with a pleading look. Annoyed, JEZZIE leaves JACOB and
text: crosses the room. He watches her as she goes. JACOB is holding his
text: stomach and rocking painfully. Moments later JEZZIE returns with DELLA.
speaker_heading: DELLA
dialog: Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (staring at her closely)
dialog: Della?
speaker_heading: DELLA
dialog: (feeling the
dialog: strangeness)
dialog: You want to see me? Well, here I am.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: DELLA
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Just to see you. That's all.
speaker_heading: DELLA
dialog: (a bit uncomfortable)
dialog: Well, how do I look?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Like Della.
text: Suddenly JACOB breaks out in a dense sweat and begins shaking. His
text: entire body is convulsive.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Are you feeling all right? Shit,
dialog: you're burning up. Feel his forehead.
speaker_heading: DELLA
dialog: (checking his forehead
dialog: and cheeks)
dialog: Damn, that's hot. Maybe from dancing.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I think you should lie down.
text: JACOB is shaking uncontrollably. People are gathering around.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Can't you stop it?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Is he sick?
speaker_heading: DELLA
text: He's on fire.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Let me help you.
text: She reaches out to JACOB. Unexpectedly he recoils, jumping to his feet
text: like a wild man. He begins to scream.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Stay away from me! Don't you come
dialog: near me! All of you. Go to hell! Go
dialog: to hell, goddamn you! Stay away!
text: JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a confused and embarrassed look. A MAN
text: whispers to her.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'll call a cab.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT
text: JACOB is lying in bed in his own BEDROOM with a thermometer in his
text: mouth. JEZZIE is pacing the floor with great agitation.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I've never been so mortified in my
dialog: whole life. Never! Screaming like
dialog: that. I don't understand what's
dialog: gotten into you, Jake, to make you do
dialog: a thing like that. You're not acting
dialog: normal. I've lived with too many
dialog: crazies in my life. I don't want it
dialog: anymore. I can't handle it. I'm tired
dialog: of men flipping out on me. Shit,
dialog: you'd think it was my fault. Well you
dialog: picked me, remember that. I don't
dialog: need this.
text: The NEIGHBOR pounds on the wall.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: All right! All right!
text: JEZZIE jabs her finger at the wall.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: If you go crazy on me you're goin'
dialog: crazy by yourself. You understand?
text: JEZZIE reaches for his mouth and pulls out the thermometer. She looks
text: at it closely and then squints to see it better.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's it say? A hundred and two?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I don't believe this. I'm calling the
dialog: doctor.
text: She runs out of the room. JACOB calls after her.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What does it say?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE (V.O.)
text: It's gone to the top.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How high is that?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE (V.O.)
text: The numbers stop at 107.
text: JEZZIE is on the phone to the doctor in the next room.
text: JACOB begins shaking again and reaches for the extra blanket at the
text: foot of the bed. He pulls it up around his shoulders. The whole bed
text: vibrates with his shivering. Suddenly JEZZIE rushes through the BEDROOM
text: and into the BATHROOM. SHe turns on the bath water.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What the hell are you doin'?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Get your clothes off.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What are you talking about? I'm
dialog: freezing.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Get your clothes off!
text: JACOB gives her a confused look as she rushes back to the KITCHEN.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What'd the doctor say?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE (V.O.)
dialog: That you'd die on the way to the
dialog: hospital. Now get into that tub.
text: JACOB stares at her as she bursts back into the BEDROOM carrying four
text: trays of ice cubes. She hurries into the BATHROOM and dumps them in the
dialog: tub.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE (V.O.)
text: He's coming right over.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Coming here?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE (V.O.)
dialog: Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't
text: stand around waiting.
text: She rushes out of the BATHROOM and pulls JACOB out of bed. He is
text: shaking violently and she has difficulty navigating across the room and
text: undressing him at the same time. She maneuvers him into the BATHROOM
text: next to the tub. He looks down at the ice cubes floating in the water.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You're out of your mind. I'm not
dialog: getting in there. I'd rather die.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: That's your decision.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Look at me. I'm ice cold.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You're red hot, damn it. Get in
dialog: there. I've got to get more ice.
text: She runs out of the room. The door to the apartment slams shut. JACOB
text: sticks his toe into the water and pulls it out again instantly.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh Jesus!
text: He sticks his whole foot in and grits his teeth as the ice cold water
text: turns his foot bright red. He keeps it in as long as he can and then
text: yanks it out, quickly wrapping it in a towel. JACOB rubs his foot
text: vigorously to get rid of the sting and stares at the water, afraid of
dialog: its pain.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: JEZZIE is running up and down the CORRIDOR knocking on doors and
text: collecting ice cubes from those who will answer. She hurries back to
text: the BATHROOM with several PEOPLE behind her carrying additional ice
text: trays. One of the MEN is shifting the trays in his hands to avoid the
text: burning cold.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S BATHROOM
text: As JEZZIE enters the BATHROOM, JACOB is sitting on the rim of the tub
text: with the water up to his calves, shivering vigorously.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I can't do it.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: What kind of man are you?
text: She unloads two trays into the water.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Don't gimme that.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Lie down!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Sam, Tony, come in here.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hey, I'm not dressed.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You got nothin' we ain't seen before.
text: SAM and TONY grab hold of JACOB who wrestles to get away.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Get the hell off me.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: He's like a hot coal.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's for your own good, Jake.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Let go of me, you sons of bitches.
text: The TWO MEN struggle with JACOB and force him into the water. TONY
text: winces when the water hits his arm. JACOB nearly flies out of the tub.
text: The TWO MEN fight to hold him down. JACOB screams and cries for the MEN
text: to let him go but they keep him flat on his back.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm freezing! I'm freezing! Goddamn
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (his hand turning red)
dialog: Sam, I can't take it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Don't you let go.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Jez, get help. My hands are killing
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Help me! Help me!
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
speaker_heading: (to TONY)
dialog: Here. I'll do it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Take his legs.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Run your hands under hot water.
text: MRS. CARMICHAEL comes in.
scene_heading: MRS. CARMICHAEL
dialog: I have some ice from the machine.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Bring it in.
scene_heading: MRS. CARMICHAEL
dialog: Is he all right?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: He doesn't like it.
scene_heading: MRS. CARMICHAEL
dialog: I don't blame him. What should I do
dialog: with the ice?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Pour it in.
scene_heading: MRS. CARMICHAEL
dialog: On top of him?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: He's melting it as fast as we dump it
dialog: in.
scene_heading: MRS. CARMICHAEL
dialog: Okay. My husband's got two more bags.
text: He's coming. They're heavy.
text: TONY helps her pour the ice into the water. JACOB yells.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh God! You're killing me! Stop!
scene_heading: INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: CUT TO JACOB lying in a BEDROOM we have not seen before. He is tossing
text: and turning in his bed as though struggling to get out. Suddenly he
text: sits up and looks over at the window. It is open and the shade is
text: flapping. Cold air is blowing in and he is shivering.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Damn! You and your fresh air.
text: He jumps out of bed and goes over to the window. He pushes at the frame
text: and it comes flying down with a loud bang. A woman in the bed sits up.
speaker_heading: It is SARAH.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: It's freezing.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm not cold.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Of course not. You have all the
dialog: blankets. It must be ten degrees in
dialog: here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you
dialog: want to sleep with fresh air, you
dialog: sleep on the fire escape. From now on
text: that window is closed.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's not healthy with it closed.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: This is healthy? I'll probably die of
dialog: pneumonia tomorrow and this is
dialog: healthy.
text: He settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to his side. He
text: lies quietly for a moment, thinking.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What a dream I was having. I was
dialog: living with another woman ... You
dialog: know who it was?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don't want to know.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jezebel, from the post office. You
dialog: remember, you met her that time at
dialog: the Christmas party. I was living
dialog: with her. God, it was a nightmare.
dialog: There were all these demons and I was
dialog: on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Guilty thoughts. See what happens
dialog: when you cheat on me, even in your
dialog: mind?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: She was good in bed, though.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Go to sleep.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: She had these real beefy thighs.
dialog: Delicious.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I thought you said it was a
dialog: nightmare?
text: Suddenly, out of nowhere, we hear the tinkling sound of a music box. A
text: YOUNG BOY enters the room, carrying a musical LUNCH BOX in his arms. He
text: is wearing a long T-shirt nearly down to his ankles. We recognize him
text: from his photograph. It is GABE.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Daddy, what was that noise?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (surprised to see him)
dialog: Gabe?
text: (he stares curiously at
dialog: his son)
dialog: What are you doing ... ?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: There was a bang.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It was the window.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: It's cold.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Tell your mother.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Mom, it's ...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I heard you. Go back to sleep.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Will you tuck me in?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (not happily)
dialog: Oh ... all right.
text: She starts to rise. JACOB stops her and gets up instead. He whisks GABE
text: upside down and carries him into his
scene_heading: GABE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: BEDROOM, licking his belly and tickling him all the way. GABE laughs
text: and snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits the bed. JED, 9, and
text: ELI, 7, are both in bunk beds across the room. JED looks up.
speaker_heading: JED
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: Jed. It's the middle of the night.
dialog: (he kisses GABE and goes
text: over to JED in the lower
dialog: bunk)
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: JED
dialog: You forgot my allowance.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Your allowance? It's five A.M. We'll
dialog: talk at breakfast.
speaker_heading: JED
dialog: Okay, but don't forget.
text: Suddenly another voice pipes in from the top bunk.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I love you, Dad.
text: JACOB smiles.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What is this, a convention? I love
dialog: you, too, Pickles. Now go back to
dialog: sleep.
text: He turns to leave.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Wait ... Daddy.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Don't go.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Don't go?
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: I'm not going anywhere. I'm right
dialog: here, Gabe.
text: (he looks at his son
dialog: tenderly)
dialog: Come on, go back to sleep. You can
dialog: still get a couple of hours.
text: He hugs him warmly and then walks to the door.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: ... I love you.
text: There is deep emotion and seriousness in GABE's words. JACOB is struck
dialog: by them.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Don't shut the door.
text: JACOB nods and leaves it a tiny bit ajar.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: A bit more ... a bit more.
text: JACOB adjusts the opening enough to please GABE and make him secure.
text: GABE smiles and cuddles in his bed.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: JACOB settles back into bed. SARAH turns over and gets comfortable.
text: JACOB lies on his back facing the ceiling. He pulls the blankets up to
text: his neck. He is overcome with feelings of sadness and longing.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I love you, Sarah.
text: She smiles warmly. His eyes close and in a matter of seconds he is back
dialog: asleep.
scene_heading: EXT. VIETNAM - PRE DAWN
text: WE HEAR SUMMER MORNING SOUNDS, CRICKETS and BIRDS. The image of trees
text: materializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky, just before sunrise,
text: can be seen through the branches. It is an idyllic setting.
text: Suddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a metallic
text: humming, growing louder. There is a scramble of feet and a sound of
text: heavy boots moving through the tall grass. Voices can be heard. Men's
dialog: voices.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: They're here.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Thank God. Move 'em out!
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Bust your balls!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Move it! Move it!
text: There is an instant swell of activity. Trees and branches blur and
text: speed by overhead. The idyllic image of moments before reveals itself
text: as a P.O.V. SHOT. The CAMERA races out of a JUNGLE covering and into a
text: huge CLEARING.
text: High overhead a helicopter appears. Its blades whirl with a deafening
text: whine. Long lines drop from its belly and dangle in mid-air. SOLDIERS
text: leap up into the air reaching for them. The air is filled with
text: turbulence. Tarps fly off dead bodies. SOLDIERS hold them down. Voices
text: yell but the words are not clear. They are filled with urgency.
text: The CAMERA leaves the ground. The edges of the sky disappear as the
text: helicopter's gray mass fills the frame. It grows larger and darker as
text: the CAMERA approaches. Rivets and insignias dotting the underbelly come
text: into view. Suddenly the stretcher begins spinning, out of control.
text: Hands emerge from inside, reaching out to grab it.
text: Watery, womb-like sounds rise out of nowhere, the rippling of water, a
text: heart beating. Gradually voices can be heard mumbling; distant sounds,
text: warm and familiar.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: JACOB's DOCTOR reaches down to help him out of the tub. Surprisingly
text: JEZZIE and MRS. CARMICHAEL are standing there too. JACOB stares at them
text: in total confusion.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You are a lucky man, my friend. A
dialog: lucky man. You must have friends in
dialog: high places, that's all I can say.
text: SAM and TONY appear next to the DOCTOR. They are extending their hands
text: to the P.O.V. CAMERA. JACOB'S arms, nearly blue, reach out to them.
text: Slowly they lift him from the icy water. JACOB takes one step onto the
text: tile and collapses to the floor.
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK:
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: FADE IN sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet. A glass rattles on
text: a tray. A television is on low in the background. Slowly the CAMERA
text: LENS opens from JACOB's P.O.V. and we see JEZZIE puttering around the
text: BEDROOM. Suddenly she is aware that JACOB is watching her. She smiles.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Jake.
text: (she places her hand on
text: his head and strokes his
dialog: hair)
dialog: You're gonna be all right, Jake.
dialog: You're gonna be fine.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Am I home?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You're here. Home. The doctor said
dialog: you're lucky your brains didn't boil.
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You
dialog: kept sayin' "Sarah, close the
dialog: window," over and over. And talkin'
dialog: to your kids. Even the dead one.
dialog: Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds
dialog: of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Are we in Brooklyn?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You're right here, Jake. You just
dialog: rest.
dialog: (she puffs up his
dialog: pillow)
dialog: The doctor said you had a virus.
dialog: That's what they say when they don't
dialog: know what it is. You can't do
dialog: anything for a week. He says you
dialog: gotta recuperate.
dialog: (she strokes his
dialog: forehead, and gets up)
dialog: Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman
dialog: made you some chicken soup. It'll
dialog: warm you up.
text: JEZZIE leaves the room. JACOB watches her as she goes. He seems lost
text: and confused.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: JACOB, unshaven, wearing his bathrobe, is sitting at the KITCHEN TABLE.
text: PILES OF BOOKS on demonology are spread out before him. He studies them
text: to distraction. JEZZIE is standing by the counter making sandwiches.
text: She wraps them in plastic Baggies and puts one in a lunch box, another
text: in the refrigerator. She is dressed in her postal uniform.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You know, you really ought to get out
dialog: today. You can't just sit around like
dialog: this all the time. It's not healthy.
dialog: It's not good for your mind. Go take
dialog: a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie.
dialog: Christ, who's gonna know? You think I
dialog: care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy
dialog: yourself. One of us should be having
dialog: a good time.
speaker_heading: (JEZZIE knocks on
speaker_heading: JACOB's head)
dialog: Hello! Anybody home?
dialog: (she looks in his ear)
dialog: Anybody in there?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What?
text: JEZZIE just stares at him. She does not respond. JACOB returns to his
dialog: books.
text: CUT TO CLOSE UP IMAGES OF WINGED DEMONS, real demons, with spindly
text: horns and long tails. JACOB's huge finger, magnified, scans page after
text: page of ancient images and archaic text. JEZZIE, enraged at his lack of
text: attention, returns to packing her lunch box. Suddenly she spins around.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Goddamn it! I can't stand it anymore.
dialog: I've had it up to here. Go ahead and
dialog: rot if you want ... You son-of-a-
dialog: bitch, I'm talking to you.
text: CUT BACK to the DEMONS. Suddenly a crashing sound catches JACOB's
text: attention as a KITCHEN POT flies by his head. He looks up to see JEZZIE
text: knocking pots and pans off the kitchen counter and kicking them wildly
text: across the room. The noise is terrible. The intensity of her rage is
text: shocking. The pots crash into every surface, knocking all his books
text: onto the floor. And then, suddenly, she stops.
text: JEZZIE stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich, stuffs it
text: back in its plastic Baggie, and puts it back in her lunch box. She is
text: about to leave when she stops and looks at JACOB.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing, her anger
dialog: in check)
dialog: I made you a tuna fish sandwich. It's
text: in the fridge. Eat a carrot with it.
text: The aspirin's on the bottom shelf.
dialog: We're out of soap so, if for some
dialog: reason you decide to wash yourself
dialog: again, use the dishwashing stuff.
text: (she walks out of the
dialog: room and returns with
dialog: her coat)
dialog: I'm sorry I yelled, but you get on my
dialog: nerves.
text: (she bends down and
dialog: makes eye contact with
speaker_heading: JACOB)
dialog: Hello? Listen, I gotta go.
text: JEZZIE sits on his lap, gives him a big kiss, and then, unexpectedly,
text: raises two fingers, like horns, over her head. The gesture catches
text: JACOB's full attention.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.
dialog: (she kisses his cheek)
dialog: Love me a little?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (speaking with
dialog: affection)
dialog: You are the most unbelievable woman I
dialog: have ever met. One second you're a
dialog: screaming banshee and the next you're
dialog: Florence Nightingale. Who are you?
dialog: That's what I want to know. Will the
dialog: real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
text: Suddenly the telephone rings. It startles them.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Oh shit. Tell 'em I've left.
text: JEZZIE grabs her jacket and shoves her arm in it upside down. A
text: pocketful of change falls on the floor. JACOB smiles. JEZZIE curses as
text: she struggles to pick it up and get the jacket on right. JACOB gets the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.)
dialog: Jacob Singer?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Speaking.
speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.)
dialog: Paul Gruneger!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be
dialog: goddamned!
text: JACOB indicates it's for him. JEZZIE throws him a kiss goodbye and
text: hurries out the door.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the
dialog: hell are you? I haven't seen you in
dialog: what, five, six, years?
speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.)
dialog: A long time.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's
dialog: happening in your life?
speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.)
dialog: Nothin' much.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So
dialog: tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.)
dialog: I need to see you, Jake.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But
dialog: I'm kind of laid up here. I've been
dialog: sick.
speaker_heading: PAUL (V.O.)
dialog: I need to see you.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL'S CAR - DAY
text: JACOB and PAUL are driving through EAST NEW YORK heading toward
text: WILLIAMSBURG. The elevated trains rumble above them. JACOB pats PAUL on
dialog: the back.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jesus, man, you look terrific. You
dialog: must have put on twenty pounds.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I work in a bakery.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You're lucky. How many vets you know
dialog: are even employed?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Count 'em on one hand.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn
dialog: war. I'm still fightin' it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's not worth it. You'll never win.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You tellin' me? How many times can
dialog: you die, huh?
text: PAUL looks in his rear view mirror before changing lanes. He sees a
text: black car tagging close behind him. He pulls out. So does the car.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Still married, Jake?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You and everybody else. God I hate
dialog: this area. Makes me nervous.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why the hell we drivin' here?
speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You can't talk in Brownsville?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm not sure where I can talk
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Let's get a couple drinks, okay?
text: (he looks at his rear
dialog: view mirror)
dialog: Hey, take a look behind us. Do you
dialog: think that car is followin' us?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (turning to look)
dialog: That black car?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Pull the mirror down on the sun
dialog: visor.
speaker_heading: (JACOB does)
dialog: Just watch 'em.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's goin' on Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You in trouble?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah.
text: JACOB notices PAUL's left arm. It is shaking. The black car passes on
text: the left. Both PAUL and JACOB stare at it as it speeds by.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - DAY
text: JACOB and PAUL are sitting in a dark booth in an obscure WILLIAMSBURG
text: BAR. It is nearly empty. PAUL is leaning across the table in a very
dialog: intimate fashion.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Somethin's wrong, Jake. I don't know
dialog: what it is but I can't talk to
dialog: anybody about it. I figured I could
dialog: with you. You always used to listen,
dialog: you know?
text: JACOB nods. PAUL takes a sip of his drink and stares deliberately into
text: JACOB's eyes.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm going to Hell!
text: JACOB's face grows suddenly tense.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: That's as straight as I can put it.
dialog: And don't tell me that I'm crazy
dialog: 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to
dialog: Hell. They're comin' after me.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (frightened, but holding
dialog: back)
dialog: Who is?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: They've been followin' me. They're
dialog: comin' outta the walls. I don't trust
dialog: anyone. I'm not even sure I trust
dialog: you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm
dialog: gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
text: PAUL cannot contain his fear. He jumps up suddenly and walks away from
text: the booth. JACOB follows him with his eyes but does not go after him. A
text: YOUNG MAN in the next booth observes the scene with interest. He looks
text: vaguely familiar, like we have seen him before.
text: PAUL stares out the window for a moment and then walks over to the juke
text: box. He pulls a quarter out of his pocket and drops it in the slot. His
text: finger pushes a selection at random. Some '60's rock hit blares out.
text: JACOB's mind is reeling by the time PAUL sits back down.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just
dialog: gonna jump outta my skin. They're
dialog: just drivin' me wild.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't know who they are, or what
dialog: they are. But they're gonna get me
dialog: and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I
dialog: can't do anything. I can't go to my
dialog: sisters. I can't even go home.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: They're waitin' for me, that's why.
text: PAUL's hand starts to shake. The tremor spreads rapidly to his whole
text: body. The booth begins to rattle.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I can't stop it. I try. Oh God! Help
dialog: me Jake.
text: JACOB slides quickly out of his side of the booth and moves in toward
text: PAUL. He puts his arm around him and holds him tightly, offering
dialog: comfort as best he can.
text: PAUL is obviously terrified and grateful for JACOB's gesture. A few
text: PEOPLE at the bar look over in their direction.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (crying)
dialog: I don't know what to do.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Don't do anything.
text: (PAUL begins to relax a
dialog: bit and the shaking
dialog: subsides)
dialog: Paul, I know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I've seen them too ... the demons!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (staring at JACOB)
dialog: You've seen them?
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: Everywhere, like a plague.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: God almighty. I thought I was the
dialog: only one.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I
text: was coming apart at the seams.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh God. I know. I know.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What is it Paul? What's happening to
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: They keep telling me I'm already
dialog: dead, that they're gonna tear me
dialog: apart, piece by piece, and throw me
text: into the fire.
text: (he fumbles in his coat
text: pocket and pulls out a
dialog: small Bible and silver
dialog: cross)
dialog: I carry these everywhere but they
dialog: don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone
dialog: thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a
dialog: report with the army.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: The army?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She said I haven't been the same
dialog: since then. Since that night. There's
dialog: still this big hole in my brain. It's
dialog: so dark in there, Jake. And these
dialog: creatures. It's like they're crawling
dialog: out of my brain. What happened that
dialog: night? Why won't they tell us?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't know. I don't know.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: They're monsters, Jake. We're both
dialog: seein' 'em. There's gotta be a
dialog: connection. Something.
text: JACOB leans back in the booth, his mind racing. The YOUNG MAN in the
text: next booth is watching them with rapt attention.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY
text: PAUL and JACOB are in the MEN'S ROOM. PAUL flushes the urinal.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I
dialog: keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come
dialog: up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a
dialog: guy can't even take a leak by
dialog: himself. I've seen 'em take people
dialog: right off the street. I used to go
dialog: home a different way every night. Now
dialog: I can't even go home.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You come home with me.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What about your girlfriend? You don't
dialog: think she'll mind?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Are you kidding? We've put up more of
dialog: her cousins. You wouldn't believe how
dialog: they breed down there.
text: PAUL smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. BAR - DAY
text: The TWO MEN leave the bar on a dingy side street. It is cold outside.
text: Christmas lights seem ludicrous dangling in the bar's front window.
text: PAUL looks at them and smiles.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Merry Christmas.
text: PAUL steps into the street and walks to the driver's side of his car.
text: He pulls out his keys and opens the door. JACOB looks down on the
text: sidewalk and notices a dime.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Goddamn, this is my lucky day.
text: He bends down to pick it up. PAUL inserts the key into the ignition and
text: steps on the gas. He turns the key.
text: THE CAR EXPLODES. Pieces of metal and flesh fly into the air. JACOB
text: sprawls out flat on the ground as the debris hurls above him. He covers
dialog: his head.
scene_heading: EXT. VIETNAM
text: CUT TO A HELICOPTER suffering an air bombardment. Flack is exploding
text: all around it and the shock waves are rocking the craft violently.
text: JACOB's eyes peer to the left.
text: INFANTRY GUNNERS are firing rockets into the JUNGLE below. A pair of
text: MEDICS are huddled over him. A sudden gush of arterial bleeding sends a
text: stream of blood splattering over the inside of the windshield. The
text: PILOT, unable to see, clears it away with his hands.
text: JACOB screams over the roar of the chopper. One of the MEDICS presses
text: his ear close to JACOB to hear.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Help me!
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: We're doing the best we can.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Get me out of here!
scene_heading: EXT. BAR - DAY
text: THE YOUNG MAN from the bar grabs JACOB under the arms and drags him
text: down the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Just hold on.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where am I? Who are you?
text: The YOUNG MAN yanks JACOB around the corner just as another explosion
text: consumes the car. The air is filled with flames and flying debris. The
text: YOUNG MAN pulls JACOB into the bar.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Just lie still. You're okay. You're
dialog: not hurt.
text: The CUSTOMERS are in a state of bedlam. Part of the wall has blown
text: apart and bricks and glass are everywhere. The cross from around PAUL's
text: neck is buried in the debris. Sirens are heard in the distance. A BLACK
text: CAR speeds off down the street. JACOB looks for the YOUNG MAN who had
text: helped him. He is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL PROCESSION - DAY
text: A FUNERAL PROCESSION heads down Ocean Parkway.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S CAR - DAY
text: JACOB and JEZZIE are driving in an old Chevy Nova. They are dressed up.
text: JACOB's face is bruised and he has a gauze pad over his ear. They drive
text: in silence. JACOB appears very sad. Slowly his right hand reaches
text: across the seat, seeking JEZZIE's. Their fingers embrace.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: The FUNERAL PROCESSION enters the CEMETERY. Cars park along the length
text: of the narrow road. MEN IN DARK SUITS emerge from their cars along with
text: WIVES and GIRLFRIENDS.
text: They are the SOLDIERS we have seen at the opening of the film, only
text: they are older now. A small group of FAMILY MEMBERS are helped to the
text: graveside.
text: JACOB joins the other VETERANS as pallbearers. They carry the casket in
text: semi-military formation to the grave.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: JACOB'S OLD ARMY BUDDIES are sitting together in Paul's living room,
text: talking. PAUL'S WIFE can be seen in the BEDROOM. Several WOMEN are
text: comforting her.
text: JEZZIE is talking to a small group of LADIES in the DINING ROOM and
text: nibbling off a tray of cold cuts. PAUL'S SISTER is with her and they
text: seem to be having a lively, almost intimate, conversation.
text: JACOB and his BUDDIES are drinking beer. They all have a tired,
text: defeated look about them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Did anyone see the police report? It
dialog: sounds like a detonation job to me.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: The paper said it was electrical; a
dialog: freak accident.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Bullshit. Someone's covering
dialog: somethin'. That was no accident.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Cars don't explode that way. Any
dialog: simpleton knows that.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But the paper ...
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: That was set. I'm tellin' you.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: By who? Why? Paul didn't have an
dialog: enemy in the world.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd
dialog: want to hurt him?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What did he talk about when you guys
dialog: went out? Did he say anything?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He was upset. He thought people were
text: following him.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You're kidding. Who?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He didn't know ... Demons.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (obviously struck by the
dialog: word)
dialog: What do you mean, demons?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He told me he was going to Hell.
dialog: The statement has a surprising impact on the group. There is immediate
text: silence and eyes averted from one another.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: What'd he say that for? What made him
dialog: say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What else did he say, Jake?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He was scared. He saw these creatures
text: coming out of the woodwork. They were
dialog: tryin' to get him, he said.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (his arm shaking)
dialog: How long had that been going on?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: A couple of weeks, I think.
text: He notices GEORGE's beer can rattling.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: He say what they looked like?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No. Not really ...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Excuse me a minute. I'll be right
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: In one end, out the other, huh
dialog: George?
text: GEORGE tries to smile as he hurries to the bathroom. His arm is nearly
text: out of control and beer is spilling on the carpet as he walks.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Still a spastic, huh? I hope you can
dialog: hold your dick better than you hold
dialog: that can.
text: No one laughs. There is an uncomfortable silence.
scene_heading: EXT. A BACK ALLEY - DAY
text: The SIX MEN are walking quietly through an unpaved alley. It is already
text: gray and getting darker.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I know what Paul was talking about. I
dialog: don't know how to say this ... but in
dialog: a way it's a relief knowing that
dialog: someone else saw them, too.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: You're seeing ... ?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: They're not human, I'll tell you
dialog: that. A car tried to run over me the
dialog: other day. It was aiming straight for
dialog: me. I saw their faces. They weren't
dialog: from Brooklyn.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: What are you tellin' me? They're from
dialog: the Bronx?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It was no joke, Rod.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Something weird is going on here.
dialog: What is it about us? Even in Nam it
dialog: was always weird. Are we all crazy or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, ever since that ...
text: He hesitates. They all understand.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: What's that have to do with anything?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It was bad grass. That's all it was.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Grass never did that to me.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You know, I've been to three shrinks
text: and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates
dialog: that night. Nothing.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: It's not worth goin' over again and
dialog: again. Whatever happened, happened.
text: It's over.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: ... I've seen them, too.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: So have I.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Look, there's something fucking
dialog: strange going on here. You know
dialog: Paul's not the only one who's died.
dialog: You remember Dr. Carlson over at
dialog: Bellevue? His car blew up, too.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Dr. Carlson's dead?
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: An explosion, just like Paul's.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You think they're connected?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: I think something's fucking connect-
dialog: ed. I mean, a car tried to run me
dialog: over the other day. Doug too, right?
dialog: We've got six guys here going fucking
dialog: crazy.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Not me, buddy.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us
dialog: are flipping out for some goddamn
dialog: reason. They're tryin' to kill us.
dialog: Fuck it man, we need to find out
dialog: what's going on.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Do you think it has something to do
dialog: with ... the offensive?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's got something to do with some-
dialog: thing. I think we've got to confront
dialog: the army. If they're hiding shit from
dialog: us, we better find out what it is.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Come on, Professor. The army's not
dialog: gonna give you any answers. You'll be
dialog: buttin' your head against a stone
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Maybe that's the only way to get
dialog: through. Besides, six heads'll be
dialog: better than one.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm
dialog: gettin' a headache just listenin' to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: We should get ourselves a lawyer.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: I say you should get a shrink.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Too late. I've tried. I think you're
dialog: right, Jake. I'm game.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: You guys are fucking paranoid. It was
dialog: bad grass. That's all it was. There's
dialog: no such thing as demons.
scene_heading: INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY
text: JACOB, FRANK, JERRY, GEORGE, DOUG, and ROD are sitting on plush chairs
text: in the LAW OFFICE of DONALD GEARY. GEARY, a red-faced man with three
text: chins, is sucking on an ice cube. He looks at each of the men, and then
text: spits the ice cube into an empty glass. It clinks.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you
dialog: have any idea how many people come to
dialog: me with the injustices of the world?
dialog: It'd break your heart.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The
dialog: army did something to us and we've
dialog: got to find out what.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: The army. The army. What is it with
dialog: you guys? We're not talking about a
dialog: trip to the library here. This is the
dialog: United States Government for God's
dialog: sake. This is red tape coming out of
dialog: your ass. You know what I mean?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Exactly. And we need someone to cut
dialog: through it. We hear you're the man.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason
dialog: here?
text: GEARY stands up and grabs a bag of Cheetos from a file drawer. He
text: chomps down a few and offers the bag to the others. There are no
text: takers. Thirsty, he downs the ice cube and cracks it between his teeth.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Okay. I'll look into it.
text: The MEN are surprised and excited.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wow! Do you think we have a chance?
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: What do you want, a fortune teller or
dialog: a lawyer? ... I'll need sworn
dialog: depositions from each of you and a
dialog: list of the other members of the
dialog: platoon, or their survivors.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, this is great.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: I'll tell you, if we find the
dialog: military is implicated in any way,
dialog: you could stand to recover quite a
dialog: lot of money. Not that I can predict
dialog: anything, but some class action suits
dialog: of this kind have been awarded fairly
dialog: generous judgements. That wouldn't be
dialog: so bad, would it Mr. Singer?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Doctor.
text: (GEARY looks at him
dialog: oddly)
dialog: Ph.D.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Then why aren't you teaching? Why
dialog: aren't you in a university?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm too messed up to teach.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Ah! Well then, they're going to have
dialog: to pay for that, aren't they?
text: The MEN all nod in agreement.
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
text: JACOB and the others exit the OFFICE BUILDING. They are jubilant,
text: clasping hands and smacking each other on the back. We watch as they
text: break up. JACOB heads for the subway. FRANK and another group hop a
text: cab. As the cab pulls away we notice that a black car pulls out behind
text: it. It follows them out of sight.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: JACOB and JEZZIE are making wild and unadulterated love on the kitchen
text: floor. The wastebasket flips over. JACOB's hand splashes into the dog's
text: bowl. Nothing impedes their passion. JEZZIE laughs, hollers, and
text: swoons. Hands grab hold of table legs. Chairs topple. Feet bang wildly
text: against the stove. It is all mayhem and ecstacy. And then it ends.
text: JACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply basks in
text: JEZZIE's glow. She looks especially lovely and radiant. They lie
text: exhausted and exhilarated on the linoleum floor.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: So tell me ... am I still an angel?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (smiling broadly)
dialog: With wings. You transport me, you
dialog: know that? You carry me away.
text: JEZZIE kisses him softly around his face and gently probes his ear with
text: her pinky. JACOB loves it.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: We're all angels, you know ...
text: (she bites his earlobe.
dialog: He winces)
dialog: ... and devils. It's just what you
dialog: choose to see.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I love you, Jez.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Underneath all the bullshit, just
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Remember that.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You know what? I feel ... exorcised
text: ... like the demons are gone.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: How come? The army?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: In a way. At least now I have some
dialog: idea of what was happening. If we can
dialog: only get them to admit ... to explain
dialog: what they did ... I don't know. Maybe
dialog: it'd clear things up in my head. I'll
dialog: tell you something, Jez, honestly
dialog: ... I thought they were real.
text: Silence. Suddenly JEZZIE roars like a monster and scares JACOB half to
text: death. They laugh and tumble back to the floor.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APT. - EVENING
text: JACOB emerges from the bathroom shower and pulls on a robe. JEZZIE is
text: moving rapidly around the KITCHEN.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a
dialog: Manhandler. It'll be ready at a
dialog: quarter of. I threw a little salad
dialog: together. It's in the fridge. I also
dialog: bought some apple juice, Red Cheek.
dialog: Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake,
dialog: your lawyer called.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: He did? When?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (grabbing her coat)
dialog: While you were in the shower.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why didn't you call me?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: He didn't give me a chance.
dialog: (she pauses nervously)
dialog: Look, honey, don't get upset, but
dialog: he's not taking your case.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: What? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: He said you didn't have one.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's he talking about?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I don't know. That's all he said. He
dialog: wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He
dialog: said your buddies backed down. They
dialog: chickened out, he said.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't believe this.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd
dialog: stay and talk but I'm so late. Look,
dialog: don't be upset. We'll talk when I get
dialog: home. See you around midnight.
text: (she kisses him on the
dialog: cheek)
dialog: Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or
dialog: something.
scene_heading: JACOB'S APT./FRANK'S APT. - INTERCUT
text: The door slams securely. The locks set. JACOB begins instantly rifling
text: through a desk drawer. He comes up with a frayed address book and looks
text: up a number. He dials.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
text: We see FRANK standing at a window fingering the Venetian blinds. He
text: does not reply. The scene intercuts between the two men.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Listen, I just got a strange call
dialog: from Geary. He said the guys backed
dialog: down. What's he talking about?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (fingering the Venetian
dialog: blinds)
dialog: That's right. We did.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What does that mean, Frank? I don't
dialog: get it. Why?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's hard to explain.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Well, try, huh.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't know if I can. It's just that
dialog: war is war. Things happen.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Things happen? What the fuck are you
dialog: talking about? They did something to
dialog: us, Frank. We have to expose this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's nothing to expose.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to
dialog: you?
dialog: (silence)
dialog: What's going on? How can you just
dialog: turn away?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: What about the others?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They're not interested, Jake.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Shit! You know it's not half the case
dialog: if I go it alone. We're all suffering
text: the same symptoms, Frank. The army is
dialog: to blame. They've done something to
dialog: us. How can you not want to know?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (pausing)
dialog: Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe there's a larger truth.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe the demons are real.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What the hell? What kind of mumbo
dialog: jumbo ... ?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm hanging up.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hey, wait!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't bother to call again, okay?
text: FRANK hangs up. JACOB stands holding the phone for a long time, until
text: the high pitched whine from the receiver reminds him it's off the hook.
text: The sound frightens him and he slams the receiver down. QUickly JACOB
text: tears through his address book looking for other phone numbers. They
dialog: aren't there.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Shit!
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APT.
text: JACOB hurries into the BEDROOM and pulls an old shoe box from the
text: closet. The box is filled with yellowing army papers, dog tags, and
text: photos of old comrades. Beneath his discharge papers he finds a sheet
text: scribbled with the names and addresses of platoon buddies. JACOB grabs
text: it. Then his eyes fall on the frayed remains of an old letter. He picks
text: it up and unfolds it with great care. The letter is written in a
text: child's handwriting. "DEAR DADDY, I LOVE YOU. PLEASE COME HOME. JED GOT
scene_heading: A FROG. ELI LOST MY KEY. MOM WANTS YOU TO SEND HER MONEY. LOVE, GABE."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - DAY
text: GABE, on a BICYCLE, is rushing down the sidewalk. JACOB is running
text: alongside him, holding onto the seat. Plastic streamers trail from the
text: handlebars. GABE is a bit wobbly, but determined. After a couple of
text: false starts, JACOB lets go and GABE is riding by himself. For an
text: instant, GABE looks back at his father with a huge grin on his face.
text: JACOB is grinning, too. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON GABE as he pulls away from
text: us and heads into the distance.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT
text: JACOB swallows hard as he stands there, holding the letter. Suddenly
text: his eyes lift off the page and glance at a full length mirror mounted
text: on the bedroom door. Something in the mirror, like the image of a
text: child, seems to move. He looks over. There is nothing there. Curious,
text: JACOB walks toward the mirror. As his image appears, he gasps and stops
text: moving. To his horror and ours, it is his own back that is reflected in
text: the mirror. The impossibility of the moment startles him. He lifts his
text: hand. The reflection moves with him. Frightened but defiant, JACOB
text: moves toward the mirror. The image in the mirror spins around. It is
text: the FRIGHTENING VIBRATING FACE he saw at the party with JEZZIE. An
text: unearthly scream comes from both their mouths.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: NO!!!
scene_heading: INT. BROOKLYN COURT HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A huge wooden door slams open. JACOB charges through it.
text: He is chasing his lawyer, DONALD GEARY, through a crowded court house
text: corridor. GEARY, sweaty and unshaven, is cradling a Coke in one hand, a
text: sandwich and a briefcase in the other. His stomach bounces wildly as he
dialog: walks.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Geary! Mr. Geary! Listen, goddamn it!
dialog: You can't just walk away from this.
text: GEARY keeps walking. JACOB catches up to him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Who's been talking to you? The army?
dialog: Have they been talking to you, huh?
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: Nobody's been talking to nobody. You
dialog: don't have a case, you hear me? It's
dialog: pure and simple. Now leave me alone.
dialog: Okay?
text: JACOB grabs the back of GEARY's jacket and pulls him up short.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Take your hands off me!
text: JACOB lets go. He stares into GEARY's eyes.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Listen, will you listen? They're
dialog: trying to get me. They're comin' out
dialog: of the walls. The army's done
dialog: something to me. I need you.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: You need ... a doctor.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: A doctor? And what's he gonna do,
dialog: tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked
dialog: with my head. I've got to prove it.
dialog: You've got to do something.
text: GEARY gives JACOB a pitiful look.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: There's nothing I can do.
text: He turns and walks away. JACOB stands there a moment, and then rushes
text: after him. GEARY is biting into his sandwich.
text: Mayonnaise spills onto his hand. He licks it with his tongue. JACOB
text: catches up to him.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: You mind? I'm eating, huh?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Something's going on here. You're not
dialog: telling me something. What the hell's
dialog: gotten into you?
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: I'll tell you what's gotten into me.
dialog: I don't know you from Adam, right?
dialog: You come to my office with this
dialog: bizarro story and demand I look into
dialog: it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and
dialog: I did. Now I don't know what kind of
dialog: fool you take me for, but you have
dialog: used and abused me, and I don't like
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Used you?
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: I talked to the Army's Bureau of
dialog: Records. You've never even been to
dialog: Viet Nam.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What the hell is that supposed to
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: It means that you and your buddies
dialog: are whacko, that you were discharged
dialog: on psychological grounds after some
dialog: war games in Thailand.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: War games? Thailand? That's not true!
dialog: How can you believe that? Can't you
dialog: see what they're doing? It's all a
dialog: lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's
dialog: sake. You've got to believe me.
speaker_heading: GEARY
dialog: I don't have to do any such thing.
dialog: I'm eating my lunch, okay?
text: GEARY takes a swig of his COKE and begins walking away. JACOB, enraged,
text: charges after him. With a wild swipe he sends the COKE CAN shooting out
text: of GEARY's hand. It reverberates down the corridor. GEARY is stunned.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You slimy bastard! You goddamn piece
dialog: of shit!
text: With a powerful thrust, JACOB rips the sandwich from GEARY's other
text: hand. Tossing it on the floor, he grinds his heel in it. Tomato and
text: mayonnaise squirt onto GEARY's shoe. JACOB turns away.
text: CUT TO JACOB walking down the COURT HOUSE CORRIDOR to the elevators.
text: There is a look of satisfaction on his face.
text: CUT BACK TO GEARY. He picks up a telephone and dials. Someone comes on
text: the line. GEARY speaks quietly.
speaker_heading: GEARY
text: He's on his way.
text: CUT TO JACOB stepping onto the elevator. The doors close. The Muzak is
text: playing "Sonny Boy" with Al Jolson singing. JACOB is surprised to hear
text: it. He presses the down button for the main floor.
text: The elevator stops at the LOBBY. The doors open swiftly. SEVERAL
text: SOLDIERS are standing there. They approach JACOB.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 1
dialog: Let's go, Singer.
text: JACOB is shocked to see them. He tries to get away but two of the
text: SOLDIERS yank him toward the LOBBY doors.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 2
dialog: You're coming with us.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
text: JACOB is hustled to a waiting car and shoved inside, in between two
text: officious looking MEN. The doors lock from the DRIVER's command.
speaker_heading: ARMY OFFICIAL #1
dialog: Mr. Singer. What an appropriate name
dialog: for a man who can't keep his mouth
dialog: shut.
text: The car drives off.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Who are you? What do you want?
speaker_heading: ARMY OFFICIAL #2
dialog: We've been watching you for a long
dialog: time. You and your friends. You've
dialog: been exhibiting some very odd
dialog: behavior. Frightening people with
dialog: foolish talk about demons - and
dialog: experiments.
text: JACOB tries to speak but the other MAN grabs his mouth.
speaker_heading: ARMY OFFICIAL #1
dialog: You're in over your head, Mr. Singer.
dialog: Men drown that way. The army was
dialog: another part of your life. Forget it.
text: It is dead and buried. Let it lie.
speaker_heading: ARMY OFFICIAL #2
dialog: I hope we have made our point, Mr.
dialog: Singer.
text: JACOB stares at the men for a moment and then goes totally berserk.
text: Letting out a howl, he begins pounding and thrashing like a madman. He
text: is totally out of control.
text: With a wild leap, he grabs for the door handle. The door flies open. It
text: flaps back and forth, slamming into parked cars. JACOB tries to jump
text: out, but the men yank him back in. One of them pulls out a gun. JACOB
text: sees it and goes crazy. His feet kick in all directions, slamming the
text: DRIVER's nose into the steering wheel and shattering the side window.
text: The car careens around a corner sending the gun flying to the floor.
text: The men dive for it. It lodges beneath the seat. In the mayhem, JACOB
text: throws himself out of the flapping door and sprawls onto the pavement.
text: People look down at him as the car speeds away.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN - LATE AFTERNOON
text: JACOB grabs his back. He is in excruciating pain. He tries to get up,
text: but can't move. He reaches out to people passing by, but they ignore
text: him and hurry past.
text: A SALVATION ARMY SANTA has been watching the entire scene. After a
text: moment's consideration he leaves his post and ambles over to JACOB. He
text: leans down and steals his wallet.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Merry Christmas.
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING
text: CUT TO THE SOUND OF A SIREN as an AMBULANCE races through the streets.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - EVENING
text: AN AMBULANCE CREW rushes JACOB to a HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM.
speaker_heading: BEARER
text: He's been screaming like a madman.
dialog: You better get something in him.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
speaker_heading: (approaching JACOB)
dialog: Hi. I'm Doctor Stewart. Can you tell
dialog: me what happened?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: My back. I can't move. I need my
dialog: chiropractor.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: Your back? Did you fall?
speaker_heading: BEARER
dialog: They said he slipped on the ice. May
text: have hit his head.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Does he have any identification?
speaker_heading: BEARER
dialog: No waller. Nothing.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: They stole it.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: Who did?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my
text: son's picture in it. Gabe's picture.
dialog: It's the only one I had.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: We better get an orthopedic man in
dialog: here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I'll page him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Call my chiropractor.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: We're doing everything we can.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: I'm going to have to move you a bit,
dialog: just to check for injuries. This may
dialog: hurt a little.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No. Don't move me.
text: The RESIDENT ignores him. JACOB screams.
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: I don't have to ask if you can feel
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Goddamn it. I want Louis.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Who's Louis?
speaker_heading: RESIDENT
dialog: He's out of it. I'm taking him down
text: to X-ray.
text: An ORDERLY pushes the gurney through a pair of sliding doors. JACOB
text: tries to get up but the pain keeps him immobilized.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT
text: JACOB begins a journey down what appears to be an endless series of
text: corridors. The wheels of the gurney turn with a hypnotic regularity.
text: The smooth tile floor gives way to roguh cement. The ORDERLY's feet
text: plod through pools of blood that coagulate in cracks and crevices along
text: the way. The surface grows rougher, the wheels more insistent. Body
text: parts and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves
dialog: faster.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where are you taking me? Where am I?
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: You know where you are.
text: JACOB, panicked, tries again to get up but to no effect. He glances to
text: the side and sees mournful CREATURES being led into dark rooms. No one
text: fights or struggles. We hear muffled screams from behind closed doors.
text: Occasionally he glances inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in
text: strange contraptions, people in rusty iron lungs, and hanging from
text: metal cages. Dark eyes peer out in horror. In one room a baseboard
text: heater bursts into flame. No one seems concerned. A door opens. A
text: bicycle with plastic streamers on the handlebars lies crushed and
text: mangled. One of its wheels is still spinning. JACOB cries out but it is
text: not his voice we hear. Rather it is a familiar unearthly roar. His
text: whole body stiffens. As he rounds the corner he sees a figure, its head
text: vibrating in endless terror. it is the same image he has seen before.
text: JACOB screams.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - NIGHT
text: JACOB is wheeled into a tiny ROOM. A numer of "DOCTORS" are waiting. As
text: they draw closer JACOB notices that something about them is not right.
text: They bear a subtle resemblance to Bosch-like DEMONS, creatures of
text: another world. JACOB tries to sit up but winces in pain. He cannot
text: move. He tries to scream but no sound comes out.
text: Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They are lowered and attached
text: with speed and efficiency to JACOB's arms and legs. He screams.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh God!
text: The "DOCTORS" laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing. JACOB
text: is left in semi-darkness. Suddenly a new group of "DOCTORS" emerges
text: from the shadows. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They
text: surround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. JACOB
text: is panting and sweating in fear. One of the "DOCTORS" leans over JACOB.
text: He gasps with horror. It is JEZZIE.
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: JEZZIE!
text: She pays no attention to him. He stares at her, THE CAMERA TILTING DOWN
text: HER BODY. As it gets to her foot we see it is a decaying mass, swarming
text: with maggots. The "DOCTORS" laugh. They take great pleasure in his
text: suffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each utterance
text: contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate,
text: taunting and mocking at the same time. The confusion of meanings is a
dialog: torment of its own.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Get me out of here.
speaker_heading: "DOCTOR"
dialog: Where do you want to go?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Take me home.
speaker_heading: "DOCTOR"
dialog: Home?
dialog: (they all laugh)
dialog: This is your home. You're dead.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm
dialog: not dead.
speaker_heading: "DOCTOR"
dialog: What are you then?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm alive.
speaker_heading: "DOCTOR"
dialog: Then what are you doing here?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't know. I don't know.
dialog: (he struggles like an
dialog: animal)
dialog: This isn't happening.
speaker_heading: "DOCTOR"
dialog: What isn't happening?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Let me out of here!
speaker_heading: "DOCTOR"
dialog: There is no out of here. You've been
dialog: killed. Don't you remember?
text: A "DOCTOR" approaches JACOB. As he turns, we notice with horror that he
text: has no eyes or eye sockets. He extracts a long needle from his belt and
text: positions it over JACOB's head. Like a divining rod it locates a
text: particular point near the crown of his head. With a powerful thrust the
text: "DOCTOR" shoves the needle into JACOB's skull and pushes it slowly into
text: his brain. JACOB howls.
scene_heading: EXT. VIETNAM - NIGHT
text: CUT RAPIDLY TO VIETNAM and a replay of flashes of the opening sequence
text: of the film. SOLDIERS with bayonets are charging over rice paddies in
text: the dark of the night. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS charges at JACOB with a long
text: bayonet blade and jams it into his intestines. JACOB cries out.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - NIGHT
text: CUT BACK TO THE "DOCTORS".
speaker_heading: "DOCTOR"
dialog: Remember?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No! That was years ago! I've lived
dialog: years since then.
speaker_heading: "DOCTOR"
dialog: It's all been a dream.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No! The army did this to me! They've
dialog: done something to my brain.
dialog: (he raves like a madman)
dialog: Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm
dialog: not dead! I want my family!
text: The "DOCTORS" laugh and back away, disappearing into the darkness.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Suddenly a fluorescent light flashes overhead. NORMAL HOSPITAL WALLS
text: materialize instantaneously around him. A NURSE enters the room
text: followed by SARAH, ELI, and JED. They approach JACOB who is lying in
text: traction, suspended over a hospital bed.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: He's still pretty doped up. I don't
dialog: think he'll be able to talk yet and I
dialog: doubt that he'll recognize you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I just want to see him.
speaker_heading: JED
dialog: (eating a Snickers bar)
dialog: Dad. Hi. It's us. We just found out.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: You look terrible. Does that hurt?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I'll be outside if you need me.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Jake. It's me. We heard what
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (his voice hoarse,
dialog: nearly whispering)
dialog: I'm not dead. I am not dead.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. Of course you're not. You've just
dialog: hurt your back. That's all. You're
dialog: going to be fine. It'll just take
dialog: some time.
speaker_heading: JED
dialog: A month, they said.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (trying to joke)
dialog: You just hang in there, Dad.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (smacking him)
dialog: That's not funny.
dialog: (she reaches over and
dialog: rubs JACOB's brow)
dialog: What a mess, huh? God I wish there
dialog: was something I could do. I love you,
dialog: Jacob. For whatever that's worth. I
dialog: do.
text: There is a sudden sound of "DOCTORS" laughing. JACOB jerks his head
text: painfully, but does not see them.
speaker_heading: "DOCTOR" (O.S.)
dialog: Dream on!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (yelling at the unseen
dialog: voice)
dialog: No! Oh God.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Jacob, what can I do?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Save me!
text: JACOB's plea confuses SARAH. She responds with a kiss.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
text: DAYLIGHT streams through the window in JACOB's ROOM. He is still in
text: traction and looks very uncomfortable. A new NURSE enters holding a
text: plastic container with a straw poking out.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Well, don't we look better this
dialog: morning? That was a hard night,
dialog: wasn't it?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where am I?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Lennox Hospital.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm awake?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You look awake to me. Here.
text: (she holds the straw to
dialog: his lips)
dialog: Drink some of this.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (staring at her
dialog: intently)
dialog: Where's Sarah? Where did she go?
dialog: (the NURSE gives him a
dialog: strange look)
dialog: She was here ...
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That's a lie. My family was here.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Last night! They were as real as you
dialog: are!
text: The NURSE smiles and nods in appeasement.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: This is not a dream! This is my life.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Of course it is. What else could it
dialog: be?
text: She giggles nervously. There is a funny glint in her eyes. JACOB looks
text: away. He doesn't want to see it.
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - EVENING
text: There is a loud commotion in the HALL. We see LOUIS SCHWARTZ, JACOB's
text: chiropractor, screaming JACOB's name.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Jacob! Jacob Singer!
text: JACOB yells.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Louis! I'm here! In here!
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S ROOM - DAY
text: LOUIS storms through JACOB's door followed by several NURSES and
speaker_heading: ORDERLIES.
speaker_heading: JACOB
speaker_heading: LOUIS!
speaker_heading: NURSE 1
dialog: You can't go in there!
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: You're going to have to leave.
text: LOUIS stares furiously at JACOB stretched out on the traction
text: apparatus. He begins to yell.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Good God, Jake. What have they done?
dialog: (he examines JACOB and
dialog: screams at the NURSES)
dialog: What is this, the Middle Ages? And
dialog: they call this modern medicine. This
dialog: is barbaric! Barbaric!
dialog: (turning to JACOB)
dialog: It's okay, Jake. It's not serious.
dialog: I'll get you out of here.
dialog: (yelling at the ORDERLY)
dialog: What is this, the Inquisition? Why
dialog: don't you just burn him at the stake
dialog: and put him out of his misery?
text: LOUIS charges over to the traction equipment and begins working the
text: pulleys that suspend JACOB over the bed. The NURSES and ORDERLIES
text: become instantly hysterical and start screaming.
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: What the hell do you think ... ?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Don't you come near me.
speaker_heading: NURSE 2
dialog: You can't do that!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What is this, a prison? Stay back.
speaker_heading: NURSE 1
dialog: You can't. Call the police.
text: One of the ORDERLIES lunges at LOUIS who swings back at him with one of
text: the pulley chains. It just misses.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
speaker_heading: (to the ORDERLIES)
dialog: You take one step and I'll wrap this
dialog: around your neck.
text: LOUIS lowers JACOB into a wheelchair while holding the others at bay.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hold on, Jake, we're getting out of
dialog: here.
text: NURSES and ORDERLIES part as he pushes him quickly from the room.
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: INT. CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - EVENING
text: LOUIS helps JACOB over to an adjusting table in a room that, compared
text: with the hospital, is comfortable and serene. He pushes a lever and the
text: table rises to a vertical position. JACOB leans against it and rides it
text: down to a horizontal position. Every moment is agony for him.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Half an hour from now and you'll be
dialog: walking out of here all by yourself.
dialog: Mark my words.
speaker_heading: (JACOB barely hears
dialog: them)
dialog: Well, you've done it to yourself this
dialog: time, haven't you?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (nearly whispering)
dialog: Am I dead, Louis?
speaker_heading: (LOUIS leans over to
dialog: hear)
dialog: Am I dead?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: From a slipped disc? That'd be a
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I was in Hell. I've been there. It's
dialog: horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Well, I'll see what I can do about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I've seen it. It's all pain.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
speaker_heading: (working on JACOB's
dialog: spine like a master
dialog: mechanic)
dialog: You ever read Meister Eckart?
text: (JACOB shakes his head
dialog: "no")
dialog: How did you ever get your Doctorate
dialog: without reading Eckart?
speaker_heading: (LOUIS takes hold of
text: JACOB's legs and yanks
dialog: them swiftly)
dialog: Good. Okay, let's turn over gently.
dialog: Right side.
text: JACOB turns to his left. LOUIS shakes his head in dismay.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: The other "right," okay?
dialog: (he helps JACOB turn
dialog: over)
dialog: You're a regular basket case, you
dialog: know that?
text: (he moves JACOB's arm
dialog: over his head)
dialog: Eckart saw Hell, too.
text: LOUIS positions JACOB's other arm, bends his legs, and then pushes down
text: on his thigh. His spine moves with a cracking sound. JACOB groans.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know what he said? The only thing
dialog: that burns in Hell is the part of you
dialog: that won't let go of your life; your
dialog: memories, your attachments. They burn
dialog: 'em all away. But they're not punish-
dialog: ing you, he said. They're freeing
dialog: your soul. Okay, other side.
text: He helps JACOB and repositions him. Again he pushes and the spine
dialog: cracks.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Wonderful. So the way he sees it, if
dialog: you're frightened of dying and hold-
dialog: ing on, you'll see devils tearing
dialog: your life away. But if you've made
dialog: your peace then the devils are really
dialog: angels freeing you from the earth.
dialog: It's just a matter of how you look at
dialog: it, that's all. So don't worry, okay?
dialog: Relax. Wiggle your toes.
text: JACOB's toes dance as LOUIS gives him a quick, unexpected jab to the
text: lower vertebrae in his back.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Perfect. We got it.
text: (LOUIS pushes a lever
text: and the table rises back
dialog: up)
dialog: Okay. Let's just give it a little
dialog: try. See if you can stand.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What? By myself?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just
dialog: give it a try.
text: JACOB steps cautiously away from the table. He moves hesitantly, with
text: deliberate restraint. LOUIS encourages him like a faith healer coaxing
text: the lame. His first steps have an aura of the miraculous about them.
text: JACOB walks slowly, without help. LOUIS smiles impishly. He looks like
text: a giant cherub.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hallelujah.
text: LOUIS puts his arm around him. Then JACOB tries again, gradually
text: rediscovering his balance and strength. With each step his confidence
text: returns. LOUIS is pleased. Then, suddenly, without warning, JACOB turns
text: and heads toward the door.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: There's something I've gotta take
dialog: care of, Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What are you talking about? You can
dialog: barely stand.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm walking, aren't I?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Jake, you need to rest.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
text: He walks slowly out the door. LOUIS starts to go after him. JACOB turns
text: around and shakes his head "no." The look on his face is firm and
text: defiant. LOUIS stands back and lets him go.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I love you, Louis.
scene_heading: EXT. U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: CUT TO A SDIREN BLARING and a fire engine racing through the streets of
text: lower MANHATTAN. A CROWD is forming. Banks of lights and television
text: cameras amass in the cold night air. Police cars and mobile units rush
text: to the scene.
text: CUT TO JACOB. In one hand he is holding a brightly lit torch. In the
text: other he is holding a container of gasoline and pouring it on the steps
text: of the U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS. The volatile liquid splashes
text: against his pants and shoes and runs down the pavement. A five gallon
text: container lies emptying nearby. Gasoline belches from it insistently
text: and pours onto the street. Bystanders back away as the gasoline snakes
text: toward them.
text: Television cameras and microphones are pointing in JACOB's direction,
text: but at a safe distance. He is yelling at them, his teeth chattering
dialog: from the cold.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Listen to me. There were four
dialog: companies in our batallion. Five
dialog: hundred men. Seven of us were left
dialog: when it was over. Seven! Four
dialog: companies engaged in an enemy
dialog: offensive that not one of us who
dialog: survived can remember fighting.
speaker_heading: BYSTANDERS
dialog: Use the torch!
speaker_heading: ONLOOKER
dialog: Shut up! Let him talk!
text: POLICE AMBULANCES are arriving at the scene. FIREMEN ready hoses at
text: nearby hydrants. T.V. CAMERAS are rolling.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: You don't forget a battle where 500
dialog: men were killed. They did something
dialog: to us. I want to know the truth, the
dialog: goddamn truth. We have a right to
dialog: know.
text: (he yells toward the
dialog: cameras)
dialog: Are you getting all this? I want this
dialog: on national T.V. I want the whole
dialog: country, the whole world to know.
text: He holds up the torch. A loudspeaker blares through the crowd.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Throw that torch away, young man.
dialog: Give yourself up. You're under
dialog: arrest.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: For what? For seeking the truth?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Please come quietly.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You come near me and I'll blow us all
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: We're not going to hurt you.
speaker_heading: ONLOOKER
dialog: Give him a chance to talk!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: The army will deny it. They've
dialog: falsified my records. They've lied to
dialog: my lawyer, threatened my buddies. But
dialog: they can't threaten me.
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER
dialog: You tell 'em!
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER
dialog: Use the torch!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Okay, let's clear the area. Everyone
dialog: out.
text: Suddenly a lighted match flies in JACOB's direction. JACOB is enraged.
text: He brandishes the torch at the crowd.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What the fuck do you think you're
dialog: doing?
text: Another match hurls toward him and dies in mid-air. PEOPLE on the
text: fringe of the crowd begin to run. JACOB does not move.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Clear the area. This is an order!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What is wrong with you?
text: We hear laughter from PEOPLE in the crowd. As JACOB looks out into some
text: of their eyes he sees demons looking back. One of them throws another
text: match. Crazed, JACOB runs toward them. PEOPLE jump back.
text: Suddenly JACOB freezes. Standing on the sidelines, he sees one of the
text: ARMY OFFICIALS who trapped him in the car. He is reaching for a gun.
text: JACOB, stunned, yells at the top of hhis lungs.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: NO!
text: With a defiant roar, he hurls the torch straight up into the air. We
text: see it from high above the crowd spinning higher and higher. All eyes
text: stare upward watching it in a kind of wonder. Then, reaching its apex,
text: just below the camera, it begins its descent. The eyes of the crowd
text: turn to fear. SOMEONE yells.
speaker_heading: ONLOOKER
dialog: He'll burn us all!
text: Screams fill the air as PEOPLE scramble to escape the potential
text: conflagration. Only JACOB remains motionless, standing silently, almost
text: heroically, in the middle of it all.
text: Suddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline ignites with
text: a blinding flare that sends flames shooting in all directions. PEOPLE
text: panic. T.V. REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN run for their lives. The ARMY
text: OFFICIALS run, too. The flames travel toward the Army Headquarters and
text: rush along the curb. Water hoses are trying to douse them as they
text: spread. JACOB, surprisingly untouched by the fire, walks slowly through
text: the frightened crowds, as if in a daze. Viewed through the flames the
text: scene momentarily resembles a vision of Hell.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT
text: JACOB, stark naked and covered with goose bumps, runs his hands under a
text: shower spray. The water is freezing and taking forever to warm up.
text: Anxious, he dashes past his gasoline drenched clothes, grabs a suitcase
text: from the BEDROOM closet, and stuffs it with clothes. Then he hurries
text: back to the shower, tests it, and jumps in.
text: Lather covers JACOB's hair and hangs over his tightly closed eyes. His
text: entire body is covered in suds. He is washing as quickly as he can.
text: Suddenly he hears a noise as someone enters the BATHROOM. He tenses.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Who's there? Who is it?
text: JACOB struggles to rinse the soap from his eyes. They are burning.
text: There is a shadow behind the curtain.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Goddamn it! Who's there?
text: JACOB rubs his eyes, fighting to see. Suddenly the shower curtain is
text: thrown back. JACOB backs against the wall. A hand reaches in and pulls
text: his nipple, pinching hard.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: It's just me.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jezzie?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Who else were you expecting?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Let go!
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Where were you, Jake? Where've you
dialog: been? Why haven't you called?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Stay away from me, Jez.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I want to know. You tell me!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You wanna know? Turn on the T.V.
dialog: Watch the fucking news!
text: He pushes her away and jumps out of the shower.
text: CUT TO JACOB dressing and piling the last of his clothes into his
text: suitcase. JEZZIE, in a robe, is watching him.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Why are you doing this to me? You
dialog: can't just go away like that.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I can do anything I want.
text: She stares at him with confusion. THE PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Don't!
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: It might be for me.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (picking up the
dialog: receiver)
dialog: Hello ... No. He's not here. I
dialog: haven't seen him all night ... I
dialog: don't know when ... What? Tell him
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: (JACOB looks up)
dialog: Vietnam? ... What experiments?
text: JACOB lunges for the phone.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hello. This is Jacob Singer.
dialog: (he listens with growing
dialog: fascination)
dialog: God almighty! ... Yes. Yes. Right.
dialog: Where would you like to meet?
dialog: (he listens)
dialog: How will I know you.
speaker_heading: (JACOB seems
dialog: uncomfortable)
dialog: Okay. I'll be there.
text: He hangs up the phone and stands silently for a moment.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare
dialog: unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me
dialog: and that I'll know him when I see him.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I have no idea.
dialog: (he thinks)
dialog: I was right. There were experiments.
dialog: I knew it. I knew it. My God.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: How do you know he's telling the
dialog: truth?
text: JACOB stares at JEZZIE for several moments but does not respond. The
text: 11:00 NEWS is coming on. JACOB's image can be seen on the screen. We
text: hear the NEWSCASTER speaking.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER
text: Leading the news tonight, a bizarre
dialog: demonstration on the steps of the
dialog: U.S. Army Recruiting Headquarters, in
dialog: downtown Manhattan. Jacob Singer, an
dialog: alleged Vietnam vet ...
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Alleged? Alleged?
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER
dialog: ... challenged the United States Army
dialog: to admit conducting secret experi-
dialog: ments involving hundreds of American
dialog: soldiers during the Vietnam war.
text: JEZZIE stares at the T.V., dumbfounded. JACOB takes his suitcase and
text: hurries to the front door. He opens it a crack and peers into the
text: hallway. JEZZIE runs after him.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (almost threatening)
dialog: Don't leave me, Jake.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: JACOB gazes at JEZZIE for a moment and then hurries down the HALL. He
text: stops at the stairwell and looks back. JEZZIE is still standing there.
text: She is very angry. JACOB just stares at her for a moment and then
text: disappears down the stairwell.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: JACOB is standing near the WESTSIDE HIGHWAY. GROUPS OF MEN in black
text: leather jackets are crusing the area and look at JACOB with curiosity.
text: One MAN in particular cruises by several times and then approaches him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Jacob? Hi. I'm Michael Newman.
dialog: Friends call me Mike.
text: JACOB is startled when he sees him. He is the same YOUNG MAN who has
text: appeared throughout the film, assisting JACOB in moments of crisis.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know
dialog: me. I've been tracking you for a long
dialog: time. I just wish I'd spoken to you
dialog: before tonight.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't get it. Who are you? Why have
dialog: you been following me?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Observation, mainly. Clinical study.
dialog: You were one of the survivors.
text: A POLICE CAR passes them on the street. MICHAEL grabs JACOB's shoulder
text: and turns him away nervously.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Come on, we're not safe around here.
scene_heading: HUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT
text: JACOB and MICHAEL are sitting on a deserted WEST SIDE PIER that juts
text: into the Hudson River. JACOB is wide-eyed as he listens to MICHAEL's
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So first I'm arrested, right? Best
dialog: LSD I ever made, right down the
dialog: drain. I figure this is it, twenty
dialog: years in the joint, if I'm lucky.
dialog: That was '68.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Long time ago.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (nodding his head)
dialog: Next thing I know I'm on Rikers
dialog: Island. Ever been there?
dialog: (JACOB shakes his head)
dialog: Suddenly they take me from my cell to
dialog: the visitors room with those bank
dialog: teller windows, you know. Four army
text: colonels, medals up their asses, are
text: standing on the other side. They tell
dialog: me if I'll come to Vietnam for two
dialog: years, no action, mind you, just work
dialog: in a lab, they'll drop all the
dialog: charges and wipe the record clean.
dialog: Well, I'd only been in jail for
dialog: thirteen hours and I already knew
dialog: that Nam couldn't be any worse.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Shows how much you knew.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No shit. They had me by the balls.
dialog: Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ...
text: in a secret lab synthesizing mind-
dialog: altering drugs. Not the street stuff
dialog: mind you. They had us isolating
dialog: special properties. The dark side,
dialog: you know? They wanted a drug that
dialog: increased aggressive tendencies.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Right. They were worried. They
dialog: figured you guys were too soft. They
dialog: wanted something to stir you up, tap
dialog: into your anger, you know? And we did
dialog: it. The most powerful thing I ever
dialog: saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my
dialog: share, never compared to the fury of
dialog: the Ladder.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: The Ladder?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That's what they called it. A fast
text: trip right down the ladder.
dialog: (he makes a downward
dialog: dive with his hand)
dialog: Right to the primal fear, the base
dialog: anger. I'm tellin' you, it was
dialog: powerful stuff. But I don't need to
dialog: tell you. You know.
text: JACOB can barely catch his breath, the information he is receiving is
dialog: so powerful to his mind.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We did experiments on jungle monkeys.
text: They bashed each other's heads in,
text: gouged out their eyes, chewed off
dialog: their tails. The brass loved it. Then
dialog: they made us try it on Charlie.
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: They took these POW's, just kids
dialog: really, and put 'em in a courtyard.
dialog: We fed 'em huge doses of the stuff.
text: (he stops for a moment;
text: a tear rolls down his
dialog: cheek)
dialog: They were worse than the monkeys. I
dialog: never knew men could do such things.
dialog: The whole thing still blows me away.
text: MICHAEL stands up and begins walking in circles around the PIER. JACOB,
text: astounded, gets up and walks beside him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Anyway, this big offensive was coming
dialog: up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine,
dialog: Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was
dialog: scared 'cause they knew we couldn't
dialog: win. Morale was down. It was gettin'
dialog: ugly in the States. Hell, you
dialog: remember.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Like it was yesterday.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: A couple days later they decided to
dialog: use the Ladder, on one test
dialog: battalion. Yours. Just in an
dialog: infintessimal dose in the food
dialog: supply, to prove its effectiveness in
dialog: the field. They were sure your unit
dialog: would have the highest kill ratio in
dialog: the whole goddamn offensive. And you
dialog: did, too. But not the way they
dialog: tnought.
text: JACOB is beginning to shake. MICHAEL pulls a container of pills out of
text: his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey, want something to calm you down?
dialog: Made 'em myself.
text: JACOB shakes his head no.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: None of us can remember that night. I
dialog: get flashes of it but they don't make
dialog: sense. We saw shrinks for years. But
dialog: nothing they did could ever touch it.
dialog: What happened? Was there ever an
dialog: offensive?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: A couple of days later. It was
dialog: fierce. You guys never saw it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: But there was an attack. I can still
text: see them coming. There was a fight,
dialog: wasn't there?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah. But not with the Cong.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Who then?
text: He hesitates, obviously uncomfortable. His eyes grow puffy. He looks at
text: the river for a moment and then turns to JACOB.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You killed each other.
text: JACOB's mouth drops open. The words hit him like a truck.
scene_heading: EXT. VIETNAM - NIGHT
text: Gunfire explodes in the darkening sky. We are in Vietnam. JACOB is at
text: the bottom of a trench fighting with FRANK. Chaos surrounds them. Men
text: are screaming. The ENEMY is storming at them from the rear. ROD raises
text: his bayonet and jams it into the belly of his ATTACKER. It is only
text: after a series of jabs that he sees it's another American he's killed.
text: ROD's eyes go blank with confusion and terror.
speaker_heading: ROD
dialog: Oh my God! WHAT'S HAPPENING?
text: JACOB looks up from the trench and sees a continuing wave of AMERICAN
text: SOLDIERS bearing down on them. FRANK jumps up, knocking JACOB to the
text: ground and slamming his rifle into JACOB's back. As he spins around
text: JACOB sees another SOLDIER charging at him. His bayonet is aimed at
text: JACOB's stomach. For the first time JACOB remembers the face of his
text: attacker. He is a YOUNG MAN, about 19 years old, clean cut, wearing
text: glasses. The two men stare at each other in terrible confusion. It
text: seems like a moment out of time. And then the SOLDIER lurches forward
text: and rams his bayonet deep into JACOB's abdomen.
text: CUT TO MICHAEL BACK ON THE PIER. JACOB is ashen-faced.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It was brother against brother. No
dialog: discrimination. You tore each other
dialog: to pieces. I knew it would happen. I
dialog: warned them. I WARNED THEM. But I was
dialog: just a hippie chemist, right? Jesus!
dialog: And I helped 'em make the stuff ... I
dialog: talked to the guys who bagged the
dialog: bodies. They're in worse shape than
dialog: you, believe me. They saw what was
dialog: left. It's a blessing you don't
dialog: remember. Of course the brass covered
text: the whole thing up right away. Blamed
text: it all on a surprise attack.
dialog: he pauses)
dialog: I needed to find you. The Ladder was
dialog: my baby.
text: Tears start flowing down MICHAEL's face. He wipes them with his sleeve.
text: It takes him a moment to regain his composure. JACOB is shivering.
text: MICHAEL takes off his jacket, drapes it over JACOB, and leads him to
text: the wooden planks overhanging the water. They sit and gaze at the
scene_heading: JERSEY SHORE.
text: CUT TO A WIDE SHOT OF MICHAEL AND JACOB in pre-dawn light.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I always suspected the effects might
dialog: come back. That's why I had to follow
dialog: you. I had a hell of a time getting
dialog: hold of your records.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: If you knew, why didn't you say
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The truth can kill, my friend. Five
dialog: hundred men died out there. This
dialog: isn't a story they'd ever want out.
dialog: When Paul's car blew up I realized
dialog: the scope of the thing. I knew they
dialog: meant business.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: So why tell me now?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Because I can get rid of the demons.
dialog: I can block the Ladder. I have an
dialog: antidote. We can kill them off,
dialog: chemically speaking. They'll all
dialog: disappear. It's chemistry, my friend.
dialog: I know. I created it. Come with me. I
dialog: can help.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - DAWM
text: JACOB and MICHAEL enter a sleazy HOTEL near the docks, obviously
text: frequented by a gay clientele. JACOB is uncomfortable as they check in.
text: MICHAEL, however, seems to know the ropes. They go to a small room.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You come here often?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sometimes. When it's convenient.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: How do I know this isn't just some
dialog: kind of, you know, seduction or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got
dialog: bigger problems than me.
text: MICHAEL reaches into his pocket and casually extracts a vial.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I came up with the formula back in
dialog: Nam but I never got a chance to use
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Never?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just
dialog: open your mouth and stick out your
dialog: tongue.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your
dialog: head. Come on.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (fearful)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: "Yea though I walk through the valley
dialog: of the shadow of death I shall fear
dialog: no evil," but no one ever said I
dialog: wouldn't be shittin' in my pants
dialog: every step of the way, huh?
text: (JACOB smiles, his mouth
dialog: open)
dialog: Stick out your tongue.
dialog: (JACOB obeys as an
dialog: eyedropper deposits a
dialog: drop of liquid on the
dialog: back of his tongue)
dialog: That'a boy. Now why don't you just
dialog: lie down and relax.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: One drop?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's strong stuff.
text: JACOB stretches out on the bed. He stares up at the ceiling and
text: examines its pock-marked lunar look. Long cracks and shallow craters
text: erode the surface. It is an alien terrain.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I think I'm falling asleep.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Pleasant dreams.
text: The words send a jolt through JACOB's body. He tries to get up but
text: can't. He's frightened.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I can't move.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Just relax.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's happening? Help me.
text: The ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge crevasses
text: tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling. He stares in
text: horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the rupture above him.
text: Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness. Hooved feet and
text: pointed claws clamor to break through.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
speaker_heading: HELP ME!
text: Instantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the vial
text: with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds
text: it over JACOB's mouth.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Take it!
text: JACOB fights him, but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the
text: eyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out, but
dialog: can't.
text: Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break
text: off and collide like continental plates. The collisons wreak havoc on
text: the DEMONS, chopping and dismembering them. Body parts fall from the
text: ceiling like a Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Don't fight it. It's your own mind.
dialog: It's your own fears.
text: Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering like a
text: war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe.
text: It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes. JACOB's
text: eyes stare into the formlessness expanding around him. All space is
text: becoming a dark liquid void.
text: Gradually the liquid grows bluer, clearer. There is an undulating sense
text: to the imagery, a feeling of womb-like comfort. Strange lights appear
text: and sparkle before us like sunlight on the ocean. JACOB is rushing
text: upward, toward the surface.
text: With the delirious sound of water giving way to air, JACOB breaks
text: through. To his amazement, he finds himself floating out-stretched on
text: shimmering sunlit water. Above him are clouds of such wondrous beauty
text: that they cannot possibly be of the earth. Pillars of golden light
text: reach down from the heavens creating a cathedral of light. It is a
text: vision of heaven, a vast, almost mythic paradise. JACOB is awed.
text: A sudden movement catches his attention. He looks over and sees MICHAEL
text: standing before him. Only MICHAEL looks different. His face seems to
text: radiate an inner light, a transcendental beauty. JACOB is nearly
text: blinded by his presence and must shield his eyes to look at him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So, how you doin'?
text: The casualness of the words catches JACOB by surprise. He sits up. To
text: his shock and amazement, he finds that he is back in THE HOTEL ROOM.
text: MICHAEL is standing at the foot of the bed. JACOB is totally
text: disoriented. His eyes move slowly around the room, taking everything
text: in. He doesn't speak.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It was better than you expected, huh?
text: JACOB just stares at him for a while and then suddenly begins to laugh.
text: It is a huge laugh, full of energy and life.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And no more demons. I told you they'd
dialog: be gone.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't believe this. It's a miracle,
dialog: Michael. A miracle.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Better living through chemistry,
dialog: that's my motto.
scene_heading: EXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY
text: JACOB and MICHAEL are walking through the STREETS OF GREENWICH VILLAGE.
text: It is early MORNING and the sidewalks are bustling with PEOPLE. JACOB
text: stares into their faces and beams when they smile back. MICHAEL enjoys
text: JACOB's happiness.
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY
text: JACOB and MICHAEL walk through WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It was paradise, Michael. You showed
dialog: it to me. You were there.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well that's good to know.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed
dialog: you enough of that stuff to send a
dialog: horse to heaven. I'm just glad you
dialog: came back.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I would have stayed there if I could.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm sure. You've got nothing but
dialog: troubles waitin' for you here.
text: He points to two POLICEMEN on the far side of the SQUARE.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (taking JACOB's arm)
dialog: Come on.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL - DAY
text: The TWO MEN head up to GRAMERCY PARK and stop in front of the GRAMERCY
text: PARK HOTEL. Reaching into his wallet, MICHAEL pulls out a huge stack of
text: credit cards and hands one to JACOB.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Here. I've got every credit card ever
dialog: printed. Take this. Stay here till
dialog: you can arrange to get away. It's on
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No. I couldn't.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What? You want the Plaza? Don't be
dialog: foolish. Here. Take this, too.
dialog: (he pulls out a business
dialog: card)
dialog: This is my place on Prince Street.
dialog: It's got my phone, everything. Call
dialog: if you need me ... but you won't.
dialog: Everything's gonna work out. You just
dialog: get outta town as fast as you can.
dialog: The New York police can be effective
dialog: when they want to be.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't know what to say.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Save the words ... Just send back my
dialog: credit card.
text: MICHAEL laughs, hugs JACOB, and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: JACOB is in a lovely MOTEL ROOM overlooking GRAMERCY SQUARE. He is
text: sprawled out happily on the bed when there is a knock at the door. He
text: jumps up and opens it. JEZZIE is standing there. She looks at JACOB
text: quizzically. He smiles and takes her in his arms, swinging her into the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: What are you doing here? Are you all
dialog: right? How do you expect to pay for
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: (JACOB smiles)
dialog: Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I
dialog: dodged people all over the place,
dialog: reporters, police. I don't know what
dialog: you're gonna do.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm gonna make love to you. That's
dialog: what I'm gonna do.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Are you out of your mind?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: God, I can't keep up with all your
dialog: changes.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Me neither.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: What's gotten into you?
text: JACOB grins.
text: CUT TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in bed gently caressing one another. For
text: all his ardor JACOB is exhausted from the events of the preceding day.
text: While stroking JEZZIE's hair he begins to fall asleep. JEZZIE crawls on
text: top of him and shoves her hand down his pants. JACOB smiles.
text: DISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE making love.
speaker_heading: TIME CUT:
text: DISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in front of the T.V. watching a
text: romantic movie. JEZZIE snuggles up to JACOB.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: It's amazing, you know, that a drug
dialog: could change things like that,
dialog: destroy a life and then give it back.
dialog: It's hard to believe that the world
dialog: could be so hellish on day and like
dialog: heaven the next.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I tell you, it was so wonderful. I
dialog: felt like a little boy. I saw
dialog: Paradise, Jezzie.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: It's so hard to believe.
text: There is a knock at the door. JACOB throws on a bathrobe. JEZZIE jumps
text: under the sheets.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Who's there?
speaker_heading: BELLBOY (V.O.)
dialog: It's your dinner, sir.
text: JEZZIE's eyes brighten. JACOB opens the door. A BELLBOY wheels in a
text: table set for dinner. He sets it in a corner of the room. JEZZIE jumps
text: out of bed, runs to the table, sniffs at the food, and squeals
dialog: excitedly.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever
dialog: since I was a little girl. I never
dialog: thought it would happen.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Stick with me, kid.
text: JEZZIE smiles.
speaker_heading: TIME CUT:
text: DISSOLVE to JACOB and JEZZIE sitting next to a large window overlooking
text: GRAMERCY PARK. They are sipping champagne.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever
dialog: you go.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It's not practical, Jez. It'll be
dialog: hard enough alone.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I can waitress. I'm good.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll
dialog: send for you.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Bullshit!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I promise.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the
dialog: only one left. I don't want to expose
dialog: you to that. It's not right for you
dialog: or me. Be reasonable.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ...
dialog: You're gettin' me angry.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I love you when you're angry.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Oh yeah?
dialog: (her eyes twinkle
dialog: suggestively)
dialog: Try leavin' without me.
text: JACOB laughs. JEZZIE doesn't. Unexpectedly she grabs JACOB and pushes
text: him onto the bed. In seconds they are all over each other, their
text: clothes flying in all directions. They seem as happy as could be.

scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY
text: JACOB enters GRAND CENTRAL STATION. He checks out all the PEOPLE around
text: him. Not a DEMON in sight. Hurrying to the TICKET WINDOW he gets in
text: line. The TICKET SELLER looks up.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Chicago. One way. For tomorrow.
speaker_heading: SELLER
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: One.
speaker_heading: SELLER
dialog: That'll be $119.75.
text: JACOB pulls out MICHAEL's credit card. The SELLER rings it up. While he
text: is waiting JACOB notices a POLICEMAN looking at him. The stare
text: unsettles him. The SELLER hands JACOB his ticket. He takes it and
text: hurries into the CROWD. Looking back he notices the POLICEMAN is
text: following him.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY
text: JACOB enters the MEN'S ROOM. He hurries into one of the stalsls, drops
text: his pants, and sits. He eyes the graffiti on the walls and then notices
text: a wad of tissue stuffed into a hole between him and the next stall. It
text: is moving. Suddenly the tissue falls to the floor. JACOB glances at the
text: hole curiously and leans forward to examine it. He is shocked to see an
text: eye staring back at him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Goddamn it!
dialog: (he covers it with his
text: hand. A pencil jabs his
dialog: palm. He yells)
dialog: Fucking pervert.
text: Two lips form around the hole. A tongue wags obscenely.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Dream on!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: What?!
text: The mouth is gone. JACOB hears the stall door fly open and feet running
text: from the room. He jumps up and grabs his pants. He dashes out of the
text: MEN'S ROOM. He hears footsteps and chases after them.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY
text: JACOB bursts into the MAIN TERMINAL. He sees someone rushing toward the
text: main doors and speeds after him. HOMELESS PEOPLE, huddling along the
text: corridors, watch as they run past. Escaping to the street, the MAN
text: disappears in the holiday throngs. JACOB, crazed, stands gasping for
text: breath. His fists dig into his coat pocket. Suddenly he feels something
text: and seems surprised when MICHAEL's CARD emerges in his hands.
speaker_heading: OMIT
scene_heading: INT. SOHO LOFT BUILDING - EVENING
text: JACOB runs up the stairs in a SOHO LOFT BUILDING. It is a dingy,
text: industrial staircase, poorly lit. He reaches a door with MICHAEL's name
text: painted on it in large black letters. He knocks loudly. There is no
text: answer. He pounds on it. Another door opens on the floor above. A head
dialog: sticks out.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You lookin' for Mike?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (panting hard)
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Don't know. Hasn't picked his mail up
dialog: in days. It's not like him.
text: JACOB has a frenzied look in his eyes. He searches around the staircase
text: and sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner. He grabs a two-by-four
text: and lunges at the door.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
text: JACOB doesn't answer. He smashes wildly at the door until the lock
text: flies open.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S LOFT - EVENING
text: JACOB charges into the dark space groping for a light. He finds it. The
text: LOFT is a disaster area. Nothing is standing. JACOB runs from room to
text: room. In the back he discovers a large private chemistry lab. Glass
text: vials and bottles are shattered on the floor.
text: JACOB rifles through the cabinets. A few bottles are intact but their
dialog: labels mean nothing to him.
text: He reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid oozing out from
text: the bottom. He opens it. MICHAEL's severed head stares him in the face.
text: It is smiling.
text: A scream rings out as the MAN from upstairs sees what JACOB has seen.
text: JACOB jumps back, trips, and falls over MICHAEL's headless body. It is
text: lying sprawled across the floor.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Oh my God!
text: JACOB stumbles to pull himself up. He is in a state of unrelieved
text: panic. He runs past the MAN and spills out the doorr. He takes two and
text: three stairs at a time, nearly flying to the street.
scene_heading: EXT. SOHO STREETS - NIGHT
text: JACOB rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the sidewalk as fast
text: as his legs will move. With unexpected violence he charges into the
text: side of a building. Over and over he hurls himself against it. He grabs
text: for the bricks. His fingers insert themselves into the crevices. It is
text: as though he is trying to merge with the wall.
text: Suddenly JACOB turns and dashes into the street. A taxi is speeding
text: toward him, its lights the only sign of life and warmth in the dark
text: night. JACOB steps into its path. It is hard to tell if he is trying to
text: stop the cab or waiting to be hit. The taxi screeches to a halt. JACOB
text: stares at it a moment and then steps to get in. The DRIVER tries to
text: pull off but JACOB yanks at the door and drags himself inside.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - NIGHT
text: Rain is beginning to fall. It streaks the windows.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: I'm going to Brooklyn.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Sorry, Mac. Not with me you're not. I
dialog: get lost in Brooklyn.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I know the way.
text: JACOB reaches into his pants pocket, pulls out a twenty dollar bill,
text: and hands it to the DRIVER. He takes it.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Look, this is all the money I've got
dialog: in the world. Take me home and it's
dialog: yours.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: ... Where's your home?
text: CUT TO THE TAXI heading down WEST BROADWAY, approaching the BROOKLYN
text: BRIDGE, crossing the EAST RIVER, and driving through dark BROOKLYN
speaker_heading: STREETS.
text: JACOB's face passes in and out of dense shadows. Every time he is
text: bathed in light his image seems to alter. Something in him is falling
dialog: away.
scene_heading: EXT. SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: JACOB gets out of the TAXI and approaches the LOBBY of SARAH'S
text: APARTMENT BUILDING. JACOB is greeted by the DOORMAN.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (greeting him warmly)
dialog: Hello, Sam.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
speaker_heading: (noticing JACOB's
dialog: battered condition)
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm okay.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Do you want some help? I can call
dialog: upstairs.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No, don't. But thanks.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: JACOB stops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his hand
text: underneath a section of the hallway carpet. It comes back with a key.
text: He inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door. He calls out.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hello. It's me.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Some lights are on. The APARTMENT looks comfortable and cozy.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hello? Is anybody home? Jed? Eli?
dialog: Daddy's here.
text: There is still no answer. JACOB is surprised. He peers into the dark
text: LIVING ROOM and then walks to the KITCHEN. No one is around. A photo of
text: JACOB, SARAH, AND THEIR BOYS is sitting on the counter. He picks it up
text: and carries it with him through the apartment. He walks into his old
text: BEDROOM and then into the BOYS' ROOM. The beds are still unmade. There
text: is no one home. He sees his image in the BATHROOM mirror and turns away
text: in disgust. He walks back to the LIVING ROOM. He is about to switch the
text: lights on when he hears footsteps coming down the hall. He calls out.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Sarah, is that you? I hope you don't
dialog: mind. I needed to come home.
text: JACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room. She does not seem he
text: usual self. She appears larger, more imposing.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Hello, Jake. I knew you'd come here
text: in the end.
text: JACOB is nervous.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What're you ... ? Where's Sarah?
dialog: Where are the boys?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Sit down, Jake.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Sit down.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No! What's going on? Where's my
dialog: family?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
text: It's over, Jake. It's all over.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where have they gone?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Wake up. Stop playing with yourself.
dialog: It's finished.
text: JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening, powerful glare. The edge of
text: her coat rustles and flutters as she moves toward him. It is an
text: innocent sound at first, but after a moment it transforms into
text: something else, an obsessive flapping noise, the sound of a wing.
text: JACOB's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor. His legs are
dialog: shaking.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Your capacity for self-delusion is
dialog: remarkable, Dr. Singer.
text: JEZZIE begins walking around the dark living room as she talks to him.
text: Something about her walk is very unnatural. JACOB eyes her fearfully.
text: In the darkness JEZZIE's movements become increasingly strange and
text: elusive. We see her pass before a shadow and disappear within it, only
text: to reappear, seconds later, in a doorway on the other side of the room.
text: JACOB spins around, confused. Suddenly JEZZIE is inches from his face,
text: although it seems like there has been no time for her to get there. Her
dialog: movements are totally impossible, defying all logic, all physical laws.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's wrong, Jake?
dialog: (she mocks him)
dialog: Forget to take your antidote?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Who are you? What are you doing to me?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved
dialog: your friends. That chemist - the
dialog: Ladder. What an imagination you have!
text: JACOB freezes.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And your vision of paradise ...
dialog: fantastic! You're a real dreamer, you
dialog: know that? Only it's time to wake up.
text: JEZZIE has disappeared in the darkness of the room. Only the sounds of
text: flapping wings remain. They grow louder and more menacing, whooshing
text: past him with no visible source.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Your mind is crumbling, Jake. No more
dialog: "army." No more conspiracies. You're
text: dying, Dr. Singer. It's over.
text: JACOB, frightened, turns toward the door as if to hurry out. "JEZZIE"
dialog: laughs.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Where's to run, Jacob? Where's to go?
text: JACOB pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror behind him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: WHO ARE YOU?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: How many times have you asked me
dialog: that? How many times?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (with consummate power)
dialog: YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
text: JEZZIE appears from the shadows. Her coat collar obscures her and it
text: seems for a moment that she has no face. Then, to JACOB's horror, she
text: turns around. He is staring at the vibrating creature he has seen so
text: often before. Glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror,
text: dark and undefinable. Its face is a black and impenetrable void in
text: constant vibration. Its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry, the
text: essence of fear and suffering. JACOB pulls away from it, overhwelmed by
text: confusion. He is rooted in fear.
text: A sudden wind howls through the room, great gales blowing JACOB's hair
text: straight up. It is like a hurricane pushing him into the wall. He can
text: barely stand. He struggles to pull himself away. The flapping sound
text: returns, charging at him from all directions. It is as if the darkness
text: itself is swooping down, trying to envelop him.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (whispering to himself)
dialog: This isn't happening.
text: New terrible sounds arise, chain saws slashing through the air, knives,
text: and sabers ripping through space with unrelenting anger. Guns fire and
text: explode past his head. It is as though all the sounds of destruction
text: are closing in on him. JACOB yells but his own voice is lost in the
text: melee. Terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help.
text: Suddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as if from a
text: distance. It is LOUIS. JACOB is shocked to hear him. He stands
dialog: motionless.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (V.O.)
dialog: If you're frightened of dying you'll
dialog: see devils tearing you apart. If
dialog: you've made your peace then they're
dialog: angels freeing you from the world.
text: The voice fades. JACOB just stands there, not sure what to do. And then
text: the sounds return. Only now they are more terrifying than ever.
text: Hideously loud, they become a cacophony of sounds, voices of parents,
text: friends, lovers, the sounds of battle, fighting, and dying.
text: JACOB looks up and sees the creature in the center of the room. All the
text: sounds seem to emenate from it. The more JACOB stares at it the louder
text: they become. After a moment, JACOB takes a huge breath. We sense a
text: great resolve forming inside him. Then, slowly, courageously, he begins
text: moving toward it.
text: NEw and more terrifying noises assault JACOB, attempting to drive him
text: back, but he will not be stopped. He continues walking toward the
dialog: creature.
text: In the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor. It rolls
text: back and forth like a living thing, with a maddening hypnotic
text: regularity. Doors slam open and closed, unlatching, snapping, shutting,
text: with deafening force. The room itself seems like an organic presence.
text: It is alive, angry, and threatening.
text: The CREATURE sits in the midst of the insanity like the source of
text: madness itself. It writhes, contorts and vibrates with unstoppable
text: fury. JACOB, terrified, but unrelenting, continues to approach it.
text: AS THE CAMERA DRAWS CLOSER TO THE CREATURE'S HEAD the density of its
text: featureless form overwhelms the screen. It is like staring into
text: emptiness itself, the ultimate darkness.
text: With superhuman effort JACOB grabs hold of the creature. It is like
text: grabbing hold of a live wire. His body begins shaking uncontrollably
text: like a man being electrocuted. He is flying in all directions but does
text: not let go. His fingers claw at the creature's head. JACOB struggles
text: defiantly with the monster.
text: Suddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FIGHTING!
text: JACOB does not respond. It cries out again.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
speaker_heading: FIGHTING?
text: Deep inside the darkness JACOB begins to make out the presence of a
text: form, something writhing and tortured lurking before us. It looks
text: briefly like an animal until we realize it is the image of a human
text: face. It is covered by a dark suffocating film, like a mask.
text: JACOB digs into it with all his might and pulls it off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: DEAD SILENCE as JACOB SEES HIS OWN FACE staring back at him from
text: beneath the mask. It is JACOB SINGER as we first saw him on the
text: battlefield in Vietnam. Only now his image is pale and lifeless. It
text: takes JACOB a moment to realize that he is dead. The recognition is one
text: of terrible confusion and pain. JACOB stares at himself for a long time
text: as a huge cry wells up inside him. It bursts forth with devastating
dialog: sadness.
text: As that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a flash of
text: catacylsmic power. Hundreds of images from JACOB's life flash before
dialog: us, his birth, his childhood, his adulthood. The demons, the room,
text: JEZZIE, LOUIS, MICHAEL, SARAH, all seem to assail us in a rush of
dialog: blinding intensity.
text: We are flying over a landscape of memories, zooming across a constantly
text: changing field of images. Some of the images move, some of the people
dialog: in them speak. They are not particularly significant memories, in some
text: ways they are quite banal, but something about them is infused with
text: life and joy. Even the painful moments resonate with vital force. Some
dialog: of the moments we recognize from the time we've spent with JACOB. Some
dialog: we have not seen before. There is no order to them, no logic to why
dialog: they have been recalled.
text: A newborn baby takes its first breath and screams. SARAH pulls clothes
text: off a clothes line on a rainy day. JACOB's FATHER stands in the Florida
text: surf as sea foam laps gently at his legs. PAUL, FRANK, and JACOB play
text: cards on the edge of a rice paddy. GABE rides his bike into the path of
text: an oncoming car. A child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal,
text: listening to it talk. A young girl standing in a doorway lifts up her
text: blouse to show her new breasts. JACOB and SARAH slice a wedding cake
text: that topples to the floor. JEZZIE looks at JACOB and asks "Love me a
dialog: little?"
text: And then it is over. Total silence overwhelms the screen, a wonderful
text: soothing calm. JACOB's eyes open and he is shocked to find himself
text: sitting on the floor in SARAH's apartment. He is all alone. The first
text: rays of early morning sunlight are filtering through the window.
text: Something about the apartment seems transfigured, magical. JACOB sits
text: motionless, stunned to be back there.
text: The faint sound of music can be heard coming from the hallway. It is
text: warm and familiar, the tinkling of a music box. JACOB listens to it for
text: a few moments and then something registers inside him. Curious, he gets
text: up and approaches the corridor.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hello?
text: There is no response. Suddenly the music stops. JACOB freezes for a
text: moment. He sees someone standing in the shadows at the other end.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Who is it? Who's there?
text: Tentatively JACOB moves forward. As he draws closer he begins to see
text: the outline of a child. Then, all of a sudden, he realizes who it is.
text: His eyes well up as he stands there, the full impact of the moment
text: registering inside him. It's his son, GABE. He is carrying the same
text: musical lunch box we have seen before. The young boy smiles warmly at
text: his father. It is the smile of an angel. JACOB swallows hard.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Gabe? Gabe!
text: JACOB runs to his son. Unable to hold back the tears, he embraces him
text: in a rush of love and emotion.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Gabe. Oh God. I don't believe ...
text: They hug one another over and over. JACOB, overcome, sits down on the
text: stiars. After a moment GABE puts his arm around his father's shoulder
dialog: in a gesture of surprising maturity and compassion. We sense for an
text: instant that their roles have reversed. GABE reaches for JACOB's hand
text: and gently encourages him to stand up.
text: With a sweet tug GABE leads his father up the steps.
text: Sunlight streams down from the top of the stiars, hitting the first
text: landing. GABE is bathed in its warm glow. As JACOB reaches the landing,
text: he too is surrounded by the comforting light.
text: GABE hurries up the last set of stairs. JACOB turns to follow but is
text: stunned by the brilliance of the light pouring in from above.
text: Squinting, he cannot see his son. Then suddenly GABE steps back out of
text: the light and takes his father's hand once more. His eyes sparkle with
dialog: excitement.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Come on Dad ... You know what we've
dialog: got? A sandbox just like the
dialog: Williston's, only it's bigger and the
dialog: sand's all white. You won't believe
dialog: it.
text: JACOB smiles at his son. GABE smiles at him. It is a moment of total
text: euphoria. THE CAMERA HOLDS as they continue up the stairs.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And my parakeet. Remember, the one
dialog: grandma let out of the cage? He's
dialog: okay. And he's talking now. He knows
dialog: my name.
text: GABE's voice slowly trails off as he and his father disappear in the
text: intenstity of the light. THE CAMERA HOLDS on the image. For a brief but
text: stunning moment there appears to be a huge ethereal staircase
text: shimmering before us. It rises up into infinite dimensions. Then the
text: brilliance of its blinding light overwhelms the screen.
text: Suddenly the brightness condenses into a smaller light source. It holds
text: for a second and then flashes off. An overhead surgical lamp remains
text: stubbornly in view.
scene_heading: INT. VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY
text: A DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his mask. His
text: expression is somber. He shakes his head. His words are simple and
dialog: final.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: He's gone.
text: CUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large ARMY FIELD
text: TENT in VIETNAM. The DOCTOR steps away. A NURSE rudely pulls a green
text: sheet over his head. The DOCTOR turns to one of the aides and throws up
text: his hands in defeat.
text: AN ORDERLY wheels JACOB's body past rows of other DOCTORS and NURSES
text: fighting to save lives. A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY pulls back a screen door
text: to let them out of the tent. It is a bright, fresh morning. The sun is
dialog: rising.

scene_heading: INT. CITY COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY
text: CUT TO a huge ampitheatre-style LECTURE HALL at CITY COLLEGE. It
text: is almost empty. No more than FORTY STUDENTS are scattered near
text: the front of nearly three hundred seats. All are listening to
text: PROFESSOR EMANUEL STERN who is nearing the end of his lecture.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Thus at the core of today's discu-
dialog: sion we find four fundamental doc-
dialog: trines. First, that the world of
dialog: matter and individual consciousness
dialog: are both manifestations of one Divine
dialog: Reality.
text: One of the STUDENTS seems about to fall asleep and keeps nodding
dialog: his head.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Even you, Mr. Palmer, are part of it,
dialog: as amazing as that may seem.
text: MR. PALMER sits up quickly in his seat as other STUDENTS smile.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Second, human beings are capable not
dialog: only of kowledge about this Divine Re-
dialog: ality by inference but can realize
dialog: its existence by direct intuition,
dialog: superior even to reason.
text: A door opens in the upper reaches of the lecture hall. JACOB
text: enters and walks quietly down the stairs to within hearing range
dialog: of the professor.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Third, man possesses a double nature,
dialog: an ego and an eternal self, what we
dialog: call "spirit" or "soul."
text: JACOB takes a seat at one of the desks. There is a pencil lying
text: on it which he fingers distractedly.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Fourth, and most important, man's
dialog: life on earth has only one end and
dialog: purpose, to learn to let go of the
dialog: separate ego and to identify with the
dialog: Divine spark within.
text: MR. PALMER is nodding off again.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Almost impossible to believe, isn't
dialog: it Mr. Palmer, that somewhere in that
dialog: unconscious head of yours lies the
dialog: source of all consciousness?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Yes, Sir. Very hard.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: (nodding his head)
dialog: Well now, having reached this
dialog: apotheosis there seems little, if
dialog: anything, left to say. So rather than
dialog: try, you are dismissed.
text: The STUDENTS seem surprised but not unhappy with the sudden
text: dismissal. They quickly gather their books and begin the long
text: climb to the exits. Only JACOB remains seated.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hello Prof.
text: PROFESSOR STERN looks up and stares at KACOB for several seconds
text: before recognizing him.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: My oh my. Doctor Singer. Isn't this a
dialog: happy surprise?
text: JACOB comes down the aisle and clasps hands with his old
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: (looking at JACOB's uni-
dialog: form)
dialog: Are you in the service?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: The postal service. I'm a mailman.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: (surprised but non-
dialog: judgemental)
dialog: Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark
dialog: of night ... I always admired that.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: It's good to see you.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Likewise.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY COLLEGE - DAY

text: constitute the CAMPUS of CITY COLLEGE.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (shrugging his shoul-
dialog: ders)
dialog: I haven't seen her in months.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: (understanding)
dialog: Ah!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm with another woman now. We're
dialog: both with the post office, Midtown,
dialog: 34th Street branch.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Hmm. I don't suppose there are too
dialog: many philosophers in the post office?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't
dialog: have their doctorates, that's all.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: Last I heard you were offered a posi-
dialog: tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon
dialog: was it?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh, that goes way back. They had a
dialog: hiring freeze, one of those last min-
dialog: ute things. Bad timing for me though.
dialog: Middle of the war. The draft.
text: (STERN nods his head.
text: They walk a moment in
dialog: silence)
dialog: I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam
dialog: ... I didn't want to think anymore. I
dialog: decided my brain was just too small
dialog: an organ to comprehend this chaos.
speaker_heading: STERN
text: (looking at JACOB with
dialog: affection)
dialog: Jacob, if it was any other brain but
dialog: yours, I might agree.
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: Tell me, does your lady friend know
dialog: what a brilliant thinker, what a sub-
dialog: lime intellect she's living with?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (smiling coyly)
dialog: I doubt it's my mind that interests
dialog: her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery
dialog: lady.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: (with a fatherly
dialog: demeanor)
dialog: Well, try not to get burned. You have
dialog: a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone
dialog: tempt you away from it.
scene_heading: INT. OFF CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: JACOB and PROFESSOR STERN are sitting at a quiet table in a
text: nearly empty coffee shop. They are both fixing cups of tea, not
text: speaking. Suddenly JACOB looks at STERN.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I've got a problem, Prof. More Augus-
dialog: tine than Kierkegaard, if you know
dialog: what I mean.
text: (STERN looks at him
dialog: questioningly)
dialog: I need to know about ... demons.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you
dialog: writing ... ?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No.
dialog: (he pauses a moment)
dialog: I see them.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: See them?
dialog: (he smiles uncomforta-
dialog: bly)
dialog: What do you mean? Physically?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: Yes.
text: STERN pauses. He looks at JACOB. The intensity of his gaze is
text: unsettling and JACOB reaches for his tea. The cup rattles.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: I know very little about demons, Ja-
dialog: cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them
dialog: as literary figures, biblical ones
dialog: ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: this is the 20th Century. We don't
dialog: see demons now.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're
dialog: invading my life.
text: A look of concern fills STERN's eyes.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Christ, I know how it sounds.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Have you considered a doctor? A psy-
dialog: chiatrist?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (suddenly uneasy)
dialog: I don't want them. I'm not looking
dialog: for analysis or drugs. It's too easy
text: to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.
dialog: (he pauses uncomforta-
dialog: bly)
dialog: It's more than that. I can feel it. I
dialog: need you Prof. You're the only one I
dialog: can talk to.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: I don't know what to say.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I need your insight, your intuition.
text: STERN sips his tea slowly. He is thinking.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Demons? I don't know what to tell
dialog: you. It sounds like a spiritual mat-
dialog: ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is
dialog: that you have no context for it.
dialog: You're a renegade Existentialist suf-
dialog: fering demons a hundred years after
dialog: Freud. How the hell am I supposed to
dialog: make it fit?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes
dialog: sense.
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: Please help me.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: (trying to be delicate)
dialog: Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not
dialog: in the empirical sense. I don't be-
dialog: lieve in devils fighting for our
dialog: souls. I don't believe in enternal
dialog: damnation. I don't believe in other-
dialog: worldly creatures tormenting us. We
dialog: don't need them. We do a good enough
dialog: job on ourselves.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (disturbed)
dialog: But I see them.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Look. I don't pretend to know what's
dialog: going on inside your head. For all I
dialog: know it's pathological and they
dialog: should be pumping Valium into your
dialog: veins by the quart. But if you're not
dialog: willing to accept the help of sci-
dialog: ence; and believe me, I admire you
dialog: for that: then you'll have to do bat-
dialog: tle on your own. What can I say? It's
dialog: a lonely pilgrimage through our times
dialog: even for the strongest souls. But to
dialog: be pursued by ... demons no less ...
dialog: There are no guides, Jacob.
dialog: (he muses)
dialog: You wanna know what I'd do if I sud-
dialog: denly started seeing demons? I'd hail
dialog: the first taxi that came along, shoot
dialog: over to Bellvue and beg them for
dialog: shock treatment. I'm no saint.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hell, you think I am?
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: I'venever understood you, you know
dialog: that? You were by far the best pupil
dialog: I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu-
dialog: ally, you were the most original, the
dialog: most imaginative. Who knows, maybe
dialog: you've been "elected" to see demons.
dialog: Maybe you're in touch with ... some-
dialog: thing. Nothing would surprise me
dialog: about you Jacob. Nothing.
text: JACOB gazes at his old friend and mentor, frustration blazing in
text: his eyes. They are both surprised to see tears form and run down
text: his cheek. JACOB reaches for a napkin and dries them quickly.
text: STERN, uncomfortable in the face of emotion, turns away.

scene_heading: ADDENDUM 2: THE PARTY AT DELLA'S
dialog: ---
text: Suddenly a strange and terrifying spectacle unfolds before him.
text: The DANCERS undergo a shocking transformation, a full three-
text: dimensional alteration of their physical forms. Clothes fuse to
text: their bodies like new skin. Horns and tails emerge and grow like
text: exotic genitalia, exciting a frenzy among the DANCERS. New
text: appendages appear unfolding from their flesh. Dorsal fins
text: protrude from their backs. Armored scales run in scallops down
text: their legs. Tails entwine sensuously. Long tongues lick at the
text: undersides of reptilian bellies. The metamorphosis holds a
text: biological fascination. Bones and flesh mold into new forms of
dialog: life, creatures of another world.
text: CUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He
text: stares at the DANCERS. They are perverse, corrupt aspects of
text: their normal selves. He is mesmerized by JEZZIE. Her flesh has
text: grown hard and wrinkled and has the markings of a snake. Her
text: tongue, long and curled, darts in and out of her mouth
text: repeatedly. Her eyes are thin and domineering. They lock JACOB in
text: their gaze. He wants to stop, to run, but JEZZIE won't release
dialog: him.
text: JACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from
text: them but it won't go away. The music throbs. His actions become
text: spastic, almost delirious. His hysteria attracts the attention of
text: the other DANCERS.
text: A circle forms around JACOB and JEZZIE as their frenzy transcends
text: the boundaries of dance and erupts into an almost orgiastic
text: display. JACOB is out of control. His fury becomes a kind of
text: exorcism, a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and
dialog: his mind.
text: CUT TO JACOB as his eyes pass beyond pain. The dark walls of the
text: APARTMENT fade away.
scene_heading: EXT. VIETNAM - NIGHT
text: Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness,
text: outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a large
text: cloud. The faces are looking down and voices are speaking.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: He's burning up.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Total delirium.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: He'll never make it.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: That's some gash. His guts keep
text: spilling out.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Push 'em back.
speaker_heading: JACOB (V.O.)
dialog: (crying weakly)
dialog: Help me!
text: His eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emanate from it
text: filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw
text: us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into
text: exhilarating speed. The rush causes them to flash
text: stroboscopically and produce a dazzling, almost sensual, surge of
text: color. The display is spectacular and compelling. A voice can be
text: heard in the distance.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I think we're losing him.
text: Suddenly the flickering rings begin to define a tangible image, a
text: kind of CELESTIAL STAIRCASE, rising up into infinite dimensions.
text: As we speed toward it, it grows increasingly majestic. The image
dialog: is so awesome and other-worldly that it is difficult to grasp
dialog: what is being seen.
text: Music can be heard in the distance. It too is celestial in its
text: beauty. Then, unexpectedly, it grows hard and insistent, like a
text: heartbeat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The image of
text: the STAIRCASE shatters and disappears, replaced by intense
text: flashes of red and blue light. The music grows louder and reaches
text: a thundering crescendo. Then silence.

scene_heading: ADDENDUM 3: JACOB'S LIVING ROOM
dialog: ---
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: CUT TO APPLAUSE from a real television game show as JACOB
text: switches channels on the LIVING ROOM T.V. He stops on an
text: interview program, turns up the sound, and runs to the BATHROOM.
text: The CAMERA stays on the television. JACOB can be heard urinating
text: in the distance.
text: MAC HAYES, a young, virile, and smug REPORTER is speaking.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: The Reverend Norman Murphy, leader of
dialog: one of the largest groups supporting
dialog: the Armageddon Committee, told our
dialog: cameras that we are no longer dealing
dialog: in decades but years.
text: THE REVEREND fills the T.V. screen.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: The battleground is being readied.
dialog: Our planet is the battlefield. Our
dialog: souls are the prize. All the signs
dialog: point to the inevitable confrontation
dialog: between the forces of good and evil.
dialog: People must choose sides. There is no
dialog: draft evasions in this war. All are
dialog: called. All must take up weapons. Are
dialog: you prepared? That's the question we
dialog: ask.
text: The toilet flushes and JACOB walks back into the LIVING ROOM and
text: turns down the sound.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: Do you find people scoffing at you,
dialog: Reverend? After all, there have been
dialog: doomsayers for thousands of years and
dialog: we're still here.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: People are less apt to laugh these
dialog: days. The prophecies are too close
dialog: for comfort. I mean, all you have to
dialog: do is watch the news.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: There are some who claim that your
dialog: pessimism is defeatist and what the
dialog: world needs now is hope, a positive
dialog: thrust.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: I think the time for hope has passed.
dialog: The seeds have been planted. We shall
dialog: reap what we've sown.
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: Pessimists, no. I think we are
dialog: percieved as the only realists
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: HAYES
dialog: Other movement leaders agree. In an
dialog: interview ...
text: Suddenly the telephone rings. It startles JACOB. He jumps. It
text: rings again. He reaches down, turns off the T.V., and picks up
text: the phone. His eyes continue to stare at the blank screen as he
dialog: talks.

scene_heading: ADDENDUM 4: JACOB'S BEDROOM
dialog: ---
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: THE BEDROOM is dark. JACOB and JEZZIE are making love. A half-
text: smoked joint is smouldering in an ashtray by the bed. JEZZIE is
text: poised on top of JACOB and his eyes are focused on her face.
text: A hurricane lamp casts a warm glow over their bodies. Its
text: flickering light plays games with JACOB's eyes and for a moment
text: JEZZIE seems to disappear. JACOB reaches out for her breasts and
text: his hands seem to vanish into the shadows dancing across her.
text: With sudden, hallucinogenic impact, JACOB feels himself drawn
text: into a starry universe opening from inside her.
text: THE CAMERA plunges through her image into a galxy of stars and
text: rushes toward one that is twinkling brightly. Pulsations of its
text: light whiten the screen. Out of the whiteness appears a momentary
text: flash of the CELESTIAL STAIRCASE, accompanied by sounds of sexual
dialog: climax.
text: The STAIRCASE sparkles for an instant and then it's gone. The
text: sparkle becomes a glimmer in JEZZIE's eye as her face fills the
text: screen. She looks especially lovely and radiant. Her image moves
text: with the lamplight.
text: JACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply basks in
text: JEZZIE's glow. Slowly, she leans forward and whispers in his ear.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: So tell me ... am I still an angel?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (smiling broadly)
dialog: With wings.
dialog: (he strokes her hair)
dialog: You transport me, you know that? You
dialog: carry me away.

scene_heading: ADDENDUM 5: DEMON IN THE WALL
dialog: ---
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: JACOB is sitting in a comfortable chair in his living room. He is
text: reading. The room is dark, lit only by a reading light. The walls
text: are mostly in shadow. The light, however, falls on one section of
text: the wall, a portion that has been lined in fake wood paneling.
text: JACOB's eyes suddenly lift off the page and roam over the wood
text: grain on the wall. All of a sudden he notices something strange,
text: an image in the grain. He stares at it. The more he stares the
text: more precise its definition. The image of a DEMON appears in the
dialog: wall.
text: JACOB sits up quickly and stares at the walll. It is impossible
text: to get the DEMON's image out of the grain. It seems etched, even
text: imbedded, in the paneling.
text: JACOB looks away and returns to his book. He is reading about
text: archetypes and the primordial mind. But the book does not hold
text: his attention. He is obsessed with the wall. Its molecules seem
text: suddenly active, the wood grain suddenly animate. Layers begin to
text: appear in the surface of the wall as the grain patterns slowly
text: define a rocky, barren landscape.
text: The DEMON is growing solid. Cries and screams rise up in the
text: distance. Flames and a red glow emanate from the space extending
text: rapidly into the wall. The image of Hell erupts before him.
text: JACOB stands up. He can see bodies suffering beyond the wall,
text: masses of PEOPLE wailing and enduring the torments of a fiery
text: world. The DEMON's arm slowly extends from the plane of the wall
text: and reaches into the room. He is huge, covered in flames and
text: skulls, a living horror. He grabs hold of JACOB and pulls him
text: toward the wall. JACOB tries to back away but he cannot. His face
text: is white with fear. The DEMON draws JACOB toward the inferno.
speaker_heading: JACOB
text: (yelling at the top of
dialog: his lungs)
dialog: NO!
text: Suddenly JEZZIE appears, the light from the BEDROOM flooding the
text: paneled wall. The DEMON vanishes instantly.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Jake, are you all ... ?
text: She stops dead in her tracks.
text: CUT TO JACOB pressed up against the wall, defying gravity and
text: logic, as though about to merge with the solid surface. His body
text: holds there for a moment and then collapses to the floor. JEZZIE
text: goes to him.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Jake? Jake?
text: He doesn't answer. He looks at JEZZIE with a blank stare. His
text: body begins shaking.
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: JACOB is lying on the bed, curled up in a fetal pose. JEZZIE is
text: stroking his hair and trying to calm him.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: It's going to be all right, Jake.
dialog: It's going to be all right. Don't be
dialog: afraid. I've got you now.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
text: JEZZIE wraps herself around his shivering body and warms him with
text: her own. The image seems tender and comforting until we notice
text: JEZZIE's tongue darting nervously in and out. It looks strangely
text: like a snake's.
dialog: ---
scene_heading: ADDENDUM 6: THE HOSPITAL
dialog: ---
text: The RESIDENT injects the serum into JACOB's veins while two
text: ORDERLIES hold him still. JACOB barely struggles. His eyes fixate
text: on the EMERGENCY ROOM WALL. It is white and sterile. Within
text: moments it begins to emit a reddish glow. JACOB watches with
text: astonishment as the wall's two-dimensional surface separates into
text: three-dimensional planes. The solid surface gives way to a DARK
dialog: CHAMBER that was not there before.
text: Out of the transmuted space CREATURES begin to form. Bosch-like
text: DEMONS with horns and tails, undeniably of another world. Slowly
text: several of them emerge from the wall and approach JACOB. They
text: look like parodies of doctors and nurses, wearing traditional
text: hospital gowns. Without a word they wheel him through the space
text: where the wall had been. JACOB tries to scream but no sound comes
dialog: out.
scene_heading: INT. HELL - NIGHT
text: The DARK CHAMBER is filled with mournful CREATURES being led by
text: DEMONS through a series of CORRIDORS. No one fights or struggles.
text: JACOB's stretcher is moved through the darkness. He tries to sit
text: up but is forced back down. He is obviously drugged.
text: JACOB is wheeled into a tiny CHAMBER. A number of DEMONS are
text: waiting for him. Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They
text: are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to JACOB's
text: arms and legs. The devices are manipulated smoothly and JACOB is
text: lifted off the stretcher. The chains retract, stretching him
text: spread-eagle in the air. He screams loudly.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh God!
text: The DEMONS laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing.
text: JACOB is left in darkness. The darkness is hallucinogenic. Fires
text: appear beyond the boundaries of the wall; images of Dante's
text: Inferno, souls of the dead in endless torment. JACOB is but one
text: of countless beings sharing a vastness of torment. His own
text: screams for help are lost in the magnitude of voices crying.
text: Suddenly, out of the meancing shadows, a contingent of DEMONS
text: emerges. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They
text: surround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades.
text: JACOB is panting and sweating with fear. For an instant, one of
text: the DEMONS looks like JEZZIE. JACOB calls out to her.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Jezzie! Help me!
text: The DEMONS laugh as she changes form. They take great pleasure in
text: his suffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each
text: utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere
text: and compassionate, taunting and mocking at the same time. The
text: confusion of meanings is a torment of its own.
dialog: ---
scene_heading: ADDENDUM 7: JACOB'S BEDROOM
dialog: ---
scene_heading: INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM
text: JACOB is lying on the floor of his BEDROOM doing exercises for
text: his back. He has several days' growth of beard and does not look
text: well. His mind is drifting and only the occasional pain in his
text: back reminds him of what he is doing. JEZZIE can be heard
text: vacuuming the carpet in the LIVING ROOM. Suddenly the door swings
text: open. The wail of the vacuum cleaner causes JACOB to tense. His
text: eyes drift down from the ceiling. JEZZIE vacuums around him and
text: seems insensitive to his presence.
text: JEZZIE shoves the vacuum cleaner under the bed and hits
text: something. JACOB tightens. She looks and is shocked to discover a
text: can of gasoline and boxes of kitchen matches. It takes her a
text: second to understand the implications of what she has found.
text: JACOB is ready when she begins yelling.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You're completely off your rocker,
dialog: you know that? You'd think you fell
dialog: on your head instead of your back.
dialog: What are you planning to do, burn
dialog: down the apartment along with your
dialog: demons?
text: She begins to remove the gasoline can.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Don't you touch it.
dialog: (he glares at her)
text: JEZZIE lets go of the can and grabs the vacuum. She moves it
text: furiously across the carpet. Suddenly JACOB sees her tongue
text: darting in and out, unconsciously. She looks strange, not human.
text: JACOB freezes. He yells out.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Who are you?
text: The sound of the vacuum cleaner drowns out his voice. He yells
text: again. JEZZIE sees him and turns off the machine. His voice booms
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Who the hell are you?
text: JEZZIE ignores the question and turns the vacuum cleaner back on.
text: JACOB rolls over and pulls out the plug.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Why won't you answer me?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I don't know you.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You've lived with me for two years.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: That doesn't mean shit. Where do you
dialog: come from, huh? And I don't mean
dialog: Indiana.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: What do you want me to say? My
dialog: mother's tummy?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: You know goddamn well what I mean.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You're out of your fucking mind. I'm
dialog: not gonna stand around here gettin'
dialog: interrogated by you.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Well leave then. Go to Hell.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (furious)
dialog: You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think
dialog: you are? I don't deserve this. Who
dialog: takes care of you day and night? Who
dialog: cleans the floor and washes your
dialog: goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it.
dialog: You flip out on your own, you
dialog: ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding
dialog: your hand. I don't want anything to
dialog: do with you, you hear? Nothing!
text: She storms out of the room, kicking the vacuum cleaner as she
text: goes. JACOB can see flashes of her through the open crack of the
text: bedroom door. Occasional curses and epithets hurl through the
text: opening along with a flood of tears.
text: JACOB catches glimpses of her as she grabs her coat from the hall
text: closet and as she pulls her money out of the desk drawer. He can
text: see the lamp as she shoves it to the floor and hears it shatter
text: as she stomps on it with her foot. There is a blur as she heads
text: to the front door and a deafening bang as she leaves.
text: JACOB's eyes drift up to the ceiling. They hardly blink. He
text: stares at the plaster, chipped and cracked, above him. Suddenly
text: the cracks begin to move. JACOB jumps up. A DEMON is
text: materializing over his head. JACOB yells and grabs hold of the
text: extension pole for the vacuum cleaner. With a furious cry he
text: begins jamming it at the ceiling. Rather than blot out the
text: evolving image his attack helps to define it. JACOB slams harder.
text: Plaster and wood lath cover the floor. The DEMON is gone. Panting
text: hard, JACOB reaches for matches and the gasoline can. He stops
text: and stares at them with great intensity.
dialog: ---
scene_heading: ADDENDUM 8: THE ANTIDOTE SEQUENCE
dialog: ---
text: The ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge
text: crevasses tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling.
text: He stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the
text: rupture above him. Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the
text: darkness. Hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (continuing)
speaker_heading: HELP ME!
text: Instantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the
text: vial with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid
text: and holds it over JACOB's mouth.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Take it!
text: JACOB fights him but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the
text: eyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out,
dialog: but can't.
text: Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks
text: break off and collide with one another like continental plates.
text: The collisions wreak havoc on the DEMONS, chopping and
text: dismembering them. Body parts fall from the ceiling like a
text: Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side.
text: Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering
text: like a war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing
text: catastrophe. It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the
text: ceiling explodes.
text: Matter atomizes instantly. Trillions of particles hurl
text: chaotically in all directions. The walls shatter into a dazzling
text: brightness. For a moment there is a sense of intense forward
text: movement, a rush toward oblivion. And then, suddenly, it stops.
text: There is absolute quiet and stillness.
text: JACOB's eyes stare into the formlessness sparkling around him.
text: All space has become a shining void. Gradually faint pastel
text: colors appear like colored molecules, dancing and spinning,
text: redirecting space into new formations. They weave patterns of
text: intricate complexity and stunning beauty.
text: As the colors grow brighter and more vivid their abstraction
text: gives way to solid form. A GARDEN SCENE emerges. It is a GARDEN
text: OF LIGHT, a vast, almost mythic, Rousseau paradise. It radiates
text: an intense shimmering light.
text: JACOB's eyes are cpativated by the vision before him. A sudden
text: movement catches his attention. He looks up and notices MICHAEL
text: still standing beside him. MICHAEL, however, is rapidly changing
text: form. It is a full, plastic, three-dimensional metamorphosis. His
text: very flesh seems to expand and glow with its own inner light. His
text: face shines and radiates an almost transcendental beauty.
text: JACOB is nearly blinded by MICHAEL's presence and must shield his
text: eyes to look at him. MICHAEL smiles an extraordinary and joyous
text: smile that radiates such intense luminosity that JACOB has to
text: squint to see it.
text: Suddenly MICHAEL steps off the ground. He rises into the air and
text: floats above JACOB. JACOB can barely breathe as he watches him.
text: MICHAEL rises into a sky filled with orbs and blazing lights. The
text: lights shine on JACOB's head. He effervesces and shimmers in
dialog: their glow.
text: One of the orbs sends a burst of light exploding over JACOB. So
text: intense is the light that JACOB grabs his eyes. As he opens them
text: again he sees that the GARDEN is fading back into pure light.
text: MICHAEL, too, is fading.
text: Another burst of light and the GARDEN is reabsorbed by the void.
text: Only the brightness remains. It is many seconds before we realize
text: that the HOTEL ROOM is coming together, reconstructed by the
text: light. In moments it is fully formed. Sunlight is pouring through
text: the window. MICHAEL is sleeping lightly in a chair. He hears
text: JACOB stare and sits up.
text: JACOB is sitting on the bed. He does not seem to know where he
text: is. His eyes are filled with awe. They move slowly around the
text: room, taking everything in. He doesn't speak. MICHAEL gets up and
text: sits beside him. He respects his silence.

text: JACOB enters the HOTEL ROOM. JEZZIE is already there watching the

dialog: Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: You can have anything you want.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Then don't bug me.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I'm not bugging you. Come and lie
dialog: down. I'll give you a massage.
text: (she taps the mattress
text: again and JACOB joins
text: her. She unbuttons his
dialog: shirt)
dialog: Where'd you go today?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (evasively)
dialog: Mid-town mostly.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (looking away from her)
dialog: I picked up my ticket.
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (tensing)
dialog: Oh?
dialog: (acting innocent)
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: West.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (growing angry)
dialog: Where's West? New Jersey?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Don't be funny.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: I always liked the West, west of Il-
dialog: linois anyway. But you gotta give me
dialog: time to pack.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Do what? I haven't done a thing.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Don't play games with me. There's
dialog: nothing more to say.
text: There is a quiet rage building in JEZZIE's eyes as she continues
text: to stroke JACOB's chest. He tries to relax and give himself over
text: to the movement of her hand. Silently she leans over and begins
text: licking his stomach. JACOB's eyes close. His stomach hardens. He
text: reaches back and adjusts the pillow beneath his head. Slowly,
text: JEZZIE works her way back up to his chest. Her tongue darts in
text: and out suggestively. He eyes are burning with anger. Her mouth
text: poises itself over his nipple. She toys with it for a few seconds
text: and then chomps down hard. The bite draws blood.
text: JACOB screams. His eyes shoot open. For the flash of an instant
text: he sees a DEMON hovering over him, a hideous horned creature
text: licking his blood. JACOB flies off the bed as the creature hurls
text: to the floor. JACOB is ready to pounce on it when he sees that it
text: is JEZZIE lying at his feet. His head begins reeling. He backs
text: away from the bed, not taking his eyes off JEZZIE for a second.
text: He backs to the closet and grabs his coat.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Jake. What are you doing? Look, I'm
dialog: sorry, I didn't mean to bite. Let me
dialog: get you a towel.
text: JACOB grabs his wallet and his glasses. He backs toward the door.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Jake, don't. You can't leave. You're
text: not seeing things clearly. The drug's
dialog: wearing off.
text: She stands up and begins to approach him. JACOB lifts up a desk
text: chair and holds it in front of him. Blood is running down his
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Jake, don't leave me!
text: JACOB throws the chair at the floor, opens the door, and hurries
text: into the HALLWAY. JEZZIE scurries around the chair and runs to
text: the door. She yells after him, but he is already gone.

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: JACOB stoops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his hand
text: underneath a section of the hallway carpet. It comes back with a
text: key. He inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Hello. It's me.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The lights are on and the APARTMENT looks comfortable and cozy.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Hello? Is anyone home? Jed? Elie? Dad-
dialog: dy's here.
text: There is still no answer. JACOB is surprised. He walks into the
text: LIVING ROOM and then the KITCHEN. No one is around. He walks into
text: his old BEDROOM and then the BOYS' ROOM. He is surprised to hear
text: footsteps coming down the hall. He turns around and calls out.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Sarah, is that you? I hope you don't
dialog: mind. I needed to come home.
text: JACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room. She does not seem
text: to be her usual self. She seems larger, more imposing.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Hello, Jake. I knew you'd come here
text: in the end.
text: JACOB is nervous.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Sit down, Jake.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Sit down!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: No! What's going on? Where's my
dialog: family?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
text: It's over, Jake. It's all over.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Where have they gone?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Wake up! Stop playing with yourself.
dialog: It's finished.
text: JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening, powerful glare. Her
text: lips snarl. Her tongue begins darting in and out, only now it is
text: not a nervous habit but a conscious act. JACOB's body feels the
text: first waves of an inner tremor. His legs are shaking.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What's going on?
text: JEZZIE smiles at him. Her tongue wags and suddenly shoots from
text: her mouth beyond human extension. JACOB recoils.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (whispering to himself)
dialog: This isn't happening.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: Your capacity for self-delusion is
dialog: remarkable, Dr. Singer.
text: JEZZIE's head begins to tighten and squeeze, as though she is
text: suffering from cramps. JACOB watches in horror as her skull gives
text: birth to pointed horns.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh God!
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: What's wrong, Jake?
dialog: (she mocks him)
dialog: Forget to take your antidote?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Goddamn you!
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (smiling and then
dialog: laughing)
dialog: I loved your chemist, Jake. The
dialog: height of fantasy. And your vision of
dialog: paradise.
text: (she laughs with a hu-
dialog: miliating tone)
dialog: A most romantic creation. You're
dialog: quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time
dialog: to wake up.
text: JACOB's eyes are locked on JEZZIE. His mouth is wide open. His
text: body is shaking badly. He tries to back away from her but his
text: legs barely move.
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
text: There is nowhere to run, Jacob.
dialog: You're home.
text: Suddenly the pictures on the wall crash to the floor. Plaster
text: from the ceiling breaks off in huge chunks and slams to the
text: carpet. Light bulbs and lamps explode. JACOB runs to the door. He
text: pulls it open and screams. He is on the edge of a fiery abyss.
text: JEZZIE laughs with a new intensity of demonic force. JACOB spins
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: WHO ARE YOU?
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: How many times have you asked me
dialog: that? How many times?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
speaker_heading: JEZZIE
dialog: (with consummate power)
dialog: You know who I am.
text: Suddenly JEZZIE reaches for her tongue and pulls at it with all
text: her might. It is an act of total, unrelieved grotesqueness. With
text: each yank the horror grows as JEZZIE literally pulls herself
text: inside out before JACOB's eyes.
text: The emerging creature is JEZZIE transfigured, a demonic presence
text: beyond anything we have seen before. It is black and covered with
text: a thick oozing slime. Its head, still recognizable as JEZZIE, is
text: rodent-like, with piercing green eyes and terrible horns
text: protruding from its brow. Its powerful arms have long spiked
text: claws. Its feet are cloven hooves. Extending from its back is a
text: long, thick, muscular tail that whips around the room with
text: devastating force. It throws furniture crashing through the air.
text: A sudden cracking sound emerges from the DEMON's back. Dark forms
text: penetrate the air. JACOB is breathless as huge wings unfold and
text: spread out to the living room walls. The sound of their flapping
text: is deafening. The walls shatter from their blows. As they crumble
text: darkness appears on the other side. There are no other rooms. The
text: VOID envelops them. The INFERNO emerges in all directions. The
text: DEMON roars.
speaker_heading: DEMON
dialog: (with JEZZIE's voice)
dialog: Still love me, Jake?
dialog: (it laughs and reaches
dialog: out to him)
dialog: COME!
text: CUT TO JACOB's face. He has gone beyond fear. An intensity of
text: rage is building in him that we have not witnessed before. His
text: whole image seems transformed by it. He glows like a volcano
text: before it erupts.
text: Suddenly he explodes. The full fury of the Ladder detonates
text: inside him. He yells at the DEMON with all his might.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: NO!!!!!
text: With a power and energy of devastating force he attacks the
text: DEMON. JACOB is battling for his very soul and tears at the DEMON
text: with an animalistic fury that takes it by surprise. Its giant
text: wings flap furiously, lifting them both up off the floor. JACOB
text: keeps fighting. He claws, bites, and rips at the wings,
text: decimating their delicate fabric.
text: The DEMON, shocked, and trying to gain control, crashes up
text: through the last fragments of the ceiling. JACOB does not let go.
text: They burst into the fiery darkness. The room crumbles beneath
text: them and disappears into the void.
text: The abyss opens beneath them. JACOB continues his attack. His
text: legs are locked around the DEMON's waist. His hands dig into her
text: eyes. The DEMON shrieks and surges downward with awesome
dialog: velocity.
text: The DEMON charges into a rocky slope, smashing JACOB into its
text: cliffs. JACOB claws at her wings, shredding as much of them as he
text: can reach. The DEMON takes a huge chunk out of JACOB's arm. JACOB
text: screams, grabs a rock, and shatters the DEMON's teeth. The DEMON
text: falls to the ground. JACOB holds on.
text: All of a sudden the DEMON begins to shrink. JACOB is shocked and
text: struggles to contain it. As it dwindles in size it reorders its
text: shape. Within seconds a powerful INSECT is cupped in his hands.
text: JACOB tries to crush it but it stings with such force that
text: JACOB's entire body recoils. The stinging persists. JACOB hurls
text: himself to the ground on top of his arms to hold the CREATURE
text: down. So massive is the INSECT's attack. however, that JACOB's
text: whole body heaves off the ground with each sting. Then the
text: attacks subside. JACOB waits for the next blow.
text: Suddenly JACOB's body shoots straight up. His hands fly apart as
text: a new life form erupts between them. He holds on tightly as flesh
text: and blood mold and expand between his fingers. The new body takes
text: rapid shape. It is a CHILD. JACOB grasps it with all his might as
text: it completes its identity. He is horrified when he sees it. It is
dialog: his son.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Daddy!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh God!
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: You're hurting me!
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Stop!!!!
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Daddy. Let go.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: What do you want from me?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: LET GO!
text: JACOB does not let up. In an instant his SON explodes into a
text: gelatinous form, constantly undulating and changing shape. Within
text: its translucent mass a new body is forming. JACOB stares at it
text: with growing terror. It is himself. A terrible perplexity fills
text: JACOB's eyes as he struggles to dig in and destroy his own image.
text: He recoils as his own voice calls out to him.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Who the Hell do you think you're
dialog: fighting?
text: The words shock him and for the first time, he lets go.
text: Instantly the image disappears and the jelly-like mass dissolves
text: into an oily liquid rapidly encircling his feet. JACOB looks down
text: at the shallow pool spreading out beneath him. Its surface
text: reflects a smoky, unearthly light.
text: JACOB gazes into the darkness. He is all alone. The quiet
text: overwhelms him. The only sound is his own breath. He looks
text: around, in all directions, but can see nothing. The CAMERA holds
text: on him as he stands waiting for the next assault, but nothing
text: comes. He is left only with his anticipation and with hinself. He
text: stares at the terrible darkness.
text: A subtle phospheresence begins to glow in the liquid beneath
text: JACOB's feet. He steps away from it, but it follows his movement.
text: Suddenly, as if by spontaneous combustion, it bursts into flames.
text: JACOB screams and tries to run but the flames move with him,
text: lapping at his legs. He cannot escape them. As far and as fast as
text: he runs the fire is with him. He yells and cries and screams as
text: the fire eats at his lower limbs. He falls and jumps back up
text: again, his hands charred. His eyes grow wild.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Oh God, help me.
text: Instantly the flames roar and engulf him. It is total
text: conflagration. JACOB's skin blisters and turns black. His flesh
text: crackles. Writhing in pain he runs through the flames but can
dialog: find no freedom from his suffering.
text: All at once JACOB stops running. He throws his hands up into the
text: burning air and stands motionless, in absolute agony. It is a
dialog: gesture of total submission and surrender to forces beyond
text: himself. His flesh bubbles and chars but something is suddenly
text: quiet inside him.
text: Through the flames JACOB's dark form can be seen as it slowly
text: sits down, like a Buddhist monk, in the midst of the holocaust.
text: He appears a figure of sudden nobility as the flames annihilate
dialog: him.
text: Gradually the fire dies. JACOB's body, his flesh like a charred
text: and brittle shell, sits motionless, beyond pain. An orange glow
text: from the embers of his body slowly fades, leaving him in the
text: final darkness.
text: The SCREEN stays dark for as long as possible. Then, slowly, an
text: eerie light appears in an unfamiliar sky. It backlights JACOB,
text: revealing his silhouette. The CAMERA dollies slowly toward him.
text: It approaches the burned and unrecognizable remains of JACOB's
text: face. It is the face of death. The CAMERA holds on the image.
text: Suddenly, with shocking impact, JACOB's eyes move. Within the
text: crumbling shell of a body something is still alive, still
text: conscious. The eyes survey the darkness and the first stirrings
text: of a new light.
text: It is dawn. JACOB's dark remains are suffused by a preternatural
text: glow. Slowly, huge orbs begin to appear on the horizon. JACOB's
text: eyes open to the growing light as they seek out the familiar in
text: the still dark lansdcape. Gradually the orbs begin their ascent
text: like a thousand suns rising at the same time. JACOB's eyes widen
text: as his new world stands revealed. He is sitting in a GARDEN OF
text: LIGHT, the Rousseau paradise he has visited once before.
text: A sudden burst of light fills the sky directly overhead. The
text: vegetation around him is instantly illuminated with its soft
text: glow. Like a gentle breeze MICHAEL descends from the light and
text: stands radiant before JACOB. He smiles and the air itself seems
text: to brighten. MICHAEL quietly approaches JACOB's body.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I am with you, Jacob.
text: JACOB stares at him through dark eyes with a mixture of awe and
dialog: disbelief.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (speaking with a gentle
dialog: compassion)
dialog: It's all right now. It's over. You've
dialog: won. You're here.
text: (JACOB stares at him
text: questioningly. MICHAEL
dialog: reaches out his hands)
dialog: Trust me.
text: Softly MICHAEL places his hands on top of JACOB's head and begins
text: to peel at the charred flesh. Layer by layer he strips it away.
text: Then, with an unexpected gesture, he rips away a whole section
text: with one quick pull. A BLAZE OF LIGHT bursts through the gaping
text: hole in JACOB's head and beams into the air around them. It is an
text: astounding sight.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Come on. Don't make me do it all.
dialog: (his eyes sparkle)
dialog: Stand up.
text: (JACOB's eyes are burst-
dialog: ing with wonder)
dialog: You can do it.
text: Slowly JACOB begins to stir. He moves feebly at first, like an
text: old man. His black flesh creaks and cracks and through each
text: sudden fissure another beam of light blasts out with laserlike
dialog: intensity.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Stop hobbling. Your flesh can't hold
dialog: you anymore.
text: JACOB nods in response and takes a huge, gigantic breath. His
text: lungs expand and suddenly all the old flesh bursts from his body
text: as a radiant being of light breaks through beneath it. JACOB
text: stands transfigured, filled with his own luminosity. His face is
text: like a child's as he stares in amazement at his own hands,
text: glowing with light.
text: MICHAEL directs JACOB's vision to the sunrise. It is majestic,
text: almost Biblical in its grandeur. Great rays of light penetrate
text: vast cloud formations and descend into the GARDEN. Slowly the
text: clouds, as if orchestrated by some higher power, begin to part. A
text: massive light complex emerges from behind them. JACOB watches,
text: awestruck, as the CELESTIAL STAIRWAY stands revealed. It reaches
text: down from unknown heights, radiating an infinite power and grace.
text: It touches down far in the distance, hovering over many acres of
text: teh GARDEN. JACOB's eyes are filled with its splendor. MICHAEL
text: looks at him and nods.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Go on, Jacob. It has come for you.
text: JACOB cannot speak. His eyes are fixed on the STAIRWAY dazzling
text: him from afar. He can see ANGELIC FORMS moving up and down it.
text: Suddenly, as if transported by light itself, he feels himself
text: floating up into the air. He looks down upon EDEN sparkling below
text: him. His mouth is wide open as he soars above it.
text: The light pulsating from the STAIRWAY is brilliant and thrilling.
text: JACOB's own inner light intensifies as he approaches it. The
text: STAIRWAY grows increasingly wondrous as we draw nearer. It pulls
text: JACOB toward it.
text: STREAMS OF ANGELS enter the STAIRWAY like a fast flowing river.
text: It carries them instantly within its current up beyond the
text: visible reaches of the glittering sky. Billowing clouds glow in a
text: parade of colors and the starry heavens seem to part as the
text: STAIRWAY reaches beyond all known dimensions.
text: JACOB stares at the light that is about to absorb him. It is a
text: moment of total euphoria. He surges into the stream as the
text: brilliant light of the STAIRWAY overwhelms the screen.
text: Slowly the brightness of the screen condenses into a smaller
text: light source. An overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in
dialog: view.
scene_heading: INT. VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY
text: A DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his
text: mask. His expression is somber. He shakes his head. His words are
dialog: simple and final.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: He's gone.
text: CUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large ARMY
text: FIELD TENT in VIET NAM. The DOCTOR steps away. A NURSE rudely
text: pulls a green sheet up over his head. The DOCTOR turns to one of
text: the aides and throws up his hands in defeat.
text: TWO ORDERLIES wheel JACOB's body past rows of other DOCTORS and
text: NURSES fighting to save lives. A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY pulls back
text: a screen door to let them out of the tent. It is a bright, fresh
text: morning. The sun is rising.
