scene_heading: EXT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT
text: Framed in the large picture window stands JACK CARTER,
text: alone, looking out at the night. He turns away as the heavy
text: satin curtains close, wiping him from view.
scene_heading: INT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A blinding beam of light cuts across the room. One
text: pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the
text: opposite end of the room. They show a dowdy group in some
text: anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual
dialog: orgy.
text: GERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa. His young wife, ANNA,
text: is curled up beside him.
text: SID FLETCHER, operating the projector's remote-control,
text: has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother.
text: Jack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair.
text: Clunk. Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting
text: turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged
text: leg. Anna shudders momentarily. She obviously finds his
text: touch repulsive. Carter watches Gerald's hand.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: (removing the cigar
dialog: from his mouth)
text: Bollock naked with his socks still
dialog: on?
speaker_heading: SID
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: They do that up North.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: What for? Protective purposes?
text: He laughs.
speaker_heading: SID
dialog: Ask me?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Ask Jack. It's his old stamping
dialog: ground.
text: Carter turns sharply away to the cocktail cabinet. Lights
text: and sweet music happen when he opens it.
text: Clunk. The slide changes.
speaker_heading: SID
dialog: Must be a bloody contortionist
text: Still looking at the screen, Gerald continues.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: We don't want you to go up the
dialog: North, Jack.
text: Jack and Anna look at each other momentarily. There is
text: definitely something between them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
text: Clunk. The slide changes.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: (groans)
dialog: Not suede boots!
speaker_heading: SID
dialog: Knock it off, Gerald.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: What? And get the clap?
text: Clunk. The slide changes.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: You work for us, Jack. We have
dialog: connections in those parts. I'd
dialog: hate you to screw 'em up.
text: Clunk. The slide changes.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: What's that? A python.
text: Sid laughs raucously. Clunk. The slide changes.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: What are you going for?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: To find out what happened.
text: Clunk. The slide changes.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Some hard nuts operate up there,
dialog: Jack. They won't take kindly to
dialog: someone from London poking his
text: bugle in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Too bad.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: I smell trouble, boy.
text: Clunk. The slide changes.
speaker_heading: SID
dialog: The law was satisfied.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Since when was that good enough?
text: Clunk. The slide changes.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Think again, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I will.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY
text: Express train plunges into a tunnel Blackness.
scene_heading: BEGIN TITLES:
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
text: The compartment is full. Jack Carter sits in one corner,
dialog: reading a Raymond Chandler paperback, Farewell My Lovely.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY
text: The train speeds northwards. In the distance the stacks of
text: a lonely power station belch a continuous stream of brown
dialog: smoke.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Carter steadies himself as he comes along the corridor.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY
text: A massive iron bridge crossing a river whips past. Its
text: mesh sides create an almost hypnotic effect.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN TOILET - DAY
text: Carter tips his head back and dispenses drops into his
dialog: nose.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL TRACK - EVENING
text: The train breaks from another tunnel. Evening light cuts
text: across the track as the train hurtles on.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN RESTAURANT CAR - EVENING
text: Carter pours himself a glass of water and takes out a small
text: phial of brown pills. He swallows one.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL TRACK - NIGHT
text: A chemical factory, brightly lit, passes by and the
text: outskirts of the city appear.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The train moves slowly along the platform and stops. Carter
text: collects his coat and briefcase from the rack.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWCASTLE STATION - NIGHT
text: The street is fairly deserted.
text: Carter exits with other passengers from the train. He pauses
text: and looks about before crossing to the pub opposite.
scene_heading: INT. THE LONG BAR - NIGHT
text: A couple of youths are playing records on the juke box. An
text: old man sits in the corner reading a newspaper.
text: Carter enters through the swing door and a weedy BARMAN
text: comes to serve him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Pint of bitter.
text: The barman picks up a glass mug and begins to draw the
text: beer. Carter snaps his fingers at him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: In a thin glass.
text: The barman sighs petulantly, transfers the beer into a
text: thin glass and puts it on the counter.
text: A telephone rings. The second barman answers it.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: Is there a Mr Carter in the room?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yes.
text: Carter walks to the far end of the bar and picks up the
dialog: receiver.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Margaret?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Why the hell aren't you here?
dialog: (he lights a
dialog: cigarette.)
dialog: What time?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Is Doreen at the house?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Who's with him then?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: When can I see you? Will you be
dialog: there tomorrow?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Now listen, Margaret...
text: The line goes dead. Carter hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT
text: A key hanging inside the letter box starts to move upwards
text: and out through the flap. A moment later, the door opens.
text: Carter is standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs in
text: a worker's terraced house. He closes the door and climbs
dialog: the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT
text: Carter moves cautiously. His eyes scan the peeling
text: wallpaper, the mildew on the banisters. A roof leak hits
text: an unseen bucket with depressing regularity.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: An unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten-up wardrobe, a
text: dressing table and chair are about it. Carter hears a
text: vehicle stopping on the street below. He eases back the
text: ancient net curtain. Two men in a Land Rover are looking
text: up. They see him and quickly drive off.
text: Carter looks around the room. On top of the wardrobe there's
text: an old shotgun. He reaches up and brings it down. Memories
text: flood back. He reaches up again and finds a box of
dialog: cartridges. More memories, jack and Frank grew up here. He
text: leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Pitch black.
text: An overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man FRANK
text: CARTER. He is lying in a coffin. His eyes are closed, his
text: skin made-up, like porcelain.
text: Carter stands over the coffin. He gently touches his
text: brother's crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face.
text: He exits, turning out the light and closing the door.
text: Darkness returns.
scene_heading: INT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT
text: The landlady, EDNA GARFOOT, is climbing the stairs. She's
text: well built, sexy, experienced. Carter follows with his
text: baggage. He watches her appreciatively from behind.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I won't be using the room tonight.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (stops and turns)
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm staying with a friend.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (continuing up the
dialog: stairs)
text: Her husband docks tomorrow, does
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It's not like that, luv.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: It never is.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The door opens and the light goes on. It's a big room
text: overlooking the road, furnished cheaply but comfortably.
text: Edna and Carter enter, talking.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Are you a traveller?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Definitely.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (surveying the room)
dialog: Will this do?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Very nice. (He takes his wallet
dialog: out.) I'll pay you for tonight as
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Don't be bloody silly. You're the
dialog: first since Monday.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You sure?
text: Carter gives her the money.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Ta.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (feeling the mattress)
dialog: I'll bet this one's seen some
dialog: action.
text: Carter smiles and looks straight at her. Edna returns his
text: look, dead pan.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: I'll give you the key when you
dialog: come down.
text: She closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Carter moves around the coffin as he shaves. His electric
text: razor is plugged into the lamp above his dead brother.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The coffin lid is being screwed down.
text: Carter stirs a cup of instant coffee while watching the
text: undertakers at work.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Was he in bad shape?
speaker_heading: UNDERTAKER
dialog: They come worse.
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE - DAY
text: The hearse is parked outside the row of terraced houses. A
text: youthful UNDERTAKER is minding it. He turns and looks
text: through the back window as a young girl walks up the street.
text: DOREEN CARTER is sixteen and, like most girls of her age,
text: tries to look older. She wears all the right gear but it's
text: cheap and doesn't fit properly. Her long hair is lank.
text: There's something sad and embarrassing about her appearance.
text: The young undertaker watches as she enters Frank's house.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The door opens slowly. Doreen stands there looking at the
text: coffin. Carter sees her.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Doreen?
text: She seems mesmerized by what's going on.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: All right, are you?
text: Doreen doesn 't answer.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Been staying with a friend?
text: Doreen nods. The undertaker coughs and thrusts another
text: screw into the coffin.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sorry about your father.
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Tell me, Doreen, did the police
dialog: say anything?
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: (dazed)
dialog: They said he was drunk.
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE - DAY
text: The young undertaker is still in the hearse listening to
text: the radio. In the driving mirror he sees the Land Rover
text: moving slowly tip the road. It stops by the house. Two men
text: suss the scene and drive off.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How's school?
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: I left last year.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Oh, what you doing now?
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: Working at Woolworths.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That must be interesting.
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: Yes.
text: Carter and Doreen look at each other awkwardly.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What you going to do? Live with
dialog: Margaret?
text: Doreen looks at him nervously, shakes her head and fumbles
text: in her bag for a cigarette.
text: Carter continues, slightly indignant.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Well, why won't you come with us
dialog: to South America? My fiancee won't
dialog: mind,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Your dad would have wanted it.
text: The undertaker puts the final screw in.
speaker_heading: UNDERTAKER
dialog: (to colleague)
dialog: Get Hughbert up, will you?
dialog: (to Carter)
dialog: We're ready now, sir.
scene_heading: EXT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The undertakers struggle with the coffin down the narrow
text: staircase into the street. Outside Carter and Doreen wait
text: with two men. EDDIE APPLEYARD, a middle-aged man, is wearing
text: a shabby tweed suit, cap and black tie. KEITH LACEY is a
text: young barman who worked with Frank.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We weren't sure where it was taking
dialog: place, like.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Nice of you to come.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. Frank was a good bloke.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: He was that.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: One of the best.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
text: Through the windscreen of the following limousine Carter
text: can see his brother's coffin in the hearse as it moves
text: slowly through the streets of the city. Sitting in front
text: on fold-out seats are Eddie and Keith.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: I couldn't believe it when I heard.
text: Carter is suddenly attentive.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: I mean, I was surprised when he
dialog: didn't turn up for work. He was
dialog: always on time.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Did you work with him, Keith?
speaker_heading: KEITH
text: At the Half Moon.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (not to be left out)
dialog: It's a bloody funny thing. You
dialog: know a bloke for six bloody years
dialog: and all the time he's as calm as
dialog: gentle Jesus...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: ...then he goes and does a thing
dialog: like that.
text: (he shakes his head.)
dialog: It's a bloody funny thing.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
scene_heading: EXT. CREMATORIUM GATES - DAY
text: As the cortege drives into the crematorium, it passes the
text: Land Rover parked outside. The same two men who passed
text: Frank's house are in it. A long and expensive-looking
text: funeral cortege passes out as they move up the driveway.
scene_heading: INT. CREMATORIUM - DAY
text: Carter, Doreen, Eddie and Keith are in the front pews facing
text: the catafalque on which Frank's coffin rests. The vicar is
text: already midway through the solemn words of the 'committal'
text: when a woman enters. The clunk of her high heels cuts
text: through the silence. Everybody looks round.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (whispering to Doreen)
dialog: Is that Margaret?
text: Doreen nods. Frank's coffin sinks out of sight.
scene_heading: INT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY
text: Two men in long grey coats wait in silence. The coffin
text: appears. Expertly, they take it and swing it on to a
text: trolley. They push it up the wide corridor towards the
text: furnace. One of the men starts whistling cheerfully.
scene_heading: EXT. CREMATORIUM - DAY
text: MARGARET is thirtyish, blonde, attractive in a tarty kind
text: of way. Her heels are too high and she is wearing a cheap
text: pair of sunglasses. She walks quickly away, down the
text: cloisters, past the memorial tablets and urns.
text: Carter comes out of the chapel and sees her.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Margaret.
text: Margaret stops and looks round. Carter joins her. I thought
dialog: you weren't coming.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Changed me mind.
text: They face each other in silence. Margaret looks past Carter
text: and sees Doreen watching them at the end of the cloisters.
text: She turns away and starts walking slowly. Carter moves
text: with her. Margaret continues nervously.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Everyhing go off all right?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Fine...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I want to talk to you.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Doreen.
text: Margaret stops in her tracks and looks back at Doreen.
text: She's still watching them.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (adamantly)
dialog: She's nothing to do with me.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: What do you mean? You've been
dialog: Frank's bird ever since her mother
dialog: cleared off. You're closer to her
dialog: than anyone.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: No. No. It's not like that. I've
dialog: got a husband, you know.
text: Margaret starts walking again, fast.
text: Carter catches hold of her arm and stops her.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hold it! Hold it!
dialog: (looking her in the
dialog: eye)
dialog: Who killed Frank, Margaret?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Killed? I don't know anything
dialog: about it.
text: She moves off rapidly. Carter catches up with her.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I must go. I'm in a hurry.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I want to talk to you later.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Tomorrow morning, then?
text: Margaret dithers.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well, all right then. Twelve o'clock
text: on the Iron Bridge.
text: Margaret walks off as calmly as she can, her high heels
text: clicking as she goes. Carter watches her disappear. Doreen
dialog: watches too.
scene_heading: INT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY
text: Frank's coffin is slid inside the furnace. Flames start to
text: lick it as the steel trap closes.
scene_heading: INT. THE HALF MOON PUB - DAY
text: It's a large room with a horseshoe bar in the centre, a
text: real boozer. A handful of hard drinkers are already in
dialog: position.
text: Carter, Doreen, Keith and Eddie are sitting alone. Their
text: table is already covered with glasses. Doreen appears to
text: be slightly drunk on Babycham, Eddie on whisky and Keith
text: on beer. Carter is stone-cold sober.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: Absent friends.
text: (He raises his glass
dialog: and drinks, then
dialog: continues
dialog: thoughtfully.)
dialog: You don't think he might have done
dialog: it on purpose?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: What? You mean, like, kill himself?
text: Eddie and Keith look at each other.
text: Doreen watches them. She is getting very upset by the
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Naw. Frank? Kill himself? You what?
text: Carter stares at Keith, who is getting uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: I mean, what for?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's what I was wondering.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Come off it. Frank was... well...
dialog: straight. He had no worries I know.
dialog: Hell, we worked together every day
dialog: for a year. It would have showed.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why would it?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: It just would. He was always the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Since when did he drink whisky?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Don't know.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Nobody seems to know.
text: Doreen is now crying openly.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (finishing off his
dialog: drink)
dialog: Bloody good bloke. One of the best.
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: (blurts out)
dialog: How would you know?
dialog: (She suddenly jumps
text: up and empties her
text: glass in Eddie's
dialog: face.)
dialog: Or you? Or you? None of you knew.
dialog: I knew. He was me dad.
text: She runs off out of the door crying. Keith goes to follow.
text: Carter puts his hand out to restrain him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Let her go. She'll be OK.
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: Sorry about that.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (wiping his face
dialog: with a handkerchief)
dialog: Don't worry. She's bound to be
text: upset.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: Have another?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. I'll be off now. I should be
dialog: at work.
text: Eddie stands up, cap in hand. Carter pulls out a wad of
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Look, look.
text: (He peels off a
dialog: note.)
dialog: Get your suit cleaned.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No. It's all right.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (standing, pushes
dialog: the note in his
dialog: top pocket)
dialog: Thanks for coming.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Frank was a good bloke. It's the
dialog: least I could have done.
text: Eddie leaves.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You work here, Keith?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Yes.
text: Carter thinks for a moment, then leans forward to Keith.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Keith, if anybody comes in here
dialog: and asks for me, you let me know.
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the
dialog: dance hall.
dialog: (He casts an eye
dialog: around the bar.)
dialog: Do you know a man called Albert
dialog: Swift?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Where would I find him?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Today? At the races. He always
dialog: goes.
text: Carter takes out his phial of pills.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: How'd you know Albert?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Went to school with him.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: He was leader of our gang. He'll
dialog: know what's going on in this town.
scene_heading: EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY
text: The rain has just stopped. Bookies and punters lower their
text: umbrellas. Horses thunder towards the finishing post. Turf
text: flies in all directions as the jockeys whip their mounts
text: in a last desperate effort and the crowd roars.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
text: Albert Swift is standing by a bookmaker's marking bis race
text: card with a biro. A hot dog is sticking out of his mouth,
text: like a cigar. A man of about thirty-five, be appears much
text: older, probably from an excess of booze and women. He looks
text: up, and his mouth drops open, the hot dog falling to the
text: ground. He has seen Carter.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
text: Carter is pushing his way along the line of bookies, all
text: the time looking about him. The track loudspeaker announces
text: the winner of the last race.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
text: Albert pales. He holds his race card in front of his face
text: and disappears into the crowd. As he moves off, his foot
text: steps on the hot dog and tomato ketchup oozes out.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACK SADDLING ENCLOSURE - DAY
text: Carter stands alone, casting an eye over the punters. His
text: eyes rest on someone the other side of the saddling ring
text: ERIC PAICE. Dressed in a grey chauffeur's uniform, cap,
text: dark glasses and gloves, he is standing close to three
text: well-heeled-looking men with binoculars and shooting sticks.
text: Horses for the next race are being led around the enclosure.
text: Carter approaches from behind. He looks at Eric closely
dialog: before speaking.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Grey suits you, Eric.
text: Eric swings round, startled.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Good God!
text: Carter smiles.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Is he?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Jack Carter.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Eric. Eric Paice.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What you doing around here then?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Didn't you know this is my home
dialog: town?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No, I didn't know that.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Funny, that.
text: Carter takes out his cigarettes. Eric takes one.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Thanks. So what're you doing? On
dialog: your holidays?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No. I'm visiting relatives.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh, that's nice.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It would be. If they were still
dialog: living.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Meaning what?
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: A bereavement. A death in the
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's all right, Eric.
text: Carter flicks bis lighter and gives Eric a, light.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Very...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So, who you working for these days
dialog: Eric?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh, I'm straight.
dialog: (indicating uniform)
dialog: Respectable.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: What are you doing? Advertising
dialog: Martini?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh, you've been watching television.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
text: Eric smiles back.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Brumby?
text: Eric shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Kinnear?
text: Eric shakes his head
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What's it to you anyway?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I've always ad your welfare at
dialog: heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm
dialog: nosy.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: That's not always a healthy way to
dialog: be...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And you should know, if I remember
dialog: rightly.
text: A track announcement interrupts them.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So you're doing all right then,
dialog: Eric. You're making good.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Making a living.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Good prospects for advancement, is
dialog: there? A pension?
dialog: (He can't resist it
dialog: any longer. He
dialog: lifts the sunglasses
text: off Eric's nose
dialog: and looks into his
dialog: eyes.)
dialog: Do you know, I'd almost forgotten
dialog: what your eyes looked like.
text: Eric stares back.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: They're still the same. Piss holes
text: in the snow.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Still got a sense of humour?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yes, I retained that, Eric.
text: (He moves towards
dialog: the saddling ring
dialog: and turns to Eric.)
dialog: Do you know a man called Albert
dialog: Swift, Eric?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Can't say I do.
text: Carter looks across at the track.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Don't miss the start on my account.
scene_heading: EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY
text: Starting gates slam open and the horses leap out.
scene_heading: INT. HIRE CAR - AFTERNOON
text: Carter is driving along a country road. Ahead, two cars
text: are between him and a Cadillac with dark-tinted windows.
text: The Cadillac turns on to a minor road. Carter follows.
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Eric Paice is driving. In the back sit the three men seen
text: with him at the race track. The drinks compartment is open
text: and they are helping themselves to champagne. Racing results
text: come over the car radio.
scene_heading: INT. HIRE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Carter follows the Cadillac at a safe distance. It turns
text: into a driveway. Carter slows down and reads a sign by the
dialog: entrance: The Heights.
text: He drives on and parks.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Carter comes through a wooded area. He pauses by a lake,
text: now overgrown with weeds. A big man stands tossing stones
text: into the water. Carter silently picks up a dead branch
text: then runs at the man. Carter whacks him on the head and he
text: collapses unconscious into the lake. Carter moves on towards
text: the house. MARTY and RAY the two men previously seen in
text: the Land Rover, are playing with an Alsatian on the spacious
text: lawn fronting the house. It's a Victorian building
text: surrounded by acres of woodland.
text: Carter breaks from the trees and darts for the side door.
text: One of the men notices and shouts after him.
scene_heading: INT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Carter runs into the house and slips into a small service
text: room. Ray and then Marty charge inside but miss seeing
dialog: Carter.
scene_heading: INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A game of poker is in progress. Seated around the table
text: are the three men with Eric at the race track. With them
text: is an elegant man, CYRIL KINNEAR. On the sofa are GLENDA,
text: a sexy-looking young woman, and Eric Paice.
text: Ray bursts in.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Carter's here.
text: Eric jumps up.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You stupid shit!
text: Carter walks past Ray, blowing him a kiss.
text: Kinnear watches with some amusement.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: You see what it's like these days,
dialog: Jack. You can't get the material.
text: Carter looks at Eric.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yes, I can see your problem, Mr
dialog: Kinnear.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Sit down, Jack,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I could weep. I really could.
dialog: Sometimes I think I'll retire.
dialog: Just piss off to the Bahamas and
dialog: let somebody else employ them,
dialog: (to girl)
dialog: Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is
dialog: it, Jack?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (to Glenda)
dialog: Scotch, please.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: (to bouncer)
dialog: Piss off, Ray.
text: Ray closes the door behind him.
text: Glenda brings Carter his Scotch. He looks at her as she
text: sits beside him.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Eric told me of your bereavement.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Do you know, I never knew he worked
dialog: in one of my places!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No? Funny that. Neither did I.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: If I'd known, I'd have fixed him
dialog: up with something better.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Nasty way to go.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yes.
text: One of the three men sitting around the table with Kinnear
text: gets impatient. PETER, LES AND HARRY are well-heeled, middle-
text: aged, northern businessmen.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are we here to play cards or talk
dialog: about the old days?
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Harry! Jack, I don't want to be
dialog: rude, but these men have brought a
dialog: lot of money with them. Glenda,
dialog: you don't offer a man like Jack a
dialog: drink in those piddling little
dialog: glasses. Give him the bloody
dialog: bottle.
dialog: (He picks up his
dialog: cards.)
dialog: Now, where are we?
text: Harry keeps a cold, wary eye on him.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: You're bluffing, you bastard!
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: That's what you pay to find out.
dialog: Right, Jack?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Right. If you can afford it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Carter)
dialog: Thought you were going soon.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Soon. When you've lost your money.
dialog: Won't take long.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Clever sod, aren't you?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Only comparatively.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Harry, I don't like to push, but
dialog: could you let us know how much
dialog: your hand's worth?
text: Harry looks at his cards. Glenda tucks her legs up, making
text: sure that Carter gets an eyeful.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: You know Sid Fletcher?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: You know Sid Fletcher?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I work for him.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Yes, I do.
text: Carter looks back at the table. Kinnear pushes in some
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What's that? A hundred?
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: That's right, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Your hundred, and another hundred.
text: Kinnear lays more cash on the table.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: That, Harry? That's another hundred -
dialog: twenty-five pounds notes of the
dialog: realm.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Three hundred altogether?
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Three hundred altogether, Harry.
text: Glenda attracts Carter's attention again.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: I know him too.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Sid Fletcher.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (sending her up)
dialog: Oh, do you?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: (dumb)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No, do you really?
text: Carter turns to the table yet again.
text: Harry nervously puts another hundred on the table. Kinnear
text: purses his lips.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: I'll follow that and go two hundred.
text: Harry looks sick.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: You can always see me, Harry.
text: Harry sweats and then smiles nervously.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: All right. Two hundred.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: (raises an eyebrow)
dialog: Ha.
text: Kinnear takes a wad of notes out of his pocket. Glenda,
text: shifts herself on the sofa.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Yes. I met him last year.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Oh yes. When he came up on business.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: He came to see Mr Kinnear.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No.
text: Carter, getting bored, looks back at the game.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (panicking)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: That's six hundred pounds, Harry.
dialog: Two hundred to follow you, and
dialog: I've raised it four hundred.
text: Harry sweats some more.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Four hundred?
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're not seeing me?
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: No.
text: Harry smiles nervously. He counts some money out.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'll see you, then.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
text: Harry nods.
text: Glenda speaks, but this time Carter keeps his eyes on the
text: table. Kinnear lays out his hand  a hearts flush, queen
dialog: high.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: We went about together.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Yes, while he was here.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: While he was here. You went about
dialog: together?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: He was here for four days.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Was he?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Could you do me a favour?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Could you please put my glass on
dialog: the table?
text: Carter smiles and does just that.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Oh, come on, Harry. I haven't won,
dialog: have I? Go on, you're pulling my
dialog: leg.
text: Kinnear leans across to pick up Harry's cards. Harry grabs
text: them and puts them in the pack. Kinnear turns to Carter.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: How about that, Jack? Old Harry
dialog: thought I was having him on.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shut up.
text: Carter gets up from the sofa.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Not going, Jack?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I have to. Things to see to.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Of course, of course. Well, any
dialog: time, just drop by.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, I'll do that.
text: (He points at Harry.)
dialog: Told you it wouldn't take long,
dialog: didn't I?
text: Eric opens the door and follows him out.
scene_heading: INT. THE HEIGHTS - HALLWAY - EVENING
text: Carter moves towards the front door.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Jack! I didn't like that.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You should have told me who you
dialog: were working for.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Cyril didn't like it, either.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls
dialog: together, is it?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't
dialog: like it much when they hear you've
dialog: been sticking your nose in.
text: Carter carries on walking to the front door. He opens it.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: He's right. Tell him to save the
dialog: cost of the phone call.
text: Carter leaves. Eric signals Ray to follow him.
scene_heading: EXT. SCRAPYARD - DAY
text: Huge metal claw catches hold of an old car and lifts it
text: like it was a toy. The yard is beside the River Tyne. In
text: the distance a train crosses the Iron Bridge.
text: Carter is examining a beaten-up Hillman when the yard owner,
text: BILLY LAWS, approaches.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What happened to this car?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What's it got to do with you?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: This is my brother's car.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Oh ay?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Well, he drove it into the river.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Was the steering faulty?
text: Billy shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What about the brakes?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How'd it happen, then?
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Was he?
scene_heading: INT. THE HALF MOON - NIGHT
text: A big, busty pub singer is performing on the small stage.
text: A trio on her right plays a good, grinding, up-tempo number.
text: Carter comes through the door. He pushes his way through
text: the packed drunken crowd to the bar. Keith serves him.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: What you having, Jack?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Large Scotch.
text: Carter watches the singer. The customers cheer and whistle.
text: Keith returns with the Scotch. He looks nervously around
text: and speaks to Carter quietly.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Heard of a man called Thorpe?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a
dialog: long time.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: (picking up Carter's
dialog: money)
dialog: That's what he was saying about
dialog: you.
text: Keith takes the money to the till. The music grinds away.
text: Keith returns.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Said he'd heard you were up in
dialog: town. Wondered if I knew where you
dialog: was staying. Wanted to look you
dialog: up. Old time's sake.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's nice. What'd you tell him?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Nowt.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Good lad.
text: Carter watches the singer, then finishes his drink.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: See you later.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Where you off to?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Las Vegas.
text: Carter makes for the door. The singer is now moving through
text: the tables. She pauses to give some man a kiss. Everybody
text: cheers.
text: The woman sitting with the man snaps. She picks up his
text: glass of beer and throws it over the singer; then grabs
text: her hair and pulls her to the ground.
text: Carter stops to watch. The two women roll on the floor,
text: punching and scratching.
text: Carter smiles and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY IN TOWN CENTRE - NIGHT
text: On the corner is a neon-lit snack bar. Doreen and another
text: young girl are sitting inside sucking milk shakes. Somewhere
text: a drunk is singing. His voice echoes up the alley.
text: Carter draws alongside and notices Doreen. He stops and
text: watches her. She hasn't seen him so he goes to the window
text: and knocks on it. She looks up and he beckons her outside.
text: Reluctantly, she comes.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (gently)
dialog: You all right now?
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You coming to South America?
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: No.
text: Carter's hurt and slightly irritated by this rejection.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Where you going to live, then?
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: At me friend's house.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Where's that?
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: Wilton Estate.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Nice family, are they? Church-goers
dialog: and all that?
text: Doreen nods.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't
dialog: suppose I'll see you again.
text: (He pulls out a wad
text: of money, and peels
dialog: off some notes.)
dialog: There. Go and get your hair done.
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: (Can't believe it)
dialog: Thanks.
text: He lifts her chin with his finger and looks at her.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Be good. And don't trust boys.
text: Doreen blushes and turns away. She rushes back to the snack
text: bar with the money to show her friend.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL/SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The front door opens and Carter enters.
text: Standing on the hall table is a small wooden casket with
text: an envelope taped to it. Carter pockets the envelope and
text: picks up the casket.
speaker_heading: EDNA (O.S.)
dialog: That was left for you this evening.
text: Carter walks past her into the sitting room.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: My brother, Frank.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Is he staying the night?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Funny.
dialog: (He puts the casket
text: on a side table.)
dialog: Can I phone London?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: It'll cost you.
scene_heading: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Anna is undressing. She's alone. Pulling the short black-
text: silk underslip over her head, she stands in front of a
text: long mirror, clad only in black panties, bra and tights.
text: She looks at herself appreciatively. The phone rings. She
text: flops on the bed and picks up the receiver.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hello.
text: A voice speaks on the end of the line.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: How I miss you.
dialog: (She stretches
dialog: herself out sexily
dialog: and smiles.)
dialog: Stop it, darling.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: It's a cosy room. Carter is on the telephone. EDNA sits in
text: a rocking chair.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (looking at Edna)
dialog: I fancy you. I wish I was touching
dialog: you right now...
text: Edna turns towards him. Carter fixes her with his eyes.
text: Edna rocks herself gently. Carter continues softly.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: ...making love to you. I want to
dialog: stroke you and kiss you all over.
dialog: Where are you?
scene_heading: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Anna is lying full-length on the bed.
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: In the bedroom.
text: Carter speaks on the other end.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: My black underwear.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Edna rocks backwards and forwards.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: The sexy, silk ones?
text: Anna replies. He continues softly.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Take your bra off.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No, go on.
scene_heading: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Anna unhooks her bra. There's a flash of breasts.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The scene as before.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Now hold them. Gently.
scene_heading: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Anna's hands cover her breasts. Her head moves slowly from
text: side to side, eyes closed.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: Scene as before.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Slowly. Imagine it's me.
scene_heading: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Anna's hand caresses the inside of her leg. Her head rolls
text: from side to side slowly. She's breathing heavily.
text: CROSS-CUT between Edna's head rocking backwards and forwards
text: and Anna's head moving from side to side.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: When we're in South America, we'll
dialog: make love in the sun. Roll over...
dialog: and make love again... and again...
dialog: For me... I fancy you...
text: THE SPEED OF THE CUTTING BUILDS.
scene_heading: INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Suddenly the door opens and Gerald comes in. He sees Anna
text: groaning on the bed.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: What's the matter? You got gut
dialog: trouble or something?
text: Anna sits up abruptly and puts her hand over the receiver.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, darling. Just doing some
dialog: exercises,
dialog: (into telephone)
dialog: Listen, Janet, Gerald's just got
dialog: in, so I must ring off.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yes. Yes. I'll come tomorrow.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: Scene as before.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Save it till Sunday. I'll be back
dialog: then.
text: Carter replaces the receiver. He still holds Edna's eyes.
text: She rocks to and fro. The rocker creaks.
text: The front door bell breaks the mood.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That'll be for me.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT
text: Carter opens the door. Keith is outside. He's sweating.
text: His tie is somewhere round the back of his neck and his
text: suit is covered with dirt.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Thorpey. They were waiting for us
text: in the car park.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: KEITH
text: Four of them.
text: Carter pulls Keith inside and turns out the light.
text: A Ford Zodiac comes along the road. It stops. Four faces
text: peer into the darkness where they're standing. Nobody gets
text: out. The back window winds down. Thorpe's nervous voice
text: floats out.
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: I'd like a word with you, Jack.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's nice.
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: Confidential, like.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You stay in the car. I'll come and
dialog: listen. (
dialog: (He leaves the
dialog: darkness and walks
dialog: to the car.)
dialog: What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
text: Thorpe holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: I've been asked to give you this.
text: He hands Carter a railway ticket. Carter smiles.
speaker_heading: THORPE
text: Train goes at four minutes past
dialog: twelve. You've just got time.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's very kind of somebody. Who
dialog: do I have to thank? (pause) What
dialog: happens if I miss the train?
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: I've been asked to make sure you
dialog: don't.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Oh, really. You're getting very
dialog: optimistic in your old age, aren't
dialog: you, Thorpey?
text: One of the men inside mutters.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Let's stop pissing about.
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: Are you coming, Jack? It'd be best.
text: Carter tears the ticket in half and drops it in the gutter.
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: Right lads.
text: The front passenger door starts to open. Carter grabs it
text: and pulls it wide open. With all his force, he slams it
text: against the man as he gets out. The window shatters over
text: his head. Blood spurts everywhere. The driver panics. He
text: accelerates away as the man in the back is getting out.
text: His foot is trapped in a safety belt. He's upended and
text: dragged along the tarmac, his head dangerously close to
text: the back wheel. His yells make the driver brake. In the
text: confusion Thorpe escapes from the car and makes off. Carter
text: spots him and begins to run.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (roars)
dialog: Thorpe!
text: Thorpe turns into the main road. He makes for the dance
text: hall and disappears inside. Carter follows.
scene_heading: INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT
text: The dance floor is full, mainly with miniskirted girls,
text: their handbags at their feet. A rock band play mechanical
text: music to match the dancing.
text: Thorpe vanishes into the crowd circling the floor. Carter
text: arrives. He scans the place, then sees Thorpe as he
text: disappears down into the gents' lavatory.
scene_heading: INT. DANCE HALL - GENTS' LAVATORY - NIGHT
text: Carter enters. There's no sign of Thorpe. He checks the
text: cubicles until he finds the one that's occupied, then goes
text: into the next one. He climbs on the seat and looks over
text: the partition. Thorpe is sitting down looking at the door.
text: Carter quietly leans across and pulls the chain. Thorpe
text: jumps up, terrified.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Time's up, Thorpey.
text: Carter smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Keith kicks broken glass into the gutter while he waits.
text: Edna's next-door neighbour, an OLD WOMAN, watches. Carter
text: and Thorpe come down the street.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hello, Keith,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Stay there, Thorpey.
text: He knocks on Edna's door. It flies open. Edna is furious.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What the bloody hell do you think
dialog: you're at?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You don't look it.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No. Really, I am.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Don't come that bloody flannel
dialog: with me. If you're a traveller,
dialog: I'm bloody Twiggy.
dialog: (She points at
dialog: Thorpe.)
dialog: And who's he?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: What's going on? Have you no thought
dialog: for others?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: We're going inside.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Inside? Why should I give house-
dialog: room to your sort?
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Up the stairs, Keith. The door on
dialog: the right.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot.
dialog: Everybody knew there'd be trouble
dialog: when you moved in.
text: Carter, Keith and Thorpe enter the house.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You keep your trap shut, Ma.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: I'll send my old man to see you!
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: And wouldn't he love it!
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT
text: Carter, Thorpe and Keith are climbing the stairs. Carter
text: stops to pick up Frank's casket. Edna rushes in and slams
text: the door.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Where do you think you're going?
text: Carter opens the door to his room.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why don't you go and make us all a
dialog: nice cup of tea?
text: Carter shoves Thorpe into the room. Keith follows.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: And what you going to do?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll
dialog: tell you. I might even let you
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: I'll call the police.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (He knows she fancies
dialog: him)
dialog: No, you won't.
text: Carter closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Carter carefully places the casket on the chest of drawers.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Well now, Thorpey. It seems I've
dialog: got a secret benefactor.
dialog: (He moves into the
text: room and opens his
dialog: briefcase, which
dialog: is lying on the
dialog: bed.)
dialog: It's nice to know that. Isn't it,
dialog: Keith?
dialog: (He takes out a
dialog: bottle of whisky.)
dialog: There's only one trouble, I don't
dialog: know who to thank.
text: Thorpe looks longingly at the bottle of Scotch. Suddenly
text: Carter punches him hard in the stomach. He grunts and
text: collapses into a chair.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Now, I want to know who it is,
dialog: Thorpey.
text: Carter tosses the whisky bottle to Keith and continues
text: wearily.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: All right. If you like, Thorpey,
dialog: we'll stop mucking about. Somebody
dialog: doesn't want me poking my nose
dialog: into something and I happen to
dialog: know what that something is.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Now stand up.
text: Thorpe looks at him, terrified. Slowly he stands. Carter
text: grabs him by the testicles and applies preasure. Thorpe
text: screams.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Who paid you to see me off?
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: I can't Jack. How can I?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yes you can.
text: Carter applies more pressure. Thorpe screams.
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: No, don't Jack, don't.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Who sent you, Thorpey?
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Brumby!
text: Carter gives him a final squeeze and lets go. Thorpe groans
text: and slips to the floor, doubled up in agony.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: There you are, you see. Now you
dialog: could, couldn't you?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And quickly.
text: There's a knock on the door. Carter lets in Edna, who is
text: carrying the teatray.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea
dialog: set.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Who's Brumby?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
text: Keith nods.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Ever been into an arcade there and
dialog: put a penny in the slot machine?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff
dialog: Brumby, and like as not the bloody
dialog: arcade as well. Right along the
dialog: coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?
text: Thorpe drags himself painfully to a chair.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Where's he living these days?
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: He's got a new place at Burnham.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Address?
speaker_heading: THORPE
text: On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Suppose you tell me what the bloody
dialog: hell's going on. It's my house,
dialog: you know.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yes, Edna, and I must say you've
dialog: been great about the ...
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Stick the soft soap. Let's be having
dialog: it.
text: Thorpe's plaintive voice interrupts.
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: Can I go now?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You must be joking,
dialog: (to Keith)
dialog: Keep him away from the telephone.
dialog: I'm going out for a bit.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Now just a minute...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Ta-ra.
speaker_heading: THORPE
dialog: Don't let on I told you, for God's
dialog: sake.
text: Carter laughs and closes the door.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT
text: It's a large, new, ranch-style house, set back from the
text: road. The front garden is a landscape gardener's nightmare,
text: with its phoney brick and wrought-iron wishing well,
text: porcelain dwarfs, lily pond, the lot. Fairy lights hang
dialog: over everything.
text: There's a party going on. Lights are on in every room and
text: the rock music is loud. The drive is lined with sports
dialog: cars.
text: Carter parks and gets out.
text: Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily
text: pond. There, he promptly throws up.
text: Carter watches from behind a tree.
text: His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the
text: drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out.
text: CLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably
text: dressed in tuxedo and white scarf. Now he's hopping mad.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Jesus wept!
text: MRS BRUMBY cowers in the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: MRS BRUMBY
dialog: Now, Cliff, don't get mad.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: I'll murder the little bitch!
speaker_heading: MRS BRUMBY
dialog: Cliff ...
text: Brumby roars up to the front door, banging it furiously. A
text: young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a
text: latecomer, is stunned to see who it is.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Daddy!
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: That's right, bloody Daddy.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: I wasn't expecting you until three
dialog: o'clock.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: And this is what you call having a
dialog: few friends back for coffee, is
dialog: it?
text: Brumby pushes past her into the house.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Running bloody riot over my bloody
dialog: furniture, drinking my bloody
dialog: booze...
text: The rest is lost as he disappears inside. He then powers
text: out through the side door
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: ... spewing over my fucking
dialog: goldfish.
text: He aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him
text: face-down into the lily pond.
text: Mrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. As
text: she approaches the house, people pour out. Brumby appears
text: at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers.
speaker_heading: MRS BRUMBY
dialog: Cliff ...
text: Brumby throws the boy out.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Shut up, Phyllis.
text: (He walks back into
dialog: the house.)
dialog: Sandra!
text: Mrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door. Brumby
text: passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a
dialog: bedroom.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Sandra! Unlock the door, you bitch.
text: Carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the
text: row going on upstairs. He opens the door and goes in.
scene_heading: INT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT
text: Carter passes silently through the hall into the large
text: sitting room. Mrs Brumby is sitting in an armchair.
text: Brumby is still yelling at his daughter upstairs.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Good evening.
text: Mrs Brumby jumps. The front door is open.
speaker_heading: MRS BRUMBY
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm an old friend of Cliff's. I
dialog: want to see him.
text: Mrs Brumby looks at her watch irritably.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It's urgent.
speaker_heading: MRS BRUMBY
dialog: What's it about?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Business.
speaker_heading: MRS BRUMBY
dialog: I know all about Cliff's business.
text: Carter moves further into the room.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, well, tell him the Fletchers
dialog: sent me.
text: Mrs Brumby is uncertain what to do. Carter sits in an
text: armchair to make his point. She leaves. A moment later
text: Brumby storms into the room.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: What the bloody hell's all this?
text: Carter doesn't move.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: You know what the bloody time is!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It's two o'clock in the bloody
dialog: morning!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Well?
text: Carter still doesn 't move.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: The wife says the Fletchers sent
dialog: you.
text: Carter just looks at him. Weighing him up.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: What's so bloody important it
dialog: couldn't wait till the morning?
text: Carter starts to laugh. He realizes Thorpe has lied to
text: him. Brumby isn't his man.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Listen, I'm not in the mood for
dialog: bloody silly buggers.
text: Carter stands.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I made a mistake.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I made a mistake.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Never mind.
text: Brumby looks confused.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: It's not business?
text: Carter moves to the door.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: See you.
text: Brumby moves between him and the door.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Listen, I don't like it when some
text: hard nut comes pushing his way in
dialog: and out my house in the middle of
dialog: the night.
text: Carter again makes to leave. Brumby stops him.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Bloody well tell me who sent you.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're a big man, but you're in
dialog: bad shape. With me, it's a full-
dialog: time job. Now behave yourself.
text: Brumby swings at him. Carter moves away from the punch,
text: then applies several sharp blows to Brumby's head and neck.
text: Brumby groans and collapses into the armchair, hurt.
text: Carter walks into the hall and out of the front door.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Good night, Mrs Brumby.
scene_heading: EXT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Carter walks up the deserted street to Edna's place. He
text: finds the front door unlocked.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT
text: Carter enters cautiously. There is no sound. He closes the
text: door quietly and pauses at the foot of the stairs. Still
text: there is no sound. He waits. A sudden rustle attracts his
text: attention. Quietly, he moves to the sitting-room door.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Carter switches on the light. Edna is pressed against the
text: far wall, holding a poker. Her dress is torn and her hair
text: dishevelled. When she sees Carter, she sighs with relief.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You sod.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: They came back?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: No.
text: Carter helps himself to a glass of water from the tap.
text: Edna looks at her torn dress.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Look at this. You bastard.
text: Carter puts the glass on the table.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You don't care a stuff, do you?
text: Carter takes out his phial of pills.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'll buy you another.
text: Carter swallows a pill.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What about the lad? They took him
dialog: away.
text: Carter shrugs his shoulders.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What'll they do to him?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Don't ask me.
text: Edna rubs her wrists.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: They bloody hurt me.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're lucky. They kill as well.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (mocking him)
dialog: And what about you? Did you kill
dialog: Brumby?
text: Carter shakes his head.
speaker_heading: EDNA
text: Thorpey nearly died laughing.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That little shit!
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What about Keith?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What about Keith?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What you going to do?
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Pension him off.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You're a bastard.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (angry)
dialog: What am I supposed to do? I don't
dialog: know where they've taken him. Do
dialog: you?
text: Edna shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So shut up.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What's that gun doing in your room?
dialog: Suppose I phoned the police and
dialog: told them there's a bloke staying
dialog: in my hotel who's planning to shoot
dialog: somebody?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You wouldn't.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: How'd you know I wouldn't?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: 'Cos I know you wear purple
dialog: underwear.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Think about it.
text: Carter takes hold of her torn blouse and rips it open. She
text: is wearing purple underwear.
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
text: It's Sunday morning. A girls' marching band rehearses on
text: the wasteground in front of the terraced houses. The Pelaw
text: Hussars march back and forth carrying their proud banner,
text: led by the drum majorette.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
text: Above the bed hangs a sign 'What would Jesus say?' In the
text: bed lie Carter and Edna. The distant sound of the marching
text: band helps them surface.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Are you awake?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Do you want breakfast?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You must be joking. I never eat
dialog: breakfast,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Did you sleep well?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Uh-huh.
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
text: The Pelaw Hussars keep on marching. The back of their banner
dialog: a stirring motto For Youth and Valour.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
dialog: Scene as before.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Did you sleep well?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yes, thank you.
text: He puts his arm around her and moves on top.
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
text: As the band executes another movement, a red Jaguar slides
text: to a halt outside Edna's house. Two men get out. PETER the
text: Dutchman and CON MCCARTY are definitely not local lads.
text: They look, and are, lethal. They try Edna's front door. It
text: opens.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
dialog: Scene as before.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Are you tired?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: No. Are you tired?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No. I'm not tired,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you eat breakfast?
text: Edna laughs. They start to make love. Gently. Below the
text: undulating bedsprings rests a large chamberpot and, beside
text: it, Carter's shotgun. Beyond is the bedroom door. It opens
text: slowly and the two men enter. Only their legs are visible.
speaker_heading: CON (O.S.)
dialog: Put us in it, Jack.
text: Carter is off the bed, and Edna, in a flash. Edna screams
text: and tries to stop the bedclothes following Carter on to
text: the floor. Peter and Con stand beside the bed smiling.
text: Peter is a queer and dressed fancy in a leather coat, wide-
text: bottomed trousers and a loud silk scarf. His hair is
text: bleached blond. Con is more traditional, more butch. He's
text: in a camelhair overcoat, suit and tie. Both are in their
dialog: thirties.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't let us interrupt you, Jack.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I might have guessed.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Sorry about this. But there you
dialog: are. Orders are orders.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And what orders would they be,
dialog: Con?
text: Carter's hand runs over the carpet. It's going towards the
text: chamber pot instead of the gun.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Gerald phoned us in the middle of
dialog: the night, said he'd heard you've
dialog: been making a nuisance of yourself.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We've got to take you back to
dialog: London.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: He said it'd be doing him a big
dialog: favour.
text: Carter's hand finds the chamber pot and quickly moves on
text: towards the gun.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: We know why you're all steamed up,
dialog: and so do Gerald and Sid.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But they have to be diplomatic.
text: Carter pulls out the gun and jumps up.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Right. Now take me back to London.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: It'd be best if you got dressed
dialog: first.
text: Carter moves around the bed towards them. He's naked.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Put it away, Jack. You know you
dialog: won't use it.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: The gun he means.
text: Both men are laughing.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Out.
text: Peter and Con back down the stairs. Peter looks up at
text: Carter's cock.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: If Anna could see you now.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Out.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Now, Jack. Be reasonable. You know
dialog: we're going to take you back -
dialog: sooner or later.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Out.
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
text: Con is the first to emerge from the front door.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Mind you don't catch cold.
text: Peter follows.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I hope she's got understanding
dialog: neighbours.
text: Then Carter comes out, shotgun held across his chest.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: See you when you've got your drawers
dialog: on.
text: The old woman next door chooses that moment to come out
text: for her milk. As she straightens up, she sees Carter. The
text: bottle flies from her hand and smashes on her doorstep.
text: Carter, never taking his eyes off Peter and Con, slowly
text: backs into the house.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Carter watches from the window as he pulls on his jacket.
text: The gun lies across the armchair. Outside, he can see Peter
text: and Con talking by the Jaguar. Con exits.
text: Edna, now in her dressing gown, enters.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Do us a favour?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What, and get myself beaten up
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No chance of that.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Not much.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: They're friends of mine.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: And that'll make me feel better?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don't want to get rough, do I?
text: Carter picks up the gun. He hands Edna, bis case and the
text: casket.
scene_heading: INT. REAR OF BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
text: Edna comes out of the back gate into an alley, carrying
text: the casket and case. Con emerges from his hiding place
text: holding a handgun.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Hold it! Where do you think you're
dialog: going?
text: Carter appears from the gate next door, covering Con with
dialog: the shotgun.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Strawberry Fair.
text: He takes Con's handgun and signals him to go into Edna's
dialog: yard.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: In. Turn right.
text: (He points the gun
dialog: at the coalshed.)
dialog: Open that door.
text: Con unbolts the door.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And go inside.
text: Con goes in. Carter closes and bolts the door. He moves
text: quickly back to Edna and the car.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What you going to do?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm going to sit in the car and
dialog: whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
text: Carter jumps into the car.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You coming back?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How could I stay away?
text: The car roars off.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY
text: Washing hangs behind each house as far as the eye can see.
text: Carter drives full tilt through it, collecting towels and
text: sheets on the windscreen.
scene_heading: EXT. EDNA'S YARD - DAY
text: The coalhouse door is getting a terrible battering. It
text: finally gives and Con bursts out. He runs into the alley,
text: following after Carter.
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDING HOUSE FRONT - DAY
text: Carter's car screeches as it corners from the alley on to
text: the road. Peter is leaning against the open door of the
text: Jaguar. When he sees Carter coming straight at him, he
text: scarpers for the pavement. Carter hits the Jaguar's door
text: at speed, tearing it off. It flies up and crashes on to
text: the tarmac as Carter careers over the wasteground. Soon he
text: is out of sight.
text: Con comes running. Peter is looking at the damage.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where were you, then?
text: Con sees what's happened to the car and is not pleased.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Bollocks.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK STREET - DAY
text: Carter pulls up outside a house and gets out. He takes the
text: washing off the car's bonnet, and throws it into a neglected
dialog: garden.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY
text: Carter presses the bell. The door's opened by a young man,
speaker_heading: SHAMIR.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Keith in?
speaker_heading: SHAMIR
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Keith.
text: No answer. Shamir watches Carter as he walks into the hall.
speaker_heading: CARTER (O.S.)
dialog: Which is his room?
scene_heading: INT. KEITH'S ROOM - DAY
text: Carter enters and closes the door. Keith is in a had way,
text: his face like a piece of raw steak. He is lying on a bed,
text: still in the clothes of the night before.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What happened to you, then?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: How'd you find me?
text: Keith lifts his head painfully from the pillow.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Did they give you a rough time?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: No.
text: (He lowers his head
dialog: to the pillow.)
dialog: You bastard. You knew they'd come
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No, I didn't,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Does Albert Swift still live over
dialog: the ferry?
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Get knotted.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: All right. All right. I want to
dialog: square things with you first.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Oh yes? How?
text: Carter takes out of his wad of money. Keith's bloodshot
text: eyes watch him through the surrounding puff of flesh.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Stuff it! My girl friend's coming
dialog: from Liverpool tonight. Nice
dialog: surprise, isn't it?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a
dialog: course in karate.
text: He throws some money on the bed. Keith tries to kick it
text: off, but it's too painful. He clutches his testicles.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Frank said you were a shit and he
dialog: was bloody well right.
text: Carter turns to leave. Keith continues, crying and angry.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: You even screwed his wife, didn't
dialog: you?
text: Carter shuts the door, leaving Keith shouting after him.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: The poor bastard didn't even know
dialog: if the kid was his.
text: He falls back on to the bed, crying out in pain.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY
text: A wide road runs alongside the Tyne. It passes below the
text: vast steel bridges that link the two parts of the city. A
text: carpark lies at the foot of the 'Iron Bridge'. Carter pulls
text: up and parks. He gets out and moves quickly.
scene_heading: EXT. THE IRON BRIDGE - DAY
text: The bridge is a, massive structure. The traffic lanes are
text: flanked each side by pedestrian walkways. It is here that
text: Carter and Margaret have arranged to meet.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How were things between you and
dialog: Frank?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: He was all right to me.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Nothing more? Just another feller?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Nicer than most.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: But he was just another feller,
dialog: wasn't he?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Though nicer than most?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes. I can't help the way I am.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (ignoring the
dialog: statement)
dialog: Why'd you see him so regular?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Once a week?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I call that regular.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: He was gentlemanly. I like that.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Once a week you like a gentleman?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Look, I'm me, right. You're not.
dialog: We are what we are, like it or
dialog: not.
text: (She turns and walks
dialog: slowly along the
dialog: bridge.)
dialog: Why all the bloody needle?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What was bugging Frank?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: He wanted me to leave Dave and
dialog: marry him. Last Friday I told him
dialog: it wouldn't work. Dave would have
dialog: killed us both!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He followed me home and kicked up
text: a stink in the street,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I had to tell Frank I couldn't see
dialog: him any more. It was getting too
dialog: dodgy. That was on Sunday.
dialog: (She stops and looks
dialog: over the bridge.)
dialog: He said he'd kill himself. I was
dialog: frightened what you might do.
text: They look at each other for a moment. Carter shakes his
text: head. He gently takes the sunglasses from Margaret's face
text: and folds them up.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don't believe you, Margaret.
dialog: Frank wasn't like that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm the villain in the family,
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It's the truth.
text: Carter snaps her glasses in two and throws them away.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It is. Honestly.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: You bloody whore. Frank was too
dialog: careful to die like that. Who killed
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I don't know nothing.
text: Carter holds her arm. She winces like she's been hit before.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Listen, the only reason I came
dialog: back to this craphole was to find
dialog: out who did it. And I won't leave
dialog: until I do. You understand?
text: Behind Carter Peter's Jaguar comes slowly along the bridge.
text: It stops. The passenger side is a gaping hole.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: Hello, Jack.
text: Carter swings round to see them, then swings angrily back
dialog: to Margaret.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You bitch! It was you who told
dialog: them I was here, wasn't it?
text: He smacks her hard across the face. Margaret cries out.
text: The car draws alongside. A steel mesh separates the
text: pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get
text: to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge. Con leans
text: out, his usual cheery self.
speaker_heading: CON
text: Peter's very upset about his car.
dialog: He's going to shit all over you.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'll catch up with you later,
dialog: Margaret.
text: And with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated
text: roof. Con jumps out of the Jaguar.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (shouts above the
dialog: revs)
dialog: Come on, get in.
text: Con does and they race off.
scene_heading: EXT. WASTELAND - DAY
text: Carter arrives at the top of some narrow, steep, overgrown
text: steps leading down to the river road, where his car is
text: parked. He leaps down the steps as the Jaguar screeches to
text: a halt at the top. Con leaps out of the Jaguar and gives
text: chase. Peter backs the Jaguar and roars off.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER ROAD - DAY
text: Carter comes running down the steps with Con not far behind.
text: He arrives at the river road. In the distance, he can see
text: his parked car.
text: As he nears the car park, Peter's Jaguar comes down the
text: hill. It's going to cut Carter off from his car.
text: A Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there. Its engine roars
text: into life and it races out of the car park. It reaches him
text: just before the Jaguar and slows down.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Over here, Jack.
text: Carter sees that the driver is GLENDA. The hood is down,
text: so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off.
text: The Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming
text: Jaguar, and roars away. Peter hasn't a chance. He's facing
text: the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre.
text: Glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at
text: the top of the hill.
scene_heading: INT. SUNBEAM - DAY
dialog: Every movement Glenda makes is sexually charged manual
text: gear changes, steering, even braking. Carter can't take
text: his eyes off her.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: You didn't know you had a fairy
dialog: godmother, did you?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No. I didn't know that.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: A fairy godmother, all of your
dialog: own. Aren't you lucky?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So where are we going, Princess?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: To the demon king's castle, of
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Of course. Where else?

scene_heading: INT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY
text: Glenda really puts her foot down. The car hurtles around
text: each deserted floor.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How'd you know where I'd be?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: You were seen parking your car.
text: The demon king waves his wand and
dialog: I was dispatched to bring you to
dialog: him. Lucky for you I waited.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Very lucky, I should think. You're
dialog: drunk!
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Nasty.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: He must have been pretty sure I'd
dialog: come.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Oh, he was. He told me a magic
dialog: spell that would make you come.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: And what was that?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: We're there now.
text: She brakes to a split-second stop.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE RESTAURANT - DAY
text: It's one large empty concrete box with big picture windows
text: all the way round. Wires are hanging from the ceiling and
text: walls where the lights will eventually be fixed.
text: A tall figure stands at the opposite end, facing the setting
text: sun. He is just a silhouette.
text: Carter and Glenda enter and walk towards the man. The
text: silhouette turns as he nears it. It's Brumby.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: A new venture of mine. It's going
dialog: to be a restaurant.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you like it?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Last night, after you'd gone, I
dialog: did a little bit of asking around.
dialog: Seeing as you weren't very
dialog: forthcoming,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It seems that you are concerned
dialog: about the death of your brother?
dialog: (pause) I got to thinking it would
dialog: be nice if the bloke you were after
dialog: was the same bloke I wanted off my
dialog: back,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You know my life. Machines. The
dialog: arcades. Nice business. Looks after
dialog: itself. People put money in. I
dialog: take it out. Not much rough stuff.
dialog: It's a business that makes me very
dialog: happy. But recently, I've had a
dialog: spot of bother,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: One of my lads gets a bit over-
text: anxious and flogs some machines in
dialog: a club that's already got some.
dialog: The upshot is I've had to eat shit
dialog: and stop flogging my machines to
dialog: other clubs.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So far as I'm concerned, that's
dialog: it. Apparently not. These people
dialog: I've offended get the idea that it
dialog: would be good to take over my whole
dialog: outfit,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So I'm worried. I can't fight them
dialog:  I haven't that kind of set-up.
dialog: But I've got to fix them before
dialog: they fix me. Trouble is, if I try
dialog: and they find out, I'm dead.
text: Brumby picks up a black briefcase. He holds it up to Carter.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Five grand. It belongs to you.
dialog: Along with a little name I'm going
dialog: to give you.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What name?
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Kinnear did it.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: I don't know. All I know is that
text: people were shitting bricks up at
dialog: his place last Saturday. Your
dialog: brother's name was mentioned. Next
dialog: day, he was dead.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: I don't know. That's all I was
dialog: told.
text: Carter takes a last look at Glenda and walks slowly back
text: towards the entrance.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's not good enough.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Christ, what...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Do me a favour. You don't really
dialog: expect me to fix Kinnear on your
dialog: say-so?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Just because they tried to get me
dialog: on you last night, don't think you
dialog: can pull the same trick. Stroll
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Jack, you're wrong.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter
dialog: exits.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Jack...
scene_heading: EXT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY
text: Carter steps out of the elevator as Glenda's Sunbeam comes
text: down the bottom ramp fast. The car brakes hard and stops.
text: Carter opens the door and gets in. Not a word is said.
scene_heading: INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The apartment is one of many in a modern block and Glenda
text: has only recently moved in. There is a mattress on the
text: floor. A large mirror leans against the wall behind it and
text: a film projector stands close to the window, which has
text: makeshift curtains.
text: Carter and Glenda are on the mattress. The bedding is all
text: over the place. They have just finished fucking.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Who's setting you up in this place?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Brumby.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Is he coming here?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Don't worry. He's meeting the
text: architects at the restaurant.
text: Carter plays with her hair.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Aren't you scared Kinnear will
dialog: find out?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
text: Carter kisses her neck.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What does he want that bloody great
dialog: country place for?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: (knowingly)
text: Entertaining.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What kind of entertaining?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Now you're asking.
text: Carter looks at the film projector by the bed and points.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Does Brumby get a kick out of that
dialog: crap?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: Especially when I play the lead.
text: Carter wraps his arms about her.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Did Kinnear say anything? After
dialog: I'd left the other night?
text: Glenda sits up sharply.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: That's why you waited for me.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (kissing her on the
dialog: neck)
dialog: Not entirely. No.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: You sure about that?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sure I'm sure.
text: Glenda pushes him away and gets out of the bed.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: You bastard.
text: Glenda leaves for the bathroom. Carter, curious, looks at
text: the film projector. It's loaded. He switches it on. A beam
text: of light hits the opposite wall. He settles down to watch
text: the film. The leader flashes by, then a title being chalked
text: on a school blackboard 'The Teacher's Pet'. A zoom back
text: reveals Glenda, bare-breasted, holding the chalk. This is
text: followed by a long shot of a young girl, dressed in school
text: uniform, waiting at a bus stop. A car approaches and stops.
text: A woman driver offers the girl a lift. The woman is
text: Margaret. The identity of the girl not revealed.
scene_heading: INT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Glenda is in the bath. Lots of foam. The hot water is still
text: running. She's smoking. She leans forward, turning off
dialog: the tap.
scene_heading: INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Carter is sitting up on the mattress, amused by the soft
text: porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him.
text: The schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off.
text: The door to an anonymous apartment opens and Margaret comes
text: in with the girl. Her school hat still hides her identity.
text: Glenda is there to greet them.
text: The girl is very awkward. Glenda tries to make her relax,
text: sitting her down and showing her a magazine.
text: Glenda brings her into a bedroom. She takes her own top
text: off and goes to do the same with the girl. She takes her
text: hat off. A close-up shows that it is Doreen.
text: Carter tenses but never flinches from what's happening in
text: the film. Margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock
text: at what she sees. She slaps Glenda and they start fighting,
text: eventually rolling off the bed.
text: The apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar
text: comes in.
text: Carter sits up. It's Albert Swift.
text: Albert opens another door, looking for someone. He leaves.
text: Another door opens and he's in the bedroom. He sees the
text: two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his
text: prize Doreen. Carter watches.
text: Doreen bites her nails and looks terrified. Reflected in
text: the mirror behind Carter is the image of Albert taking off
text: his trousers. The reel runs out and flaps like a fish.
text: Carter doesn't move. Tears form in his eyes. He looks old
text: and defeated. His is a wasted life. Then the anger that
text: drives him explodes again and he throws back the bedclothes.
scene_heading: INT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Carter, now dressed, moves slowly towards her in the bath.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I want to give you an Oscar.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You've been watching the film.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Tell me about the girl.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: What girl?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: The young girl. Who pulled her?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Was it Albert?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Shouldn't think so.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Is it one of Kinnear's films?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Who set it up? Eric?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Then he must have pulled her.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Expect so.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Did my brother Frank find out?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: Your brother? What you talking
dialog: about?
text: Carter's fury bursts. He's out of control. He seizes Glenda
text: and plunges her under the bathwater, holding her there.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're a lying bitch.
text: Carter lifts her up, out of the water. She is spluttering,
dialog: nearly drowned.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Now tell me the truth.
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: The girl's name was Doreen. That's
dialog: all I know.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And you didn't know her last name?
speaker_heading: GLENDA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Well, it's Carter. That's my name,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And her father was my brother. And
dialog: he was murdered last Sunday. Now
dialog: get up and get dressed.
text: He pushes her ahead of him.
scene_heading: EXT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY
text: Carter manhandles Glenda towards her Sunbeam. He opens the
dialog: boot.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Get in.
text: Glenda climbs in and he slams the boot shut. The car
text: scorches away.
scene_heading: EXT. JETTY. TYNE FERRY - DAY
text: Carter parks the sports car as the ferry docks. He moves
text: down the gangway towards it.
scene_heading: INT. CAFE - DAY
text: A girl with a baby in a pram is having a cup of tea. The
text: door slams open. There's Carter.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Where's Albert?
text: The girl is numb with fear, unable to answer. Carter grabs
text: her by the throat.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Where's Albert?
text: The girl is frozen with terror. He lets go as suddenly as
text: he grabbed her.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I know where I'll find him.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK STREET - DAY
text: Carter walks fast. There's the sound of a phone being
text: dialled. It's the GIRL in the cafe.
speaker_heading: GIRL (V.O.)
dialog: Eric, he's come for Albert,
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I don't know, (pause) On the ferry,
dialog: I reckon.
text: Carter reaches the front of a betting shop. He walks in.
scene_heading: INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY
text: Carter closes the door. Race results and odds are coming
text: over the Tannoy. He moves into the shop until he reaches
text: ALBERT SWIFT. Albert is making out a betting slip and
text: doesn't see him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hello, Albert.
text: Albert looks like he's going to be sick.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Hello, Jack,
dialog: (snivelling)
dialog: I don't know anything, Jack.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll
dialog: kill you.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I know. I know.
text: Carter sees a door at the back. There's a sign for the
dialog: toilets.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Do you want to go to the toilet,
dialog: Albert?
text: At first Albert doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Do you want to go to the toilet,
dialog: Albert?
text: This time it clicks. Albert moves to the door and Carter
text: follows.
scene_heading: EXT. BETTING SHOP BACKYARD - DAY
text: Carter turns to close the door. Albert runs for it. He
text: reaches the high double-gate at the end. It's locked and
text: he tries to climb it. No luck. Carter easily pulls him
text: down. Albert faces him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You can't get away from me, Albert.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I know.
text: He feels for his cigarettes but can't find them.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: For Christ's sake, give us a fag.
text: Carter takes out his cigarettes. Albert takes one.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I didn't know who Doreen was.
dialog: Thought she was just another bird.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Did Eric Pake pull her?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I dunno. He's got his ways. He
dialog: knows Margaret.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: When did you find out?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: A couple of weeks back.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: No choice. I had a visit from
dialog: somebody.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
text: Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film.
dialog: He wanted to meet Doreen.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And you told Brumby?
text: Albert nods.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Who killed Frank?
text: Albert doesn 't answer.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Do you want to be dead, Albert?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and
text: two of his boys arrive with Frank
dialog: and tell me that he's rumbled.
text: Somehow, he's seen the film and
text: was about to shoot his mouth off.
dialog: They ask me for some whisky and
text: start forcing it down his throat.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I thought they'd just duff him up
dialog: a bit. Honest.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What did you do? Albert?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Nothing. What could I do?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Did Eric know that Frank was my
dialog: brother?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Yes. I told him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: 'Good.'
text: Albert draws deeply on his cigarette.
text: They drove Frank away in a car.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Is that all there is?
text: Albert nods.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Then that's it, Albert.
text: Carter takes something from his pocket. There's a loud
dialog: click. It's a. knife.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Jack, for Christ's sake ...
text: He falls to his knees.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You knew what I'd do.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't
dialog: kill him.
text: Carter drives the knife into him with all his might.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I know you didn't kill him.
dialog: (and again.)
dialog: I know you didn't.
text: A ship's horn calls mournfully from the harbour. Albert
text: leans back. Blood seeps from his chest. He pitches forward,
text: twitches, and is dead.
scene_heading: INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY
text: Carter comes in from the back and walks calmly through to
text: the street. A blind man is at the counter placing a bet.
scene_heading: EXT. JETTY - TYNE FERRY - DAY
text: The Sunbeam waits in the car park. Eric, Con and Peter
text: arrive in the Land Rover and park behind it. They go down
text: the gangplank to the floating jetty. A ferry is chugging
text: across the water.
scene_heading: INT. FERRY - DAY
text: Carter sits, watching the other passengers. A mother and
text: two young children take his attention. His look is tinted
text: with regret even remorse.
scene_heading: EXT. JETTY - DAY
text: As the ferry comes alongside, Eric, Con and Peter move up
text: to the rail. The passengers disembark, leaving Carter
text: standing alone. He's holding Con's handgun.
text: Eric, Con and Peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters.
text: Peter, impatient as ever, pulls a sawn-off automatic shooter
text: from under his coat, cocks it and fires. Too late. Carter
text: is already safely behind the ferry's superstructure. Eric
text: shouts.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No shooters. Cyril said no shooters,
dialog: you stupid bastard.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: Get stuffed. He's reloading.
speaker_heading: CON
text: Gerald wants to see him first.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Shut up.
text: Carter is listening to all this.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Are you coming in? Or do we piss
dialog: about all day?
text: Eric laughs.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You're finished, Jack. You know
dialog: that, don't you? I've bloody
dialog: finished you.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Not till I'm dead, Eric.
text: Eric laughs.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh, you've still got your sense of
dialog: humour? Tell him how I've fixed
dialog: him, Con.
speaker_heading: CON
dialog: He's told Gerald about you and
dialog: Anna.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Didn't believe us at first, did
dialog: he, Con? Then Peter talked to him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Didn't even say goodbye. Just asked
dialog: us to take you back - alive.
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: He's probably talking to her right
dialog: now. Are you still going to fancy
dialog: her when Gerald's finished with
dialog: her face?
text: Carter shows no emotion. Or are his eyes just that bit
text: sadder? Peter lets rip again. Another window is shattered.
text: Carter ducks back, allowing Peter time to board the ferry.
text: Carter catches a glimpse of Peter as he climbs up the
text: ferry's superstructure to the roof. By the time he heaves
text: himself into position, Carter is waiting.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Stay where you are, Peter.
text: Peter is helpless, clinging to the roof, unable to even
text: raise his shooter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Don't.
text: There's a long pause while Carter looks at him, then he
text: cold-bloodedly shoots. Peter is blown away. By the time he
text: hits the deck, he's dead.
text: Con and Eric panic. They run up the gangplank, safely out
dialog: of range.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Carter, your car needs a wash.
text: Eric signals to the driver in the Land Rover to bump the
text: Sunbeam into the water. Two hits and the task is done.
text: Glenda's screams are lost as the river wraps itself around
text: the sinking car.
text: Carter watches impassively.
scene_heading: EXT. BRUMBY'S RESTAURANT COMPLEX - DAY
text: Carter's hire car corners at speed into the high-rise

scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Brumby and two architects in a site meeting. Plans are

speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: I don't want them cooking in here.
dialog: You can put a hatch in that wall.
scene_heading: INTERIOR DECORATOR
dialog: Yes, it's all a question of ...
text: The sound of a car screeching up the ramps interrupts him.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Who in Christ's name is that? It's
text: a bloody madman.
text: He strides away to investigate.
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Brumby comes out to the top tier. On the floor below,
text: Carter, unseen by Brumby, has parked and is now making for
text: the concrete spiral staircase.
scene_heading: EXT. STAIRCASE - DAY
text: Brumby pounds down to the first level. Carter comes around
dialog: the corner.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: Jack!
text: Carter slams his fist hard into his gut.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You shouldn't have shown the film
dialog: to Frank.
speaker_heading: BRUMBY
dialog: I had to. It was the only way I
dialog: could get at them.
scene_heading: INT. BACK STREET POST OFFICE - EVENING.
text: It's a combined shop and post office. Carter is on the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: The guy on the swing-bridge?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: OK.
text: Carter hangs up. He takes a can of film from his pocket
text: and slips it into a large envelope. At the counter two
text: women are talking.
speaker_heading: FIRST WOMAN
dialog: They don't know how it happened.
speaker_heading: SECOND WOMAN
dialog: How far did he fall?
speaker_heading: FIRST WOMAN
dialog: What did Betty say... Ninety floors,
dialog: I think it was.
speaker_heading: SECOND WOMAN
dialog: Really. Was he dead?
speaker_heading: FIRST WOMAN
dialog: Oh, yes.
text: The envelope is passed across to the post office assistant.
text: It is addressed to Vice Squad, Scotland Yard, London Sw1.
speaker_heading: SECOND WOMAN
dialog: Better to go quick like that.
scene_heading: EXT. SWING-BRIDGE - EVENING
text: The huge steel superstructure pivots on a large man-made
text: island in the middle of the river.
text: On top is a structure not unlike a small lighthouse, from
text: which a man operates the bridge. Carter climbs the outside
text: ladder. A man waits for him at the top.
text: The man hands him a small cloth package. Carter opens it.
text: Inside is heroin and a hypodermic. He wraps it up again
text: and hands over an envelope. The man checks the money as
text: Carter disappears down the outside ladder.
scene_heading: INT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT
text: The hall is crowded. The compere calls the numbers. The
text: atmosphere is tense as the audience look at their cards.
text: Someone calls, 'Bingo.' A buzz goes round the hall as
text: everybody starts talking again.
text: Carter enters, surveying the audience. Eventually, his

text: She's involved with a woman friend and doesn't see him.
text: The next game starts up.
scene_heading: EXT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT
text: Crowds of people come pouring out. It's the end of the

text: Carter follows them and turns up a side street.
scene_heading: EXT. STEPS LEADING TO BACK STREET - NIGHT
text: The place is deserted. Margaret and her friend descend the

text: Carter follows discreetly. At the bottom, Margaret and her
text: friend chat for a moment and part.
text: Carter follows Margaret.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT
text: The clop of Margaret's shoes is heard in the distance. She

text: dark alley to get ahead of her. As she reaches her home
text: Carter's arm shoots out from behind a pillar. It's holding
text: Con's handgun.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I've come for you, Margaret.
scene_heading: INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: There's a big party going on. The music is loud. It's mainly
text: rich-looking middle-aged men and young dolly birds.
text: Different things are obviously going on in different rooms
text: in the house. Dancing in one room, blue movies in another,
text: etc. Kinnear flits from one to another. Eric Paice is on
text: the phone. He puts the receiver down and crosses to Kinnear.
speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It's Carter. Listen carefully, you
dialog: hairy-faced git. I've got the film
dialog: and enough evidence to put you
text: away for a long time. All it takes
text: is one call to the police.
scene_heading: INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kinnear listens.
speaker_heading: KINNEAR
dialog: Really?

dialog: So?
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT

text: Kinnear continues listening.
scene_heading: INT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT
text: Carter into phone.
speaker_heading: CARTER

scene_heading: EXT. WOOD - NIGHT
text: Carter and Margaret stop.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Take your clothes off.

text: knickers.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Keep your pants on.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Lie down.
text: Again she obeys.
text: He kneels on her, pinning her arms with his knees, then
text: stuffs a gag in her mouth.
text: He takes out the hypodermic, places it against her arm,
text: and injects the heroin into her. She struggles, her eyes
text: moving frantically about. She screams, but its muffled by
text: the gag. Carter holds her down and she quickly goes under.
text: Carter removes the gag. He stands, picks her up and walks
text: into the darkness with Margaret in his arms.
scene_heading: INT. THE HEIGHTS - LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: Kinnear is alone, speaking on the telephone quietly. The

text: A bedside light is on. A man in bed is listening on the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yes.
text: He taps his cigarette against the ashtray. On his middle
text: finger is a large ring with the initial 'J' on it. He
text: listens until the line goes dead.
text: The woman beside him stirs. He stubs out the cigarette and
text: switches off the light. Darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
text: Eric comes out of the front door. Inside the party is still
text: in progress. He gets into a Cadillac and drives off.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAWN
text: Carter is parked where he can see the drive up to Kinnear's
dialog: house.
text: The Cadillac appears and swings on to the road.
text: There's the sound of a phone being dialled.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Police.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
text: A long line of police cars move slowly up the drive,
text: followed by a police bus. They park by the front door and
text: around fifty policemen pour out. They move silently around
text: the building. A chief constable opens the front door and
text: walks in.
scene_heading: INT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
text: The police move through the house and grounds. In the
text: bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together. The
text: men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about
text: being identified. The police find evidence of drugs,
dialog: pornography and so on.
text: Outside, police are combing the grounds. In the long grass
text: leading down to the lake they find women's clothes. They
text: follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked,
text: face downwards, in the lake. A policeman with waders goes
text: in and pulls her to the side. As others heave her out, we
dialog: see that it's Margaret.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
text: The house is surrounded by police measuring and
text: photographing, and outside the house are police cars and
text: ambulances. The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In
text: the early-morning light, they look like dolls.
text: Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes
text: officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes
text: down the short drive to the gate.
scene_heading: INT. HIRE CAR - DAWN
text: Carter is driving along a coast road. The sea and a wide
text: beach lie on his right. Long rows of houses are to his
dialog: left.
text: The sun is still low. It's very quiet. He arrives at a
text: harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast
text: wooden jetty running out into the estuary. It's a coal
dialog: loader for tankers.
text: This jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and
text: pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways. On its top
text: tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal
dialog: chutes.
scene_heading: EXT. COAL JETTY - DAWN
text: Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle
text: of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to
text: the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man
text: is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly.
text: He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway.
text: Carter follows.
text: At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only
text: the harbour waters lapping below.
text: Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see
text: Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the
text: roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly
text: above him.
text: Eric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's
text: playing cat and mouse with Eric.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: You couldn't win an egg and spoon
dialog: race, Eric.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (wheezing)
dialog: Sod off.
text: Paice darts down another staircase to ground level and
text: makes for the roadway. Carter stops above the roadway.
text: Below, Paice makes for the parked car. Carter holds the
text: gun up. Eric stops and looks up.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Stay away from the car or I'll
dialog: blow you apart.
text: Eric darts under the jetty. Carter runs on down the steps.
text: He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards
text: the beach. Carter starts after him.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
text: Eric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his
text: feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting.
text: In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke. Carter
text: appears. For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at
text: the far end of the beach. He climbs down to the beach and
text: starts running.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
text: Carter is gaining on Eric rapidly. Eric looks round and
text: panics. He stumbles and falls over.
text: He gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the
text: headland. Carter follows.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
text: On the other side of the headland, the scene is
text: extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the
text: world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's
text: littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep
text: in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the
text: left. It's deserted.
text: In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets
text: move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit
text: their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal
text: mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The
text: sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore.
text: Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud.
text: Carter closes on him.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
text: Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the
text: mine. Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and
text: crash as they move along the cable.
text: Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal
text: slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on
text: his heels. Near the top, where the buckets are practically
text: at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too
text: exhausted to get up.
text: Carter stands over him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (panting slightly)
dialog: Stand up, Eric. Stand up.
text: Eric just manages it. Carter pulls the bottle of Scotch
text: out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I bet you could use a drink, could
dialog: you, Eric?
text: He throws the bottle to Eric.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Eh? Have a drink.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Still got your sense of humour.
text: Eric takes the cap off and looks at Carter. He's in a
dialog: terrible state.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Drink up, Eric. Drink up. I want
dialog: you to drink all of that. Do you
dialog: understand? Drink up. Just like it
dialog: was with my brother, Frank. Go on,
dialog: son. Drink up.
text: Eric pours the whisky into his month. It spills over and
text: runs down his face.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Drink up, Eric.
text: Eric begins to stagger about.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It was you who poured it down him.
dialog: Eh, Eric?
text: Eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at Carter. No
dialog: mercy there.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Did you all have a good laugh, eh?
dialog: Did you have a good laugh when he
dialog: was spewing it up? The whisky is
text: pouring all over Eric's face and
dialog: suit.
text: It's disgusting to watch. Suddenly, he retches, but nothing
text: comes up.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Drink it! Drink it! Did you all
dialog: pass the bottle round after the
dialog: car went over the top?
text: Eric is choking.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Don't stop, Eric.
text: Carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle
text: up to Eric's mouth again. In the other, he holds the
text: shotgun. Eric chokes and retches. Carter has seen enough.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Goodbye, Eric.
text: Carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on
text: Eric's head.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
text: Eric's body, loaded on to a a coal bucket, moves off on
text: it's final journey. Carter, laughing, walks beside it, gun
text: riding on his shoulder. The bucket shudders and grinds as
text: it moves along the cable. Eric's body moves of on its final
text: journey. It reaches the end of the line, where an automatic
text: catch tilts it. Eric's body drops into the sea. The coal
text: slag follows in a cloud of black dust. The waves pass over
text: and everything is gone.
text: Carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the
text: beach. He stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get
dialog: rid of it.
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING
text: Below, Carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea. He raises
text: the shotgun to throw it away. High on the clifftop a rifle
text: and telescopic lens line up on Carter. A finger curls around
text: the trigger. On the middle finger of the same hand is a
text: large gold ring with the letter 'J' engraved upon it. It
text: is the man Kinnear contacted after sending Eric to his
dialog: death.
text: The finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it. There's a
text: quiet, whooshing sound. Carter drops to the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - EARLY MORNING
text: Carter lies on the beach. The waves lap around his head. A
text: small trickle of blood pours out of a hole in his temple.
text: He's dead.
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING
text: Kinnear's hit man coolly dismantles his rifle. He carefully
text: wraps it in a cloth fishing-rod carrier. He walks off and
text: is soon lost as he drops out of sight.
