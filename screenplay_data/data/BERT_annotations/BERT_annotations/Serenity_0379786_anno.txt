scene_heading: EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY
text: It's a group of twelve-year-olds, serious and well dressed.
text: They sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent, small
text: wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them. The
text: tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage. People walk
text: about and vehicles glide quietly overhead. A utopian vista.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Now that the war's over, our
dialog: soldiers get to come home, yes?
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Some of them. Some will be
text: stationed on the rim planets as
dialog: Peace Enforcers.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: I don't understand. Why were the
dialog: Independents even fighting us?
dialog: Why wouldn't they look to be more
dialog: civilized?
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: That's a good question. Does
dialog: anybody want to open on that?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I hear they're cannibals.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER BOY
dialog: That's only Reavers.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER GIRL
dialog: Reavers aren't real.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER BOY
dialog: Full well they are. They attack
dialog: settlers from space, they kill
dialog: them and wear their skins and rape
dialog: them for hours and hours --
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: (in Chinese)

speaker_heading: (CALMER)
dialog: It's true that there are...
dialog: dangers on the outer planets. So
dialog: let's follow up on Borodin's
dialog: question. With all the social and
dialog: medical advancements we can bring
dialog: to the Independents, why would
dialog: they fight so hard against us?

speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: We meddle.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: River?
text: RIVER is a dark, intense little girl, writing with one hand
text: and "typing" with the other. (Typing consists of holding a
text: long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different
text: columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen.) She is
text: a good two years younger than the other kids.
speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: People don't like to be meddled
dialog: with. We tell them what to do,
dialog: what to think, don't run don't
dialog: walk we're in their homes and in
dialog: their heads and we haven't the
dialog: right. We're meddlesome.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: (gently taking her
speaker_heading: STYLUS)
dialog: River, we're not telling people
dialog: what to think. We're just trying
dialog: to show them how.
text: She violently PLUNGES the stylus into the girl's forehead
scene_heading: INT. LAB - NIGHT
text: And we FLASH CUT to the actual present: a 16 year old RIVER
text: sitting in a metal chair, needles stuck in her skull (one
text: right where the teacher had stuck her) being adjusted by a
text: technician. A second monitors her brain patterns.
text: The lab is cold, blue, steel. Insidiously clean.
speaker_heading: 2ND TECHNICIAN
text: She's dreaming.
speaker_heading: FIRST TECHNICIAN
dialog: Nightmare?
speaker_heading: 2ND TECHNICIAN
text: Off the charts. Scary monsters.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: Let's amp it up. Delcium, eight-
dialog: drop.
text: DOCTOR MATHIAS is not instantly likable -- nor gradually, for
text: that matter. A cold man, and more than a little satisfied
dialog: with himself.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
text: Behind him stands a GOVERNMENT INSPECTOR, observing. And
text: making him a little nervous.
text: The Inspector is in shadow, but his uniform indicates
dialog: -- no
text: substantial rank, as does the eagle-crested baton
text: longer than a ruler -- that he clutches in one gloved hand.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: See, most of our best work is done
dialog: when they're asleep. We can
dialog: monitor and direct their
text: subconscious, implant
dialog: suggestions...
text: River starts convulsing, mewing in misery. The Inspector
text: starts forward, slowly.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: It's a little startling to see,
text: but the results are spectacular.
dialog: Especially in this case. River
dialog: Tam is our star pupil.
text: The Inspector steps into the light. He is rigid, cold,
text: staring at the girl with no emotion at all. His name, as we
dialog: will very soon learn, is SIMON.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: I've heard that.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: She's a genius. Her mental
dialog: capacity is extraordinary, even
dialog: with the side-effects.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Tell me about them.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: Well, obviously, she's unstable...
dialog: the neural stripping gives them
dialog: heightened cognitive reception,
dialog: but it also destabilizes their own
text: reality matrix. It manifests as
dialog: borderline schizophrenia... which
dialog: at this point is the price for
dialog: being truly psychic.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (moves toward her)
dialog: What use do we have for a psychic
dialog: if she's insane?
speaker_heading: J
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: I don't have to tell you the
dialog: security potential of someone who
dialog: can read minds. And she has lucid
dialog: periods -- we hope to improve upon
dialog: the... I'm sorry, Sir, I have to
dialog: ask if there's some reason for
dialog: this inspection.
speaker_heading: SIMON
speaker_heading: (TURNING)
dialog: Am I making you nervous?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: Key members of Parliament have
dialog: personally observed this subject.
dialog: I was told their support for the
dialog: project was unanimous. The
dialog: demonstration of her power --
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (turns back to her)
dialog: How is she physically?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: Like nothing we've seen. All our
dialog: subjects are conditioned for
dialog: combat, but River... she's a
dialog: creature of extraordinary grace.
dialog: 400
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Yes. She always did love to dance.
text: He drops to one knee, slamming his baton to the floor.
scene_heading: ANGLE: THE BATON
text: As the top pops off like a bouncing betty (the grenade),
text: flying up over Simon and River's heads and then bursting
text: forth in a flat circle of blue energy that bisects the room,
text: flowing through the staff's heads and knocking them out.
text: Simon rushes to River, gently removes the probes from her
text: head and swabs her, whispering:
speaker_heading: SIMON
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: River. Wake up. Please, it's
dialog: Simon. River. It's your brother.
dialog: Wake up...
text: She begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door, looking
text: out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderly's tunic
dialog: beneath.

dialog: 
dialog:

text: River is suddenly next to him. He jumps a little.
speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: Simon.
text: A beat, as they face each other, Simon fighting emotion.
speaker_heading: RIVER
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: They know you've come.
scene_heading: INT. GUARD STATION - CONTINUING
text: As a guard looks at a monitor. He mostly resembles a secret
text: service man -- more bureaucrat than thug. A second man rolls
text: into frame on a chair behind him, also watching the screen.
scene_heading: INT. RESEARCH CENTER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING
text: Simon walks River through the corridor. They approach a pair
text: of double doors.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: We can't make it to the surface
text: from inside.
text: Simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps, people heading at
text: them from the other side of the doors.
speaker_heading: 4wo SIMON
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Find a --
text: But River has, impossibly, scampered up over some lab
text: equipment to the dark top of the corridor, where she holds
text: herself in a perfect split, feet against the walls and
text: outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support.
text: The doors burst open and two doctors pass by, hardly noticing
text: the lone orderly. Passing right under River.
scene_heading: EXT. VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER
text: It's small, 15 feet by 15 feet. Goes a long way up and a
text: long way down. One wide hinged window looks in on the hall
text: inside. Simon and River approach with quiet haste.
text: They slip through the window. Simon shuts it, wedges his
text: baton into the handle as the SECURITY AGENTS APPROACH. They
text: fire at the glass, but their lasers have no effect.
text: Wind whips River's hair about as she looks up to see a small
text: patch of daylight visible ten stories up. Sees the sky
text: blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them.
speaker_heading: V0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
text: ANGLE: THE SHIP is floating over the grass of rolling hills,
text: the city gleaming far beyond. This facility is well hidden.
text: A gurney-sized section of the ship's belly detaches and drops
text: down ten stories, cables spooling it out of the ship. It
text: comes to Simon and River and stops suddenly.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Get on!
text: He is standing by the window -- and the Security Agent is
text: right behind him, PUNCHING the window with all his might.
text: Simon helps River onto the gurney, then jumps on himself as
text: the Security Agent cracks the glass. The two are whisked up
text: in the gurney, River on her knees, Simon standing beside her
dialog: holding one of the cables --
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE (O.S.)
dialog: Stop.
text: The action freezes.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE (0.S.)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Lovely. Lovely. Backtrack.
text: The action REVERSES, taking us back to the moment of Simon
text: and River on the gurney just before it rises.
dialog: f t o
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Stop.
text: There is a motionless beat, River frozen in that crouch, and
text: he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event.
dialog: The Government's man. We'll just call him THE OPERATIVE.
text: He is thoughtful, a little removed. Wire-rimmed glasses, a
text: suit too nondescript to be a uniform, too neat to be casual
dialog: wear. He is in:
scene_heading: INT. INSTITUTE RECORDS ROOM - DAY
text: -- which is long and bare but for drawers of holographic
text: records, a set-up for watching recordings (where the image of
text: Simon and River floats), and a table with computer and chair.
text: The Operative crosses to the table, looks over some papers.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: Biograph. Simon Tam.

text: As Simon's history files down in print and pictures --
dialog: graduation, security photo from his medical internship --
text: over one lens of the Operative's glasses.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Remarkable children.
text: Doctor Mathias storms in, two security men (not the ones from
text: the opening) and a nervous young female intern following.
text: Mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: Excuse me! No one is allowed in
dialog: the records room without my
dialog: express permission.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: (over this, quietly)
dialog: Enter the doctor.
dialog: (to Mathias)
dialog: Forgive me. I prefer to see the
dialog: event alone, without bias.
text: Mathias looks at the hologram -- realizes which one it is.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: I need to see your clearance.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: You're right to insist. I know
dialog: you've had security issues here.
text: He places his hand on a screen as he says it. Mathias looks
text: at the readout, and drops the bluster.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: Apologies. An Operative of the
dialog: Parliament will of course have
dialog: full cooperation.
dialog: (looks at screen)
dialog: I'm not sure what... I see no
dialog: listing of rank, or name.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: I have neither. Like this
dialog: facility, I don't exist. The
dialog: Parliament calls me in when...
dialog: when they wish they didn't have
dialog: to. Let's talk about the Tams.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: I assume you've scanned the status
dialog: logs...
speaker_heading: VJ
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: River was your greatest success.
dialog: A prodigy -- A phenomenon. Until
dialog: her brother walked in eight months
dialog: ago and took her from you.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: It's not quite so simple.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: I'm very aware of that.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
text: He came in with full creds. He
dialog: beat the ap-scan, the retinal...
dialog: There was no way I could --
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: No, no. Of course. The boy spent
dialog: his fortune developing the
dialog: contacts to infiltrate this place.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: Gave up a brilliant future in.
dialog: medicine as well, you've probably
text: read. Turned his back on his
dialog: whole life. Madness.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: Madness, no. Something a good
dialog: deal more dangerous. Have you
dialog: looked at this scan carefully? At
dialog: his face?
text: Mathias looks uncertain.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: It's love, in point of fact. He
dialog: loved his sister and he knew she
dialog: was in pain. So he took her
text: somewhere safe.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: I'm here because the situation is
dialog: even less simple than you think.
dialog: (eyeing him)
dialog: Do you know what your sin is,
dialog: Doctor?
speaker_heading: J
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: I. I would be very careful about
dialog: what you --
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
speaker_heading: (SADLY)
dialog: It's pride.
text: He touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps
text: to the Doctor and Simon in the lab, Mathias repeating:
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: Key members of Parliament have
dialog: personally observed this subject.
dialog: I was told their support --
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: (shutting it off)
dialog: Key members of Parliament. Key.
dialog: The minds behind every diplomatic,
dialog: military and covert operation in
dialog: the galaxy, and you put them in a
text: room with a psychic.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: She was... she read cards, nothing
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: It's come to our attention that
dialog: River became much more unstable,
dialog: more... disturbed, after you
dialog: showed her off to Parliament. Did
dialog: she see something very terrible in
dialog: those cards?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: Whatever... secrets she might have
dialog: accidentally gleaned... it's
dialog: probable she doesn't even know she
dialog: knows them. That they're buried
dialog: beneath --
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
text: But they are in her. Her mind is
dialog: unquiet. It's the will of the
dialog: Parliament that I kill her. And
dialog: the brother. Because of your sin.
speaker_heading: J
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: (continuing; moving
dialog: to his briefcase)
dialog: You know, in certain older
dialog: civilized cultures, when men
dialog: failed as entirely as you have,
dialog: they would throw themselves on
dialog: their swords.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: (fed up)
dialog: Well, unfortunately I forgot to
dialog: bring a sword to --
text: The air rings crisply as the Operative pulls out his sword.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: The Parliament has no further
dialog: interest in psychics. They
dialog: represent a threat to the harmony
dialog: and stability of our Alliance.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR MATHIAS
dialog: I would put that down right now if
dialog: I were you.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: Would you be killed in your sleep,
dialog: like an ailing pet? Whatever your
dialog: failings, I believe you deserve
dialog: better than that.
text: The agents move. He slices the throat of the one behind him
text: with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling out
text: his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying agent
text: reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm.
text: The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as
text: quietly as the first.
text: Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He
text: bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spine.
text: Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile.
text: The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid grimace
text: for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee and
text: holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and point
text: tilted toward the doctor. The Doctor stares at it in horror
text: as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it.
text: The Operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Young miss, I'll need all the logs-
dialog: on behavioral modification
dialog: triggers. We'll have to reach out
dialog: to River Tam, and help her to come
dialog: back to us. No matter how far out
dialog: Simon has taken her, we can --
text: He's almost startled when the Doctor's body drops into frame,
text: slowed suddenly by the sword. It squeaks down the blade, the
text: Doctor unable to cry out, as the Operative whispers to him:
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: This is a good death. There's no
dialog: shame in this, in a man's death.
dialog: A man who's done fine works.
dialog: We're making a better world. All
dialog: of them, better worlds.
text: Mathias is dead. The Operative pulls the sword out as the
text: body rolls over. As he wipes the sword down:
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Young miss, I need you to get to
dialog: work now. I think I may have a
dialog: long way to travel.
dialog: 40
text: She goes. He approaches River, very close, staring...

text: the same in Chinese behind it.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE, ORBITING THE MOON "LILAC" - DAY
text: We move away from the ship. The name is on the nose, under
text: the bridge. It sticks out from the body of the ship like a
text: craning neck. The body is bulbous, with propulsion engines
text: on either side and a giant glowing back. There are two small
text: shuttles tucked in over the 'wings' of the engines. It's not
dialog: the sleekest ship in the 'verse, to be sure.
text: As it hits atmo, the propulsion engines take over and she
text: starts to rock a bit, noise filling our ears. Camera comes
text: around the front, at the windows and into the bridge, to see
text: the Captain, MALCOLM 'MAL' REYNOLDS, standing and watching.
text: At that moment, a small piece of the nose breaks off and goes
text: flying past the window.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
dialog: [Note: the following sequence will take us through the ship
text: in one extended STEADICAM shot.]
text: The bridge is small: two pilot seats on either side, and a
text: tangle of wires and machinery all about.
text: Mal wears the knee-length brown coat and boots of an old
text: Independent. Gun at his hip. He's not unlike the ship --
dialog: he's seen a bit of the world and it left him, emotionally at
text: least, weathered. Right now, though, he's mostly startled.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: What was that?
text: He's addressing the pilot, WASH. Flight gear and a hawaiian
text: shirt, toy dinosaurs populating his station -- no old
text: soldier, but just as startled.
speaker_heading: WASH
dialog: Whoah! Did you see that --
dialog: The ship bucks --
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Was that the primary buffer panel?
speaker_heading: WASH

dialog: apparent reason?
dialog: Another buck --
speaker_heading: WASH
dialog: Looks like.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: I thought Kaylee checked our entry
dialog: couplings! I have a very clear
dialog: memory of it --
speaker_heading: WASH
dialog: Yeah well if she doesn't give us
dialog: some extra flow from the engine
dialog: room to offset the burnthrough
dialog: this landing is gonna get pretty
dialog: interesting.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Define "Interesting".
speaker_heading: WASH

dialog: "Oh god, oh god, we're all gonna
dialog: die?"
speaker_heading: J
speaker_heading: MAL

dialog: Can you shave the vector --
speaker_heading: WASH
dialog: I'm doing it! It's not enough.

speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: we're gonna explode? I don't
dialog: wanna explode.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Jayne, how many weapons you plan

text: All that plays in the background as we lead Mal into the:
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUING
text: It's the communal space of the ship, homey and messy. There
text: is food left lying on the table. Mal swipes a dumpling from
text: a plate, pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and
text: sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Kaylee!

scene_heading: INT. AFT HALL/ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUING
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: (still calling)
text: Kaylee, what in the sphincter of
dialog: hell are you playing at?
text: The hall leads to the rust-brown chaos that is the engine
text: room. Working around the engine in a forest of wires, sparks
text: and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic, KAYLEE. She passes
text: Mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the
text: doorway, raising his voice above the din.
speaker_heading: MAL

speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: This isn't fear. This is anger.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: 4 (LAUGHS)
dialog: Well, it's kinda hard to tell the

dialog: And it's time your little sister
dialog: learned from your fine example.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: I've earned my passage treating
dialog: bullet holes, knife wounds, laser
dialog: burns...
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Some of our jobs are trickier than
dialog: others --
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: And you want to put my sister in
text: the middle of that.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Didn't say 'want'. Said 'will'.
dialog: It's one job, Doc. She'll be fine.
text: The passenger dorm has a time-worn warmth that most of the
text: ship shares. Except, of course, for the sterile blue of:
scene_heading: INT. INFIRMARY - CONTINUING
text: Into which the two men step.
speaker_heading: SIMON
text: She's a seventeen year old girl.
dialog: A mentally traumatized sevente--
speaker_heading: J
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: She's a reader. Sees into the
dialog: truth of things; might see trouble
dialog: before it's coming. Which is of
dialog: use to me.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: And that's your guiding star,
dialog: isn't it? What's of use.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Honestly, doctor, I think we may
dialog: really crash this time anyway.
text: Simon jabs the inoculation needle into Mal's arm.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Do you understand what I've gone
dialog: through to keep River away from
dialog: the Alliance?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: I do, and it's a fact me and mine
dialog: have been courteous enough to keep
dialog: to our own selves.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Are you threatening to --
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: I got one purpose here: keep this
dialog: boat in the air. I take the jobs
dialog: I get -- which is less and less,
dialog: case you ain't been keeping track.
text: He starts away, Simon still keeping pace.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Every year since the war the
dialog: Alliance pushes just a little
text: further out towards the rim.
dialog: Makes it a chore for naughty men
dialog: like us to slip about -- and
dialog: keeping you two on board means
dialog: working twice as hard to avoid the
dialog: law. Means turning down a score
dialog: of honest jobs.
speaker_heading: J

scene_heading: INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING
text: They enter the biggest space on the ship. Giant doors sit at
text: the front, which will open upon landing to reveal a lowering
text: ramp. Catwalks surround the space, leading up at the front to
text: the foredeck hall. We've come all the way through Serenity.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: So here is us, on the raggedy
dialog: edge. Don't push me and I won't
dialog: push you.
text: Simon starts up the stairs as Mal calls to him:
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Things get gritty I will keep her
text: from the fray, but she's coming.
dialog: Best you get her ready.
text: As Mal walks on, we tilt up to see the Mule, a four-man
text: hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling. Jayne and
text: Zoe are tossing duffle bags into it.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Zoe, is Wash gonna straighten this
dialog: boat out before we get flattened?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Like a downy feather, sir. Nobody
dialog: flies like my mister.
text: The camera picks up Simon's feet as they enter foreground on
text: the catwalk, and track with them to find:
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: River...
text: She's lying on her side, looking straight at us. A loose
text: summer dress draped over her small frame.
speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: I know. We're going for a ride.
scene_heading: EXT. LILAC -- DESERT GULCH - DAY
text: Serenity settles gently down as the cargo bay door opens.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING
text: The chains are hoisted back up into the ceiling of the ship.
text: The mule floats just above the floor, Jayne piling in next to
dialog: River in the back:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Now, River, you stay behind the
dialog: others. If there's fighting you
text: drop to the floor or run away.
dialog: It's okay to leave them to die.
text: River puts on a huge pair of goggles, looks at her brother.
speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: I'm the brains of the operation.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: We should hit town right during
dialog: Sunday worship. Won't be any
dialog: crowds.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: If Fanty and Mingo are right about
dialog: the payroll, this could look to be
dialog: a sunny day for us.
speaker_heading: SIMON
speaker_heading: (APPROACHING)
dialog: Captain, I'll ask you one last
dialog: time...
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Doctor, I'm taking your sister
dialog: under my protection here. If
dialog: anything happens to her, anything
dialog: at all, I swear to you I will get
dialog: very choked up. Honestly. There
dialog: could be tears.
text: He peels out, leaves Simon fuming. Kaylee sidles up to him...
speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: Don't mind the Captain none,
dialog: Simon. I know he'll look out for
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: It's amazing. I bring River all
text: the way out to the raggedy edge of
dialog: the 'verse so she can hide from
dialog: the Alliance by robbing banks.
speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: It's just a little Trading
dialog: Station. They'll be back 'fore
dialog: you can spit.
dialog: (as he stalks off)
dialog: Not that you spit...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
text: Kaylee watches him go, a tad forlorn.
scene_heading: EXT. LILAC - DAY
text: We see the town sprawled before us, as the mule heads in.
text: The town embodies the lives of folk out here: adobe and wood
dialog: mix with metal and plastic -- whatever's on hand to build
text: with. Right now the streets are mainly empty.
scene_heading: EXT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING
text: The mule pulls up, Zoe hitching it as they speak:
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: What are we hoping to find here
dialog: that equals the worth of a turd?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Alliance payroll. There's peace
dialog: enforcing squads stationed all
dialog: about this quadrant. Can't use
dialog: credits out here -- they got to
dialog: pay their boys in cashy money.
dialog: Which once a month rests here.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Something about stealing from the
dialog: Alliance just warms a body like
dialog: whiskey in winter.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: (cocks his gun)
dialog: Shiny. Let's be badguys.
text: Mal turns back to River.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: You ready to go to work, darlin'?
speaker_heading: RIVER
text: There's no pattern to the pebbles
dialog: here, they're completely random.
dialog: I tried to count them but you
text: drove too fast. Hummingbird.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: (never mind)
dialog: Right. Great. Let's go.
scene_heading: INT. TRADING STATION - DAY
text: We are in a camera's eye view, right above the door.
speaker_heading: J
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
text: The door slams open, Mal and Jayne stride in, Zoe following
text: and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking.
text: Reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with
text: "Welcome to Lilac" on it for the millisecond before it's
text: blown to bits.
text: There's maybe fifteen people in the place: store workers,
dialog: farm-folk and a couple dirt-poor kids. It's a combination
text: post-office, general store, bank, and most other things.
speaker_heading: MAL
text: Hands and knees and heads bowed
dialog: down! Everybody, now!
text: Two men who appear to be farm folk rush Mal and the others.
text: Mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks.
text: Mal's gun is long, not unlike Civil War era issue, but very
dialog: much new in design.
text: The other tries to tackle Jayne, which is not necessarily a
text: great idea. Jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right
text: upside-down -- and Jayne grabs him by the legs and CRACK! --
text: bounces his head right off the floor, knocking him out cold.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Y'all wanna be looking very
dialog: intently at your own belly
text: buttons. I see a head start to
text: rise, violence is gonna ensue.
text: The guy who rushed Mal complies along with everyone else.
text: Jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty
text: shirt to reveal the purple of an Alliance uniform.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: Looks like this is the place.
text: He looks up at Mal, who motions for Zoe to open the front
text: door. She does, and River steps in.
text: ANGLE: RIVER'S BARE FEET -- walking slowly among the hunched-
text: over customers as Mal addresses them.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: You've probably guessed we mean to
dialog: be thieving here, but what we are
dialog: after is not yours. So let's have
text: no undue fussing.
text: As he is speaking, Jayne is scrambling to the back office,
text: finding the small vault locked.
speaker_heading: 1410
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
text: She's locked up.
text: River suddenly looks around, perturbed.
text: CLOSE ON: a young tough.
text: River looks up at Zoe, alarmed, and silently points to the
text: young man. He is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt.
text: He finds Zoe's sawed-off nuzzling his cheek.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You know what the definition of a
dialog: hero is? It's someone who gets
dialog: other people killed. You can look
dialog: it up later.
text: He drops his weapon, slides it across the floor.
text: Mal moves to the Trade Agent. Hauls him up, tosses him
text: toward the vault. Zoe and Jayne follow.
speaker_heading: TRADE AGENT
dialog: This is just a crop moon, don't
dialog: think you'll find what you --
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: (in Chinese)
dialog: 140
text: The old man punches in the code. What opens is a tiny wall
text: safe. Bundles of bills, some scattered coin. Unimpressive.
text: Jayne and Zoe are behind the captain, peering in.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: At last. We can retire and give
dialog: up this life of crime.
text: Mal reaches in, pulls a lever and the floor opens, a six foot
text: hole appearing, stairs leading to a corridor, all gleaming
text: metal and blue light. Zoe smiles. Jayne peers down as Mal
text: addresses the Trade Agent.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Is there a fed down there? Be
dialog: truthful.
speaker_heading: TRADE AGENT
speaker_heading: (NODDING)
dialog: Y'all are Browncoats, hey? Fought
dialog: for independence?
speaker_heading: VJ
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: War's long done. We're all just
dialog: folk now.
dialog: (calls down)
dialog: Listen up! We are coming down to
dialog: empty that vault!
text: The voice of a young Alliance GUARD comes up from below.
speaker_heading: GUARD (O.S.)
dialog: You have to give me your
dialog: authorization password!
text: Jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine-gun fire down into
text: the hole. A beat...
speaker_heading: GUARD (O . S . )
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Okay...
text: Mal looks at Zoe and they head down into:
scene_heading: INT. VAULT - CONTINUING
text: Which is as modern as something off the Central Planets. A
text: short corridor leads to a real vault door, that the guard is
text: already opening. Behind that door, a few bags of the real
text: deal: neatly stacked cash, waiting to be robbed.
scene_heading: INT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING
text: We move in on River as something crosses her face. Worry.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN - DAY
text: A WOMAN carrying a bucket and her nine year old SON are
text: looking at the trading station a few buildings away.
speaker_heading: SON
dialog: Repeater.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Did sound summat like gunblast...
dialog: Maybe you aught run tell Lawman...
text: She turns and right by her, in the shadows, is a man.
text: Mostly. He is hideously disfigured, a combination of self-
text: mutilation and the bubbling red of radiation poisoning. His
text: clothes are rags, his eyes pinpoints of glazed madness.
text: A blade blurs through frame...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: INT. TRADING STATION - CONTINUING
text: River SCREAMS and flops onto her back, pinned by revelation.
text: Others look at her, concerned, as Jayne makes his way to her.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: What the hell is up? You all
dialog: right? What's goin' on?
text: He holds her, as she whispers, wide-eyed...
speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: Reavers.
scene_heading: INT. VAULT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Zoe is hauling out the last of five bags as Mal talks to the
text: guard, holding his gun at him:
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Leg's good, it'll bleed plenty and
dialog: we avoid any necessary organs...
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: I was thinking more of a graze..
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Well you don't want it to look
dialog: like you just gave up...
speaker_heading: JAYNE (O.S.)
speaker_heading: MAL!
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Every heist, he's gotta start
dialog: yelling my name --
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: (barreling in)
dialog: Mal! Reavers! The girl's
dialog: pitchin' a fit. They're here or
dialog: they're comin' soon.
text: He is already loading up with bags as Mal thinks quickly.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: (to Zoe and Jayne)
dialog: Get on the mule.
dialog: (to the guard,
dialog: pointing to the
speaker_heading: VAULT)
dialog: Does that open from the inside?
speaker_heading: J
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Whah -ah- yes...
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: You get everyone upstairs in there
dialog: and you seal it. Long as you got
dialog: air you don't open up, you
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: I -- Buh I --
text: Mal is in his face, dark and huge:
speaker_heading: MAL
text: GET THEM INSIDE THE VAULT.
scene_heading: EXT. TRADING STATION - DAY
text: The doors burst open, Jayne and Zoe coming out first, Mal
text: behind with River in hand. She is freaked, in her own space.
text: Jayne and Zoe throw the bags on --
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Zoe take the wheel --
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: You see 'em? Anybody see 'em?
text: 1J -- and jump on themselves, Mal scanning the area as he hands
text: River up to Jayne's care. As the craft powers up, slowly
text: moving, the young man Zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon
text: bursts out of the station, grabbing the back of the mule.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Take me with you!
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Get in the vault with the others --
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: I can't stay here! Please!
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: It's too many. Drive, Zoe.
text: A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the size
text: of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded
text: conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator,
text: pure. It disappears over the rooftops.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
speaker_heading: PLEASE!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Drive!
text: Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floors
text: it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust.
text: As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shadows
text: and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun.
text: He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back.
text: Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the
text: chest, slumps down dead.
scene_heading: ANGLE: THE EDGE OF TOWN
text: As the mule shoots past the last building, we see a skiff
text: shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street,
dialog: right abreast of our gang.
scene_heading: ANGLE: THE CENTER OF TOWN
text: We see the church as the first ship and an even larger one
text: come to hover over it, Reavers dropping down on cable lines
text: to swarm into it.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING
text: The mule and the skiff are booking through the rocky terrain.
text: The skiff swings closer, but Jayne peppers it with automatic
text: fire and it swings away. There is sporadic return fire.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: How come they ain't blowing us out
dialog: of the air?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: They wanna run us down. The up-
dialog: close kill.
text: River is squashed down on her back, being very small.
speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: They want us alive when they eat
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: Boy, sure would be nice if we had
dialog: some grenades, don'tchya think?
text: Mal says nothing, keeps firing.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Wash, baby can you hear me?
speaker_heading: VO
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: INT. SERENITY: BRIDGE - CONTINUING
text: Wash is in a frenzy of switchflipping, prepping for take-off.
speaker_heading: WASH
dialog: We're moments from air. You got
dialog: somebody behind you?
dialog: We intercut Wash and Zoe at this point:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Reavers.
speaker_heading: WASH
speaker_heading: (BLANCHING)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: We're not gonna reach you in time.
speaker_heading: WASH
dialog: Just keep moving, honey. We're
dialog: coming to you.
scene_heading: EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING
text: As she lifts off and starts heading toward the others.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING
text: Zoe gets the mule in front but a harpoon thwinngs through the
text: air from the skiff and S} NK! Goes through Jayne's leg.. The
text: harpoon grips the leg and pulls --
text: Jayne goes flying off the back of the Mule, Mal just grabbing
text: him as the harpoon line reels slowly tighter --
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Grab on!
text: Jayne grabs the Mule, legs dangling, pulled out between the
text: two vessels as Mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: I won't get et! You shoot me if
dialog: they take me!
text: Mal steadies himself and takes aim, seemingly at Jayne --
speaker_heading: JAYNE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Well don't shoot me first!
speaker_heading: J
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
text: Mal fires. Again. Steadies himself for one more...
text: The line holding the harpoon is split by Mal's third shot.
speaker_heading: V0V
text: The mule surges forward as Jayne drags on the ground. Mal
text: hauls him in as River bounds into the front to make room.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Rutting pigs! Where's --
text: And River is holding out his weapon before he can ask for it.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE DESERT - CONTINUING
text: Serenity rushes across the desert floor, not much higher off
dialog: it than the smaller crafts.
speaker_heading: WASH
dialog: (to Zoe)
dialog: Get some distance on 'em. You come
dialog: to the flats, I want you to swing
dialog: round. Gonna try a Barn Swallow.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
text: Wash hits the com.
speaker_heading: WASH
dialog: J Simon! Open the loading dock!
scene_heading: INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING
text: Simon moves next to the huge sliding doors at the front, hits
text: a couple of buttons. The doors pull open, as the huge ramp
text: beyond them opens down, letting in a rush of wind and light.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING
text: The mule reaches the flats, away from the rocks.
speaker_heading: WASH (O.S.)
dialog: (in Zoe's ear)
dialog: Okay, baby, we've talked this
dialog: through...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Talkin' ain't doin'.
text: She throws the wheel and the mule comes hard about,
text: fishtailing slightly as it faces the oncoming skiff.
speaker_heading: WASH (O.S.)
dialog: Don't slow down!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: ANGLE: THE SKIFF
text: As it heads for the mule --
speaker_heading: ANGLE: THE MULE
text: As it heads for the skiff -- and Serenity swoops down out of
text: the sky, bay doors open, and comes right up behind it -- The
text: Mule swallowed by the bigger ship --
scene_heading: INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING
text: And only its forward momentum keeps it from being squashed as
text: it flies backwards into the bay, narrowly missing Simon and
text: smashing back into the staircase, sparks and people flying --
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - CONTINUING
text: Serenity tries to get altitude -- but slams right into the
text: oncoming skiff, tearing it apart --
scene_heading: INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING
text: A flaming portion of the top flies in, skids to the floor as
text: small fires erupt from the mule as well -- Simon pulls a
text: lever and jets of C02 shoot out of the floor.
text: Simon hits the button to start the outer ramp closing, then
text: runs to the mule. The C02 stops and he finds River sitting
text: in her seat, completely unharmed. Zoe is climbing painfully
text: out of the other seat, Mal and Jayne both having been thrown.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: River?
speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: I swallowed a bug.
text: Kaylee runs in to see how everyone is. She goes to Simon.
speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Is he okay?
text: A bloodied Reaver POPS into frame from under the skiff-top.
text: He lunges for Mal, baring sharpened teeth --
text: Mal spins and draws, fires into his belly as Jayne and Zoe
text: both fire at the same time. The freak takes too long to go
text: down, but down he goes. Dies sitting against the s i op.
text: 4 Everybody takes a moment to look at each other.

speaker_heading: WASH (O.S.)

scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
speaker_heading: WASH

scene_heading: INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING
speaker_heading: MAL
text: Set course for Beaumonde.

speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: You stupid, selfish, son of a

speaker_heading: MAL

speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: "One simple job! She'll be fine!"
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: She IS fine! Except for bein'

speaker_heading: ZOE

speaker_heading: SIMON

speaker_heading: J

speaker_heading: MAL

speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Well sleep easy 'cause we're off
dialog: your boat. Just as soon as River
dialog: gets her share of the "bounty".
speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: Well let's not do anything hasty...
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: No, shiny! I'm sick a' carrying
dialog: tourists anyhow. We'll be on
dialog: Beaumonde in ten hours time, you

dialog: on your merry. Meantime you do
dialog: your job. Patch up my crew.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: RIVER

scene_heading: INT. FOREDECK HALL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mal and Zoe enter from below.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No, I think things'll glide a deal
dialog: smoother for us without River and
dialog: Simon on board... but how long do
dialog: you think they'll last?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Doc made his call. They's as
dialog: babes in a basket when we took 'em
dialog: in; we sheltered 'em plenty. Man
dialog: has to cut loose, learn to stand
text: on his own.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Like that man back in town?
text: They stop by Mal Is room.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: I had to shoot him. What the

speaker_heading: J
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I know. That was a piece a'

dialog: vo,
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: We couldn't take the weight.
dialog: Woulda slowed us down.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You know that for certain
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Mule won't run with five. I

dialog: Or Jayne?
speaker_heading: (CONSIDERING)
dialog: Well, Jayne...
speaker_heading: ZOE
text: Coulda tossed the payload.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: And go to Fanty and Mingo with air
dialog: in our mitts, tell 'em "here's
dialog: your share"? They'd set the dogs
text: on us in the space of a twitch,
dialog: and there we are back in mortal
dialog: peril. We get a job, we gotta

text: Washenters from the bridge.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Sir, I don't disagree on any
dialog: particular point, it's just... in
dialog: the time of war, we woulda never
text: left a man stranded.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Maybe that's why we lost.
text: She's not happy with the reply. Mal climbs down to his room
text: as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his arms around her.
scene_heading: INT. MAL'S ROOM - CONTINUING
text: Once alone, Mal lets his own disappointment show. He pulls
text: off his holster and drops it over a chair. Kicks the toilet
text: closed and sits on his bunk.
text: The place resembles a submarine cabin, with charts and
text: clutter, ancient maps on the walls.
speaker_heading: J

speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: Kaylee, are you ever gonna put
dialog: that capture down?
speaker_heading: KAYLEE (0.5.)
dialog: We gotta have records of
dialog: everything. A bona fide Companion
dialog: entertained clients on this very
dialog: ship! In this very bed!
text: The picture pans over to the bed -- which River is bending

speaker_heading: KAYLEE (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: For one sweet second, we was
text: almost classy.
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: 4 You promised to help me pack.
speaker_heading: KAYLEE (O.S.)
dialog: Honest, Inara, why do you have to
dialog: leave?
text: Inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera -- and the
text: picture freezes, goes back to the beginning.
text: During all this, Mal has picked it up. He looks at it a
text: moment, tosses it aside. Looks around at nothing much.
speaker_heading: JAYNE (V.0.)
dialog: I do not get it. How's a guy get
dialog: so wrong?
scene_heading: INT. CARGO BAY - LATER
text: We see the doors in the floor slide open, a second set below.

dialog: Ain't logical. Cuttin' on his own

dialog: mean, I'll kill a man in a fair
dialog: fight... or if I think he's gonna
dialog: start a fair fight, or if he
dialog: bothers me, or if there's a woman,
dialog: or I'm gettin' paid -- mostly only
dialog: when I'm gettin' paid. But these

text: He dumps the body in, she starts the doors closing.
speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: Shepherd Book said they was men
dialog: that reached the edge of space.,
dialog: saw a vasty nothingness and just
text: went bibbledy over it.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: Hell, I been to the edge. Just
dialog: looked like more space.
speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: I don't know. People get awful
dialog: lonely in the black. Like to get
dialog: addlepated ourselves, we stay on
dialog: this boat much longer. Captain'll
dialog: drive us all off, one by one.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: You're just in a whinge cuz that
text: prissy doc is finally
dialog: disembarking. Me I says good
dialog: riddance. He never belonged here,
dialog: and his sister's no saner than one
dialog: of them Reavers.
speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: That ain't even so! River's a
dialog: dear heart and a boon to this

scene_heading: INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY
text: And here she is, moving back and down into frame, her eyes
text: half closed in passion. She settles on a cluster of brocaded
text: pillows, and we see another head lowering in for a kiss...
dialog: Come around to see it's another lovely young woman -- and
text: that there is a group of ten others watching intently, all in
text: saris, on their knees. Two handsome young men with shaved
text: heads in the back, also on their knees.
text: Inara stops before the kiss, smiling and coming back up. She
text: speaks to the girls (We hear only soft music) as she
text: repositions the one she's with, lowering again; showing her
text: the motion of surrender as if it were a dance step.

scene_heading: EXT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DUSK
text: Inara looks out at the mountains. The space she's in

text: the woman whose voice we heard. She hands Inara a drink.
speaker_heading: SHEYDRA
dialog: The girls. They've learned more

speaker_heading: INARA

speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: On Sihnon we started training at

speaker_heading: SHEYDRA
dialog: They're all of good family, the

speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: Control. Was the first lesson.
dialog: And the last and these worlds are
dialog: not like the Central Planets.
text: There is barbarism dressed up in
dialog: the most civil weeds. Men of the
dialog: highest rank who don't know the
dialog: difference between a Companion and
dialog: a common whore. It's unsafe.
speaker_heading: SHEYDRA
dialog: All the more reason the girls look
dialog: to you. You came out here alone,
dialog: before the Alliance ever thought
dialog: to establish a House this remote.
dialog: You've seen so much. You're a
dialog: figure of great romance to them.
speaker_heading: 4d INARA
dialog: Great romance has nothing to do
dialog: with being a Companion, Sheydra.
dialog: You should know better.
speaker_heading: SHEYDRA
dialog: I'm not the one who had a torrid

text: Inara nearly spills her drink.
speaker_heading: INARA

speaker_heading: SHEYDRA
speaker_heading: (SMILING)

dialog: In one of the stories you make
dialog: love in a burning temple. I think
dialog: that's my favorite.
speaker_heading: INARA
speaker_heading: (SITTING)
dialog: This is unbearable. Captain
dialog: Reynolds is no pirate; he's a
dialog: petty thief. And he never laid a
dialog: finger on me. All he ever did was
dialog: rent me a shuttle and be very
dialog: annoying.
dialog: (mutters in Chinese)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEYDRA
dialog: A year on his shuttle and he never
dialog: laid a finger on you. No wonder
dialog: you left.
speaker_heading: INARA
speaker_heading: (BRIDLING)
dialog: I left because -- go away. We're
dialog: no longer friends. You're a
dialog: stranger to me now.
speaker_heading: SHEYDRA
dialog: 104 I do love to watch you boil.
dialog: Don't worry. The stories will

dialog: has probably gotten himself blown

dialog: It's a dead giveaway you don't

dialog: Don't pay anybody in advance. And
dialog: don't ride in anything with a

scene_heading: INT. THE MAIDENHEAD - CONTINUING
text: We start on a CorVue screen, showing a news report. On the

speaker_heading: NEWSPERSON (V.O.)

text: During this we come around to see that the screen has a

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: It's not my fault the Doc's got no

speaker_heading: KAYLEE

dialog: might've --
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: What? Swept you into his cleanly
dialog: arms? Made tidy love to you?
text: They have reached the guncheck, where Jayne and Wash have
text: already checked their guns. It works like a lunch automat:
text: Mal sticks his gun in a drawer, pulls out a chit -- the
text: q0 drawer closes and rotates, revealing another empty one. A
text: large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively.
speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: (as they continue
speaker_heading: DOWN)
dialog: Don't you dare joke! You know how
dialog: much I pined on Simon. And him

speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (ENOUGH)
dialog: You knew he was gonna leave. We
dialog: never been but a way station to

dialog: you... if I truly wanted someone
dialog: bad enough, wouldn't be a thing in

speaker_heading: KAYLEE

speaker_heading: MINGO

speaker_heading: FANTY

text: FANTY moves out from behind Mingo to reveal that he is
text: Mingo's identical twin. Apart from slight differences in
text: dress, they are indistinguishable.
speaker_heading: MINGO
dialog: 'Cause we don't wanna interrupt.
speaker_heading: FANTY

speaker_heading: MINGO

speaker_heading: MAL

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: (to Zoe)
dialog: It's business. We're fine.

text: ANGLE: THE CORVUE CAMERA'S POV of the men is conveniently
text: blocked by her little dance.

speaker_heading: MINGO
dialog: How you keep them on that crap

dialog: tween me and Fanty.
speaker_heading: FANTY
dialog: We go on and on.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: So I'm noticing. Is there a
dialog: problem I don't know of? You got
dialog: 25% of a sweet take kissing your
dialog: foot, how come we're not
dialog: dispersing?
speaker_heading: FANTY
dialog: Our end is forty, precious.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: My muscular buttocks it's forty --
speaker_heading: MINGO

text: business. We stay on her as she wanders around the perimeter
text: of the bar, vaguely listening in on Mal's deal.
speaker_heading: FANTY
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: You're unlikable, Mal. You got no
dialog: respect for us above you, you got

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Well here's a foul thought. I

speaker_heading: MINGO
dialog: That were a sign of faith, boy.

dialog: And she whispers:
speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: Miranda.
text: She turns and looks back at the crowd.
text: What happens next happens very fast.
text: She strides silently to the first table -- two men drinking
text: quietly -- and she slams her foot into one's face, then whips
text: it back into the other's, knocking them both unconscious as --
text: people are turning, just registering that this girl --
text: kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a

text: precision -- Two men come from either side, one whipping out
text: a knife -- she does a perfect split, grabs his wrist above
text: her head, using his momentum to stab the other one --
text: Mal fights to get back to the gunrack. The bouncer reaches
text: her and she wrests his shockrod from him, uses it on him, on
text: Fanty and Mingo -- the fan-dancer is bolting and River hurls
text: the rod at her head, knocks her cold...
dialog: She's everywhere. On tables, chairs, under your legs, using
text: the room itself to take out every single person there. One
text: man hides behind a wall -- impossibly, she swings her leg
text: around the corner and nails his face.
text: Jayne grabs her from behind --
speaker_heading: JAYNE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Gorrammit, girl, it's me!
text: She grabs his crotch and squeezes -- his grip loosens and she
text: spins, facing him, and flat-heels his nose with her palm,
text: V0 twirling into a gut kick that doubles him over, dispatching
text: of another while she cracks Jayne's head with a small table --
text: Somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow, causing him to
text: scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut --
text: Mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as River
text: knocks the other guy's gun in the air, kicks someone else and
text: then catches it, whips it around just as Mal comes up with
text: his, they are pointed right at each other --
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Eta Kooram Nah Smech!
text: And River drops to the ground, fast asleep.
text: There is a beat. Mal looks around the bar. He and Simon,

dialog: There's a number of lives that
dialog: hang in the balance here. Lives
dialog: under your care. Are they as
dialog: whimsical as yourself?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: I got no notion that I'm being
dialog: heroical at all. Any more than I
dialog: think you're really just a
dialog: harmless bureaucrat come to help
dialog: me out. You move like a killer.
text: The Operative is stopped by this. Unhappily, he continues:
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: I have a warship in deep orbit,
dialog: Captain. We locked on to
text: Serenity's pulse beacon the moment
dialog: you hit atmo. I can speak a word
dialog: and send a missile to that exact
text: location inside of three minutes.
text: Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all
text: around it, and tosses it to the Operative.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: You do that, best make peace with
dialog: your dear and fluffy lord.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
text: Pulse beacon.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Advice from an old tracker: you
dialog: J wanna find someone, use your eyes.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: How long do you think you can
dialog: really run from us?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Oh, a jack-rabbit, me. 'Sides, I
dialog: never credited the Alliance with
dialog: an over-abundance of brains. And
dialog: if you're the best they got...
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: Captain Reynolds, I should tell
dialog: you so that you don't waste your
dialog: time: You can't make me angry.
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: Oh please. Spend an hour with him.
text: Mal smiles -- then glares at Inara, mouthing "Hey!"
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: I need her, Captain. River is...
dialog: my purpose and I will gather her
dialog: to me. The brother as well.
dialog: Whatever else happens is
dialog: incidental. In the greater scheme.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Why is it that the greater scheme
dialog: always makes everything not that
dialog: great?
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: I want to resolve this like
dialog: civilized men. I'm not
dialog: threatening you. I'm unarmed.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Great!
text: He draws and shoots the Operative in the chest. The
text: Operative goes down as Mal grabs Inara, moves for the-doorway.
text: The Operative is on him in a second, choke-hold from behind.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: I am of course wearing full body
dialog: armor. I'm not a moron.
text: He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking a
text: blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts,
text: but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds.
text: Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operative
text: kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal gets
text: to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose
text: dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: No back up? We're making an awful
dialog: ruckus...
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: They'll come when they're needed.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: I'd start whistling.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: Captain, what do you think is
dialog: going to happen here?
text: They come at each other. The Operative is the much better
text: trained -- he's fluid, his blows sparse and deadly.
dialog: 40
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
text: Mal is more bluster and determination, and the operative's
text: precision is wearing Mal down.
text: Mal punches wild -- the Operative counters with a spin-kick
text: V0 to the head that sends Mal to the ground not far from Inara,
text: breathing hard. He tries to rise again, painfully, but Inara
text: places her hand on his arm.
text: The Operative goes to his briefcase by the door, pulls out
text: his sword. His face has taken on that remote kind of
text: fascination as he looks at it.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Nothing here is what it seems.
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: He's not the plucky hero. The
dialog: Alliance isn't some evil empire.
dialog: This isn't the grand arena.
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: And that's not incense.
text: He turns to look: the incense stick burns away -- rather like
text: a fuse -- and FLASHES in an explosion of light and sound.
dialog: 40
text: It's a flash-bomb: The Operative sails back as everything
text: goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz.
text: The Operative tries to get his bearings -- and four armored
text: soldiers are in his face, asking him for orders... Mal and
text: Inara are gone. He motions for the men to follow them.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: Just a flash bomb. Go! Go!
scene_heading: INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - CONTINUING
text: Inara leads Mal (who is reholstering his gun) down some steps
text: and along a corridor. The sound is still tinny and weird.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: .I had him...
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: (deafly loud)
dialog: I think that I was winning!

scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF MOUNTAIN, BY MAL'S SHUTTLE - DAY
text: Mal and Inara move quickly down the mountain. They look to
text: see that Mal's shuttle has four Alliance guards waiting by
text: V0 it. Mal ducks back out of sight, pulls a fancy-looking
text: grenade out of his pocket. Pops the top and hurls it over at
text: the foursome.
text: CLOSE ON: THE GRENADE, as a series of bars of light go out
dialog: one by one, counting down --
speaker_heading: ALLIANCE SOLDIER
dialog: Grenade!
text: Everybody dives for cover. The moment they do, Mal and Inara
text: race into the shuttle, Mal sweeping up the grenade just as
text: the last light goes out and nothing happens.
text: One soldier turns to look and Mal shoots him back down as the
text: door shuts on him and Inara.
scene_heading: INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING
text: Inara pushes into the pilot's seat.
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: Hang on to something.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: 4 You sure you remember how it --
text: He nearly falls over as:
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUING
text: The shuttle shoots straight up, spinning and heading out.
scene_heading: INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUING
text: Inara stares straight ahead, relaxing her grip on the
text: controls. Mal is gone.
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: I told you to hang on.
speaker_heading: MAL (O.S. )
dialog: (in great pain)
dialog: I'm fine...
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - LATER
text: We are below Serenity as her bay doors are closing, six
text: little objects floating out of her belly like roe.
dialog: 4
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
text: These objects are roughly the size of pony-kegs, and clearly
text: home-made, parts welded together almost haphazardly. They
text: all spark silently to life -- and shoot off in six different
text: directions, as Serenity herself fires up her Firefly effect
dialog: and burns away from us.
scene_heading: INT. COMPANION TRAINING HOUSE - DAY
text: The Operative sips tea and rubs his temple.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: (into a com)
dialog: Forget the pulse beacon, there has
dialog: to be another way to track the
text: ship -- get a read on the nav sat.
dialog: It's a registered transport, you
dialog: must be able to locate --
speaker_heading: ENSIGN (O.S.)
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: Have you found a nav sat
dialog: trajectory?
speaker_heading: ENSIGN (O.S.)
dialog: Sir... we've found seven.
text: The Operative looks more unhappy than angry.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Does he think this is a game?
scene_heading: EXT. CLASSROOM - DAY
text: The teacher and students sleep as River -- as we saw her in
text: the institute, older, with blood seeping from the needle-
text: holes in her head -- makes her way through them.
text: Slowly she walks to the floating lecture screen. On it is
text: the solar system, glowing lines connecting all the stars and
text: planets. She becomes wide-eyed, breathing hard as it pushes
dialog: in to one system, one planet...
text: She looks over to one side of the tent, and we see:
scene_heading: INT. LAB - CONTINUING
text: Her POV is of the lab. There stand some five older men in
text: formal dress. They stare at her, impassive.
text: We see flashes of corpses, lying in houses, in city
text: streets -- and a Reaver's screaming face --
dialog: .00
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE LOCKER - DAY
text: And River awakens. A moment to get her bearings, then her
text: eyes narrow with intent.
speaker_heading: INARA (V.0.)
dialog: We have every reason to be afraid.
scene_heading: INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal?
dialog: That ain't so hard --
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: He didn't beat me up --
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: Because he's a believer.
scene_heading: INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP, A DARK CABIN
text: As Inara continues, we see: Fanty and Mingo, tied to chairs.
text: Light spills onto their bruised faces as the Operative enters.
speaker_heading: INARA (V.0.)
dialog: He's intelligent, methodical and
dialog: devout in his belief that killing
dialog: River is the right thing to do.
scene_heading: INT. PASSENGER DORM - CONTINUING
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: I honestly think the only reason
dialog: we haven't been blown out of the
text: air is that he needs to see her.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Needs to see her why?
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: I'm uncertain. I would say to be
dialog: sure of the kill, but... I just
dialog: know he'll kill us all to get to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: So no hope of a reward, huh?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Did he mention a deal of any kind?
speaker_heading: IWO
dialog:

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: (looking at Simon)
dialog: Give the two of them up. Go my
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: Which you was all ready to do not
dialog: a day ago. What went sour?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Cutting them loose ain't the same
text: as handing them over.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: That so? 'Cause the corpse I'm
text: about to become is having trouble
dialog: telling the difference.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (to Inara)
dialog: Did he say anything about a
dialog: "Miranda"?
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Don't know who or what, but it's
dialog: on River's mind. Conjure it might
dialog: be the reason he's after her.
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: You think maybe it poses some kind
dialog: of threat to the Alliance?
speaker_heading: WASH
dialog: Do we care? Are we caring about
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: You dumbass hogs, the only people
dialog: she's a threat to is us on this
dialog: boat!
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE LOCKER - CONTINUING
text: River is near the ceiling, keeping herself up in a split
text: again, feet against the walls. There is a wire mesh cover to

speaker_heading: MAL

dialog: Well you can't!
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: Do a damn sight better job'n you.
dialog: Getting us lashed over a couple of
dialog: strays...
dialog: (to Simon)
dialog: No offense, Doc, I think it's
dialog: noble as a grape the way you look
dialog: to River, but she ain't my sister
dialog: (to Mal)
dialog: and she ain't your crew. Oh, and
dialog: neither is she exactly helpless!
dialog: So where's it writ we gotta lay
dialog: down our lives for her, which is
dialog: what you've steered us toward.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: I didn't start this.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: No, the Alliance starts the war --

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Are you telling me that because
dialog: you think I don't know --
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: You came to the training house
text: looking for a fight.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: I came looking for you.
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: I just want to know who I'm

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: I start fighting a war I guarantee

speaker_heading: TO
text: Mal walks out into the cargo bay, Inara following, over:
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: We'll get off. River and I'll get

speaker_heading: (TURNING)
dialog: I got no answers for you, Inara.
dialog: I got no rudder. Wind blows
dialog: 40 northerly, I go north. That's who
dialog: I am. Maybe that ain't a man to

speaker_heading: INARA

speaker_heading: JAYNE

speaker_heading: JAYNE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: No trouble now, little crazy

scene_heading: INT. AFT HALL - MOMENTS LATER
text: The crew enters, drawn by the shots. Mal is first -- can't
text: open the door. Looks in to see an unconscious Jayne...
speaker_heading: MAL

speaker_heading: NO
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: It's gonna be oka --
text: She elbows his throat viciously. He drops to his knees,
text: shocked and gasping, as she spin-kicks him to the ground. He
text: doesn't move. She looks at him a moment, then takes off.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO BAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mal is throwing his shoulder against the bolted door to the
text: upstairs. He gives up, looking around.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: She's sealed off the bridge. I do
dialog: not like her there.
speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: Cap'n!
text: She tosses him a bolt remover. He starts pulling a bolt out
text: of a panel on the wall, tells Zoe:
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Check the shuttles. She coulda
dialog: 40 snuck in.
text: He pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires.
scene_heading: INT. FOREDECK HALL/BRIDGE - LATER
text: A floor panel hinges open, Mal pulling himself up. He moves
text: quietly to the bridge, gun drawn.
text: He enters to find River frantically punching up coordinates
text: on a big Cortex screen she's pulled out by the copilot's
text: seat. She whips Jayne's gun at his face, never looking at
text: him. A moment, and Mal lowers his own gun.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: The government's man, he says
dialog: you're a danger to us. Not worth
dialog: helping. Is he right? Are you
dialog: anything but a weapon? I've
dialog: staked my crew's life on the

speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: How can it be there's a whole
dialog: planet called Miranda and none of
dialog: us knowed that?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Because there isn't one. It's a
dialog: blackrock. Uninhabitable.
dialog: Terraforming didn't hold, or
dialog: somesuch. Few settlers died.
speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: (to Simon)
dialog: I had to show them. I didn't know

dialog: (hoarse whisper)
dialog: You could've asked...
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: (re: planet)
dialog: Wait a tick, yeah! Some ten years
dialog: back, before the war. There was
dialog: call for workers to settle on
dialog: Miranda, my daddy talked about
dialog: going. I should've recalled...
speaker_heading: WASH
dialog: But there's nothing about it on
dialog: the Cortex -- History,
dialog: Astronomy... it's not in there.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Half of writing history is hiding
dialog: the truth. There's something on

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Nobody -- ever -- calls me noble.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: But that's what's going to kill

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Zoe, you and Simon are gonna rope

speaker_heading: SIMON

speaker_heading: KAYLEE

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Kaylee, I need you to muck the

speaker_heading: KAYLEE

speaker_heading: INARA

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Sir. Do you really mean to turn

dialog: can make a suicidal attempt at
dialog: passing through Reaver space?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: I mean to live. I mean for us to
dialog: live. The Alliance won't have
dialog: that, so we go where they won't

speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: V0 God's balls, there's no way we're

dialog: There's a lot of fine ways to die.
dialog: I'm not waiting for the Alliance
dialog: to choose mine.
text: He walks through the group, toward the smashed cockpit of the

text: Mal shoots him in the head, turns back.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: I mean to confound those killers,
dialog: and take my shot at getting to

dialog: theme now. So I hear a word out
dialog: of any of you that ain't helping

speaker_heading: MAL

scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON THE BODIES as they BURN, flames passing over them

text: soundlessly in the nothing of space.
text: We arm past them to the windows of the bridge, looking in at
text: Mal, watching, with Zoe behind and Wash at the helm.
text: And we pull back out to see the whole of Serenity for the
text: first time: It is hardly recognizable. Charred corpses on
text: the nose, Cannon atop with a space-suited corpse draped
text: within, long scars, welded-on parts and war paint... the
text: trail of green light burns out with sporadic bursts of vapor.
text: It looks, for all the world, like a Reaver ship.

speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: Mal.

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Didn't see you.
speaker_heading: I NARA
dialog: I figured that.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Anything of use in there?
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: Maybe.
text: She puts it down and crosses to the bed. He sits by her.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: You don't have to stay in the

speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: You think anyone's set to sleep?
text: Simon's portioning out overdoses

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Cheerful fellow.

speaker_heading: INARA

scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. FOREDECK HALL/BRIDGE - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING
text: Reverse to see: an armada.
text: The black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a
text: vague cluster, as Serenity breaks frame headed toward them.
text: Most of them hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly
text: about. Some turn in gentle drifts, as though looking around.
scene_heading: Vd INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
text: They all wait, tensed up, as they approach the armada...
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING
text: And arrive, moving slowly through the ranks of ships.
text: Serenity passes a large, bizarrely shaped ship. It turns, as
text: though watching her. But lets her pass.
text: Another minute, and Serenity is through the Armada, headed
dialog: for the small planet just beyond.

speaker_heading: WASH

text: WIDER ANGLE: They're in a CITY. Gleaming metal, spread out

speaker_heading: ZOE

speaker_heading: JAYNE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: GAAAAaaoh God --
text: -- and steps back, horrified, as the others approach.
text: It's an office. About half the employees are there, in
text: chairs or on the ground, all in the same state as the first
text: fellow. We see ANGLES of the corpses as the gang evaluates...
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: How come they're preserved?
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Place must've gone hermetic when
dialog: the power blew. Sealed 'em.
speaker_heading: KAYLEE

speaker_heading: SIMON

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: There's gasses that kill painless,

speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: But they didn't fall down. None

speaker_heading: SIMON
text: More than anything, it looks like
dialog: starvation.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Anybody want to bet there's plenty
dialog: of food around?
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: They just lay down...
text: They notice River now, in the middle of the street, keening.
text: She drops to her knees, clutching her head.
dialog:

speaker_heading: RIVER

scene_heading: EXT. LANDING STRIP - DAY
dialog: It's small -- landing is easier in cities with flying
text: vehicles. At the end of a short runway, tipped and damaged,
text: is an Alliance Research Vessel. The gang makes its way
text: towards it.
scene_heading: INT. RESEARCH VESSEL - DAY
text: It's a mess, doors pried open, signs of violence but no
text: bodies. The gang walks through it, looking around.
text: River pulls away from Simon, suddenly determined. She
text: approaches a console, and a small cylindrical object. She
dialog: turns it slightly --
text: A hologram squawks to life amidst them all. First we see
text: images that resemble the flashes from River's mind: Corpses,
text: everywhere. We hear and then see DOCTOR CARON standing
dialog: exactly where she was when she recorded this message...
text: (As she speaks, we see angles of everyone watching, taking it

speaker_heading: CARON
dialog: -- just a few of the images we've
dialog: recorded, and you can see it
dialog: isn't.. it isn't what we thought.
dialog: There's been no war here, and no

dialog: (tearing up)
dialog: .well it works... it was
dialog: supposed to calm the population,
dialog: weed out aggression. Make a

dialog: here stopped fighting. And then
dialog: they stopped everything else.
dialog: They stopped going to work,
dialog: stopped breeding... talking...
dialog: eating...
dialog: (trying for control)
dialog: There's thirty million people here
dialog: and they all just let themselves
dialog: die. They didn't even kill
dialog: themselves. They just... most
dialog: starved. When they stopped
dialog: working the power grids, there
dialog: were overloads, fires -- people
dialog: burned to death sitting in their
text: V0 chairs. Just sitting.
text: There is a loud bang somewhere behind her -- she starts,
text: gathers herself.
speaker_heading: CARON
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: I have to be quick. There was no
dialog: one working the receptors when we
dialog: landed, so we hit pretty hard. We
dialog: can't leave. We can't take any of
dialog: the local transports because...
text: The bang again.
speaker_heading: CARON
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: There are people... they're not

text: She whirls, grabs a gun and fires -- then aims the gun at her
text: own head - but a Reaver is on her, knocks the gun away and
dialog: bites her face --
text: She screams continuously as the Reaver tops her, biting at
text: her and tearing at her clothes, at her skin.
speaker_heading: JAYNE
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: Turn it off.

scene_heading: EXT. RESEARCH VESSEL - CONTINUING

speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: This report is maybe twelve years
dialog: old. Parliament buried it, and it
dialog: stayed buried til River dug it up.
dialog: This is what they feared she knew.
dialog: And they were right to fear,
dialog: 'cause there's a universe of folk

dialog: sure as I know anything I know
dialog: this: They will try again. Maybe
dialog: on another world, maybe on this

speaker_heading: JAYNE

speaker_heading: MAL

speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Do we have a plan?
speaker_heading: MAL

dialog: for thirty worlds. He's pretty
dialog: damn close, too.
speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: Based on our orbital trajectories,
dialog: he reached optimum proximity just
dialog: before our sunset. If we make a

scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - CONTINUING
text: Serenity slips right under the Operative's ship and ducks and
text: weaves between dozens more. The Reaver force hits the
text: Alliance head on -- and several ships do just that, smashing
text: into bigger ships kamikaze-style, everything exploding --
text: The fleet mobilizes, blasting Reaver ships, circling around,
text: and an air war begins, a frenzied, balletic ecstasy of
text: destruction that the camera hurtles through as ships and
text: parts of ships fly at and past it.
speaker_heading: ANGLE: SERENITY
text: She nearly makes it all the way through the alliance fleet

scene_heading: INT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING
text: As the vessel shakes, clearly breached, The Operative moves

scene_heading: EXT. THE OPERATIVE'S SHIP - CONTINUING
text: The Dart disengages and bullets down towards the surface. As

scene_heading: EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING
text: She continues down, the metallic expanse of Mr Universe's

scene_heading: EXT. LANDING STRIP - CONTINUING
text: We can see it, a long strip, which halfway along becomes a

scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
text: Wash is fighting the stick with extreme concentration as Zoe
text: pulls out a seat as well, straps in.
scene_heading: INT. AFT HALL - CONTINUING

scene_heading: EXT./INT. LANDING STRIP/HANGER - CONTINUING
text: -40 And Serenity HITS the ground -- the landing gear folds and
text: snaps under the weight -- the ship keeps going, now inside
text: the hanger, heading towards the entrance to the facility,
text: slowing, fishtailing and coming about a full one eighty -- it
text: goes beyond the strip and crashes down into the pedestrian

scene_heading: EXT. LANDING STRIP - CONTINUING
text: We see the ship that has fired the harpoons as Reavers start
text: out of it. A second Reaver vessel enters frame from above,
text: about to land next to it.
scene_heading: EXT. SERENITY - MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: INT. BLACK ROOM/INNER HALL - MOMENTS LATER
text: A small double-sized doorway leads to the "Black Room", which

text: Mal hits a button and huge, thick, blast doors open from the
text: sides AND the top and bottom, creating the effect of a square
text: hole getting bigger. The hall itself is smaller than the

dialog: 40
text: Explodes, raining a bunch of equipment -- and part of a

text: In the black room, the door nearly buckles from the

dialog: back to Zoe)
dialog: Zoe... are you here?
text: She looks up at him.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Do the job, sir.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: You hold. Hold till I'm back.

speaker_heading: LOVEBOT
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Guy killed me, Mal. He killed me

dialog: I got... a short span here... they

dialog: a back-up unit... bottom of the

dialog: Hard to get to. I know they
dialog: missed it. They can't stop the

dialog: the signal.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Okay this is painful. On many

speaker_heading: A0
text: She turns back, powering down. Recording over.

scene_heading: INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING

speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: Oh, I didn't plan on going out
dialog: like this. I think we did right,
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: I never planned... anything. I

speaker_heading: SIMON
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: I mean to say.
text: Kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more precision than

speaker_heading: KAYLEE
dialog: Hell with this. I'm gonna live.
text: Simon looks at her a moment, then turns his attention to the

scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING
text: Mal has reached it and surveys the situation.
text: Before him is a railing, and he can look down on the
text: generator shaft. It's miles deep, with machines rotating and
text: grinding, and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it.
text: On the other side is a platform, with the broadwave console
text: sitting behind a clear plastic partition. Cables and chains
text: run along the ceiling, around a series of ladder rungs.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Hard to get to. That's a fact.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING
dialog: lwï¿½
text: The door is pried partially open -- enough for one Reaver to
dialog: squeeze through and charge.
text: Zoe stands up and shoots him in the head. He arcs back hard
text: as the second comes, Zoe shoots him, calmly walking toward
dialog: the door --
speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: Zoe... Gorramnit...
text: But she is in a trance, and we see beneath the calm, to the
text: bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing, single shots,
text: each one a kill, till five men down and she's out of ammo.
text: The sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks, the
text: precision of military training still in her as she flips him,
text: wresting the blade free and swinging it down out of frame,
text: bringing it up bloody, swinging again as the door bursts open
text: and she's rushed from behind ---
text: But Jayne totes an automatic, sprays killing fire on the lot,

speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: ZOE! Get yer ass back in the line!
text: voï¿½ She looks up, almost confused -- and one of Jayne's targets
text: comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a
text: blade, she screams as he cuts deep -- and an arrow lodges in
text: his neck.
text: Inara pulls up a fresh arrow, shaking only slightly.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - LATER
text: Mal is on the railing, reaching for the 'rungs' on the
text: ceiling just above him. He can almost get them -- one wrong
text: move and he pitches into the jaws of death...
text: A laser shot nails him in the lower back -- he arches, legs
text: sliding off the rail -- he falls and hits the rail with the
text: backs of his legs, flipping painfully onto his face as he
text: falls, mercifully, back onto the platform.
text: The Operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot
text: as Mal gets shakily up.

dialog: (in pain)
dialog: Shot me in the back. I haven't...

speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: There's a lot of innocent people
text: in the air being killed right now.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: You have no idea how true that is.
text: There's no wise-ass attitude in him now. They stand, facing
text: off at ten paces.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: I know the secret now. The truth
dialog: that burned up River Tam's brain
dialog: and set you after her. And the
dialog: rest of the 'verse is gonna know

dialog: I am.
text: The Operative raises his gun -- but Mal is the quickdraw

text: two hits to the chest (armored) before he makes it to cover.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Of course, that ain't exactly plan
dialog: A..
text: He drops out his cartridge and slams another in.
text: The Operative hides behind some machinery. Tries to peek out
text: at Mal -- and more shots send him scrambling back to cover.
text: Mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him, starts
text: going hand over hand to the island, moving as fast as he can.
text: The Operative sees his moment, dives for his gun -- but it's
text: been ruined by Mal's shot. He looks over at Mal with death
text: in his eyes. He runs at the railing, vaults off it, and
text: grabs a chain -- it snaps and he swings, grabbing another.
text: He reaches Mal and double kicks him from behind -- Mal flies
text: 4 off the rung but grabs a chain -- he tries to kick at the
text: Operative, but the guy is frikkin' Tarzan, he climbs up and
text: pulls a lever releasing one end of Mal's chain -- Mal goes
text: swinging, smacks into the wall six feet below the platform.
text: He scrambles up just as the Operative swings himself toward
text: the platform from above.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK ROOM/INNER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING
text: Jayne is still firing continuously as he drags Zoe back to

text: shirt, checks the wound.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Spine's intact --
speaker_heading: ZOE

speaker_heading: JAYNE
dialog: Oh, now you're likin' guns, huh?
dialog: Cheaters!
text: He takes a hit in the shoulder, grimaces and keeps firing.
text: River watches, the gun limp in her hand. Kaylee grabs it and
text: starts another round -- but she's peppered with dart-like
text: projectiles. She screams and drops the weapon, pulling the
text: projectiles from her -- Inara helps her up, pulls her back as
dialog: Zoe shouts:
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Everybody fall back! Fall back!
text: Everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor.

speaker_heading: ZOE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)

text: and SHKOWW!, the bullet takes him in the belly -- everything
text: suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly, one foot
text: lifted, a confused expression on his face -- then speeding
text: right back up as he slams down on his back, gasping for air.
text: River's mouth opens in a scream she doesn't make.
text: Blood spreads from Simon's belly. Inara rushes to him, grabs
text: cloth and puts pressure on the wound, puts Simon's hand on it.
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: Keep pressure here...
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: My bag. Need... adrenaline... and

text: She's running so fast, nobody has time to react til she DIVES

text: the scream following us back into the Black Room where River
text: lands in a perfect roll, comes up in a room full of Reavers.
text: Without a moment's hesitation she makes it to the panel, gets
text: the doors closing. She dodges a blade, but a blow to,the
text: back of the head shakes her. She weaves around a couple of

text: Mal gets up the chain to the platform. The Operative is on

dialog: here or Mal would go over as well -- but he comes back with

text: They square off, Mal stumbling back into a tool chest,
text: knocking over tools and computer parts.
text: The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword
text: gracefully from the holster under his jacket.
text: Mal produces his weapon: a tiny screwdriver.
text: He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him, gets
text: inside sword range and tries for the neck with the

text: staggering force.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Iwo Well, I'm known for that.
text: The Operative drops the blade, mouth open, stumbling back,
text: unable to make a sound.
text: Mal spins him, grabbing both his arms and working his own
text: through them in a twisted full nelson -- then bringing his
text: arms up suddenly, the Operative's mouth going wider as we
text: hear his arms crack.
text: Mal drops him sitting against the railing, picks up his
dialog: sword, saying:
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
text: Piece a shrapnel tore up that
dialog: nerve cluster my first tour. Had
dialog: it moved.
text: He squats down, looks the Operative in the face.

speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Sorry 'bout the throat. Expect
dialog: you'd wanna say your famous last
dialog: MW words now. Just one trouble.
text: He reaches over the railing, pulls the back of the
text: Operative's jacket through and shoves the sword through the
text: fabric, pinning the Operative in his sitting position.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: I ain't gonna kill you.
text: He moves to the console, starts prepping it.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: Hell, I'm gonna grant your
dialog: greatest wish.
text: He inserts the cylinder, turns it slightly. It hums to life.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: I'm gonna show you a world without
dialog: sin.
text: He hits "send all". The cylinder lights up and the broadcast
text: V0 begins. Here it is projected as a two-dimensional image on
text: the clear plastic partition, right in front of the Operative.
text: There are images first of the city -- of bodies, on the
text: street, in homes and offices... image after image, jus.t as
text: we saw on the research vessel -- and in River's mind.
speaker_heading: CARON (V.0.)
dialog: These are some of the first sites
dialog: we scouted on Miranda. There is
dialog: no one living on this planet.
dialog: There is no one...
text: Mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other
text: side. He begins to cross. Never even looks back.
text: On the Operative, trapped, watching in growing horror...
scene_heading: INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING
text: CLOSE ON: A Reaver in EXTREME SLOW MOTION. Face full of
text: fury, he is swinging his blade in a frenzy of hate.
text: And a small hand smashes that face so hard that teeth fly --
text: the Reaver clearing frame to reveal:
dialog: 4
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 119.
dialog: River.
text: She is bloodied, but not killed. She's as she was in the
dialog: bar -- moving faster and more efficiently than anyone can,
text: ducking and weaving and gutting and kicking and there are
text: piles of Reavers already, she never breaks concentration as
text: she uses their own blades against them, throws them, does
dialog: everything in her power to stay one step ahead of -- or
text: above -- the mob.
text: She slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors --
text: and a grappling hook punches through it, just missing her.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING
text: The Operative watches the end of the broadcast. We are on
text: his face through the clear plastic, so the images projected
text: on it blur right before him: the Reaver, Dr. Caron -- and her
text: screaming doesn't stop til something is shoved in her mouth.
scene_heading: INT. INNER HALL - CONTINUING
text: The gang is still trying to patch themselves together when
text: the elevator doors open. Mal staggers out, holding his
text: bleeding side.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: 140 MAL
dialog: It's done. Report?
text: Zoe looks at the badly wounded Simon, is about to give a
text: report -- and the doors start to open behind her.
text: Everyone turns to look, those who can feebly raising weapons,
text: as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to
text: reveal River, standing alone. She is holding two Reaver
text: blades, is bloody but unbowed. And the only one alive.
text: We hold on her a moment, then the wall behind her is ripped
text: completely away.
text: Behind it, grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the
text: wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen Alliance
text: soldiers, who line up, rifles trained on our gang...
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Drop your weapons! Drop 'em now!
scene_heading: ANOTHER SOLDIER

text: Mal and the others tense up. River turns slowly to face the
text: soldiers, blades still gripped... A soldier levels his gun at
text: her, sweaty and frantic... others still shouting...
scene_heading: vp INT. BASEMENT, OVER THE GENERATOR - CONTINUING
text: The Operative sits in silence, the voices coming over his com:
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (O.S.)
dialog: Targets are acquired! Do we have
dialog: a kill order? Do we have an order?
scene_heading: INT. BLACK ROOM - CONTINUING
text: CLOSE ON: THE SOLDIER'S FINGER, SQUEEZING THE TRIGGER...
speaker_heading: BLACK OUT.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT PLANET - SUNSET
text: We are close on a gravestone. It is rounded, looks more like
text: a bell than a headstone. It is topped by a jar built'into
text: the stone. The jar is weathered tin at top and bottom, but
text: glass in the middle. Inside the glass we can see one of
text: those slightly moving photos. It is of Mr Universe and his
text: lovebot, and the name Mr Universe is carved roughly in the
text: stone beneath.
text: The camera moves to the right and we see another such stone,
dialog: 40 this one bearing the image and inscription: Shepherd Derrial
dialog: Book.
dialog: The third is Hoban Washburne. Wash.
text: The camera continues moving right, but the next stone houses
text: a small home-made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it
text: instead of a picture-jar. And fixing another slip of paper
dialog: to it is River.
text: She moves away from the stone as Mal does likewise. They're
text: flanked by the crew: Jayne, Inara (to whom Mal moves),
text: Simon, who stands holding River before him and hand in hand
text: with Kaylee. He has a crutch supporting his other side.
text: There is a moment, then they all move aside, saying nothing.
text: Between them walks Zoe, in a simple white funeral gown,
text: holding a burning taper.
text: She stands at the stones a moment, then holds the taper to
text: the rocket fuse. Stands back with the others.
text: The rocket shoots up into the darkening sky. They all watch
text: its sputtering tail a moment, then it it explodes in a series
dialog: of fireworks.
dialog: 40
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 121.
text: WIDE ON the group, as the fireworks go off over their heads.
text: We are close on another explosion when it becomes:
text: CLOSE ON: A BLOWTORCH spitting sparks. Widen to see:
scene_heading: EXT. REPAIR YARD/SERENITY - DAY
text: Zoe is harnessed to the nose of the ship, welding on a
text: replacement for the very window the harpoon that impaled Wash
dialog: came through.
scene_heading: INT. DUCT INSIDE SERENITY - DAY
text: We are close on River as she works inside a crawlspace just
text: above the engine room, replacing wires. Some of them run to
text: a computer screen that she checks and adjusts.
scene_heading: EXT. REPAIR YARD/TOP OF SERENITY - DAY
text: Mal and Jayne hold onto the cannon as a crane is lifting it
text: off the top of the ship.
text: Close on Mal as he watches it go...
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE:
scene_heading: EXT. REPAIR YARD - CONTINUING
text: t f o And here we see the whole ship for the first time, harnessed
text: by the wings above the ground so she can be worked on all
text: over. The cannon is being hoisted away from her as a crew of
text: repairmen wheel new landing gear under her belly.
scene_heading: INT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY
text: Kaylee, deeply greasy, tweaks a part on the engine and
text: crosses to the back where Simon, shirtless and not entirely
text: ungreasy himself, is wrenching a bolt into place above his
text: head. A moment looking at him and she can't help herself -
text: she slides her arms around his chest...
scene_heading: EXT. SERENITY - DAY
text: On a scaffold, Inara repaints the name on the nose with
text: elegant precision.
scene_heading: INT. ENGINE ROOM - DAY
text: Kaylee and Simon are just making out like fiends, work
text: completely forgotten. With nothing resembling elegant
text: precision, they sink out of frame to the floor.

text: A beat, and River's head appears from the crawlspace above,
text: looking down at them with detached curiosity.
scene_heading: EXT. REPAIR YARD/SERENITY - DAY
text: It's raining as Mal is hauling in the last of the repair
text: equipment. The camera moves around him, skirting the ground
text: of the junkyard, till it lands on a figure in foreground,
text: standing watching him from some twenty feet away.
text: Mal stops, doesn't turn. Hand near his gun.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: If you're here to tell me we ain't
dialog: finished... then we will be real
dialog: quick.
text: The Operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the
text: ship, framed by the rain behind.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: Do you know what an uproar you've
dialog: caused? Protests, riots -- cries
dialog: for a recall of the entire
dialog: Parliament.
speaker_heading: MAL
speaker_heading: (TURNING)
dialog: We've seen the broadwaves.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: You must be pleased.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: 'Verse wakes up a spell. Won't be
dialog: long 'fore she rolls right over
dialog: and falls back asleep. Taint my
dialog: worry.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: I can't guarantee they won't come
dialog: after you. The Parliament. They
dialog: have a hundred men like me and
dialog: they are not forgiving.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: That don't bode especially well
dialog: for you... giving the order to let
dialog: us go, patching up our hurt...
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: I told them the Tams were no
dialog: longer a threat -- damage done.

speaker_heading: W MAL
dialog: They take you down, I don't expect
dialog: to grieve overmuch. Like to kill
dialog: you myself, I see you again.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
dialog: You won't. There is...
dialog: (small, grim smile)
dialog: .nothing left to see.
text: Mal looks at him a moment, then picks up his gear to head
text: inside. The Operative starts away into the rain, then stops
text: to look up at the nose of the ship.
text: ANGLE: the newly painted Serenity, standing tall in the rain.
speaker_heading: THE OPERATIVE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: "Serenity". You lost everything
dialog: in that battle. Everything you
dialog: had, everything you were... how
dialog: did you go on?
text: Mal hits the button to close the inner doors, steps inside as
text: they slide together. Glances at the Operative, unimpressed.
speaker_heading: VAO
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: You still standing there when the
dialog: engine starts, you never will
dialog: figure it out.
text: The Operative watches the door shut. A moment, and he goes.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUING
text: Mal stows the gear as Zoe approaches.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: What a whiner...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Sir, we have a green light.

speaker_heading: VW
text: A beat between them before:
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Make sure everything's secure.
dialog: Could be bumpy.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Always is.
text: She takes off and Mal heads up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. FOREDECK HALL - CONTINUING
text: Mal comes in and runs into Inara. Jayne passes through as
text: they talk, heading down into his bunk. Pays them no mind.
text: Neither do Simon and Kaylee, in the dining room stowing
dialog: supplies.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: We're taking her out. Should be
dialog: about a day's ride to get you back
dialog: to your girls.
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: VW
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: (moving past her)
dialog: You ready to get off this heap and
dialog: back to a civilized life?
speaker_heading: INARA
dialog: I, uh...
dialog: (he stops)
dialog: I don't know.
text: He looks at her, a smile in his eyes.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Good answer.
text: He turns and heads into the bridge.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING

speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: That's the plan.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Think you can work out how to get
dialog: her in the --
text: She is flipping switches without even looking, as the ship
text: hums to life.
scene_heading: EXT. SERENITY - CONTINUING
text: Her engines fire up and tilt. She lifts gently off the
dialog: ground.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUING
text: Mal looks slightly, only slightly nonplussed.
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Okay, clearly some aptitude for
dialog: the... but it ain't all buttons
dialog: A0 and charts, .
dialog: You know what the first rule of
dialog: flying is? Well, I suppose you
dialog: do, since you already know what
dialog: I'm about to say.
speaker_heading: RIVER
dialog: I do. But I like to hear you say
dialog: it.
text: He looks out at the rain on his windows, at his screens,
text: taking her up as he says:
speaker_heading: MAL
dialog: Love. You can learn all the math
dialog: in the 'verse, but you take a boat
dialog: in the air you don't love, she'll
dialog: shake you off just as sure as the
dialog: turning of worlds. Love keeps her
dialog: in the air when she oughta fall
dialog: down, tells you she's hurting
dialog: 'fore she keens. Makes her a home.

scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - MOMENTS LATER
text: We are looking down on the stormclouds as Serenity bursts out
text: of them, comes at us, flared by the sun behind the planet as
text: she passes us, her Firefly effect lighting up, about to shoot
dialog: off into the heavens --
text: There is a spark and a piece of paneling pops off, whips at
text: camera, blacking out the frame.
