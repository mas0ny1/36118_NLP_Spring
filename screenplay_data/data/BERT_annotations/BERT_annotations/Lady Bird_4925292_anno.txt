speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (V.O.)
dialog: Do you think I look like I’m from

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Now they’re awake. Lady Bird stares at her re. Marion makes

speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: You are from Sacramento.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (re: making the bed)
dialog: You don’t have to do that.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Well it’s nice to make things neat
dialog: and clean.
text: Marion is making hospital corners. Lady Bird sits on the

speaker_heading: MARION (CONT’D)

dialog: came together and smiled
dialog: mysteriously.” You have been
text: listening to ‘The Grapes of Wrath’
dialog: by John Steinbeck. If you...
dialog: (pause)
text: Lady Bird ejects the tape, returns it to the case fromthe
text: public library. They are both crying.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (looking on the back)
dialog: Our college trip took 21 hours and
dialog: 5 minutes.
text: They laugh and then wipe their tears. It’s a nice moment -
text: they both had the same emotion. Lady Bird immediately starts
text: looking for a good song on the radio.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: (turning it off)
dialog: Hey, you know, let’s just
dialog: sit with what we heard?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (bristling)
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: We don’t need to be constantly
dialog: entertaining ourselves, do we?
text: Lady Bird stares out the window, now sullen. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I wish I could live through
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Aren’t you?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Nope. The only exciting thing about
dialog: 2002 is that it’s a palindrome.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Ok fine, yours is the worst life of
dialog: all, you win.
scene_heading: LADY BIRD MARION
dialog: Oh so now you’re mad? Because It’s just that you’re being
dialog: I wanted to listen to music? ridiculous, you have a

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I’m sorry I’m not perfect.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Nobody is asking you to be perfect!
dialog: Just considerate would do.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (really picking a fight)
dialog: I don’t even want to go to school
dialog: in this state anyway, I hate
dialog: California. I want to go to the

speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Your Dad and I will barely be able
dialog: to afford in-state tuition.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: There are loans, scholarships!
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Your brother, your very smart

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD

speaker_heading: MARION

dialog: That is not a career and they went
scene_heading: to BERKELEY .MARION
dialog: Your father’s company is laying people off right and left, did
dialog: you know that? No of course not because you don’t care about
dialog: anyone but yourself.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Immaculate Heart is already a
dialog: luxury.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Immaculate FART. You wanted that,
dialog: not me!
speaker_heading: MARION
text: Miguel saw someone knifed in front
dialog: of him at Sac High, is that what
dialog: you want? You’re telling me that
dialog: you want to see someone knifed
dialog: right in front of you?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: He barely saw that. I want to go
dialog: where culture is, like New York.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MARION LADY BIRD
dialog: How in the world did I raise Or at least Connecticut or
dialog: such a SNOB? New Hampshire. Where writers
dialog: live in the woods.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: You couldn’t get into those schools
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
speaker_heading: MOM!
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: You can’t even pass your driver’s
dialog: test.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Because you wouldn’t let me
dialog: practice enough!
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: The way you work, the way you don’t
dialog: work, you’re not even worth state
dialog: tuition, Christine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD MARION (CONT'D)
text: MY NAME IS LADY BIRD! Well actually, it’s not, and
dialog: it’s ridiculous. Your name
dialog: is Christine.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: CALL ME LADY BIRD LIKE YOU SAID YOU
speaker_heading: WOULD!
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: You should just go to City College,
dialog: with your work ethic. City College
dialog: and then to jail then back to City
dialog: College. Maybe you’d learn how to
dialog: pull yourself up and not expect
dialog: everyone to do everything for
dialog: you...
text: They slow for a stop light and Lady Bird dramatically opens
text: the door and rolls out of the car. Marion screams.
scene_heading: INT. IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY. DAY.

dialog: Her best friend.
dialog: 5 classrooms, 5 syllabi, 5 “beginning of senior year”
text: speeches from the teachers. A few teachers are nuns.
scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: There are the classics: St.

dialog: My favorite, Kierkegaard - wait
dialog: until you hear his love story - it
dialog: will make you swoon.
text: Back in the church, Lady Bird looks intently at an image of
text: Jesus. The priest gives his homily.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: We’re afraid we won’t get into the
dialog: college of our choice, we’re afraid
dialog: we won’t be loved, we won’t be
dialog: liked, we won’t succeed.
text: Everyone takes communion. Lady Bird approaches and crosses
dialog: her arms so she just gets a blessing, not real communion,
text: she’s not Catholic. Lady Bird watches the boys get communion.
text: It’s somehow sexy, opening their mouths to receive the wafer.
speaker_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN (V.O.)
dialog: Some of the students were disturbed
dialog: by your posters.
scene_heading: INT. VICE-PRINCIPAL SISTER SARAH-JOAN’S OFFICE. DAY.
text: Sister Sarah-Joan, in a traditional habit, holds up some of

scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: I think it’s a little upsetting...
text: Reveal of the poster: Lady Bird’s head on a bird body.
text: Another shows her Catholic-uniformed body with a bird head.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: It’s my tradition to run for

scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: That’s not what I’m worried about.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (worried)
dialog: This won’t mess with my
dialog: scholarship, will it?
scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: No, you’re okay there.
dialog: (trying to be helpful)
dialog: You have a performative streak, I
dialog: think.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I think that too.
scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: Maybe you’d enjoy theatre arts...
dialog: They are having auditions for the
dialog: fall musical.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Do we have that here?
scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: It’s a collaborative effort with
dialog: the men at Xavier.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: How am I a senior and not know we
dialog: have that?
scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: Perhaps you haven’t always been an
dialog: active part of this community.
scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: They do a fall musical and a spring
dialog: play and from what I hear it’s a
dialog: real blast.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: What I’d really like is to be on
dialog: Math Olympiad.
scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: But math isn’t something that you
dialog: are terribly strong in?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: That we know of YET.
text: CLOSE ON A LIST.
text: Sign ups for auditions for the fall musical. A hand reaches

scene_heading: JULIANNE “JULIE” PICKETT

speaker_heading: JULIE (0O.S.)

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: It’s not the same thing.
speaker_heading: JULIE

dialog: I’m not sure you’re right...
scene_heading: EXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Julie and Lady Bird walk through the “fancy” neighborhood,
text: “The Fabulous Forties.” They stop in front of this very
dialog: specific house - it is the Dream House: It is three stories
text: and blue, with white shutters and a big American Flag. It
dialog: looks like nothing bad would ever happen in this house.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I love this neighborhood.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Yeah, it’s so beautiful.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: If I lived here I would definitely
dialog: have my wedding in the backyard.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I’d have friends over all the time
dialog: to study and eat snacks. I’d be
text: like “MOM WE’RE TAKING THE SNACKS
text: UPSTAIRS TO THE TV ROOM.”
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I’d have my own bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING.
text: Julie and Lady Bird browse magazines in an empty checkout
text: aisle. A Checker calls out to them:
speaker_heading: CHECKER
dialog: I can’t stop you dicks from hanging
dialog: out here but quit wrinkling all the
dialog: magazines!
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: When I’m in this store, I’m not
dialog: your sister - I’m a customer,
dialog: Miguel! I’m always right!
text: This is Miguel. Lady Bird’s brother. 22, Latino, clearly
text: adopted. Julie watches him and his girlfriend, Shelly Yuhan,
dialog: 22, a Bagger:
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Ever since she moved in, your
text: brother and Shelly are becoming
dialog: the same person.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: No way.
text: Shelly and Miguel have the same asymmetrical hair-cut and
text: “interesting” piercings. Vaguely punk looking. Seem like
text: they’ re wearing black leather jackets even when they aren’t.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
dialog: Yeah, okay, maybe.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (re: magazine)
dialog: See, why I don’t look like that?
text: The girls look at a model in the magazine. She poses in
text: front of the New York City skyline.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Just once I’d like to have the
dialog: song “New York Groove” play and
dialog: feel like it really applies to
dialog: my life.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You’ve never even been to New York.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: That’s why I’m applying to New York
dialog: colleges - do you know if Sarah
dialog: Lawrence is actually IN the city?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Your parents would pay for that?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Scholarships, financial aid. I’1l
dialog: figure it out. My Mom thinks I
text: can’t get in but she is sorely
dialog: mistaken.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What about terrorism?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Don’t be a Republican.
speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: Yeah, gotta go back to just felt

text: Marion suddenly remembers she has something, she hand Luis a
dialog: small bag:
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Oh Luis this is for you! I got it
dialog: for the baby, I couldn’t resist it.
text: He pulls out a frilly pink dress for a toddler.
speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: She loves pink!
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Well, it’s really more for you and
dialog: Andrea than it is for the baby, and
dialog: I’m sorry I didn’t have time to
dialog: wrap it....
speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: No, it’s perfect.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: See you tomorrow... I mean, later?
text: Luis just laughs.
scene_heading: INT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. EARLY MORNING.
text: Marion drives back home. It is romantic somehow. She loves
dialog: these streets, loves the turns she knows so well. When she’s
text: not resenting the stuck-ness of her own life she has an
dialog: enormous capacity to love it. Remember this moment with
dialog: Marion.
scene_heading: EXT. LADY BIRD’S NEIGHBORHOOD. EARLY MORNING.
text: Marion drives up. Women are watering their lawns, getting the
text: paper, doing yard work, touching their flowers. Solidly

dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. MORNING.
text: Dad (50s, name: Larry) brushes his teeth. Marion perched on
text: the edge of the tub with a newspaper and a stack of mail,
text: going through it.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Did you know toothpaste is
dialog: basically ineffective? It’s like
text: sucking on a mint.
speaker_heading: MARION
text: (to Larry, shaking her
dialog: head)
dialog: Mike Kerry died. I didn’t know he
dialog: was sick again.
speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: MARION

text: Knocking at the door.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MARION (CONT’D)

dialog: Do you think that Shelly and Miguel
dialog: have sex on the pullout couch?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: Marion laughs at Larry’s subtle joke. He laughs at her
text: laughter. They like each other.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. MORNING.
text: Miguel and Shelly eat cereal. Larry reads the paper. Marion
text: makes Lady Bird’s breakfast and her lunch.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Why can’t I just make the eggs?
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Because you take too long and make
dialog: a big mess and then I have to clean
dialog: it up.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: (small voice)
dialog: Eggs aren’t good for the
dialog: environment, anyway.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (too loud)
speaker_heading: WHAT?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You heard her.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: (placing the eggs)
dialog: Here, eat quickly, PLEASE.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (re: paper)
dialog: Look at all these pictures. Every
text: newspaper looks like USA Today.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Shelly and I are trying to be
dialog: vegan. Hence the soy milk.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: You wear leather jackets.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: They’ re vintage. It doesn’t support
dialog: the industry.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (poking at the eggs)
dialog: They aren’t done, there’s white
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: You know how you love Brambles?
dialog: Pigs are smarter than him even.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I never thought Brambles was a
dialog: GENIUS okay?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
dialog: (very obnoxious)
dialog: MOM! The eggs are NOT DONE!
speaker_heading: MARION
text: FINE MAKE YOUR OWN FUCKING EGGS.
text: Marion then throws the frying pan violently in the sink and

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I WANTED TO YOU WON’T LET ME!
text: Lady Bird follows Marion out of the room.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: Your sister doesn’t like me.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (0O.S.)

speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: She does.
text: Shelly gets up, pouting. MIGUEL follows her
speaker_heading: MARION (0O.S.)
dialog: YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE!
dialog: GOING TO BED!
dialog: 14.
text: Larry is left alone. It’s weirdly peaceful for half a second.
scene_heading: 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. DAY.
text: Lady Bird and Larry on the way to school. She feverishly
text: changes the radio station, finds a song she likes:
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Did you know that Alanis Morisette

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I believe it.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: So I’m applying to a couple East

dialog: me with the financial aid
dialog: application but Mom can’t know.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: We... aren’t they quite
dialog: expensive?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: First, yes that’s why financial
dialog: aid. Second, I have to get in
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Mom won’t be happy about it.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Which is why I don’t want to fight
dialog: about it before I have to.
dialog: 15.
text: Lady Bird looks up. They are a couple of blocks from school.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
dialog: Just pull over here
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Are you sure, I can drive you to
dialog: the front --
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: No, just this is fine. I like to
dialog: walk.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okay, well, I love you.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Thanks, Uncle Matt.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Sweet!

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD

speaker_heading: JULIE

dialog: Bye, mom.
dialog: (watching Ms. Pickett go)
dialog: Your Mom really likes you.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Yeah. I just keep getting
dialog: fatter.
text: Lady Bird starts eating the Matt lunch and chucks her own

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: Me too. Matt is awesome.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Yeah, I hope he marries my Mom.
dialog: That would be nice. He promised me
dialog: his old car when I turn eighteen.
text: In the student parking lot, a girl gets out of her fancy
text: Range Rover. She’s pretty in a high school way.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: That car should be illegal. Jenna

text: She just goes to Pavillions.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I heard Jenna Walton has a tanning

text: The girl, Jenna Walton, is very tan. Identical tan girls

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: She is so pretty.
speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: We are so gross!
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I think I figured it out when I was
dialog: like three or something.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I use, I take off the shower head,
dialog: oh god this is so embarrassing! I
dialog: use that.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I don’t know if mine is the right

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Mine is pretty intense, I think.
text: Darlene, an odd looking girl, has silently walked in.
speaker_heading: DARLENE

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Me neither. I was the one who had a
text: dress and prepared a song.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I know!
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Now you're going to get romantic
text: with Danny on stage.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It’s probably my only shot at that,
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
text: She take the pen and crosses out Christine and writes LADY
text: BIRD. Leaves.
text: Julie stays and when she’s sure she’s alone she touches her
text: name - loving herself and the feeling of being chosen.
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING.
text: Marion grocery shops. Lady Bird looks at a BRIDE magazine.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Mom...
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: (re: the magazine)
dialog: We don’t need to buy that.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: It’s only three dollars. I’m having
dialog: a hard week.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: If you want to read it we can goto
dialog: the public library.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I want to read it in bed.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: That’s something rich people do.
dialog: We are not rich people.
text: Lady Bird walks away and then tucks the magazine underneath
text: her sweater into the top of her skirt, sneakily stealing it.
text: As she’s performing this maneuver, she sees DANNY (!) and his
text: Mom and three little brothers walk by. She walks up bravely:
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Come here often?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (not getting the joke)
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (extending her hand)
dialog: I’m Lady Bird, we’re going to be in
dialog: the musical together.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh, yeah, I remember you! You were
dialog: wearing that dress.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I just wanted to say what’s up and
dialog: I’ll see you in rehearsal.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Thanks, I’m super excited. You live
dialog: in the neighborhood?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (doing a voice)
dialog: Nah, I’m from the wrong side of the
dialog: tracks.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Is that your family? There are so
dialog: many of you!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Irish-Catholic! It’s hard to finda
dialog: girl to date that’s not my cousin.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Well, okay. You’re going to make a
dialog: great Franklin.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Thanks! I want my hair, his hair
dialog: to be curly, though.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Like Jim Morrison. Very ‘70s.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Like Jim Morrison exactly.
speaker_heading: DANNY’ S MOM
speaker_heading: DANNY !
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Gotta go!
text: Lady Bird walks back to Marion, who is with Miguel while he
text: scans their groceries and Shelly bags them.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Who is Jim Morrison again?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: He was in a rock band, moron, The
text: Doors.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I knew that.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: (looking at the bill
dialog: This is with your employee
dialog: discount?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Yeah, it’s already included.
text: Marion looks worried.
scene_heading: INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON.
text: Everyone tries to keep up with the dance steps Miss Patty
text: teaches them. She is also, apparently, the choreographer. She
dialog: can move amazingly well for a bigger woman.
dialog: 23.
text: They play theatre games and do acting exercises. Father
dialog: Leviatch is actually quite good at casting a spell and making
dialog: everyone feel included.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The priest, Father Leviatch, looks around the stage where
text: everyone sits, cross legged, tired from dancing.
speaker_heading: FATHER LEVIATCH
dialog: To get our emotions going, we’re
dialog: going to play “first one to cry
dialog: wins.”
speaker_heading: FATHER LEVIATCH
dialog: Starting ... Now. I’m playing too.
dialog: So is Miss Patty.
text: Miss Patty nods.
text: They all try to cry really hard. Suddenly everyone looks up
text: - Father Leviatch is sobbing.
text: Everyone is uncomfortable watching an adult man cry.
speaker_heading: FATHER LEVIATCH
dialog: I’m sorry.. I’m sorry.
scene_heading: EXT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON.
text: Diana, another girl in the play, dishes the gossip while she
text: and Lady Bird and Danny wait for their rides:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I heard that before he became a
dialog: priest he was married and he had a
dialog: son named Etienne who died of a
dialog: drug overdose at 17 which was maybe
dialog: a suicide but my mom says same
dialog: difference if you are so careless
dialog: with your life.
dialog: (a horn honks)
dialog: Oh that’s her! Gotta go, bye guys!
text: Lady Bird and Danny wave goodbye and then fall into a
text: semi- awkward silence. She sees it’s her Moment. She tries
text: to casually hand Danny a bag but it’s a kind of big bag.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Oh, I almost forgot. I brought you
dialog: these hot rollers. For your Jim
dialog: Morrison hair.
text: He pulls out the Conair pink and purple “Hot Sticks.”
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Thank you so much.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: You’ re welcome.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You’11 have to show me how to use
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (weirdly formal)
dialog: It would be my pleasure.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: They look like sperms.
text: He laughs and Lady Bird joins in. They do look like sperms
dialog: but it wasn’t so funny to say it.
speaker_heading: DANNY (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey! I just remembered I had a
dialog: dream about you!
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Really?! What happened?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We were flying to Disneyland on a
dialog: giant carrot....
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Awesome!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I love Disneyland.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Me too, I think it’s kind of scary
dialog: but I also love it.
dialog: Triumph! They are having a Real Conversation.
scene_heading: INT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY
text: Mr. Bruno explains a problem on a projector. He’s handsome
text: and young-ish. Definitely handsome for an all girls school.
text: Lady Bird zones out, thinking about Danny. Julie looks
text: intently at Mr. Bruno. She loves him, privately.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNO
dialog: (finishing an explanation)
dialog: Don’t leave me hanging. Can I get
dialog: a nod? That’s good. Maybe even a
dialog: verbal confirmation?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (too loud)
dialog: YES.
text: Julie experience her mini moment of private embarrassment.
text: They are handed back quizzes. Julie gets a A-.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNO
dialog: Good job, Jules, I could tell from
dialog: your work that you even understood
dialog: the one you missed!
text: He kind of winks at her. She blushes.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (looking at her grade)
scene_heading: SUCK A DICK.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (to Lady Bird)
dialog: I like “Jules.”
text: Lady Bird looks at her C+.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I just don’t get why I’m not good
dialog: at math, my Dad is really good at
dialog: math. Even Miguel has a math
dialog: degree.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Maybe it’s your Mom’s fault.
scene_heading: INT. HOMECOMING DANCE. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT.
text: There are a bunch of kids clumped, some dancing, some sitting
text: on half-hearted hay bales. The popular girls, Jenna etc.,
dialog: wear tank tops that say (front) Ditch the horse... (and back)
dialog: Ride the cowboy!
text: Lady Bird and Julie now have on bandanas and denim - they’ re
text: doing the Groucho Marx Duck Soup dance to “Tha Crossroads.”
text: Suddenly Lady Bird stops.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You lose! POINT JULIE!
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: No, look
dialog: 26.
text: Across the dance, there is Danny. He’s wearing chaps, a holster,
text: a hat, fake pistols. Like teenage John Wayne.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
dialog: Wish me luck.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Luck.
text: Julie watches as Lady Bird makes a bee-line for Danny.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Wanna dance?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hell, yeah!
text: They start slow dancing together. Julie does the duck-soup
text: dance alone and then stops. It’s pointless without a buddy.
text: She falls back and watches.
text: Sister Sarah-Joan walks by Lady Bird and Danny:
scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: Six inches for the Holy Spirit!
text: They roll their eyes: Rules! Once she leaves Danny pulls Lady
text: Bird close again. She swoons. Life is happening.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT.
text: Lady Bird, Julie and Danny wait outside of the dance, leaning
text: against the gym waiting for their parents. Julie’s Mom pulls
text: up with Uncle Matt. Honks.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (to Lady Bird)
dialog: That’s us!
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Nah, my Mom is coming.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No she’s not.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (pointed)
dialog: Yes, she is.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: But the plan was sleepover at -
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
speaker_heading: IT’S FINE.
dialog: 27.
text: Lady Bird is clearly trying to stay there with Danny.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Okay, bye then.
text: Julie gets in the front seat to practice driving. Leaves.
text: Lady Bird and Danny are quiet, listening to the muffled
text: sounds of the dance. Then:
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Have you ever been out of the
dialog: country?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: When I was little, my Dad had a job
dialog: that took him to Brazil. I remember
text: from the pictures.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I’ve never been out of the
dialog: country. It’s my dream to go
dialog: to Paris.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Paris.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That’s why I’m learning French.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: My mom said French wasn’t useful.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It is if you want to go to Paris.
text: They laugh.
speaker_heading: DANNY (CONT’D)
dialog: I still don’t know how to use those
dialog: rollers you gave me.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Oh, it’s so easy, like after they
dialog: heat up, you just take your hair
text: and twist the hair and then twirl
dialog: the thing like this...
text: She reaches up to his hair. He kisses her. It’s surprising.
text: They kiss again. It’s romantic, really romantic.
scene_heading: EXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. NIGHT.
text: Lady Bird walks home. She’s smiling so huge and throws her
text: face to the sky and screams.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Marion and Larry are arguing with a lot of financial
text: documents strewn across the kitchen table.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Larry how long will this hold us.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I don’t know...
text: Lady Bird opens the back door, glowing and shiny from the
text: night and the kiss. She sneaks past.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Well, someone must know. Can the
dialog: whole family go on Cobra, even
dialog: Miguel? What happens if someone
dialog: gets in an accident?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I’m not sure - the severance
dialog: package I think it expires all at
dialog: once, not within the calendar
dialog: year...
text: Lady Bird tip-toes into her room. She knows she wasn’t
text: supposed to see this. And she doesn’t want to know any more.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: I’ll ask at my work if --
text: Suddenly, a noise makes her turn her head sharply.
speaker_heading: MARION (CONT’D)
dialog: Is she home?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Maybe leave it for tonight...
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: No, she knows better.
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: She cannot sneak around like
dialog: this...
text: Marion barrels down the hallway towards Lady Bird’s room.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: Lady-Bird, under the covers, hears her Mom coming. Then all
text: the lights come on, it’s so bright:
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Christine! You can’t leave your
dialog: room like this!
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I didn’t...
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: None of these things were put
dialog: away right, they aren’t nice,
scene_heading: CHRISTINE! NOW!
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: My name is Lady Bird.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Don’t lie to me, Christine!
text: Lady Bird sees her Dad pass by the door and give her a look
dialog: like “I’m sorry, I can’t help you here.” He disappears.
text: Marion picks up her uniform.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: NO, this uniform is going to look
dialog: like TRASH on Monday!
speaker_heading: MARION (CONT’D)
dialog: This isn’t right - we can’t treat
dialog: our clothes like this. I don’t
dialog: know what your wealthy friends
dialog: do...
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Why do you care what I do tomy
dialog: clothes?
text: Marion closes the door..
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Your father does not have a job.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: He lost his job, okay? Do you
dialog: need him to come in here and
dialog: explain that to you?
dialog: Lady Bird
dialog: Lady Bird
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Of course he wouldn’t do it
dialog: anyway, he’s Mr. Nice Guy. I always
dialog: have to be the Bad Guy.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Can we please talk about this
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: You can’t look like a rag because
dialog: that makes us look like rags. And
dialog: you want to know the truth? Here’s
dialog: the truth: some of your friends’
dialog: fathers could employ your father
dialog: and they won’t do that if it looks
dialog: like his family is trash.
text: puts all her clothes away while Marion watches.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Didn’t you ever go to sleep without
dialog: putting all your clothes away
dialog: perfectly? Like even once? And
dialog: don’t you wish your Mom hadn’t
dialog: gotten angry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: My mother was an abusive alcoholic.
text: has nothing to say to this, Marion wins.
scene_heading: INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR’S OFFICE. DAY.
dialog: Lady Bird
text: looks at some brochures. The Guidance Counselor
text: looks at her grades and test scores.
scene_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: So I understand that you’re not
dialog: interested in any Catholic
dialog: colleges?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: No way. Sorry, but yes, no way.
dialog: 31.
scene_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: Then you’1l be applying to UCs and
dialog: State schools?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Yes, but also those East Coast
dialog: liberal arts schools. Like Yale,
dialog: but not Yale because I probably
dialog: couldn’t get in.
scene_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You definitely couldn’t get in.
dialog: Part of my job is to help yoube
dialog: realistic.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: That seems like everyone’s job.
scene_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: Your SAT scores are strangely very
dialog: good.
text: Lady Bird shrugs.
speaker_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR (CONT’D)
dialog: I’d placed some calls to local
dialog: alumni of the schools you’re
dialog: interested in, but unfortunately
text: all the interviews are taken.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: So... what does that mean?
scene_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: It means that you’ll have to get in
dialog: on how you look on paper.
scene_heading: INT. THEATRE. DAY.
text: The kids rehearse -- following dance moves and singing.
scene_heading: EXT. ROSE GARDEN. NIGHT.
text: Lady Bird and Danny lie on a blanket in the park, looking up

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Shouldn’t we go home?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: My Mom is always mad. It doesn’t
dialog: matter if I get home late, she’d be
dialog: mad at me anyway.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: 32.
dialog: Your Mom is hard on you.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: She loves me a lot.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Pick a star for us.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: That one, right there right next to

dialog: - see it?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: That’s our star.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: You know you can touch my boobs,

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I know... it’s just.... I respect
dialog: you too much for that.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Oh, cool, awesome. I totally get
dialog: that. Thank you.
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I love you, too.
text: They kiss and look back up at the stars.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Let’s name our star Claude.
text: Lady Bird makes a face.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: That’s pretentious, don’t you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It’s French.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What should we name it?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
speaker_heading: BRUCE.
text: They laugh and kiss and yell to the heavens.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I LOVE YOU!
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (not really to anyone)
dialog: It’s normal to not touch a penis.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (looks around, notices
dialog: everyone is gone)
dialog: I have to go to class.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: But I have free period!
speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Bye, love you.

speaker_heading: MARION

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (silence)
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Well, I just couldn’t tell.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Why didn’t you just say “Pick up
dialog: your feet.”
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: I didn’t know if you were tired.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: You were being passive aggressive!
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: No. I wasn’t.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD

speaker_heading: MARION

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD

scene_heading: INT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY.
text: Mr. Bruno addresses his class:
dialog: MR. Bruno
dialog: So because my gradebook has

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You’ re welcome. No, thank you.

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Hey, I think B.
dialog: MR. Bruno
dialog: I thought it was more like B- maybe
dialog: even C+ territory.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: No, because I did really well on

dialog: 38.
dialog: MR. Bruno
dialog: I seem to remember you doing only

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: Is my name.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It’s funny, on my way here, I went
dialog: over the train tracks --
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: You took H street?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Right, and so just Lady Bird always
dialog: says that she lives on the wrong

dialog: thought that it was, like, a

speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: house? Oh my god.
text: She meets his Grandmother, almost kisses her hand like she’s
text: a queen but pulls back just in time:
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Your house is my favorite in all
dialog: of East Sacramento.
text: Lady Bird and Danny walk through the house. She spots very
dialog: prominent Ronald Regan poster:
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
dialog: Is this... a joke?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No.
text: Lady Bird meets people, so many people, and in a lull, folds
text: a napkin in a cool way - it looks like a four-pointed flower.
text: Danny’s Grandmother notices, and IS TOTALLY INTO IT. Soon,
text: Lady Bird is folding all the napkins at the tables this way,
text: teaches her how to do it, too. It is clear how much Danny’s
dialog: Grandmother enjoys Lady Bird.
scene_heading: INT. DANNY’S CAR. NIGHT
text: Lady Bird and Danny are singing along with songs from the
text: show. Pick up Julie from her apartment complex. Pick up Greg
text: from his house. Now they’re all singing.
text: In the car, they change out of their Thanksgiving “finery”
dialog: and put on what they consider to be “people who listen to
text: music in coffee shop” outfits. That was what the duffel was
text: for, the costume change. There are scarves and a beret.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. NIGHT.
text: In their new outfits, Greg and Danny and Julie and Lady Bird
text: smoke a out of a bowl, which another one of them lights.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: How do you know when it’s working?
dialog: 41.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You’11 know.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: It’s not working.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: It’s not? My sister said this was
dialog: premium.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I’m working.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I’m working too.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Nope.
text: They are quiet for a second.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
dialog: I can’t feel my arms.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You’ re working.
text: They laugh really hard. Danny makes out with Lady Bird.
scene_heading: INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. NIGHT.
text: They hazily take stock of everything. There are some ironic
text: turkeys pinned up on the stage.
text: The “cool kids” are there. They don’t say hi but they don’t
text: shun them. Jenna Walton is there with her boyfriend, Jonah
text: Ruiz. He’s singing pretty terrible songs about her with his
text: band, the pretentiously named L’enfance Nue.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (whispered to Julie)
dialog: If Danny and I get married and then
dialog: his Grandma died, I’d inherit the
dialog: Dream House.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Wouldn’t his parent’s get it?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh yeah, we’d have to kill them.
dialog: And kill his older brothers, too.
dialog: 43.
text: Kyle Scheible, a long-haired beautiful bassist, is really
text: into it. Lady Bird spends an extra-long time looking at this
text: Kyle Scheible. She feels DEEPLY ATTRACTED to him. She looks
dialog: at Danny, she loves him, yes, but there is something else
text: going on with Kyle Scheible. She’s not sure, maybe it’s the
text: pot. Maybe not. REMEMBER KYLE, Lady Bird will.
text: Meanwhile, Mr. Bruno is there - weird. He looks at Julie, who
text: was looking at him. She turns quickly away.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (to no one)
dialog: Where is Mr. Bruno’s wife...?
scene_heading: INT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Lady Bird and Danny stand by the microwave, making “Smart
text: Ones” frozen dinners. Six of them. Greg and Julie also eat,
text: everyone with their own spoon taking bites out of the
text: different platters.
text: Then Marion walks in - they are still giggling, she awkwardly
dialog: announces herself:
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: How’s it going?
text: No one can say anything, it’s almost like they’re frozen.
text: Finally Lady Bird is able to squeak out:
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Mom, we really can’t talk right now.
text: They all dissolve into giggles again.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Well, Happy Thanksgiving. We missed
dialog: you, Lady Bird.
text: Marion leaves. She’s hurt and angry but mostly hurt.
scene_heading: EXT. LADY BIRD’S FRONT YARD. NIGHT
text: The kids all pile back into Danny’s car. Lady Bird waves
text: goodbye, all of them laughing. Then they are gone. Lady Bird
text: shivers a little, now alone. Startles when she sees Shelly
dialog: smoking:
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (curious)
dialog: Why does that cigarette look so
dialog: weird? Like not like cigarette?
dialog: 44,
text: Shelly offers her a drag. Lady Bird drags and coughs.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: It’s a clove. Lick your lips.
dialog: That’s why they’re sweet.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Your Mom was really sad you weren’t
dialog: here tonight for Thanksgiving.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Well, she hates me.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: She has a big heart, your Mom. She
dialog: took me in after my parents freaked
dialog: out about, whatever, pre-marital
dialog: sex. I admire her.
text: Lady Bird doesn’t fight Shelly.
scene_heading: INT. XAVIER. GIRLS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING.
text: Buzzing in the girls dressing room. It’s opening night!
text: They are putting up pictures and do-dads. They are exchanging
text: “opening night” gifts. The girls are applying too much
text: makeup. There is music playing and lots of screaming.
scene_heading: INT. XAVIER. BOYS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING.
text: The boys also get ready. They are putting on powder and
text: combing their hair. It’s less loud, but also kinetic.
scene_heading: INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. EARLY
scene_heading: EVENING.
text: All the boys and girls are gathered in a circle. Father
text: Leviatch and Miss Patty are leading the prayer.
speaker_heading: FATHER LEVIATCH
scene_heading: SAINT IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA...
speaker_heading: EVERYONE

dialog: PRAY FOR US!
speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
speaker_heading: FOREVER!
text: They break and cheer. It’s time for the show.
scene_heading: INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT.
text: The show is about to begin. The audience sits in the dark.
text: The students in the wings. The paltry orchestra strikes up
text: the first chord.
text: MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG is actually a pretty upsetting and
text: adult show. Julie sings a song about divorce. The other
text: “fabulous” girl, Diana, plays a character who has an affair.
text: There’s lots of pretend drinking of alcohol. They dance and
dialog: sing their hearts out
text: Everyone cheers at the end, but more about the fact of the
dialog: show as opposed to the show itself.
text: The audience includes the whole of Lady Bird’s family,
dialog: Julie’s Mom and Uncle Matt, Danny’s whole Irish-Catholic
dialog: clan. Everyone is proud.
scene_heading: INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT.
text: Mingling after the show. Some of the administrators look
text: scandalized.
text: Julie sees Mr. Bruno and approaches him, feeling beautiful
dialog: and confident:
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNO
dialog: There she is! Jules, wow! You were
dialog: so good. I couldn’t believe that.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Thank you...
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNO
dialog: Jules, I’d like you to meet my
dialog: wife, Becky. Becky this is Jules,
dialog: one of my brightest students.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (devastated)
dialog: Nice to meet you, too.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNO
dialog: How we doing?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Yeah, I’m a little tired.
speaker_heading: MR. BRUNO
dialog: Okay, I gotta get her home, we’ve
dialog: got the little one, but great
dialog: work Jules.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (as they leave)
dialog: Congratulations.
text: Julie is humiliated, and doesn’t quite know why. She sits
text: down next to Father Leviatch, who also looks traumatized. He
text: watches people pass him by:
speaker_heading: FATHER LEVIATCH
dialog: They didn’t understand it
scene_heading: INT. DINER. NIGHT.
text: The entire cast and crew is there, enjoying their opening
text: night, eating a lot of chicken fingers and french fries. They
text: are being silly and playing a Broadway trivia game. Lady Bird
text: and Danny make towers with the sugar packets. Julie and Greg
text: hang out together: they’re both the “extra” friends. Everyone
text: is giddy and happy.
scene_heading: INT. DINER GIRLS BATHROOM. NIGHT.
text: Julie and Lady Bird wait for the stalls to open up.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
text: HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU ALL WILL
dialog: BE I DRANK SO MUCH SODA!
speaker_heading: STALL WOMAN (0.S.)
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: CHORUS MEMBER (0O.S.)
dialog: I just got my period!
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Goddamn it!
text: Lady Bird leaves.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Where are you going?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: There’s never a line in the men’s
dialog: room!
scene_heading: INT. MEN’S ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Lady Bird opens the door and opens a stall and there, in
text: front of her: Danny and Greg making out hard. Julie comes
text: tumbling in from behind.
scene_heading: INT. JULIE’S ROOM. JULIE’S HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: They both cry. They listen to “Crash Into Me” by Dave
text: Matthews and sob.
text: The song ends and Lady Bird starts it over.
scene_heading: INT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT.
text: They perform the next night.
dialog: No fun. It’s no fun because their boyfriends are gay.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE. DAY.
text: Lady Bird gets her cast off with a saw. Marion watches.
text: The doctor throws the cast in the trash. She is mournful.
scene_heading: INT. ST. FRANCIS. DAY.
text: Finals. Lady Bird casually cheats off the girl sitting next
dialog: to her.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. CHRISTMAS DAY.
text: Everyone gets socks and underwear for Christmas. Even Shelly.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: They’ re really nice socks.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: They’ re expensive, actually. They
dialog: wick moisture away from your feet.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: Yeah my feet always have moisture.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Mom, I love them.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: I’m sorry it’s Small Christmas. We
dialog: wanted to, well, it’s just a little
dialog: small this year.
text: Larry opens his gift.
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: It’s just what I needed, honey.
text: He holds up a throw pillow that says “Golfers Don’t Diet They
text: Just Exist On Greens.” He laughs.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: (laughing, too)
dialog: It makes me laugh.
scene_heading: INT. LADY BIRD’S ROOM. NIGHT.
text: A gentle knock on the door.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (0O.S.)
dialog: Dad? Come in.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (entering)
dialog: How did you know it was me?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
text: Mom doesn’t knock.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No, she doesn’t.
text: He gives her an envelope. Quietly says:
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT’D)
dialog: Here they are, your completed
dialog: financial aid applications. Merry
dialog: Christmas.
text: Lady Bird throws her arms around Larry.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Thank you! Thank you!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Do you need money for the
dialog: applications? Because I can help
dialog: with that, too, I just need to --
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: -- no, no, I’ve got that, summer
dialog: jobs covered it.
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUEL’S ROOM. COMPUTER. DAY.
text: Lady Bird frantically fills out her applications: addresses
text: things, puts materials in envelopes.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: This is why we have computer shut-
dialog: off time - this is our room.
text: He indicates Shelly, looking forlorn by the pullout sofa-bed.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Okay, okay, just can you drive me
dialog: to the post office on J? It
dialog: should still be open.
scene_heading: EXT. POST OFFICE. NIGHT.
text: They are just closing up for the night. Lady Bird runs up and
text: posts them at the last minute.
scene_heading: EXT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. PORCH. MIDNIGHT.
text: Lady Bird and her family are out celebrating New Years. Noise
dialog: makers and sparklers. Happy 2003! Everyone wears the glasses
dialog: with the zeros for the eyes.
scene_heading: INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON.
dialog: This is where she got high the first time and the band played
text: - now Lady Bird learns the cash-register, espresso machine,
text: and then sees Kyle Scheible, that amazing looking bassist,
text: sitting at a table outside, plowing through “The People’s
dialog: History of the United States.”
text: Later, he steps outside to smoke, she notices and follows:
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Hey! I like your band with Jonah
dialog: Ruiz, L'enfance Nue?
dialog: (she pronounces it
dialog: Lenfance New)
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (correcting her
dialog: pronunciation)
dialog: L’enfance Nue.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I saw your Thanksgiving show. My
dialog: name’s Lady Bird.
dialog: 50.
text: They shake hands. There is something instantly sexual between
text: them. Lady Bird has never felt this thing before. She gets
dialog: all R&B songs ever written in one moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: It’s weird you shake hands.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (lying)
dialog: Yeah, I’m friends with Jenna and
dialog: she’s always talking about how
dialog: great your band is so I wanted to
dialog: check it out.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Jenna’s hella tight. Well maybe
dialog: I’1l see you at the Deuce or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Sure, see you at the Deuce.
scene_heading: COOL TWENTY SOMETHING
dialog: (yelling out to Lady Bird)
dialog: I’m not paying you to flirt!
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: I wasn’t flirting.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I wish you had been.
text: And then he’s gone. Lady Bird’s loins are on fire.
scene_heading: INT. LADY BIRD’S ROOM. NIGHT.
text: She writes Kyle’s name next to where she’d written Danny’s
text: name. Touches her hand where he’d touched it. Then touches
dialog: her mouth. She wants, she wants.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: SECOND SEMESTER
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH. DAY.
text: Joint liturgy at another beginning of the semester. Lady Bird
text: sits next to Julie and sings in the choir and scans for Kyle.
text: From under her choir robe, Lady Bird pulls out “The People’s
text: History of the United States” and reads it while the priest
text: delivers the homily.
text: Danny tries to make eye contact with Lady Bird but she coldly
text: looks away. Her eyes rest on Jenna - she wants Kyle as her
text: boyfriend and Jenna as her friend. She wants to be part of
dialog: this thing, this popular-straight-kid thing she’s always been
dialog: outside of.
text: Lady Bird takes her blessing, arms crossed.
scene_heading: INT. HOMEROOM. DAY.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: The first time we did it was at his
dialog: lake house last summer. It was so
dialog: funny...
text: Julie hands Lady Bird a sack lunch:
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: From Uncle Matt. I think he and my
dialog: Mom are fighting, so enjoy these
dialog: lunches while you can.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Oh, no thanks, I’m trying to lose
dialog: weight.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Really?
text: But Lady Bird isn’t paying attention. She’s angling towards
dialog: Jenna Walton, the tan, who holds court:
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Yeah, sex is not a big deal, it’s
dialog: just my mom called during it!
text: Everyone laughs.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: JENNA (CONT’D)
dialog: It was on my cell phone, she got it
dialog: for emergencies.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Did you pick up?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Yeah, I was like, "um, Mom, I can't
dialog: really talk right now."
text: Everyone else laughs again. Julie now tries to join in:
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (to Jenna)
dialog: What was the emergency?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: What? Oh, my great aunt died.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What was the emergency?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Oh, my great aunt died.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: She kind of did it to herself.
dialog: Yeah. I don’t know why do that if
dialog: you’re already so old.
text: Sister Sarah-Joan approaches:
scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: Ladies - skirts?
text: Jenna's skirt doesn’t make the grade, it’s been hemmed.
speaker_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m going to write you a citation,
dialog: Miss Walton.
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN
dialog: No more short skirts!
text: She continues on, inspecting other skirts.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Sarah-Joan is all up in my jock.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: She’s a cunt.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Birdy you like her.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Yeah, but, she’s a cunt.
dialog: (to Jenna)
dialog: I have an idea of how to get Sarah-
dialog: Joan back...
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: You’1l see. This afternoon?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No, we have auditions this
dialog: afternoon.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I don’t think I want to do the
dialog: play.
dialog: (to Jenna)
dialog: Meet me in the teacher’s parking
dialog: lot at 3. I’1l have the materials.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Wait what was your name?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Lady Bird.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Weird.
scene_heading: SISTER SARAH-JOAN

speaker_heading: GIRL #1
dialog: 53.
dialog: Where’s Father Leviatch?
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTHER
dialog: Alright let’s have everyone take a
dialog: knee.
text: Confusion. Miss Patty won’t make eye contact
dialog: with them
speaker_heading: MISS PATTY
dialog: Cozy sit.
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTHER
dialog: So I know that you all miss Father
dialog: Leviatch, all of the brothers do
dialog: too, but I am going to give this my
dialog: very best shot, okay? Usually I’m
dialog: the J.V. football coach, but from
dialog: what I can tell a “play” is a
dialog: “play.”
text: No real response. Danny sits with Julie, whispers:
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Where’s Lady Bird?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (quietly angry)
text: With her new best friend. She
dialog: thinks she’s too cool for theatre.
text: Father Walther wheels out a blackboard and picks up chalk.
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTHER
dialog: Now if you can pull out your
dialog: scripts. I’ve assigned a number to
dialog: each of your roles. I’m going to
dialog: put the blocking on this board, and
dialog: if you guys can transcribe into
dialog: your plays, that’d be great.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Who is playing what part?
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTHER
dialog: I had Miss Patty assign parts
dialog: because she already knows you all.
text: Miss Patty nods.
speaker_heading: FATHER WALTHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Call ‘em out Miss Patty!
dialog: Miss Patty starts:
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: MISS PATTY
dialog: (slightly drunk on power)
dialog: Uh, Prospero, Danny.
dialog: Julie is Miranda - she’s happy, maybe she’s good at this?
scene_heading: EXT. TEACHER PARKING LOT. AFTERNOON.

speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Wait, where do you live?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Oh, um, the 40s.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: That’s where our starter house was!
dialog: Which street?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (lying, again)
dialog: Um, 44th it’s, um, it’s the three

speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: I know that one! Wanna go over
dialog: there now and eat? I live in
dialog: Granite Bay otherwise I’d say lets
dialog: go there.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Um, actually, I was thinking -
dialog: maybe we should go to the Deuce?
dialog: (trying to be casual)
dialog: I was talking to Kyle about it and
dialog: he was like “whatever it’s lame but
dialog: maybe I’1l see you there.”
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: How do you know Kyle?
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: My Mom made me get a job at New

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: This is the Deuce? It’s a parking
dialog: lot? We were in one parking lot
dialog: and we went to another parking
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: KYLE! Lady Bird and I just
text: decorated the nun-mobile like “just
dialog: married to Jesus!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: That’s hella tight.

speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT’D)
dialog: What you did was very baller, very
dialog: anarchist.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Yeah, fuck ‘em.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Don’t worry, I’m not gonna snitch

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Sorry that was an exaggeration.
speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Can I get your number? We were
dialog: looking to set up some more gigs
dialog: down there...
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Definitely.
text: He holds out his hand and a pen. Lady Bird takes his hand and
text: the pen. When she touches him, it’s the same as before: SEX.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s my parents’ number.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You don’t have a cell phone?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Nah.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Good girl. The government didn’t
dialog: have to put tracking devices on us,
dialog: we bought them and put them on
dialog: ourselves.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I don’t own a tracking device...
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No the cell phones. See?
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yeah. I know. I mean you’1l have

dialog: matter of time.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Before what?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Before they put them in our brains.

scene_heading: INT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: My Grandma wanted me to tell you

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Yeah, well, I couldn’t have gone
dialog: anyway... my Mom was pissed about

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: her.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (suddenly defensive)
dialog: She’s not crazy, she’s just, she has
dialog: a big heart. She’s very warm.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don’t find your mother warm.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: You don’t?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well no yeah she’s warm but she’s
dialog: also kind of scary.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: You can’t be scary and warm.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (logically debating)

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: There is no role of “The Tempest.”

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: And she was sitting there waiting

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Please share.

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: You think dead children aren’t

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: No...

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m just saying that if you took up
dialog: close pictures of my vagina while I
dialog: was on my period it would be
dialog: disturbing but it doesn’t make it
dialog: wrong.
text: GASPS! Sister Sarah-Joan clocks Lady Bird’s escalating mania.
text: She briefly makes eye-contact with her. Lady-Bird is ashamed,

speaker_heading: CASEY

dialog: Excuse me? What did you say?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD

speaker_heading: MARION

speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Thank you for driving.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: You’ re welcome.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: You aren't coming?
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: You can't walk up to the gate
dialog: anymore, anyway.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Yeah, but, I'm going to college.
text: Marion can barely look at her, it’s too hard and she’s too
text: mad and hurts too much.
speaker_heading: MARION
dialog: Dad will walk you to security,
dialog: parking is too expensive here.
text: Marion drives away abruptly. Lady Bird gets smaller in the
text: frame. Marion is the focus. Marion circles, then circles
text: back. She is crying now, she thought it would be easier to
text: not say goodbye but it isn’t. She parks the car. Runs as fast
text: as she can to go say goodbye.
text: Runs into the airport looking for Lady Bird and Larry. Sees
text: Larry walking towards her.
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: (hugging her while she
dialog: cries)
dialog: It’s ok, she’ll be back, she’1l
dialog: come back.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Lady Bird unpacks, putting things in their places. She
text: reaches in the front pocket of her suitcase and pulls out:
text: A manila envelope. She opens it, and all these letters fall
text: out - crumpled up starts and half-starts. She looks at all of
text: them one at a time. They all begin essentially the same:
dialog: “I love you so much and I don’t know how to tell you that, I
dialog: can’t communicate it to you in a way that...”
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Lady Bird is on the phone with Larry:
speaker_heading: LARRY (0.S.)
dialog: She was worried that there would be
dialog: errors, or mistakes or something...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: LARRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: that you’d judge her writing
dialog: abilities.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: I wouldn’t do that.
speaker_heading: LARRY (0.S.)
dialog: I thought you should have them.
speaker_heading: LARRY (0.S.)
dialog: I want you to know how much she
dialog: loves you but also don’t tell her I
dialog: salvaged them, okay?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Ok...
dialog: She touches all these letters her mother couldn’t send. And
text: she can never tell her that she has them.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER DORM ROOM. NIGHT
text: Lady Bird sits in a dorm room full of college freshman. She
text: stares at a half drunk paper cup of rum inher hand. She
text: looks up,
dialog: questioning:
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Hey. Do you believe in God?
speaker_heading: COLLEGE BOY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: COLLEGE BOY
dialog: Because it’s ridiculous.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: People will call each other by
dialog: names their parents made up for
dialog: them but they won’t believe in
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE BOY
dialog: What’s your name?
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
dialog: (considering)
dialog: Christine. My name is Christine.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE BOY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where are you from?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Sacramento.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sorry, where?
text: The music was too loud, he hadn’t heard her. Second try:
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: San Francisco.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Cool! San Francisco is a great
dialog: city.
text: She is immediately ashamed, but pleased with her social
dialog: success. She drinks everything.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Lady Bird is very drunk now. She leans out the window. David
text: does, too. She yells at the sky.
speaker_heading: LADY BIRD
speaker_heading: BRUCE!
speaker_heading: COLLEGE BOY
dialog: No, my name is David.
scene_heading: INT. LADY BIRD’S DORM. NIGHT.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus Christ you have bad music.
dialog: It’s all Greatest Hits.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: But they’re the Greatest, what’s
dialog: wrong with that?

dialog: drunk.

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL. DAY.
text: Christine opens her eyes. Looks at her bracelet. Sits up. A

scene_heading: INT. CHURCH. DAY.
text: Snippets of a sermon, some donation baskets. The choir gets
dialog: up to sing “Blessed Assurance.”
text: Christine listens and then cries, hard, and then starts
text: laughing and singing along. It turns out that her life is
text: just beginning.
text: She ducks into the entry-way of the church. Gets out her
text: phone, calls her home phone. It rings and rings. She leaves a
dialog: message:
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Hi Mom and Dad, it’s me. Christine.
dialog: It’s the name you gave me. It’s a
dialog: good one. Dad, this is more for Mom
dialog: - Hey Mom: did you feel emotional
dialog: the first time that you drove in
dialog: Sacramento? I did and I wanted to
dialog: tell you, but we weren’t really
dialog: talking when it happened. All
dialog: those bends I’ve known my whole
dialog: life, and stores, and the whole
dialog: thing. But I wanted to tell you. I
dialog: love you. Thank you, I’m... thank
dialog: you.
