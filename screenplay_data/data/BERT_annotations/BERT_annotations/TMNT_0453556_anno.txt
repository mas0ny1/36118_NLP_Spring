dialog: Whaaa!!!
text: The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in

speaker_heading: MUGGER
dialog: You crazy?! Put me down, man!

speaker_heading: INTERS (V.O.)

dialog: together with his Four Warrior-
dialog: Priest Generals, they pillaged

text: QUICK SHOTS OF EACH GENERAL. The walk along side Yoatl.
dialog: Possibly slo-mo. We will come to recognize them through their

text: Winters smirks, looking at the mouse who thinks he can take

text: TENSE in anticipation. Instead... Winters comes up with a
scene_heading: MONEY BRICK.
speaker_heading: INTERS
dialog: (tosses money brick)
dialog: So, your job duties were just
dialog: redefined. Congratulations on your
dialog: promotion.
text: SHINK! - Karai pulls out her To and slices the brick in mid-
text: air. Winters STOPS and looks back over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: KARAI
dialog: We may be hired help to you, but
dialog: you should never forget... we are
dialog: the Foot Clan.
text: ON WINTERS - Condescendingly finds this particularly `cute'.
speaker_heading: WINTERS
dialog: Oooooooh...
text: It sets the Foot off. They all grab their weapons, moving
text: toward Winters. Karai flips forward, sword drawn and at
dialog: Winters throat!
text: ...as Winters stands still... and begins to LAUGH.
text: Slowly, the thumping of FOUR SETS OF FEET lumber out of the
text: shadows. Reveal themselves to be THE FOUR STONE GENERALS.
text: They flank Winters, who is just loving the theatricality of
dialog: it all.
text: The Foot Ninja leap back. Winters remains confident and
text: unmoving. Generals SMIRK at Karai and the Foot.
speaker_heading: WINTERS
dialog: I believe we made a deal, Karai. I
dialog: expect you to honor it.
dialog: (beat, stares her down)
dialog: You do understand "honor", don't
dialog: you?
text: Karai stews... unblinking stare. Of course she does.
speaker_heading: WINTERS
dialog: So I don't care what part of
dialog: "muscle for hire" you don't
dialog: understand. I hired your muscle.
dialog: Now exercise the ones attached to
dialog: your feet and...
dialog: (closer - terse)
dialog: ...get back to work.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Karai slowly steps back. Winters smiles wide, reaches into
text: the drawer and takes another brick of bills and tosses it to
speaker_heading: W
text: a Foot Ninja. Then another to a second Ninja.
speaker_heading: INTERS
dialog: So I will double... no, no...
dialog: TRIPLE your pay for your troubles.
dialog: (stare down)
dialog: Are we cool?
text: ON FOOT - They just stare back, blank goggles. Probably
text: seething inside. Winters is flanked by Generals.
speaker_heading: WINTERS
dialog: Are we... cool?
text: The Foot don't move. Tense. Karai finally nods. Terse.
speaker_heading: WINTERS
dialog: Ninjas. No sense of humor.
dialog: (to Generals)
dialog: So how did we fare?
text: CORRIDOR ENTRANCE - a hunched SHAPE undulating in chains is
text: wheeled into the light.
text: Winters approaches it - chained to a high-tech and uplit
text: pallet on the floor. We can barely make it out as being the
text: HAIRY CREATURE from the I-beam fight.
speaker_heading: WINTERS
dialog: (close, quiet)
dialog: So it begins...
text: It SCREAMS. Fights it's restraints. Tires. Breathing heavily.
text: Winters approaches, safely inches away from his fanged maw.
text: Creature suddenly lunges forward! Winters doesn't flinch. He
text: merely grins at the creature.
speaker_heading: WINTERS
dialog: (to General Aguila)
dialog: Were there any problems?
text: AGUILA speaks in a gravelly, hardened voice. He towers over
text: Winters by a foot. Clearly the leader of the four.
speaker_heading: GENERAL AGUILA
dialog: None, my lord.
speaker_heading: WINTERS
dialog: (to Karai)
dialog: You see, now THAT'S a good soldier.

dialog: Oh, let's call it a scavenger hunt.
dialog: (re: Generals)
dialog: I now have the power and know-how,
dialog: but I need the speed and stealth of
dialog: an organization such as your own.
dialog: Not to mention an organization that
dialog: values discretion.
speaker_heading: KARAI
dialog: But of course.
speaker_heading: WINTERS
dialog: You see, I have nine more beasts
dialog: like this that should be coming to
dialog: town very soon. Thirteen in all, to
dialog: be exact.
text: The Four Generals move the monster into a position on the

text: the top of a CAGE inserted over top, creating a cell.
speaker_heading: ARAI
dialog: But... why? Why here? Why now?
speaker_heading: WINTERS
dialog: Instinct, mostly. They're animals

dialog: (looks off, distant)
dialog: And they recognize something
text: familiar in the air... in the
dialog: stars.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What can I say? I'm a lover of

text: The disk ROTATES. WIDER we see that there are already some

text: by darkened silhouettes of creatures that we're probably glad
speaker_heading: W
text: we don't fully see. Glowing eyes pierce out of the darkness.
speaker_heading: INTERS
dialog: So you go and get to know each
dialog: other. And don't forget... play
dialog: nice.

text: It's an insane chase, with Raph trying to lose him as Casey

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Um, Raph?

speaker_heading: NIGHTWATCHER

dialog: Okay, Leo. Wanna play?
text: Nightwatcher drops TWIN BOLOS. He twirls them with

text: other, running through the rain, weapons drawn.
text: They fight. Hard. And with expertise. Two masters duking it
text: out. It surprises Leo. It fills Night with more adrenaline.
text: There's a break. They circle like tigers. Renewing attacks.
text: Night knows every one of Leo's moves, and counters in turn.
speaker_heading: LEONARDO
dialog: What? How did you-

speaker_heading: RAPHAEL

speaker_heading: WINTERS (V.O.)
dialog: It was I who stood on that

text: Winters/Yaotl looks out at the death and destruction. He

text: A SHADOW falls over Winters body. He looks up - it's a
text: ceremonial SHAMAN from their enemies' camp.
speaker_heading: WINTERS (V.O.)
dialog: And we had to pay a price.
text: The Shaman makes hand gestures, chanting. Winters is pulled
text: up in the air, and in a crackle of red electricity, we see
dialog: him become... grayer.
dialog: N GENERALS - Same electricity. Different effect. They
text: scream, slowly turned into STONE. Cracks form on their

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: LEONARDO

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: KARAI

speaker_heading: APRIL

speaker_heading: SPLINTER

speaker_heading: RAPHAEL
