dialog: 
text: City lights. The soaring bridges and glowing windows of New
text: York City. The SOUNDS of a cocktail party.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947. FLASHBACK.
dialog: 
text: A party of bohemian types in the village. Artist's canvases
text: propped up against the walls. A narrow hallway with couples
text: talking intimately. Two rooms crammed with young people
dialog: smoking and drinking.
dialog: 
text: A man and a woman in their 20's stand alone in a corner...
dialog: 
text: FRANK WHEELER, intelligent good-looks, and APRIL JOHNSON, a
text: patrician beauty, a woman amongst girls. He's been making
dialog: her laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So, what do you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: I'm studying to be an actress.
dialog: You?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm a longshoreman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No, I mean really.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I mean really too. Starting
dialog: Monday, though, I'm doing something
text: a little more glamorous. Night
text: cashier at a cafeteria.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I don't mean how you make money. I
dialog: mean what are you interested in?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Honey - if I had the answer to that
dialog: one, I bet I'd bore us both to
text: death in half an hour.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She laughs. He smiles, revelling in her attention.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947, LATER.
dialog: 
text: Later, Frank and April dance. They move well, in sync,
text: looking into each other's eyes. He slides his hand down the
text: silk of April's dress until it rests in the small of her
dialog: back.
dialog: 
text: Close on their hands. Their fingers slowly entwine as they
dialog: lose themselves in each other...
dialog: 
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, PRESENT.
dialog: 
text: Close on Frank's face, seven years later, full of doubt and
text: tension as he watches his wife, April, on stage and as we
text: hear the hollow VOICES of a very bad amateur play...
dialog: 
text: Finally, mercifully, the curtain falls. Nothing. Then
text: vigorous, relieved applause.
dialog: 
text: Frank hears a voice from behind, through the applause:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Thank God that's over...
dialog: 
text: April takes the final bow. She's fighting not to cry. Frank
text: applauds her loudly. Looks around to see who else is joining
text: him. But there is no noticeable crescendo in the applause.
dialog: 
text: Then Frank hears the voice again:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...And she was very disappointing.
dialog: 
text: He can't argue.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER.
dialog: 
text: Frank now moves against the crowd of exiting audience members
text: towards the stage. He keeps his head lowered, avoiding eye-
text: contact, until he feels a hand on his sleeve.
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: MR. AND MRS. GIVINGS, an older couple, are standing in his
dialog: way.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: Frank! Very nice Frank!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thanks, Mrs. Givings.
dialog: 
text: Frank steps around her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: I can't tell you how much we
dialog: enjoyed it. You have a very
dialog: talented wife.
dialog: 
text: Frank forces a smile as he goes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'll pass it along!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: April sits alone at her dressing table crying.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BACK STAGE - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: The CAST mills backstage. The mood is subdued, but some have
dialog: decided to make light of the disaster.
dialog: 
text: Frank moves through the crowd. Across the room, he sees -
dialog: 
text: MILLY CAMPBELL, 30's, determinedly bright, up on her tip-
text: toes. Her husband SHEP, 30's, heavy-set, is still in
text: costume, shell-shocked and pebbled with sweat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Frank!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hi!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: She's through there...!
dialog: (points)
dialog: You `bout ready for that drink?
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Couple of minutes!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Frank enters. The chair in front of the mirror is empty. A
text: cigarette burns in the ashtray. Frank glances at a standing
text: screen in the corner. April's costume is draped over the
text: top. He goes towards it, deciding what to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (heartfelt)
dialog: April, sweetheart. You were great.
dialog: I mean it.
dialog: 
text: The door to the bathroom opens. April enters in street
text: clothes. Frank's been talking to an empty room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Hi. You about ready to leave?
dialog: I've just got to get this makeup
dialog: off, then we can go.
dialog: 
text: She sits in front of the mirror, too embarrassed to look at
text: him. FRANK can see that her face is blotchy from crying. He
text: puts his hand on her shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well... I guess it wasn't a triumph
dialog: or anything, was it?
dialog: 
text: APRIL looks at him in the mirror. She holds his look just a
text: second. And from her expression, he knows he said exactly
dialog: the wrong thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: I guess not. I'll be ready in a
dialog: minute.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Take your time.
dialog: 
text: He removes his hands and lights a cigarette. APRIL begins to
text: take off her makeup.
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Will you do me a favor? Milly and
dialog: Shep wanted us to go out with them
dialog: afterwards. Will you say we can't?
dialog: Say it's because of the baby sitter
dialog: or something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, the thing is, I already said
dialog: that we could. I mean, I just saw
dialog: them out there and I said we would.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (tense)
dialog: Oh. Then would you mind going out
dialog: again and saying you were mistaken?
dialog: That should be simple enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't you think that's a little bit
dialog: rude, April?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Well I'll tell them myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay. Okay. Take it easy. I'll
dialog: tell them.
dialog: 
text: He backs to the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HIGH-SCHOOL CORRIDOR - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: April and Frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor, past
text: school lockers, booster club posters and silent classrooms.
dialog: 
text: They don't touch. They don't speak. The tension between
text: them is palpable.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Frank drives. April stares ahead. Their faces are lit by
text: the dashboard. After a while...
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I mean it, baby. You were the only
dialog: person in that play.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: He looks over at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We just never should've let you get
dialog: mixed up in the damned thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: All right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You've studied for Christ's sake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Could we sort of stop talking about
dialog: it now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sure. I just don't want you
dialog: feeling bad about it, that's all.
dialog: Because it's not worth it. I mean,
dialog: it's bad enough having to live out
dialog: here among these damn people -
dialog: what'd you say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: I said yes. All right, Frank.
dialog: Could you just stop talking now,
dialog: before you drive me crazy, please?
dialog: 
text: Frank clenches his jaw and flips on the indicator.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing? Why are we
dialog: stopping?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: The car comes to a stop at the side of the road.
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Frank turns off the ignition. He slides towards her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: No, Frank, please don't...
dialog: 
text: He puts his arms around her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Baby, it's okay...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Please don't touch me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: April...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Why can't you...just... LEAVE ME
speaker_heading: ALONE!
dialog: 
text: Frank slides back behind the wheel. Beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It strikes me, that there's a
dialog: considerable amount of bullshit
dialog: going on here.... And there's one
dialog: or two things I'd like to clear up.
dialog: Number one, it's not my fault the
dialog: play was lousy. Number two, it's
dialog: sure as hell not my fault you
dialog: didn't turn out to be an actress,
dialog: and the sooner you get over that
dialog: little piece of soap opera the
dialog: better off we'll both be. Number
dialog: three, I don't happen to fit the
dialog: role of dumb, insensitive suburban
dialog: husband; you've been trying to hang
dialog: that one on me ever since we moved
dialog: here. Number four -
dialog: 
text: She opens the door and is out of the car, flashing across the
text: headlights. Frank struggles with his door.
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: April stands in the dark 30 yards from the road looking over
text: an expansive countryside. There's only a few lights in the
text: distance. This is still farmland.
dialog: 
text: Frank comes up behind her, careful to keep his distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What the hell are you doing? Come
text: back to the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: No. Just let me stand here a
dialog: second.
dialog: 
text: Frank raises his arms in exasperation. A car approaches. He
text: puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual. The
text: car's headlights light up April's back, then pass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: April?
dialog: 
text: She doesn't move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, can't we sit in the car and
dialog: talk about it, instead of running
dialog: all over Route Twelve?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Haven't I made it clear I don't
dialog: particularly want to talk about it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay. Jesus, I'm trying to be nice
dialog: about this thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: How kind of you. How terribly,
dialog: terribly kind of you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wait a minute. I don't deserve
dialog: this.
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: You're always so wonderfully
dialog: definite, aren't you, on the
dialog: subject of what you do and don't
dialog: deserve?
dialog: 
text: She turns and walks past him back towards the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wait a minute!
dialog: 
text: He stumbles after her. Other cars whizz by, but he's past
dialog: caring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait a minute, God damn it!
dialog: 
text: She leans against the car and folds her arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You listen to me. This is one time
dialog: you're not going to get away with
dialog: twisting everything I say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Christ, I wish you'd stayed home
dialog: tonight!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know what you are when you're
dialog: like this? You're sick. I really
dialog: mean that. You're sick!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: And you know what you are?
dialog: (eyes raking him)
dialog: You're disgusting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh, yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Just because you've got me safely
dialog: in this little trap, you think you
dialog: can bully me into feeling whatever
dialog: you want!
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You in a trap! You in a trap!
dialog: Jesus, don't make me laugh!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Yes, me.
dialog: (clutching at her chest)
dialog: Me! Me! Me! Oh, you poor, pathetic
dialog: little boy ­­ Look at you! Look at
dialog: you, and tell me how by any stretch
dialog: of the imagination you can call
dialog: yourself a man!
dialog: 
text: He raises his fist, she flinches away, and BONG! BONG! BONG!
text: BONG! He punches the hood of the car. Then, silence. The
text: look April gives him is probably the worst look he's ever
text: received: a look of pitying boredom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't look at me like that, April.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Could we please go home now?
dialog: 
text: She calmly walks around and gets in the car. After a moment,
text: Frank follows...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: They sit silently in the car in the darkness.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: REVOLUTIONARY ROAD
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: A small, attractive suburban house in the morning sunshine.
text: Frank walks out to the car, stops and looks back at the
dialog: house.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: April stands at the window. The SOUND of the car pulling
dialog: away.
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD TRAIN STATION - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Frank stands on a grey platform, amongst a crowd of
text: commuters. The morning commuter train eases into the
dialog: station.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Frank sits against the train window holding a "New Yorker."
text: Around him, the train is crowded with men reading newspapers.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL PLATFORM - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: In one swift movement, all the doors of the commuter train
text: swing open as a hundred feet step down onto the platform.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: An empty stairwell in Grand Central: a tide of grim,
text: determined commuters rise into view. A mass of suits and
text: hats. Frank is amongst them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Knox Headquarters -- a squat, formidable structure. Thick
text: HONKING traffic. Crowded sidewalks.
dialog: 
text: Frank walks with the crowd past a display window: bright
text: cardboard images of fashionable women grin and point their
text: pencils at a list of product benefits - "SPEED, ACCURACY,
dialog: CONTROL."
dialog: 
text: Pride of place at the center of the display is a new Knox 500
text: Electronic Computer with a sign that reads: "Performs A Man's
dialog: Lifetime of Work in Just 30 Minutes!"
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KNOX BUILDING ELEVATOR - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Frank rides crushed against the wall in a crowded elevator.
text: He glances over at -
dialog: 
text: MAUREEN GRUBE, 23, ripe, a little obvious, but undeniably
text: sexy. She meets his look. And looks away.
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Frank opens the bottom right drawer of his desk, props up his
text: feet and lights a cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: I'm going to need your help this
dialog: morning, Old Scout.
dialog: 
text: Seated beside Frank, JACK ORDWAY, 40's, tall and effete with
text: greying hair, appears to be hard at work, hunched over a
text: file. He is, in fact, propping up his head with his hand
text: while shielding his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: For the next few hours, you're to
dialog: warn me of Bandy's every approach
dialog: and you may have to screen me from
dialog: public view in the likely event I
dialog: that I throw up. It's that bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good morning, Jack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nothing good about it, I assure
dialog: you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY.
dialog: 
text: April drags two overflowing garbage cans to the curb. She
text: stops and looks down the empty road. Not a single human
text: being in sight.
dialog: 
text: Close on April's face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MRS. GIVINGS' CAR - DAY, 1948. FLASHBACK.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Givings sits behind the wheel, driving slowly along a
text: suburban street talking at high speed.
dialog: 
text: Frank sits beside her wearing sunglasses. April sits in the
dialog: back.
dialog: 
text: We don't yet see what Mrs. Givings is describing, only as it
text: plays on their faces.
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: Of course, I knew the moment you
dialog: came off the train what you were
text: looking for... A small remodeled
dialog: barn, or a carriage house ­ And I
dialog: just hate to be the one to tell you
dialog: that sort of thing just isn't
dialog: available anymore... But I don't
dialog: want you to despair. There is one
dialog: place down here I want to show
dialog: you... Now of course it isn't very
dialog: desirable at this end.
dialog: (gestures)
dialog: As you see, Crawford Road is mostly
text: these little cinder-blocky, pick-up
dialog: trucky places ­ plumbers,
dialog: carpenters, little local people of
dialog: that sort.
dialog: 
text: Frank turns around to April, lowers his glasses. April
text: stifles a giggle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
dialog: But eventually...
text: (she points, her arm fully
dialog: extended)
dialog: Eventually it leads up to
dialog: Revolutionary Road, which is much
dialog: nicer. Now, the place I want to
dialog: show you, is a sweet little house
text: and a sweet little setting.
dialog: Simple, clean lines, good lawns,
dialog: marvelous for children. It's right
dialog: around this next curve... Now,
dialog: you'll see it ­ there.
dialog: 
dialog: They all look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
dialog: See the little white one? Sweet
dialog: isn't it? The perky way it sits
dialog: there on its little slope?
dialog: Charming, isn't it?
dialog: 
text: April smiles. A smile full of promise.
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Oh, yes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BANDY'S OFFICE - DAY. PRESENT.
dialog: 
text: Frank's FIST raps against the door of an office...
dialog: 
text: TED BANDY, 46, tight and precise, looks up from behind a well-
dialog: organized desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You wanted to see me?
dialog: 
text: Bandy holds out an envelope from behind his desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANDY
dialog: Came for you from Toledo this
dialog: morning.
dialog: 
text: Frank reaches for it, but Bandy moves it out of reach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the third one this month.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh, right, sorry. I thought I'd
dialog: taken care of that...
dialog: 
text: Frank reaches again, but Bandy moves it. A little man
text: enjoying his power.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANDY
dialog: I'm not prepared to have this
dialog: conversation again, Frank. You
dialog: understand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...Absolutely, yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANDY
dialog: These folks in the provinces look
dialog: up to us, Frank. We need to be
dialog: efficient. We can't have this kind
dialog: of back and forth, and so forth.
dialog: It's just not efficient. Am I
dialog: right?
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...Absolutely, yes, yes...
dialog: 
text: Bandy finally hands over the envelope.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - DAY.
dialog: 
text: Frank sits at his desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What was that about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Toledo. Branch manager wants a
dialog: revised brochure for the conference
dialog: on "The Knox 500."
dialog: (impersonating Bandy)
dialog: "It's just not efficient."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (sharp inhale)
dialog: Sounds like a real goodie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't even know what the Knox 500
dialog: does... Do you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't insult me.
dialog: 
text: Frank drops it in his In Box. Then, looking up, he sees
text: Maureen across the office. Thinks.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, MAUREEN'S DESK - DAY.
dialog: 
text: Frank stands over Maureen at her desk. The envelope from
text: Toledo lies in front of her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Now, if you'll look in the inactive
dialog: file under SP-1109 you'll find
dialog: copies of all the stuff we sent to
dialog: the agency... and that way we can
dialog: trace the thing back to its
dialog: original sources.
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She nods, jotting down a note.
dialog: 
text: For the first time, Frank allows himself to take in her
text: profile, her cleavage, her lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope you weren't planning on an
dialog: early lunch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: I'm not really hungry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good. I'll check on you later.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALGONQUIN HOTEL RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Maureen and Frank sit in a secluded corner. Maureen sips a
text: martini. She's already a little drunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You know something? You're lucky
dialog: you met me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Oh? How's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I can show you the ropes. There's
dialog: an art to survival at Knox. Let me
dialog: show you what I mean.
dialog: 
text: He waves over the waiter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Bring me the telephone would you?
text: And two more martinis.
dialog: 
text: Maureen looks daunted at her empty glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Wow.
dialog: 
text: The waiter brings over the phone. Frank dials. He holds his
text: finger to his lips. He uses an authoritative tone.
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hello Mrs. Jorgensen. Frank
dialog: Wheeler here. Just wanted to let
dialog: you know that I've had to send
dialog: Maureen Grube down to Visual Aides
dialog: for me. I'll probably need her the
dialog: rest of the day... Okay? Fine.
dialog: You too.
dialog: 
text: Frank hangs up and smiles at Maureen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: I never even heard of Visual Aides.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's because it doesn't exist.
dialog: 
text: Maureen smiles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
dialog: 
text: Now we're moving behind April as she moves through the silent
text: house. She carries a basket of dirty laundry on her hip.
text: She pulls the bedding off the couch. The distant SOUND of
text: children playing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. GIVINGS (O.S.)
dialog: Yoo-hoo!
dialog: 
text: She turns to see Mrs. Givings at the screen door.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Hi Helen.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: I can't stay a minute... My, don't
dialog: you look comfy! I just wanted to

dialog: 
text: She puts it on the table.

dialog: I think he finds my friends a

dialog: mean, he's travelled. He has a PhD
dialog: in mathematics. I suppose you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: We'd love to Helen.

scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS

speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He was a salesman in Yonkers. Once

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: MAUREEN

speaker_heading: MAUREEN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAUREEN

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: MAUREEN

speaker_heading: APRIL

dialog: about it all day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What's all this about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: You know how much money we have
dialog: saved...?
dialog: 
text: She hands Frank a glass of brandy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Enough to live on for six months
dialog: without you earning another dime.
dialog: And with the money we could get
text: from the house and the car, longer
dialog: than that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What we get for the house...What
dialog: are you talking about? Where are
dialog: we going to live?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: ...Paris.
dialog: 
text: Frank stares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: You always said it was the only

dialog: worth living. So why don't we go
dialog: there?
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're serious?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Yes. What's stopping us?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What's stopping us? Well, I can
dialog: think of a lot of things. For
dialog: instance, what kind of a job could
dialog: I possibly get?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: You won't be getting any kind of
dialog: job, because I will.
dialog: 
text: Frank laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh, right.

speaker_heading: APRIL

dialog: 
text: Frank laughs again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, I don't.

speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: I'm serious about this Frank. Do

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, I know, I know. I just have a

dialog: 
text: She draws back, shocked that he doesn't get it.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Don't you see that's the whole
dialog: idea? You'll be doing what you
dialog: should've been allowed to do seven
dialog: years ago. You'll have time,
dialog: Frank. You'll have time to find
dialog: out what it is that you actually
dialog: want to do, and when you figure it
dialog: out you'll have the time and the
dialog: freedom to start doing it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sweetheart, it's just not very
dialog: realistic, is all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Well, I happen to think this is
dialog: unrealistic. I think it's
dialog: unrealistic for a man with a fine
dialog: mind to go on working like a dog
dialog: year after year at a job he can't
text: stand, coming home to a place he
dialog: can't stand, to a wife who's
dialog: equally unable to stand the same
dialog: things.
dialog: 
text: Frank is silent. How could anyone possibly argue with her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to know the worst part?
dialog: Our whole existence here is based
dialog: on this great premise that we're
dialog: somehow very special and superior
dialog: to the whole thing, and you know
dialog: what I've realized...? We're not!
dialog: We're just like everyone else.
dialog: Look at us! We've bought into the
dialog: same ridiculous delusion. This
dialog: idea that you have to resign from
dialog: life and settle down the moment you
dialog: have children. And we've been
dialog: punishing each other for it.

speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: When I first met you, there was
dialog: nothing in the world you couldn't
dialog: do or be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I was a little wise guy with a big
dialog: mouth, that's all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: You were not! How can you even say
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...All right... So, I'll have
dialog: time. And God knows that's
dialog: appealing. It's very appealing.
dialog: And I mean, everything you say
dialog: might make a certain amount of
dialog: sense, if I had some definite
dialog: talent maybe. If I were an artist
dialog: or a writer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: But Frank, listen to me: It's what
dialog: you are that's being stifled here.
dialog: It's what you are that's being
dialog: denied and denied and denied in
dialog: this kind of life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And what's that?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: That's why I'm assembling a team.
dialog: Men like you, not your average

speaker_heading: BART POLLOCK
dialog: A personal thing? I see.

dialog: 
text: On Frank's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What's the matter?

speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Nothing.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 
text: She finally stops and looks at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: I'm pregnant, that's all.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What...? Jesus.
dialog: 
text: She comes over to him.

speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Oh, Frank, I meant to wait until

dialog: well, I've been pretty sure all
dialog: week and today I went to the Doctor
dialog: and now I can't even pretend it's
dialog: not true.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (still stunned)
dialog: Jesus... How long?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Ten weeks.
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You didn't say anything.

speaker_heading: APRIL

speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I know you are.
dialog: 
text: She looks at him, with slight desperation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: We don't have to let this stop us.
dialog: There are things we can do.
dialog: Remember that girl at school I told
dialog: you about...? As long as you do it
dialog: before 12 weeks, it's fine.
dialog: 
text: He just looks at her and his silence makes her desperate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: We've got to be together in this,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SHEP

speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: I thought you turned the job down?

speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: 
text: April shakes her head and drags on her cigarette.

speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: So you've made up your mind?

speaker_heading: APRIL

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's now April! Don't I get a
dialog: say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: APRIL

speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)

dialog: truth, Frank. Remember that? We
dialog: used to live by it. You know what's
dialog: so good about the truth? Everyone
dialog: knows what it is, however long
dialog: they've lived without it. No one
dialog: forgets the truth, Frank, they just

text: Frank turns towards her.

speaker_heading: APRIL

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I can't say I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Wouldn't have been the same without
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You'd have been sorely missed in
dialog: the old cubicle, I can tell you
dialog: that.
dialog: 
text: He raises his glass, drinks alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Besides which...
dialog: 
text: Frank looks away from the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ...Well, the plan always seemed a
dialog: touch unrealistic, don't you think?
dialog: 
text: Frank glares with barely contained fury.
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I suppose, it's none of my

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. I suppose it isn't.
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, we won't be the only ones

dialog: 
text: Two drumsticks spinning in a spotlight. They click out a
text: rhythm, and crash into a number.
dialog: 
text: Cut back to reveal a small, low-ceilinged joint. On-stage
text: are the Steve Kovack quartet, four perspiring middle-aged men
dialog: with day jobs.
dialog: 
text: YOUNGISH COUPLES, and the odd middle-aged COUPLE navigate the
dialog: dance floor.
dialog: 
text: A smattering of lost SINGLES line the bar.
dialog: 
text: The Wheelers and Campbells sit squashed into a booth on the
text: side of the dance floor.
dialog: 
text: Several empty glasses have accumulated. Milly is beating the
text: edge of the table with red drink straws. She's a few drinks
dialog: ahead.
dialog: 
text: They have to SHOUT over the MUSIC.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Hey! Remember the first time you
dialog: brought us here? You said, it
dialog: takes a special kind of taste to
dialog: enjoy Vito's Log Cabin!
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: It's so awful it's kinda nice!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: That's right!
dialog: 
text: They laugh at the old joke. Then Milly begins to weep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (dabs at her eyes)
dialog: Look at me...! I'm just so happy.
dialog: Our little gang's back together
dialog: again!
dialog: 
text: She knocks her drink back. The number finishes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: At least Europe's not going
dialog: anywhere.
dialog: 
text: April stares out at the dance floor. Frank looks at her. A
text: new number starts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wanna dance?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: I don't really feel like it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: I'll dance!
dialog: 
text: Milly takes him by the hand and pulls him away. Shep and
text: April watch. Then Shep turns his attention to April.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (tipsy)
dialog: Guess April's pretty blue `bout
dialog: Paris, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Think she'll be okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Oh, sure. Give us girls a couple
dialog: of days and we can get over
dialog: anything!
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Frank turns his attention to Milly. He's a good dancer. His
text: movements are fast and aggressive, his mind on April.
dialog: 
text: Milly is a little too drunk, and hurries to keep up,
text: perspiring through her dress. He spins her around and
text: around, back and forth into his arms. Milly begins to look
text: slightly dizzy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Frank.
dialog: 
text: He doesn't hear her over the music, or he doesn't care.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Frank... I...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (sudden remorse)
dialog: You okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Gee...I'm afraid I'm not very...
dialog: 
text: Her body spasms with the need to be sick. She turns and
text: rushes for the lady's room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Frank leads the way through the cars.
dialog: 
text: Shep supports Milly who is now falling down drunk.
dialog: 
text: April walks alone a few paces behind...
dialog: 
text: They reach Shep's car, which is trapped behind several other
dialog: cars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Of all the inconsiderate...
dialog: 
text: A beat. Frank looks to April.
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Look - why don't you take Milly
dialog: home, then go home yourself and
dialog: that would take care of both
dialog: sitters. Then Shep can take me
dialog: home later.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: All right with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to April)
dialog: You'll be alright?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Sure.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: I'm sorry you're not going away
dialog: anymore. I know it was important to

dialog: 
text: April distantly nods her thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't take this wrong; I've been
dialog: there and...they don't have so much
dialog: we don't have here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: It didn't have to be Paris.
dialog: 
text: Shep sips his beer, trying to figure out how to connect with
dialog: her...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: You just wanted out, huh?
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: I wanted in. I just wanted us to
dialog: live again.
dialog: 
text: Shep nods, not entirely sure what she means.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: For years I thought we shared a
dialog: secret...that we would be wonderful
dialog: in the world. I didn't exactly know
dialog: how, but just the
dialog: possibility...kept me hoping.
dialog: 
text: She takes a long slug of her drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: How pathetic is that? To put all
dialog: your hopes in a promise that was
dialog: never made? See, Frank knows...he
dialog: knows what he wants. He's found his
dialog: place. He's just fine. Married, two
dialog: kids. It should be enough. It is
dialog: for him. He's right; we were never
dialog: special or destined or anything at
dialog: all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Sure you are. You're The Wheelers.
dialog: You're a terrific couple, everyone
dialog: says so.

dialog: Come on, let's do it.
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VITO'S LOG CABIN, DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: April and Shep dance.
dialog: 
text: Shep can't dance well, but he's trying. April, on the other
text: hand, is a wonderful dancer. She dances out as far as their
text: joined hands allow and does a little twitching, hip-bobbing
text: curtsies before twisting back, all seemingly effortless. It
text: is joyous, released.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHEP'S CAR - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Shep slips behind the wheel and is immediately kissing her,
text: groping.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Let me take you somewhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: No. Please. Here. Now. In the
dialog: back seat.
dialog: 
text: She climbs into the back seat. He pulls off his jacket and
text: climbs in after her. He folds the jacket under her head for
dialog: a pillow...
dialog: 
text: She remains perfectly still, allowing him to kiss her, to
text: search under her clothing, to kiss her skin and finally, to
text: lift her skirt and pull her clothing aside and make love to
text: her against the vinyl seat cover...
dialog: 
text: As suddenly as it began, it's over. Shep collapses against
text: her. April stares into the darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP (CONT'D)
dialog: April... This is what I've always
dialog: wanted... I love you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Don't say that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: I mean it, I love you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Please, just be quiet for a minute,
dialog: then you can take me home.
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They begin to quietly assemble themselves.

scene_heading: INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Frank stands in the doorway watching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's beautiful out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Yes; it's lovely.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He glances at the calendar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know what today is?
dialog: 
text: She doesn't look at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: It's twelve weeks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: That's right.
dialog: 
text: He walks over to her. He takes her in his arms. She
text: stiffens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Look, this has been kind of a crazy
dialog: summer. We've both been under a
dialog: strain. I mean I know you're
dialog: upset.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: You know I'm not sleeping with you
dialog: and you want to know why?
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She looks him straight in the eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I'm sorry Frank, but I don't
dialog: really feel like talking about it.
dialog: 
text: She pulls herself free of his grasp. He watches as she adds
text: the vegetables in the pot on the stove.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay. What do you feel like
dialog: talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Would it be all right if we didn't
dialog: talk about anything? Can't we just
dialog: take each day as it comes, and do
dialog: the best we can, and not feel we
dialog: have to talk about everything all
dialog: the time?
dialog: 
text: He smiles patiently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't think I suggested we talk
dialog: about everything all the time. My
dialog: point was, we've both been under a
dialog: strain and we ought to be trying to
dialog: help each other as much as we can
dialog: right now.
dialog: 
text: She's utterly uninterested and it's making him nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean God knows my own behavior
dialog: has been pretty weird lately... I
dialog: mean, as it happens... there is
dialog: actually something I'd like to tell
dialog: you about...
dialog: 
text: She continues folding the napkins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been with a girl in the city a
dialog: few times.
dialog: 
text: Finally, she stops moving. She looks at him.
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: A girl I hardly even know. It was
dialog: nothing to me, but she got a little
dialog: carried away. She's just a kid...
dialog: Anyway, it's over now. It's really
dialog: over. If I weren't sure of that I
dialog: guess I could never have told you
dialog: about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Why did you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Baby, I don't know. I think it was
dialog: a simple case of wanting to be a
dialog: man again after all that abortion
dialog: business. Some kind of neurotic,
dialog: irrational need to prove something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: No. I don't mean why did you have
dialog: the girl; I mean why did you tell
dialog: me about it?
dialog: 
text: He is suddenly unsure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean what's the point? Is it
dialog: supposed to make me jealous, or
dialog: something? Is it supposed to make
dialog: me fall in love with you, or back
dialog: into bed with you, or what? I mean
dialog: what am I supposed to say?
dialog: 
text: He tries that same patient smile, but it's not convincing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Why don't you say what you feel?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: I don't feel anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: In other words you don't care what
dialog: I do or who I fuck or anything?
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: No; I guess that's right; I don't.
dialog: 
text: She is frighteningly calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck who you like.
dialog: 
text: His panic mounts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't you see...Don't you see, I
dialog: want you to care.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Oh, I know you do. And I suppose I
dialog: would if I loved you. But you see
dialog: I don't think I do anymore. And I
dialog: only just figured that out. And
dialog: that's why I'd just as soon not do
dialog: any talking right now.
dialog: 
text: She goes back into the kitchen. Frank follows her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh, now don't give me this shit!
dialog: You know God damn well you love me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: You think so?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know GOD DAMN WELL!

speaker_heading: MRS. GIVINGS (O.S.)

text: Frank and April stare at each other, breathless.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. WHEELER DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Frank and the Givings' sit with cocktails. It's painfully
text: awkward. Moving boxes are everywhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: I'm sorry dinner's late. Can I get
dialog: anyone a refill?
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: Oh, don't worry. It's nice just to
dialog: sit for a bit and socialize...You
dialog: really didn't need to go through
dialog: all the trouble of cooking. I can
dialog: see you have a lot to do with
dialog: packing and what not.
dialog: 
text: Frank looks at April. She avoids his look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Actually, there's been a change of
dialog: plans.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: Oh?
dialog: 
text: John looks up.
dialog: 
text: Frank looks at April.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I thought maybe it was obvious...
text: April's pregnant.
dialog: 
text: April manages a forced smile.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: Oh, April! I can't tell you how
dialog: pleased I am. Oh, but I expect
dialog: you'll be needing a bigger house,
dialog: now, won't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hold it a second, Ma.
dialog: 
text: John gets to his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't get this.
dialog: 
text: He fixes Frank with the stare of a prosecuting attorney.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: What's so obvious about it? I mean
dialog: okay, she's pregnant; so what?
dialog: Don't people have babies in Europe?
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: Oh John, really. I don't think we
dialog: need to --
dialog: 
text: John holds up a hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm asking the man a question. If
dialog: he doesn't want to give me the
dialog: answer, I'm assuming he'll have
dialog: sense enough to tell me so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Suppose we just say that people
dialog: anywhere aren't very well advised
dialog: to have babies unless they can
dialog: afford them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (nods slowly)
dialog: Okay. Okay; it's a question of
dialog: money. Money's always a good
dialog: reason...
dialog: 
text: John paces the room, with his hands behind his back like a
text: detective at a murder scene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: But it's hardly ever the real
dialog: reason. What's the real reason?
dialog: Wife talk you out of it, or what?
dialog: 
text: He turns the force of his smile on April.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Little woman decide she isn't quite
dialog: ready to quit playing house?
dialog: 
text: She walks across the room and stabs out her cigarette. Then
text: immediately lights another.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Nah, nah, that's not it. I can
dialog: tell. She looks too tough. Tough
dialog: and female and adequate as hell.
dialog: 
text: He swings around to face Frank.
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, then; it must've been you.
dialog: 
text: Frank stares back defiantly. Rage bubbling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: John, please, you're being very --
dialog: 
text: John holds up his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What happened, Frank? You get cold
dialog: feet, or what? You decide you're
dialog: better off here after all? You
dialog: figure it's more comfy here in the
dialog: old Hopeless Emptiness after all,
dialog: or --
dialog: 
text: Frank's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow, that did it! Look at his
dialog: face! What's the matter, Wheeler?
dialog: Am I getting warm?
dialog: 
text: Frank stares at John, his rage increasing. Mr. Givings gets
text: to his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, son. I think we'd
dialog: better be --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Boy!
dialog: 
text: He lets out his braying laugh. April starts to laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Boy! You know something? I
dialog: wouldn't be surprised if you
dialog: knocked her up on purpose just so
dialog: you could spend the rest of your
dialog: life hiding behind that maternity
dialog: dress. That way you never have to
dialog: find out what he's made of.
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Now look, I think that's just about
dialog: enough out of you. I mean, who the
dialog: hell do you think you are? You
dialog: come in here and say whatever crazy
dialog: God damn thing comes into your head
dialog: and I think it's about time someone
dialog: told you to keep your God damn -
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: He's not well, Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not well, my ass! I don't give a
dialog: damn if he's sick or well or dead
dialog: or alive, he should keep his
dialog: fucking opinions in the fucking
dialog: insane asylum where they belong!
dialog: 
text: April stares at Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GIVINGS
dialog: Let's go, son.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Givings moves John towards the door. Mrs. Givings slowly
text: stands. April is the only one left seated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Big man you got there, April.
dialog: 
text: He winks at April and puts his hat on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Big family man, solid citizen. I
dialog: feel sorry for you. Still, maybe
dialog: you deserve each other.
dialog: 
text: April's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Matter of fact, the way you look
dialog: right now, I'm beginning to feel
dialog: sorry for him, too. I mean, you
dialog: must give him a pretty bad time, if
dialog: making babies is the only way he
dialog: can prove he's got a pair of balls.
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You... fucking..!
dialog: 
text: Frank lunges at John. Mr. Givings tries to hold Frank back.
text: Mrs. Givings leaps between them. She's crying.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: He's not well, Frank!
dialog: 
text: Silence. Mr. Givings slowly releases Frank. He is
text: breathing heavily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. GIVINGS
dialog: All right, John. Let's get on out
text: to the car now.
dialog: 
text: He guides him from the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: I'm sorry April, I'm so sorry...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Right... Sorry, sorry, sorry!
dialog: Okay Ma? Have I said `Sorry'
dialog: enough times? I am sorry, too.
dialog: Damn; I bet I'm just about the
dialog: sorriest bastard I know. Course,
dialog: get right down to it, I don't have
dialog: a whole hell of a lot to be glad
dialog: about, do I?
dialog: 
text: He takes another step towards the door, then stops and turns
text: back, laughing again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, but I'm glad about one thing,
dialog: though.
dialog: 
text: He points a yellow-stained finger at April's stomach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what I'm glad about? I'm
dialog: glad I'm not gonna be that kid.
dialog: 
text: They go out.
dialog: 
text: Frank goes to the liquor cabinet, pours a whiskey and drinks
dialog: it.
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: April watches him from across the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, okay, don't tell me. Don't
dialog: tell me; let me guess. I made a
text: Disgusting Spectacle of Myself.
dialog: Right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Right.
dialog: 
text: He turns to April.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And everything that man said is
dialog: True. Right? Isn't that what
dialog: you're going to say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Apparently I don't have to. You're
dialog: saying it for me.
dialog: 
text: He comes towards her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But you're wrong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Why am I wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Because the man is insane. He's
dialog: fucking insane! Do you know what
dialog: the definition of insanity is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: What is it, Frank?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The inability to relate to another
dialog: human being. It's the inability to
dialog: love.
dialog: 
text: She looks at him. Then she begins to laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: The in -- the in; the inabil; the
dialog: inability to --
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She reels around the room, her laughter increasingly out of
dialog: control.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh. -- Oh, Frank, you really are a
dialog: wonderful talker! If black could
dialog: be made into white by talking,
dialog: you'd be the man for the job. So
dialog: now I'm crazy because I don't love
dialog: you -- right? Is that the point?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. Wrong. You're not crazy and
dialog: you do love me; that's the point.
dialog: 
text: He takes a step towards her.
dialog: 
text: All the laughter goes out of her face. She backs away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL

dialog: sight of you. You're just a boy who
dialog: made me laugh at a party once and
dialog: if you come any closer, if you
dialog: touch me or anything I think I'll
dialog: scream.
dialog: 
text: He takes her by the arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh baby listen --
dialog: 
text: She SCREAMS. High and shrill. Her eyes wide open, cold and
text: perfectly calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck you, April. And fuck all your
dialog: hateful, snotty little -
dialog: 
text: She slips past him.
dialog: 
text: He goes after her.
dialog: 
text: She pulls a chair into his path.
dialog: 
text: He SLINGS it against the wall.
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: What're you going to do now? Are
dialog: you going to hit me? To show how
dialog: much you love me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh, no, don't worry, I can't be
dialog: bothered! You're not worth the
dialog: trouble it'd take to hit you.
dialog: You're not worth the powder it'd
dialog: take to blow you up. You're an
dialog: empty --
dialog: 
text: He begins to shake with anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You're an empty, hollow fucking
dialog: shell of a woman. What the hell
dialog: are you living in my house for if
dialog: you hate me so much? Huh? Will
dialog: you answer me that? Why the hell
dialog: do you fuck me? What the hell are
dialog: you carrying my child for?
dialog: 
text: He points at her belly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Why the hell didn't you just get
dialog: rid of it, when you had the chance?
dialog: Because listen. Listen: I got news
dialog: for you. I wish to God you had.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - EVENING.
dialog: 
text: Frank enters the bedroom and slams the door.
dialog: 
text: He paces, slowly calming.
dialog: 
text: He sits on the bed with his head in his hands... His mind
text: racing. Then he's on his feet again. He rushes for the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - EVENING.
dialog: 
text: Frank enters, running, but the kitchen is empty. Frank runs
text: out of the room into living room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - EVENING
dialog: 
text: The living room is empty. He goes straight for the front
dialog: door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - EVENING.
dialog: 
text: Frank bursts out the front and comes to a stop.
dialog: 
text: She's across the street - climbing unsteadily into the
dialog: woods...
dialog: 
text: Frank breaks into a sprint.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - EVENING.
dialog: 
text: April walks through the woods.
dialog: 
text: Frank runs up behind her, scrambling through the muddy
text: bracken.
dialog: 
text: April wheels around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Don't come any closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: April, listen, I --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Don't come any closer. Can't I
dialog: even get away from you in the
dialog: fucking woods?
dialog: 
text: He stops moving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: April, listen, I didn't mean that.
dialog: Honestly; I didn't mean what I
dialog: said.
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Are you still talking? Isn't there
dialog: any way to stop your talking? I
dialog: NEED to think. Can't you see that?
dialog: 
text: She backs up against a tree trunk, looking down at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Please come back. What're you
dialog: doing out here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Do you want me to scream again,
dialog: Frank? Because I will, if you say
dialog: another word! I mean it!
dialog: 
text: Frank has no choice - they're outside. The neighbors would
text: hear and call the police. He reluctantly backs away, then
text: turns back the way he came, glancing over his shoulder as he
dialog: goes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Frank stands at the window watching the section of woods
dialog: where he left April.
dialog: 
text: Then, he sees her come back across the street. She walks
text: around the side of the house. He turns and runs into the
dialog: kitchen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Frank goes to the window. He watches April walk up into the
text: yard and stop against a tree.
dialog: 
text: Frank pours a drink and takes the bottle with him to the
text: window. He looks out, drinking.
dialog: 
text: In the darkness, he can make out the glow of April's
text: cigarette deep in the woods.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER.
dialog: 
text: Frank falls back on the bed.
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He's now very drunk.
dialog: 
text: His eyes close as he slips into unconsciousness.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Frank wakes alone. He looks around the room. His head is
dialog: throbbing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Frank stands in the doorway dressed for work. He stares...
dialog: 
text: The kitchen has been tidied and is bathed in sunlight. The
text: table has been carefully set for two.
dialog: 
text: April stands at the stove wearing a fresh maternity dress.
text: She seems serene.
dialog: 
text: April turns and looks at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Good morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good morning.
dialog: 
text: He stands there frozen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Would you like scrambled eggs or
dialog: fried?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh. It doesn't really matter -
dialog: Uh... scrambled, I guess, if it's
dialog: easy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Fine. I'll have scrambled too.
dialog: 
text: Frank sits at the table.
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING, MOMENTS LATER.
dialog: 
text: Frank and April sit across the kitchen table, eating. For
text: several moments, only the sound of their cutlery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's kinda nice having breakfast
dialog: without the kids for a change.
dialog: 
text: April reaches out to pour him some orange juice. Her hands
text: shake slightly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Yes. I thought you'd probably want
dialog: a good breakfast today. I mean it's
dialog: kind of an important day for you,
dialog: isn't it? Isn't this the day you
dialog: have your conference with Pollock?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Yes. That's right, yes.
dialog: 
text: He shrugs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Big deal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: I imagine it is a pretty big deal;
dialog: for them, anyway. What exactly do
dialog: you think you'll be doing? You
dialog: never have told me much about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Haven't I? Well... I think this
dialog: whole thing is about Knox getting
dialog: ready to buy up one of these really
dialog: big computers, bigger than the
dialog: `500'. Did I tell you about that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: No, I don't believe you did.
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, you know -- Basically it's
dialog: just a...a big, fast adding
dialog: machine. Only...
dialog: 
text: He takes a pencil from his inside pocket and delicately
text: sketches the computer on the napkin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Instead of mechanical parts, you
dialog: see, it's got thousands of little
text: individual vacuum tubes.
dialog: 
text: She picks up the drawing and looks at it. It's surprisingly
dialog: delicate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Oh, I see. At least I think I see;
dialog: yes. It's really sort of --
dialog: interesting, isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, I don't know, it's -- yeah, I
dialog: guess it is sort of interesting, in
dialog: a way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: You should value what you do Frank.
dialog: You're obviously good at it.
dialog: 
text: He smiles, flattered and surprised. He slips the pencil into
text: the inside pocket of his suit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Guess I'd better be getting
dialog: started.
dialog: 
text: He stands. April stands up too, smoothing her skirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, though, April; this was
dialog: really nice... I mean it was a
dialog: swell breakfast. Really; I don't
dialog: know when I've ever had a -- a
dialog: nicer breakfast.
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Thank you... I'm glad; I enjoyed it
dialog: too.
dialog: 
text: They stand there gazing at one another across the table.
text: Suddenly, inexplicably, his eyes are filled with tears.
dialog: 
text: He turns and walks to the door. He puts his hand on the
text: handle and turns back once more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Then you don't -- You don't hate
dialog: me, or anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: No; of course I don't.
dialog: 
text: She comes over to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Have a good day.
dialog: 
text: He leans down and kisses her tenderly. They look at one
text: another a moment longer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, then... So long.
dialog: 
text: He steps through the door. She catches the door before it
text: shuts and watches him through the screen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: April walks out onto the driveway as the car reverses away
text: down the drive.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER CAR - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Frank backs the car onto the road. He slides the car into
text: drive and then catches sight of April in the driveway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: April sees Frank looking back at her. She waves. Frank
text: waves from the car and drives off...
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then April is alone. She shivers from the morning chill.
text: She turns and looks back at the house.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: April enters through the screen door and goes to the table.
text: She looks down at Frank's diagram and carefully places it
dialog: aside.
dialog: 
text: She carries the dishes to the sink and begins to wash them.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, her body convulses as she tries to hold back from
text: crying. And then there is no stopping the tears...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: April is standing by the phone, with her hand on the
text: receiver, rehearsing. She is smoking. She dials.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Hello... Milly? Everything all
dialog: right? My voice sounds what...?
dialog: 
text: April uses both hands to grip the receiver.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not
dialog: feeling any better... If it's not
dialog: an inconvenience for you... This
dialog: evening would be great. What...?
dialog: Oh, well- no, not if they're
dialog: outdoors playing. Don't call them
dialog: in.
dialog: 
text: The cigarette shreds in April's hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Just give them - you know, give
dialog: them each a kiss for me, and give
dialog: them my love, and tell them - you
dialog: know... All right, Milly. Thanks.
dialog: 
text: She hangs up and begins to cry again. Takes a breath.
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: FOOTSTEPS...
dialog: 
text: We move behind April as she walks through the silent house.
dialog: 
text: The distant SOUND of children playing outside.
dialog: 
text: Each room she passes is a pocket of silence.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: April makes the bed.
dialog: 
text: She arranges her shoes on the floor of the closet.
dialog: 
text: April reaches onto a shelf behind some clothes. Pulls out
text: the brown paper package.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING.
dialog: 
text: April stands at the stove over a pot of rolling, boiling
dialog: water.
dialog: 
text: She removes the rubber syringe from its paper packaging and
text: drops it into the pot. She checks her watch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
dialog: 
text: April carries the pot of boiling, sudsy water down the hall.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - DAY.
dialog: 
text: April places the pot into the tub. She lays towels across
text: the floor. And closes the door...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - DAY, MOMENTS LATER.
dialog: 
text: The SOUND of running water. The empty mirror. April's face
text: rises up into the reflection with a gasp.
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
dialog: 
text: We move with April down the hallway, her face is pale.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DAY, LATER.
dialog: 
text: Now April stands at the picture window. She is shaking.
dialog: 
text: A DROPLET of blood slides down her knee. She looks down.
dialog: 
text: On the floor, two droplets of blood appear between her bare
dialog: feet...
dialog: 
text: Now we see the bright maple leaf of blood seeping through her
text: skirt. She is shaking more.
dialog: 
text: She walks slowly out of the room, towards the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APRIL (O.S.)
dialog: I think I need an ambulance....
dialog: Yes... One one five Revolutionary
dialog: Road.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL KITCHEN - DAY.
dialog: 
text: Milly folds laundry. She looks up to see -
dialog: 
text: An ambulance turns into the Wheeler's driveway. Her face
text: clouds with instinctual foreboding.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Shep steps out into a hospital hallway.
dialog: 
text: Frank paces, helpless in the waiting room, his face a mask of
text: bewildered, childlike confusion. He looks up to see -
dialog: 
text: Shep coming towards him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Frank? They tell you what
dialog: happened?
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jesus, Shep. I couldn't even
dialog: understand half the things he told
dialog: me. He said the fetus was out
dialog: before they got her here. He said
dialog: they had to operate to take out the
dialog: whatdycallit, the placenta and now
dialog: she's still bleeding. He said
dialog: she'd lost a lot of blood before
dialog: the ambulance came, and now they're
dialog: trying to stop it, and he said a
dialog: whole lot of things I didn't get,
dialog: about capillaries, and he said
text: she's unconscious. Jesus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: How about sitting down, Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What the hell do I want to sit down
dialog: for!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Okay. Take it easy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: My God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Here, have a cigarette.
dialog: 
text: Shep offers the pack. Frank doesn't take one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She did it to herself, Shep.
dialog: 
text: Shep's face as he realizes what he's saying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: She did it to herself.
dialog: 
text: Shep takes a cigarette for himself. He lights it with
text: trembling fingers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: I'll get some coffee.
dialog: 
text: Frank looks over at Shep as if he'd forgotten him. He nods.
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Shep stands and walks down the hall.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - COFFEE MACHINE - AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Shep stands at a coffee machine, gathering himself. He looks
text: up. He begins to feed coins into the machine. His hands are
text: trembling. He drops a coin. It rolls under the machine. He
text: has to get down on his hands and knees to retrieve it...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON.
dialog: 
text: Shep walks tentatively, holding a cup in each hand, slopping
text: coffee onto the floor...
dialog: 
text: He rounds the corner and stops.
dialog: 
text: Frank is no longer in his chair at the end of the long
text: echoing hallway. Shep looks around...
dialog: 
text: Then suddenly, the double doors are flung open and a number
text: of nurses hurry out. Behind them, comes Frank, supported by
dialog: two Doctors.
dialog: 
text: Shep runs to them as they move Frank over to a chair. He's
text: in shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. No. No.
dialog: 
text: They try to make him sit, but he stays stubbornly on his
text: feet, the chair skidding behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Try to sit down, Mr. Wheeler.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Sit down Frank.
dialog: 
text: Frank looks at Shep - his face is a terrifying blank.

scene_heading: EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD - MAGIC HOUR.

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: We hear the WHISK of running footsteps on the asphalt, the

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL LIVING ROOM - EVENING, ONE YEAR LATER.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: ...It was the worst experience of

speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: No. Too many memories, I think.

speaker_heading: MILLY (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: Shep turns and walks out of the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - EVENING.
dialog: 
text: Shep walks across the lawn to the edge of the property. He

dialog: 
text: Shep's face, looking out. His eyes are filled with tears.
text: Milly comes up behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: You okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Mm-hmm.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: It's Jennifer and Michael. They seem happy, engrossed. Other

scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: I can't tell you how pleased I am
dialog: about the little Revolutionary Road
dialog: place, Howard. Remember how dreary
dialog: it looked all winter? All cold and
dialog: dark and -- well, spooky. Creepy-
dialog: crawly. And now whenever I drive
dialog: past, it gives me such a lift to
dialog: see it all perked up and spanking
text: clean again, with lights in the
dialog: windows. And do you know, I was

scene_heading: MRS. GIVINGS
dialog: Oh, I was very fond of the Wheelers
