text: CREDITS OVER PHOTOS IN AN ALBUM
text: The photos include a sepia-tone portrait of an Italian
text: immigrant family... a b&amp;w snapshot of ROBERTA, a nine-year-
text: old girl playing violin in front of a refrigerator (1950)...
text: ...Roberta and her dashing Italian father, hand-carving a
text: wooden music stand... a b&amp;w snapshot of Roberta in a communion
text: dress... Roberta at 15, playing violin in front of the same
text: refrigerator, eyes on the music stand...
text: ...a color photo of two cute blonde little boys building a
text: sandcastle on a beach... a color photo of a groom in a white
text: naval uniform and his pretty bride, (Roberta at 25), her
text: hand over his as they cut their wedding cake with a sword...
text: ...a color photo of Roberta and her husband Greek dancing
text: with another couple at an outdoor taverna. Roberta's husband
text: and the other man's sexy wife are exchanging a slight smile...
text: HOLD ON THIS LAST PHOTO as we now see the ALBUM open on the
text: floor of a bedroom, as if it's been tossed. We are:
scene_heading: INT. GUASPARI HOUSEHOLD, ROME, N. Y. - BEDROOM - DAY (1988)
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Wake up, Roberta!
text: We hear the sound of KNOCKING as the CAMERA PANS a small,
text: darkened guest room. A few streaks of daylight filter through
text: Venetian blinds.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Come on, Bert -- get out of bed!
text: The CAMERA finds a WOMAN lying face down on a twin bed, thick
text: wavy hair sprawled across her shoulders.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Please, Bert -- you need to get out
dialog: of that bed.
text: The KNOCKING continues, and she puts the pillow over the top
text: of her head.
speaker_heading: END CREDITS
scene_heading: INT. GUASPARI BEDROOM - DAY
scene_heading: The WOMAN -- ROBERTA GUASPARI-DEMETRAS (38) -- retrieves the
text: photo album from the floor, looks at a photo and removes it.
text: She's a beautiful woman with large, expressive eyes, but
text: right now she looks like hell. She stares at the photo --
text: it's the two couples dancing. A quick glimpse of hurt on her
text: face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half.
text: There's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young
text: boys' voices.
speaker_heading: BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Can you come out now, Mommy? Please?
text: She puts the half with her and her husband on the dresser,
text: then tears the woman off the other half and rips her into
dialog: pieces.
speaker_heading: BOY #2 (O.S.)
dialog: Mommy, Nick broke my crayon!
speaker_heading: BOY #1 (O.S.)
dialog: Well, Lexi hit me and he almost
dialog: broke... he almost broke my ear!
text: O.S. arguing "I DID NOT!" "YES YOU DID!" "LIAR!" etc. As if
text: that one action siphoned all her energy, Roberta returns to
text: bed, gets into fetal position, and stares at a point beyond
text: the wall, ignoring the O.S. voices.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hear that? Your boys need you.
scene_heading: EXT. GUASPARI HOUSE - DOORWAY - DAY
text: ASSUNTA GUASPARI (58), Roberta's slender, tired Italian-
text: American mother, stands in the doorway of a well-tended
text: working-class home, addressing a young NAVAL OFFICER who
text: holds a lengthy delivery inventory. It's a gray day with
text: ominous storm clouds. Late 70's CARS are parked on the street.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: But I have no room for this!
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: I'm sorry, M'am. We have orders to
dialog: deliver these.
text: Assunta looks beyond the man, dismayed.
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: Large wooden CRATES cover her front lawn, and TWO MOVERS
text: plant down another. They hurry back to the TRUCK, grabbing
text: the next crate too quickly this time. It slips from their
text: hands, CRASHES to the ground and splinters open. Several
text: VIOLIN CASES spill out. The crate looks like it holds a whole
dialog: lot more.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Instantly a second-story window is flung open, and Roberta
text: sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than
dialog: we've seen her so far.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Watch it, you idiots! Be careful
dialog: with those!
text: The men scramble to pick them up. Assunta looks at all the
text: violins, then up at Roberta.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: Why so many?
text: Roberta disappears inside and slams the window shut.
scene_heading: INT. GUASPARI LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The living room is filled with boxes shipped from Greece,
text: labelled by the U.S. NAVY. And on the floor, in the middle
text: of the boxes, are FIFTY VIOLIN CASES of various sizes, also
scene_heading: with Greek and U.S. NAVY labels. NICK (7) and LEXI (5) climb
text: over the boxes as if they were giant blocks.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Mommy, which box has our toys?
scene_heading: INT. GUASPARI HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: ROBERTA'S on the phone, yelling at someone. She's still in
text: the same ratty nightgown.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Look, I know he's there, so quit
dialog: lying to me!... Then check under
dialog: Lana Holden -- Mrs. Lana Holden...
dialog: Fine. Just tell Lieutenant Demetras
dialog: that his wife called and --
text: ASSUNTA grabs the phone from her hand and hangs it up.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Ma!
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: No. I want you to listen to me. You
dialog: can't keep doing this to yourself --
dialog: or to the boys. They need their mother
dialog: now. You're a beautiful, talented
dialog: woman and you have your whole life
dialog: ahead of you.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: If I'm so beautiful and talented,
dialog: why did Charles leave me?
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: Because Charles is a big jerk.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now get dressed.
text: She exits, leaving Roberta to mull over her words.
scene_heading: INT. GUASPARI KITCHEN - DAY
text: Coffee is brewing and homemade cinnamon rolls are cooling on
text: a rack. We recognize the kitchen from the home movie footage.
text: As Assunta clears the boys' breakfast dishes from the table,
text: Roberta enters. She's dressed, but hasn't put on makeup or
text: done much with her hair. It's a start.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You really think Charles is a jerk?
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: From the day you married him.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Why didn't you say something?
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: Since when do you listen to me?
text: Roberta half-smiles, pours herself some coffee, then sits
text: down at the table.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (sighs, then)
dialog: What am I gonna do?
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: First, you eat breakfast. Second,
dialog: you go out and get a job -- any job.
dialog: Your boys, god-bless-em, are good
dialog: eaters -- but I can't afford it.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Mama, he's gonna get tired of her --
dialog: you'll see.
text: Assunta's face shows she's doubtful about this.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: Well in the meantime, get a job.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - GIFT WRAP COUNTER - ROME, N.Y. - DAY
text: Roberta is behind the counter, meticulously wrapping a present
text: with ribbons, bows and stickers. At one point she even unties
text: a ribbon and redoes it because it's not perfect. She looks
text: pretty, but she's dressed conservatively, like a navy
text: housewife. There's only one other clerk wrapping gifts and a
text: long line of impatient customers. A male SUPERVISOR appears
text: behind Roberta.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Just wrap. You're not Picasso.
text: He exits, and Roberta quickly tries to finish her task.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Picasso would probably put the bows
text: on the back of the box.
text: Roberta looks up to find BRIAN TURNER (40), a handsome, sexy
text: guy with longish hair and a beat-up leather jacket.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Brian Turner?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Hello, Roberta.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I thought you moved away.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I did. I'm in town for my Mom's
dialog: birthday.
text: He holds out his hand. Roberta misunderstands the gesture
text: and tries to shake his hand.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No -- that's her gift.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Oh! Sorry.
text: Roberta hands him the gift she's been wrapping.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It looks very pretty.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I heard you had a book published. I
dialog: didn't read it but...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's O.K. My parents didn't read
dialog: it either. It looks good on their
dialog: coffee table, though.
text: Roberta smiles.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: So what are you doing here? I thought
dialog: you'd be in Carnegie Hall by now.
text: HOLD ON ROBERTA as she takes this in.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - ROME, N.Y. - DAY
text: Roberta sits opposite Brian. Her lunch is untouched.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: My college professors said it was
dialog: too late -- I hadn't had enough
dialog: training to be a concert violinist.
dialog: So I got a teaching degree instead.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'll bet you're a great teacher.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I think I am. It's just that...
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: See, every time I'd get started
dialog: somewhere, Charles would be
dialog: transferred... then I had my kids
dialog: and took time off to raise them...
dialog: and then when I decided to teach
dialog: again, no one would hire me 'cause
dialog: you can't count on a navy wife to
dialog: stick around. I finally decided I'd
dialog: start my own program -- Charles gave
dialog: me the money and I bought fifty
dialog: violins from this little Greek shop --
dialog: got started at a private school and
dialog: then...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Your husband ran off with your best
dialog: friend.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: She wasn't my "best" friend. She was
dialog: a friend.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Charles is the last person you'd
dialog: think would cheat on me -- he never
dialog: broke a rule...
dialog: (a few beats)
dialog: I wake up one night -- it's like one
dialog: in the morning -- and he's not in
dialog: bed. I go outside and our neighbor --
dialog: this old Greek guy -- is sitting out
dialog: there, smoking a cigar, so I ask if
dialog: he's seen my husband. "He's taking a
dialog: walk with the other officer's wife,"
dialog: he says. "He takes a walk every night
dialog: with the other officer's wife."
text: A beat as she gets lost in the memory. She takes a bite of a
dialog: french fry.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: God, these are cold.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: So you're just gonna wrap presents
dialog: and wait for him to come back?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You sound like my mother.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's not very sexy.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Are you trying to be sexy or be my
dialog: friend?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: A little of both.
text: Roberta smiles, blushing a bit. Brian looks at her, getting
dialog: an idea.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You know, I know this really cool
dialog: lady who runs this elementary school --
dialog: I wrote a piece on her. It's a public
dialog: school, but it's alternative -- she
dialog: might be able to create some kind of
dialog: gig for you. Let me give her a call.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Great!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (takes his last bite
dialog: of sandwich)
dialog: If she hires you, though, you have
dialog: to be willing to relocate.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Where is it?
scene_heading: EXT. SPANISH HARLEM, NEW YORK CITY - TRAVELLING SHOT - DAY
text: A SALSA SONG PLAYS OVER as we see stores with Spanish names
text: and signs; Black and Latino elementary school children walking
text: home from school; some burned-out buildings; Black and Latino
text: teens playing basketball on a cement court; Spanish graffiti
text: on walls; elderly women buying fruit at a produce stand.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL this is the POV of Roberta from the back
text: seat of a cab. The SALSA SONG plays on the cab's radio.
text: Roberta looks scared shitless.
text: Suddenly, two YOUNG MEN flash down the middle of the street,
text: dart IN FRONT of the cab and the driver SLAMS on the brakes,
text: jerking Roberta forward.
speaker_heading: TAXI DRIVER
dialog: Welcome to East Harlem.

scene_heading: HARLEM - ESTABLISHING - DAY
scene_heading: INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - DAY
text: JANET WILLIAMS, a Black woman (40's) with a kind face, sits
text: behind her desk and looks at Roberta's resume. A sign on her
text: desk indicates that she's the DIRECTOR. Also on the desk is
text: a FRAMED PICTURE of Janet, her husband, daughter (14), and
text: son (12). Roberta sits nervously in the chair opposite her.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: (looking at resume)
dialog: Aside from half a term in a private
dialog: school -- in Greece -- and a year
dialog: teaching chorus in Hawaii -- ten
dialog: years ago -- it doesn't look like
dialog: you've had any other teaching
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, not traditional teaching
dialog: experience. I've been doing private
dialog: lessons...
text: Janet looks for this on the resume.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: It's not on there... I taught my
dialog: sons.
text: Janet smiles politely.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: I'd like to help you, Mrs. Demetras.
dialog: Brian spoke highly of you and I told
dialog: him I'd consider starting a violin
dialog: class... But without the proper
dialog: qualifications, and without any
dialog: experience in an inner city school...
text: Roberta nods, defeated.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: I'm very sorry.
scene_heading: INT. CPE 1 - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Roberta stands outside Janet's office, dejectedly watching
text: the children noisily running through the hall.
scene_heading: INT. AREA OUTSIDE JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY
text: Roberta knocks on Janet's door.
speaker_heading: JANET (O.S.)
dialog: Yes?
text: As Roberta opens the door, we see that Nick and Lexi are
text: with her. All three have violins. INSIDE, Janet's in
text: conversation with DENNIS RAUSCH (38), an uptight man with a
text: tie that doesn't match his suit jacket. He's showing Janet a
text: large scheduling chart.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm sorry to interrupt, but I wanted
dialog: you to meet my sons -- Nick, Lexi...
text: They enter.
scene_heading: INT. JANET'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Janet smiles at the boys, but clearly thinks Roberta's a
text: little off. Roberta holds her hand out to Dennis.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Roberta Guaspari-Demetras.
text: Dennis shakes her hand, regarding her warily.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: This is Dennis Rausch, our music
dialog: teacher and program coordinator.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mrs. Demetras, didn't I make things
dialog: clear yesterday?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: If I could just show you something --
dialog: it'll only take a minute.
text: Before Janet can answer, Roberta and the kids quickly take
text: out their violins and get into position. Janet and Dennis
text: exchange a look.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Are we having a talent show? I should
dialog: have brought my tap shoes.
text: Roberta ignores the jab, then nods to the boys. The three of
text: them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio, playing an
text: ETUDE in three-part harmony. For the first measures, Janet's
text: still annoyed by the intrusion, but she's quickly won over.
text: Dennis watches impassively.
text: Roberta and the boys finish their piece; Janet applauds and
text: Dennis joins in to be polite. The three take bows. A beat.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Will you hire her now?
text: Janet laughs, then gestures for them to sit.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: How long have you boys been playing?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Since I was three.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: (contemplates, then)
dialog: Maybe since I was three and a half.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Your mom must be a good teacher.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: She's O.K.
text: Roberta gives Nick a look, but Janet smiles.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: (to Roberta)
dialog: If you could teach our students to
dialog: play like that, I'd be thrilled, but --
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I can. Any child can learn the violin.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Assuming they had the discipline.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'll teach them to have discipline.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: A lot of our parents are struggling
dialog: to feed their kids and pay the rent --
dialog: they don't have time to help them
dialog: learn violin.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: They don't have to. If they can help,
dialog: great -- but these kids will be
dialog: committed. They'll practice on their
dialog: own, they'll help each other in the
dialog: classroom --
text: Dennis laughs. Roberta looks at him, a bit miffed.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: (with an edge)
dialog: I think I know these students, Miss
dialog: Demetras. Their attention span doesn't
dialog: go past do-re-mi. Maybe on a good
dialog: day, I can get them to "fa."
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You're underestimating them. They
dialog: can play as well as any other kids.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: That I'd like to see.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You will.
text: A beat. Janet observes the tension, then turns to Roberta.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: (to Roberta)
dialog: For now I'll put you down as a sub,
dialog: but I have to warn you -- even if it
dialog: works out, the Board may not let me
dialog: create a permanent position for you.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: That's O.K. I'll worry about that
dialog: later.
dialog: (with a grateful look)
dialog: Thank you.
text: We see relief -- and fear -- in Roberta's face.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: (to Janet)
dialog: Well, I've already planned out the
dialog: whole term, and I can tell you right
dialog: now, there's no room for this!
dialog: Besides, where you gonna find money
dialog: for violins?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You need violins?
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: In a noisy music room with bad acoustics, Roberta tries to
text: take control of fifty kids, third through fifth-graders, who
text: are in a state of manic excitement over the FIFTY VIOLIN
text: CASES on the floor.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Please do not open the cases, O.K.?
text: They ignore her.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Look, can everyone just settle down
dialog: and listen to me -- please?
text: ANGLE - Three girls open their cases.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (starting to lose it)
dialog: Keep them closed! Please.
text: ANGLE - Two boys open their cases.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to the boys)
dialog: Did you hear what I just said?
text: ANGLE - Three kids are using the violin cases as pretend
text: machine guns -- and shooting each other.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Put those down, please!
text: ANGLE - A boy and a girl are having a "sword fight" with
dialog: their bows.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to the fencers)
dialog: Don't do that! Put the bows back in
dialog: the cases -- right now!
text: There's the SOUND of violin strings being plucked.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Who's plucking?
text: Roberta wheels around to find a girl plucking her violin
text: like a banjo, and doing a little dance. This is LUCY, a skinny
text: Puerto Rican girl in perpetual motion.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What have I been saying? Put that
dialog: away! Back in the case!
text: Roberta takes a breath. The kids settle down a bit.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: O.K. Thank you. That's much better.
dialog: (takes another breath)
dialog: I'll be dividing you into five
dialog: classes, but for today --
text: ANGLE - A boy plays "bongos" on his violin case.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: O.K. -- that's it! You! Stand up!
text: The bongo player stands.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You will be the first student who
dialog: will NOT be in my violin class. Out!
text: The child looks stunned.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I said OUT!
text: With a sheepish expression, he exits. The room is finally
text: quiet -- and Roberta's amazed that something worked. She
text: puffs up a little bit, enjoying the feeling of control.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Who else would like to be kicked out
dialog: of my class?
text: The students stare at her, afraid of her now. DE SEAN, a
text: small but tough Black boy, raises his hand.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Are you raising your hand because
dialog: you want to be kicked out?
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: I don't wanna learn no stupid violin.
dialog: It's for wimps.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: I just know.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: De Sean.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, De Sean -- you haven't given
dialog: me a good enough reason, so you're
dialog: staying.
text: She looks around the room.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Anyone else?
dialog: Silence.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - LATER
text: In front of the class, Roberta helps NAEEM, a graceful Black
text: boy, hold the violin. He has a serious expression and a scar
text: on his left cheek. Roberta controls the bow and fingerboard,
text: but it appears that the boy is playing music. He smiles.
speaker_heading: NAEEM
dialog: Hey, I play pretty good.
text: Roberta laughs.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to Naeem)
dialog: See how easy it is?
dialog: (to the class)
dialog: Maybe in the spring, we could have a
dialog: big concert for your families and
dialog: for the whole school.
dialog: (to the boy)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: NAEEM
dialog: Naeem.
text: Roberta writes in a notebook and we see that she's measuring
dialog: for violin sizes.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to class)
dialog: If you listen to me and do exactly
dialog: what I say, you're gonna sound
dialog: beautiful at the concert and you're
dialog: gonna be so proud of yourselves.
dialog: (to Naeem)
dialog: Good, Naeem. Your hand's staying
dialog: soft.
dialog: (to the class)
dialog: But if you don't listen to me, you'll
dialog: sound so bad that your own parents
dialog: will feel sick when they hear you.
dialog: They might even throw up.
text: ON THE KIDS, not used to a teacher speaking like that.
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: A funky apartment on the Upper West Side. Nick and Lexi are
text: both asleep in sleeping bags on top of a futon on the floor,
text: their suitcases nearby. Brian tiptoes past them, carrying
text: two glasses of champagne. He knocks on his office door.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA (O.S.)
dialog: Come in.
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Roberta's in a bathrobe and nightgown, some rollers in her
text: hair. She's tidying up her suitcase, etc., next to an old
dialog: couch that's been made up as a bed. Leftist political books
text: line a shelf above Brian's desk, including copies of his
scene_heading: own, TO HELL AND BACK: INTERVIEWS WITH VIETNAM VETS by BRIAN
text: TURNER. His desk is covered with files and books pertaining
text: to MIGRANT WORKERS. Brian enters.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (referring to champagne)
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It's a toast.
dialog: (giving her a glass,
dialog: holding his up)
dialog: To Roberta, who's made it through
dialog: her first week.
text: They clink glasses and drink.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I don't know, Brian. I'm hanging on
dialog: by a thread there. Out of fifty kids,
dialog: maybe six are listening to me.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Look at the progress. Didn't you say
dialog: no one was listening to you on Monday?
text: Roberta laughs.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I really appreciate all you've done
dialog: for us. And I promise -- this weekend
dialog: I'll start looking for a place.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: There's no rush.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No, we've put you out enough. You're
dialog: supposed to be writing, not
dialog: babysitting for us.
text: (crosses to his desk,
text: flips through his
dialog: Vietnam book)
dialog: I've started your book. It's very
dialog: powerful.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: Brian comes up behind her and starts to kiss her neck.
text: Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not
dialog: really happening.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: So what made you choose migrant
dialog: workers for your next book? I mean,
dialog: how do you know what to write about?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (kissing her neck)
text: I follow my gut, pay attention to
dialog: what I'm being drawn to...
text: Roberta's aroused, in spite of herself. She turns around and
text: faces him.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I've been waiting to do that since
text: Mr. Baines' orchestra class.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You didn't even notice me!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Sure I did. You used to ignore me
dialog: and it drove me wild.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You had at least five different
dialog: girlfriends.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It didn't mean I had the one I wanted.
text: He gives her a flirtatious smile, then takes out one of her
dialog: rollers.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're not a navy wife anymore...
text: He moves to takes out another roller and Roberta stops him.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Yes I am... legally.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: And is it a navy requirement that
dialog: you dress like it's the 1950's?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I do not!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (goading her)
dialog: Who did you vote for in the last
dialog: election?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What does that have to do with
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (hesitates, then)
dialog: I don't know. Charles filled out my
dialog: absentee ballot.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh my God -- it's even worse than I
dialog: thought!
dialog: (touching her hair)
dialog: Is this the same Roberta who got the
dialog: orchestra to strike until they gave
dialog: us new uniforms?
text: She laughs wistfully, then looks a little sad.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: That Roberta's not around anymore.
text: He pulls her towards him by the belt to her robe.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I don't believe that.
text: They kiss and it heats up quickly. Roberta pulls back.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I shouldn't.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Because?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: The boys --
speaker_heading: BRIAN
text: They're sleeping.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I know, but... I'm still married.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: And what's your husband doing right
dialog: now?
text: A few beats, and she moves towards him.
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Sun streams into the room as Roberta awakens in Brian's bed,
text: a look of afterglow on her face. She suddenly remembers where
text: she is, and quickly looks at the clock.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Oh shit -- the boys.
speaker_heading: BRIAN (O.S.)
text: They're still sleeping.
text: She turns, relieved, until she sees that Brian's packing a
dialog: suitcase.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Texas.
text: He dashes out. Roberta sits up, rattled by this news.
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Brian excitedly gathers papers and files scattered around
text: his electric typewriter.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA (O.S.)
dialog: What's in Texas?
text: He turns to see Roberta in the doorway.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Farm workers. I just got the call --
dialog: it came through -- my research grant!
dialog: It came through! Isn't that great?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Today?
text: He places items into a carry-on bag, packing at a rapid clip.
text: In contrast, Roberta seems to be moving in slow motion.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I've got a few families lined up
dialog: there, some in California --
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: How long will you be gone?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Two, three months.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What?
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Brian throws toiletries into a plastic bag. Roberta enters.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I thought... I just thought you were
dialog: gonna be around. And then last night --
text: He stops what he's doing and looks at her.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Whoa. Roberta -- last night was great
dialog: but did you think I was gonna marry
dialog: you in the morning?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No! Of course not.
dialog: We see in her face that part of her did think that.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: It's just that... we just got here
dialog: and we're barely... I don't even
dialog: know where to buy groceries.
text: Brian softens as he sees how vulnerable she is. He takes her
text: in his arms.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're gonna be fine. You have a
dialog: job, a place to stay, your kids have
dialog: a school to go to -- and there's a
text: D'Agostino's around the corner.
text: She attempts a smile.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Congratulations.
text: He kisses her forehead, then exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA, looking
text: hurt and frightened.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: Roberta rosins her bow, standing in front of ten kids --
text: third through fifth-grade -- who sit on the floor next to
text: their violin cases. The kids are Black and Latino, with a
text: couple of white faces. They're all talking and ignoring
text: Roberta except for NAEEM and GUADALUPE, a petite Mexican
text: girl with a long dark braid. [NOTE: We'll see other violin
dialog: students from time to time, but this is the class we'll follow
dialog: for Roberta's first year]
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: And what am I doing now?
speaker_heading: NAEEM/GUADALUPE
text: Rosining the bow.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Good. And what am I doing when I
dialog: turn this little screw?
dialog: (raising her voice)
dialog: Everyone stop talking. Right now!
text: The kids quiet down. Only Naeem raises his hand.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Naeem?
speaker_heading: NAEEM
text: Tightening the horse hair.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
text: (touches the heel of
dialog: the bow)
dialog: And what do we call this?
text: Again, only Naeem raises his hand. Roberta sees him but turns
text: to DE SEAN, who's talking to his neighbor.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: De Sean?
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What do we call this?
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: I wasn't here.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Yes you were but you weren't paying
dialog: attention! Do you want people to
dialog: think you're stupid?
text: This makes De Sean blush -- and it pisses him off.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: All right, Naeem -- tell them.
speaker_heading: NAEEM
dialog: It's called the frog.
text: Some kids giggle and joke about this. Roberta points to the
text: scroll of the violin.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Anyone remember what this is?
text: LUCY, the fidgety girl, snaps her fingers.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Lucy! Do you like people snapping
dialog: their fingers when you're talking?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Yeah!
text: The kids laugh. Roberta doesn't. She points to the scroll.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What is this called?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: The jeri curl?
text: Roberta laughs, even though she's trying to be tough.
scene_heading: INT. DENNIS' MUSIC CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Dennis's twenty students play recorder in rows of attached
text: theatre-style seats. Dennis sits at his desk, a METRONOME
text: ticking, and apathetically leads them in scales, using a red
text: pen as a baton. He keeps one eye on a stack of quizzes that
text: he's marking, stopping to circle mistakes with the pen.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
scene_heading: C-C-C-C, D-D-D-D, E-E-E-E...
text: ANGLE - Roberta stands in the hallway at the open door,
text: dismayed by Dennis' uninspired teaching. She enters and
text: crosses to Dennis, speaking quietly to him.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Excuse me -- sorry to interrupt --
text: The students immediately start to chatter.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: No talking!
text: He looks back at Roberta, annoyed by her intrusion.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm supposed to take kids out of
dialog: Miss Cooper's classroom for my ten
dialog: o'clock class -- there's nobody there.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Miss Cooper's students have phys ed
dialog: on Tuesdays.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: But you scheduled them for violin.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: You must have read the schedule wrong.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (trying to remain
dialog: polite)
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Well, I can't solve this problem for
dialog: you right now.
dialog: (nods to his class)
dialog: I'm trying to teach.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: So am I.
text: She exits.
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Lexi and Nick are in Brian's bed. Roberta's tucking in Lexi;
text: he holds a toy truck with Greek writing on it.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Can I bring a puppy for show and
dialog: tell tomorrow?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Honey, we don't have a puppy.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Daddy said we could get one when we
dialog: moved back to America.
text: Roberta looks at Nick, then turns back to Lexi.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: How about your truck? I'll bet you're
text: the only one in school with a truck
dialog: from Greece.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: When's Daddy coming back?
text: Roberta turns to Nick and tucks him in.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, he's still on his tour, so
dialog: we'll just have to see but... It
dialog: shouldn't be too much longer.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Is he gonna live with us and Brian?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No, honey. We're just staying at
text: Brian's house for a little while.
text: She turns back to Nick who looks worried. She kisses him.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Good night, sweetie.
text: She kisses Lexi, then reaches to turn off the lamp.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No! Leave it on.
text: Roberta nods, smiles at her sons, and exits.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: Nine children stand, violins under their right arms, bows
text: hanging down from their right hands, and try to position
text: their feet as Roberta addresses them.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Now take the right foot and put it
dialog: on a tile. Good. Now with the other
text: foot take a tiny step forward and
dialog: put it on a line. Try to make a box
dialog: with your feet --
text: She walks over to BENJAMIN, a white boy with glasses, and
text: corrects his feet. She sees Lucy dancing in place.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Lucy! Would you like to leave the
dialog: class right now?
text: Lucy nods, giggling. Roberta walks down the row of students.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You should feel very strong -- so
dialog: strong and balanced that if I wanted
dialog: to knock you over I couldn't.
text: She crosses to TANISHA, a sweet-natured Black girl with her
text: hair in tiny braids, and gently pushes her belly.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You see? If you're standing strong,
dialog: I can't even push you.
text: Roberta turns to De Sean, who's talking to JAMES, a pudgy
dialog: Black/Puerto Rican boy.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: De Sean! James! Quiet!
text: (as she crosses to
dialog: another student)
dialog: Does anyone know where Naeem is?
speaker_heading: TANISHA
dialog: I saw him this morning but he's not
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Yes, I know he's not here -- that's
dialog: why I'm asking.
text: She gently pushes Guadalupe's belly. The girl stumbles back.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: See how I pushed you? It means your
text: feet aren't centered.
text: Guadalupe tries to correct her feet. Roberta bends down to
text: help and sees that the little girl wears LEG BRACES under
text: her pants. Roberta stands and gestures to one of the boys.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Can you bring over a chair?
dialog: (to Guadalupe)
dialog: It's probably better for you to sit.
text: The boy brings the chair. Guadalupe sits, embarrassed.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
text: Roberta walks through a school yard filled with kids and
text: parents picking them up. She sees Naeem and crosses to him.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Where were you today, Naeem?
speaker_heading: NAEEM
dialog: I can't be in violin class anymore.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: NAEEM
dialog: My mother won't let me.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What?
text: NAEEM'S MOTHER, MRS. ADISA, steps INTO FRAME. She's an
text: attractive Black woman in a dress and head scarf made of
dialog: African fabric.
speaker_heading: MRS. ADISA
dialog: My son's got more important things
dialog: to do than learn dead white men's
dialog: music.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: They're gonna learn "Twinkle Twinkle
dialog: Little Star"!
speaker_heading: MRS. ADISA
dialog: How many Black classical composers
dialog: can you name? How many Black classical
dialog: violinists do you know?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: That doesn't mean it's the way it
dialog: should be. Naeem's learning to play
dialog: music -- and that makes him feel
dialog: good about himself. Why should it
dialog: matter who wrote it?
speaker_heading: NAEEM
dialog: Please, Mom? Can't I be in the class?
text: Mrs. Adisa puts a protective arm around her son, then
text: addresses Roberta.
speaker_heading: MRS. ADISA
dialog: Look. I've seen this before. You
dialog: white women come up here and think
dialog: you can rescue our poor inner city
dialog: children who never asked to be rescued
dialog: in the first place. No thank you.
text: She walks off with Naeem. He glances back at Roberta, then
text: turns away quickly. Roberta watches after them.
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Roberta attempts to read Brian's book, To Hell and Back:
text: Interviews with Vietnam Vets, but she's distracted. She
text: glances at her purse, then back to the book. She puts the
text: book down and dials the phone.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Brian Turner's room, please.
text: While she waits, she looks at Brian's picture on the book
text: jacket. There's no answer and she hangs up. She starts to
text: straighten the already clean room, then gets her purse, takes
text: out her wallet, and opens it to the plastic covered pictures.
scene_heading: INSERT - PICTURES
text: Charles in uniform; a studio shot of the boys when they were
text: 3 and 1; the whole family posed on the terrace of their home
text: in Greece, a view of the ocean behind them.
text: BACK TO ROBERTA
text: She's really depressed herself now.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
text: ALICE CROWLEY (50's), a no-nonsense Black teacher, shows her
text: fifth-graders a globe. She doesn't turn as Roberta enters
text: and crosses to her. In the b.g. we see ROBERTA'S STUDENTS
text: waiting in THE HALL.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: And which ocean is this?
text: Kids simultaneously yell out "ATLANTIC" and "PACIFIC."
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Excuse me... I'm here for the violin
dialog: students.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (icy)
dialog: You're late.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Just a couple of minutes -- I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: They're having a lesson now.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: But this is when they have violin
dialog: class!
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: That's not my problem.
text: Roberta's reluctant to argue in front of the kids; she exits.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
text: Lots of noise and chaos as kids run wild during lunch recess.
text: Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I thought all the teachers agreed to
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: In theory.
dialog: (to a student)
dialog: Adam! I want you in my office right
dialog: after lunch, you understand?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What'd I do?
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Think about it!
dialog: (to Roberta)
dialog: Whenever you pull kids out, it's a
dialog: disruption, plus it's extra work for
dialog: the teacher 'cause they have to fill
dialog: the kids in on what they missed.
dialog: Some teachers resent it.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, can't you talk to them?
text: Janet stops walking and pulls a box cutter out of her pocket.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: I took this off a second-grader this
dialog: morning. I'll help you Roberta --
dialog: but I can't hold your hand here.
text: Janet starts to walk away, then turns.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: A word of advice? When you're picking
dialog: up your students, go to Alice's
dialog: classroom first.
text: Roberta stands there as Janet walks on ahead.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: The nine children hold their violins in position as Roberta
text: addresses them.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: So pretend you're driving a car and
dialog: I'm the policeman and I say STOP!
text: Thumb up, fingers straight up, flat
dialog: palm. Now you be policemen, but turn
dialog: your hand and make it say stop to
dialog: yourself.
text: ON THE CHILDREN, attempting this. She walks around and helps.
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: You're under arrest.
text: Some kids crack up and start joking and chatting.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Knock it off, De Sean!
dialog: (to all)
dialog: If you kids can't take this seriously,
dialog: I don't want you here. I'm teaching
dialog: you a difficult instrument because I
dialog: respect you and have faith that you
dialog: can learn it. But none of that matters
dialog: if you don't have respect for
dialog: yourself.
text: Some of the children think about what she's saying. A couple,
text: uncomfortable with the intensity, hold back giggles.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Now turn your wrist so it's flat
dialog: against the fingerboard, and that's
dialog: how you'll set up your hand...
text: Roberta sees Guadalupe struggling.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Guadalupe! You've got the violin in
dialog: the wrong hand! How did that happen?
text: Embarrassed, Guadalupe corrects her position.
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: At the small kitchen table, Nick does homework and Lexi puts
text: stickers in a sticker book. Roberta's cooking dinner; she
text: grabs a potholder and checks on a bubbling lasagna in the
text: oven. The PHONE RINGS and she answers it.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: CHARLES (O.S.)
dialog: Hello, Bobbi.
text: Her face falls as she hears the voice. She holds onto the
text: counter to steady herself.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: CHARLES (O.S.)
dialog: (calm, detached)
dialog: I'm back in the States. I'm at my
dialog: parents.
text: Roberta closes the oven and gathers her courage.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Are you still with her?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: CHARLES (O.S.)
dialog: No.
text: We watch Roberta's body collapse into a sense of overwhelming
text: relief. FOLLOW HER as she steps into THE HALLWAY, then
dialog: stretches the phone into:
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: She half-closes the door, leans against the sink and starts
dialog: to cry.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (through tears)
dialog: We've missed you so much, Charles.
dialog: The boys... they can't wait for you
dialog: to come home... I know we'll have a
dialog: lot to work out and it won't be easy
dialog: right away, but we're gonna get
dialog: through this, you know? We're a family
dialog: and we belong together and --
speaker_heading: CHARLES (O.S.)
dialog: (more emotive than
dialog: before)
dialog: Bobbi -- stop, O.K.? Just stop.
text: Roberta looks as if she's been slapped. A beat.
speaker_heading: CHARLES (O.S.)
dialog: I want a divorce.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: But you said... you and Lana... you
dialog: said it was over.
speaker_heading: CHARLES (O.S.)
dialog: It is.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's over between us too, Bobbi.
text: HOLD ON ROBERTA, devastated. ANGLE on NICK, watching her
text: through the door.
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S HOTEL ROOM, TEXAS - NIGHT
text: Brian's on the phone with Roberta. He's in a t-shirt and
text: sweats, and his papers are scattered on the bed.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA (O.S.)
dialog: He wouldn't even talk about it! No
dialog: explanations, no discussion...
speaker_heading: INTERCUT
text: Roberta in Brian's living room. She's extremely agitated and
text: her eyes are puffy from crying.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I can't believe you were still holding
dialog: out hope. The guy hasn't called you
dialog: or the kids in three months -- I
dialog: thought you'd moved on.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I never said that.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No? Maybe not with words.
text: This embarrasses her, then pisses her off.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You know what? I shouldn't have called
dialog: you. This was a mistake.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No, no -- I'm sorry. Look, I know it
dialog: hurts, but you're gonna get through
dialog: this, Roberta -- you will.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm moving back to my Mom's.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What? You're gonna quit teaching in
dialog: the middle of the term?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I don't fit in there -- I'm not making
dialog: any progress with the kids...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What are you gonna tell Janet --
dialog: your husband left you and nothing
dialog: else matters?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I don't know yet.
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Roberta lies awake on the futon, heartbroken.
scene_heading: INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Roberta stands and watches Nick and Lexi sleep. She lies
text: down beside them and closes her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
text: Roberta walks through crowds of kids towards Janet who's in
text: the middle of confronting a boy student. Janet holds a FIFTY-
text: DOLLAR BILL. Roberta hangs back and waits for a chance to
dialog: speak.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: My mother gave it to me.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Why would she give you fifty dollars?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: To buy breakfast.
text: Janet gives him a stern look.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Do you know how hard your mother
dialog: works? Do you think it's right for
dialog: you steal from her?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: I didn't!
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Well let's go call her right now and
dialog: ask her.
text: As Janet turns to walk off, Roberta crosses to her.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I need to speak to you. It's
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: It'll have to wait.
dialog: (to the boy)
dialog: Come on. In my office.
text: Roberta watches as Janet dashes off with the boy in tow.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: Guadalupe sits on a chair in the empty room, struggling to
text: set up her violin. Roberta enters, surprised to see her.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Guadalupe? What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: GUADALUPE
dialog: I can't get the stop sign.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Honey, your teacher's probably looking
dialog: for you.
text: Guadalupe sighs, then hands Roberta the violin.
speaker_heading: GUADALUPE
dialog: I can't come anymore. It's too hard.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: The violin is hard for everyone.
speaker_heading: GUADALUPE
dialog: But everyone else is better than me.
dialog: I'll always be slow.
text: Roberta looks at her sadly and puts the violin in its case.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Did you ever hear of Itzhak Perlman?
speaker_heading: GUADALUPE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: He's one of the greatest violinists
dialog: in the world, and he has problems
text: with his legs too. He walks with two
dialog: canes -- but he still makes the most
text: beautiful music.
speaker_heading: GUADALUPE
dialog: And he sits down when he plays?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: He has to.
dialog: Guadalupe takes this in.
speaker_heading: GUADALUPE
dialog: He was your student?
text: Roberta laughs.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No. But if he was, I'd tell him the
dialog: same thing I'm telling you. You
dialog: shouldn't quit something just because
dialog: it's hard.
speaker_heading: GUADALUPE
dialog: But I can't stand strong.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Standing strong doesn't only mean
dialog: using your legs. You can stand strong
text: on the inside too.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Know what I mean?
text: Guadalupe nods. Roberta holds out the violin case. Guadalupe
text: lunges forward and hugs her around the waist. Roberta
text: awkwardly accepts the hug, startled and touched by it, and
text: strokes the girl's hair. Guadalupe lets go, takes the violin
text: and exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA as she absorbs what just happened.
text: JANET pokes her head into the room.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: You wanted to speak to me?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Oh. Umm -- that's O.K. It's taken
dialog: care of.
text: Janet looks at her curiously, then exits.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - EAST HARLEM - DAY
text: Roberta walks around an empty, rundown apartment, her
text: expression somber. Crayon markings on the walls, cigarette
text: burns on the floors, a filthy bathroom and kitchen. An older
text: Puerto Rican woman stands back as Roberta inspects the place.
text: Roberta wipes grease off one of the windows.
speaker_heading: LANDLADY
dialog: Is just for you and your boys?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LANDLADY
dialog: No husband? No boyfriend?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL YARD - LUNCH RECESS - DAY
text: Roberta enters the yard from inside the school. It's filled
text: with kids playing, including Nick and Lexi. She waves to
text: them and Lexi runs up to her, carrying a piece of artwork.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Look what I made you, Mommy!
text: He gives her a tempera PAINTING of a man's face, the
text: background decorated with glued-on macaroni. It says DADDY.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (covering her
dialog: discomfort)
dialog: That is so beautiful!
text: He runs off. Roberta exhales, sits down alone on a bench and
text: takes out her lunch. She smiles at ALICE CROWLEY and another
text: TEACHER but they cross to another bench. ISABEL VASQUEZ (25)
text: approaches, a lively Puerto Rican woman with a strong New
dialog: York accent.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Whatsa matter -- you got cooties?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Apparently.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: I'll take my chances.
dialog: (extends a hand)
dialog: Isabel Vasquez. Second grade.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Roberta Demetras. I'm the --
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Violin teacher. I know.
text: She sits down beside Roberta, takes out her lunch.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Is it my imagination, or does everyone
dialog: hate me?
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: It's hard to fit in when you're doing
dialog: a special program. People figure
dialog: you're not gonna be here very long,
dialog: so why make the effort?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It may take a while for folks to
dialog: warm up, but nobody hates you.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: What about Alice Crowley?
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: A) she thinks the violin's a waste
dialog: of time... and B) -- she's a bitch.
text: Roberta laughs.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: And then there's Dennis.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: The Music Man. You've had the bodacity
dialog: to threaten his private little empire --
dialog: not to mention the fact that you
dialog: messed up his sacred scheduling chart.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: How come you're being nice to me?
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Ulterior motives. I want my daughter
dialog: in your class next year.
text: Roberta smiles.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: If I'm here next year.

text: LEXI'S PAINTING is on the wall, along with a crayon drawing
text: of himself, Roberta, and Nick in front of a house.
text: ANGLE - ROBERTA looks out the window. She's gotten some used
text: furniture, cleaned the place, and it's less depressing.
text: ROBERTA'S POV OUT THE WINDOW
text: On the street below, three prostitutes stand at the corner.
text: Two men sit on a stoop, smoking a joint, and in a parked
text: car, three men seem to be making a drug deal. One of the
text: buildings on the street is burned out, missing a front door.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Nick, in his pajamas, enters and crosses to his mother. She
text: smiles at him and they both look out the window.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: In Greece, we could see the ocean.
dialog: Remember?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I remember. And the fishing boats...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And the octopuses.
text: Roberta smiles and puts her arm around him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Is Daddy coming here soon?
text: Roberta tenses up.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, that's something I've been
dialog: wanting to talk to you about. Daddy's
dialog: not gonna live with us anymore. You
dialog: and Lexi will have special times
dialog: when you stay with him, like at
dialog: Christmas.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Can you tell the birthday story?
text: Roberta looks at him, concerned that he's not responding to
dialog: her news.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Don't you want to talk about what I
dialog: told you?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I want to hear the birthday story.
text: A beat as she contemplates whether to push or not, then:
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: It was the day of Grandpa's birthday,
dialog: and I was sad because he had died a
dialog: few months back.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: But you knew I'd be born that day.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: So I packed a bag and got all ready --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And Daddy laughed.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I said, "It's my father's birthday,
dialog: and the baby's gonna be born today."
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: He didn't believe you. But I was
text: born. The same day as Grandpa.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: It was a happy day.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Was Daddy happy too?
text: She looks at him, taken aback by the question.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Of course he was.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Then why is he leaving me?
text: Roberta, overcome with emotion, can barely answer.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: He's not leaving you, Nick. He loves
dialog: you and Lexi very much.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Then why can't he live here?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: It's very hard to explain... Sometimes
dialog: things happen between grown-ups...
dialog: and they just can't be together.
text: The CAMERA moves behind them as they continue to look out
text: the window, and we see Nick move away from his mother.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: The kids play "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and they sound
text: awful. Roberta looks disgusted as she leads them.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Slow bows! Slow bows! Don't squeeze!
dialog: Stop! Everybody stop!
dialog: (to De Sean)
dialog: How much did you practice this week?
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: My asthma -- it was very bad and I
dialog: had to go to the hospital.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Again? You told me you went to the
dialog: hospital last week.
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: Oh yeah. Maybe it was last week.
text: Roberta rolls her eyes, then turns to Lucy.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Lucy -- you sounded the worst of
dialog: all. Have you practiced?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Why not? You can't be in this class
dialog: if you don't practice!
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: My grandma got mugged.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Oh. I'm sorry. Is she O.K.?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: She died.
text: Roberta stands there, sobered.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm really sorry, Lucy.
dialog: (tries to get her
dialog: bearings)
dialog: Just do the best you can.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
text: A group of kids stand together with their violins and chat.
text: Roberta exits the building and they greet her. She waves
text: back, but she's clearly still upset by her interaction with
text: Lucy. She sees Naeem and his mother and approaches them.
speaker_heading: NAEEM
dialog: Hi, Roberta.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Hi, Naeem. Can I talk to your mom
dialog: for a minute?
text: Naeem nods and moves off.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Look, I didn't come up here to rescue
dialog: anybody. I'm a single mother and I
dialog: needed a job. And I know you think
dialog: you're protecting your son, but you're
dialog: not. I mean, what if Arthur Ashe's
dialog: mother had stopped him from playing
dialog: tennis because it's a "white man's
dialog: game"?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The important thing is that when
text: Naeem plays music, his whole face
dialog: lights up. You should see him.
text: Mrs. Adisa takes this in. Roberta exits. Mrs. Adisa looks
text: for Naeem and sees him watching the violin students, longing
text: to be among them. She watches her son with compassion.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY
text: Roberta and the boys shop in a colorful outdoor produce market
text: in their neighborhood.
text: The boys suddenly rush over to A MAN sitting on the ground
text: with mixed-breed PUPPIES in a cardboard box. The boys pet
text: them excitedly. Roberta watches her sons; they're happier
dialog: than she's seen them in ages.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: A brown puppy is jumping all over Nick and Lexi who laugh
text: delightedly. Roberta is putting down newspapers.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: We all have to take turns cleaning

text: The boys are oblivious to her -- they're in heaven.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to herself)

speaker_heading: ROBERTA

dialog: (to a white girl with
dialog: pigtails)
dialog: Wrong string, Becky! We've done this
dialog: fourteen times! And look at your
dialog: nails! You're supposed to cut them
dialog: for violin class! O.K, everybody
dialog: stop! It sounds horrible! I can't
dialog: believe how bad it sounds!
text: They stop playing. Tanisha raises her hand.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Is this an important question,
dialog: Tanisha?
text: Tanisha nods.
speaker_heading: TANISHA
dialog: Do you have two of those skirts?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TANISHA
dialog: You wore a skirt just like it on
dialog: Monday.
text: Some of the kids crack up.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You know, Tanisha -- I don't think
dialog: that's such an important question.
dialog: (to class)
dialog: O.K. Let's try --
text: The door opens and Naeem enters with Mrs. Adisa. Roberta
text: crosses to them.
speaker_heading: MRS. ADISA
dialog: Naeem and I were wondering if he
dialog: could still be in the class.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'd love that.
dialog: (to Naeem)
dialog: You'll have a lot of catching up to
dialog: do. You think you can work that hard?
speaker_heading: NAEEM
dialog: Yeah, I can.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Maybe we can also arrange some private
dialog: lessons at my house.
speaker_heading: MRS. ADISA
dialog: I wouldn't have the money for that.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: That's O.K.
dialog: (to Naeem)
dialog: Why don't you go grab one of my spare
dialog: violins?
text: Naeem happily runs to the extra violins at the front of the
text: room; Mrs. Adisa nods to Roberta with a look of gratitude,
text: then exits. Roberta crosses back to the front of the room.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to class)
dialog: Let's try it again.
text: They begin again, and we see Naeem take out a violin and
text: join in. As they play, Roberta's ears perk up at something
text: she's hearing. She crosses to Lucy.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What are you playing?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Twinkle.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to class)
dialog: Everyone stop!
dialog: (to Lucy)
dialog: Let me hear.
text: Lucy hesitates, thinking she's in trouble. She plays a jazz
text: variation of the song. Roberta smiles.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Did someone teach you that?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: No. I made it up.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: That's really great, Lucy. I'm proud
dialog: of you.
text: Lucy beams.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to class)
dialog: All of you -- try it.
text: The class plays Lucy's jazz variation and Naeem happily joins
dialog: in.
scene_heading: INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - DAY
text: Roberta sits opposite Janet and MRS. LAMB, a white woman in
dialog: her 30's.
speaker_heading: MRS. LAMB
dialog: You're shouting at them. All the
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Not all the time. But if they don't
dialog: listen --
speaker_heading: MRS. LAMB
dialog: Didn't you tell them that they were
dialog: making their parents sick?
text: Janet raises her eyebrows at this.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: That wasn't exactly what I said --
speaker_heading: MRS. LAMB
dialog: I'm raising Becky in a supportive
dialog: atmosphere. I don't send her to school
dialog: to be abused.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm just trying to discipline them.
dialog: If they're gonna learn an instrument,
dialog: they need to take it seriously --
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: I think what Mrs. Lamb is trying to
dialog: say, Roberta, is that you're a little
dialog: too harsh. I'm sure you might be
dialog: able to soften some of your comments
dialog: to the children?
text: She gives Roberta a long hard look. Roberta nods.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: Roberta listens to the students play "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" --
text: badly. They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, that was... that was pretty
dialog: good... that wasn't too bad...
text: They look at her in disbelief, then look at each other.
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: It wasn't? I thought we stunk.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I wouldn't put it that way... You
dialog: all just need to practice a bit more.
dialog: (to James)
dialog: James, have you practiced this week?
text: The boy nervously shakes his head no.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Can you please try a little harder
dialog: for next week?
text: James nods. The kids are baffled by her politeness.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Good. Just do the best you can.
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: Why you acting like that?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Don't you want a nice teacher?
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: I already got nice teachers. You
dialog: added some variety.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Yeah. We like you better the way you
dialog: used to be.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (to Becky)
dialog: What about you, Becky?
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Yeah. This is even worse. You're
dialog: acting weird now.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, then -- I take it back. You
text: all stunk.
text: The kids laugh.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: But don't tell your parents I said
dialog: so!
text: The kids laugh again.
scene_heading: INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DEPARTURE GATE - DAY
text: Christmas MUZAK plays in the b.g. as Roberta kisses and hugs
text: Lexi and Nick goodbye. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT stands nearby.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Can't you come with us? Please?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Honey, I told you. This is Daddy's
dialog: special time with you.
text: Lexi looks upset; Nick is stoic. Roberta hugs them one last
text: time. The FLIGHT ATTENDANT steps forward.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: I'll take good care of them.
text: The FLIGHT ATTENDANT escorts them into the jet way. Roberta
text: holds back tears as they get further away from her. At the
text: last moment, Lexi turns and waves; Nick does not. Roberta
text: waves, tears starting to fall, and the boys disappear from
text: sight. She observes all the families travelling together,
text: and feels like the loneliest person in the airport.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Roberta enters her apartment, back from the airport, and
text: double-locks the door behind her. You can see on her face
text: that she's dreading the emptiness. She crosses to a small
text: Christmas tree, obviously decorated by her and the boys, and
text: plugs in the tiny blinking lights. It's not exactly
text: Rockefeller Center. She turns on the T.V., playing IT'S A
scene_heading: WONDERFUL LIFE.
text: She crosses to the kitchen, then returns with a carton of
text: eggnog, a glass, and a bottle of rum. She sits down on the
text: couch, pours herself some eggnog, adds rum, adds more rum,
text: goes back into the kitchen, returns with nutmeg, sprinkles
text: some on top, then drinks. She sighs, glancing miserably at
text: the tree and the T.V. Pathetic. She couldn't look any less
text: festive if she tried. There's a KNOCK on the DOOR.
text: Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: BRIAN (O.S.)
dialog: Santa Claus.
text: She looks through the peephole, then quickly unlocks the
text: door and opens it, revealing BRIAN, giving her a big smile.
text: He looks sexy as hell (even with a silly lit-up Santa Claus
text: pin on his leather jacket), and he holds a long-stemmed red
text: rose in one hand, and a Christmas present in the other.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm back.
text: Roberta's thrilled and relieved to see him. She embraces
text: him, and they kiss passionately.
scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (TIME CUT - TWO MONTHS LATER)
text: CLOSE ON plaster walls being knocked down with sledgehammers.
text: REVEAL Brian, Roberta, and a couple of workmen knocking down
text: the walls in an old brownstone.
scene_heading: EXT. BROWNSTONE - EAST HARLEM - THE SAME DAY
text: A mild winter day. Roberta, covered with plaster dust and
text: overheated from working, leans against a car and drinks a
text: beer. The three-story brick building has some graffiti on it
text: and is badly in need of a paint job; there are a few broken
text: windows, and the front stairs need repairing. WORKMEN file
text: in and out. We can see from the STREET SIGNS that we're on
text: 118th STREET, a few houses off FIRST AVENUE.
text: Brian (also dust-covered), Nick and Lexi toss around a
text: football. LAWRENCE (6), a Black boy who lives next door,
text: joins them. Brian crosses to Roberta, sweaty and out of
text: breath. He takes a swig of her beer.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: O.K., enough goofing off -- back to
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You trying to kill me?
text: She laughs and they kiss.
text: ASSUNTA comes up the street with a bag of take-out food. She
text: casts a dubious glance at the lovers.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: I was the only person in the whole
text: coffee shop not speaking Spanish.
text: Roberta rolls her eyes. O.S. a car BACKFIRES.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: You hear that? Gunshots! How you
dialog: gonna live here by yourself?
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Boys, come eat!
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I work in this neighborhood, Mama. I
dialog: want to live here.
text: The boys approach and Assunta hands them sandwiches. Lawrence
text: hangs back. Assunta calls to him.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Lawrence.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: You hungry, Lawrence?
text: Lawrence nods and she hands him a sandwich. Roberta smiles
text: at her mother's gesture. The kids move off to Lawrence's
text: front steps and Assunta gives Roberta and Brian sandwiches.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: Why did you let her buy this house?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Hey, your daughter does what she
dialog: wants -- or haven't you noticed?
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: I've noticed.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Robert washes dishes and Assunta dries. The leftovers from
text: an Italian dinner are on the counter.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: I still don't understand the rush.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Having my own place will make me
dialog: feel like I'm really starting my
dialog: life again.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: But if you invested your divorce
dialog: settlement, you could buy something
dialog: nice someday. It's bad enough that
dialog: you've been renting in this
dialog: neighborhood, but to lock yourself
dialog: into a mortgage --
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: Mama, please. Just stop!
text: Assunta backs off. Roberta feels guilty and moves to her.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Don't worry, O.K.? Besides, if things
dialog: keep going well, I'm sure eventually
dialog: Brian will move in with us.
text: A few beats.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: How much do you know about this man?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Brian's a good person, he's helped
dialog: me a lot, he's great with the boys --
dialog: since he got back to town, it's been
dialog: really sweet.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: (with an attitude)
dialog: And how long has he been back?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Two months.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: That's not very long. Don't make the
dialog: same mistake twice, Bert. You barely
dialog: knew Charles when you married him.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: I don't get it -- you're ragging on
dialog: me about buying the house -- I would
dialog: think you'd want Brian to live with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: Not if he's the wrong person.
text: Roberta locks her jaw, not wanting to believe that she's
dialog: right.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: The kids play "Allegro," Roberta leading them.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Get ready, now -- we're coming up to
dialog: the fermata...
text: They reach a certain note, then pause.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Hold... Hold... Don't anybody move.
dialog: Now at the Spring Concert, the
dialog: audience is gonna be dying for that
dialog: next note -- but we'll make them
dialog: wait. As a matter of fact, I think
dialog: I'll go grab a cup of coffee.
text: She starts for the door and the kids moan and groan: "Come
text: on, Roberta!" "Roberta, get back here!" She smiles.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, O.K. But you have to promise
dialog: you'll all start together.
text: She nods. They begin again -- all at different times.
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: Man. We'll never get that right.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: That's not a very nice thing to say
dialog: about your classmates.
dialog: (to class)
dialog: How many people think they can get
dialog: it right by the concert?
text: All the kids raise their hands. De Sean looks around,
text: embarrassed, then raises his too. Roberta smiles.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Brian and Roberta finish making love on the futon. They lie
text: in each other's arms, still breathing heavily.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I love you.
text: Brian makes a sound that's either panting or laughing.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Did you just laugh?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm sorry. It's just...
text: Roberta looks at him, offended.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Why do people feel like the minute
dialog: something's going great, they gotta
dialog: name it?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Once you name something, you snuff
text: the life out of it.
text: She disentangles from him.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Jesus, Brian. Do you still get away
dialog: with that crap? It's not the Sixties
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, maybe if you'd actually gone
dialog: through the Sixties, you'd know what
dialog: I'm talking about.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Fine! We won't name it, we won't
dialog: talk about it, we'll act like we
dialog: have no feelings for each other
dialog: whatsoever!
text: She angrily turns on her side with her back to him. Brian
text: regrets hurting her and moves to her, kissing her shoulder.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm being an asshole.
dialog: (sweetly teasing)
dialog: You can say you love me if you want.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Forget it. I changed my mind.
text: He laughs and coaxes her to kiss him -- a temporary truce.
scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY
text: ERNIE (70's), a rickety Black man in work boots, looks baffled
text: by a tangled mess of wires protruding from a wall. Roberta
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: How's it coming, Ernie?
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Well, if I could just remember what
dialog: I did here yesterday, I'd be moving
dialog: a whole lot faster.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You look real pretty today, honey.
text: Brian overhears, rolls his eyes and pulls her aside.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're crazy. Why did you hire him?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: He needed a job. Besides, he's wired
dialog: all of East Harlem.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: When? Fifty years ago?
text: Brian sighs and walks off into another room. Two MEN carry
text: in large panels of sheetrock with old WALLPAPER on it.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Why is there wallpaper on it?
speaker_heading: MAN #1
dialog: That's how it comes.
text: They lean the panels against a wall. Roberta turns to Ernie.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Yep, that's how it comes now.
text: The guys quickly exit. Brian re-enters and sees the panels.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What the hell is this?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Sheetrock.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You've gotta be kidding. Those ex-
dialog: cons you hired ripped this off --
dialog: and you too!
text: Roberta feels stupid but doesn't want to show it.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Look -- this house is taking every
dialog: penny of my settlement. I can't afford
dialog: fancy union workers!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (throwing up his hands)
dialog: Fine. Do it your way.
text: He stomps off. ANOTHER ANGLE - Nick watches them fight and
text: looks distressed.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
text: Lots of screaming and commotion as the kids crowd around a
text: fight in progress. As we move through the crowd we see that
text: NICK's in a fight with another boy; Nick's nose is bleeding
text: and he has the boy in a headlock. TWO TEACHERS run over to
dialog: break it up.
scene_heading: INT. AREA OUTSIDE JANET'S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Have you noticed your son lately?
text: He's tied up in knots and he needs

speaker_heading: JANET

scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Roberta plays "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" with Guadalupe, De Sean,

text: plays along with them. Nick enters from the kitchen, eating

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to students)
dialog: Keep playing, guys.

dialog: It's my house! They don't live here --
dialog: I do!
speaker_heading: ROBERTA

dialog: Nick honey -- the kids are real

dialog: You could probably give them some
dialog: pointers.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't feel like it.

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I said no.

scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
text: Brian, Nick and Lexi laugh as they play frisbee alongside a

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Good catch Nick!
text: Nick throws it back to Brian and it lands in the WATER.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (mock sternly)
dialog: Uh-oh. You know what that means?
text: He stalks towards Nick menacingly, picks him up and pretends
text: he's going to throw him into the water. Nick laughs
text: hysterically.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (through laughter)
dialog: Don't! Don't throw me in!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Whatsa matter? Afraid of a little
dialog: water? The ducks aren't afraid! Are

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Don't! Don't throw me!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Looks like you got yourself a chicken,

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm not a chicken!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well then you must be a duck!

speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Throw me in the water, Brian! Do it

dialog: He misses his dad. I'm just a
dialog: surrogate.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No -- I think Nick really likes you.
dialog: (taking his arm)
dialog: You know... we're all hoping you'll
dialog: move into the new house with us.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Whoa. Can we just slow down here a
dialog: minute? It's too much like getting
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What's so bad about that?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That kind of commitment just isn't
dialog: realistic. I mean, how can we know
dialog: that you and I will even be able to
dialog: stand each other in five years?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, we don't. But if two people
dialog: care about each other, they take a
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: And look what happened to you and
dialog: Charles.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm not talking about Charles. I'm
dialog: talking about us.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Look, Roberta. Marriage is based on
dialog: a belief that one person can
dialog: completely meet another person's
dialog: needs. I just don't buy that.
text: This is making her nervous. She looks at him, afraid of what
dialog: he might be saying.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: What are you saying? If there's some
dialog: need you have that I don't meet,
dialog: you'd go and get it "met" by someone
dialog: else?
text: He heaves a sigh of frustration, not wanting to answer the
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm saying that it's the 80's and
dialog: it's a fantasy to think of marriage
dialog: lasting these days. One out of two
dialog: marriages ends in divorce!
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You didn't answer my question.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If I don't meet all your needs, and
dialog: we're in a committed relationship --
dialog: forget marriage for a minute; I'm
dialog: just talking about a relationship --
dialog: would you go to someone else?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: In theory, yes.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: In theory.
text: Roberta looks very disheartened. Brian feels badly.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Roberta, we've got something good
dialog: right now -- that's the important
dialog: thing. Let's just keep it that way,
dialog: O.K.?
text: He pulls her to him, kissing her neck, but she pulls away
text: from him. ON NICK, observing with an anxious expression.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: NICK (O.S.)
dialog: (whining)
dialog: Why can't he?
text: Roberta looks distressed by her talk with Brian as she and
text: the boys enter, back from the park.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: He just can't, O.K.? Brian's at his
dialog: house tonight, and we're at ours.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well then I wanna go to his house.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Enough, Nick. Now why don't you and
dialog: your brother practice while I make
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't feel like practicing.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well do it anyway.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I wanna go to Brian's!
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Stop whining, and get your violin.
text: Nick stomps off to get his violin. Lexi follows. Roberta
text: puts down her bag and takes off her coat. While Lexi sets up
text: his violin, Nick opens his violin case, takes out the violin
text: and angrily starts playing, loudly and roughly.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The problem with you is you're mean
dialog: to everybody and then they don't
dialog: want to be with you!
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I've heard just about enough from
dialog: you, young man. Now set your violin
text: up properly and start practicing.
text: Nick THROWS the violin against the floor. Roberta's
text: speechless.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I hate the violin!
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You pick that violin up right now
dialog: and don't you ever ever --
text: Nick picks up the violin and THROWS the violin down even
text: harder, then YELLS at Roberta before she can even respond.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's all your fault! You made Daddy
dialog: leave and you're gonna make Brian
dialog: leave too! You're gonna be all alone
dialog: and I'll have to take care of you!
text: Roberta is stunned. The anger drains out of her as she
text: suddenly sees what this is all about.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Nick -- you don't have to take care
dialog: of me.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Then who's going to?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'll take care of myself -- and I'll
dialog: take care of you and Lexi. I promise.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You didn't try hard enough. You made
dialog: Daddy leave us.
text: This hits her in the solar plexus. Her hurt and vulnerability
text: start to pour out.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: That's not true. I begged him not to
text: leave, but he didn't listen.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Why not?
text: Roberta hesitates, but knows she has to tell them the truth.
text: She addresses both boys.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Your father met someone he liked
dialog: more than Mommy, and then --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Who?
text: Roberta swallows, shocked to hear him ask this. She can hardly
dialog: answer him.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Lana. Remember our friends Lana and
dialog: Tom?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Is he gonna marry her now?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No, but he's not coming back... to
dialog: me.
text: Nick and Lexi look very upset, not only from hearing the
text: finality in her words, but from seeing their mother's pain.
text: Roberta moves closer to them.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'll take care of you, Nick. You
dialog: too, Lexi. I promise. I'm not going
dialog: anywhere. We're still a family.
text: Nick starts crying. Roberta takes him in her arms. Lexi starts
text: to cry and Roberta holds him too.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (softly, to both)
dialog: I promise.
scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY
text: Ernie's radio plays a BLUES SONG. The BRICK WORKERS radio

speaker_heading: PAINTER

speaker_heading: ROBERTA

speaker_heading: PAINTER

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're an idiot! I told you -- you

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You're right. I'm an idiot.
text: She crosses to Ernie and shakes him.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Wake up, Ernie.
text: He looks at her groggily.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You're fired.
text: She crosses to the brick workers.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You're fired.
text: She crosses to the painters.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You're fired.

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's more like it.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You're fired too.
text: Brian laughs.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No, Brian. I mean it. I need to be
dialog: with a man who can make a commitment
dialog: to me. I need that, and my sons need
dialog: that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So can you?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (hesitates, then)
dialog: Roberta --
text: His tone and expression tell her the words are not
dialog: forthcoming.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Get out.
text: He looks at her, shocked by her toughness, but knows he can't

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
text: Stands in the aisle, leading the students and playing violin.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: The fifty fifth-grade students play the "Twinkle" variations.

text: husband, watching Becky in amazement; ISABEL and her daughter
text: sitting with ASSUNTA, NICK and LEXI; JANET, impressed as

text: the jazz variation of "Twinkle," a WOMAN elbows her husband:
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: That's the one Lucy wrote!
text: The CAMERA returns to the children and captures their own
text: pride in their playing, including LUCY, who smiles as she
text: hears her song played by fifty.
scene_heading: THE CONCERT - TIME DISSOLVE
text: The students are now playing "Allegro," and they reach the
text: fermata. They hold their positions in silence and the audience
text: watches in anticipation. Roberta cues them and they play the
text: next note in perfect unison. An involuntary smile lights on
text: DE SEAN's face. They finish the song, the audience applauds,
text: and Roberta turns to face them.
text: She lights up when she sees how thrilled Janet looks, and
text: Janet in turn raises her hands higher as she applauds Roberta.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CPE 1 - DAY - ESTABLISHING - TIME CUT (1998)

text: ONLY THE STRONG SHALL SURVIVE.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Roberta stands in front of a classroom of twenty cute first-
text: graders -- mostly Black and Latino, a few white -- sitting
text: on the floor, chatting excitedly. Even though Roberta's ten
text: years older, she seems more youthful; her wavy hair is loose
text: over her shoulders, her clothing's casual and artistic. Beside
text: her is Janet, her hair flecked with gray, and Dennis, who
text: looks pretty much the same. The classroom teacher is ISABEL,
text: a little older, a little tougher.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: C'mon everybody, settle down -- Janet
dialog: wants to talk to you.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Today's a very special day because
dialog: we're starting the tenth year of the
dialog: East Harlem Violin Program. This is
dialog: a wonderful opportunity for you, so
dialog: I want you to talk to your parents
dialog: about whether you'd like to try this.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: My daughter took violin with Roberta
dialog: when she was your age, and now she's
dialog: in high school and she still talks
dialog: about how much she loved it.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Janet and I started this program
dialog: because we knew how much you kids
dialog: could benefit from it.
text: CUTAWAY to Roberta and Janet exchanging glances over Dennis
dialog: taking credit for the program.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: You should know, however, that the
dialog: violin is a difficult instrument.
text: JUSTIN, a Black boy with attitude, raises his hand. He always
text: wears a puffy red, yellow and green crocheted beret. Isabel
text: nods to him.
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: Who's that lady in the back?
scene_heading: ANGLE - DOROTHEA (Doro-taya) VAN HAUFTEN (40's), an elegant,

speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Justin -- sshh!
speaker_heading: JANET
text: -- and she's taking pictures of

speaker_heading: ISABEL

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: After your parents sign your

dialog: in a sack, and I'll pick fifty names
dialog: from each school.
text: ANGLE - Ramon listens intently with his fingers crossed.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: So everyone bring in your slips by
dialog: Friday, and I'll come back and tell
dialog: you who's in violin class.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Remember, she's just picking names
dialog: from a hat. It doesn't mean that
dialog: anyone's better than anyone else.
text: RAMON raises his hand.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: (to Roberta)
dialog: I really really hope that I get in

scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY
text: The house is transformed: the first floor is one long open
text: room with oak floors, a living room in front with a beautiful

text: rear, complete with pots hanging over a large butcher block.
text: NICK (17) practices cello and LEXI (15) practices piano;
text: they play Haydn's "Trio #13." Now handsome young men, their
text: blonde hair has darkened to brown. Nick is huskier; Lexi has

text: On the couch, RACHEL (12), a mature, beautiful Black girl,
text: rosins her bow.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: How come you guys don't play the

speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Well, picture her being your teacher

text: from outside with Allegra.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Hi Rachel. Be right with you.
text: As Roberta removes Allegra's leash, Rachel and Lexi share a
text: conspiratorial look. In the b.g., Nick packs up his cello.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: You're gonna practice upstairs?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No. I'm done.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Already? You've barely practiced.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What -- are you timing me with a
dialog: stop watch? Why don't you pick on
dialog: Lexi for a change?
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: 'Cause I'm perfect.
text: Nick jostles him and heads upstairs. Lexi gets up from the
dialog: piano.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: (to Rachel)
dialog: Have a good lesson.
text: He crosses to a sharp-looking bike parked behind the front

speaker_heading: LEXI

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Be careful.

scene_heading: EXT. RIVER EAST PARK - DUSK

text: As Lexi takes a drink --
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Can I try your bike?

text: watches tensely.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: I'm gonna be leaving pretty soon.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Just wanna take it for a spin.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: C'mon, Henry -- he don't want to

speaker_heading: HENRY

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Dang! I can't get that right.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You almost have it.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Almost isn't good enough.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Did I turn you into such a
dialog: perfectionist?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No. I came that way.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (smiles, then)
dialog: Just as long as you get it right for
dialog: your Julliard audition.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I've recommended you for a gifted

speaker_heading: LEXI

speaker_heading: ROBERTA

dialog: up for it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'll help him, O.K.? We'll both pay
dialog: you back.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Or we'll ask Dad -- he'll help us
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: O.K., slow down. It's the second one

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSING PROJECT - NIGHT

text: The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: C'mon Mom, let's get out of here.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Lock the doors.
text: And she exits. The boys watch as she heads for the building,
text: then Lexi shakes his head and covers his face.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: I'm dead. She's gonna get me killed.
text: Nick jumps out of the car and heads after her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm coming with you!
speaker_heading: ROBERTA

speaker_heading: ROBERTA

speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Henry's not here.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well you tell Henry that if he returns

text: A couple of beats.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN

speaker_heading: ROBERTA

speaker_heading: ISABEL

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Amanda, what did I tell you about
dialog: wearing cowboy boots to violin class?
dialog: They're too slippery!
text: She crosses to a pudgy Black/Puerto Rican boy with glasses.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Relax your two, Simon...
text: She glances at STEPHANIE, a white girl with red hair, next
text: to KENNY, a Black boy with an earnest expression.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Your stop sign has to be up, Kenny!
dialog: Stephanie, it doesn't look like you
dialog: ever had a lesson with me!
text: CARLOS (13) hurries in, a handsome Black boy in a baseball
text: jacket that says "LOS LEONES." He looks 15.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Where's your violin, Carlos?
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: It's coming.
text: He nervously looks down the hall.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What, is it walking here by itself?
text: A Black third-grade girl rushes into the room and hands Carlos
text: his violin, then runs off. Roberta crosses to Carlos as he
text: quickly readies the violin.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Your buddies giving you a hard time?
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Look, it's just not cool. You wouldn't
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Hey, you want your sister to carry
dialog: your violin, that's fine. But is she
dialog: practicing for you too? Because
dialog: lately, that's how it sounds.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: I've been busy! I've been --
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm not interested! Just get here on
dialog: time, and commit to this class or I
dialog: don't want you in here, you
dialog: understand?
text: He nods sullenly.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You're a good violinist, Carlos --
dialog: and it's definitely not "cool" to
dialog: waste your own talent.
text: Carlos takes this in as Roberta crosses to another student.

scene_heading: INT. RAMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Ramon sits on the floor, upset, half-heartedly building with
text: Legos, while his parents argue in the KITCHEN. His father
text: MANUELO is a stocky, muscular man. INTERCUT between the two

text: religious candles burn on a shelf above a washing machine.
speaker_heading: MANUELO
dialog: Why didn't you show it to me?
speaker_heading: CONCEPCION
dialog: It just needed one parent's signature.
speaker_heading: MANUELO
dialog: (with some Spanish)
dialog: Well, I'm his parent and I don't
dialog: give permission! He should be playing
dialog: baseball, not the violin!
speaker_heading: CONCEPCION
text: It makes him happy.

scene_heading: EXT. RIVER EAST SCHOOL - DAY

speaker_heading: GIRL

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I am special.

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (nonchalant)
dialog: So I heard from Julliard.
text: Roberta stops and looks at her.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: They said yes!
text: Roberta gives her a big hug.
scene_heading: INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: ON THE BEGINNER'S CLASS, including Ramon, as they play
text: "Lightly Row." Roberta walks around, making corrections as
text: she addresses the students. She doesn't see Justin poking
text: Ramon with his bow; Ramon swats the bow away and glares at
text: his nemesis. Roberta moves some of Shandra's braids away
dialog: from the violin.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: So when you take the violins home,
dialog: tape your music to the wall directly
dialog: in front of your nose so you can
dialog: play with perfect posture. Your
dialog: parents are gonna be so excited to
dialog: hear you play!
scene_heading: INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: SCREECHING comes from Ramon's room as he practices "Lightly
text: Row." His brothers, PEDRO (18) and ERNESTO (17), cringe as
text: they try to watch T.V. Ernesto gives up and puts on his

text: patiently as she folds laundry, but even she winces.
speaker_heading: PEDRO
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Ramon! How many cats you killing in
dialog: there?
text: INTERCUT RAMON - He plays with pride, eyes on the music taped

scene_heading: INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY (A FEW MONTHS LATER)
text: ON RAMON, his improved playing showing that time has passed.
text: WIDER - the beginner's class plays "Lightly Row."

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: More bow! To the frog! Myesha, your

dialog: Don't let it wiggle! You're on the

text: Vanessa enters the front door without her violin.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Where's your violin?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I forgot.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Goodbye! And you may be dropped.
text: Vanessa pouts and exits. Roberta moves to ROSARIO, a Puerto
dialog: Rican girl.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Look at those nails, Rosario!
text: She pulls a clipper from her pocket and swiftly clips them.
text: MYESHA nervously glances at her own nails.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I see you over there, Myesha.
text: She moves to Ramon and corrects his bowing position.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to Ramon)
dialog: You're doing much better.
text: As Roberta walks on to the next student, Justin purposely
text: knocks over Ramon's music stand.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Drop dead, Justin!
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: It was a accident!
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Was not!
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Ramon, I don't like that kind of
dialog: talk. Justin, pick up his stand,
dialog: now! Our spring concert is in three
dialog: weeks and you might not be in it. Is
dialog: that what you want?
scene_heading: EXT. CPE 1 - DAY

text: There's SNOW on the ground.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Mr. Klein? I'm gonna have to drop
dialog: Vanessa from the class if she keeps

speaker_heading: MR. KLEIN
dialog: (sotto)
text: She's going back and forth between
dialog: houses. My wife and I split up.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (softening)
dialog: Oh. I'm sorry.
text: Roberta leans into the car window.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Vanessa, maybe you could write down
dialog: for your Mom and Dad which days are
dialog: violin days.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: (almost in tears)
text: The tape doesn't stick.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
text: I taped the music to the wall at my
dialog: Mom's house and then I took it to my
dialog: Dad's house and it doesn't stick
dialog: anymore.
text: Mr. Klein's eyes tear up and he quickly wipes them.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well you know what? That's an easy
dialog: problem to solve.
text: She looks through her book bag, takes out a piece of music
text: and gives it to her.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Now you have two, O.K.? One for each
dialog: house.
text: Vanessa nods, clutching the piece of music. Roberta and Mr.

scene_heading: INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: RAMON

speaker_heading: MANUELO
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Not right now.

text: crosses to her husband.
speaker_heading: CONCEPCION
dialog: We made mistakes with Pedro and
dialog: Ernesto and we can't fix them now,
dialog: but Ramon -- he works so hard. The
dialog: violin makes him want to be good at
dialog: everything.
text: He shows no response, and she exits. Manuelo ponders what
dialog: she said.
scene_heading: EXT. CPE 1 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY (MORNING)
text: Roberta approaches the school on a winter morning. She smiles
text: as she sees Vanessa get out of her MOTHER'S car with her

text: some teachers huddled in conversation. A few students are
text: crying.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to Isabel)
dialog: What happened?
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: The beginners sit on the floor and rosin their bows. A few
text: chat, but it's quieter than usual, except for RAMON who is
text: "blessing" kids with his violin bow.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: You go to heaven... You go to hell...
dialog: You go to hell... heaven...
text: Roberta enters slowly. She looks very shaken up. She takes
text: note of what Ramon is doing, and overhears Toussaint and
text: Shandra in mid-conversation.
speaker_heading: TOUSSAINT
dialog: My grandpa died and my uncle, so
dialog: that makes six.
speaker_heading: SHANDRA
dialog: I know more than that. At least seven
dialog: people... maybe even nine.
text: Roberta gently tells Ramon to sit, and then she sits down on
text: a child-sized chair in front of them.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I know that you've all heard the bad
dialog: news about Justin.
speaker_heading: MYESHA
dialog: I didn't hear.
speaker_heading: TOUSSAINT
text: There was a drive-by shooting by his
dialog: house and he got shot on accident
dialog: and he died.
text: Myesha takes this in, looking sad.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Does anyone want to talk about it?
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: (angry)
dialog: I think we should just play violin.
text: Roberta watches him.
scene_heading: INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN AREA - DAY
text: Concepcion cooks chicken and Pedro sets the table, whistling
text: along to Ramon's O.S. violin playing "We Shall Overcome."
text: There's a KNOCK on the door. Concepcion answers it, revealing
dialog: Roberta.
speaker_heading: CONCEPCION
dialog: Roberta! Come in.
text: Roberta enters.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I came by to check on Ramon.
speaker_heading: CONCEPCION
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Didn't he tell you what happened at
dialog: school?
text: Concepcion shakes her head no.
scene_heading: INT. RAMON'S ROOM - DAY
text: Ramon is still playing violin as Concepcion and Roberta enter.
text: When he sees Roberta he straightens up even more.
speaker_heading: CONCEPCION
dialog: Roberta wants to talk to you, O.K.?
text: He nods. Concepcion touches his head, then exits.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Did that sound O.K.?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Yeah, it did.
text: Ramon smiles, pleased with himself.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I've been thinking about Justin.
dialog: Remember how mad I got the last time
dialog: I saw him?
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Yeah. You got very strict with him.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: It wasn't always so easy to be nice
dialog: to him, you know?
text: Ramon looks away from her, upset.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: You think Justin's in heaven or hell?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Heaven.
text: Ramon runs his fingers along his bow.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: I told him to drop dead.
text: Roberta touches Ramon's back.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Justin didn't die because of what
dialog: you said. I promise.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I don't think you're that powerful,
dialog: do you? I mean, if you had such
dialog: powers, just imagine what kind of
dialog: violin player you'd be by now!
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Yeah. I'd be better than you!
text: They laugh together, then Ramon looks sad again.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: It's O.K. to cry, you know.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Not for a man.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: My boys still cry and they're big,
text: strong young men now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I bet Justin's daddy cried.
text: Ramon's eyes get teary. Roberta quietly leaves the room.
scene_heading: EXT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - ESTABLISHING - DAY (SPRING)
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Roberta brings in the mail, looking curiously at a manila
text: envelope with a return address from the NY REVIEW OF BOOKS.
text: She opens it, looks inside, then pours out a batch of other
text: letters onto the table. They're addressed to BOX HOLDER 127.
text: She opens one, reads it, then rushes to an INTERCOM.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Nick, Lexi! Get down here right now!
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - MOMENTS LATER
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: We were just trying to help!
text: Nick and Lexi stand by the table, opposite Roberta -- with
text: the incriminating pile of letters between them.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: This is humiliating!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Mom, no one knows it's you! I mean,
dialog: you don't even have to read them if
dialog: you don't want to.
dialog: (glances at pile)
dialog: Although obviously, a lot of guys
dialog: are interested in dating you.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No. A lot of guys are interested in
dialog: dating you and Lexi.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What did you say about me, anyway?
dialog: They thought she'd never ask.
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: NICK

text: They beam with pride. Roberta looks at them, mortified.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Oh, my God.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Did you catch all the music metaphors?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Don't you think it's a little weird
dialog: that you're trying to get your mother
dialog: a date?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Don't you think it's a little weird
dialog: that you're not even interested in
dialog: dating?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Boys, look. Number one -- even if I
dialog: wanted to date, I don't have time.
dialog: And number two -- I've got my
dialog: teaching, I've got you guys -- that's
dialog: all I need.
text: The boys nod, disappointed, and she exits. They look at each

speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: I really thought she'd like the music
dialog: metaphors.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm not flat.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: The B sounded flat.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Just play the violin, Mom. I'll take

speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: You nervous, Mom?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No. I'm fine.

scene_heading: INT. DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Standing in the doorway is a man in casual college professor

text: Lexi shows him in.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: DAN

dialog: Wow. An honest woman.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Honest?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Your ad. When you said you were

scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON CLOCK

text: O.S., there's the SOUND OF A CAR. They race to the window.
speaker_heading: LEXI
text: Ten bucks he tries to kiss her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That's a no-brainer. Of course he'll
dialog: try. The real question is whether
dialog: she'll let him.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: O.K. -- ten bucks she lets him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You're on.
text: They stare out the window intently.
scene_heading: INT. DAN'S CAR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I had a lot of fun tonight.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Yeah, I did too.
speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, I have a confession -- my boys

text: They both laugh, then smile at each other. An awkward beat:
text: will he or won't he? Dan leans in to kiss her, and Roberta
text: turns away, uncertain.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Look, Dan -- I went along with this
dialog: 'cause it's been a while. Quite a
dialog: while... And I had a very nice time...
dialog: but I'm not sure if I'm ready to get
dialog: involved with anyone right now.
text: A beat. Roberta feels badly about rejecting him.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Does this mean I don't get any
dialog: lasagna?
text: Roberta cracks up. Dan smiles at her.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ROBERTA

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: ROBERTA

speaker_heading: LEXI

speaker_heading: ROBERTA

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I don't know yet. We'll see.

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Guys, I'm so sorry -- I got stuck
text: over at CPE 2...

speaker_heading: ROBERTA

speaker_heading: RAMON

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What?!
scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Janet and Dennis talk outside Janet's office. Roberta storms

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Is it true?
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Why don't you come in my office?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: It's true? You're firing me?
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: It's not me, Roberta. The Board of
dialog: Ed. cut the budget, the District had
dialog: to comply, and as of the end of this
dialog: term, the violin program has been...
dialog: excessed.
text: Roberta takes this in, momentarily speechless. In the b.g.,
text: the beginners slip into the hall to watch.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
text: Excessed.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They specifically said that my violin
dialog: program has to go.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: They've slashed the budget -- music
dialog: and art programs got hit the worst.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What about Dennis' classes?
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I'm tenured, Roberta.
text: Roberta looks at him, then back to Janet.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: When was this decided?
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Things happened very quickly... I
dialog: wanted to tell you myself --
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (reeling)
dialog: I just... I can't even believe this
dialog: is happening!
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Why not? You're a sub. Your position
dialog: has never been permanent.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Shut up, Dennis! You're not helping!
dialog: (softly, to Roberta)
dialog: Come into my office, please.
text: They leave Dennis standing there, looking as if he's had his
text: face slapped.
scene_heading: INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: There's gotta be a way to fight this!
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Fight it with what? I don't have any
dialog: other extra programs to give them
dialog: instead.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Oh, I see. So after ten years, after
dialog: fourteen hundred children have learned
dialog: to play the violin, this is just an
dialog: "extra program."
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: You know I don't feel that way and
dialog: you know damn well I've been standing
dialog: by you all these years! You think I
dialog: haven't noticed what you've done for
dialog: these kids?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Then do something!
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: (points to her phone)
dialog: I've been on this phone for the past
dialog: three days trying to "do something" --
dialog: the District office can't even stand
dialog: the sound of my voice. Believe me,
dialog: there are some people around here
dialog: I'd much rather get rid of. But as
dialog: far as the Board's concerned, violin
dialog: classes are not a priority.
text: Roberta's fury starts to give way to grief. She looks terribly
text: wounded. Janet looks at her helplessly.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: I don't have the power here, Roberta.
dialog: I'm so sorry.
text: A beat, and Roberta exits.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
text: Roberta's dazed and in pain as she walks through the crowds
text: of children, oblivious to kids calling her name and waving.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)
text: Nick and Lexi enter the darkened house, chatting as Nick
text: wheels in the bike and Lexi bounces a basketball. They turn
text: on a light to reveal
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
text: sitting at the kitchen table with a

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What happened?
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)
text: Roberta, Nick and Lexi walk Allegra in their neighborhood.

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm a good teacher. I've worked so
dialog: hard to give these kids something to
dialog: be proud of.
text: Lexi moves to comfort her.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: I'm so sorry, Mom. I can't believe
dialog: they did this to you.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: It's like when my father got killed.
dialog: For twenty years, he followed every
dialog: safety rule the factory had, and
text: then someone else flips the wrong
dialog: switch...
dialog: (she chokes up)
dialog: It's not fair. You do everything
dialog: right and then...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's the wrong analogy. You couldn't
dialog: do anything about Grandpa's death.
dialog: It was irreversible. This isn't.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Tell that to the Board of Education.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Let me ask you something. Why did
dialog: you risk your life for a bicycle?
text: Roberta and Lexi look at Nick, baffled as to the relevance
dialog: of the question.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I did not risk my life.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Of course you did! That building?
dialog: Threatening Henry? And for what --
dialog: two hundred dollars?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No. Not for that.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Then why?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: When someone steals something that
dialog: belongs to my kids, I'm not gonna
dialog: sit back and let that happen!
text: A beat as she realizes what she's just said. The boys look
text: at her and the three of them stop walking.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Guys -- you need to think about this.
dialog: If I try to fight this -- with no
dialog: salary coming in -- I could lose the
dialog: house, screw up your college plans...
dialog: It would be a lot safer to just go
dialog: out tomorrow and get a job in a
dialog: private school.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Yeah, but is that where you really

scene_heading: BUSINESS CARD.
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY
scene_heading: INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DEPT. OF JOURNALISM - DAY
text: FOLLOW DAN PAXTON as he walks down the hall towards his office
text: and sees a strange silver object on the floor in front of
text: his office door. He picks it up.
speaker_heading: INSERT
text: -- A foil-covered plate with a note on top: DO YOU KNOW ANYONE
text: AT THE NEW YORK TIMES?
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Dan lifts up the foil to reveal a large piece of LASAGNA.
scene_heading: INT. CPE 1 AUDITORIUM - THE CONCERT - STAGE - NIGHT
text: SEVENTY-FIVE KIDS play "We Shall Overcome" and it's incredibly
text: moving. Nick's on cello, Lexi plays piano. ROBERTA proudly
text: leads the children. At the side of the stage, we see DOROTHEA
text: photographing the concert. THE CAMERA PANS THE AUDIENCE of
text: teary-eyed parents, many of them with CAM CORDERS. We FIND
text: Ramon's family. Manuelo is riverted by his son's playing,
text: and he starts to cry. Concepcion knows this without looking.
text: She takes his hand.
text: ANGLE - JANET stands along the side and her eyes start to
text: fill with tears. She tries to stay composed, then discreetly
text: exits the auditorium.
text: The song ends and the audience APPLAUDS, rising from their
text: seats, including ASSUNTA (now 65), next to ISABEL and DAN.
text: Someone remains seated: a REPORTER (40's), sitting beside
text: Dan and taking notes.
text: The STUDENTS bow, then point to Roberta who bows and takes
text: the stage. She gestures for people to sit. A beginner student
text: brings her flowers. Roberta kisses her, then approaches the
dialog: mike.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to the audience)
dialog: The beautiful concert that you just
dialog: heard could be the last concert of
dialog: the East Harlem Violin Program. The
dialog: Board of Education and the District
dialog: Superintendent don't think that music
dialog: is important for our children. But
dialog: they're wrong -- and they're in for
dialog: a fight.
text: The parents stand and applaud. We see the REPORTER writing
text: quickly. Dorothea snaps more pictures. Roberta extends an
text: arm towards the kids, directing the applause at them. Ramon
text: gives her a thumbs up.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: ROBERTA is vacuuming the living room while Assunta dusts.
text: Extra chairs are set up in the living room in preparation
text: for a meeting. The doorbell RINGS.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Someone's early.
text: FOLLOW ASSUNTA to the DOOR. She opens it, revealing JANET,
text: who's carrying two bags of groceries. Assunta's demeanor
text: instantly cools when she sees her. In the b.g. Roberta sees
text: Janet and turns off the vacuum cleaner.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Hello, Assunta. How are you?
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: I'd be a lot better if my daughter
dialog: had a job next year.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Ma!
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: (to Assunta)
dialog: I would too.
text: Janet briskly walks into THE LIVING ROOM, puts the grocery
text: bags down on a table, and begins to take things out of them.
text: Roberta watches her, mystified.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: (to Roberta)
dialog: Sorry I'm early, but I figured we'd
dialog: need time to set up.
text: Roberta watches Janet for a beat, then addresses Assunta.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Mama, why don't you take Allegra out
dialog: for a walk?
text: Assunta hesitates for a beat, then gets the dog and exits.
text: Janet continues unpacking the bags as if there's nothing
dialog: unusual about her being there. Cheeses, crackers, bread,
text: salads, fruit, paper plates, napkins, etc. She sees Roberta's
text: confused expression.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: You are having a meeting here tonight,
dialog: right? Parents and teachers?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, yes, but ...
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Take it from me. If you want to get
dialog: parents to help you with something,
dialog: you have to feed them.
text: She holds up two wedges of cheese.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: You have a cutting board for these?
text: Roberta crosses into the kitchen and returns with a cutting
text: board and a knife.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: (as she continues to
dialog: unpack)
dialog: And if you think parents are bad,
dialog: teachers are even worse, no offense.
dialog: If you don't feed them, you never
dialog: get anything extra out of them. That's
dialog: why I got this.
text: She pulls out an Entenmann's blackout cake.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Entenmann's gets them every time.
text: Roberta continues to stare in amazement at Janet.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: What? Don't tell me you expected me
dialog: to bring something homemade.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (as she takes the
dialog: cake from her)
dialog: Well, no... I --
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Good. Because take it from me -- my
dialog: own family begs me to stay out of
dialog: the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What I didn't expect was for you to
dialog: be here.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Why not? We've gotta figure out a
dialog: way to fight this.
dialog: (as she arranges
dialog: crackers on a plate)
dialog: After ten years, Roberta, I can't
dialog: imagine walking through those hallways
dialog: and not hearing that off-key,
text: screechy, scratchy, nails-on-the-
text: blackboard violin music.
text: Roberta smiles. Janet holds up a baguette.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: What do you think? Cut it into slices
dialog: now, or leave it whole?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Let's cut it now. It'll be less messy.
text: Janet hands her the bread. A beat as the two women exchange
text: a private smile, then return to their respective tasks.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
text: There's a crowd of PARENTS assembled in Roberta's front room,
text: talking at once, yelling out ideas, including CONCEPCION,
text: BEVERLY WILSON (Shandra's mom), MR. ADAMS (Black) and MRS.
text: ADAMS (Puerto Rican), the parents of James (from Roberta's
text: first year) and Simon. DOROTHEA, JANET, ISABEL are also there;
text: ASSUNTA is keeping tabs on the refreshments.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Don't they realize how much this
dialog: program helps the kids?
speaker_heading: MR. ADAMS
dialog: Simon's our third child to study
text: with Roberta. James is pre-med,
text: April's valedictorian -- now that
dialog: says something!
speaker_heading: MR. KLEIN
dialog: I think we should inundate the Board
dialog: and the District with letters.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: You're wasting your time. The Board
dialog: and the District are not gonna pay
dialog: for this program, no matter how many
dialog: letters they get.
text: Disappointed grumblings.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: What if we raise the money ourselves?
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: I can't see how they'd object to
dialog: that.
text: A beat as people take this in.
speaker_heading: CONCEPCION
dialog: Well once that newspaper article
dialog: comes out, that should help bring in
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: BEVERLY
dialog: Yeah, but what if it doesn't? For
dialog: all we know, it's gonna be buried on
dialog: the back page. Besides, who says
dialog: anyone's gonna give a damn about our
dialog: kids?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (to Roberta)
dialog: What if you do a benefit concert? We
dialog: can raise a batch of money from ticket
dialog: sales, and then the concert itself
dialog: could be great publicity. There's
dialog: word of mouth... you could get
dialog: reviewed...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: It better be a good concert!
text: Some people laugh but we see the anxiety on Roberta's face.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: We have to offer something more than
dialog: me and the kids.
dialog: (to Dorothea)
dialog: Do you think maybe your husband would
dialog: perform with us?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (slyly)
dialog: I'm sure I could persuade him with a
dialog: little pillow talk. And maybe he can
dialog: get another violinist too -- Itzhak
dialog: Perlman, perhaps.
text: This gets people's attention.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: That would be fantastic.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: We could rent a place like the 92nd
dialog: Street Y -- it's perfect for this.
dialog: It seats about nine hundred people
dialog: and if we charge between fifty and a
dialog: hundred a ticket --
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: (to Roberta)
dialog: We could probably raise enough to
dialog: reinstate your program for a year.
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: Sounds like a plan.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (half to herself)
dialog: It better be a good concert.
text: The DOORBELL RINGS and Roberta crosses to get it. DAN enters,
text: holding copies of the NY POST, the DAILY NEWS, and a couple
text: of other papers. Each paper has been opened to a specific
dialog: page.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Take your pick.
text: Roberta grabs the top one -- the POST -- opened to page 5.
speaker_heading: INSERT
text: The page has a photo of Roberta at the Spring Concert, and a
text: large article headlined A VIOLIN TEACHER FIGHTS BACK.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: Lots of chaos as a TELEVISION NEWS CREW sets up. Roberta
text: tries futilely to get the beginners to pay attention to her.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Kids, listen to me -- it's really
dialog: important that you don't look at the
dialog: camera and you try to act as natural
dialog: as possible.
text: Dennis storms in.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Who authorized this?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Janet.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Well Janet's not here today and I
dialog: want these people out of here.
text: The kids quiet down and watch them argue. A CAMERA GUY starts
text: shooting the argument and Dennis sees him.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Turn that off, you hear me?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Why are you doing this? We're not
dialog: bothering anyone.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: You're disrupting school and I want
dialog: them out of here -- now.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You still don't get it, do you? I
dialog: don't care if you hate me, Dennis --
dialog: that's your business. But think about
dialog: the students for once. Every time
dialog: you interfere, you're not hurting me --
dialog: you're hurting them.
text: She points to the kids. They're silent, waiting to see if
text: Roberta got through to him. A beat.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Get these people out of here or I'm
dialog: calling the police.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Go right ahead, call them. That'll
dialog: look real good on the eleven o'clock
dialog: news.
text: A beat and he exits. Roberta takes a deep breath, then turns
text: back to the kids who are watching her, impressed.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: I don't hear no sirens.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: ON THE TV is the news segment: ROBERTA speaks to an unseen
dialog: interviewer.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm from a blue collar family, and
dialog: if it weren't for the lessons I got
dialog: in public school, I never would have
dialog: learned the violin.
text: It CUTS TO Roberta's beginners speaking to the interviewer.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
dialog: How does it make you feel to lose
dialog: your violin program?
speaker_heading: SHANDRA
dialog: It makes us sad!
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Yeah, like we're never gonna have no
dialog: more violin lessons --
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: And it's bad because... because we
dialog: love violin class.

scene_heading: INT. ARNOLD STEINHARDT AND DOROTHEA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
scene_heading: ON TV - THE SAME NEWS SEGMENT, ANOTHER SOUND BITE
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Yes, I've gotten offers from two

dialog: want to be.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA (O.S.)
dialog: Arnold, these kids need help.
text: WIDER - REVEAL a comfortable Upper East Side apartment and

text: FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHY on the walls, signed by Dorothea.
speaker_heading: ARNOLD
dialog: Didn't we send them a donation?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: They need something bigger. And you
dialog: can't just write a check -- you have
dialog: to get involved.
speaker_heading: ARNOLD
dialog: Involved how?
text: The look on her face tells him it's more than he bargained
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: ARNOLD
dialog: Uh-oh.
scene_heading: INT. SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY
text: 1. Arnold Steinhardt speaks on the phone. His Roladex is
text: open to the name ITZHAK PERLMAN. In the b.g., Dorothea tensely
text: waits to hear if Itzhak Perlman will say yes.
text: 2. Parents, Roberta, Nick and Lexi hang "FIDDLEFEST CONCERT"
text: posters around their neighborhood, announcing a concert at
scene_heading: THE 92ND STREET Y with ARNOLD STEINHARDT, ITZHAK PERLMAN and
text: STUDENTS FROM THE EAST HARLEM VIOLIN PROGRAM.
dialog: 3. Parents -- including Beverly Wilson, Concepcion, Mr. Adams
text: and Carlos' mom and dad -- stuff envelopes with INVITATIONS
text: to "FIDDLEFEST" and accompanying LETTERS and TICKET ORDER
text: FORMS. Roberta and Dorothea open envelopes with filled-out
text: TICKET ORDER FORMS and CHECKS. They stack the checks in a
text: pile, address return envelopes and place FIDDLEFEST TICKETS
text: inside them.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: Thirty-three excited kids from Roberta's different classes
text: chat, tune their violins, rosin their bows. The students
text: include Carlos, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Rachel, Simon,
text: Ramon, Vanessa, and Shandra. Roberta enters the room, full
text: of energy, and addresses them as she heads to the front.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Listen up, everyone! Quiet down!
text: The students give her their attention.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You are my very best beginner and
dialog: advanced violin students and I've
dialog: chosen you to play in Fiddlefest
dialog: because I trust that you can handle
dialog: the pressure. It's gonna be a lot of
dialog: work -- a lot. Right now, we've sold
dialog: some tickets, but I'm not gonna be
dialog: back here in the fall if the audience
text: storms out of their seats, demanding
dialog: a refund!
text: She nods to Rachel who starts handing out sheets of music.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Rachel's gonna be my lieutenant and
dialog: I expect you to listen to her.
text: Ramon looks through his music sheets.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Bach's "Minuet One"?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: People are gonna be paying good money
dialog: for this concert -- we're not just
dialog: gonna play "Twinkle."
dialog: (handing out papers)
dialog: I'm passing out a contract that you
dialog: and your parents need to sign.
text: The kids read the contracts. Carlos' eyes widen.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Every Saturday and Sunday?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Plus night time rehearsals during
dialog: the week. There's only six weeks
dialog: till the concert, so classes in school
dialog: won't be enough.
text: The kids look sobered by this.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Come to think of it, we'll probably
dialog: also need to meet before school.
text: Lots of grumbling: "Say what?" "No way!" "Before school?"
dialog: I'ma be sleepwalking!"
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You've heard of Navy Seal Training?
dialog: Well, this is gonna be Roberta String
dialog: Training.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - Two young men and two young women walk in,
text: carrying violins. We realize from the scar that one is NAEEM
text: (20), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall.
text: With him is DE SEAN (19), a short guy with dreadlocks, looking
text: more like a rapper than a violinist. GUADALUPE (19), walking
text: with a cane, is now a beautiful young woman, her long braid
text: pinned up. The fourth is a reserved Puerto Rican woman (20).
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Oh my god! Naeem! De Sean!
dialog: (hugs them)
dialog: Guadalupe!
text: She hugs her, then looks closely at the other woman.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Lucy? Is that you?
text: The woman snaps her fingers and smiles. Roberta laughs and
text: embraces her, then turns to the students.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Kids, these are four of my very first
dialog: violin students and I've asked them
dialog: to play in the concert with us.
dialog: (to the alumni)
dialog: I was just telling them how hard
dialog: they're gonna have to work.
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: (to class)
dialog: Take it from me -- this lady don't
dialog: lie. Y'all are gonna work your butts
dialog: off.
scene_heading: INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Ramon's father carefully reads the violin contract while
text: Ramon and Concepcion anxiously watch. He stops to look up a
text: word in the English-Spanish dictionary beside him. Ramon and
text: his mom are squirming. Manuelo nods as he finishes reading,
text: then SIGNS the contract. Ramon breaks into a smile, throws
text: his little arms around his Papa and kisses him.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER EAST - DAY
text: School's letting out; Carlos' sister exits, carrying Carlos'
text: violin. A few beats later, Carlos quickly exits, checking
text: his watch. He sees his LOS LEONES teammates standing in a
text: group, and tries to bypass them without being noticed, but
text: they spot him.
speaker_heading: TEAMMATE #1
dialog: Hey Carlos! Where ya goin'? We got a
dialog: game, remember?
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Yeah, I know, but... I can't make
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TEAMMATE #1
dialog: What you talkin' about?
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: I just can't make it.
speaker_heading: TEAMMATE #2
dialog: You got a date with the violin
dialog: teacher?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Yeah. I do.
text: He dashes off, a barrage of Spanish and English curses behind
text: him, and crosses to his sister, waiting for him DOWN THE
text: STREET. He takes the violin from her and carries it himself.
scene_heading: INT. CPE MUSIC ROOM - DAY
text: The Fiddlefest kids, including Carlos, Vanessa, Shandra,
text: Ramon, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Simon, Thomas, De Sean and
text: Guadalupe practice Bach's "Minuet One," Roberta leading them
text: and giving direction. They're playing badly.
text: Rachel plays as well, but walks around the room making
text: corrections. It's early morning, and the kids look half-
dialog: asleep.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Frog! Frog! I need more accents on
dialog: the down beat! More bow! More!
text: They play a few more bars and still sound pretty bad.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Stop! Stop!
dialog: (they do so)
dialog: You sound horrible! Isn't anyone
dialog: practicing?
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: How can we practice? We're rehearsing
dialog: all the time.
text: Some kids laugh, including Stephanie.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to Stephanie)
dialog: You think this is funny, Stephanie?
dialog: (to all of them)
dialog: You think the four hundred people
dialog: who've bought tickets so far will
dialog: think it's funny too? You think Itzhak
dialog: Perlman will think it's funny that
dialog: he's donating his time and you're
dialog: all gonna stink?
text: Vanessa yawns and Roberta sees her. Uh-oh.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Am I boring you, Vanessa?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: No. It's 7:30 in the morning. I'm
dialog: just tired.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: There's no time to be tired.
dialog: (to all, getting her
dialog: violin in position)
dialog: Let's try it again.
scene_heading: INT. ARNOLD AND DOROTHEA'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Dorothea opens the door for Roberta who just charges in,
text: agitated, without even saying hello. We sense that Dorothea
text: too, is troubled by something.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I must have been crazy to agree to
dialog: this. They're never gonna be ready.
dialog: And you should hear the Bach Double!
dialog: A disaster. So the good news is
dialog: tickets are selling like hot cakes,
dialog: but the bad news is that the kids
dialog: sound like shit.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: There's more bad news... We've lost
dialog: the Y.
text: Roberta looks at her, aghast.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: They had a flood -- a water heater
dialog: burst... The concert hall was damaged
dialog: and they've cancelled all events.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Until when?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: "Until further notice."
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: This can't happen! We've sold tickets!
dialog: We've done publicity! The concert's
dialog: in three weeks!
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I've been on the phone all morning
dialog: calling other theaters. Nothing's
dialog: available.
text: They both sink into the couch, completely undone by this.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Just keep looking.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
text: The Fiddlefest kids are crammed into Roberta's house,
dialog: (including De Sean, Guadalupe, Ramon, Vanessa, Shandra,
text: Carlos, Thomas, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, and Simon),
text: rehearsing "Orange Blossom Special." They play badly. Rachel
dialog: helps Roberta correct students.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Stop! Someone's playing the wrong
dialog: notes! And you shouldn't need your
dialog: music anymore! Except for the Bach
dialog: Double, everything has to be memorized
dialog: by next rehearsal!
text: The kids look at each other, daunted.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: And you sound like you're
dialog: sleepwalking. Your heart's not even
dialog: in it.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Maybe 'cause we don't have a place
dialog: for the concert.
text: Roberta looks at her, and then notices the despondent looks
text: on many of the kids' faces.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, you're right. This might all
dialog: be for nothing. So we can either
dialog: keep on rehearsing in case we find a
dialog: place -- or we can just... give up.
speaker_heading: DE SEAN
dialog: Am I hearing right? Did you use the
dialog: words "give up"?
dialog: (to the students)
dialog: Let's take a vote. How many of you
dialog: want to give up?
text: No one raises a hand. Roberta takes this in.
speaker_heading: GUADALUPE
dialog: See? You taught us well.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: It's early morning. Lexi cooks breakfast while Nick and
text: Roberta look at scribbled-on, marked-up lists.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What about in the Bronx?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: There's nothing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why don't you just do it in one of
dialog: the schools? It'll be a lot smaller
dialog: but --
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: We won't make enough money.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: What about postponing it?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Itzhak and Arnold are booked all
dialog: summer.
text: They all look depressed. Lexi places an equally depressing-
text: looking stack of pancakes on the table. There's a BANGING on
text: the door, startling everyone.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA (O.S.)
dialog: It's Dorothea.
text: Nick opens the door and Dorothea rushes in, out of breath,
dialog: talking a mile a minute.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I have good news -- really good news.
dialog: Arnold got a call from his friend
dialog: Wally Scheur who heard about us losing
dialog: the Y and wanted to see how he could
dialog: help -- and then Wally had this
dialog: brilliant idea and called his friend
dialog: Isaac Stern and it's all arranged!
dialog: We have a new place for Fiddlefest!
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Carnegie Hall.
text: Dorothea grins from ear to ear, Nick and Lexi whoop and
text: holler, and all wait for Roberta to jump up and down for joy --
text: but she looks stricken.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: Carnegie Hall?
scene_heading: INT. CARNEGIE HALL - DAY
text: CLOSE ON THE CEILING OF CARNEGIE HALL, revolving slowly.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL THIS IS ROBERTA'S POV
text: She stands on the empty stage, gazing at the ceiling as she
text: slowly turns around. She's holding her violin case. She looks
scene_heading: at the UPPER BALCONIES -- THE LOWER BALCONIES -- THE ORCHESTRA
text: SEATS. Her footsteps echo as she walks towards the front of
text: the stage, then stops.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON ROBERTA
text: We can see her imagining the audience on the night of the
text: concert. She can't believe her eyes. A beat, and she looks
text: around to make sure she's alone. She takes out her violin,
text: takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her "audience,"
text: then starts to play the second violin part of the Bach Double
text: Concerto. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening.
text: Roberta stops.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Incredible sound in this room, no?
text: Roberta turns to see ISAAC STERN approaching her. She's
text: completely flustered.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Oh my god -- Isaac Stern.
speaker_heading: ISAAC STERN
dialog: You must be Roberta.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Thank you so much for helping us.
speaker_heading: ISAAC STERN
dialog: (looking out at the
dialog: hall)
dialog: Would you believe in 1960, they tried
dialog: to tear this place down? They wanted
dialog: to replace it with a bright red
dialog: skyscraper -- we called it "the red
dialog: terror."
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: ISAAC STERN
dialog: We had to fight like hell, but with
dialog: a lot of help, we saved Carnegie
dialog: Hall.
text: Roberta takes this in, relating it to her own struggle.
speaker_heading: ISAAC STERN
dialog: If it's all right with you, I'd like
dialog: to play in your concert. Maybe bring
dialog: a couple of friends...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Yes, of course! That would be great!
text: Isaac nods, then touches her shoulder.
speaker_heading: ISAAC STERN
dialog: Don't give up.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE, UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY
text: Roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding
text: cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly. Dan sits
text: across from her, observing.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I just don't see how I'm gonna do
dialog: this. It's huge. It's gigantic! It's
dialog: Carnegie Hall! And listen to this:
dialog: now Isaac Stern wants to play with
dialog: us -- Diane Monroe, Michael Tree --
dialog: there's other people calling --
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That's fantastic!
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Fantastic? I'll never get the kids
dialog: up to speed in time, I'll never get
dialog: myself up to speed. I'm gonna be
dialog: playing side by side with the world's
dialog: greatest violinists.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: And "the world's greatest violinists"
dialog: are playing side by side with you

dialog: this fight.
text: He offers her a forkful of some decadent-looking chocolate
text: cake, but she shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Yes, but... you don't understand.
dialog: Maybe there's a good reason why I
dialog: never made it as a violinist -- maybe
dialog: I just can't cut it. I keep blaming
dialog: it on not having enough early
dialog: training, but if I were talented, if
dialog: I had a gift --
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: But you do have a gift. You're gonna
dialog: put thirty East Harlem kids on stage
dialog: at Carnegie Hall not because they're
dialog: prodigies, but because you got them
dialog: to stick with something that's hard
dialog: as hell and to strive for excellence --
dialog: which, by the way, I certainly wasn't
dialog: striving for when I was their age.
dialog: Not to mention the other ten years'
dialog: worth of students whose lives were
dialog: changed because of you. That's your
dialog: talent, Roberta.
text: She takes this in, looks at him gratefully and puts her hand
text: over his. He strokes her hand.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm scared.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And by the way, I happen to think
dialog: you're a pretty good violinist too.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: You've barely heard me play.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I've heard enough to know you're
dialog: gonna do just fine.
text: Roberta looks at him with trepidation. Dan takes another
text: forkful of his cake.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Besides, no one's gonna be paying
dialog: attention to your playing anyway.
text: Roberta laughs. Dan smiles, glad he got her to lighten up.
scene_heading: EXT. CPE 1 - DAY (EARLY MORNING)
dialog: The Fiddlefest kids (including Ramon, Shandra, Vanessa, De
text: Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Simon, Stephanie, Amanda and
text: Kenny -- but RACHEL is absent) stand outside the locked school
text: gate, waiting for Roberta. Some of the kids have their violins
text: out of the cases, tuning them.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: Teacher's late. I think she should
dialog: be dropped, don't you?
dialog: Kids laugh.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Yeah. I don't think we should let
dialog: her play in Fiddlefest!
text: A few kids start playing "CAN-CAN." It catches on, and more
text: of them join in. PASSERSBY stop to listen, and some drop
text: change into the open cases. RAMON and a couple of other kids
dialog: grin at this.
text: CARLOS steps in front of the kids as he plays, and begins an
text: uncanny imitation of Roberta:
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: More bow! To the frog! You sound
dialog: terrible! I can't believe how terrible
dialog: you sound!
text: The kids crack up, but a few spot ROBERTA heading quickly up
text: the street. Carlos is oblivious to this -- and no one signals
text: him that Roberta's watching.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: You're gonna make everyone in Carnegie
dialog: Hall sick to their stomachs! That's
dialog: right, they're gonna pay a thousand
dialog: dollars a ticket and you're gonna
dialog: make them throw up on their gowns
dialog: and tuxedos!
text: Carlos senses a presence and turns to see Roberta. A tense
text: beat as he awaits her reaction.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (in all seriousness)
dialog: If you're gonna imitate me, do it
dialog: right.
dialog: (corrects his posture)
dialog: Shoulders back. Violin higher. Check
dialog: your feet. There.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: G'head, Carlos. Continue.
text: Carlos freezes.
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: No, that's O.K. You can take it from
dialog: here.
text: Roberta nods, and addresses the kids as she unlocks the gate.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: He's right, by the way. You do sound
dialog: terrible, and you are gonna make
dialog: everyone in Carnegie Hall sick to
dialog: their stomachs.
text: The kids start filing in. Rachel comes up the street and
text: catches up to Roberta.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I need to talk to you.
text: Roberta sees how distressed Rachel looks.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (to kids)
dialog: I'll be right in. Start on Minuet
dialog: One.
dialog: (to Rachel)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We're moving away.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What? Where are you moving?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (looking downward)
dialog: It's a secret... My father... he's
dialog: been hurting my mom... We have to
dialog: leave.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Has he been hurting you too?
text: Rachel shakes her head no, then starts to cry a little.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm sorry about Julliard... and the
dialog: concert.
text: She hands Roberta her violin.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Keep it. Take it with you.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No... I don't want to play anymore.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What?! You can't give up violin,
dialog: Rachel -- it's a part of you. A very
dialog: important part.
text: Rachel looks anguished. Roberta moves closer and touches her
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Please honey. Just take it.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don't want to.
text: Roberta looks at her, pained, then hugs her. Rachel quickly
text: kisses Roberta goodbye and exits. Roberta watches her.
scene_heading: INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
text: Roberta leads De Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Stephanie,
text: Thomas, Carlos, Erica and Nicholas in the Bach Double
text: Concerto. The other kids watch. Roberta's on the edge of
text: hysteria. She signals the players to stop.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: No, no, no! Accent the up bow after
dialog: the slurred notes and then it'll get
dialog: you off of those slurred notes! You
dialog: Double Concerto kids need to be
dialog: working harder! This is the grand
dialog: finale of the concert! You're each
dialog: gonna be sharing a music stand with
dialog: one of the world's greatest
dialog: violinists!
text: The kids say "the world's greatest violinists" along with
dialog: her -- they've obviously been hearing this a lot. Roberta
text: glares at them.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I think we should forget the Bach
dialog: Double.
dialog: (to the other kids)
dialog: And you guys are never gonna get
dialog: Minuet One. I think we should drop
dialog: that too.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: No! We can do it, Roberta!
speaker_heading: CARLOS
dialog: And we'll get the Bach Double. We
dialog: will.
text: She stops, takes a breath.
speaker_heading: NAEEM
dialog: It's gonna be O.K., Roberta.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (vulnerable)
dialog: You think?
text: All the kids nod. A few beats.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: O.K...
dialog: (not believing it)
dialog: It's gonna be O.K.
text: She crosses to take a look at her music, and the kids exchange
dialog: looks that say, "Oh shit. What did we just promise?"
scene_heading: REHEARSAL MONTAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY
text: 1. Carlos practices violin against the fence around River
text: East School. In the b. g., his buddies make fun of him.
text: 2. Shandra practices in a school stairwell, ignoring a boy
text: who pulls one of her braids as he passes by.
text: 3. Stephanie practices at a bus stop, her eyes closed, then

scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)
text: Pandemonium. Nick and Lexi, both in tuxes, are doing several
text: tasks at once while Roberta, in a simple black velvet dress
text: and stockinged feet, tries to put on her makeup but keeps
text: poking her head out of the bathroom, giving orders. Allegra
text: BARKS outside the back door.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Nick -- did you feed Allegra?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (fixing Lexi's tie)
dialog: Yes, Mom.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Lexi, can you make sure the charts

dialog: Check again, please. And look for my
dialog: repair kit too.

text: She holds a small jewelry box and heads for the bathroom.
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: Bert, which earrings you want?
text: Roberta sticks her head out and picks the earrings. Assunta
text: enters the small bathroom to work on her own makeup.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Nick? Get two more violins.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You've already got two -- how many
dialog: emergencies can there be?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Get three more. And make sure a couple
text: of them are half-size.
text: Nick rolls his eyes and runs upstairs while Lexi organizes
text: things by the door: Nick's cello, Roberta's papers, extra
text: violins. Roberta rushes out of the bathroom, adjusting the
text: earrings. She starts compulsively straightening the house.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Lexi -- can you call about the car
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: Mom, they're not gonna forget to
dialog: send a car!
text: Nick comes running down the stairs with the violins and stares
text: in disbelief at Roberta fluffing a couch pillow.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
text: Just straightening a little.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You're insane, you know that?
dialog: (grabs the pillow)
dialog: Finish getting dressed!

scene_heading: INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - FRONT ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: ROBERTA (O.S.)
dialog: SHIT!
text: Nick and Assunta look towards the stairs. Roberta comes
text: running down.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Can you believe this?
text: She turns around, revealing a RIP on the back of the dress,
text: next to the zipper. The DOORBELL RINGS.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: It can't be time! Is it time?
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: I'll sew it in the car.
scene_heading: EXT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY
text: Roberta, Assunta and the boys step outside, amazed to see a
text: STRETCH LIMOUSINE double-parked in front, a CHAUFFEUR waiting.
speaker_heading: LEXI
dialog: See? I told you they'd send a car.
text: Roberta's open-mouthed. She leads her entourage towards the
text: limo. THE NEIGHBORS come out of their houses to watch. Some
text: lean out windows, gawking. Ad libs... "Who's that?" "It's
text: the Violin Lady!" LAWRENCE, dressed in a tux, gives Lexi a
text: high sign.
text: The chauffeur helps Roberta and Assunta into the limo while
text: Nick and Lexi start to load the instruments into the trunk.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Roberta sits down beside Assunta and turns around so Assunta

dialog: Don't worry about it. You rip -- I
dialog: sew.

speaker_heading: ASSUNTA

speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Charles?!
speaker_heading: ASSUNTA
dialog: If that jerk hadn't of left you,

text: see him. They're not quite sure how to greet each other --
text: he takes her hand, and then kisses her on the cheek.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Thank you...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I knew you'd get here sooner or later.

speaker_heading: ROBERTA

dialog: school where children could fulfill
dialog: their highest potential, despite the
dialog: challenges of poverty and racism.
dialog: Ten years ago, Roberta Guaspari walked
dialog: into my office because she needed a
dialog: job, and because she had a vision
dialog: that any child could learn the violin.
dialog: We put our dreams together and created
dialog: the East Harlem Violin Program which
dialog: has helped more than a thousand
dialog: students expand their vision of what's
dialog: possible in their lives. When a
dialog: program like this is cut, our
dialog: children's future is compromised. I
dialog: want to thank you for your support.
dialog: Enjoy the concert.
scene_heading: INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

dialog: of triumph.
scene_heading: INT. CARNEGIE HALL - STAGE - PODIUM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Roberta addresses the audience. Her voice is strong but softer
text: around the edges; she is a woman in a state of grace.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: We're all here tonight because we
dialog: have a bigger mission: to take the

dialog: with us out into the world, and to
