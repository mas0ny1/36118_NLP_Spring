dialog: becomes the power of one?
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 1 EXT. SOUTH AFRICAN FARM - DAY (1939) 1
text: A white car sits in the yard of the farmhouse. On the
text: door, a decal: "CAPETOWN SANITORIUM." Two men dressed
text: in the white uniforms of the sanitorium exit the farm-
text: house; one gently guiding a rather frail, troubled
text: woman toward the car; the other totes her suitcase.
text: The V.O. of a young man narrates:
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: There comes a time in everyone's
dialog: life when they discover that the
dialog: only person you can truly depend
dialog: on is yourself. That the only
dialog: real power anyone has to get
dialog: anything done is the power of one.
dialog: With any luck you can make it
dialog: through a lot of years before you
dialog: ever have to face the reality of
dialog: that fact.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It was a luxury I never had. I
dialog: discovered it the year my mother
dialog: had her nervous breakdown.
text: One attendant holds the rear door of the car open for
text: the woman. Before entering, she turns one last time
text: toward the farmhouse.
speaker_heading: 2 HER POV 2
text: A young BOY looking one part scared, one part sad, and
text: one part lost stares back at her, his hand held by a
text: large, amiable black woman with tears rolling down her
text: round cheeks.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: I was all of six.
dialog: 3.
scene_heading: 3 BACK TO SCENE 3
text: The woman enters the car. The car drives off down the
text: road. The Boy watches it disappear behind a plume of
text: swirling dust.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: My father died before I was born,
dialog: and even though I was raised by
dialog: my Zulu nanny, with my mother,
dialog: depending on her health, in
dialog: nominal attendance, it was
dialog: decided, with her departure, that
dialog: I, too, would depart...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ... for boarding school.
text: The dust the Boy has been watching reverses itself.
text: An unseen vehicle comes up the road.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: But before I could be sent out
dialog: into the world one very serious
dialog: matter had to be dealt with.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I was a chronic bedwetter. Since
dialog: my nanny was the one responsible
dialog: for my well-being, she did what
dialog: any responsible Zulu mother would
dialog: do. She called on the greatest
dialog: medicine man of her tribe --
dialog: Inkosi Inkosikazi.
text: Out of the dust a large black Buick ROADMASTER ROARS up
text: the road and into the yard, scattering chickens and
text: geese, stopping in front of the wide-eyed six-year-old
text: and his tremulous nanny. A huge Zulu jumps out of the
text: front passenger seat and opens the rear door. A moment
text: passes, and then two splayed, cracked feet descend from
text: the car and settle into the dust. INKOSI INKOSIKAZI,
text: 100 years old, small, black, wizened, hair and beard
text: whiter than cotton, a leopard skin draped over his
text: shoulders, a beaded fly switch in one hand, a trussed
text: chicken in the other, exits the car.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 4 EXT. YARD - NIGHT 4
text: A fire burns bright in the black African night. The Boy
text: sits holding the chicken, close by the fire, while Inkosi
text: Inkosikazi shuffles around him, drawing a circle in the
text: dust with a stick.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: Legend had it that Inkosi
dialog: Inkosikazi was the last son of
dialog: the great Zulu king, Dingaan,
dialog: who fought both the Boers and
dialog: the British to a standstill
dialog: nearly 100 years before, and the
dialog: night Inkosi Inkosikazi was
dialog: conceived stars fell from the
text: sky until the sun rose.
text: The circle complete, the old man sits down opposite the
text: Boy. From a leather pouch he produces several bones. He
text: throws the bones on the ground and studies them for a
text: moment. He begins to wave the fly switch back and forth
text: in front of the Boy's eyes, chanting low, softly. The
text: Boy's eyes grow heavy; his lids droop.
scene_heading: 5 DREAM - EXT. WATERFALL 5
text: The Boy and the old man are standing above a great
text: waterfall. In the swirling pool far below are ten
text: stepping stones linking one bank to the other.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: The medicine man instructed me to
text: jump off the falls and climb along
dialog: the ten stepping stones, counting
dialog: as I went until I reached dry
dialog: land.
text: The Boy jumps, cascading down the falls and into the pond
text: below. He clambers up the first rock. It is slippery.
text: He falls off and climbs back on, buffeted by the spraying
text: water. He makes his way stone by stone toward the other
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: Even though it was only a dream,
dialog: I felt as if my struggle to reach
dialog: dry land was terrifyingly real.
dialog: The water was like ice, bone-
text: chilling, cold, and as I made my
dialog: way from one stone to the next I
dialog: could feel my strength desert me.
dialog: The progress from one step to the next gets progressively
text: harder as the Boy keeps slipping into the swirling water,
text: coughing and sputtering.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: I was three rocks in when I ran
dialog: out of gas. I couldn't pull myself
dialog: any further. No matter how hard I
dialog: 5.
dialog: tried, the current tried harder.
dialog: I felt myself going under for the
dialog: last time.
text: The Boy's grip slips off the rock. He starts to go
dialog: under.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 6 EXT. FARMYARD - DAWN 6
text: The fire has gone out. The Boy is still sitting in the
text: circle, the chicken still in his lap. His eyes snap
text: open. The first thing he sees is Inkosi Inkosikazi
text: sitting across from him with a big smile.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 7 EXT. YARD - DAY 7
text: Inkosi Inkosikazi enters the Buick. The Boy and his
text: smiling nanny watch. They Boy still holds the chicken.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: Inkosi Inkosikazi said the spirit
dialog: of the great Zulu warriors lived
dialog: in me. He told me that whenever
dialog: trouble arose I should return to
dialog: the waterfall and keep stepping
text: across the rocks until the trouble
dialog: passed. He said three rocks were
dialog: enough to conquer my problem with
dialog: the night water; that I was very
dialog: brave. He said I was a man for
dialog: all Africa, bound to her by my
dialog: spirit, bound by my dreams.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And he let me keep the chicken.
text: The Boy and his nanny watch the car go off in a cloud of
dialog: dust.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 8 EXT. VELDT - DAY 8
text: The Boy sits on a train looking out the window at the
text: veldt and the wildlife moving across in the distance.
text: A sack on his lap moves. The chicken's head pops out.
text: The Boy gives him some kernels of corn and scratches
text: behind his scraggly comb.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: Although I was bound by spirit
dialog: 6.
dialog: and dream to Africa, I was bound
dialog: by heritage and language to the
dialog: birthplace of my grandparents --
dialog: England -- a country I had never
dialog: seen, but one that was to cause
dialog: me eminently more problems than
dialog: bedwetting ever did.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 9 EXT. ROAD TO SCHOOL 9
text: A motorcar driving along the road to the school.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: The school I was sent to was
dialog: attended and staffed entirely by
dialog: Afrikaaners, the oldest of the two
dialog: white tribes of Africa.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 10 INT. SCHOOL 10
text: The six-year-old walks timorously through the halls,
text: filled with bigger boys -- brash, noisy, hostile. They
dialog: only speak the "Taal" -- Afrikaans. Over and over they
text: jostle or verbally deride the six-year-old, knocking his
text: books down so that when he bends to pick them up he is
text: kicked in the butt. Or pulling his shirt out from under
text: his jacket and making it hard to move.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: I spoke only English. The hated
dialog: tongue. The language of the enemy
dialog: who had usurped power and stolen
dialog: the country through political
dialog: chicanery and military brutality.
text: A mob of boys, led by a big bully, JAAPIE BOTHA, runs
text: the six-year-old through the bathroom and into the
text: showers, fully clothed. He tries to run out. Jaapie
text: Botha grabs him and throws him back in, holding him with
text: one ham-fisted hand under the shower head and turning the
text: shower on with the other. The six-year-old stands
text: miserable as the stinging water pelts him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: During the Boer War of 1896,
dialog: 26,000 Boer women and children
text: were herded into detainment camps
dialog: by the British, where they died
text: like flies from dysentery,
dialog: 7.
dialog: malaria and black water fever.
dialog: And it seemed I was destined to
dialog: shoulder the responsibility for
dialog: each and every one of those
dialog: deaths.
text: The six-year-old in his first soccer game receives the
text: ball. He tries to move upfield, but he is kicked and
text: pushed, the ball taken from him. He gets up gamely to
text: follow the chase, only to be flattened, blindsided by
dialog: Jaapie Botha.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: And no one made this more evident
dialog: to me than Jaapie Botha, a wheat
dialog: farmer's son from the Transvaal.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 11 INT. DORMITORY 11
text: The six-year-old, asleep, his chicken perched alertly
text: atop the bed.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: The only time I was at peace was
dialog: when I slept. Inkosi Inkosikazi's
dialog: chicken proved to be, like his
text: previous owner, a salvation.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 12 EXT. REAR OF DORMITORY - DAY 12
text: The Boy builds a small shelter for the CHICKEN, who
text: CLUCKS and forages contentedly.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: During the day he would live
text: outside the dorm, happily scarfing
text: down bugs and grubs, secure in a
dialog: little house I built for him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 13 INT. DORM - NIGHT 13
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: And at night he would hop through
text: the window and, perching over my
text: bed, squawking if any intruders
dialog: came near.
dialog: 8.
text: Several boys sneak up in the dark. The CHICKEN begins
text: to CHATTER. The six-year-old wakes, a shoe in hand
text: ready to throw. The shadows scatter. The Boy gives the
text: chicken a few grains of corn and an affectionate scratch
text: behind the ear, and goes back to sleep.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: He was my best and only friend.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 14 INT. SCHOOL 14
text: Boys and faculty running through the halls excitedly,
text: showing newspapers with pictures of Hitler and
text: Chamberlain on the front. Posters and slogans with
text: swastikas are slapped up on walls. Some boys mimic
text: "heiling" to each other.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
dialog: I'm sure in time a status quo
dialog: would have been achieved between
dialog: me and my schoolmates were it not
dialog: for the cataclysmic events
dialog: occurring in that faraway place
dialog: none of us had ever seen.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Two montjhs after I arrived at
dialog: the school World War II broke out
dialog: in Europe. Hitler had vowed to
dialog: crush the British Empire. The
text: Boers sharpened their swords in
dialog: anticipation.
text: The six-year-old comes back to his bed in the dorm to
text: find a swastika carved into it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 15 INT. DORMITORY - NIGHT 15
text: The six-year-old sleeps fitfully. There is a MUFFLED
text: SQUAWK. He wakes. A blanket is thrown over his head.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 16 INT. DARKENED BASEMENT ROOM 16
text: The Boy is dumped on the floor, the blanket removed. His
text: eyes open in horror. The room is lit by torches.
text: Shadows dance fearfully off two dozen boys with swastika
text: armbands and leather pistol rigs without pistols strapped
text: to their sides. In front of him on a platform Jaapie
text: Botha stands, his shirtsleeves rolled to the shoulder,
dialog: 9.
text: as another student painfully tattoo-scars his arm with
text: a swastika, using a knife and blue dye. Seeing the six-
text: year-old, Jaapie turns his attention to him and
text: addresses him in Afrikaans.
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: God has sent Hitler to deliver us
dialog: from the English bastards who stole
dialog: our country and killed our people.
dialog: Heil Hitler!
text: The other boys chorus in.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Heil Hitler!
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: We will swear a blood oath. When
dialog: Hitler comes we'll rise up and
dialog: kill the Verdomde Rooineks.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: A blood oath! A blood oath!
text: Jaapie bends down and grabs the six-year-old by the
text: shirt front, yanking him up.
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: With your blood.
text: Jaapie slaps the Boy across the mouth three times.
text: Blood flows from his mouth and nose. Jaapie dips his
text: finger in the blood and smears it across his new tattoo.
text: He holds up his bloodied fingers.
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: We swear allegiance to Adolf
dialog: Hitler. Heil Hitler!
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: We swear allegiance to Adolf
dialog: Hitler. Heil Hitler!
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: Death to all Englishmen in South
dialog: Africa. Heil Hitler!
text: The chorus repeats.
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: God bless the fatherland. Heil
dialog: Hitler!
text: The voices come back to him stronger.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Heil Hitler!
text: Jaapie grabs the six-year-old again.
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: See what we have in store for
dialog: you when Hitler comes, Rooinek.
dialog: Hoy!
text: He gives a command. The boys at the far end of the
text: room part. The six-year-old's eyes open in terror.
speaker_heading: 17 HIS POV 17
text: 20 feet away Inkosi Inkosikazi's chicken, his chicken,
text: is hung from a rafter upside down, haplessly flapping
text: against his bonds.
scene_heading: 18 BACK TO SCENE 18
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: No!
text: But before he gets two steps towards the chicken he is
text: gang-tackled and held. Jaapie picks up a sling and a
dialog: rock.
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: For crimes committed against the
dialog: whole Boer people. I, Jaapie
text: Botha, the judge and Uberfuhrer,
dialog: sentence you and your Rooinek
dialog: kaffir chicken to death. Heil
dialog: Hiter.!
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Heil Hitler!
text: Jaapie starts to swing the sling around and around. The
text: six-year-old struggles to get free.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!
text: The SLING WHISTLES through the air, faster and faster.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: No!
text: Jaapie releases the stone. It flies true, catching
text: the SQUAWKING, struggling CHICKEN flush in the chest.
text: The flapping stops as blood soaks through feathers.
dialog: 11.
text: Jaapie flings his hand forward, victorious.
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: Heil Hitler!
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Heil Hitler!
text: The Boy takes the opportunity to break loose. He rushes
text: Jaapie, whose arm is outstretched, putting him off
text: balance. The Boy catches him low, driving his head into
text: Jaapie's exposed stomach. Jaapie falls back and gets
text: the knife used for his tattooing right in his ass.
text: Jaapie Botha bellows like an enraged bull as he grabs
text: futiley for the embedded blade. His cohorts laugh,
text: thinking it tremendously funny, until Jaapie removes
text: the knife and turns with it, dripping his own blood, his
text: eyes murderous. The laughter dies. Jaapie's breath
dialog: comes hard.
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: Hang him up!
text: A few boys protest.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Jaapie! No!
text: But Botha is murderous, intent on revenge.
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: Hang him!
text: He waves the bloody knife in the air. Three boys grab
text: the six-year-old and drag him to where the chicken is
text: hanging. Two more boys throw a rope over the same
text: rafter. Others bind the struggling boy, trussing his
text: hands to his sides.
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: You will pay for the deaths of
dialog: our grandfathers and grandmothers,
dialog: our aunts and uncles. All
dialog: Rooineks will pay and you will be
dialog: first. Pull!
text: The boys who tied the rope now yank it over the rafter.
text: The six-year-old is hoisted up until he is eye-level with
dialog: the chicken.
speaker_heading: JAAPIE
dialog: In the name of Adolf Hitler and
dialog: the fatherland, I sentence you to
dialog: die, Verdomde Rooinek.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
text: Jaapie swings the sling overhead, faster and faster.
scene_heading: 19 ANGLE ON SIX-YEAR-OLD 19
text: He watches as Jaapie bears down. As Jaapie is about to
text: let the rock fly the door to the room opens and two STAFF
text: MEMBERS burst in, surprising in.
speaker_heading: STAFF MEMBER
dialog: What's this?
text: The rock flies from the sling, but Jaapie's attention is
text: diverted. His aim is off. The rock grazes the boy above
text: the eye. He loses consciousness. The scene FADES TO
speaker_heading: BLACK.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 20 INT. ST. JOHN'S STUDY - DAY 20
dialog: Prince of Wales School, 1950. PK, 17 going on 18, well-
text: built, intense, clear-eyed, handsome, stands in front of
text: a seminar and continues reading to 10 students, honor
dialog: students, Headmaster St. John's chosen few. St. John,
text: with the demeanor of an Oxford don and a mane of snowy
text: white hair that reaches his shoulders, sits off to the
text: side, listening.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I came to after being unconscious
dialog: for two days, the rock missing my
dialog: eye by half an inch. After a week
dialog: in hospital it was decided I'd be
dialog: sent to my grandfather's house in
dialog: the English town of Barberton,
dialog: at least until passions at school
dialog: cooled. Jaapie Botha was expelled;
text: sent home to his family's farm in
text: disgrace.
speaker_heading: PK (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And so the first recorded South
dialog: African casualty of Hitler's
dialog: insanity was not a Boer, nor a
text: Rooinek, but a tatter-feathered,
text: half-bald kaffir chicken.
text: PK finishes. The end of class BELL RINGS. Offstage,
text: other classrooms are exiting into the common hall, but
text: no one in St. John's study moves. St. John takes his
dialog: 13.
text: glasses off and wipes the lenses deliberately. After a
text: long moment he turns to face the class.
speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: Very evocative, yes. Particularly
text: the image of the chicken. Good
dialog: choice there.
text: St. John rises, lecturing.
speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: Any ideology that needs to attack
dialog: the thing that least threatens it
dialog: is an ideology that will not
dialog: outlive its own generation.
dialog: Inclusion, gentlemen, not
dialog: exclusion, is the key to survival.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Something our new government
dialog: should take heed of, eh?
text: His eyes roam from face to face, fixing his point.
speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: Next week we have Mr. Levy who
dialog: will enlighten us on...
text: MORRIE, a bright-eyed kinetic, speaks up.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Sport and wager in Imperial Rome,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: (facetious)
dialog: Very apt, Mr. Levy. We look
dialog: forward to the experience.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: All right.
text: The boys bolt for the door.
speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: P.K.
text: PK approaches.
speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: Well-written.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: I've received notice from the
dialog: 14.
dialog: Oxford selection committee. You
dialog: are to appear before them in
dialog: three weeks. I assume you'll be
dialog: reading a piece of your fiction
dialog: as your presentational.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: A word of caution. Contemporary
dialog: to most of these fellows means
dialog: the seventeenth century. Try and
dialog: keep your theme, um, classical,
dialog: if you know what I mean.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes sir. I will.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Will the scholarship be decided
dialog: at the same time, sir?
speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: Money's a different matter.
dialog: Different committee.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Very good, sir.
text: St. John picks up a book and opens the pages. He begins
text: to read. PK takes it as a cue for his dismissal. He
text: goes to exit.
speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: And P.K...
text: PK turns at the door.
speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: Good luck tonight.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Thank you, sir.
text: St. John returns to his book. PK exits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 21 EXT. HALL 21
text: Morrie waits in the now nearly-empty hall, taking some
text: money from another boy and making notations in a black
text: book. PK comes up to him.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: How we doing?
text: Morrie consults the book.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: You win and your dream comes true.
dialog: You lose, we're back to bread
dialog: and butter sandwiches till term's
dialog: end. What'd he want?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: My appointement before the Oxford
dialog: committee came through.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
text: A snap.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: For a brain like you, maybe.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Come on, you'll read one of your
dialog: pieces, they'll be begging you to
dialog: attend.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: But will they pay for the
dialog: privilege?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Well let's bloody hope so. It'll
dialog: be a lonely time without you
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Morrie Levy. Is that the voice
dialog: of sentimentality I hear coming
dialog: from you?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Sentimentality my ass.
dialog: Practicality. Where am I going
dialog: to find a sure thing like you to
dialog: make book on at bloody Oxford?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Go on.
text: He shoves Morrie playfully out the door and follows.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: 22 INT. LONG HALLWAY - CLOSEUP - PK AND MORRIE 22
text: as they walk down the long hall looking straight ahead.
text: Sweat dapples PK's face. Both boys are focused on
text: double doors at the end of the hall. There is the
text: distant MUFFLED sound of a CROWD CHEERING.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: You hear Sutcliffe screwed
dialog: Bartlett's sister when he stayed
dialog: with them over holidays?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I don't believe it.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: I heard it from Bartlett's own
dialog: lips. He's selling reservations
dialog: for next holiday. A pound for
dialog: one night; three pounds for four.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You register?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: For both of us. Took the whole
dialog: holiday.
text: The CHEERING crowd grows LOUDER the closer they get to
text: the double doors.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: You nervous?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Christ! I'm about to have a calf.
dialog: This bloody Boer gets lucky,
dialog: we're in the poorhouse.
text: They reach the double doors. Still in CLOSEUP, Morrie
text: turns to face PK for the first time.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Now remember. We're not here to
dialog: exhibit our wares. We go in, we
dialog: do the job, we get out. Right?
text: PK is so focused his eyes seem to bore through the doors.
text: He does not move his head a hair.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Right.
dialog: 17.
text: Morrie and PK draw a deep breath. Together they push
text: open the double doors. Together they stride into a
text: floodlit, fully-packed sports arena and head down the
text: fan-lined aisle to the raised boxing ring in the center.
text: Schoolboys in their respective school blazers, Afrikaan
text: and English, yell, whistle and clap. PK and Morrie,
text: in FULL FRAME, reveal PK in a boxing robe with taped
text: hands, and Morrie with towel and bucket.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: And at the end of six matches in
dialog: all weight divisions, the score
dialog: is Prince of Wales three victories,
dialog: Helpmakeer three victories.
text: The stands explode with cheers.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: And now for the final bout to
dialog: determine which school will win
dialog: the Johannesburg 1950 public
dialog: school boxing team championship.
dialog: In this corner, weighing 140
dialog: pounds, standing 5'8", from the
dialog: Helpmakeer School with a record of
dialog: 13-0 on the year, Jannie
dialog: Geildenhaus.
text: A huge cheer goes up for JANNIE, muscular, bare-chested,
text: as he dances and shadowboxes for the crowd.
text: PK enters the ring. He stands, robe on, eyes intent on
text: Jannie. When the noise subsides the Announcer continues.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: And in this corner, representing
dialog: the Prince of Wales School, the
dialog: current Johannesburg Public School
dialog: welterweight champion, also with
dialog: a record of 13-0 on the year, also
dialog: 140 pounds, Kid P.K.
text: Now the English schoolboys cheer for their man, but PK
text: does not respond. He barely moves. He raises an arm in
text: bare acknowledgment. His attention stays focused across
text: the ring on his shadowboxing opponent. PK watches Jannie
text: dance closely when a low CHANTING begins from outside the
text: stadium -- African, tribal, mystical harmonies of black
text: voices building until the white voices inside the stadium
text: are stunned to silence. The song carries beautifully in
text: the night. For the first time PK's focus is broken, but
text: not like the others in the audience, who haven't a clue
dialog: as to what's happening. He has heard this before. This
text: is familiar.
dialog: 18.
text: This is for him. A distant knowing flickers in his eyes
text: like a man who has heard the voice of fate whisper his
dialog: name.
text: Over and over, one phrase is indistinguishable -- the
text: chorus of the song. "Ono bi shobi ingelosi." The
text: chanting stops as suddenly as it began. A moment passes
text: before the crowd begins to buzz with the phenomenon.
text: The Announcer attempts to bring everyone's attention
dialog: back to the business at hand.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: We thank the native population for
text: their spirited display of
dialog: enthusiasm. But now, on to the
dialog: main event. Fighters to center
dialog: ring, please.
text: PK, focused again, meets Jannie at the REFEREE.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: You both know the rules. No
text: butts, no elbows, no low blows.
dialog: First man to score three knock
dialog: downs wins. Let's have a good
dialog: clean fight. Good luck to you.
text: The fighters slap leather. PK turns back to his corner
text: when his focus is broken dramatically by a face in the
dialog: crowd.
scene_heading: 23 HIS POV - FRONT ROW - HALF-DOZEN SCHOOLGIRLS 23
text: sit; one of them MARIA ELIZABETE MARAIS, 17, with honey-
text: blonde hair and lapis-blue eyes, turns her head and
text: engages PK's eyes and his heart. She quickly looks
text: away. But a connection has been made -- fire passed.
speaker_heading: 24 PK 24
text: goes back to his corner and takes off his robe. Morrie
text: stands, holding PK's mouthpiece.
speaker_heading: PK
text: First row, third from the left.
dialog: Find out who she is.
text: Morrie looks down at Maria.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: We're in a bloody war here, in
dialog: 19.
dialog: case you forgot. Let's keep our
dialog: mind on that, hey?
text: He jams the mouthpiece into PK's mouth as the BELL RINGS.
text: PK turns to an onslaught by Jannie, a real brawler.
text: Jannie's big, overhand rights almost nail PK until he
text: finds his footing and dances away. Jannie comes after
text: him hard, his schoolmates bellowing encouragement. But
text: PK's far superior boxing skills put Jannie at an immed-
text: iate disadvantage. It is a classic battle of a boxer
text: versus a fighter. PK's jabs keep Jannie at an arm's
text: length, until he closes with a combination. Jannie,
text: willing to take three punches to land one, absorbs PK's
dialog: point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout
text: punches. When he has had enough punishment he lunges
text: into a clinch.
speaker_heading: JANNIE
dialog: Blery Rooinek. I'll kill you.
text: PK pushes off as Jannie hammers at his kidneys. Backing
text: up, PK repays the compliment with two quick jabs to the
text: face. PK works Jannie, turning him left then right,
text: working the angles, keeping him off balance while he
text: racks up the points. Jannie goes left. As PK chases
text: him that way his eyes fix on something out of the ring.
scene_heading: 25 HIS POV - REAR EXIT DOOR - TALL BLACK MAN 25
text: with a younger black companion of more average height,
text: the only black faces in a crowd of 2,000 people.
scene_heading: 26 BACK TO SCENE 26
text: Their presence distracts PK for a split second, and in
text: that split second Jannie seizes the opportunity. He
text: comes across with a big right hand to PK's jaw. Jannie
text: connects. PK goes down hard. The crowd goes wild.
text: Morrie leaps up and down in the corner.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Get up! Get up!
text: But PK is seeing double. He shakes his head, trying to
dialog: clear it.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Up! Up!
scene_heading: 27 PK'S POV - JANNIE 27
text: dancing in his corner, sensing victory, the Ref over
dialog: 20.
text: him, counting.
scene_heading: 28 BACK TO SCENE 28
text: PK forces himself up. The Ref checks him.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Okay. Fight.
text: Jannie comes rushing in, banging PK with a series of
text: hard rights, but dropping his left each time he throws
text: one. PK absorbs the punishment as best he can, backing
text: up, dancing away. Jannie is all over him just as the
text: BELL RINGS. Jannie goes back to his corner, triumphant.
text: PK goes back to his and sits down with a blank ex-
text: pression. Morrie goes to work on a small cut over
text: his eye.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: What are you trying to do,
dialog: bankrupt us? What happened?
text: PK turns and looks at the two Africans at the rear door.
text: Morrie's eyes follow him, tensing as he sees the two men.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Christ! If they get caught in
dialog: here they're dead.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What the hell's going on?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Well, worry about it later. In
dialog: case you haven't noticed, this
dialog: Boer bastard is trying to kill
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You see the way he drops his left
dialog: when he throws the right?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Yeah?
text: The BELL RINGS. PK and Morrie trade a look. Jannie
text: comes rushing over and throws a big right. PK steps to
text: his own right side and pops Jannie right over his dropped
text: left hand. He looks at Morrie again.
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: 29 ANGLE ON MORRIE 29
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Thank you, God.
text: Jannie comes after PK, paying for each big right he
text: throws as PK finds his mark. PK plants one, then two,
text: then three punches on Jannie's face. Finally, frus-
text: trated, Jannie forsakes all pretense of boxing and tries
text: to nail PK with wild, flailing blows. PK bobs and weaves
text: and feints. Jannie's punches grow weary. PK begins
text: to bear down, driving his man back with rapid-fire com-
text: binations until he delivers the coup de grace, a left
text: hook to the heart and a driving right uppercut. Jannie
text: goes down in a heap. The crowd goes wild. The Referee
text: counts him out. Jannie's seconds rush into the ring to
text: lift their fallen fighter. Morrie also rushes in,
text: followed by the Prince of Wales boxing team. They hoist
text: PK up on their shoulders.
scene_heading: 30 PK'S POV - MARIA MARAIS 30
text: rising from her seat, and leaving with the other girls.
text: Their eyes meet. Her hint of a smile breaks his heart.
text: She disappears in the crowd.
scene_heading: 31 BACK TO SCENE 31
text: PK's eyes rise to the rear exit. The tall African and
text: his companion have vanished.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 32 INT. LOCKER ROOM 32
text: The boxing team and a number of their supporters are in
text: raucous celebration. Morrie comes bouncing through the
text: crowd, until he enters the empty dressing room in the
text: rear, where PK is getting dressed. Morrie takes a wad
text: of money out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Here you go, pal.
text: He hands PK the money.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You're the treasurer of this
dialog: company. You hold it. Did you
dialog: find out what I asked for?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: 22.
dialog: Uh, listen, P.K. You know in this
dialog: world there is no greater proponent
dialog: of sins of the flesh than Morrie
dialog: Levy. But do yourself a favor on
dialog: this one. Take my advice. Pass.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Thanks for the advice. The
dialog: information please.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Do you know who her father is?
dialog: Professor Daniel Marais.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: So? He's the Nationalist Party's
dialog: resident intellectual. The man is
dialog: one of the architects of this
dialog: damned system of -- what are they
dialog: calling it? -- apartheid? He has
dialog: about as much use for a Rooinek
text: Englishman rutting after his
dialog: daughter as the Queen does for
dialog: balls, pardon my French.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: What's her name and where do I
dialog: find her?
text: Morrie sighs.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Maria Elizabete Marais, Seniors
dialog: Cottage, Room 22, Devilliers
dialog: School. They don't call it
dialog: 'Fortress Virgin' for nothing.
dialog: You'll never get in.
text: PK slips his school blazer on.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You going to take book on that?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Already have. Three-to-one says
dialog: you don't.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Where'd you bet?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: I took a big position you do.
dialog: 23.
text: PK smiles at his friend and starts to leave. Morrie
text: stuffs some banknotes in his breast pocket.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: In case you have to bail yourself
dialog: out.
text: PK boxes him around playfully and skips out, running the
text: gauntlet of the celebration outside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 33 EXT. DEVILLIERS SCHOOL FOR GIRLS - NIGHT 33
text: Indeed, "Fortress Virgin." Surrounded by a high stone
text: wall, the school's gothic towers loom medieval in the
text: African moonlight. A security guard mans the front gate.
text: PK takes a route through shadows and shrubs, searching
text: for a way in. He finds one in a tree whose massive limbs
text: reach over the wall. In a flash PK is up the tree and
text: over the wall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 34 EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS 34
text: PK makes his way through the darkened campus. A few stu-
text: dents and some staff are about. PK hugs the shadows as
text: best he can. PK passes a statue dominating the quad --
dialog: a Boer family from the last century; the man looking for-
text: ward, his gun braced for action; the women and children
text: at his shoulder, brave, resolute.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 35 EXT. SENIOR COTTAGE 35
text: PK comes up to the cottage where a few girls can be seen
text: through the windows studying at lamplit desks or readying
text: for bed. Other rooms are already dark. PK slips inside
dialog: the building.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 36 INT. BUILDING 36
text: PK moves along the hall looking for room 22.
text: He is about to turn a corner when TWO GIRLS chattering in
text: Afrikaans come down a staircase. PK backs into a
dialog: 24.
text: darkened room to his left. The girls appear in robes
text: with towels and toiletries and step into the same room.
text: One flicks on the light to reveal the shower room -- 14
text: separate cubicle stalls. Still chattering, the girls
text: disrobe.
scene_heading: 37 ANGLE ON PK 37
text: pressed hard against the inside wall of a stall with a
text: clear view of the proceedings. He holds his breath as
text: one of the girls heads towards his stall. Her girl-
text: friend cautions her.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Those are always cold. Use this
dialog: one.
text: The girl turns away to another stall just in time. The
text: SHOWERS START. PK allows himself to breathe again. He
text: exits quickly.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 38 INT. ROOM 38
text: Maria Marais sits at her desk in a nightgown, working on
text: a paper, when there is a KNOCK on the door. With her
text: mind still on her work, she opens the door. Her eyes go
text: wide with shock when she sees PK. He puts a cautionary
text: finger to his lips.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: May I come in?
text: Maria, frozen with surprise, steps back. PK enters,
text: gently closing the door behind him.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I'm sorry to scare you.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: You can't be here.
text: She speaks in Afrikaan-accented English.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I didn't know how else to meet you.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I could be expelled.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: 25.
dialog: Girls don't usually come to boxing
dialog: matches.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: We went on a dare. Please.
text: PK ignores her anxiety.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Did you like it?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: It was...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ... exciting. You were very good.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: (in Afrikaans)
dialog: Thank you. I'm glad I impressed
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: You speak the Taal.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I'll speak Zulu if it'll help me
dialog: see you again.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I need my father's permission.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Is it hard to get?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Hard for an Afrikaaner boy.
dialog: Impossible for an English one.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: How about your permission? Do
dialog: I have that?
text: Maria blushes.
text: All of a sudden there is a KNOCK on the door. Maria
text: starts. PK moves quickly behind the door as it opens to
scene_heading: TWO GIRLS.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: GIRL #1
dialog: We're having coffee upstairs.
dialog: Want to come?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I have to finish this paper.
speaker_heading: GIRL #2
dialog: Come when you're finished. We'll
dialog: be up late.
text: They close the door. Maria reinforces it with her body.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Please go.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You didn't answer my question.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: There are plenty of English girls.
dialog: What makes me so important?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: The way I felt when I saw you.
text: He is so direct she can only blush deeper. Her response
text: is indirect but affirmative.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: My father will insist on meeting
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I can't wait.
text: O.S., the outside door to the dorm opens. A matron's
text: voice calls out.
speaker_heading: MATRON (V.O.)
dialog: Lights out, ladies.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Now please.
text: PK opens her window and starts to climb out.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: (in Afrikaans)
dialog: Good night, Maria Marais.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (in English)
dialog: Good night, PK.
dialog: 27.
text: PK pauses.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I don't remember telling you my
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: And I don't remember telling you
dialog: mine.
text: PK smiles back at her. He drops to the ground. Maria
text: closes the window and watches him scoot across the
text: campus until he is swallowed by the night.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 39 INT. MARAIS HOUSE 39
text: An ample house. PAN ACROSS a gallery of oil paintings
dialog: depicting great moments in Boer history -- the Great Trek,
text: an endless progression of oxcarts heading north, the
dialog: Battle of Blood River against the Zulu armies, the hang-
text: ing of Boer farmers by British regulars. Women and
text: children herded into a detention camp as their farms burn
text: in the background. Boer kommandos sniping at a British
text: column on the veldt.
text: PAN FROM the pictures TO photographs, sepia-toned, his-
text: torical, and DR. DANIEL MARAIS and PK, strolling past the
text: pictures. Marais points to a photo of a young Boer, turn
text: of the century, posed stiffly with a rifle in the slouched
text: hat of a Boer kommando.
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: Jan Piet Marais. My uncle. At
dialog: 22 he led a kommando for three
dialog: years before your people caught
dialog: him and hung him.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: My people?
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: The English.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I consider myself an African, sir.
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: As do I. As do the Zulu, the
dialog: Xhosa, the Pongo, the Ndebele.
dialog: We're all Africans. But all from
dialog: separate tribes, ay?
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Unfortunately.
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Because it's the whole tribal
dialog: idea that creates our problems
dialog: here in South Africa.
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: The problems of South Africa, my
dialog: boy, do not come from tribalism.
text: They come from counter-tribalism.
dialog: From people insisting that natural
dialog: laws which have been in place and
dialog: operating since God's creation,
dialog: should be tampered with. Does
dialog: the gazelle sleep with the lion?
dialog: Does the rhino graze with the
dialog: mouse? The separation of things
dialog: is not coincidental. Do you think
dialog: a Zulu wants to see his culture,
text: his sense of identity, replaced by
dialog: someone else's anymore than I do?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: No, sir. But I don't think he
dialog: wants being a Zulu to mean he is
dialog: denied the same rights as
dialog: everyone else has.
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: Which is why civilization is
dialog: defined by the ability to live
dialog: under the rule of law. Laws
dialog: define rights.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: But do they define justice?
speaker_heading: MARAIS
text: Ah. Justice. The banner behind
dialog: which the English marched as they
dialog: gobbled up a quarter of the world?
dialog: Justice, my boy, is only relative
dialog: to who's in charge.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: And how long they stay in charge
dialog: is only relative to how well they
dialog: dispense that justice...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ... with all due respect.
dialog: 29.
text: Marais fixes PK with a stare. PK's eyes meet his evenly,
text: unwavering. Maria enters.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Papa, would you like coffee in the
dialog: library or the parlor?
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: (pleasant)
dialog: The library, mein leib.
text: Maria smiles at PK and exits. He leads PK towards the
dialog: library.
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: I can't figure out if you're
dialog: brave or foolish.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Why is that, sir?
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: You come here to ask for permission
dialog: to see my daughter. Correct?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: And knowing who I am, what I stand
dialog: for, do you think this sort of
dialog: discussion is going to put that
dialog: request in a favorable light?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I thought a man of your intellectual
dialog: reputation wouldn't want his
dialog: daughter seeing someone who didn't
dialog: think.
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: Let me give you some advice then.
dialog: You're right. I admire a keen
dialog: mind. But intellectual reputation
dialog: or not, I am first a Marais, a
dialog: member of the Volk.
speaker_heading: MARAIS (CONT'D)
dialog: And if you're trying to impress a
dialog: member of the Volk with your
dialog: intellect, don't do it espousing
dialog: liberal ideas picked up in an
dialog: English private school.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: These ideas I picked up somewhere
dialog: else.
text: Marais opens the library door.
speaker_heading: MARAIS
dialog: (joking)

scene_heading: 40 EXT. ROCK OUTCROPPING - DAY 40
text: A brilliant African sun beats down on the veldt below.
text: On the rock, a seven-year-old PK sits looking somewhat
text: sadly over the landscape. A long shadow covers him.
text: The CLICK of a CAMERA is heard. PK turns, shielding his
text: eyes with his hand against the glare of the sun to a
text: tall, white-haired figure, shirtless, in hiking boots
text: and kneesocks, holding a box camera.
speaker_heading: DOC (FIGURE)
dialog: Ja. Perfect. You will excuse me,

text: DOC, speaking in German-accented English, moves off from

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: This I do not normally without
dialog: permission do, ja? But to catch
dialog: the expression. After all, it is
dialog: the expression that is important.
dialog: Ja? Without the expression the

dialog: You have some problems, I think.
dialog: I am Professor Karl von Vollensteen.

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I'm P.K.
text: He holds out his hand. Doc takes it.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Such a young person with such an
dialog: 31.
dialog: old expression. I think we can
dialog: be friends. Ja?
text: Eighteen-year-old PK narrates.
speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)
dialog: That was how I met Doc, as he
dialog: insisted I call him. A chance
text: meeting between a directionless
text: seven-year-old boy and an old
dialog: German professor out collecting
text: cacti on the African bush veldt.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So began my education.
text: Doc and PK walk the veldt across craggy mountain trails,
text: down dry river beds, through the jungle, always collecting
dialog: cacti and aloe samples, Doc always talking, always
dialog: explaining.
speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)
dialog: Doc believed the brain had two
dialog: functions and that the South
dialog: African public school system
dialog: unfortunately dealt with only one.
speaker_heading: DOC
text: The brain, P.K., has two functions.
dialog: It is the best reference library
dialog: ever, which is a good thing to
dialog: have. Ja? But also from it comes
dialog: original thought. In school you
dialog: will get all filled up with the
dialog: facts. Here your brain will learn
dialog: where to look, how to look, how
dialog: to think. And then you will have
dialog: for yourself all the brains that
dialog: have ever been.
text: Doc and PK sit high up. PK watches the endless animal
text: migration below while Doc points things out across the
dialog: landscape.
speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)

speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)
dialog: Until he was fifty, Doc had a

dialog: This one plant has all the
dialog: blessings He tried but failed to
dialog: give man. It is true. Look.
text: The cactus is humble but not
dialog: submissive. It grows where no
dialog: other plant will grow. The sun
text: bakes its back, the wind rips it
dialog: from cliffs, or drowns it in the
text: dry desert sand. Not a complaint.
dialog: In good times or bad it will
text: still flower. It protects itself
dialog: from danger.
text: Doc touches a cactus needle.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: But it harms no other plant. It
dialog: 33.
dialog: has patience and solitude and
dialog: modesty. In Mexico there is a
text: cactus that blooms once in a
dialog: hundred years and then only at
dialog: night. That is saintliness of
dialog: the highest order I think. Ja?
dialog: From cactus comes medicine to
dialog: heal the wounds of men and little
dialog: buttons if you eat one you can
dialog: touch the face of God or stare
dialog: into the mouth of hell. It is
dialog: the plant of patience, solitude,
dialog: love, and madness. Modesty,
dialog: beauty. Toughness and gentleness.
dialog: Of all the plants I think it is
dialog: closest to God. Ja?
speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)

scene_heading: 48 EXT. BARBERTON - DAY 48
text: TRACK THROUGH Barberton, a small town on the low veldt,
text: in all its colonial backwater splendor.
speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)
dialog: Barberton was a very proper
text: English town with a proper square,
text: a wide main street, and the
text: colonials' overblown patriotism
dialog: for a homeland most people had
text: never seen, hanging in the air
text: like fine dust. Not quite seen,
dialog: but there nonetheless.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 49 INT. CONCERT HALL 49
text: PK plays "God Save the King" on the stage. The town's
text: population stands -- the men, stoic; the women, dewey-
text: eyed, at patriotic attention. Some people file out --
text: the men in officers' uniforms of the South African penal
text: system and their wives -- Boers. They exit to the dagger
text: stares and some undertoned hissing and booing from Her
dialog: Majesty's loyal subjects.
speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)
dialog: The only Afrikaaners to live in
dialog: Barberton were sent there to work
dialog: at the government prison, just
dialog: outside town. Germany had
dialog: covertly supported the Boers in
dialog: their two unsuccessful wars
dialog: against British rule, supplying
dialog: food and medical supplies as well
text: as ample stocks of ammunition.
speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)(CONT'D)
dialog: Germany was an old friend, a
dialog: trusted friend. And in a country
text: where a handshake is a friendship
dialog: and a friendship a bond for life,
dialog: as the war in Europe grew fiercer
dialog: tensions in Barberton heated up.
text: Suspicion was afoot. Spies were
dialog: everywhere.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 50 EXT. ROAD TO DOC'S COTTAGE - DAY 50
text: Doc and PK walk toward the cottage. Doc reads PK's

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Grammar: satisfactory. Science:
dialog: satisfactory. Mathetmatics:
dialog: satisfactory.
text: He looks down at PK.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: P.K., if there is one thing I
dialog: know you to be that is a lot more
dialog: than just satisfactory. Ja?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: But I don't want to be known as
text: a brain.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Who do you think gets beaten up
dialog: on all the time in school?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: My boy, to be smart is not a
dialog: sin. But to be smart and not use
dialog: it, that is sin number one. And
dialog: as for getting beat up on, use
dialog: your brain to figure out how not
dialog: to be.
text: He hands PK the report card, his displeasure obvious.
text: As they crest the hill the cottage comes INTO VIEW
text: along with a parked Army car and two armed soldiers
text: leaning against it. Seeing Doc and PK, the soldiers
text: smarten up, raising their rifles and advancing.
text: Doc's face grows pale, his lips tight. PK pulls close to
dialog: him for support.
speaker_heading: DOC
text: Again it begins. The stupidity.
dialog: Do not be frightened.
text: Doc puts na arm around PK's shoulder, drawing him close,

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: 51 EXT. BARBERTON PRISON 51
text: A car pulls up. Doc, in shackles, is escorted from the

text: the doorway to the prison, a square in the looming gates.
text: Doc walks, his head held high. PK walks alongside
text: holding his hand.
speaker_heading: BRITISH OFFICER (V.O.)

text: At the door a guard touches PK's shoulder, holding him

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 52 INT. PK'S ROOM - NIGHT 52
text: Morrie lies in bed, asleep. PK sits up at his desk,
dialog: writing.
speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)
dialog: And again I was alone with nothing
dialog: to depend on to see me through
dialog: except the power of one.
text: PK puts down his pen and sits, regarding the pages. He
text: raises his eyes to a photo on the desk of a boy on a
dialog: rock.
text: PK smiles at hidden memories, caps his fountain pen,
text: turns off the light. The room is pitched into darkness.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 53 EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY - AFTERNOON 53

speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Look, even if the scholarship
dialog: doesn't come through, my old man
dialog: said he'd lend you the money.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Morrie.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: All right. All right. We'll call
dialog: it the 'Levy Carpet Emporium
dialog: Scholarship for Poor but Proud
dialog: Christian Gentlemen.' How's
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Tell your father I appreciate the
dialog: offer.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: God, I hate people who can't be
dialog: bought.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: I don't know. Personality
dialog: disorder.
text: PK nods in agreement.
speaker_heading: PK
text: Undoubtedly.
text: The boys come to their destination marked by a rickety,
text: faded sign: "GOLDMAN'S GYM." Excitement shines in PK's
text: eyes. He bounds up the narrow flight of stairs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 54 INT. STAIRCASE 54
text: Morrie and PK rush up the stairs, stop at the landing,
text: and collect themselves before opening the door to the
text: gym. They take a breath and enter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 55 INT. GYM 55
text: A down and dirty boxing gym, humming with the rhythm of
dialog: 39.
text: men training. Sweat and smoke fill the air along with
text: the faint scent of blood. Fighters, both black and
text: white, train with each other. Morrie is amazed.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: How do they get away with this?
text: But PK has his mind on other things. His eyes fix on
text: an OLD MAN across the room standing by ringside.
speaker_heading: PK
text: There he is.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Christ, he's old.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: And he's the best. C'mon.
text: PK leads Morrie across the gym. PK passes an African
text: fighter. He stops training when he sees PK. He turns
text: to another African fighter, glancing at PK. One by one
text: the blacks in the gym stop training to look at PK. PK
text: and Morrie approach the rheumy Old Man yelling at the
text: two fighters in the ring above him in a thick Polish-
dialog: Jewish accent.
speaker_heading: SOLLY (OLD MAN)
dialog: No, no. God gave you two hands so
dialog: you can knock a man out from
text: either side. Left-right.
text: He moves his creaky body back and forth to demonstrate.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Mr. Goldman?
text: Solly turns to the boys. A look of bemusement comes over
text: his face when he sees their blazers.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: What? You boys lost?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I'm the one who called you
dialog: yesterday. From the Prince of
dialog: Wales School?
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: Oh yeah, yeah. The champeen.
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Right.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: And who are you?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
text: The champeen's manager.
text: Solly rolls his eyes to heaven.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: Oy gevalt.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know you train here it's not
dialog: like those nice school fights
dialog: you're used to. Three knockdowns
dialog: you win.
text: Just then, as if to underscore his point, one of the
text: fighters in the ring gets caught witha solid shot to the
text: jaw. He hits the canvas inches from where they are
text: standing. Solly, PK and Morrie all look at him, and then
text: at each other.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: What does it cost for you to train
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: For my personal attentinons, Mr.
dialog: Manager? Fifty pounds a month.
dialog: For one of them...
dialog: (points to the other
dialog: men working with
dialog: fighters)
dialog: ... less.
text: Morrie pulls out a wad of money and proffers it to Solly.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Here's for six months in advance.
text: Three hundred pounds.
text: Solly pushes the money back.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: Six months? I don't know your
dialog: boy'll last six minutes.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I'll last.
text: Solly notices that every black fighter in the gym has
text: stopped working and is staring at PK.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: 41.
dialog: What are you staring? Punch,
dialog: don't stare. C'mon. Work or
dialog: you're out.
text: The blacks go back to work.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: That your gear?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: Go change in the back. We'll see
dialog: if you couldn't find a better use
dialog: for all that money.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Thank you, sir.
text: PK heads towards the rear. Solly turns to Morrie.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: Why's he want to do this, a nice-
dialog: looking schoolboy?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: He wants to be welterweight champ
dialog: of the world.
text: Solly breaks up laughing.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: Oh sure, sure. And I'd like to
dialog: be twenty-five again.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: You like to make book on it?
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: (joking)
dialog: You giving odds?
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: You name them.
text: Solly gives him a long look.
speaker_heading: SOLLY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 56 INT. GYM - RING 56
text: PK is in the ring getting ready to spar with a well-built
text: opponent. Morrie stands at ringside with Solly.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: Let's just start out nice and
dialog: easy now.
text: He hits the bell. The fighters circle. PK's opponent
text: starts punching, jabbing, probing. After two feints he
text: comes after PK in earnest. PK steps left and peppers
text: him with three quick blows to the face. Solly's interest
text: is suddenly piqued. Again the fighters circle. Again
text: the opponent sets up with jabs and again he attacks.
text: This time PK dodges, hits him hard and spins him around,
text: hitting him twice more. A smile appears on Solly's face.
text: The opponent, angered now, gets more aggressive. PK
text: keeps bobbing and weaving, sticking and slipping punches.
text: The opponent unloads, banging away at PK with everything
text: he has. PK backs up two steps, then shifts positions.
text: The opponent's momentum carries him into the ropes. As
text: he comes off the ropes PK throws him an eight-punch
text: combination, demolishing his opponent. PK steps back.
text: The opponent sags. Solly hits the bell, clearly excited.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: Never I seen someone so young
text: throw an eight-punch combination.
dialog: Where did you learn such a thing?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: In prison, sir.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: You trying to be a comedian and a
dialog: boxer? Mr. Manager, come to my
dialog: office. We'll talk terms. You,

scene_heading: 58 INT. PRISON HALL 58

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: I am Kommandant Von Zyl. The

dialog: To us who respect such learning
dialog: and culture, he is an honored
dialog: guest.
dialog: 44.
text: He hands PK a pass.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: This pass is good for any time,

speaker_heading: PK

dialog: There is not another instrument
dialog: like it in the territory. Maybe
dialog: one day the two of you can give
dialog: a concert for us, hey?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Just then the sound of GRUNTING and THWACKING fills the
text: air. PK passes a room set up as a boxing gym. Through
text: a crack in the door he sees a dozen boys being coached
text: by some guards. Some guards are also being coached by
text: a second man. A third man, LIEUTENANT SMIT, oversees
text: the whole training session. PK watches, mesmerized.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: You like to box?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I would like to learn, meneer.
dialog: Are the boys prisoners?
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No, no. The sons of the guards.
dialog: See that one there?
dialog: (points to a

speaker_heading: SMIT
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: VON ZYL

speaker_heading: SMIT
dialog: He's a little small, Kommandant.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: We'll build him up then.
speaker_heading: SMIT
dialog: Yes, sir. But I really don't
dialog: have anyone to spare to teach him
dialog: right now. You know, with the

speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: There must be someone.
text: Smit looks around the hall.
speaker_heading: 63 HIS POV 63

dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: GEEL PIET
dialog: I teach him best I know, baas.
speaker_heading: SMIT

speaker_heading: VON ZYL

text: The two men step off to the side.
speaker_heading: GEEL PIET
dialog: Don't worry, little baas. Little
dialog: can beat big any day. First with
text: the head, then with the heart.
dialog: Little defeat big when little is
dialog: smart. You can remember that?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: GEEL PIET
dialog: No, no. Don't never call me sir.
dialog: 'Specially in front of the guards.
speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 65 EXT. CARNIVAL 65

scene_heading: 66 ANGLE ON PK AND MARIA 66
text: walking through the carnival, munching popcorn.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You took a big chance talking to

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Not really. Going in I was behind

dialog: I attend a politically suspect
dialog: school. I'm a boxer.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: He likes boxers.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: All men like boxers. But not for
dialog: their daughters. So I had to find
dialog: some way to make an impression.
text: They get on line for the Ferris wheel.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You could have picked a more
dialog: agreeable topic.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: And made much less of an
dialog: impression. Talk to someone
dialog: about their passion. Even if they
dialog: disagree they'll remember you.
dialog: It was really the most logical
dialog: strategy if you think about it.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Do you spend hours thinking
dialog: about how to deal with me, too?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Days.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Know what I think?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: 48.
dialog: You're dangerous.
text: Their turn comes to mount the Ferris wheel. They get
text: into the seat and strap in.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: When I was little we would go to
dialog: my grandfather's farm in the high
dialog: veldt for holiday.
text: The Ferris wheel starts to go up.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: My father would take me to the top
dialog: of the highest hill and we'd play
dialog: this game, 'What Do You See' until
dialog: we ran out of things to see. Do
dialog: you ever play that?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Want to try?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Sure.
text: The Ferris wheel stops to let more people on. Johannesburg
text: glitters beyond.
speaker_heading: MARIA
text: I see a forest. It goes on
text: forever. There are giant trees
dialog: which keep getting bigger and
dialog: bigger over thousands of years.
dialog: Now you.
text: The wheel begins to move a little higher and then stops.
speaker_heading: PK
text: I see little trees growing on the
dialog: forest floor, learning to grow
text: with the little bit of light the
dialog: big trees let in. Now you.
speaker_heading: MARIA
text: I see the big trees getting bigger,
text: their leaves and branches making
text: one great green umbrella over all
dialog: of Africa.
text: The wheel stops again at its highest point.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: 49.
text: I see the sun growing weaker,
text: giving off less light. I see the
dialog: big trees dying because they
dialog: cannot live without a lot of
text: light. I see the little trees
dialog: take over the forest because they
dialog: learn to adapt.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You tell a very good story.
text: Her eyes sparkle, making her irresistible. PK leans
text: forward. Maria turns her face towards him. Her lips
text: part slightly. They kiss tenderly.
text: The CAMERA RISES FROM them TO the star-littered sky
text: twinkling above. The sky goes from black to grey as
text: the CAMERA PANS DOWN.
speaker_heading: GEEL PIET (V.O.)

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Yes, yes, yes. But right now

speaker_heading: GEEL PIET
dialog: Every day I see you bring the

dialog: tobacco leaf.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: It keeps the roots wet.
speaker_heading: GEEL PIET
dialog: What happens to the leaf after?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: A little I use in some water to

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: And the rest we throw away.
text: Geel Piet fidgets. He drops his head, speaking low.
speaker_heading: GEEL PIET
dialog: If you leave the pail when you go
dialog: plant is a problem, small baas?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: GEEL PIET
dialog: Is like this. You see how hard

speaker_heading: GEEL PIET
dialog: No, no. Mustn't do that, little
dialog: baas.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: What Geel Piet means is it can be

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: What's wrong with tobacco? Why

speaker_heading: DOC

speaker_heading: SOLLY
text: Now at the end of the Geel Piet
dialog: eight you do this... one-two...
dialog: (he punches
dialog: the air)
dialog: One-two-three... the Solly Goldman
dialog: thirteen. Okay?
text: PK nods. Solly hits the BELL. The sparring begins. PK
text: works his way in.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: That's it. That's it. Move him

dialog: Now.
text: PK pours it on, laying in the Geel Piet eight. Solly is

speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: And... one-two... one-two-three.
text: PK fires the last three punches like lightning and backs

speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: That's it. That's it. Now work

text: The opponent becomes aggressive. PK starts dancing,
text: slipping punches.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: How do you get away with this,
dialog: Mr. G? Why don't they close you
dialog: down? I mean, there are laws about
text: blacks and white boxing each other.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
text: In a public match. Not in a gym.
dialog: Not yet anyway. The Boer is a
text: funny people. Outside the ring
dialog: the black is not equal. Inside he
dialog: is. But only in private, not in
dialog: public. So I keep my mouth shut,
text: the police go a little blind, and
dialog: that's that. It's a crazy world,
dialog: huh?
text: A WHISTLE from across the gym draws Solly's attention.
text: He and Morrie turn to his office where his assistant
text: stands with the tall black man from the Schoolboy
text: Championships. Solly's face takes on a serious ex-
text: pression. He rings the bell. He turns to Morrie.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
text: Work him on the heavy bag.
text: Solly heads for his office.
scene_heading: 69 ANGLE ON PK 69

speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: With who?
speaker_heading: SOLLY
text: A young guy just turned pro.

speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: A black fighter! They want him

speaker_heading: SOLLY

speaker_heading: MORRIE

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: SOLLY

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: In thirty years I know him,

speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: You're both out of your minds.
speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: SOLLY

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Just talking boxing -- how do I

speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: Pretty even.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: I mean besides getting thrown out

dialog: you fight him you're a pro.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
text: There's no purse being offered.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: That's a good career move. Risk
dialog: everything to gain nothing. Very

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Okay. What's going on?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Well why don't you tell me what
dialog: you do know.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: There's an African myth about an
dialog: outsider who comes one day and
dialog: unites all the tribes into one
dialog: against their oppressors. They
dialog: call it the myth of Onoshobishobi
dialog: Ingelosi -- the tadpole angel.

speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: For you?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I haven't heard it in years.
text: PK begins to disrobe.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: And how did this honor fall on
dialog: your broad back?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I told you about bringing tobacco
dialog: to the prisoners at Barberton?
dialog: Well after that was going for a
dialog: while I learned that even though
dialog: they could send and receive
dialog: letters, they never did. They
dialog: couldn't read or write.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: So you did it for them.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: And after that?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: A clothing program for their

dialog: One thing sort of led to another.

speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: I can see where 'angel' would be

dialog: But it was, uh, this Geel Piet
dialog: who was really behind all of it,
dialog: wasn't it?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: He was very good at pointing

speaker_heading: MORRIE

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: NGUNI

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: What did she read?
speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: That the Onoshobishobi Ingelosi
dialog: who is a chief must fight the
dialog: one who one day will be a chief.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: But it's not true that I'm a
dialog: chief.
speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: Who knows what is true and what is
dialog: not. The legend of Onoshobishobi
dialog: Ingelosi is very powerful among
dialog: the people. They see you box the
dialog: Boer and always you win. They
dialog: have heard the stories from
dialog: Barberton. The people live with
dialog: little hope. They must see if the
text: spirit of the boy still lives in
dialog: the man.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: And if I lose? If the spirit of
dialog: the Onoshobishobi Ingelosi does
dialog: not exist in me anymore, then what

speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: Less hope. But still they must

speaker_heading: POLICE #1

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I mean about how involved you are

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: No I don't.
speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: MARIA

dialog: No you're not.
speaker_heading: PK

text: He kisses her again. This time she responds, kissing him
text: back. The kisses become more passionate, touching, feel-

text: them out of their passion. They cling to the shadows

speaker_heading: LEWIS

text: a pugilist and reading for a
dialog: degree at Oxford a bit, how shall
dialog: we put it, intellectually

dialog: incompatible.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Lord Byron was a boxer, sir. And
dialog: I've never heard anyone question
dialog: his intellectual integrity.
text: One of the other Examiners coughs theatrically to hide
text: his smile. Lewis looks down the table at the man.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: I do not recall Lord Byron
dialog: actually engaging in matches for
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Actually, sir, there are several
dialog: recorded instances of Lord Byron
dialog: engaging in matches for quite
text: large sums of money.
speaker_heading: EXAMINER #2
dialog: Quite right. Yes. In a letter to
dialog: his wife Shelley makes mention of
dialog: just such a thing. For hundreds
dialog: of pounds, actually.
dialog: Lewis has heard enough.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Let's move along, shall we? As
dialog: your presentational you've
dialog: requested to read from a work of
dialog: your own fiction.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Well, then, let us hope we'll be

speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)
dialog: Geel Piet bore no animosity, held
dialog: no hate. Should a guard beat him
dialog: he regarded it as self-inflicted,
dialog: 66.
dialog: the result of some carelessness on
dialog: his part. To survive the system
dialog: he lived in he became an expert in

dialog: the last.
text: All the prisoners are seated on the ground behind Doc,
text: who is raised with the piano on a small stage. Guards
text: surround the prisoners -- a solid, edgy border encasing
text: a black center. The front of the yard is filled with
text: seats on which sit the Kommandant, his wife, assorted
text: prison brass, politicians, and a smattering of the local
text: Afrikaan Hierarchy. PK is overseeing the seating of the
text: prisoners when Doc comes up to him.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Have you seen my page turner?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: No.
text: He asks a prisoner in Zulu.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Have you seen Geel Piet?
text: The man shakes his head. PK looks worried.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (reassuring)
dialog: He will come.
text: The Kommandant, all medals and polished leather, mounts
text: the stage, signaling a beginning to the festivities.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: Where is Bormann? I need Bormann
dialog: to translate to the prisoners.
speaker_heading: SMIT
dialog: I don't know, Kommandant.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Is there a problem here,
dialog: Kommandant?
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: I want to address these filthy
dialog: kaffirs but I don't have a
dialog: translator.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I'll translate.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: You can speak Zulu, PK?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: All right. Listen up.
text: He addresses the prisoners.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: Tell them this concert is the gift
dialog: to them from the professor who,
text: even though he is in prison, is
dialog: not a dirty criminal like them
dialog: but a man of culture and learning.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: The Kommandant welcomes you and
dialog: looks forward to the great
dialog: singing.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: For such a man I am happy to do
dialog: this. But one hair of trouble
dialog: and it's finish.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: He hopes each tribe will sing its
dialog: best and bring honor to its
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: One wrong move and you get marched
dialog: back to your cells and don't come
dialog: out for a month.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: He says tonight let us be one
text: people under the African sky.
text: The prisoners break into spontaneous applause. Von Zyl
text: looks at PK, unsuspecting, pleased.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: You did a good job.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: VON ZYL
dialog: Professor?
text: He turns the stage over to the professor and takes his
text: seat. The professor sits at his stool, poised. PK, in
text: front of the singers, watches him for a cue. Doc drops
text: his head. PK points to a group of singers. MUSIC and
text: VOICE blend spontaneously. "The Concerto for the Great
text: Southland" begins.
text: Doc plays magnificently with great style. PK focuses on
text: leading the singers. Each section, each tribe singing
text: its own songs with its own distinct cultural imprints on
text: rhythm, pace and tone.
scene_heading: 87 CLOSE UP ON PK 87
text: leading the singers in and out of the MUSIC.
scene_heading: 88 FLASH TO TRUNCHEON 88
text: being raised and lowered on a familiar back.
scene_heading: 89 BACK TO SCENE 89
text: PK is caught short by the flash. He falters a bit, then
text: regains his concentration.
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: 90 FLASH TO TRUNCHEON 90
text: coming down on a familiar head -- Geel Peit's.
scene_heading: 91 ANOTHER ANGLE 91
text: Instinctively the first four prisoners in each group,
text: the leaders, stand and turn to face their people. They
text: take up the lead. PK, distracted by his inner vision,
text: runs off stage. Doc looks after him, worried, but keeps
dialog: playing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 92 INT. PRISON 92
text: PK runs through the empty cell blocks looking for some-
text: one. PK runs through the corridors. He runs through the
text: kitchens, the empty dining area, the SOUND of the concert
text: chasing after him.
text: He runs through the recreation area and past the boxing
text: room when he hears a THUD, and another.
scene_heading: 93 INT. BOXING ROOM 93
text: He bolts into the room and hits the light switch. The
text: light over the ring comes on, illuminating Bormann,
text: truncheon raised over the lifeless, broken body of Geel
dialog: Piet.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: No!
text: Startled, Bormann jumps out of the ring and runs off. PK
text: scrambles into the ring and cradles the lifeless, blood-
text: ied head in his lap, and begins to sob.
text: PAN DOWN along Geel Piet's arm to his bloodied hand,
text: holding the snapshot of him and PK.
text: The Concerto grows LOUDER around PK until it enfolds him
text: in its melodies. The voices of Africa, the music of
text: Europe, reaching for a musical and spiritual crescendo.
speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)
dialog: Geel Piet died of massive internal
dialog: hemorrhage, the result of
text: Bormann's ramming a truncheon up
text: into the little man's body until
text: his entrails spilled out. When
text: I reached him he was already dead.
text: I sat there crying, stroking his
text: head and crying with African
dialog: 75.
text: voices rising to heaven above,
text: even as her blood soaked the
text: ground below.
text: The MUSIC SWELLS until the voices meld as one.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 94 INT. EXAMINERS' ROOM 94
text: The four examiners all sit enthralled by the story. When
text: PK looks up, a tear runs down his cheek. Lewis, who is
text: visibly moved, clears his throat. Another man blows his
text: nose with a handkerchief, covering his emotions.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Thank you very much. You will be
dialog: notified as to the University's
dialog: decision by mail.
text: PK rises and goes to exit.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
text: Point of curiousity.
text: PK turns.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Your headmaster told me your work
text: is somewhat autobiographical.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: This Bormann, he was real?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Was justice ever served?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Yes, sir. Sergeant Bormann died
dialog: of cancer...
dialog: (pause)
text: of the rectum.
text: PK turns and exits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 96 INT. CAR 96
text: Solly starts the engine as PK and Morrie hop in.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: We have to make a stop first.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: The night won't last forever,
dialog: boychick.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: It'll only take a minute.
text: Solly puts the car in gear and drives off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 97 INT. MARIA'S ROOM 97
text: Maria is sleeping when a hand goes over her mouth. She
text: awakes, startled, to PK, finger to lips.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 98 EXT. BLACK TOWNSHIP 98
text: A police car patrols the edge of the vast, dark, ram-
text: shackle township, its cruiser light scanning the openings
text: to the dark rutted alleys. It passes and disappears down
text: the road. A moment later an African steps out of the
text: shadows and whistles a signal.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 99 DOWN THE ROAD 99
text: in the shadows, Nguni hears the whistle. He looks at his
text: watch and up the road, tense, as another set of head-
text: lights appears. Nguni steps back into the shadows.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 100 INT. CAR 100
dialog: 77.
text: Solly strains to see out his dirty windshield with the
text: headlights as his car bumps along the unpaved road.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: The night I escaped from the
dialog: Tsar's Army it was just like
dialog: this. Six of us -- four Jews,
text: two Ukranians. Dark as anything.
dialog: No streets. In the day we hid in
dialog: bushes. At night we went.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: You deserted?
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: Whey they come take you at
dialog: thirteen years old and tell you
dialog: it's twenty-five years in the
dialog: Army, it's your duty to desert.
text: Nguni steps out right into the path of the headlights.
text: Solly hits the brake hard, throwing everyone forward.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: You said the end of the road.
speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: Yes, yes. Sorry. I drive.
text: He opens Solly's door with some urgency. Nguni sees
dialog: Maria.
speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Welcome, miss, welcome.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Thank you.
text: Nguni turns into the township and is swallowed by the
text: dark.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 101 INT. CAR 101
text: The car bounces along the rutted darkened streets of the
text: township. The glow of smoldering cooking fires through
text: open doorways offers minimal illumination to the squalid
text: lives within. Maria peers out at a world she has never
text: seen. As the car drives, women and children gather along
text: the road peering in. Mothers point to PK, instructing
dialog: their children.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.
speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: The people have come from
dialog: everywhere to see you.
text: Maria takes PK's hand, a little nervous. PK smiles at
text: her confidently.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Where are the men?
speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: They are to be witness.
text: The muffled sounds of VOICES SINGING reaches them, grow-
text: ing louder as they approach. Maria is tense. Nguni
text: senses this. He turns to her.
speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: No worry, miss. It is the sound
dialog: of happiness.
text: He stops the car at a door in a high wooden wall guarded
text: by two big men.
speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: We are here.
text: Everyone gets out of the car and passes through the door
text: which shuts behind them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 102 INT. DIMLY LIT CORRIDOR 102
text: Nguni leads everyone down the hallway. PK is dressed to
text: fight, hands taped, robe thrown over his shoulders.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: I don't see why we have to weigh
dialog: in. They're going to fight
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: It is very important the people
dialog: see everything is correct.
text: They come to an arch which leads into a big empty room.
text: In the center of the room stands a scale and a dozen
text: Africans, all dressed in worn but neatly pressed suits.
text: Mandoma, the other man who attended PK's fight at school,
text: clad only in boxing gear, waits on PK.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: (in Zulu)
dialog: I see you, Gideon Mandoma.
speaker_heading: MANDOMA
dialog: I see you, PK.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I just want you to know you fight
text: a man. Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is
dialog: just a name I was given at
dialog: Barberton Prison. It means
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: MANDOMA
dialog: It is not for you or me to say
dialog: what it means.
text: An old man, one of the dignitaries says something to
dialog: Nguni.
speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: Please.
text: He motions for PK to step on the scale. PK does. The
text: weight is duly noted. Mandoma then does the same. The
text: twelve men are satisfied. They head for the exit.
speaker_heading: NGUNI
dialog: It is time.
text: He motions for the others to follow. PK goes to walk
text: with Maria. Nguni pairs him with Mandoma. They exit the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 103 INT. CORRIDOR 103
text: The party walks towards a big double door behind which a
text: single VOICE PREACHING can be vaguely heard. Nguni
text: knocks on the door.
scene_heading: 104 EXT. SOCCER FIELD 104
text: The doors open to an entire soccer field jammed with
text: humanity. A boxing ring is raised in the center. The
text: only lights in the area directly over it. With the
text: twelve witnesses in the lead, the party makes its way
text: through a path in the crowd. An OLD WOMAN with a fly
text: switch, not unlike Inkosikazi's, speaks from the ring.
text: As PK passes the whispers start.
speaker_heading: WHISPERS
dialog: Onoshobishobi.
dialog: 80.
text: The Woman in the ring begins to chant. The crowd picks
dialog: it up.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Onoshobishopi Ingelosi.
dialog: Shobi shobi Ingelosi.
text: PK looks back at Maria who is a bit unnerved, as are
text: Morrie and Solly. He looks across at Mandoma whose face
text: is a mask looking straight ahead, betraying nothing. The
text: two men climb into the ring and stand in their corners.
text: The Old Woman shuffles over and peers into PK's face.
text: She mutters something inaudible, then turns to the crowd.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.
text: The crowd picks up the chant. She waves and the crowd
text: goes silent. Somewhere in the darkness a single voice
text: begins to sing "Nkosi Sikelel I Afrika" -- the African
dialog: national anthem.
text: The crowd picks it up. PK looks down to the front row
text: where Nguni sits courteously attending to Maria in a seat
text: of honor among the twelve men in suits.
text: The African national anthem finishes. The BELL RINGS
text: three times. The Old Woman is led from the ring. An
text: Indian Referee in all white enters the ring and waves
text: the two fighters forward.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: You are listening to me please.
dialog: When I am shouting break, you must
text: break at once. When a knockdown
dialog: is coming, it is for an eight
dialog: count. No heads, no elbows. You
dialog: fight clean or by golly I am
dialog: giving you penalty points. Good
dialog: luck, boys.
text: PK and Mandoma touch gloves and go to their respective
dialog: corners.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: What do you see?
text: Solly watches Mandoma dancing across the ring.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
text: A very tough fight.
text: The BELL RINGS.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: Watch the left hook.
text: Mandoma comes charging across the ring and begins to fire
text: everything in his arsenal at PK, overwhelming him. PK
text: cannot get away from him and takes a series of devastat-
text: ing combinations which end in a left hook to PK's jaw.
text: PK drops like lead. The Referee starts counting. PK
text: shakes his head clear and rises at eight. The Referee
text: checks his gloves. There is a cut under his right eye.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Continue.
text: Again, Mandoma comes charging hard. PK defends himself
text: as best he can, trying to counter. But Mandoma's offense
text: won't allow it. He beats on PK until the round ends. PK
text: sits down in his corner. Morrie works on his eye.
speaker_heading: PK
text: God, he hits like a truck.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
text: He's going for the quick knockout.
text: He can't keep it up. Soon the
text: truck runs out of gas.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: If he catches me again like that
dialog: I'll run out of gas --
dialog: permanently.
text: The BELL SOUNDS. PK is hardly off his stool when Mandoma
text: is on him, pummeling him. PK backpedals, bobs and
text: weaves. Mandoma's punches come fast and furious, each
text: one looking to end the fight. Mandoma gets PK against
text: the ropes and bangs away. PK covers up. Mandoma
text: punishes his arms and kidneys. PK swings back and es-
text: capes. Mandoma pursues him. He catches PK with a body
text: chop and then a chopping left. PK goes down again. The
text: Referee starts to count. The crowd is completely silent.
text: The BELL RINGS. PK returns to his corner, shaking his
text: head, trying to clear it. He flops onto his stool.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: He's had it. He's got no strength
text: in his punch.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Could've fooled me.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: I'm telling you.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: 82.
dialog: Tell him.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: Look -- he's taking water.
text: They all look.
speaker_heading: 105 THEIR POV 105
text: of Mandoma, breathing heavily, sweating profusely, drinks
text: deeply from his water flask.
scene_heading: 106 BACK TO SCENE 106
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: See. Where that water goes --
dialog: you go. Right to here.
text: He pokes PK's belly.
speaker_heading: SOLLY
dialog: You put your punches there, you
dialog: win. You don't, you lose.
text: The BELL RINGS. Mandoma comes charging out. PK goes on
text: defense. He hits Mandoma hard to the head. Mandoma
text: whips around and hits him hard. PK spins and hits the
text: canvas. His vision blurs, doubles. The SOUND of a
text: WATERFALL fills his head.
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
speaker_heading: 107 PK 107
text: struggling to climb the rocks in the pool below the
text: waterfall. He is halfway across this time.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Three... four... five...
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
speaker_heading: 109 PK 109

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: 110 REFEREE 110
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: ... seven... eight... nine...
text: PK rises. The crowd goes wild. The Referee holds up six
dialog: fingers.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: How many fingers?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Six.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: PK
text: In a fight behind on points.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Okay. Continue.
text: Mandoma rushes in for the kill. PK feints and comes up
text: under one of Mandoma's punches, burying a body shot into
text: his gut. Mandoma grunts and backs up. PK pursues him.
text: Mandoma tries to recover. He throws another big punch.
text: PK ducks under it and puts two more hooks into Mandoma's
text: stomach. Mandoma starts to back up for the first time
text: in the fight. PK boxes, jabbing, feinting, pushing Man-
text: doma around the ring, taking control. Mandoma, heading
text: for exhaustion, throws another big punch in desperation.
text: PK hits him with three punches in return. Mandoma swings
text: again with a last desperate effort, and PK buries the
text: Solly Goldman thirteen into every part of his body. PK
text: steps back and with his last punch, puts Mandoma down.
text: The crowd goes silent. The Referee counts Mandoma out.
text: He raises PK's hand. Still, the crowd is silent.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: We're in the shit now. Nice
dialog: knowing you, Solly.
text: He and Solly look around at the somber black faces flick-
text: ering in the shadows of the ring light. PK looks down at
text: Mandoma in silence. Mandoma rises unsteadily. He stands
text: in front of PK, staring into his eyes, and then he raises
text: PK's arm above his head.
speaker_heading: MANDOMA
dialog: Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.
text: The crowd goes wild, chanting, singing over and over as

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: PK

text: Maria touches his face. Her eyes soften.
speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: MARIA

speaker_heading: MORRIE

speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: Best time for walking.
speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: MORRIE

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: ST. JOHN

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: MANDOMA
dialog: Second greatest in this room.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: But you didn't come to talk about
dialog: fighting.
text: Mandoma shakes his head. He waits for a moment, then
text: begins.
speaker_heading: MANDOMA
dialog: When you say to me, Onoshobishobi
dialog: Ingelosi means nothing, you are
dialog: right. And you are wrong. The
dialog: legend gives the people hope for
dialog: a good tomorrow. But hope alone
dialog: will not make a good tomorrow
dialog: for the people. You cannot
dialog: write our letters, get us clothes,
dialog: food, work. These things we must
dialog: do ourselves, so we can be part
dialog: of this country's good tomorrow.
dialog: If we are not, the hope will
dialog: disappear. The people will grow
text: tired. The tired will grow angry
dialog: and there will be no good tomorrow
dialog: for anybody -- black or white.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: What are you asking from me?
speaker_heading: MANDOMA
dialog: To be part of something you must
dialog: know what everyone else knows.
dialog: We have our own knowledge. We
dialog: need yours.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: We get our knowledge in schools,
dialog: Gideon. We're not born with it.
speaker_heading: MANDOMA
dialog: Then it must be the same with us.
speaker_heading: MORRIE
dialog: You have schools.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: MANDOMA
dialog: Yes. And teachers who cannot do

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: You are asking me to put the

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: The reputation of this school,

speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: I'm aware of that. I'm also aware
dialog: of what will happen if this ever
dialog: gets out. We live in a country

speaker_heading: ST. JOHN
dialog: All right. I will allow it on a

text: Maria and PK are about to race. Maria is given a head
text: start of ten yards.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Ready. Set. Go!
text: They both take off. Maria runs as hard as she can. PK
text: catches up to her. She strains with the effort. PK
text: crosses the finish line first. Maria trips and falls,
text: rolling in the sand. PK comes back to her. He kneels
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You're supposed to let me win.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Then you'd say I was being
text: condescending.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You were guilty of that when you
dialog: gave me a head start.
dialog: 90.
text: She kisses him and stands up. They begin to walk along

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Get your formal yet?
text: PK grows uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Uh... no.
speaker_heading: MARIA
text: The dance is only a week away.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Maria...

dialog: I can't come to the dance.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I have an obligation.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Can't you change it?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: It's a permanent obligation.

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: You're breaking up with me.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Then what could be so important
dialog: that it takes all your Saturday
dialog: nights?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I really can't say.
text: Maria starts to cry. She throws her arm around him.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: 91.
dialog: P.K., I love you. Please don't
dialog: go away.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I'm not going away.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Yes you are. I can feel it.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I'm not. I'm just tutoring.
text: Maria pulls back.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I started a school...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ... for Gideon Mandoma and some

text: Maria's sadness turns to anger.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I'm losing you to a bunch of
dialog: kaffirs?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You're not losing anything.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: No? Are you escorting me to the
dialog: dance? Are you going to see me on
dialog: the only free night they give us?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Maria, this is important to me.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: And my life's important to me.

scene_heading: 118 EXT. CLIFF FACE 118
text: On an escarpment high above the dense green rainforest

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (breathing hard)
dialog: Ach. You see how beautiful?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You ever hear of glycerine, Doc?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Mr. Going-To-Oxford-Smarty-Pants.
dialog: Of course I know about glycerine.
dialog: Triglycerine. Biglycerine.
dialog: Monoglycerine. What do you want
dialog: to know?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Why you don't use it. It's only
text: a little pill under the tongue.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Tongues were not made to put
dialog: little pills under. When I have
dialog: to start with that, I become
dialog: something else.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Well, until you become something
dialog: else, the little pills would make
dialog: this easier on your heart.
text: A CLAP of THUNDER cuts into their conversation. Thick
text: roiling rain clouds appear suddenly.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Little pills or no little pills
dialog: -- we don't find cover, we both
text: turn into something else.
text: Lightning splits the sky. Rain begins to fall, pelting
text: the escarpment.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Look for a cave. Always in this
text: kind of rock there is caves.
dialog: Quick! Quick!
text: PK starts to move horizontally across the cliff face like
text: a spider on a wall. Doc follows. The rain becomes
text: torrential.
text: PK turns to look back at Doc.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Don't look at me. Go!
dialog: 93.
text: PK forges ahead.
scene_heading: 119 HIS POV - OPENING 119
text: some 20 yards ahead.
scene_heading: 120 BACK TO SCENE 120
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I've found something.
text: The rain is so heavy PK can barely make out Doc behind
text: him. When he can, he sees the old man pause, breathing
text: hard. PK makes his way back to Doc. Halfway there,
text: Doc waves him forward and starts to move. PK reaches
text: the small opening and slips in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 121 INT. SMALL CAVE 121
text: PK stoops in the small cave, dripping wet. A moment
text: later Doc's foot appears at the entrance. PK helps him
text: in. Doc slumps down, exhausted.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You okay?
text: Breathing too hard to reply, Doc shakes his head in the
text: affirmative. PK looks out at the rain forming a sheer
text: wall of water outside. He turns to Doc, who is getting
text: up, flashlight in hand.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DOC
text: Exploring.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Why don't you just rest?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Plenty time for resting when I am
dialog: something else. Look.
text: He strikes a match. A wind from inside the cave blows
text: it side to side.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: When does a cave have wind? This
dialog: 94.
dialog: is more than some little cave, my
dialog: friend.
text: Doc crouches down and follows the beam of his flashlight
text: to the rear of the cave where there is a small opening.
text: He shines the light into it.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Here. See? There is a passage.
text: Before PK can say anything else, Doc has wriggled through
text: the small opening.
text: PK, a bit peeved, takes his own flashlight and follows.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 122 INT. SMALL TUNNEL 122
text: PK crawls after Doc, making his way through the small
text: tunnel on his stomach.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You know the pyramids are nothing
text: more than man's attempt to recreate
dialog: the first safe home our species
dialog: had -- the cave. It is the
dialog: ultimate safe resting place. The
dialog: first place man could lay down
dialog: and have a good night's sleep
dialog: without worrying about waking up
dialog: as something's supper.
text: Doc stops crawling. So does PK. A DRIPPING can be
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You hear that? There is something
dialog: waiting for us.
text: Doc starts moving quicker.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Let's hope it's not hungry.
text: Doc squeezes out of the small space. PK joins him in a
text: slightly larger tunnel, the same size as the first one
dialog: -- stoop height.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Better, ja?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: What's that smell?
dialog: 95.
text: All of a sudden there is a RUSTLING noise.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: What's that?
text: Doc recognizes the sound. He pounces on PK, knocking
text: him to the floor and covering him with his body. Not
text: a moment too soon. For a thousand bats fill the tunnel
text: flying through.
scene_heading: 123 PK'S POV - BATS 123
text: flying wildly through the flashlight beams.
text: In a blur, the bats are gone, disappeared into another
text: tunnel entrance to the left.
scene_heading: 124 BACK TO SCENE 124
text: Doc an PK rise slowly. The silence of the cave is
text: punctuated by the DRIPPING.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Maybe it's stopped raining.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Who can think about rain when you
text: are on the edge of the great
text: unknown cave.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You don't know that.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: The bats didn't come from a
dialog: shoebox, Mr. Know-It-All.
text: Doc heads off.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Sometimes I think maybe sending
dialog: you off to that fancy-shmancy
dialog: school was not such a good idea.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: It was your idea. Your'e the
dialog: one who pushed for me to go.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Ja. But who knew they do such a
dialog: good job of boxing up part of
dialog: 96.
dialog: your brain.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Which part is that?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: The one where is all the
text: questions. The curiosity center.
dialog: Look.
text: Ahead in the tunnel is a luminous glow, filling an
dialog: entrance.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Did I tell you?
text: Doc and PK hurry on.
scene_heading: 125 THEIR POV - TUNNEL OPENING 125
text: As they come to a tunnel opening: a large cave, perhaps
text: 200 feet wide by 100 feet high, filled with stalactites
text: and stalagmites composed of pure, crystallized calcium
dialog: carbonate.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Wunderbar.
text: The whole chamber glistens with an eerie phosphorescence.
text: Toward one end of the crystallized room eight stalagmites
text: grown up from the floor cement to form a huge crystal
text: slab some ten feet off the floor. A buttress of stalg-
text: mites drip off it forming a natural, if uneven, stairway.
scene_heading: 126 BACK TO SCENE 126
text: Doc and PK stare at the crystal cave in amazement.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: How many hundreds of thousands of
dialog: years to make this masterpiece?
dialog: Everything outside can change,
dialog: P.K. This remains the same. We
dialog: are in the heart of Africa, P.K.
dialog: The heart of Africa.
text: Doc, in his own world of wonderment, wanders down into
text: the cave among the stalactites. PK follows, soon losing
text: sight of Doc behind the large crystal columns.
speaker_heading: DOC (O.S.)
dialog: You know, if a person stayed here
dialog: for 100,000 years what would be
dialog: 97.
dialog: left? Crystal. Like a crystal
dialog: mummy. Incredible, ja?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Incredible.
text: Doc's preoccupation with death irks him. He studies a
text: piece of crystal.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I wish we had brought the camera.
dialog: Think there's enough light to
dialog: shoot?
text: Doc does not answer.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Doc?
text: His concern rises. He moves through the maze of crystal,
text: his pace quickening.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Doc?
text: Still no answer.
text: His vision obscured, PK reaches the elevated slab. He
text: clambers up the buttress for a better view. When he
text: reaches the top he stops cold.
speaker_heading: 127 HIS POV - DOC 127
text: lying on the crystal slab, eyes closed, hands folded on
text: his chest.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: This is not funny.
text: Doc opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: This is incredible! The crystal.
dialog: You can feel the life go right
dialog: through you. Here.
text: Doc rises.
speaker_heading: DOC

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: (short)
dialog: No. That's all right. Can we go?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: We have only just gotten here.
dialog: What's the matter, P.K.?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: All day long you've been talking
dialog: about becoming something else,
dialog: about dying. You never talked
dialog: about dying before.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I'm 87 next month. It's natural.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Not to a sixteen-year-old it's
dialog: not. It's painful.
text: Doc realizes what PK is saying.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You are right. I am sorry.
dialog: Sixteen-year-old ears should only
dialog: hear life.
text: Doc starts to whistle "The Marriage of Figaro" by Mozart.
text: The RESONANCE of the WHISTLING off the crystal sounds
text: beautiful, exotic. Doc beckons PK to join in with him.
text: PK does so, hesitantly. Then pleased with the sound and
text: the feeling, more fully.
text: Doc and PK exit through the stalactites, whistling.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 129 INT. DOC'S HOUSE - NIGHT 129

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I'll just set you up with some
dialog: coffee here, so in the morning you
dialog: won't have to bother making it.
text: He begins to prepare the coffee.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I didn't mean to tell you what
dialog: 99.
dialog: you can and can't talk about back
dialog: in the cave today. I guess I
dialog: just don't like to think of you
dialog: being...
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: PK (CONT'D)

text: There is no reply.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Doc?
text: PK turns to Doc, dead asleep, still sitting up. PK goes
text: over and gently lays the old man down. He removes his
text: boots and throws a blanket over him. PK blows out the
text: kerosene lamp and goes to exit. He is about to hang
text: their two rucksacks on two hooks by the door when Doc's
text: voice turns him.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: P.K.?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I'm here, Doc.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: The crystal cave will be our

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: DOC

speaker_heading: BRETYN
dialog: Get up, you bloody commie Jew!

speaker_heading: BRETYN
dialog: Captain.
text: The two police lines start to move towards each other,

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: No. Wait. We'll leave.
speaker_heading: BRETYN
dialog: Too late. You never should have

speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: PK!
text: PK turns off-balance. Maria leaps. The club cuts

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Maria!
text: PK drops to the fallen girl's side. He is frantic at

text: her open blank eyes. The battle raging around him
text: recedes before his pain and rising rage. All at once
text: he explodes, screaming like a madman.
text: He leaps at Bretyn and bangs one punch after another
text: into the startled man. Bretyn's face is broken over and
text: over against PK's fists. Still PK keeps pounding blow

text: Three cops descend on PK and beat him mercilessly

speaker_heading: DOC (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PK
dialog: For what reason?
speaker_heading: SOLLY

speaker_heading: PK

dialog: flowing, and since when the ore
dialog: doesn't flow, neither does the
dialog: money, working the grizzly is a
dialog: very crucial and therefore very
dialog: well-paid position. Three months'
dialog: 128.
dialog: work earns a year's stay at

scene_heading: 181 INT. MINER'S BAR 181
text: A crude place where the bar runs the back length of the
text: room and the bare concrete surroundings offer nothing in
dialog: the way of diversion from the main purpose of being there
dialog: -- to drink hard and long.
text: THOMAS, a harsh, ruddy-faced Welshman, the School of

text: up at PK.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Are you crazy? To sign on for
dialog: a year?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You said I was the best you ever
dialog: taught, sir.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: And you are, boyo. The absolute
dialog: best.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: But even the best doesn't survive
dialog: a year on the bars. Down in that
dialog: damn tube the luck runs out sooner
dialog: than later. You may be a genius
dialog: at reading the rock but you ain't
dialog: no fuckin' fortune teller.
text: Thomas throws back another drink.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You worked grizzly a year.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: And let me show you what I have
dialog: to show for it to this day.
text: He holds up his hand. It shakes noticeably.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: And that's thirteen years after
dialog: the fact, boyo.
dialog: 129.
text: A NOISE from the doorway turns Thomas's attention. He
text: looks over as four huge men enter, drillers, men whose
text: faces and bodies are as hard and massive as the rock
dialog: they work.
text: One of the men pauses at the door and grabs his head as
text: an enormous jolt of pain runs through it. He shakes it
text: off and follows his friends to a table.
text: Thomas looks concerned.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Something wrong?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: (unconvincing)
dialog: Nothing.
text: The BARTENDER comes over and puts another shot in front
dialog: of Thomas.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: One double brandy. One...
dialog: (derisive)
dialog: lemon soda.
text: He puts the lemon soda in front of PK.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Come on, then.
text: Thomas lifts his glass.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: On being the best damned blaster
dialog: ever taught by Ian Thomas.
dialog: Cheers.
text: Thomas and PK clink glasses. Thomas knocks his shot back.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Another.
text: The bartender pours another.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Sure you don't want one?
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I don't like the taste.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Taste? You don't drink for the
dialog: taste.
dialog: 130.
text: He holds out his hand. It is steady now. He fixes PK
text: with a portentous stare. Thomas looks over at the table
text: of drillers. The man with the headache is downing one
text: shot after another.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Hell's comin'.
text: He draws PK's attention to the drillers.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Drillers. He's got a powder
dialog: pain from breathin' too much of
dialog: that damn gelignite. The pain's
dialog: bad enough. Mixed with a little
dialog: alcohol it's fuckin' lethal.
text: He watches the driller down two more shots of liquor.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Come on. We ain't got much time.
text: Thomas directs PK towards the door.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: The two most dangerous things
dialog: you'll ever see in your life,
text: boyo: a hangup of rock that
dialog: won't blast free on first shot
text: and a driller with a powder
dialog: headache drinkin'.
text: As they reach the door the behemoth explodes with a
text: roar. He grabs his head and staggers backwards; a mad
text: look comes into his eyes.
text: His three huge frineds rush to grab him. He throws
text: them off as if they were ants.
text: He rips a table out of its bolting to the concrete
text: floor and flings it across the room.
text: The men drinking in the bar, all tough cases, begin to
dialog: flee.
text: Thomas grabs PK whose eyes stare in amazement as the

text: Off a play a fight breaks out. One of the men is kicked

speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Morrie. To answer your

dialog: here, but only in the loosest
dialog: sense of the words "sport" and
dialog: "play". The rules are
dialog: different for everything, in
dialog: games as well as in the rest of
dialog: our lives. The managers, the

text: They live apart from the miners.
dialog: They have families. Proper

dialog: in the loosest sense of the word.
dialog: The laws of survival are simple--
dialog: you either do or you don't.
text: PK comes down a side street. A half a dozen men at
text: cards, hard-faced desperadoes, see him pass, eyeing him
text: closely. PK averts his eyes. From behind his back
text: comes the sound of LIPS PUCKERING loudly, indecently.
text: PK swallows hard. The sound of a CHARGE turns him to
text: the six men bolting from their card game after him,
text: whooping with lascivious intent. PK takes off.
text: The chase takes PK and his pursuers flying through the
text: streets of the camp, past one identical cement hut after
text: another. People watch, disinterested. No one raises
text: a hand to help.
text: PK comes racing around the corner to three of the men
dialog: 132.
text: blocking the street in front of him. He whirls. The
text: others catch up behind, yelling and hooting. The two
text: lines advance.
text: PK gets ready. When the first man is close enough he
text: hits him hard, breaking his jaw. He swings at another,
text: catching him flush in the face. But then the rest are
text: upon him. Even though PK fights like hell, he is
text: overwhelmed. The blows come from everywhere, beating
text: him to the ground. His arms and legs are firmly grabbed
text: by four men. He is banged hard face down onto a concrete
text: table. The fifth man pulls down his pants and the sixth
text: begins to undo his own fly. All the men scream obsceni-
text: ties, anticipating the rape.
text: PK struggles like hell to no avail. As he is about to
text: be violated, a roaring giant of a man tears into the
text: pack like a bear shredding dogs. He scatters the men,
text: knocking some unconscious, sending the rest to flight.
text: He stands over PK, a looming block of granite with a
text: wild black beard and coal-black eyes. His intent only
text: becomes clear as to whether he is claiming a prize or
text: helping a friend when he offers PK his hand, lifting PK
text: effortlessly.
text: He examines PK's bruised face with some concern and
text: then smiles.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: You know, Rasputin, I had them

speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)
dialog: The only way to unblock it is to

dialog: the only way to do that is to set
dialog: the charge in mud, which means

dialog: with the devil.
text: PK reaches the hangup. He works at taking a prepared

speaker_heading: PK

speaker_heading: JOCKO

dialog: That even the other drillers
text: leave the bar when the man drinks,
dialog: so crazed does he get. All right.
dialog: He tried to kill you. But he
dialog: didn't. You're alive is all that
dialog: matters. Do us all a favor, boyo.
dialog: Get out of here. Get on a train
dialog: and don't come back. We've no
dialog: liking to be burying someone we're

text: Rasputin takes him around in a huge bear hug, smothering
text: him. Pk survives, a bit rumpled. He smiles at Rasputin

speaker_heading: RASPUTIN
scene_heading: PK. Botha. Nyet. Nyet. PK.
text: PK turns the corner and is gone.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 214 EXT. MINING TOWN 214
text: PK walks through the huts of the drillers, massive to
text: a man. Most of them are coming off shift. Some of
text: them rub their temples, trying to soothe the pain of
dialog: the powder.
text: PK comes to one hut. He knocks. No answer. He knocks
dialog: again.
text: A DRILLER comes by.
speaker_heading: DRILLER
dialog: Who you lookin' for?
speaker_heading: PK

dialog: number five.
speaker_heading: DRILLER

dialog: night, but it is the rule.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
text: Ja. In one hour it is pffft.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 216 INT. BAR 216
text: In the murky light one hulking figure sits at the bar,
text: drinking shot after shot of whiskey.
text: PK enters and walks across the room to the massive
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Are you Botha?
text: Botha does not turn around.
speaker_heading: BOTHA
dialog: Ja.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: I'm PK. I worked your grizzly.
speaker_heading: BOTHA
dialog: Ja.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Why'd you try to kill me?
text: Botha turns slowly to reveal his face, swollen with
text: anger and drink. He tears the short sleeve off his
text: left arm, revealing a crudely tattooed swastika.
speaker_heading: BOTHA
dialog: Because I missed the first time,
dialog: rooinek.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Jaapie Botha.
dialog: 149.
text: Botha rises drunkenly. PK backs up.
speaker_heading: BOTHA
dialog: You remember, rooinek.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Botha. It was thirteen years ago.
speaker_heading: BOTHA
dialog: Because of you they expelled me.
dialog: Because of you my father beat me.
dialog: Threw me out from the farm.
dialog: Because of you.
text: He throws back another drink and rushes PK with a roar.
text: PK sidesteps and heads for the door.
text: Botha gets there first and bolts it.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Botha. We've made a lot of money
dialog: working together. Let the past be
dialog: the past.
speaker_heading: BOTHA
dialog: You ruined the country, all you
dialog: rooineks. You come and ruin the
dialog: country.
text: He rushes PK again. Again PK sidesteps.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: No, Jaapie Botha. It's hate
dialog: ruining the country.
speaker_heading: BOTHA
dialog: Jaah.
text: He swings at PK. PK ducks.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Boer hate.
speaker_heading: BOTHA
dialog: Our country.
text: At that moment the powder headache strikes. Botha
text: bellows, grabbing his head staggering backward.
text: PK runs for the door. As he reaches it a table slams
text: against it, thrown halfway across the room by a
text: powder-mad Botha.
dialog: 150.
text: PK jumps out of the way at the last minute.
text: Men's faces begin to appear at the iron-meshed windows.
text: People start to bang at the door.
text: PK, realizing there is no talking to Botha now, does
text: his best to stay out of the charging giant's way.
text: Botha charges him. PK sidesteps and hits him with a
text: left hook. The punch has no effect. Botha swings out
text: wildly. PK easily dances away. Botha picks up
text: another table and heaves it at PK. PK jumps to avoid
text: it, but trips on an overturned stool. He goes down.
text: The miners outside, crowding three deep, yell and shout.
text: People start to make bets.
text: Botha charges PK as PK scrambles up. Botha swings. The
text: blow glances off PK's shoulder and sends him flying,
text: spinning over a table. Botha leaps at PK, driving him
text: into the wall. PK grimaces, sagging. Botha picks him
text: up and starts to squeeze him to death in his massive
text: arms. PK, his hands free, starts to pound on Botha's
text: ears with his palms. Botha screams as the powder head-
text: ache accelerates through the top of his skull. He
text: drops PK. PK rolls away and swings a stool at Botha's
text: midsection. Botha is driven back. PK goes to swing
text: the stool again. Botha catches it as if it were made
text: of balsa. He rips it out of PK's hand and flings it
text: back at him, charging behind it.
text: PK goes topping end over end. Botha gets a hand on him
text: and lifts him from behind. He flings PK over the bar.
text: PK hits the floor, stunned. Botha pulls at the bar
text: trying to get at PK.
text: He rocks the bar and rocks the bar as PK is trying to
text: regain his bearings. Finally, with one tremendous rip,
text: the bar comes away from its bolting. Botha pulls it
dialog: aside.
text: PK rises just as Botha moves in. PK hits him three
text: solid shots to the stomach but Botha hardly feels
text: them. He grabs PK and starts to squeeze him again.
text: Face to face, Botha's crazed eyes watch the life
text: fade from PK's.

speaker_heading: VOICE #1 (V.O.)
text: He's dead. He's dead.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 222 PK 222
text: as he swims to the last stone. He reaches it and
text: struggles on top. He stands on the stone, trimphant.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 223 BOTHA 223
text: squeezing again, bellowing.
text: PK opens his eyes, draws his head back, and butts
text: Botha in the face. Botha's nose shatters. The grip
text: slackens a bit. PK hits him in the face again. Botha
text: drops PK to the floor as he screams at the unbelievable
text: pain. Blood pours from his nose.
speaker_heading: 224 PK 224
text: catches his breath and is on Botha. He throws three
text: hard punches to his face. Enraged, Botha howls and
text: swings at PK. PK goes underneath his arm and hooks
text: three times into the ribs. Botha grunts, hurt. He
text: swings again with the other hand.
dialog: 152.

scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 226 PK 226
text: pounds into Botha's ribs under another wild swinging
text: punch by the giant. Botha shouts and keeps advancing,
text: swinging. PK backs up, peppering him, leading him
text: forward. Left-right. He punishes Botha for each punch
text: the big man throws, but always backing up. Botha, half
text: blind, spitting blood follows.
text: The crowd screams for him to move side to side. The
text: betting changes fast and furious.
text: PK glances over his shoulder to the cement wall behind
text: him. He takes two more steps and then fires two jabs
text: at Botha's face and then stands stock still. Wild with
text: anger, Botha throws a huge right hand to PK's head.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 227 CLUB 227
text: coming down on Maria's head.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 228 PK 228
text: At the last moment PK sidesteps. Botha's hand smashes
text: into the cement wall. His hand shatters into a hundred
text: pieces. The pain is so immense he is rendered helpless.
text: PK doesn't waste a second. He starts banging away at
text: Botha with hard, fast combinations.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Want to see the wages of hate?
text: Botha feels the punches. He steps back, faltering.
text: PK pursues him.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: Here. Here is what hate gets you.
text: PK hammers away, punching with each word, harder and
dialog: faster.
dialog: 153.

dialog: For Doc. For Mandoma. For Maria.
text: Botha is out on his feet.
speaker_heading: PK
dialog: For Africa.
text: PK unleashes a final pjnch -- the hardest one he ever
text: threw. It catches Botha square in the jaw. Botha
text: goes over onto his back like a tree falling.
text: The crowd outside screams and yells with delight. Money
text: changes hands.
text: PK collects himself and steps over Botha. He unbolts
text: the door and steps outside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 229 EXT. BAR 229
text: The crowd goes silent as PK emerges. The crowd parts.

speaker_heading: PK (V.O.)
dialog: I knew as I walked out of the
dialog: mines, out of Africa, that I
dialog: wasn't fleeing. That one day
dialog: I would return. Inkosi
dialog: Inkosikasi was right. I was a
dialog: man for all Africa. Bound to
dialog: her by my spirit. Bound by my
dialog: dreams. And Africa had taught
dialog: me the lesson I would take out
dialog: into the world and one day bring
dialog: back. Great changes can come from
dialog: the power of many. But only when
dialog: the many join together and create
dialog: what is invincible. The Power of
dialog: One.
text: ZOOM OUT as PK continues walking out of the camp and
