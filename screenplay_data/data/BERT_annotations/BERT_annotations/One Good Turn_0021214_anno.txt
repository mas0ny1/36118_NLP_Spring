speaker_heading: SAUL

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: All right, all right. Let's have the

speaker_heading: SAUL

dialog: Cute, ain't it? It's no "but," Ruthie --

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Well, because what -- ?
speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: They don't want Eddie?
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: They don't want Eddie -- that's the truth,

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: SAUL

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Well, if they don't want Eddie Farrell,

speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Never mind the display of temperature!
dialog: But, listen, it's for your own good!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Ruth, it ain't us, it's the office. They

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You don't understand. I couldn't break
dialog: with Eddie.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh, I got it. Love certainly makes the

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh, I know Eddie's no wonder but he's

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Sure, he'll develop lockjaw the way he

text: The agents walk off in disgust. Ruth rises and confronts Saul
text: while Jim takes a seat.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Please, Saul, listen. I can talk to you
dialog: as a friend. Let us lay off a couple of
dialog: months. I'm working with Eddie. I'll give
dialog: him poise and polish and I'll show him
dialog: how to wear clothes.
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Say, what's going on here?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Aw, he has the makings. I'll teach him
dialog: how to sell a song and all you have to do
dialog: is to book us into the Strand and have
text: the office catch the act.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah, I know. And in Newark, you'll want
dialog: us to look at you in Trenton.
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Yeah, and in Trenton, you'll want us to go
dialog: to Poughkeepsie. And in my condition --!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Say, Saul, with your drag up in that
dialog: office, you won't have any trouble stalling
dialog: them off a few months. Tell 'em -- aw, tell
dialog: ‘em my health's bad. Tell them anything.
dialog: (voice breaking)
dialog: I don't care anything about the money. I

dialog: do it.
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: A few months?!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: A few months. What's the difference?
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Say, it's a big difference between you and
dialog: Eddie. You're marvelous. And he's, uh, er

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Don't need you? Why, I wouldn't go on

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Can you beat it? Six months ago that guy
dialog: was a bust!
speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: SAUL

speaker_heading: SAUL

speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Pre-zactly!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, what'll I do with her?
speaker_heading: SAUL

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, she's got to live.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh, don't worry. Ruth can play the small
dialog: time just as long as she likes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (almost persuaded)
dialog: Well, I guess that could be arranged.
speaker_heading: SAUL
dialog: Say, why should you worry? You've got your

text: Ruth's roommate MARGE enters, carrying packages.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Hello, Ruth.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (tries to get a grip)
dialog: Hello, Marge.
text: Marge puts the packages in the kitchen and returns to the living
text: to discard her purse, hat and coat. Marge is a low-paid, wise-

speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Well, here I am -- all tired out. I've
dialog: been from five-and-ten cent store to

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Gee, I wish I had your disposition. What

speaker_heading: MARGE
text: (pulls out a card table)
dialog: Rations, dearie, rations. It looks like a

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Fix something for yourself. I'm not

speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh, I've brought some swell corned beef.

dialog: Aw, Eddie was all right until success went

speaker_heading: MARGE

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Somehow I - I just can't work without him.

speaker_heading: MARGE

dialog: the chinaware, will ya?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (faint grin, head down)
dialog: Aw, I'll get over it, I guess.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Sure. Love 'em, tease 'em, and give 'em
dialog: the ozone.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: That's all right when you're playing with
dialog: numbers. But when you've just got one
dialog: who's ... been everything to you.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Say, you sound like a page out of "True
dialog: Confessions"!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Well, I feel worse. And think how hard I
dialog: worked with him. That's gratitude.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yeah, when you first knew him, he couldn't
text: carry a tune if it had a handle.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: And this is the thanks I get for it.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh, you'll get over it. I've had more
dialog: knocks in this racket than a crosstown
dialog: bus. And I been in this game since the
text: Big Dipper was just a drinking cup.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (chuckles)
text: It's the woman who pays.
text: Marge brings a coffee pot to the table and sits.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Well, why don't you stop paying and do
dialog: some playing? Say, you know, you've passed
dialog: up more offers this week -- and for what?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Well, I just can't get him out of my mind.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh, that ungrateful double-crosser... Say
dialog: do you know if you were drowning, he'd
dialog: turn a hose on you.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Well, I'm not drowning yet.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yeah. With those eyes and that shape,
dialog: you'll always be able to stand up.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Maybe it would be better if I tried to
dialog: forget him.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Better? You're speaking mildly.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Will you help me?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Will I help you? Can Lindbergh fly?
text: Marge forks some corned beef onto a plate for Ruth.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Come on, eat some of this.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Mmmm. It does smell good.
text: Ruth moves closer to the table, puts a napkin in her lap,
dialog: her tea, etc.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Listen, after you've huddled up with this
dialog: corned beef, you'll have a better outlook
dialog: on life. And after we finish, we'll put on
text: some powder and go gunning for big game.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I believe you will help me to forget him
