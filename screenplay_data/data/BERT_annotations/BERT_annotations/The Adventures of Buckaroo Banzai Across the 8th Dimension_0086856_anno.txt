speaker_heading: BUCKAROO BANZAI
dialog: Did you say..."Peggy"?
speaker_heading: PENNY PRIDDY
dialog: My name is Penny. Penny Priddy. There I've said it, but it won't mean

dialog: The business of the names settled, Buckaroo and the Cavaliers breathing
dialog: a bit more easily...
speaker_heading: BUCKAROO BANZAI
dialog: Nobody's a nobody. Why're you crying? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: PENNY PRIDDY

dialog: 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my

scene_heading: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
dialog: Thank you for coming. Before I answer any questions, I think Buckaroo
dialog: owes us all a few explanations for yesterday's antics.
speaker_heading: BUCKAROO BANZAI
dialog: Mr. Secretary...Senator Cunningham, ladies and gentlemen...thirty years
dialog: ago, nearly to this day, my mother and father and Sir Alan Motley, all
dialog: former colleagues of Professor Toichi Hikita at the Texas School of
dialog: Mines, gave their lives for what was considered at the time an insane
dialog: notion: the possibility of contacting alien life... not on another
text: planet, but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid
dialog: matter...life which, before the war, Professor Hikita had actually
text: glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with
dialog: Doctor Emilio Lizardo.

speaker_heading: BUCKAROO BANZAI
dialog: I don't wanna go get too technical here, ladies and gentlemen, but I'm
dialog: talking twister physics. Quantum Mechanics. Now you see, now you
dialog: don't. This table I'm sitting behind? It appears to be solid matter,
dialog: right?
text: Buckaroo demonstrating by picking up his plastic water glass, dropping
text: it, splashing water left and right as the container naturally bounces
dialog: off the table...
speaker_heading: BUCKAROO BANZAI
dialog: But in point of fact, the solid parts of this table... the protons,
dialog: quarks, your neutrons and electrons...they comprise only about one
dialog: quadrillionth of its total volume.
scene_heading: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
dialog: Which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into.
speaker_heading: BUCKAROO BANZAI
dialog: Exactly. So the professor here, way back in 1937, figured that if
dialog: solid matter is mostly empty space, a person oughta be able to discover
dialog: a to travel inside things like tables. And mountains.
speaker_heading: PROF. HIKITA
dialog: We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating
text: gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its
dialog: electroweak forces!
speaker_heading: BUCKAROO BANZAI
dialog: Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right,
dialog: professor?

speaker_heading: BUCKAROO BANZAI

speaker_heading: RADAR SHIELD ONE
