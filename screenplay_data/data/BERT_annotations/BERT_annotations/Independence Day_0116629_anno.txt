text: leaving. Word is a space ship is
dialog: heading this way.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: We should leave too.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: There's a group heading south,
dialog: they said there's a hospital just
dialog: a couple hours away. I think we
dialog: should follow them.
text: Russell nods in agreement. A knock on the door. Alicia turns
text: to find a handsome young boy, PHILIP in the doorway holding a
text: bottle of pills.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Penicillin. At least it will help
dialog: keep his fever down.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: It's really nice of you to help
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: I wish I could do more but we're
dialog: moving out.
speaker_heading: ALICIA
dialog: (too eager)
dialog: We're going with you. I mean,
dialog: we're going too.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Cool.
text: Alicia nods, smitten. Philip smiles charmingly and leaves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME
text: Back in the passenger section, the President sits with General
text: Grey and Chief of Staff Nimziki. The Technician from the
text: command module is briefing them.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: They must be targeting our
dialog: satellites. We've lost all
dialog: satellite communication, tracking
dialog: and mapping.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: Have NORAD relay intelligence to
dialog: our on board computers?
text: The Technician nods and exits. Defeated, the President slumps
text: sullenly.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: We've moved as many of our forces
dialog: away from the bases as possible
dialog: but we've already sustained heavy
dialog: losses.
text: The President nods his approval absently. Coming out of the
text: bathroom, David overhears.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: I spoke with the Joint Chief when
text: they arrived at NORAD. They
dialog: agree, we must launch a counter
dialog: offensive with a full nuclear
dialog: strike. Hit 'em with everything
dialog: we've got.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Above American soil?
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: If we don't strike soon, there may
dialog: not be much of an America left to
dialog: defend.
text: The Technician returns, his face is white with fear.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: What's the latest from NORAD?
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: It's gone, sir. They've taken out
speaker_heading: NORAD.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: That's impossible...
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: My God, the Vice President and the
dialog: Joint Chiefs...
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: Mr. President, we must launch. A
dialog: delay now would be more costly
dialog: than when you waited to evacuate
dialog: the cities!
text: That stings the President. He considers the option. David is
text: shocked.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You can't be seriously considering
dialog: firing nuclear weapons?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: David, don't...
text: David pushes past her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If you fire nukes, so will the
dialog: rest of the world. Do you know
dialog: what that kind of fall out will
dialog: do? How many innocent people...
text: The General gets up running interference. Constance tries to
dialog: pull David back.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: (stern)
dialog: Sir, i remind you that you are
dialog: just a guest here...
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: David, please...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This is insanity! You'll kill us
text: and them at the same time.
dialog: There'll be nothing left!
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Sit down and shut up!
text: Suddenly Moishe is on his feet, interrupting.
speaker_heading: MOISHE
dialog: Don't tell him to shut up! You'd
dialog: all be dead, were it not for my
dialog: David. You didn't do anything to
dialog: prevent this!
text: As everyone is about to besiege Moishe, the President tries to
text: calm him down.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Sir, there wasn't much more we
dialog: could have done. We were totally
text: unprepared for this.
speaker_heading: MOISHE
dialog: Don't give me unprepared! Since
dialog: nineteen fifty whatever you guys
dialog: have had that space ship, the
dialog: thing you found in New Mexico.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Dad, please...
speaker_heading: MOISHE
dialog: What was it, Roswell? You had the
dialog: space ship, the bodies, everything
text: locked up in a bunker, the what is
dialog: it, Area fifty one. That's it!
dialog: Area fifty one. You knew and you
dialog: didn't do nothing!
text: For the first time in along time, President Whitmore smiles.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Regardless of what the tabloids
dialog: have said, there were never any
dialog: space crafts recovered by the
dialog: government. Take my word for it,
dialog: there is no Area 51 and no
text: recovered space ship.
text: Chief of Staff Nimziki suddenly clears his throat.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: Uh, excuse me, Mr. President, but
dialog: that's not entirely accurate.
text: The President and General Grey turn to Nimziki, shocked.
text: SMASHED AND BURNED OUT CARS
text: laying across the roadway. Suddenly SMASH, Jasmine's
text: maintenance truck BLASTS through.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - CITY LIMITS - SAME
text: With the massive devastation in the b.g., Jasmine drives the
text: maintenance truck down the highway. In the back, the few
text: survivors she's found.
text: In the back, four INJURED PASSENGERS lay across the flatbed as
text: a thin, older man, TEDDY tends to them.
scene_heading: INT. MAINTENANCE TRUCK - SAME
text: Jasmine spots a TALL MAN, his closes in tatters RUNNING down
text: the highway, his arms in the air.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: The end has come! He speaketh
dialog: his word and the end hast come!
text: Jasmine pulls up along side him.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: Hop on. We're heading out to El
dialog: Toro.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: You cannot defy what has come, it
dialog: is the end!
text: The tall man moves off, screaming to the heavens. As Jasmine
text: watches him drift away she SEES...
scene_heading: OVERTURNED MILITARY HELICOPTER
text: Still smoldering from the crash. A woman can be seen inside,
text: still alive. Jasmine jumps out.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: Give me a hand.
text: Teddy joins Jasmine as they pry open the door. Inside, the
text: pilots have been killed, but Mrs. Whitmore, THE FIRST LADY,
text: lays there in great pain, blood across her blouse.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: Let's get her out of here.
text: They erase her from the wreckage, laying her on the
text: ground. Dylan comes over, standing next to his mother.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
text: She's bleeding pretty bad.
text: Suddenly we HEAR the CLICKING of a rifle COCKING.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Who's got the key?
text: Jasmine turns and see a REDNECK leveling his rifle at her.
text: Behind him a small damaged sports car pulls up, packed to the
text: gills with stolen, looted appliances.
speaker_heading: REDNECK
dialog: (yelling to pals)
dialog: Looks like I've solved our
dialog: transportation problem.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: Hey, you're welcome to come with
dialog: us. We're leaving here anyway...
speaker_heading: REDNECK
dialog: We're not. Give me the key.
dialog: (yelling back)
dialog: Get 'em off.
text: Two GUYS rush from their vehicle over to the maintenance
text: truck, pulling the injured off the tailback.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Repent! Sinners! Repent! The
dialog: end hast come!
text: Running up from behind, the Tall Man comes over screaming.
text: The Redneck turns his gun on him.
speaker_heading: REDNECK
dialog: Back off. This ain't your
dialog: business.
text: As the Redneck is distracted, Jasmine spots the bag of
text: fireworks protruding out of Dylan's back pocket.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: You cannot go against the word,
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: REDNECK
dialog: Sure I can.
text: The Redneck SHOOTS the Tall Man. His buddies laugh.
speaker_heading: REDNECK (cont'd)
dialog: Now give me that key, bitch.
text: As he turns back to Jasmine, Boomer starts BARKING wildly.
text: Just as he turns to shoot the dog, Jasmine lights a key ROCKET
text: from the fireworks bag. The rocket BLASTS into the Redneck,
text: his shirt IGNITING ON FIRE.
text: The Redneck drops the rifle, attempting to put out the flames,
text: his cronies rush to his aid. Jasmine picks up the gun, moves
text: in on them.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: This "bitch" was born in Alabama
dialog: with a Daddy who loved to hunt.
dialog: (cocking the weapon)
dialog: So don't think for one second that
dialog: I don't know how to use this.
text: She FIRES the rifle. Quickly the rednecks scamper away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - LATER
text: Dragging a heavy bundle wrapped in his parachute, Steve
text: marches across the desert floor. The alien ARM/TENTACLE
text: dangles out of the parachute.
text: Exhausted, Steve stops to wipe his brow. He hears something,
text: turns around.
scene_heading: STEVE'S POV - THE TRAILER ARMADA
text: Several hundred of the trailers from the refugee camp are
text: headed en mass towards him. Smiling, Steve signals them.
text: The trailers pull up on either side, surrounding him. Miguel
text: leans out of his trailer.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Need a lift?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: When I flew overhead, I saw some
dialog: kind of base, not far.
text: Confused, Miguel checks his map.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
text: It's not on the map.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Trust me, it's there.
scene_heading: EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - LATER
text: Flying over the desert, Air Force One sails over an immense
text: valley, Area 51 below - hangars, a few buildings, a small air
dialog: strip, not much.
dialog: Super: N.I.A. Base - "Area 51", Nevada
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY - LATER
text: Air Force One lands. Wheels touch down, skid.
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR - LATER
text: The large hangar doors open and Air Force One is rolled
text: inside. The President and his entourage are met by a
text: contingent of base personnel led by field operative, LT.
text: MITCHELL. He escorts them to a side hallway.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Lt. Mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the President
text: and his entourage wait in the center of the hall. With a loud
text: hydraulic HUM, the entire hallway begins to SINK DOWN, an
text: enormous ELEVATOR.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Why the hell wasn't I told about
dialog: this place?
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: Two words, Mr. President.
dialog: Plausible deniability.
text: General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look. When the
text: elevator stops, a door SLIDES open.
scene_heading: INT. RESEARCH FACILITIES - CONTINUOUS
text: Stepping out of the elevator, they walk into a large state of
text: the art, sterile clean research facility. It is amazingly
text: well staffed and organized.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I don't understand. Where did all
dialog: this come from? How did this get
dialog: funded?
speaker_heading: MOISHE
dialog: You didn't think they actually
dialog: spent ten thousand dollars for a
dialog: hammer and thirty thousand for a
dialog: toilet seat, did you?
text: The President shoots him a look. They are greeted by a group
text: of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Mr. President, I'd like to
dialog: introduce you to Dr. Okun. He's
dialog: been heading up our research here
dialog: for the last fifteen years.
text: Dr. Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much
dialog: time in isolation.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: Mr. President, a real pleasure.
dialog: They don't let us out much, you
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: Well, I guess you'd like to see
dialog: the big tamale? Follow me.
text: They walk up a ramp at the end of the room. Large heavily
text: enforced doors SLIDE open.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS
text: The group steps inside and nearly gasps at...
scene_heading: THE ALIEN ATTACKER
text: Just like the one that chased Steve. The entourage stares in
dialog: horror and wonder. We can SEE the patch-work repairs they've
dialog: made on the ship over the years.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: She's a beaut, ain't she?
text: Moishe leans close to David and Constance.
speaker_heading: MOISHE
dialog: (smug)
dialog: Never any space ships recovered by
dialog: the government, huh?
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: We've had this for forty years and
dialog: you don't know anything about
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: Hell no, we know tons about them.
dialog: The nearest stuff has only
dialog: happened in the last few days.
text: The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks.
text: David, mouth agape, just stares at it.
speaker_heading: OKUN (cont'd)
dialog: See, we can't duplicate their type
dialog: of power so we've never been able
dialog: to experiment. But since these
dialog: guys started showing up, all the
text: gizmos inside turned on. The last
dialog: twenty four hours have been really
dialog: exciting!
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: People are dying out there. I
dialog: don't think "exciting" is the word
dialog: I'd choose to describe it!
text: The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (calming)
dialog: What can you tell us about the
dialog: enemy we're facing?
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: Not all too dissimilar to us.
dialog: Breathes oxygen, comparable
dialog: tolerances to heat,
dialog: cold...probably why they're
dialog: interested in our planet.
dialog: (suddenly excited)
dialog: Hey, you wanna see them?
scene_heading: INT. MEDICAL RESEARCH VAULT - MOMENTS LATER
text: The lights slowly TURN ON, illuminated the vault. Okun leads
text: the group to a sealed partition.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: This is vault, or as some of us
dialog: have come to call it, the "freak
dialog: show."
text: Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing...
scene_heading: FORMALDEHYDE TANKS - ALIENS
text: Three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks. The
text: murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view. What we do
dialog: see is not pretty.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: When we found them they were
text: wearing bio-mechanical suits.
dialog: Once we got them off, we were able
dialog: to learn a great deal about their
dialog: anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar
dialog: digestive system... no vocal cords
dialog: though. We're assuming they
dialog: communicate with each other
dialog: through other means.
text: David cannot contain his fascination. He steps forward.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What kind of other means? Hand
dialog: signals, body language?
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: Some kind of extra sensory
dialog: perception. Telepathy.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Can they be killed?
speaker_heading: OKUN
text: These three died in the crash.
dialog: Their bodies are as frail as our
dialog: own. You just have to get past
dialog: their technology, which is, I'm
dialog: sorry to say, far more advanced.
text: The President turns to David.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: You unlocked a part of that
dialog: technology. You cracked their
dialog: code.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All I did was stumble onto their
dialog: signal. I don't know how helpful
dialog: I can be...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Show them what you've discovered.
dialog: Work together. We've got to find
dialog: a way to beat them.
scene_heading: EXT. SECURITY GATE - SAME
text: Four armed GUARDS watch the gate. An armada of trucks and
text: trailers heads right for them. They move into position to
text: block their entrance as a blue pick-up skids to a halt before
text: them. Steve stands up from the back of the pick up.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can't open
text: the gates without clearance.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You want to see my clearance?
text: Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him
text: over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the
text: bundled parachute in the flatbed. Steve rips the fabric aside
dialog: revealing...
scene_heading: THE ALIEN CREATURE
text: Still unconscious, the alien stirs. The Guard JUMPS BACK,
text: shitting in his pants. Quickly he signals for the other to
text: open the gate.
text: The armada quickly drives past.
speaker_heading: BLACKNESS
text: Total darkness. Suddenly light pours in as a door is open.
text: We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all
text: peering at us with inquisitive expressions.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: See the gizmos flashing?
scene_heading: REVERSE - INSIDE ALIEN CRAFT
text: Sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing. High tech
text: meets organic organisms. This alien ship looks familiar to
dialog: our own technology and completely different at the same time.
speaker_heading: OKUN (cont'd)
dialog: We've been working around the
text: clock trying to get a fix on all
dialog: this crap. Some stuff we figured
text: out right away.
text: David climbs in, fascinated. He touches everything. Okun
text: points to everything as he describes it.
speaker_heading: OKUN (cont'd)
dialog: This thing we're pretty sure is
dialog: the life support for the cabin,
dialog: this do-hickey over here is
dialog: connected with the engines, this
dialog: crap...we have no idea what that
dialog: stuff is for.
text: David is transfixed by it. He stares at the small screens
text: with flashing light patterns on them.
speaker_heading: OKUN (cont'd)
dialog: But this over here is clearly what
dialog: they use to navigate and guide the
dialog: craft.
text: But David still stares at the small screens.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Someone grab my laptop for me?
text: One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: Find something interesting?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe.
text: The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he
text: quickly flips open and turns on.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: These patterns here, they're
text: repeating sequentially, just
dialog: like...
text: David turns his laptop around for Okun to see. The pattern on
text: David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen.
speaker_heading: DAVID (cont'd)
dialog: ...their countdown signal. Their
dialog: using this frequency for computer
dialog: communications. It's how they co-
dialog: ordinate their ships.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: You know, you're really starting
dialog: to make us look bad.
text: The two men exchange a smile. Another TECHY pops his head
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: TECHY
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: They got one! They got one,
dialog: alive!
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME
text: The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly
text: into the hall. Okun and his staff surround it. Trailing
text: behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: How long has it been unconscious?
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Excuse me Doctor...
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: Three hours.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: Get him into containment, stat.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: My boy is very sick, he needs
text: immediate attention.
text: Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall,
text: the room begins its hydraulic HUM.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: He's dying out. I want him
text: sprayed down with saline.
text: Russell SLAMS his fist against the switch, the room stops. He
text: GRABS a doctor nearby, gets in his face.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: My boys is slipping into a diabetic
dialog: coma. If you don't do something
dialog: about it right now he will die.
text: Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds DOCTOR
dialog: ISAACS, meaning business.
speaker_heading: DR. ISAACS
dialog: O'Haver, Miller, come with me.
dialog: (to Russell)
dialog: Take us to him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - MAINTENANCE TRUCK - NIGHT
text: Headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls
text: to a stop. Jasmine climbs down out of the truck, her face
dialog: ashen.
text: She walks past a sign reading: El Toro Marine Corps Air
text: Station. Tears begin to roll from her eyes. We follow her
dialog: gaze to see...
scene_heading: EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - CONTINUOUS
text: The entire facility is smoldering, the last remnants of the
text: fire burning itself to extinction. Jasmine is devastated.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AREA 51 COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT
text: General Grey and Nimziki are in a heated argument.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: You were the head of the National
dialog: Intelligence Agency! You knew all
dialog: about this. When were you
dialog: planning on informing the rest of
dialog: us!?
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: It had been deemed classified.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: Christ, why didn't you say
dialog: anything about this when they
dialog: first arrived? You could have
dialog: warned us before we launched a
dialog: counter attack that cost us
dialog: hundreds of American pilots!
text: Just then the President enters along with Constance and some
text: other ADVISORS. He examines a paper map of the United States,
text: tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia,
dialog: destroyed?
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: (composing himself)
dialog: And there are scattered reports of
text: sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth,
dialog: And Memphis.
text: The President and his team take seats at the large conference
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY (cont'd)
dialog: We've learned that NATO and
dialog: western allied installations were
dialog: the firs to be taken out. We
dialog: were next. They knew exactly where
dialog: and how to hit us.
text: Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: And our forces?
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: We're down to approximately
dialog: fifteen percent, Sir.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If you calculate the time it takes
dialog: them to destroy a city and move
dialog: on, we're looking at world wide
dialog: destruction of every major city
text: within the next thirty six hours.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: We're being exterminated.
text: The room is quiet. Constance runs her fingers through her
text: hair. The door to the room opens and Lt. Mitchell enters with
dialog: Steve.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Mr. President, this is Lt.
dialog: Colonel Steven Hill.
text: The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking
text: Steve's hand.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Lieutenant, congratulations.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Where is the prisoner now?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: We have him in isolation. The
dialog: doctors are very hopeful he will
dialog: survive.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I'd like to see him.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: The General is concerned but the President is determined.
text: They head for the door.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (to General Grey)
dialog: General, I'm anxious to get back
dialog: to El Toro.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: Didn't anyone tell you? I'm
dialog: sorry. El Toro was destroyed in
dialog: the attack.
text: Steve is shattered, he had no idea.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. EL TORO BASE - NIGHT
text: The injured are gathered around a small camp fire. Jasmine
text: walks up, dumping a box full of charred can goods.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: These should last us a while.
text: As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain. Jasmine rushes
text: to her aid. The color from her face drained, Margaret looks
text: like she's taking a turn for the worse.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: Don't move. Stay still.
text: Jasmine adjusts the bandages as Margaret turns and see Dylan
text: curled up next to Boomer, too adorable. Slowly he starts to
dialog: wake up.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Your son.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: He's my angel.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Was his father stationed here?
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: He wasn't his father. I was kinda
dialog: hoping he'd want the job, though.
text: Jasmine becomes sad, remembering. Margaret changes the
dialog: subject.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: So, what do yo do for a living?
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: I'm a dancer.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Really? Ballet?
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No. Exotic.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh. Sorry.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: Don't be. I'm not. It's good
dialog: money.
dialog: (re: Dylan)
dialog: 'Side, he's worth it.
text: The bandages changed, Jasmine sits down next to Margaret.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: And when the dancing's over? What
dialog: about your future?
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: Funny, it used to scare me when I
dialog: thought about the future.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Guess it doesn't really matter
dialog: anymore.
text: Dylan comes walking over.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: Dylan, come here. I want you to
dialog: meet the First Lady.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: I thought you didn't recognize me.
speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: Didn't want to say anything. I
dialog: voted for the other guy.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - NIGHT
text: Okun and two Medical assistants examine the alien creature.
text: His arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining
dialog: table.
dialog: For the first time we get a good look at the head of this
text: creature, long tentacled-type cords interlocked, covering the
text: face. The doctors attach clamps to each of the cords.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: Everyone ready?
text: The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other. At
text: the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the
text: interlocked cords. As the cords unravel, we SEE that this is
text: in fact a bio-mechanical SUIT as we REVEAL...
speaker_heading: THE ALIEN
text: Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his
text: skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue,
text: alien's skin.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: Do we have life support monitors
dialog: recording?
speaker_heading: MED ASSIST #2
dialog: Yes. If we fuck up it'll all be
text: on tape.
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: Can we get some ventilation in
dialog: here? I can't take this smell.
speaker_heading: MED ASSIST #2
dialog: They've conquered space travel but
dialog: not b.o.
text: As Okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly
text: grabs his forehead.
speaker_heading: MED ASSIST #1
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: OKUN
dialog: Yeah. It's just that stink gives
dialog: me a headache.
speaker_heading: MED ASSIST #2
dialog: He's moving!
text: Instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the

text: Another SHARP PAIN hits Okun who SCREAMS, stumbling backwards

speaker_heading: THE ALIEN
text: Suddenly SPRINGS up, the restraining straps SNAPPING. Before
text: Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles SMASHES her
text: across the face. She is sent sprawling backwards.
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - THE ALIEN
text: Standing before her. In a wink of an eye, he ATTACKS, leaping
text: on her.
text: Together they TUMBLE back into a formaldehyde tank. Hoses
text: are ripped from their sides and STEAM pours out. We get quick
text: glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SAME
text: Mitchell leads the Presidential party down the hall. They
text: turn and enter the Medical lab.
scene_heading: INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS
text: The group slows as they enter the room. They see the
text: containment room through the glass is covered with white
text: steam. Nothing can be seen. It's eerily quiet.
text: Cautiously they approach. Suddenly Okun is SLAMMED AGAINST
text: the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around
text: him. Pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his
text: expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry.
speaker_heading: OKUN/ALIEN
dialog: Release...me.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Open the door. Get him out of
dialog: there.
text: Suspicious, General Grey stops him.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: Wait.
dialog: (to Okun)
dialog: Can you hear me?
speaker_heading: OKUN/ALIEN
dialog: Will kill...release me. Now!
text: They follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling
text: of the containment tank. Suddenly the alien LEAPS DOWN,
text: startling them, landing before them behind the glass.
text: We see he's holding Okun against the glass, speaking THROUGH
dialog: HIM. This is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre
text: creature. Everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by
text: it at the same time.
scene_heading: EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT
text: Through the hundreds of campers and trailers parked outside,
text: Steve runs past until he reaches the open tarmac.
text: A transport helicopter sits on the edge of the landing area.
text: Steve runs up to it and climbs inside.
scene_heading: INT. TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
text: Steve quickly starts it engines, preparing to take off. A
text: SOLDIER rushes over to the cockpit.
speaker_heading: SOLIDER
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: What the hell are you doing? Get
dialog: out of there!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I'm just going to borrow it.
text: The Soldier pulls out his pistol, taking aim.
speaker_heading: SOLIDER
dialog: No you're not, sir.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You really want to shoot me?
text: Steve stares the Soldier down. Reluctantly he lowers his gun.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Shit. I'm gonna catch the hell for
dialog: this.
text: Steve smiles and gives him a quick salute then TAKES OFF.
text: Quickly the bird RISES UP and darts off into the night.
scene_heading: INT. MEDICAL LAB - SAME
text: The President has moved closer to the glass and is talking
text: with the alien. The alien uses Okun like a ventriloquist's
dialog: dummy.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Why did you people come here?
speaker_heading: OKUN/ALIEN
dialog: Air...water...your "sun."
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Where do your people come from?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Where is your home?
speaker_heading: OKUN/ALIEN
dialog: Here...now.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: And before here?
speaker_heading: OKUN/ALIEN
dialog: Many worlds...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Can we negotiate a truce? is
dialog: there room for co-existance?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Can there be peace between us?
speaker_heading: OKUN/ALIEN
dialog: Peace? No peace.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: What do you want us to do?
speaker_heading: OKUN/ALIEN
dialog: Die.
text: The Alien moves closer to the glass staring at the President.
text: Suddenly the President clutches his head in pain.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: Mr. President?
speaker_heading: OKUN/ALIEN
dialog: We kill you...all.
text: The pain becomes more severe and the President SCREAM OUT.
text: There is general panic as people rush to the President's side.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: (to Mitchell)
dialog: Is that glass bullet proof?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: No sir.
text: The General draws his pistol. Mitchell and the other military
text: officers follow his lead. Simultaneously they all begin to
speaker_heading: FIRE!
text: The glass SHATTERS into a billion pieces. The Alien is cut to
text: ribbons, falling backwards.
text: The President collapses. So does Okun. A STAFFER rushes over
text: to Okun, checks his pulse.
speaker_heading: STAFFER
text: He's dead.
text: General Grey moves to the President who slowly recovers.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: Mr. President, are you okay?
text: Woozily the President sits up, a strange look in his eye.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: He wanted me to understand. He
dialog: communicated with me.
dialog: (turning to Grey)
dialog: They're like locusts. They travel
dialog: from planet to planet, their whole
dialog: civilization. After they've
dialog: consumed every natural resource
dialog: they move on. And we're next.
text: The President stands with a new resolve. He stares at the
text: dead alien on the floor.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: (cold)
dialog: Prepare a nuclear strike.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE LAB - MINUTES LATER
text: The research staff are working near the recovered alien

scene_heading: INT. OFFICES - CONTINUOUS
text: Holding a bottle of Jack Daniels, David fishes through a small
text: refrigerator as Constance enters.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just my luck, no ice.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I take it you've heard.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: A toast to the end of the world.
text: David toasts her with the bottle, takes a swig.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: He didn't come to this decision
dialog: lightly.
text: David nods, he doesn't want to argue. He smiles cynically.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You still believe in him.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: He's a good man.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Better be. You left me for him.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I wanted a career. Didn't you
dialog: ever want to be part of something
dialog: special?
text: David stares daggers at her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was part of something special.
text: Constance realizes he means their marriage. She's hurt him

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DARK SKIES - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Who will we reach first?
speaker_heading: COMMANDER
dialog: Houston, Texas. Intercept ETA,

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Oh my God, Houston.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY

speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN #1

speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY

dialog: deploy.
text: Still there is no answer.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: Mr. President?
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT

scene_heading: EXT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - WEAPONS BAY - SAME

scene_heading: INT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - SAME

speaker_heading: PILOT

scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

scene_heading: EXT. SPACE CRAFT - SAME
text: The nuke speeds closer. It HITS the protective shield and

scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE - HOUSTON
text: With the B-2 Stealth Bomber in the foreground, the city behind
text: it vanishes in a FLASH OF LIGHT, blinding us.
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME
text: We can see the extent of the explosion on the targeting map,
text: tracking it -- an expanding ring around Houston.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: (excited)
dialog: It's a hit!
text: The others are still waiting. The monitor shows the night

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSTON - WIDE - SAME

speaker_heading: NIMZIKI

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Can they see it? Did it destroy

scene_heading: TANK COMMANDER'S POV THROUGH PERISCOPE - SAME

scene_heading: INT. ARMORED TANK - SAME
speaker_heading: TANK COMMANDER

scene_heading: INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME
text: On the monitors as well, we can see the target remain. The

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Call them back.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: The other bombers might have more
dialog: luck. We shouldn't just give
dialog: up...
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I said call them back.
text: As the technicians call the bombers away, the President sinks

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - NIGHT

scene_heading: JASMINE'S POV - LIGHTS - NIGHT
text: Bright lights in the sky growing nearer. Slowly the others

scene_heading: TRANSPORT HELICOPTER

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT

speaker_heading: ISAACS
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. President. If only

text: The President puts his daughter down as he sees...
scene_heading: PRESIDENT'S POV - MARGARET

speaker_heading: ISAACS

dialog: There's nothing else we can do.
text: Stunned, the President watches as Patricia hugs her mother.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Hiya Munchkin.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Mommy, we were worried. We didn't
dialog: know where you were.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm right here, baby.
text: Recovering, the President nods for the doctors to leave the
text: room. As they begin to march out, he makes his way over to
dialog: his wife and daughter.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Honey, why don't you wait outside
dialog: so Mommy can get some rest.
text: Patricia kisses her mother, says goodbye and leaves. Out of
text: sight, Margaret winces, fading away. The President grabs her
text: hand for support. She squeezes tightly.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (through tears)
dialog: I'm scared, Tom.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: It's okay. The doctors said
dialog: you're going to be just fine.

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Liar.

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE MARGARET'S ROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: JASMINE
dialog: I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I just wanted to thank you.

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT

speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: A GARBAGE CAN

scene_heading: EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MOISHE
dialog: David, David! What the hell are
dialog: you doing!?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm making a mess.
speaker_heading: MOISHE
dialog: This I can see.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We've gotta burn the rain forest,
dialog: Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute
dialog: the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe
dialog: if we screw this planet up enough
dialog: they won't want it anymore.
speaker_heading: MOISHE
dialog: David, you're drunk.
text: David slips, falls on his ass, hard. Moishe helps him back up
text: on his feet.
speaker_heading: MOISHE
dialog: I think you better sleep this off.
dialog: Go back inside before you catch a
dialog: cold.
text: Slowly David looks up towards Moishe, an idea.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Pops, you're a genius!
speaker_heading: MOISHE
dialog: What'd I say?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A cold? Of course.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE LAB - DAY
text: A large crowd has been gathered here at the lab. General Grey
text: and Nimziki walk up to Constance.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: All right, Connie, we're here.
dialog: What's this all about?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I really have no idea. He just
dialog: said to bring everyone down here.
text: Steve shows Dylan the alien space craft.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Does that thing fly in outer
dialog: space?
text: Steve loos up at the craft admiringly.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It certainly does.
text: When the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks
text: on the hatch door on the alien attacker. The door swings open
text: and David climbs down.
text: Grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, David places
text: the empty can on top of the alien attacker. David turns and
text: faces the gathering.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Could anyone please step back
dialog: away from the craft?
text: They do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft. The
text: Technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him. A
text: loud HUM emits from the craft. David has to yell over it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Lt. Mitchell, would you mind
dialog: drawing your pistol?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: From where you're standing, do you
dialog: think you could shoot that can off
dialog: the alien craft?
text: Mitchell shrugs affirmatively. David gestures for him to try.
text: Taking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS.
text: The bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield.
text: Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the
text: errant bullet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sorry 'bout that. You see, it's
text: protected by the craft's shields.
dialog: We can't penetrate their defenses.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: We know that already. What's your
dialog: point?
text: David walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the
text: craft by cables and starts typing furiously.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My point is if we can't beat their
dialog: defenses, then we must get around
dialog: them.
text: David stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently
text: counting down.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Lt. Mitchell, would you please try
dialog: to shoot it again?
text: Reluctantly Mitchell obliges. This time the can is BLOWN OFF
text: THE CRAFT. Everyone in the room is shocked. The Technician
text: re-opens the craft's door and the loud HUM disappears.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: How did you do that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I gave it a cold.
text: The President is fascinated, he steps closer. Moishe beams
text: proudly at his smart son. Constance is amazed.
speaker_heading: DAVID (cont'd)
dialog: More accurately, I gave it a
text: virus. A computer virus.
text: David turns his laptop around for the President to see.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: Are you telling us you can send
text: out a signal that will disable all
dialog: their shields?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just as they used our satellites
dialog: against us, we can use their own
text: signal against them.
text: David walks over to a diagram he's made showing the
dialog: relationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the
text: smaller alien attackers.
speaker_heading: DAVID (cont'd)
dialog: If we plant the virus directly
dialog: into the mother ship, it would
dialog: then filter down into all the
text: corresponding ships below.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: And just how do we infect the
dialog: "Mother Ship" with a virus?
text: David gestures to the alien attacker behind him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We'll have to fly their craft out
dialog: of our atmosphere and dock with
text: the mother ship.
text: Intrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker,
text: sizing it up. David points to a satellite photo of the
text: underbelly of the Mother Ship.
speaker_heading: DAVID (cont'd)
dialog: We can enter here, upload the
text: virus and set off an explosion
dialog: that could disable it. This would
text: disorient the smaller ship below
dialog: and buy you some time to take them
dialog: out.
text: Constance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: This is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: How long would their shields be
dialog: down?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Once they discover the virus it
dialog: could be a matter of minutes.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: You want us to co-ordinate a
text: massive world wide counter strike
dialog: with a window of only a few
dialog: minutes?
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: With their shields down it might
dialog: be possible.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: Please, you're not buying into any
dialog: of this nonsense, are you? We
dialog: don't have the manpower or the
dialog: resources to launch that kind of a
dialog: campaign.
dialog: (gesturing to the alien
dialog: ship)
dialog: Not to mention that this whole
dialog: cockamamie plan is dependent on a
dialog: machine that no one in the world
dialog: is qualified to operate.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: I wouldn't say that, sir.
text: Everyone turns to Steve who steps through the crowd.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I've seen them in action. I've
dialog: watched their maneuvers. With
dialog: your permission, sir, I'd like the
dialog: opportunity to try.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: That thing's a wreck. It crash
dialog: landed back in the fifties! We
dialog: don't even know if it's capable of
dialog: flying.
text: David turns to the Technicians.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Remove the clamps!
text: Technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of
text: the craft. With a loud CLANK, the clamps are pulled away.
text: For a moment the hulking craft TEETERS unevenly, but quickly
text: stabilizes, FLOATING ABOVE THEM.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Any other questions?
text: Everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Let's do it.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

text: hall. Nimziki rushes to catch up.
speaker_heading: NIMZIKI
dialog: I understand that you're upset
dialog: over the death of your wife but
dialog: that's no excuse for making
dialog: another fatal mistake...
text: The President whirls, grabs Nimziki and SLAMS him against the
text: wall. Holding him tight, the President gets in his face.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: The only mistake I made was
text: appointing a sniveling little
dialog: weasel like you Chief of Staff.
text: Constance is about to intervene when General Grey stops her.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT (cont'd)
dialog: But this is a mistake, I am
dialog: thankful to say, I do not have to
dialog: live with. Mr. Nimziki, you're
dialog: fired.
text: The President releases him and turns to General Grey.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT (cont'd)
dialog: Organize every plane you can find

dialog: to fly them.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GREY
dialog: Yes, Sir.

speaker_heading: REGINALD

speaker_heading: THOMSON

speaker_heading: IRAQI PILOTS.
speaker_heading: REGINALD
dialog: I still get believe this.
speaker_heading: THOMSON
dialog: The Iraqis don't appear altogether

scene_heading: ANGLE - ARABIAN AIR FORCE CAMP

speaker_heading: THOMSON

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

speaker_heading: OFFICER

speaker_heading: OFFICER (cont'd)
dialog: ...with our depleted manpower we

text: Russell pushes his way through the crowd.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL

speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Sorry, sir.
text: Russell gets into his face, desperate.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: You don't understand. I've gotta

speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Why don't you go somewhere and

scene_heading: INT. STORAGE LAB - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MITCHELL

text: Mitchell takes a small black box from a table near by.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL (cont'd)
dialog: This will be attached to the ships

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It's just like an AMRAAM launch

speaker_heading: MITCHELL
dialog: Exactly. Use it the same way.
text: Only the nuke won't detonate on

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Thirty seconds? Isn't that

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We'll be well on our way out of
dialog: there before we shoot that thing
dialog: off.
text: David leans under the attacker where a TECHNICIAN is attaching
text: another device.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: It's the strongest SHF transmitter
dialog: we could get. It'll tell us when
dialog: you've uploaded the virus.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Then cross your fingers the

text: David turns and walks away, Constance following.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: With you? I don't understand why
dialog: you can't just show someone how to
dialog: plant the virus, somebody trained
dialog: for this kind of mission?
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT (cont'd)
dialog: Perhaps it's fate that today, July

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I have a confession to make. I'm

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: STEVE
