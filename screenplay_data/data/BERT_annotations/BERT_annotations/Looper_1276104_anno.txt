dialog: Production draft
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY
text: A pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain.
text: Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas
text: corn field. Sky pregnant with rain.
text: Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones,
dialog: stands.
text: Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from
text: thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet
text: tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged.
text: With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man
text: apart with a single cough of a shot.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck.
text: Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars
text: of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them.
scene_heading: EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY
text: Massive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.)
dialog: Time travel has not yet been
dialog: invented. But twenty five years
dialog: from now it will be. Once the
dialog: technology exists, it will be
dialog: relatively cheap and available to
dialog: the public at large. And so. It
dialog: will be instantly outlawed, used
dialog: only in secret by the largest
dialog: criminal organizations. And then
dialog: only for a very specific purpose.
text: Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse
text: from the flatbed.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: It's nearly impossible to dispose
dialog: of a body in the future. I'm told.
dialog: Tagging techniques, whatnot. So
dialog: when these future criminal
dialog: organizations in the future need
dialog: someone gone, they use specialized
dialog: assassins in our present, called
dialog: loopers.
scene_heading: INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY
text: Cavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch,
text: opens it, and dumps him in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.)
dialog: And so. Thirty years from now. My
dialog: employers in the future nab the
dialog: target, they zap him back to me,
dialog: their looper. And I do the
dialog: necessaries. So the target has
dialog: vanished from the future, and I've
dialog: just disposed of a body that
dialog: technically does not exist. Clean.
text: The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little
text: flare of angry red fire.
scene_heading: EXT. DINER - DAY
text: A sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Joe's
text: truck in front.
scene_heading: INT. DINER
text: Nearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones. A
text: waitress sets down coffee.
text: Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: Bon jour, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Bon jour, Beatrix.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: How's the French?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Slow. How's the coffee?
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: Burnt.
text: Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY
text: Joe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized
text: city on the horizon.
scene_heading: INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY
text: Grungy, heavily fortified. Joe enters and puts his gun in a
scene_heading: basket labeled âLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSESâ
text: Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with
text: a protruding duct taped camera and microphone.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Two, Jedd.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
text: Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket.
text: A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old
text: hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again.
text: In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open.
text: The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash.
text: Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yup.
text: Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves
text: his gun and exits.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Four, Jedd.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
text: High ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city.
text: Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a
text: coffee table in place over it.
text: Puts a bebop LP on a turntable.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!
scene_heading: INT. CAR GARAGE - EVENING
text: Suit-and-tie Joe pulls a tarp off a cherried-out 1992 Mazda
text: Miata. Lingers over it. His baby.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY EVENING
text: Joe drives through the sooty city streets. A muted beep, and
text: he fishes a matchbook sized screen from his pocket.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER - EARLY EVENING
text: A young looper named SETH on the side of the road, kneeling
text: beside a motorcycle without wheels called a SLAT BIKE. He
text: kicks it in frustration.
text: A VAGRANT approaches and SETH pulls a gun, identical to
dialog: Joe's.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Walk around! Around, I'm not
dialog: kidding. Wide around, ya shit.
text: The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Seth.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hi Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's new.
text: Seth kicks the bike.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going
dialog: to the Belle?
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY STREETS
text: Seth and Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick
text: with rubber on the road.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them,
dialog: they get respect.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: They get respect cause they run the
dialog: town. How much did that thing set
dialog: you back? How much?
text: Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I was gonna pull up in it.
dialog: Tonight. Heads or tails, call it
text: in the air.
text: The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Congratulations. You're pulling up
dialog: with me instead.
text: Joe notices the floating quarter.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: And don't, if we're going in, don't
dialog: do that.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Chicks dig TKs.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's tacky, don't do it.
text: Seth catches the quarter, sullen.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: When the TK mutation started
dialog: appearing in the general populace
dialog: it was on every magazine - âNext
dialog: Step in Evolution, what's next.â
dialog: Everyone got tested. But turns out
dialog: this was it, and now it's just a
dialog: bunch of assholes thinking they're
dialog: blowing your mind by floating
dialog: quarters.
scene_heading: EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT
text: A shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city.
text: Flashy people shiver behind a velvet rope, huge black cars,
text: big rollers in odd suits swept in by the bouncers.
dialog: All trying very hard to be big time.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.)
text: Big heads. Small potatoes.
text: Drives past, revving the engine.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Down the street. Joe tosses the keys to an attendant.
scene_heading: EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE
text: A dingy stage door in back of the building. Joe and Seth
text: ring a buzzer, smile for a camera, and the door opens.
scene_heading: INT. COAT CHECK
text: A long dark hallway leads to a tiny antechamber with a coat
text: check room used for guns. BIG CRAIG leans out of it, and
text: stops the two.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: BIG CRAIG
text: No loopers in the club on
dialog: Wednesdays, Joe. Gat men only.
text: Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We'll stick backstage, just meeting
text: up. In and out.
speaker_heading: BIG CRAIG
dialog: Packing your blunderbusses?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hardly. Right Seth?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hardly. I'm with Joe.
text: Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE
text: A claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages.
text: DANGEROUS MEN and half naked SHOW GIRLS weave through.
text: Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace. Seth
text: struggles to keep up.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: So are we - hey -
text: Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.
scene_heading: INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE
text: An ornate parlor, LACY WOMEN entertaining men. A velvet
text: curtained doorway leads to back rooms.
text: Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular,
text: SUZIE. Bold dark eye makeup. A BIG MAN leads her off
text: through the curtains. Joe's eyes drop. Pained.
text: A fat MADAME doesn't look up from her ledger.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat
dialog: Men only.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So I've read.
text: He ducks out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE
text: Joe plods. Dale, the Looper from the pawn shop, passes fast.
text: Curious, Joe follows. They pass Seth, who tails after them.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what-
dialog: Joe?
text: And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.
scene_heading: INT. STEEP STAIRS
text: A starkly lit steep stairwell leads down. Five or six young
text: loopers gather at the top. Joe and Dale join them.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Zach. In there right now, with
dialog: Abe.
text: Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: DALE
text: He closed his loop.
text: This lands heavily on Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No shit?
text: The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another
text: looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder
text: then retracts into the door.
text: The loopers watch him in awe.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: There's a reason we're called
dialog: loopers.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED LOT - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Zach stands waiting, checking his wristwatch, gun in hand.
text: Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joe's.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.)
dialog: Time travel in the future is so
dialog: illegal, that when we sign up for
dialog: this job we agree to a very
dialog: specific proviso.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
text: Zach raises his gun.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: If our employers in the future get
dialog: busted up by the law, their first
dialog: priority is going to be erasing any
dialog: trace of their relationship with us
dialog: ever existing.
text: A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his
text: head kneels in front of Zach.
text: Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: So. If they're busted, and if
dialog: we're still alive 30 years from
dialog: now, they'll find our older self
dialog: and zap him back to us, like any
dialog: other job.
text: Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing
text: several dozen gold bars taped to his back.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: This is called closing your loop.
text: Zach freezes. Looks at the shape of the corpse's face
text: through the sack.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And you get paid out a mythic
dialog: amount of money, and you get a
dialog: handshake and get released from
dialog: your contract. Enjoy the next 30
dialog: years.
scene_heading: INT. STEEP STAIRS
text: Zach reaches the top of the stairs, a grin on his face.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.)
dialog: This job doesn't tend to attract
dialog: the most forward thinking people.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: So are we celebrating?
text: At the bottom of the stairs, a skinny young thug in ratty
dialog: jeans. This is KID BLUE.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: No loopers on fucking Wednesdays!
text: The loopers collectively flip him off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: Suck one, kid!
scene_heading: INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT
text: Lurid and very loud mixture of a dance club and cabaret. One
text: by one the LOOPERS emerge from side exits, sneaking in.
text: Paupers at the feast.
scene_heading: INT. LA BELLE AURORE BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Joe and several other Loopers pass around an EYE DROPPER.
text: Pupils slacken. The drug spins him into a slurred revelry.
scene_heading: INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB
text: Joe staggers out on the dance floor. Miles high.
scene_heading: EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT
text: Joe and the loopers are kicked out by burly GAT MEN, followed
text: by Kid Blue, pointing and yelling at them. The loopers laugh
text: their asses off.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
text: Joe's Miata screams through the abandoned city streets,
text: racing with several other loopers in trucks and sports cars.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Jammed with Seth and Loopers, Joe at the wheel. Still so
text: high. Suddenly one of the Loopers SHOUTS -- Joe slams the
speaker_heading: BRAKES
scene_heading: EXT. VAGRANT VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: Screaming to a halt just shy of a malnourished BEGGAR KID.
text: Caught in the headlights. Behind him, a miserable vagrant
text: village in a field.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Joe stares at the kid, frozen. A moment. Then spins the
text: wheel, peels out. The Loopers hoot and shout. Joe's Miata
text: screams along the dirt road bordering the vagrant village,
text: whizzing past open fires and dirty huddled families.
text: JOE'S FACE - serene and focused. Going somewhere.
scene_heading: EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - DAWN
text: Joe drops Seth off at his building with its bright red
dialog: garage.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sell that goddamn slat bike back.
dialog: That's a lot of stupid money.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I got stupid money.
text: Seth holds his hand under fuzzy dice hanging from Joe's
text: mirror, and they spin.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Alright.
text: Seth stumbles toward his door, checks his pants.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I think I did something. You know
dialog: what? TKs are special. Fuck you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hey Seth.
text: Seth slumps against the car.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, Zach. What's his payout,
dialog: 30? 40? If that? That's not
dialog: going to last you 30 years. And it
dialog: won't get you overseas.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Overseas...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So in five, ten years you're back
dialog: to riding the rails, or worse
dialog: you're like Kid Blue, working as a
dialog: gat man, wagging your dick at
text: loopers and roughing up shop clerks
dialog: for payoff money.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Fuckin Kid Blue.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Save a little something. Alright?
dialog: Cause that'll be yours, and then
dialog: you've got yours and that's all
dialog: that matters, your life is your
dialog: own.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I gots mine you gots yours. I wish
dialog: I was smart like you. Saint Joe.
text: Seth pats Joe's cheek, and waddles off towards his apartment.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: An alarm wakes Joe, red-eyed.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - MORNING
text: In his bathrobe, Joe checks his apartment mailbox. A slip of
text: folded paper inside, with â14:30â handwritten on it.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT
text: Dressed now, Joe double-checks his french book for a phrase
text: and heads out.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY
text: Joe's truck zooms away from the city, into corn fields.
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELD
text: Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away.
text: A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears before Joe.

scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY

text: Following a BUZZ, Joe appears on a fuzzy monitor, standing in
dialog: the hall.
speaker_heading: JOE (OVER SPEAKER)
dialog: Two, Jedd.
text: Jedd opens a slot and takes two gold bars from Joe, then
text: hands him out a small stack of cash.
text: Marks in a notebook Joe's name, the date and the number â2'.
dialog: All the other transactions have the number â4'.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT

text: Joe drinks with Dale, watches a group of Loopers celebrating
text: at another table.
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: What's that, fourth loop closed
dialog: this month?
text: Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his
text: eyebrows at passing ladies.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Fourth.
text: On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can
text: dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As
text: her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE
text: Suzie weaves towards her dressing room. Joe catches her.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You working a shift tonight?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: (REALIZES)
dialog: Yeah, but one of the gat men bought
dialog: me out already. For the night.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Sweetie. I gotta work.
text: She leaves him watching her go.
text: He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen
text: this whole exchange. The Kid smirks.
scene_heading: INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB
text: Joe bursts back into the club with a vengeance.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER
text: Joe staggers in. Not doing so hot.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Looks at himself in the mirror. Eyes red as candy. He pops
text: open a hidden drawer next to his medicine cabinet, pulls out
text: an eye dropper and puts one in each.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: A harsh POUNDING.
text: Joe, flopped on the bed, stirs. Then wakes with a jump,
text: shaky on his feet.
text: Goes to the door. A screen shows nobody in the hall outside.
text: Still punch-drunk, Joe listens. POUND POUND POUND. The
text: window. Joe slides it open. Seth tumbles in off the fire
dialog: escape.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Jesus, Seth.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: They're gonna be here any minute,
dialog: are they here?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, they're not here. Who?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Christ. Joe. Christ.
text: Joe's eyes focus a bit, he tunes in to the situation. Turns
text: the apartment lights off.
speaker_heading: SETH (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: the lights)
dialog: What are you doing? Right. Smart.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Seth, sit down here.
text: CRASH! Seth knocks something over in the dark. Joe opens
text: the fridge, pale light. Seth sits at the kitchen table.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Late to my own funeral. Mom always
dialog: said...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Tell me now.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Christ, Joe. Late to my own
dialog: goddamn funeral. Can you help me?
dialog:

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Seth, what did you do?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You can protect me a little, right?
dialog: Just so they don't... jeez. Oh
dialog: jeez. This is like a nightmare.
dialog: This is a nightmare.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.)
dialog: I knew then what he did so I don't
dialog: know why I asked.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: What did you do?
text: Seth lifts his eyes to Joe.
speaker_heading: SETH
text: He was singing.
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: FLASH: a hog-tied man with a sack over his head appears.
dialog: Singing.
text: Seth, with his gun raised, hesitates.
speaker_heading: SETH (V.O.)
dialog: Through the gag and mask, but I
text: could hear the tune. Deep
dialog: memories, my mom in a dark room,
text: singing. Back warm and safe, when
dialog: I coulda still been good. And once
dialog: I knew it was him... Joe I
dialog: couldn't. I couldn't. I had to
dialog: see.
text: Seth pulls the sack off the man's head.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Joe I can't even tell you. Looking
dialog: in his eyes. I had to let him
dialog: talk, then. I don't even remember
dialog: the words, but I remember believing
dialog: every one of them, or not even
dialog: believing, but submitting. I've
dialog: never felt that small before. I've
dialog: never felt that happy. He told me.
dialog: I remember, there's a new holy
dialog: terror boss-man in the future, and
dialog: he's closing all the loops. The
dialog: Rainmaker, they call him. He told
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: SETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Then he wanted a cigarette and I
dialog: untied him, and he gives me this
text: look. And he just starts running.
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Seth standing with his gun in his limp arm, receding behind
dialog: us as we run away.
speaker_heading: SETH (V.O.)
dialog: And I had my blunderbuss so I know
dialog: he's got about fifteen strides till
dialog: he's out of my range. And they
dialog: come and go, and I just watch him
text: till he's gone.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT
text: Seth breaks down crying.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.)
dialog: This is called letting your loop
dialog: run. It's not a good thing.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What do I do? You're the only
dialog: friend I got Joe you gotta help me
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You fucking idiot coming here.
text: Seth, sucker punched.

speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shut up. Don't move.
text: Goes to the door. Two GAT MEN and Kid Blue stand outside.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: Open up Joe!
dialog: (to the gat man)
dialog: Watch the window.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
text: Joe spins from the door. Considers briefly.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I can't do anything for you Seth.
text: Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No! You gotta hide me! Joe, hide
dialog: me, please Christ please Joe please
dialog: hide me tell em something to buy
dialog: time and I'll leave please-
scene_heading: POUND POUND POUND.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hold on!
text: Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision. He
text: flips the lights on, and briskly pulls back his oriental rug.
text: A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad. He enters a code, opens it.
text: Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big
text: enough for a man. Seth scrambles in.
text: Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face,
text: framed by the gold bars, then closes the safe and smooths the
text: oriental rug.
text: POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door.
text: Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
text: apartment with over-eager purpose.
text: One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's
text: kitchen table. Kid Blue gets in Joe's face.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: That took awhile.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You think it's easy looking this
dialog: good?
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: Tye's going to watch your apartment

scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM

speaker_heading: WITHIN:
speaker_heading: ABE (O.S.)
text: Two minutes.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid

speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: You know why they call that pea
dialog: shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's
dialog: impossible to hit anything farther
dialog: than 15 feet, and impossible to

dialog: A gat has range. Accuracy.
text: His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than
text: Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Alright, cut it out Kid. You're
dialog: gonna blow your foot off again.
text: The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: You're right, it'd be real easy for

text: He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: C'mon.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper.
text: Joe stifles a chuckle.
text: In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the
text: face. Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe.
text: Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory.
text: Lowers his gun.

speaker_heading: ABE (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell is going on out there-
text: The high door swings open fast, SMACKING Kid Blue hard on the
text: side of the head. His gun goes off, firing into the wall.
text: Out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room, guns drawn.
text: ABE, a sallow man in his 50s, appears in the high doorway.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: S'alright, s'alright.
text: Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again.
text: After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the
text: tension breaks.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Alright. Joe.
text: Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily.
speaker_heading: ABE (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn't shoot your other foot
dialog: off, didja kid?
text: The door closes, and the gat men laugh at the Kid.
scene_heading: INT. ABE'S OFFICE
text: Cluttered, with a big desk. Joe sits, Abe hands him a
text: handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: My great grandfather always told my
dialog: grandfather, men's like spiders.
dialog: It's the little ones you gotta be
dialog: careful of.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Dunno I agree with that.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Oh yeah? Well. What the fuck did
dialog: my great grandfather know.
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.)
dialog: This man is from the future. He
dialog: was sent back here by the mob, a
dialog: one way ticket, to run the Loopers.
dialog: That's low effort even for Abe, so
dialog: to pass the time he recruited some
dialog: real muscle, the Gat Men. Now he
dialog: runs the city. Any other city,
dialog: that'd be impressive.
text: Abe settles in his chair. Regards Joe.

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: You know, you don't know, the

dialog: Be new.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay.
text: A beat of silence.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well it was nice chatting with you
dialog: Abe.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: I do like you, Joe. But we're sure
dialog: enough Seth paid you a visit we're
dialog: gonna hafta do something about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Seth?
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: You're expecting we're gonna break
dialog: your fingers with a hammer or
dialog: something awful, and I'm going to
dialog: diffuse that tension right now,
dialog: that isn't going to happen. What's
dialog: going to happen is, I'm going to
dialog: talk for a little, not even that
dialog: long, then you're gonna give up
dialog: your friend.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: My friend Seth? I'm confused.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Well then I'll talk a little. You
dialog: know you were the youngest looper I
dialog: ever hired? You looked goddamn
dialog: ridiculous they said, the
dialog: blunderbuss up to here on you. But
dialog: I remember they brought you in, I
dialog: forget what it was for,
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Watch shop.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: That's yeah, you had rolled one of
dialog: our fronts, a watch shop. And they
dialog: had you, your arms pinned, this
dialog: kid. Like an animal. But you
dialog: looked at me, your hair stuck to
dialog: half your face so just this one eye
dialog: looking at me. And I thought
dialog: what's this kid lived through, what
dialog: he had taken away from him. What's
dialog: he lost. And I could see, like
text: seeing it happen clear as seeing
dialog: it, the bad path in front of you,
dialog: the bad version of your life. Like
dialog: a vision I saw it happen, you
dialog: turning bad. So I cleaned you up
dialog: and put a gun in your hand. I gave
dialog: you something that was yours.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You know I'm grateful, Abe.
text: Genuine. But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: I gave you something that was
dialog: yours. And I remember that kid,
dialog: and I think when you ask yourself
dialog: you ask who would I sacrifice for
dialog: what's mine, I think Seth is deep
text: and cozy inside that circle.
text: Pause. Both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk.
speaker_heading: ABE (CONT'D)
dialog: That hammer's there for something
dialog: else later, that's not, it's a bad
dialog: coincidence.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Show you how much I know you, I'm
dialog: not even gonna break you, just set
dialog: you back a ways.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: ABE (CONT'D)
dialog: We know you've been stashing half

dialog: give up Seth, or you give us half
dialog: your stash. For Seth.
text: Joe holds Abe's gaze for a moment, then his eyes drop and
text: it's over.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Will you kill him?
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: No. Would be too cataclysmic a
dialog: change to the future. What we'll
dialog: do is dangerous in that regard, but
dialog: not as dangerous as killing him,
dialog: and not by twice as having him run
dialog: free.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Joe I let him run more than a few
dialog: days, the boys in the future get
dialog: nervous, then bing! my replacement
dialog: shows up. With a gun. So we'll do
dialog: what we have to do.
dialog: Silence.

scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM

scene_heading: INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE
text: Joe slumps in. Several girls, none of them Suzie.
speaker_heading: MADAME

scene_heading: INT. BLACK HALLWAY
text: A large gat man pushes past Joe.
text: At the end of the hall, Suzie leans in a doorway smoking a
text: cigarette. Not sexy, just tired. She sees Joe, and is about
text: to say no. But she sees Joe's eyes, and doesn't.
text: Exhaling a plume of smoke, she withdraws into her doorway.
text: Joe follows. Through her smoke.
scene_heading: INT. SUZIE'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Suzie naked at the mirror. She goes to Joe, lying on the
text: bed, distant.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I can't remember my mother's face.
dialog: I remember her touching my hair.
dialog: Like this.
text: He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles
text: briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in
text: his eyes.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to go overseas?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Do I want to go overseas? With
dialog: you? Now?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Soon, maybe.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Baby that's sweet. You're a sweet
dialog: boy. You gotta be careful, it's
dialog: easy to think you know someone once
dialog: you been like this. What's in here
dialog: is services rendered.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Is that how it aughta be?
speaker_heading: SUZIE

dialog: 23.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joe gets home. Empty, quiet. Everything in place. He goes
text: to the rug, pulls it aside. Opens the safe.
text: All the gold, and nothing else. One bar juts from the side,
text: knocked out of place.
text: He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a
text: bright smear of fresh red blood.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
text: A hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a
dialog: train yard.
text: It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence
text: bordering the train yard.
text: Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and
text: wraps first his left hand then his right.
text: But stops.
text: On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly
text: carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist.
text: Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve,
text: revealing his clean bare forearm.
text: Then his face changes.
text: Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere,
text: more intricate scarring has appeared down its length.
text: The scars spell out clearly: âBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15
speaker_heading: MINUTESÂ
text: Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up
text: and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast.
text: He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist
text: himself over... and stops again.
text: His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just
text: gone, its stump worn with age.
text: Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well.
text: A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting,
text: leading out of town. Behind him, the city.
text: Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it
text: takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing
text: has changed to a ragged whistle.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
text: He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face...
text: and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS
text: The train yard far in the distance. Old Seth RUNNING back
dialog: into town.
text: He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his
dialog: thumb.
text: He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no
text: right hand, just a stump.
speaker_heading: OLD SETH
dialog: No no no no no!
text: A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying
text: on the sidewalk.
text: He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left
text: hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing.
text: Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the
text: street and into the headlights of an oncoming car.
text: The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows
text: Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the
text: DRIVER. Jams on the gas.
text: Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel.
text: His pant leg crumples. Empty boot tangling with the pedals.
scene_heading: EXT. WIRE STREET
text: The car hits a pole.
text: Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing
text: a foot, one arm gone to the elbow.
text: Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45.
text: He runs. Howling, missing his tongue. Arm totally gone.
text: Then falls as his leg goes to the knees. And he's crawling,
text: an animal form, bellowing wordlessly.
text: Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one
text: arm, slams it.
text: Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings
dialog: open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
text: With no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and
text: Old Seth's head mists open. He slumps to the pavement.
text: Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside.
text: Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical
text: frock smeared with bright red blood. The door SLAMS.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Joe wakes with a start.
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELD
text: Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. He takes his
text: stance. Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons.
text: A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling
text: before Joe. Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots
text: the man in the chest.
text: Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and
text: purplish. Joe hesitates. Puts his hand next to them.
dialog: Similar.
text: He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the
text: shape of the man's face under the cloth sack.
text: Tears it off. An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror.
text: Joe smirks, the spell broken. His face hardens.
scene_heading: INT. PLANT - DAY
text: Joe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and
text: vanish in a puff of distant fire.
speaker_heading: BEGIN MONTAGE:
text: 1. Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers
dialog: celebrate.
text: 2. Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man.

text: 4. Joe in the field, BANG.
text: 5. Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair.
text: 6. Joe in the field, BANG.

text: 8. Joe in the field, BANG. BANG. BANG. His face more

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY
text: Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent.
text: Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw.
text: But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch,
dialog: confused.
text: 2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the
dialog: man is supposed to appear.
text: Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong.
text: 2:32. An eternity. Then, there he is.
text: But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over
text: and has to straighten himself. The man's hands are UNTIED.
dialog: Holy shit.
text: Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on
dialog: the trigger.
text: Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face
text: that stares back at Joe is his own.
text: 57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe.
text: And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his
text: finger eases on the trigger.
text: It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body
text: into a spin.
text: Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
text: The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact
text: blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn
text: jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They
text: caught the blast.
text: In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab
text: one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt
text: and the bar back towards Joe.
text: Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes
text: focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late.
text: Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun
text: aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's
text: head, a fist and then
scene_heading: THE CORN FIELD, HOURS LATER
text: Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him,
text: still squawking French lessons. Sits up.
dialog:

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh god.
text: Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no

dialog: realizing.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Late to my own funeral.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Joe runs, shaky, towards town. Fishes his phone-device from
text: his pocket, chucks it.
scene_heading: EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Across the street, Joe huddles behind a car, breathing hard.
text: Looks up at his lit window. Debating.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY
text: Joe walks silently towards his apartment door.
text: It is ajar. He hesitates. Knows he shouldn't.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT
text: Holding his breath, Joe edges in. It's ravaged, torn to
text: pieces. The floor safe is open, about half the gold bars
text: missing. But the apartment seems empty.
text: Exhaling, Joe works quickly. Knocks a tile aside, pulls a
text: wad of cash from the wall. A heavy jacket from the closet.
text: Eyes dart around the room - what else? But too late --
text: footsteps in the hallway. Joe ducks into the bathroom just
text: as Kid Blue and a TALL GAT MAN enter the apartment.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S BATHROOM
text: Joe crouches. Outside, Kid Blue piles the man's arms full of
dialog: gold bars.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE (O.S.)
dialog: That's twenty four there. I'm
dialog: keeping count.
speaker_heading: TALL GAT MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE (O.S.)
dialog: Two more trips should do it.
text: Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT
text: The Tall Gat Man exits, Kid Blue stays crouched over the
text: floor safe hefting out bars, his back to the bathroom. In
text: the distance, a GUNSHOT. Kid Blue's head perks up.
text: CREAK! From the bathroom. Quick as lightning, the Kid draws
text: his gat and spins - but Joe is already upon him, full sprint.
text: SLAM! Joe tackles the Kid backwards. But while Joe uses his
text: momentum to leap over the OPEN FLOOR SAFE, the Kid tumbles
text: back into it, vanishing inside with a painful thud.
text: Joe scrambles to a stop, lifts the heavy safe trap door and
text: SLAMS it down - just as the Kid's hand grasps the open edge.
text: With a sickening CRACK, the trap door closes on the Kid's
dialog: fingers.
text: A bellowing howl, his fingers withdraw, and the safe door
text: clicks shut. The ELECTRIC BOX rigged to the code pad to
text: crack it clatters off, and whirrrr, CLICK. Locked. Joe,
text: panting, goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts
dialog: clear and earnest:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell
dialog: Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell
dialog: him keep my bars safe cause I swear
dialog: to god I'm going to fix this, I'm
dialog: going to find my loop and I'm gonna
dialog: kill him. Tell Abe-
text: CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door
text: splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right
text: ear explodes.
text: More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls
text: back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now
text: footsteps running down the hall.
text: Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across
text: the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway,
text: shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding
text: as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.
scene_heading: EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT WINDOW - NIGHT
text: 5 floors up, Joe leaps out, hits the fire escape, bullets
text: shattering the window. Blind with blood, ears ringing, Joe
text: barrels down the fire escape. A confused blur of iron steps,
text: slipping and scrambling down, but now the tall gat man is out
text: the window and shooting down at him.
text: Somehow Joe slips and rolls, grabs at thin air, falling -
text: three stories at least, falling.
text: When he hits the ground the world goes away.

text: This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being
text: replayed before our eyes. But when Old Joe does APPEAR, it's
text: different: his hands are tied, his head covered with a sack.
dialog: And something very different happens:
text: Joe raises his gun and without hesitation PULLS THE TRIGGER.
text: Old Joe's chest explodes. He falls dead.
text: Joe approaches the body, and slows. Sensing something. He

scene_heading: INT. FRENCH BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Lazy, dust motes hanging in the sunlight through the windows.
text: Old Joe in bed, in his late 50s.
text: His Wife walks through, says something inconsequential, puts
text: her hand on his foot. Draws it away, fingers sliding off
text: gently. And is gone.
text: We stay with Old Joe. His deep breath. The sun warming the
text: sheets. Running water from the kitchen.
text: His eyes focus on his hand. Written in faded ink on the palm
dialog: is a number we do not recognize: 07153902935.
text: A long moment.
text: With all the violence in the world, the cottage's green front
text: door is KICKED OPEN.
text: Joe runs out of the bedroom half dressed, and GANGSTERS grab
text: him, taking him down with a rifle butt to the head.
text: His Wife is dragged from the kitchen screaming.
scene_heading: EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Dark cars parked out front. We watch the quiet facade for a
dialog: moment too long, violence that we don't want to think about
text: happening inside.
text: Then the door BURSTS open and Gangsters drag Joe out, sobbing

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - DAY
text: Concrete, nondescript. The Gangsters carry Joe in, now hog
text: tied. Put a sack over his head.
text: Lead him towards a machine, an iron monstrosity with a hatch.
text: One of the men taps his watch - hurry. Another man pulls a
text: large lever, and the machine hums, warming up.
text: Joe's face, covered with the sack. Breathing. Remembering:
text: flashes of his WIFE, screaming.
text: Then Joe LUNGES and somehow his hands are loose, he PUNCHES
text: one man, tears off the sack, PUNCHES another man, a flurry
text: and then it's over. He stands among a pile of broken men.
text: Slowly takes stock. Looks at the exit. Looks at the faded
text: number on his blood-smeared hand.
text: A million things in his mind. But just one choice. The
text: machine hums angrily. Ready.
scene_heading: INT. TIME MACHINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Like an iron coffin. Old Joe climbs inside. Braces himself.
text: Closes the hatch behind him.
text: Flash and crack and he is sent.
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY
text: And appears in front of his younger self.
text: The scene now plays out as it did the first time. Joe
text: hesitates, Old Joe gets the upper hand, knocks him out.
text: Old Joe looks around, gets his bearings. Stares at his
text: younger self a moment. Then goes to the truck.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK
text: Old Joe drives the truck into the city.
scene_heading: INT. BODEGA - NIGHT
text: Cramped. Old Joe walks in quickly, gets aspirin, wrapped
text: sandwiches, bandages, big bottles of water. Removes his torn

text: At the register, the CLERK bags everything up. Old Joe pulls

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: On the street outside the building. Old Joe approaches,
text: watching the window high above. Weighing his options.
text: He scans the street. Spots an ARMORED VAN in the alleyway.
text: Movement from behind it - Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man
text: loading their bars in the back.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Shit.
text: Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement
text: between parked cars.
text: It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the
text: apartment building weighing his options.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SOTTO)
dialog: Don't do it. Idiot. Don't do it.
text: After a moment Joe dashes across the street and into the

text: Ducks into shadows as Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man step from
text: the alleyway, wiping their hands.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: Two more trips.
text: They enter the building.
text: Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the
text: sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van. A GAT
text: MAN DRIVER in the driver's seat.
scene_heading: INT. ARMORED VAN
text: The Gat Man Driver watches Old Joe disappear from view.
text: Suspicious, he uncovers a GAT on the seat beside him.
text: When he looks back up Old Joe stands in his headlights,
text: blunderbuss raised. BANG! The windshield shatters, the Gat
text: Man Driver is torn apart.
text: Old Joe runs up, flings open the door, digs through the

dialog: 35.
scene_heading: EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT
text: Old Joe dashes out onto the street as gunfire cracks from the
text: high apartment window. Sharp eyes will notice that Old Joe's
text: right ear is now clipped off, an old wound.
text: He dashes towards the apartment door, gun in hand, but stops
text: when the window five stories above shatters with gunfire.
text: Old Joe backs up, and sees Joe scrambling down the fire
text: escape as the TALL GAT MAN fires down at him.
text: Old Joe takes expert aim with the gat, and fires three shots
text: upwards. The Tall Gat Man's gunfire stops.
text: Joe slips on the fire escape, falls two stories and lands on
text: the hood of a parked car.
text: Old Joe goes to him, checks his pulse.
text: Behind them the TALL GAT MAN hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.
text: Old Joe goes to the tall gat man's remains, picks another gat
text: out of them, and goes back to Joe's inert body on the car
dialog: hood.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Stupid little shit.
text: He lifts him in his arms.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
text: Joe wakes slowly, pained. Lying alone in an abandoned lot on
text: the outskirts of town.
text: Slowly he takes stock of himself. Nothing broken. A tight
text: bandage on his ear.
text: A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link
dialog: fence, the train yard. He was put here for a reason.
text: A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car,
text: heading out of town. Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry.
text: Stands shakily. And walks away from the train yard.
text: Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead, a spotlight
text: zigzagging the area. Joe ducks into shadows, heading towards
dialog: the city.
scene_heading: INT. LA BELLE AURORE BACKSTAGE

scene_heading: INT. ABE'S DEN

speaker_heading: GAT MAN 3

speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Maybe. Sweep the train yard.
dialog: Every second that passes is bad,

scene_heading: INT. ABE'S OFFICE
text: Kid Blue slumps in a chair, holding a rag to a wound on his
text: head. Eyes wet from crying. Abe storms in.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Stupid little shit.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: I can't hear you
text: Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Well that's what happens when you

dialog: stupid little shit.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: I can fix this. I can find him.
speaker_heading: ABE

scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
text: More helicopters sweep the streets, searchlights blazing.
text: Cars with Gat Men circle slowly, shining spotlights
dialog: themselves.
text: Joe leaps from the shadows, ducks behind a dumpster. Barely

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Where would I go if I were me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
text: He sprints into an alleyway, but Gat Men are coming down the

text: Goes back the way he came, turns a corner.
scene_heading: EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT
text: Joe finds himself in front of a familiar BRIGHT RED GARAGE.
text: Seth's apartment. Three stories up, Seth's darkened window.
text: He looks up at it, hesitant but desperate.
scene_heading: INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: A window shatters inward, punched through by a wrapped fist.
text: A big reading hall, empty and dark. The broken window opens,
text: Old Joe slides in. Weaves his way past the reading tables,
text: finds what he's looking for at a desk.
text: A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer.
text: Checking his hand, he inputs the number. Navigates menus and
text: windows, information flashing, searching.
scene_heading: EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT
text: Gat Men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets.
text: Kid Blue sits on the curb, smoking a cigarette. Seething at
text: his bandaged hand. Deep in thought. His eyes lift. An
dialog: idea.
scene_heading: EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The familiar red garage. And three stories up, Seth's lit
dialog: window.
text: Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed
text: on his boot, enters the building.
scene_heading: INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: Old Joe finishes printing several large documents that look
text: like maps. He folds them up, pockets them.
text: Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops.
text: On his hand, a smooth aged scar. Of an arrow. Pointing to
text: his wrist.
text: Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve,
dialog: revealing âBâ then âEâ
text: Then âA then âTâ... He bares his arm, reading the entire
dialog: message.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 38.
scene_heading: INT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The peephole screen on the inside of Seth's apartment door.
text: Kid Blue manipulating a device, a shower of sparks blows the
text: screen out momentarily, and the door swings open.
text: Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the
text: apartment with over-eager purpose.
text: Empty. He deflates. Thinks.
text: Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up.
text: A little manipulating, and the image is rewinding.
text: An empty hall, scanning back half an hour. Then: young Joe.
text: Kid Blue stops scanning, hits âPLAY'. Joe feels around the
text: door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment.
text: Kid Blue exhales. Well Joe was here.
text: Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's
text: about to step away when his eye catches something.
text: He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes. To a
text: live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment.
text: Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour.
text: On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a
text: little, then sits at the table. Head in his hands. Staring
dialog: into space.
text: Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something.
text: Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly
dialog: exits.
text: Kid Blue stops the screen.
text: He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared.
text: The kitchen counter. A blender, sink. Can labeled âCOFFEE.â
text: Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open.
text: It's full of knives.
text: Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small
text: rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook.
text: Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces
text: together. Lights a cigarette.
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELD - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELD
text: We push forward through the green stalks at a brisk pace.
text: They part before us, endless, hypnotic.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING - FLASHBACK
text: The same from the previous flashback.
text: Old Joe in bed, half asleep. A woman's arm under his neck.
text: It slips away, and he kisses its wrist. Comfort, warmth.
text: The woman, leaving. Her hand touches and slides off his
text: foot, moving away.
scene_heading: EXT. DINER - EARLY MORNING
text: Old Joe emerges from the corn fields bordering the sidecar
text: roadside diner. Fumbles in his jacket, dry-swallows four
text: aspirin. Regains his footing. Walks around the diner
dialog: cautiously.
text: Parked in back behind a dumpster, SETH'S SLAT BIKE.
scene_heading: INT. DINER
text: Joe sits at a booth. Old Joe enters, steps up slowly, sits.
text: A moment of silence.
text: Along with his ear, Joe's hand and arm are now wrapped in
text: bloodied bandages. Joe's eyes go to Old Joe's arm. Old Joe
text: pulls his sleeve back and shows him the scar spelling
speaker_heading: âBEATRIX.â
text: Beatrix the waitress steps up breezily.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Please. Black. And water.
speaker_heading: BEATRIX
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
speaker_heading: (TO JOE)

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: OLD JOE

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

dialog: or when the knife is on its way
dialog: down and it's inevitable that

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm not cutting myself again to-
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: I'm not asking you to.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's an interesting question, I've

speaker_heading: OLD JOE

speaker_heading: JOE
speaker_heading: (REALIZES)

speaker_heading: OLD JOE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't care what you're here for,
dialog: whatever you think you're going to
dialog: get from me. More time or whatever
dialog: you want. I can't let you walk

dialog: Because the next 30 years of my

dialog: listen. Listen. alive
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: You know what the voice of god
dialog: sounds like? See now good you're
dialog: confused now but you're listening.
dialog: I hope the voice of god sounds like
text: an old man speaking French. Old
dialog: men speaking French sound like
text: primeval trees in a strong wind,
dialog: just irrefutable. Wise, strong,
dialog: gentle, all these things in
text: harmony, complimentary. At once.
text: Old men speaking French. Young men
dialog: speaking French sound, without
dialog: exception, like weenies. Fact.
dialog: You ever hear a Frenchman under 40
dialog: try to sound threatening? It's
dialog: hilarious. English is a tight t-
text: shirt, flatters the young. Rat a
dialog: tat tat. French is a double
dialog: breasted suit. Young man can put
dialog: it on, but it always feels like
dialog: he's putting something on. Some
dialog: things, you just need the years.
dialog: It's my favorite language.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I've got a life ahead of me that's
dialog: mine and I'm not giving it up for
dialog: you or anybody
dialog:

speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Well you know what you have to do
dialog: then why don't you take your little
dialog: gun out from between your knees and
dialog: do it. One in the head, two in the
dialog: heart. Boy. It's all âanybodyâ
dialog: and âneverâ and then you show up
dialog: here and think you can talk me into
dialog: dying. Well bullshit we both know
dialog: you're not going to kill me.
dialog: Christ you ordered eggs.
text: Old Joe downs two aspirin. Takes a breath.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I know why you couldn't pull that
dialog: trigger. When you're tasked to do
dialog: the unthinkable, your mind, it'll
dialog: do anything it can to stop you.
dialog: Only way is you gotta know why
dialog: you're doing it, in your bones, so
dialog: you can say it out loud to someone
dialog: without apologizing. Or you gotta
dialog: cut yourself off, go numb. But
dialog: that'll kill you, down the line.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It's hard to make eye contact with

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Yeah, that helps actually. That

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You're not winning some pissing

dialog: you didn't know what I looked like
dialog: until yesterday, it makes sense
dialog: that it's easier for you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I wasn't trying to. Do you know
dialog: what's going to happen? Have you
dialog: already done all this, right now,
dialog: as me?
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: No not - exactly - I don't want to
dialog: talk about time travel shit,
dialog: because we'll start talking about
dialog: it and then we'll be here all day
text: making diagrams with straws. It
dialog: doesn't matter.
dialog:

dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: When I hurt myself now, it changes
dialog: your body. Do my actions change
dialog: your memories?
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: It doesn't matter because I don't
dialog: know how it works. Nobody knows
dialog: how it works. Time travel was an
dialog: accident, thirty years from now the
dialog: smartest men in the world know
dialog: exactly one thing about it that you
dialog: don't: they know to be scared to
dialog: death of it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: My memory is cloudy, there's a
text: cloud. It's a, it starts clear
text: then gets cloudy as it goes back..
dialog: Goddammit hand me those.
text: Straws. Joe passes him two.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: And the salt. No, the pepper. The
dialog: pepper.
text: Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart, parallel, and
text: pours pepper between them, thus:
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ok, the span between the straws is
dialog: a timeline of the next 30 years.
speaker_heading: THIS
dialog: (the left straw)
dialog: is the present moment, right now.
speaker_heading: AND THIS
dialog: (the right straw)
dialog: is the moment thirty years from now
dialog: when I was sent back. The machine
dialog: is tuned to a fixed time, you know
dialog: that, 30 some years, it's not
dialog: adjustable.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What's the pepper?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: The pepper is a sort of fog. See
dialog: my memories start clear here,
dialog: (at the right straw)
dialog: but as they go back they get
dialog: cloudier, until they're totally
text: obscured. It's like a fog.
dialog: Because my memories aren't really
dialog: memories, they're one possible
text: eventuality now, and they grow
text: clearer or cloudier as they become
dialog: more or less likely. But then they
dialog: get to the present moment
dialog: (the left straw)
text: And they're instantly clear again.
text: Like a wall of fog moving forward
dialog: with the present moment. I can
dialog: remember what you do after you do
dialog: it.
text: He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it
text: pushes the pepper with it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So you can
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: And it hurts.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So when we're apart you can
dialog: remember what I do. After I do it.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Uh huh. But
text: Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates. Old Joe
text: awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a precise description of a
dialog: fuzzy mechanism. Time travel fucks
dialog: everything, my brain and body try
dialog: to catch up. It's messy. That's
dialog: why it's dangerous. And it hurts.
dialog: All I know I know two things for
dialog: sure. I know what's happening in my
dialog: head. And I know that you're still
text: going to meet her.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who?
text: Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his
text: pocket, clicks it open. We don't see inside it, but he
text: stares at it intently.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a woman, what? I'm going to
dialog: fall in love with?
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: She's gonna save your life.
text: Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time,
text: and holds it. Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest
text: sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it,
text: he breaks off his gaze.
text: The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he
text: turns it into anger.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: For a long time at the beginning
dialog: she thought we'd have a baby. She
dialog: would have been a good mother. She
dialog: wanted that so much. And now I'm
text: saying sorry to a picture.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: She's. How is she, you said save
dialog: my life.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Your life. Let's look. At your
dialog: life. You're a killer and a
dialog: junkie. And a fucking child
dialog: mentality, âMy life,â âwhat's
dialog: mine.â Save your life, you're
dialog: asking how? The question is why.
dialog: Why would someone waste themselves
dialog: on you, give up the good life they
dialog: had, sacrifice a good life to love
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: My life is my own, I don't need it
speaker_heading: SAVED
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Shut your fucking child mouth.
dialog: She's going to clean you up and
dialog: you're going to take her love like
dialog: a sponge and you're both going to
dialog: pretend that she's saved you,
dialog: you're so self absorbed and stupid.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Yesterday. Thirty years from now

text: The line goes dead. Old Joe hangs up. Looks at his hand,
text: with the number. Standing in his cottage, before he was sent
text: back. Through the window, his wife working in the garden.
text: Old Joe closes his hand.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (V.O.)
dialog: This is a piece of identifying

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: OLD JOE

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It happened to you, it doesn't have

dialog: (points: the pocket watch)
dialog: You got her picture in there? Show

speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I guarantee the instant I look at

speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Gone.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: She'll be safe. And then we can

text: A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it.
text: Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: No you don't understand. We don't
dialog: have to give her up. I'm going to
dialog: tell you why I'm here now.
text: He puts his hand on the folded papers.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna save her.
text: A quick beat. Joe goes for his gun. But Old Joe is fast, he
text: jams his foot into Joe's crotch, crushing the hidden gun into
text: him. Joe cries out, Old Joe grabs his hair and plants his
text: face into the table.
text: When Joe's hands go to his face Old Joe grabs them and pulls.
text: Foot in his crotch, pulling his arms tight over the table.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (CONT'D)
text: The Rainmaker is alive right now.
dialog: Living here, somewhere in this

dialog: I know how to fix this, I won't

text: Joe's face loosens, his eyes on their coffee cups.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's been awhile since we've gotten
text: a warm-up.
text: Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet.
text: Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left. Fled.
text: Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the
text: hair, dragging him like a doll. Joe's blunderbuss clatters
text: to the ground. Old Joe drags him to the window. They look
text: out. Nothing in the parking lot. Too quiet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: It's been thirty years for me, so
dialog: it's hard to remember. When you

dialog: the security tracker. Right?
text: Joe's fearful face says âno.' Old Joe draws his gat.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Make it to the field, you can lose
dialog: them in the field. Go east and hop
speaker_heading: A TRAIN
text: Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His
text: papers and gun fall. The diner door EXPLODES.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I've got him! He's here!
text: A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old
text: Joe gets the gat.
text: With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there
text: are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe
text: returns fire, glass breaking and chaos.
text: Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks.
text: Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet.
text: Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the
text: booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have
text: their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath
text: the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Shit.
text: Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind
text: Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the
text: broken window, jumps...
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF DINER - MORNING
text: ...and hits the dusty parking lot running. Towards the corn.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF DINER
text: Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their
text: guns trained on the diner door. Three Gat Men burst out,
text: followed by Joe.
speaker_heading: DINER GAT MAN
dialog: The back, he's running!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Around back!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
text: They all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the
dialog: corn but not there yet.
text: The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after
text: him while running but they're too far away (and they're
text: running) so nothing hits. Joe blasts at the old man blindly,
text: sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the
dialog: dust.
text: When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four
text: of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers
text: slow to a stop, doubled over, panting. Defeated.
text: It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is
text: there with them. It takes another second for Joe to realize
text: that the dynamic has changed. He turns and runs back towards
text: the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit. One of the
text: Gat Men fires.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: Alive! No, alive!
text: Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition.
speaker_heading: CLICK.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No fuck no fucking piece of shit
text: CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the
text: moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike
text: the engine turns over with a ROAR.
text: The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the
text: open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The
text: bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground.
text: Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running
text: back to the Gat Men.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: The tracker! Get the tracker!
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELD
text: Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks. He
text: BAILS, snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful
text: stop. The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks, quickly out
dialog: of sight.
text: Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn
text: paper from his pocket. On one side, the number Old Joe
text: scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over. It's a map.
text: Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and

text: One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK.

scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - DAWN
text: A bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts
text: the dead stump of an old tree.
text: A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the
text: trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart.
text: Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near
text: distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn.
text: Sara focused on her work as the sun rises.
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELD - EARLY MORNING
text: Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE, and with a

text: fields, spraying something chemical.
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
text: Sara makes coffee.
scene_heading: EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - EARLY MORNING
text: She sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible
dialog: cigarette.
text: Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it
dialog: has been here for awhile.
text: The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white.
text: Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee. Not going
dialog: anywhere.
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Blinds drawn, dark. A FIGURE lies in bed. Sara steps in,
text: puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: C'mon baby. Time to get up.
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Cooking eggs. The front door bangs. She looks up.
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE FOYER
text: The screen door bangs in the wind. Sara inspects it. The
text: latch is broken. She sighs.
text: Then freezes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
text: Through the screen door, some fifty yards across the front
text: lawn, the dark figure of a MAN stands at the edge of the corn
text: fields. Watching her.
text: She watches right back for a long moment.
text: Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no
text: hesitation at all plows outside.
text: The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN
text: Sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn,
text: shotgun extended. Not fucking around.
text: Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn
text: fields, where she plants herself and shouts:
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Listen up fucker. I have shot and
dialog: buried three vagrants in the past
dialog: year. If you want to know the
dialog: Christ's honest truth I'm starting
dialog: to get a taste for it. So I don't
dialog: care what hobo sob story you've
dialog: got, I get a dozen a week and it
dialog: cuts no cash with me. It's me and
dialog: my husband here, we're broke and
dialog: angry at our lot in this world and
dialog: heavily armed. So take some corn
dialog: and move on, but if you show your
dialog: face again I will cut you the fuck
dialog: in half.
text: Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara
text: turns, walks briskly back.
text: Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He
text: takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a
text: clear sight line at the house.
text: His gun on his knee.
text: JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces.
text: Pinches his eyes. Headache.
text: The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map.

dialog: I can do it again.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: You can fuck up again? Really.
dialog: You know what happens to me if I

dialog: Put your gat on the table.
text: Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he

speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: I wanted you to say I did good,
dialog: that's all I wanted. This is all I
dialog: have.
text: Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the

dialog: table.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please just give me one more
dialog: chance, I'll bring him here alive
dialog: and hold him and you can put a

scene_heading: INT. STEEP STAIRS

scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE

text: The Kid blubbers and bleeds. Humiliated. But he pulls

speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: I'm gonna make this good again. I
dialog: will. I'm gonna be back.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
text: Raining. The Gat Man pushes the Kid out the back entrance
text: door, into the alley. The Kid instinctively turns towards
dialog: the street.
text: But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley. The
text: Kid realizes what this means. Everything changes.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: Oh no. Oh no no no no
text: He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps,
text: begs, clasps at whatever he can grab.
text: The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE (CONT'D)
dialog: No! No! No no no no!
text: Shrieking. Annoyed, the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the
text: concrete. The Gat Man pulls his gun, raises it without
dialog: ceremony.
text: BANG. The Gat Man's face explodes. Staggers, his gun FIRES
text: into the wall. He drops like a doll.
text: Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating. His pant leg
text: hiked up, showing his boot with its holster.
text: In his mangled left hand, the small caliber PISTOL he keeps

speaker_heading: KID BLUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh.

scene_heading: EXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Silent and still. Sara comes out onto the front porch. She

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT
text: Sara stalks towards the barn, shotgun in hand. Shadows loom
text: across the yard. All is silent.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
text: She reaches the barn. A hard pool of light from a mounted
text: floodlight falls off to inky darkness.
text: Hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps
text: off. In its absence the darkness swarms.
text: She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows. Stops.
text: Turns. In the darkness by the barn, crunch crunch. Crunch.
text: And maybe a shape. Deep in the swarming dark.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey. Who's there.
text: Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back.
text: Quiet but definite - crunch crunch. And now, definitely a

speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop right there. Stop!
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELD - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe slumped over unconscious where we left him, in the corn.
text: Sara's shout wakes him with a start. Sweating, pasty.
text: Disoriented. Something is wrong with him.
text: In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah
text: backing away from the barn. The dark hulking figure of a man
text: pursues her slowly but steadily.
speaker_heading: JOE
speaker_heading: SHIT
text: His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he
text: scrambles in the dirt for it.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT LAWN
text: Sara backing up still, shotgun leveled. The man, still in

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You stop right there, you stop!

scene_heading: INT. 2ND STORY BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: From a CHILD'S POV - We run across a darkened bedroom to the

speaker_heading: SEE:
text: Sara on the ground, fumbling the gun. In trouble. The DARK

text: At the last moment, from the corn fields, JOE runs into the

dialog: at the Dark Man.
dialog: And the Dark Man STOPS.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe's gun leveled, face set. But the porch light on the

text: It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome. A

speaker_heading: SARA

scene_heading: EXT. SECOND STORY BEDROOM WINDOW

speaker_heading: SARA

speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey. Up here, at the light. Hey.
text: Sara SLAPS HIM. Hard. His eyes snap open. He sees her face.

speaker_heading: JOE
speaker_heading: (TOTALLY GONE)
dialog: My head... splitting apart... time

speaker_heading: SARA

speaker_heading: JOE
speaker_heading: DROPPED

speaker_heading: SARA

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A day.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: One day. Wow.
text: She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in

dialog: sweating.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: Thirsty. I can't feel my legs
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You're withdrawing from a synthetic

dialog: but it's this bad a day in, without

text: Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine

dialog: 58.
text: She stands quickly without a word, vanishing into the house.
text: Joe lies still, breath shallow. Turns his head, hazy.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: Thirsty. Thirsty.
text: Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him
text: through the front door. A young boy steps out onto the
text: porch, 6 years old, named CID.
text: Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he
text: kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a
text: straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup
text: with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks.
speaker_heading: SARA (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (SHARP)
dialog: Cid. C'mere monkey.

text: Kisses him.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: Night Sara.
text: Lingers over him in the pale light. Then goes.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: A darkened highway, the lights of the farm house distant. A
text: small STAKE BED TRUCK rumbles up, stops on the soft shoulder.
text: Sara at the wheel. Sits a second. Then climbs out.
text: Roughly pulls Joe out of the flatbed. He lands in the dirt.
text: Sara avoids looking at him, closes up the flatbed.
text: Joe weakly grabs her ankle. She pries his hand off, and
text: discovers CID'S CUP in the dirt beside him. Takes it
text: angrily, strides back to the truck.
scene_heading: INT. STAKE BED TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
text: Sara gets in, drops Cid's cup on the seat beside her. Looks

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Ssssshhit.
scene_heading: INT. BARN - NIGHT
text: Sara lights a gas lamp. Threads a hose from a tank of water

speaker_heading: SARA

dialog: we're gonna talk.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

text: The last thing she does is handcuff his wrist to the cot and
text: take his gun. On her way out she puts it on a bench beside
text: the door, and turns out the floodlight.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING
text: Dawn breaks. Exhausted Gat Men dutifully patrol the streets
text: with flashlights, stopping every passerby.
text: On the outskirts of the city. Vagrant fires burn distant
text: orange. A large drainage pipe drips into a brackish creek.
scene_heading: INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL
text: Underground. We move through it.
scene_heading: INT. RUNOFF ROOM
text: Cavernous space beneath a high street grating, damp and cold.
text: Old Joe sits on the ground, methodically cleaning and loading

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY)
text: A bank of fog clears, revealing Sara's face looking down at
text: us. She slaps us hard.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hey.

scene_heading: INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT
text: A fist comes straight at us. SMACK!
text: We reel back, revealing: the Paris club, crowded and rowdy.
dialog: A piece of Old Joe's life that we've seen before.
text: Joe (mid 40s) lies on the ground, lip bloodied, laughing
text: hysterically at a YOUNG PUNK who has just hit him. A bar
text: fight blossoms in slow motion all around.
text: Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his Wife for the

dialog: frame.
scene_heading: INT. RUNOFF ROOM
text: Inside Old Joe's pocket watch, a picture. Of his WIFE.
text: The sun breaks in through the grate above. Old Joe closes

text: JOE'S FACE - wrecked, but his eyes flutter. Blink.
scene_heading: INT. BARN - MORNING

scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING
text: Old Joe hides in the trees across the street from a suburban
dialog: track home.
text: A young boy in a bright jacket runs out the front door and
text: off down the street.
text: Old Joe checks the folded map in his trembling hands. On it,
text: this house is circled in black, exactly like Sara's farm.
text: Stuffing the map in his pocket, he pushes out through the
dialog: trees.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN - MORNING
text: Sara approaches the barn, her shotgun in hand.
text: Joe sits on the ground just outside the open barn door, the

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Toss it.

speaker_heading: JOE

dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm at thirty percent.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Take it slow and by the end of the
dialog: week you'll be at fifty. Good.
text: She tosses him a key, he unlocks his handcuff.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I took you in so you wouldn't die,
dialog: and now you're not going to die.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: So take the morning to rest, then
dialog: you need to get off my farm.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I can't do that.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I need to stay here for a little
dialog: while longer.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I am not cool with that.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well I'm sorry too, you just lost
dialog: your take the morning to rest
dialog: privileges, get off my farm.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No.
text: Sara raises the shotgun.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Get off my farm.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No. You couldn't scare a retarded
dialog: hobo with that thing. Literally.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: This is a Remington 870, one blast
dialog: could cut you the fuck in half.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And that's, that's telling. You're
dialog: holding a gun. I say I'm not
dialog: afraid, so you describe the gun to
dialog: me. But it's not the gun I'm not
dialog: afraid of.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What are you gonna shoot in the
dialog: air? Blow a hole in your barn? To
dialog: scare me? Go ahead. But you
dialog: couldn't let me die, you won't kill
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: So now I saved your life that makes
dialog: me weak?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Look I'm not a threat to you or
dialog: your boy. I need to be on your
dialog: property but I'd prefer to not have
dialog: any contact with you at all, I'll
dialog: stay in the fields. There's just
dialog: one thing you need to do for me,
dialog: and you won't have to deal with me
dialog: again.
text: He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it. Tosses it over
dialog: to her.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Just, verify for me that's your
dialog: house on the map. So I know I'm in
dialog: the right place.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A map.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: That's my house. Why is it marked?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Doesn't matter. Ok. I'll be out
dialog: of the barn in an hour, if you can
dialog: spare it I'll take the water jug
dialog: with me. Does that well have
dialog: water? I'll fill it from there.
text: Sara turns the map over. Sees the NUMBER that Old Joe wrote
text: on the back. 07153902935.
dialog: And everything changes.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What is this.
text: She shows him the number. She is not asking what the number
text: is - she knows. Joe is suddenly not so relaxed.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: What is this.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Does that mean something to you?
text: For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her
text: eyes. Sara stares daggers, searching. Very different than
text: she was ten seconds ago.
text: Joe scoots back
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: HEY-
text: And without hesitating Sara hefts the shotgun and SHOOTS HIM.
text: BLAST! Rips his shirt open bloody, blows him back screaming.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK
text: Old Joe STOPS in his tracks, children running around him.
text: His hand goes to his temple.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN - DAY (OLD JOE MEMORY)
text: Fog clears from Sara blasting us with her shotgun.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK
text: Old Joe's hand runs from his temple to his neck. Feels a new
text: but old scar, just a little divot behind his ear.
scene_heading: INT. BARN
text: Sara drags Joe in by the foot. She heaves the barn door
text: closed. In the lamp lit dark Joe rolls and groans in the
dialog: dirt.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Who are you?
text: She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're right I'm not a killer but I
dialog: am fine with how a blast of rock
dialog: salt to your face won't kill you.
dialog: Who are you and what are you here
dialog: for? Who are you?
text: Joe breathes hard, bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his
text: nose. But he forces calm. A beat. Then he starts talking.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Time travel hasn't been invented
dialog: yet. But in thirty years it will
dialog: be.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - DAY
text: A suburban park. On its far end, a birthday party.
text: The YOUNG BOY in the bright jacket we saw run out of the
text: house earlier sits alone under a tree.
text: Old Joe approaches him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Hi. Daniel, right? I'm Chad's
dialog: father. Aren't you going to come
dialog: over? We're doing cake.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's ice cream cake and I can't eat
dialog: ice cream. Cause of the milk.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Well you should join the party even
dialog: if you don't have cake. You have a
dialog: birthday coming up?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: In July. We were gonna go to the
dialog: lake but I don't think we are now.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass. Having trouble
dialog: breathing.
scene_heading: INT. BARN
text: Sara sits. Joe weakly talks, the end of a long explanation.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I can't go back to the city and
dialog: find him cause Abe, the boss, all
dialog: his men are going to search the
dialog: streets 24/7 till they turn up me
dialog: or... him. All I have is this map.
dialog: And that he's coming here.
text: Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: A Looper.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah. Did you know about Loopers,
dialog: what we do
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I've heard stories. So he's coming
dialog: here to murder me and my son
dialog: because he thinks we might be this
dialog: Rainmaker. And once he kills the
dialog: Rainmaker, what happens?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I think... he thinks, the instant
dialog: the rainmaker dies, he'll never
dialog: have been sent back, so he'll just
text: vanish, and be back with his wife.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET
text: The same track home Old Joe studied from the trees earlier.
text: Daniel trots towards it, coming home from the birthday party.
scene_heading: INT. BARN
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Who is he? The guy you let run?
dialog: Just some random guy from the
dialog: future?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah. Someone. You know what
dialog: these numbers mean.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN HOME BACK YARD - DAY
dialog: Well tended by someone who loves growing things. Laurels,
text: ivy on trellises, flowers and trees.
text: Daniel comes through the side gate. Lifts the back door
text: matt, revealing a dusty key.
scene_heading: INT. BARN
text: Sara takes a pen from a workbench. Shows Joe the numbers:
speaker_heading: 07153902935
text: She draws lines with the pen, thus:
speaker_heading: 07/15/39[02935]
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: This is my son Cid's birthday. And
dialog: this is the hospital he was born
dialog: in.
text: Joe's face, taking this in.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN HOME BACK YARD
text: Old Joe. Sitting in a corner of the yard. Face set hard.
text: Daniel stands, key in hand. Drops the matt. Slow motion.
text: Turns. Sees Old Joe, standing now.
text: Stillness between them. OLD JOE'S FACE. Struggling to be
text: stone, and then it is.
text: He draws his gun in one fluid motion and FIRES.
text: We don't hear the shot. We just hear the garden, the wind
text: through the plants.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
text: And we just see Old Joe's face. Struggling now to remain
dialog: stone.
text: Numb he puts his gun away and exits.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK
text: Old Joe walks across the park. Map in his hand. Children
text: play in the distance. Children's voices all around.
text: Old Joe spins, his breath up into his head.
text: The map falls to the ground. The park around him, green and
text: full of children.
text: He keels over onto his knees and cries. Grabs the grass,
text: holds it in his fingers, thick and green.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
text: The Wife stands at the edge of a bed. 35 and Full of life.
text: Old Joe on the bed. Mid 40s.
text: She unsnaps her GREEN DRESS and it falls, leaving her naked
text: in the sunlight.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: On the bed. Old Joe and the Wife. Faces close. Drifting
text: into sleep. From a neighboring apartment, a BABY CRIES.
text: Loud and insistent.
text: Old Joe opens his eyes, joking-annoyed at the crying baby.
dialog: âGod you have to be kidding me.â
text: Then he sees her face. Her smiling eyes, listening to the
text: neighbor's baby cry. Like she's listening to music. She
text: touches his hand.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK
text: Old Joe. Staring at the grass. On the map beside him:
text: three circled houses around the city. And the torn corner.
scene_heading: INT. BARN
text: Sara holds the torn piece of map in her hands. Their house
dialog: circled.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Would he do this?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Think about what doing this would
dialog: fix. What he thinks it would fix.
dialog: Sara caught that, and she did not like it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: He'll kill the other kids on that
dialog: map and then come here last. Put
dialog: off facing me.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: If he comes here, can you stop him?
text: She turns the paper over in her hands.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Given this, if I erred on the side
dialog: of caution and believed all of
dialog: this, I'm asking. If I trusted
dialog: you. Will you stop him before he
dialog: gets to my son?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I've lost my life. I kill this
dialog: man, I get it back. You can trust
dialog: me.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - LATER
text: They sit on the steps, Joe stripped to the waist. Sara picks
text: salt chunks from his chest with tweezers and antiseptic.
text: Joe surveys the surrounding land, cleaning his gun.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We're surrounded by the corn, that
dialog: leaves us blind. He can get within
text: fifty yards of the house without a
text: hawk spotting him.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What makes sense is, we burn the
text: fields, level them.
text: Sara realizes he's seriously asking.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No you cannot burn down my corn
dialog: fields.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What kind of equipment's in the
dialog: barn?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Farm equipment.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Nothing that shoots.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No farm equipment that shoots. No.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
text: Joe finishes assembling his gun. Sara's eyes flick to it.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: You use what you need, set up
dialog: anywhere. But one thing, I don't
dialog: want you talking to Cid. I watch
dialog: my son, you watch the corn. That's
dialog: the deal.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Good by me.
text: He hisses as she applies antiseptic to a gash in his arm.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Hold still. Easy for things to get
text: infected on a farm, start falling
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: (SOTTO)
dialog: Pussy.
text: Caught off guard, Joe almost smiles. Then grimaces.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: If I'm out here and you're in the
dialog: house we're gonna need some way to
dialog: communicate.
speaker_heading: SARA
text: There's a dinner bell down by the
dialog: barn, ring that if someone's
dialog: coming, I'll hear it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Dinner bell. We need walkies, or
text: buzzers.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Dunno what we've got but I'll look.
text: She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Cid.
text: She goes to take him inside.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Got any ammo for that shotgun?
dialog: That isn't a seasoning?
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS
text: Sara leads Cid back into the house.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: How's the maths coming?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: I wanna help the man.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Help him what?
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: I could help him with my toys.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Baby. Listen. I need you to stay
dialog: away from that man. Okay? Let him-
speaker_heading: HEY
text: Cid squirms out of her grasp, bats her away with a light but
text: angry slap. She grabs his arm harder.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Let him do his thing, but you stay
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: Is he not good?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well we're gonna see what he is.
dialog: But you stick with me. Yeah?
scene_heading: INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - EVENING
text: Old Joe's little hide-out. He violently washes his hands in
text: a trench of water.
text: Slumps back, eyes blood red. Streaks of tears down his face.
text: Reddish light fading to blue through the grating high above.
text: Runs fingers across his forehead, spreading cooling water.
text: His eyes close. His breathing shallows.
text: In one hand he holds his pocket watch. He places the other
text: on the gat. The map beneath it.
text: Daniel's map location CROSSED OUT. Two others remaining.
text: And the missing corner, edge torn.
text: CLOSE ON Old Joe's face. Slipping to sleep.
text: Then from nowhere a CHILD'S HAND enters frame and rests on
text: his forehead. Old Joe's eyes gasp open with terror
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
text: but it's Joe who wakes up with a start. Slumped against the
text: steps, gun in hand.
text: Cid's hand on his forehead. Cid steps back quickly, puts his
text: finger to his lips. Shhh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT
text: Cid leads Joe inside, beckoning him to follow.
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN
text: Dark. Cid leads Joe to the kitchen table. Laid out on it:
text: an arrangement of toys.
text: With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a
text: flashlight and sets it on the table.
text: Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out
text: wires. Hands moving fast. Joe sits, watching Cid.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: Hand me that Phillips.
text: Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working.
speaker_heading: CID (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me if you hear her coming.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What are we doing here?
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: Commundication.
text: He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and
text: an identical one next to Joe lights up.
text: The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly.
speaker_heading: CID (CONT'D)
dialog: But I need to make it stronger.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How do you do that?
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: Bigger battery.
text: Joe idly fingers a toy.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Smart.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: Do you kill people?
text: Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows.
scene_heading: AFTER AWHILE:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Let's say I kill people.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: With your gun?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Uh huh.
text: Cid looks at him in the dark. Not scared at all. Then he
text: goes back to fitting the backing on a toy.
text: A long beat, Joe thinking.
text: Broken by a PIERCING NOISE.
text: They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is
text: shrieking, sirens blaring.
text: Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off,
text: they both freeze.
text: And look up at the ceiling.
text: Silence in the house.
text: With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck
text: from Joe and finishes up his work.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: How long have you and your mom been
dialog: on the farm?
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: She's not my mom. My mom got
dialog: killed when I was a baby. Someone
dialog: bad, bad men killed her.
text: Cid sets the two finished BUZZERS on the table.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: Sara doesn't think I remember cause
dialog: I was a baby. But I remember my
dialog: mom. I couldn't stop her getting
dialog: killed. I don't remember it all
dialog: but I remember. I was a baby. I
dialog: couldn't do anything. I couldn't
dialog: stop it. Cause I was a baby.
text: Cid is crying. Joe has never been more at a loss.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm sorry
text: Takes the buzzers. Stands, fumbling. Retreating.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: You should talk to your mom about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: She's not my mom. She's a liar.

scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS STREET - NIGHT
text: Old Joe. Running hard. Sirens, flashlights behind him.
dialog: Being chased.
text: Zig zags through an alleyway, a pursuing car smashing up

text: Bursts out onto the street, nearly hit by another car.
text: Shouts all around, a few shots. Surrounding. He runs.

scene_heading: INT/EXT. HALF BUILT HIGHRISE
text: Kid Blue, squatting in the 10th story of a half finished

text: And now his eyes are alight. He bolts for the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS STREETS - NIGHT
text: A small park on one block. With a playground. Swings, and a

text: After they pass, Old Joe's face pops up under the merry-go-
text: round. He crouches in a shallow space beneath it.
text: He sees: Across from the park, a cheap APARTMENT BUILDING.
text: He checks his map - the 2nd circled address. Kid number two.
text: He waits.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - EARLY MORNING
text: Sara chops the dead tree trunk in the field, greatly
text: diminished but still formidable. Joe approaches.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Can't you pull that out with a
dialog: plow?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Uh huh.
text: She keeps chopping.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I found a, in the barn I found some
dialog: parts, and I made a, thing.
text: Joe pushes one of Cid's BUZZERS into her hands, which we now
text: see is a colorful plastic frog toy with a light bulb nose.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: If you see anything, just push
dialog: that, and,
text: Joe pushes the button on his buzzer, and Sara's lights up and
text: vibrates. She regards the toy, then stares hard and cold at
dialog: Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's important.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Last night. He woke me up. Don't
dialog: tell him I told you though, he...
text: Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Starts chopping again. Joe
text: doesn't leave.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You said you were his mom.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He told me you're not.
text: This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: He said that?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: If he's not your son who is he?
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: (SHARP)
dialog: He's my son.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I had Cid when I was twenty two.
dialog: But I didn't want to give up my
text: life. In the city.
text: The word âcityâ has weight for her. Implies volumes.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: So I dropped Cid with my mom, here.
dialog: And my sister. And they saw how I
dialog: was living and they took him. My
dialog: sister raised him here, she loved
dialog: him. He called her mom.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How'd she get killed?
text: When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Cid told me. You have to talk to
dialog: him about it.
text: Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I told you one thing, I told you to
dialog: stay away from my son.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He asked about my gun. You think
dialog: this is going to go away if you
dialog: don't talk to him about it but it's
dialog: just gonna grow
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Stay out of it. Stay the fuck away
dialog: from my son.

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING
text: Sara sits with coffee, looking out at the fields. Deep in
dialog: thought.
text: She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette.
scene_heading: EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING
text: A motel style building. Gat Men in cars pass occasionally
text: with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed.
text: Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the
text: address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205.
text: Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just
text: at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot.
text: Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath.
text: The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping
text: exhausted, up the stairs.
text: And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by.
text: It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face,
text: pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be.
text: He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the
text: apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing.
text: Towards apartment 205.
dialog: Jesus it can't be.
text: Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes,
dialog: relieved.
text: She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely
text: indistinct conversation between her and the girl that
dialog: answers.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Sorry, I know I promised five, you
dialog: know how it gets.
speaker_heading: GIRL NEIGHBOR
dialog: Don't worry sugar. She was no
dialog: problem. Gat men searched through
dialog: here, lookin for god knows...
text: Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a
text: sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the
text: neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
text: Old Joe, frozen. Gun in his hand. Face numbly: âYou have to
dialog: be shitting me.â
text: He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205.
text: Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window.
text: On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap.
text: Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long

text: Old Joe watches them for a long time.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT PORCH - DAY

text: Sara is distracted by a distant bell-like DINGING.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Cid. 32.
text: She goes to the window, looks out, nervous.
text: But it's just a loose LAUNDRY LINE down in the yard, whipping
text: in the wind against its metal pole. In the distance, Joe
text: paces the yard.
text: Relieved, Sara returns to Cid. He sets the tile, petulant.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: No. Eight times three is what?
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: Thirty two.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Eight times three is what?
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: Thirty two.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I want you to count three eights.
speaker_heading: CID
text: Eight. Sixteen. Thirty two.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Are you telling me you want alone
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Okay. Why don't you put that where
dialog: it belongs?
text: Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back
text: down on the same spot.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Alone time.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
text: Then like a knife in a fist fight:
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: He's protecting us cause you can't
dialog: do it.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Ok. I told you to stay away from
speaker_heading: HIM
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: I never did anything
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Do you think I'm stupid?
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I told you already
text: Cid is building into a temper tantrum fast.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You do what I tell you
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: You can't tell me what to do you're
dialog: not my mom.
dialog: (a deadly beat)
dialog: You're not my mom! You're a liar
dialog: and you're gonna get killed and you
dialog: won't stop lying!
text: Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back.
text: Not hard, but Cid scoots back, eyes furious.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: CID BABY
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: You're a liar! Liar! I hate you
dialog: because you're lying! I hate you!
dialog: Liar! You're lying to me!
text: Sara scoots back.
speaker_heading: SARA
speaker_heading: CID
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: You're lying!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
text: Cid stands, balls his fists, SCREAMING at her. Sara pushes
text: back away from him.
text: Maybe a cloud passed over the sun. The room darkens.
text: And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid. She bolts
text: out of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
text: Sara walks fast down the hall
scene_heading: INT. SARA'S BEDROOM
text: Not slowing, through her bedroom
scene_heading: INT. SARA'S CLOSET
text: Into her walk-in closet, to a huge steel safe tucked in back.
text: She opens the safe with trembling hands. And climbs inside.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE
text: Closes the heavy door. Turns on a small LED light.
text: And waits. Cid's screams distant but not lessening.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
text: Cid's screams from the house, clear as day.
text: Joe paces in front of the barn. Turns his head back towards
text: the house, not sure what to think.
text: The screams stop. Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying
dialog: corn.
scene_heading: INT. CID'S BEDROOM
text: The math game scattered, numbered tiles everywhere. Cid lies
text: face down on the bed, cried out.
text: Sara enters quietly. Sits on the bed beside him. Strokes
text: his hair. He folds into her, and they're holding each other
dialog: tight.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
text: A Gat Man named CANADY strolls out of a donut shop, coffee in
text: hand, and gets in his car.
scene_heading: INT. CANADY'S CAR
text: Canady starts the car up, starts driving.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
text: Somehow not seeing Kid Blue crouched clear as day in the
text: passenger side foot-well.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: Hey Can. Can.
text: Canady sees him, jumps and yelps.
text: The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car.
dialog: Coffee everywhere.
speaker_heading: CANADY
dialog: Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the
speaker_heading: FUCK
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: Pull into that alley.
speaker_heading: CANADY
dialog: You get the fuck outta
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: You don't wanna be seen with me
text: Canady, pull in the alley.
text: Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley,
dialog: parks it.
speaker_heading: CANADY
dialog: The fuck are you still doing in
dialog: town, Abe wants you dead man
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: All Abe wants right now is the
dialog: looper. Unless he got him last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: CANADY
dialog: Jssshhh. No we didn't get him.
text: Spotted and lost him. West End,
text: near Whore's Alley.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: Whore's Alley?
speaker_heading: CANADY
dialog: That area, Mott &amp; Talbott, little
dialog: working girl colony.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: (has a thought)
dialog: Whore's Alley..
speaker_heading: CANADY
dialog: You shoulda left town man.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: I'm gonna bring him in, get right
dialog: with Abe.
speaker_heading: CANADY
dialog: Yeah, maybe you bring him the
dialog: looper, but short of that Abe don't
dialog: get right with priced men.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: I got a price?
speaker_heading: CANADY
dialog: Big one.
text: Canady locks the car doors.
text: And in that one moment, Kid Blue pulls Canady's gun from his
text: holster. Holds it on him. A tense moment.
speaker_heading: CANADY (CONT'D)
dialog: Course I'd never turn a friend for
speaker_heading: A PRICE
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY
text: BANG and the drivers side window explodes outward bloody.
text: A moment, then Kid Blue stumbles out, holding his ears in
text: pain. Off down the alley and out of sight.
scene_heading: INT. CID'S BEDROOM
text: Sara lies with Cid, both asleep.
text: Distant but sharp, a bell ringing. It's unmistakable this
text: time. The DINNER BELL. Sara's eyelids flutter. She hears.
dialog: Stiffens.
text: The bell stops suddenly. She stands, careful not to wake
dialog: Cid.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS
text: Sara rushes quietly down the stairs.
text: Through a doorway, she sees the Frog Buzzer sitting on the
text: living room coffee table. Lit up and buzzing.
text: She goes to the front door, throws it open. And is face to
text: face with a tall Gat Man named JESSE. She freezes.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Evenin ma'am.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Evenin. How can I help you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
text: Joe is nowhere in sight.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You can start by accepting my
dialog: apologies re the hour, I hope I
dialog: didn't catch you in supper.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No, that's fine.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Yours was the last house on my list
dialog: today, been walking between empty
text: farms all day in the hot sun.
dialog: Thought I'd tick this off my list,
dialog: not have to come back tomorrow.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What's this about?
text: Back in the house somewhere, a screen door bangs.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You alone here, ma'am?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: My husband should be back from the
dialog: city, any time now.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Happy to hear. Could I trouble you
dialog: for some water?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Course. I'll get some, you can
dialog: take the glass with you.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Actually ma'am, my business
dialog: tonight, this ticking off the list
dialog: business, it's gonna require me
dialog: coming in. If that's alright.
text: Jesse shifts his weight, and Sara notices his heavy boot is
text: now a few inches over the door jam.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Will you tell me what this is
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: I will, yes. Can I come in?
text: Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun.
text: Possibilities whirling through her mind.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ma'am?
text: Silent decision, and she steps aside to let him enter.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Joe slips in through the screen door, gun in hand. Freezes
text: in the kitchen, listening.
speaker_heading: JESSE (O.S.)
dialog: I'm a deputized police officer,
dialog: we're looking for an escaped
text: criminal, just doing a sweep. Seen
dialog: anyone through here the past two
dialog: days, vagrants?
speaker_heading: SARA (O.S.)
dialog: No, vagrants are always passing but
text: nobody near the house.
text: Footsteps, as they walk deeper in the house. Joe can't tell
text: if they're coming through the living room or hall. He
dialog: hesitates.
speaker_heading: JESSE (O.S.)
dialog: This man, here.
speaker_heading: SARA (O.S.)
dialog: He's young. No.
text: Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as
text: they enter from the living room.
text: Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe. She pours
text: him some water. Jesse hands her a second photograph.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: We're looking for his father too,
dialog: similar look and build but late
dialog: 50s. May or may not be travelling
dialog: together.
text: This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega,
text: of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk.
text: Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with
dialog: Joe's. Mind spinning. Maybe making the connection, we're
dialog: not sure.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No.
text: She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take
text: them. He notices the toys on the table.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Keep em. Kids with your husband?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Yeah. Just one.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: How old?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Eight.
text: Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe
text: slipping through the hall and into the living room.
text: He lifts his glass, drinks.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'll show you round the grounds,
dialog: then the house, then you can be on
dialog: your way.
text: Sara holds the screen door open for him.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: We'll start with the house.
text: Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM
text: He sits on a couch, taps on a small folding phone. Sara
text: follows him.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Eight, you said? Boy? And your
dialog: husband. Just gotta, check in.
dialog: With the home office. This goddamn
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: This man dangerous?
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Tween you me and a lamppost? No.
dialog: Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My
dialog: boss has half the city's looking
dialog: for him. Half the city and me.
dialog: So. And if you find him, there's a
dialog: helluva price. Think on that if he
text: comes by, acting sweet.
text: Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees
text: Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
text: If Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day.
text: Joe motions for Cid to get out. Cid points to Jesse, makes a
text: GUN with his hand. Asking Joe.
text: Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out! Cid silently
text: creeps down the stairs.
text: He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't
text: look up from his phone.
text: Cid vanishes down the hall. Jesse looks up, stands.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, show me upstairs.
text: The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs. Jesse looks
text: sharply at Sara.
speaker_heading: SARA
text: Drafts, in the house.
text: Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant
text: Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway.
text: Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe.
speaker_heading: JESSE (O.S.)
dialog: This door doesn't latch?
speaker_heading: SARA (O.S.)
dialog: It used to, it's busted.
text: Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER
text: Cid follows him in, down steep concrete stairs. Pulls the
text: door closed behind them. It CREAKS. Jesse steps out into
text: the hallway, gun drawn. Sara behind him.
speaker_heading: JESSE
text: Drafty house.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Farm house.
text: Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it.
text: CREAK. He looks at Sara.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What's down there?
speaker_heading: SARA
text: Laundry room. Door must've blown
dialog: open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
text: Jesse opens the door, then looks at Sara gravely.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Two things. First, I have a family
dialog: of my own back in the city, and I
dialog: want to see them again. Second if
dialog: anything happens to me, and I don't
dialog: report back to my boss people in
dialog: fifteen minutes, they're gonna know
dialog: I disappeared searching this house,
dialog: and inside of another fifteen
dialog: you'll have an army of more me's
dialog: kicking down your door. Ok?
speaker_heading: SARA
text: It's a laundry room.
text: Jesse motions - her first.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM
text: Bare concrete basement, starkly lit by a hanging bulb. The
text: only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer, and
text: a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge.
text: No windows. Nowhere else to go. Jesse levels his gun at the
dialog: hamper.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: You want to call out whoever's
dialog: hiding in that hamper?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: If someone was hiding in the house,
dialog: that's what I'd do. But nobody is
dialog: in the house. Open it up.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: No I think I'm gonna put a shot
dialog: through it just to be safe.
text: He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly.
speaker_heading: JESSE (CONT'D)
dialog: You wanna call him out?
text: Sara stays silent. A long beat.
text: Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty.
text: She throws open the washer and dryer. She takes the bucket
text: and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's
text: empty.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Now if you promise not to wag your
dialog: gun at my shoe rack I'll show you
dialog: upstairs then show you the fuck
dialog: out.
text: She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his
text: gun and follows her.
text: The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the
text: room, and into a drain hole under the hamper.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL
text: Dark and earthy. Cid leads Joe with his flashlight.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Just outside the barn, a trap door covered with earth opens
text: two inches. Joe and Cid prop it open, and peer out at the
dialog: house.
scene_heading: INT. CRAWL SPACE - CONTINUOUS
text: A deep large hole capped with a wooden trap door. Joe
text: squats, Cid stands.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: My granddad built it, but he didn't
dialog: tell anyone of us why. Nanna said
dialog: cuz he was nuts.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thank you granddad.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: That wasn't the man.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No. I know him, that's what's
dialog: funny. His name's Jesse. I like
dialog: him. He'll go away when he doesn't
dialog: find me, he won't hurt her.
text: They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse
text: leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking
text: back towards the highway.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: My mom gave me up. I was younger
dialog: than you. We were vagrants, and
dialog: she was alone, for a long time I
dialog: thought she was stupid for getting
dialog: on the drug she was on, it was bad
dialog: stuff, it probably ended up killing
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: But now I see, she was so alone.
dialog: And it was what she had. She sold
dialog: me. To a panhandle gang.
text: QUICKLY, SILENTLY WE SEE - FOUR YEAR OLD JOE dragged into
text: darkness by rough men, screaming. Then we're back to the
dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: But I got away. And I ran and I
text: ended on a train, sitting in the
text: dark in an empty freight, going to
dialog: the city, and I saw myself over and
dialog: over killing those men who bought
dialog: me and who got my mom on what she
text: was on. Finding them and tearing
dialog: them apart. Saving my mom.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: But you didn't.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A man in the city found me, put a
dialog: gun in my hand, and gave me some
dialog: things. I didn't have my mom
dialog: anymore. I had my work, my money.
dialog: My plans. For my life. That's
dialog: what I'd kill for. Not something I
dialog: don't have, and can't ever get
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: There's just men figuring out what
dialog: they'd do to keep what's theirs,
dialog: what they got. That's the only
dialog: kind of man there is.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: I'm not gonna let Sara get killed.
text: Joe looks at him. Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but
dialog: doesn't.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I think we're clear.
text: He opens the trap door, climbs out.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN
text: Joe reaches down to help Cid out. Looking down at Cid in a
text: hole with a trap door. Like Seth.
text: He grabs Cid's hand and lifts him out.
text: Sara comes out, sees Cid and her face breaks with relief.
text: Cid runs to her, and in the distance they embrace.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
text: Sara and Joe share a look. Joe quickly turns his eyes back
dialog: to the corn fields.
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY MONITOR ROOM - EVENING
text: A tiny, dark concrete room. Kid Blue watches a screen, his
text: hand on a toggle wheel. A security cam view of Suzie's
text: apartment building upper landing. Playback of last night.
text: It scans quickly forward.
text: The APARTMENT SUPER leans against the wall behind him,
dialog: counting money.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: All working girls, yeah?
speaker_heading: SUPER
dialog: Uh huh. This whole block. You
dialog: wanna check those too, I can
dialog: arrange.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: I do.
text: On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from
text: next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an
text: instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the
dialog: playback.
speaker_heading: KID BLUE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: âLo Joe.
text: Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches
text: Suzie through the window for a long while. Kid watches him
dialog: intently.
text: Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves.
text: Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket.
speaker_heading: SUPER
dialog: I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha.
dialog: But you don't see what you wanna
dialog: see, no refunds.
text: Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels.
scene_heading: EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING
text: Kid Blue emerges from a passage, into the parking lot. Looks
text: up at Suzie's apartment door. Then down the street. A few
text: drops of rain fall.
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH CAR - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Driving on a highway along the beach. A few drops of rain on
text: the windshield. Old Joe (late 40s) and his Wife in intense
text: conversation, her hand on his.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
dialog: But I will.
speaker_heading: WIFE (IN FRENCH)
dialog: You want to, I know that. But you
dialog: won't.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
dialog: I'd do anything for you.
speaker_heading: WIFE (IN FRENCH)
dialog: You'd do. You'd kill for me, you'd
dialog: take life for me. But I don't want
dialog: that. You kill for what you love,
dialog: but someone loves the person you
dialog: kill, and it starts again. I don't
dialog: want that. I can't love a killer.
dialog: What would you give up for me?
dialog: That's yours?
speaker_heading: OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)
dialog: Anything.
text: She smiles but does not believe him. Old Joe sees this. A
text: moment, in thought.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The car screeches to a stop, and Old Joe runs to the sea.
text: THROWS his gun in the ocean. Above the waters, the sun
text: breaks the clouds. Rain falls.
text: He runs back to her. Falls on her. Kissing her. He holds
text: her face like the most precious thing in the world.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Anything.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - EVENING
text: Rain beats against stained glass. Old Joe kneeling in a pew.
text: Fists clenched as if in prayer. He stands, stumbles out.
scene_heading: EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE - EVENING
text: Oddly quiet. Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the
text: side entrance to the theater. Face uncovered. In plain
text: sight. Not caring. Stops 30 feet shy of the entrance, at a
text: street garbage can.
text: He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can. He
text: lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can.
text: His pocket watch, hanging open from its chain. The picture
text: of his Wife inside. Spinning. His gun slowly slipping from
text: his grasp.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
text: With each spin of the watch, the photo of his Wife appears
text: cloudier. Blurred. Indistinct.
text: Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall. Then the
text: photo is nearly gone.
scene_heading: OLD JOE'S EYES.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: Old Joe staggering to his feet from a fight.
dialog: We've seen this before, it's the IDENTICAL SCENE to the
dialog: previous flashback.
text: But when he sees his Wife for the first time, whisps of FOG
text: grow, blotting out the scene. Deep in the fog are other
text: backgrounds - a street, a house - and unfamiliar faces.
text: Other eventualities, clouding this one as it becomes less
dialog: likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory.
dialog: Erasing it.
scene_heading: OLD JOE'S EYES.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Old Joe in bed with his wife. Baby crying outside. Her
text: face. Then, whisps of FOG thickens, obscuring them.
scene_heading: OLD JOE'S EYES.
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH BEACH - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: The thrown gun splashes in the sea, and Old Joe turns back to
dialog: the beach. But where his Wife was in the previous memory,
dialog: now there is the FOG.
text: A wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky. Old Joe dwarfed
text: against it. Caught between the roiling waves and this wall of
text: nothingness falling towards him.
scene_heading: OLD JOE'S EYES.
text: The gun on his fingertips. About to fall. A moment of
dialog: decision.
scene_heading: INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Sara lies in bed. Eyes wide open. Still and quiet in the
text: dark. Her hand moves over her bare leg. Slides across the
text: sheets. Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her.
text: A moment of hesitation. Then she pushes it.
text: Silence. Her eyes go to the window. A long beat. Then
text: sound: a door opening in the house below.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
text: Quick footsteps approaching. Her eyes follow them. The door
text: flies open. Joe, gun in hand, buzzer in the other. His eyes
dialog: adjust to the dark.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What?
text: Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head
dialog: doesn't know where to go.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Don't wake Cid.
text: She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain
text: starts to fall against the windows.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned.
text: Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She
text: sets the lighter on her palm. It floats about a foot in the
text: air, spinning, then drops.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's pretty good.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: In the city, young guys would hit
dialog: on me by floating fucking quarters,
dialog: I wouldn't tell âem I was TK but
dialog: I'd keep their quarters down. One
text: guy busted a blood vessel in his
text: eye trying to get it up.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: He's you. Your loop. You lied to
dialog: me.
text: She doesn't seem angry but deeply curious. Joe sits up.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: But you protected Cid. And I know
dialog: you're not lying that you're gonna
dialog: kill this guy, your own self. Even
dialog: though he's protecting your future.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He's protecting his future. Not
dialog: mine.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: When I came back, after my sister
text: died. Cid was sitting on the
dialog: porch, I remember seeing him for
dialog: the first time, in two years.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
text: Saw him on the porch. I drove up
dialog: crying and I had been at a party in
dialog: the city when I got the call, I was
dialog: wearing this ridiculous party
dialog: dress. All my ridiculous shit. I
dialog: don't know if he remembered me, but
text: he looked at me. I abandoned him.
dialog: I abandoned my baby.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Maybe I can't be a mother to him,

scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM
text: The room darkens. As if the sun passed behind a cloud.
text: Jesse realizes it's a kid. Lowers his gun. But Cid is mid-
text: scream, falling back, his foot misses the step and he tumbles
text: down the stairs.
text: Confused, terrified, falling. Joe runs into the foyer, to
text: catch Cid. Sara runs behind him.
text: The room is very dark now. Knick-knacks around the room

text: Spinning. Sara's LIGHTER, on the coffee table: it RISES

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT 205

scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (NORMAL)

speaker_heading: JOE (O.S.)
dialog: Cid!
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE

speaker_heading: SARA

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How did your sister die?

scene_heading: INT. SMALL CROP CLEARING
text: Joe emerges from the corn.
text: Cid crouches at one end of the small clearing. He looks at
text: Joe. Terrified. Half covered in blood. Hair matted over
text: one eye.
text: Joe looks back at him. Approaches him, gun not raised, but
text: in hand. Cid, like a frightened animal. A long moment.
text: And just like that, Joe puts his hand on Cid's head. Cid
text: leans against his legs, crying.
text: Sara bursts into the clearing, sees this. Runs to Cid and
text: embraces him, wiping the blood from his face. Joe steps back.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Right now two things have happened.
dialog: My looper knows Cid's the kid he's

speaker_heading: SARA

speaker_heading: KID BLUE (ON SPEAKER)

scene_heading: INT. COAT CHECK
text: The door buzzes open. Kid pushes Old Joe through the long

text: shocked amazement.
text: Old Joe's hands bound back. Kid Blue glows. He comes to the
text: tiny coat check room, and Big Craig stops him, then sees Old
dialog: Joe.
speaker_heading: BIG CRAIG
dialog: Hoh. So both we got?
speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: Just the Looper. I got him. Knew
dialog: he went for whores, so I checked
dialog: every building.
speaker_heading: BIG CRAIG
dialog: They found Joe too though, in a

speaker_heading: KID BLUE
dialog: Joe fuck Joe, save your bullets I

dialog: This happens very fast:
text: Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back
text: into Kid Blue, SLAMMING him against the opposite wall.
text: Old Joe grabs (behind his back) Kid Blue's gun, and blasts
text: one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the
text: Kid's midsection.
text: He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in
text: the face. Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway
text: while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic
dialog: rifle.
text: He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but
text: mostly the men are trapped. Then it's over. All is smoky
text: still for a moment.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
text: Old Joe stares at the exit door ajar, down the long hallway
text: jammed with bodies. Then at the passage that leads deeper
text: into the club.
text: A Gat Man runs in, and Old Joe shoots him down.
text: He steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns
text: and grenades. Then launches himself into passageway towards
dialog: the club.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE
text: Old Joe weaves his way through the backstage area, chucking
text: grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle
text: into the smoky aftermath.
text: And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being
text: gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man.
text: The corridors are tight, twisty. Old Joe uses that.
text: Throwing grenades. Blasting away. Purging. Killing
text: everyone he lays eyes on. Wiping them out. All the bad guys.
text: It's horrible. Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way
text: people actually die from gunshots. Old Joe forges on, deeper.
scene_heading: INT. ABE'S OFFICE
text: Empty. Old Joe kicks the door open. Takes it in, the
text: office. Hammer on the desk. He reloads a gun. Eyes find
text: the door to Abe's inner den.
scene_heading: INT. ABE'S DEN
text: Abe and two Gat Men, guns out, crouched behind the table.
text: Watching the door. A display screen shows Old Joe on the
dialog: other side.
text: Abe, eyes dull. Shouts at the door
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Joe. Guess I put the gun in that
dialog: kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess
text: everything comes back around. Like
dialog: your goddamn ties.
scene_heading: INT. ABE'S OFFICE
text: Old Joe. Breathing hard. Reloaded. Closes the gun.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY
text: Joe breaks out of the corn, panting. He steps out into the

text: Storm clouds on the horizon. He cleans and readies his
dialog: Blunderbuss.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
scene_heading: INT. COAT CHECK - LATER
text: Kid Blue's eyes flutter open. He lifts himself painfully.
text: Checks his chest. Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his
text: chest is grazed.
text: The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE
text: Kid Blue wanders the smoky halls. Dead and dying men.
scene_heading: INT. ABE'S DEN
text: Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest. Kid Blue
text: stands over them. Stunned. Tears well in his eyes.
text: Then on the wall, he sees the map. The farm circled in red.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING
text: Clothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck. Sara
text: loads one last bundle. Calls to Cid, in the front seat.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Ok baby, we're going.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY
text: Joe waits. Then, a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway. He
text: tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored
dialog: truck.
text: Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his
text: gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in.
text: The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He
text: throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Bon jour. You take this truck, you
dialog: take your money, and you go live
dialog: your life. No one's coming after
dialog: you. I fixed it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And you go kill the boy. That's
dialog: how you fix it.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: That's how. You got your life
dialog: back, you better think right now
dialog: about what that's worth to you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: My life? Your life. Becoming you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
text: Joe raises his Blunderbuss and FIRES. Too far away, the shot
text: scatters. The old man flinches, backs away.
text: Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold.
speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Stupid little shit! You let him
dialog: live, he's gonna take away
dialog: everything that's yours, everything
dialog: that's mine! You seen what the
dialog: boy's gonna become.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I haven't seen that yet.
text: Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's
text: chest and knock him back.
text: Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has
text: until now blocked our line of sight down the highway.
dialog: Kid Blue.
text: The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to
text: the dusty pavement.
text: The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its
text: wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a
dialog: stop and spin it around.
text: Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss.
text: Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as
text: a rock.
text: Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires
text: scattershot.
text: Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe.
text: Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round
text: after fiery round.
text: Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud.
text: KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud
text: of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to
text: slow the bike but can't in time.
text: In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him.
text: He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly
text: FIRES his buss.
text: A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without
text: a driver. It skids, crashes.
text: When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
text: Besides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue.
text: Painfully, Joe raises himself. Then realizes:

scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN
text: Sara starts the truck up.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Here we go. Give it a wave
dialog: goodbye.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD
text: They roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway.
text: At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them,

text: Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it. Straight for him.
speaker_heading: CID
speaker_heading: STOP
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Duck down baby
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: Stop please he can shoot us
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Just stay down
text: Half the distance closed, but he's still far off. A shot
text: cracks the front grill, another cracks the windshield.
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: Stop!
text: The truck lurches horribly, and flips straight back in a
text: graceful arc, landing upsidown.
text: Sara and Cid, dazed, hanging by their seatbelts.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Are you ok?
speaker_heading: CID
dialog: I'm sorry

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You're ok. C'mon baby we have to

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
text: She unfastens them and they both climb out, and Old Joe stops
text: suddenly, taking aim.
text: Sara pulls Cid behind the flatbed for cover as two bullets
text: glance off the overturned truck.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going into the fields. I
dialog: want you to run, I'll be right
dialog: behind you, don't look back. Okay?

speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Go!
text: They both sprint off the road.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH CID &amp; SARA
text: The wide bare field. Cid runs ahead towards the corn, Sara
text: not far behind. The earth soft, their feet sink in, like a

scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE
text: Old Joe crosses the road and chases them onto the field,
text: firing at them on the run.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH CID &amp; SARA

text: turns, about thirty feet ahead of her.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE
text: Old Joe stops running and steadies his gun.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH CID &amp; SARA
text: A distant gunshot CRACK. A fan of crimson blood sprays from

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: NO!
text: Sara is stopped in her tracks by an invisible force.
speaker_heading: SARA (CONT'D)
dialog: No Cid no!
text: The topsoil of the earth around them RISES in a fine dust.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE

dialog: 
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH CID &amp; SARA
text: Sara struggles to reach Cid but is still about twenty feet
text: behind him.
text: Cid raises his head. The bullet grazed his jawline. Not
text: severe but lots of blood.
text: Cid's eyes locked hateful on Old Joe. Blood soaks his shirt.
text: Far behind him, the barn splinters apart as if in a tornado.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No!
text: With a sudden jolt the field ripples out from Cid, like a
text: stone thrown in a pond.
text: Sara lifts into the air.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE
text: Old Joe is hefted off the ground. His gun falls.
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELDS - CONTINUOUS

text: Something like a furious wind rushes through the stalks.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH CID &amp; SARA
text: Cid stands. Intense, eyes dark, in another place.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE
text: Old Joe, suspended mid-air, realizes what's about to happen.
text: He lifts his hand defensively and SCREAMS
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH CID &amp; SARA
text: Cid's face straining, about to scream.
text: Cid's focus adjusts from Old Joe to Sara. She floats,
text: reaching out to him. Frightened. Yelling something he can't
text: hear but he can see her eyes.
text: Cid's face breaks. He barely mouths the word
speaker_heading: CID
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes

scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF FIELD - CONTINUOUS
text: The corn stalks shiver then are still.

dialog: Too far.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH CID &amp; SARA
text: Cid runs to Sara, who sits up slowly. They embrace.
speaker_heading: SARA

speaker_heading: NO

speaker_heading: GO NOW
speaker_heading: CID

speaker_heading: SARA

speaker_heading: OLD JOE
dialog: Move!
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE
text: Still too far away, struggling as fast as he can, helpless as

scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE &amp; SARA
