dialog: What I can do for you ~ for Stone.
dialog: There’s a whole system...
speaker_heading: LUCETTA
dialog: Have you tried magnet therapy?
speaker_heading: LUCETTA (CONT‘D)
dialog: For your back. These magnets you
dialog: wear and stuff?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Magnets?
speaker_heading: LUCETTA
dialog: You should come over to the house

dialog: this guy sold me and I wear ‘em in
dialog: my shoes and I don’t get tired at
dialog: school or anything.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: LUCETTA
dialog: And then sometimes I put ‘em under
dialog: my pillow when I go to sleep.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah? What does that do?
speaker_heading: LUCETTA
dialog: Oh, you know we‘re all toxic. It‘s
dialog: all the microwaves and cell phones
dialog: going through the air, all that
dialog: stuff that we can’t see.
dialog: politely.
speaker_heading: LUCETTA (CONT‘D)
dialog: Things build up inside you. And it
dialog: makes you achy and upset and can

dialog: Wow. That’s...
speaker_heading: LUCETTA
dialog: It’s real. I believe in it. You
dialog: don’t believe it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don’t know, I guess.
speaker_heading: LUCETTA
dialog: It’s real. For me it’s all about
dialog: the body, you know? When your body
dialog: feels good, your head just follows.
dialog: Absolutely. Egg?
text: She offers the peeled egg. He hesitates.
speaker_heading: LUCETTA (CONT‘D)
dialog: My kids did ‘em. Now I’m stuck with

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (smiles a little)
dialog: Salt and pepper. They're nice.
text: She sprinkles some of each on top and then gently blows the

speaker_heading: LUCETTA
dialog: Well don't be shy, just eat the
dialog: whole thing.
text: He pops the whole thing in his mouth and pretends to swallow,
text: holding it in his cheek. She gasps and then he brings it
