dialog: Today is the first party of the rest of your life. That's
text: how this HIP HOP CROWD is dancing. Like the future is

text: Suddenly, “Hypnotize” by Biggie Smalls ERUPTS THROUGH THE

text: another level. There are no societal shackles or chains
dialog: here. Free at last. Free at last. Thank God and hip hop,

text: Christopher looks out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - NIGHT
text: A BLACK CHEVY IMPALA pulls up alongside him, cradling a MAN
text: whose face we do not see. A NINE MILLIMETER sticks out the

text: ECHOES LIKE A HOWL.
text: The EMPTY SHELL CASINGS fall to the ground in SLOW MOTION,
text: hitting the pavement with quiet PINGS. SCREAMS AND
text: PANDEMONIUM ENSUE. The SQUEAL OF TIRES as the Impala escapes
text: away into the night. Christopher's head TILTS TOWARD CAMERA,
text: lifeless. SUDDEN SILENCE. Then A SOULFUL GOSPEL SONG BREAKS
dialog: THROUGH. “I_want Jesus to walk with me. I want Jesus to
dialog: walk with me...”
scene_heading: INT. FRANK E. CAMPBELL FUNERAL CHAPEL - DAY
text: A twenty-four-year-old SISTER sings. It is her voice we are

dialog: breaking, I want Jesus to walk with me.”
text: Christopher Wallace lays in a casket sporting a white suit

text: The chapel is JAM PACKED. A fire hazard. MARY J. BLIGE,
scene_heading: HEAVY D, BUSTA RHYMES, MAYOR DAVID DINKINS, Puffy AND

text: VOLETTA WALLACE, regal, late forties, walks to the podium.
text: Her eyes are the only dry ones in the house. She is simply

speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: For there is hope of a tree, if it

speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: I happen to like this music.

speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: Try me.
text: He sits back down and the contest is on. Christopher and

text: Voletta bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Yes! Yes!
speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: Okay, okay. But that still gives
dialog: you no right to insult my music.
text: Christopher continues to devour his food.
speaker_heading: VOLETTA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: VOLETTA (V.0O.)
dialog: I wanted to make sure he’d have the

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Shit. My dumb ass just walked into

speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: Pretty much.

speaker_heading: JAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

dialog: All right... all right. Fuck it.
speaker_heading: JAN
dialog: “All right, fuck it?”
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

speaker_heading: DAMIEN
dialog: That’s just how people look. If
text: they were walking around grinning
dialog: from ear to ear, you’d think they
dialog: were crazy.
dialog: Then --
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: Ah, hell no!
text: Chico suddenly notices Sandy, the pregnant woman standing

speaker_heading: CHICO (CONT'D)
dialog: You believe this shit?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Yo, I got it.
text: Christopher walks across the street. He and Sandy talk.

text: plugs something into a boom box. It is a microphone.
text: A TRACK PLAYS and Ralston FIRES OFF A RAP, bragging about
text: being Bed-Stuy’s reigning champ. Then he cuts down
text: Christopher. He says he is whack, fat, etc. It is a verbal
text: assault and some in the crowd laugh with delight. THEN
text: CHRISTOPHER TAKES THE MICROPHONE.
text: There is a light inside of Christopher, often too discarded
text: to shine. However, the high beams are on right now. Using
text: the emcee moniker, CWEST, Christopher BEGINS RAPPING.
text: Verbally, he throws a jab, right-hook and obliterates
dialog: Ralston. To call this a beat down would be an
dialog: understatement.
dialog: Bed-Stuy has just witnessed the confirmation of the

speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: Twenty days.

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: You haven’t gone to school for

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: All right, look. I tried, Ma.
speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: What hell do you mean, “tried?”
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: I went back for three weeks

speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: In the real world you need an

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: So I could end up like everyone

speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: How the hell do you know how people
dialog: are living?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: I know three people came to my
dialog: class on career day. Some computer
text: technician. A store owner. Even a
dialog: doctor. And all of them looked
text: like poor, broke-down niggas.
speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: Watch your mouth!
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Fine. All of them looked like
dialog: broke-down “individuals.” Maybe if
dialog: we lived next door to Donald Trump
dialog: or Bill Cosby, it would be
dialog: different. But I can’t see myself
dialog: sitting in no school to end up like
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: Then you'll end up a bum. Boy,
dialog: don’t you have enough sense to see
dialog: that?
text: Christopher pulls the jewelry out of his pockets.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: I have enough sense to see bums
dialog: don't have chains. Bums don’t have
dialog: rings.
text: He pulls out a wad of cash.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER (CONT'D)
dialog: And “boys” don’t have money.
text: Voletta looks at the wad of money, shaken.
speaker_heading: VOLETTA
dialog: You want to end up dead or in jail?
dialog: Is that what you’re trying to do in
dialog: those streets? Get the hell out!
text: She pushes him.
speaker_heading: VOLETTA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a disgrace.
text: Christopher is stung by that.
speaker_heading: VOLETTA (CONT'D)
dialog: I said get out!
scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Christopher walks out of the building, carrying duffle bags
text: and a suitcase. From above, Voletta watches him through the

speaker_heading: DAMIEN (V.O.)

speaker_heading: DAMIEN (V.0.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BIGGIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: But?
speaker_heading: BIGGIE
dialog: But you gotta put more Bed-Stuy in

scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT
text: As they round the corner, Damien pulls an ounce of weed out

text: places it on the table in front of them.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: GARCIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Ain’t like when I was a kid. No
dialog: Sir. If you had a switchblade or

dialog: dude. People knew to leave you
dialog: alone. Now, we got thirteen-year-
dialog: olds just waiting to cancel the big
text: niggers on the corner so they could
dialog: start running shit themselves. I
dialog: mean, what the fuck is the world
dialog: coming to when a drug dealer can't

dialog: Tell me Chris, what do you put on
dialog: first? Your socks, your jacket, or

speaker_heading: BIGGIE
dialog: I ain’t never seen that gun before.
speaker_heading: GARCIA
dialog: Really? So then it must be yours,

speaker_heading: DAMIEN
dialog: Nah.
text: Garcia chuckles.
speaker_heading: GARCIA
dialog: Okay, you dumbfucks. Let me tell

dialog: Which one, I don’t give a shit.
dialog: But no way both of you

speaker_heading: DAMIEN

speaker_heading: BIGGIE
dialog: My gun. My bid.
speaker_heading: DAMIEN
dialog: Listen to me. What you got going
dialog: on, don’t come around every fucking
dialog: day. When a motherfucka like you
dialog: makes it, we all make it. You feel
dialog: me? You’re not going back out on
dialog: the corner, Big. Not when you got
dialog: a chance to do something. And not
dialog: with me taking this bid for you.
text: Biggie is at a loss for words. Garcia comes back in.
speaker_heading: GARCIA
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: DAMIEN
dialog: Socks.
speaker_heading: GARCIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAMIEN
dialog: I put my socks on first.

speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Biggie would never admit to it, but
dialog: for the first time, before going

scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: A RAP GROUP is on stage as Biggie nervously peers out at the

dialog: 47.
scene_heading: INT. THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: From Biggie’s POV, THE CROWD LOOKS EVEN BIGGER FROM THE

text: he can muster. He rocks Timb’s, jeans and a loose-fitting
text: shirt. Basically, he’s dressed the same way he dressed on
dialog: the corner. Cease and Money L (the guy from the local Bed-
text: Stuy parties), walk out with him. They are his hype-men,

scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE ~ NIGHT

speaker_heading: TUPAC (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TUPAC
dialog: Outlawz, motherfucka!

speaker_heading: BIGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I had this friend, know what I’m

dialog: won't believe me. Maybe nobody
dialog: will. But frankly, at this point,

dialog: I think it was something all of us

dialog: “Who shot ya? Separate the weak
dialog: from the obsolete. Hard to creep

speaker_heading: BIGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: “Slip and break the eleventh

text: who ratted on him and the record store where he battled
dialog: Ralston, the sucka M.C.
speaker_heading: DAMIEN
dialog: I talked to Mark today.
speaker_heading: BIGGIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DAMIEN
dialog: He’s worried about you. Wants me
dialog: to convince you to go back into the
dialog: studio.
text: Cease chimes in.
speaker_heading: CEASE
dialog: It's been two years since “Ready to

speaker_heading: BIGGIE

dialog: Cease, busted --
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CEASE

speaker_heading: BIGGIE

speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: They should have told him you would
dialog: get back into the studio when
dialog: you’re good and fucking ready.
dialog: ‘Cause no one could talk your hard-
dialog: headed ass into anything anyway.
text: They all laugh. Then as they pull up to a red light,
text: SOMETHING OUTSIDE CATCHES BIGGIE’S ATTENTION.
speaker_heading: CEASE
text: Later for the studio. Big Chris is
dialog: thinking about starting a clothing
dialog: company. And a restaurant, right?
text: Biggie nods but his attention is drawn elsewhere.
speaker_heading: DAMIEN
dialog: A restaurant would be hot. But I
dialog: want to be the motherfucka who’s
text: interviewing the waitresses.
dialog: As the guys joke about the waitress qualifications --
text: The person who Biggie is staring at comes into frame. IT IS
text: SANDY, THE ONCE PREGNANT CRACKHEAD WHO BIGGIE SOLD DRUGS TO.
text: She seems to have gotten herself together. She is dressed
text: nice and even more amazing, she holds the hand of a FIVE-YEAR-
text: OLD BOY who looks just like her.
text: Biggie is mesmerized and his heart is pounding...
scene_heading: INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT - DAY
text: With the use of a cane, Biggie walks to the dinner table.
text: Crowded around the table are Biggie, Cease, Damien and Chico.
text: Miss Wallace places food on the table and sits with them.
text: Voletta closes her eyes and bows her head. The guys look at
text: each other, taking the cue. They take off their caps and all
text: bow their heads.
dialog: Biggie says the grace.
speaker_heading: BIGGIE
dialog: (heartfelt)
dialog: Dear God... thank you.
dialog: 113.
text: Then Biggie looks up but everyone’s head remains bowed.
text: Finally, Cease peeks, then Damien, then Chico.
speaker_heading: DAMIEN
dialog: That’s all?
text: Chico starts to laugh.
speaker_heading: CHICO
dialog: Damn man. At least drop God is
dialog: good, God is great.
text: His boys start cracking the hell up. But Voletta gets it.
speaker_heading: VOLETTA

scene_heading: INT. NEW JERSEY HOME - DAY

text: Puffy and Biggie splash through the water in a speedboat as a

text: ASSAILANTS from black helicopters shoot at them and they are
text: trying to evade them as Biggie and Puffy wear designer
dialog: clothes that may cost more than the entire budget of other
dialog: video shoots.
speaker_heading: CEASE (V.0O.)
dialog: For most people, this video was
dialog: hot. But for Chris, it symbolized
text: his life. He evaded and survived
dialog: so many fucking obstacles. Even
text: though his father bailed on him,
dialog: even though he made bad choices, he
dialog: was no longer in jail, he was no
text: longer on the corner slanging rock
dialog: and he was not dead. Just like the
dialog: video, when you thought you had him
text: cornered, he slipped away.
scene_heading: EXT. HYPNOTIZE VIDEO SHOOT - DAY
text: Puffy and Biggie rap to the track as they stand in front of a

scene_heading: INT. TATOO PARLOR - DAY

text: Slowly, the crowd’s attention gets diverted to the front
text: door. THE BAD BOY ENTOURAGE HAS ARRIVED.
text: First it is Puffy, flanked by BODYGUARDS who enter. Then it

dialog: the men, the celebrities, you name it.
dialog: 118.
text: And now as Biggie moves through the crowd receiving love, he
