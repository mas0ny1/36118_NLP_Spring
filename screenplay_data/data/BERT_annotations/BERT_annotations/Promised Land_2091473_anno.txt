scene_heading: INT. ORNATE RESTAURANT, NYC - DAY 1
text: We open on a mirror in a beautiful, ornate bathroom.
text: Suddenly a man comes up from below frame with water dripping
text: off his face. A bathroom attendant leans in and turns the
text: faucet off for him as he hands him a towel. The man says
dialog: “Thank you”. This is STEVE BUTLER. A man in his late 30's,
dialog: handsome, and reminiscent of a guy you went to college with.
text: As he dries his face he looks at himself. After a long beat
text: he takes a deep breath. And walks out into:
text: An enormous beautiful main room of a restaurant. We follow
text: Steve as he walks through the restaurant that drips with gold
text: leaf and marble. As we take in this almost surreal room...
text: the title card comes up across the screen.
speaker_heading: PROMISED LAND
text: We follow the man as he finally arrives at his table. There
text: aman sits checking his blackberry. This is David Churchill,
dialog: aman in his early 50’s and the CFO of Global Crosspower
dialog: Solutions; one of the largest energy corporations in the
text: country. An impeccably dressed waitress comes to the table
text: behind Steve.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Can I get either of you gentlemen
dialog: anything else?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You want another drink?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I'm fine thanks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (To waitress)
dialog: We'll have another bottle of the
dialog: Chateau Margaux.
text: Waitress leaves.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You'll be fine!
text: David checks his watch.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Listen, I’m sorry Michael isn’t
dialog: here yet. His plane was delayed
text: getting into Teterboro.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh, that’s no problem.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He likes to meet every executive
dialog: candidate, it’s kind of a
dialog: tradition... or a neuroses.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, that’s nice of him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: It is actually. Until he does his
dialog: one joke. “I thought you said he
dialog: wasn’t handsome.”
text: Steve laughs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: An oldie but a goodie.
text: The waitress comes back with the bottle of wine and shows
text: David the label. He nods.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What time you heading out tomorrow?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, Sue’s already there. I was
dialog: actually going to catch the last
dialog: bus tonight. Be there to get
dialog: started first thing tomorrow
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sue Thomason, right? Jesus! That
dialog: was the first thing they said about
dialog: you two. You don’t stop.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, I don’t know about that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I do. It’s why we're talking right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (Tastes wine. To waitress)
dialog: Great. (to Steve as she pours)
dialog: When we called the office out West
dialog: you were the only name they gave
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, that’s really nice.
text: Waitress exits.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Listen, Steve, this is a 9 billion
dialog: dollar company. If someone is
dialog: recommending you? It’s not nice...
dialog: it’s numbers.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I appreciate that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You are the only person from the
dialog: field we're interviewing.
text: This lands on Steve.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let me ask you something. You guys
dialog: have closed more towns than the
dialog: team behind you by triple digits.
dialog: And your total price point on what
dialog: we pay out on your leases is almost
dialog: half of everyone else’s. How do
dialog: you do that?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I mean, I grew up in Eldridge,
dialog: Iowa.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: «+. Meaning?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It might as well have been Rifle,
dialog: Colorado; Dish, Texas or Lafayette,
dialog: Louisiana. Any of the places we’ve
dialog: sold. They know me. And I know
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, unfortunately it seems the
dialog: rest of our road teams don’t see it
dialog: as quite so easy.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: .-. I grew up in a large farming
dialog: community. (He rolls his eyes)
dialog: Football Fridays, tractor pulls,
dialog: cow tipping, all of it.
text: David smiles.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I was also one of two in my
dialog: graduating class who went to
dialog: college-- well, who decided to
dialog: pursue something other than
dialog: agriculture. Biggest fight my
dialog: grandfather and I ever had.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There’s just a pride, I guess.
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: It’s delusional self mythologizing.
dialog: And it’s bullshit. We had a
dialog: Caterpillar plant down in Davenport
text: a few miles away.
text: David nods.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: My junior year in high school they
dialog: closed it down. I remember
dialog: thinking nothing of it. By the
dialog: time prom came around I got to see,
dialog: first hand, just how little legs we
dialog: had to stand on. The whole farming
dialog: town fantasy was shattered. And
dialog: what became real clear was that
dialog: without that plant, without that
dialog: industry? We had nothing. And the
dialog: town was just...
text: David is nodding.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I’m not selling them Natural Gas.
dialog: I’m selling them their only way to
dialog: get back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: .-. Well, that brings me to my
dialog: second question which is why the
dialog: hell would we take you off the
dialog: road???
text: Steve laughs. David looks behind Steve and notices
text: something. He raises his glass.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (To Steve)
dialog: Best of luck, Steve.
text: They cheers. Suddenly from behind Steve:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Is this the guy?
text: A man in his 50's walks up to the table. This is Michael
text: Downey, the obvious CEO of Global.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I thought you said he wasn’t
dialog: handsome!
text: Steve smiles. Michael sits down in the booth.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sorry I’m late. Had to stop at
dialog: home on my way. My 11 year
text: daughter dissected a frog in
dialog: science class today. She will not
dialog: stop crying.
text: All the men chuckle.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: 11 years old, can you believe it?
dialog: Is that too young? I didn’t
text: dissect a frog until senior year in
dialog: high school. I mean is that even
dialog: necessary?
dialog: The men acknowledge that’s true.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (To David)
dialog: Ah, what are ya’ gonna do?
text: After moment... David turns to Steve. Now both men look at
dialog: Steve. Was this a legitimate question? In a fraction of a
dialog: second:
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It’s absolutely necessary. It’s
dialog: the pursuit of knowledge. Sure,
text: the frog is sacrificed. But, in
dialog: the name of progress. If your
dialog: daughter doesn’t dissect a frog,
dialog: how will she ever learn to perform
dialog: a triple bypass?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Her tears notwithstanding, this has
dialog: to happen whether she understands
dialog: it or not.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Like getting a vaccine, your kid
dialog: might cry a second from the jab,
dialog: but she ain’t gonna die of polio.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Tell her the good news is it gets
dialog: easier.
text: After a beat... Michael smiles.
speaker_heading: BEGIN CREDITS
scene_heading: EXT. FARM - EARLY MORNING 2
text: In the first minutes of a cool Spring day we see a idyllic
text: landscape of a blood orange colored sky hanging above the
text: tree covered mountains of McKinley, a small town at the foot
text: of a mountain. In the distant foreground of this picturesque
text: still life we see two windows illuminated in a charming, but
text: slightly run down, farm house. To the right and left of the
text: house we see seemingly unending land, low lit to an almost
text: surreal color and covered in perfectly placed hay bales. An
text: unusual sound can be heard... a grunting.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING 3
text: A charming older woman in her 70's exits the squeaky screen
text: door carrying a cup of coffee. She wears an apron and walks
text: with confidence. By the barn we see a pick up truck.
text: Suddenly a man in his late 70’s exits the barn. He wears a
text: flannel shirt with sleeves rolled up and very lived in jeans.
text: From the back of the truck he grabs an enormous bag of feed
text: with the ease of a sack of potatoes. He immediately
text: disappears once again into the barn. After a moment, the
text: woman arrives outside the barn and waits. As the man exits,
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Well... any other horses and I'd
dialog: say that should last the rest of
dialog: the month.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: So we’ll need more by Friday.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Sounds about right.
text: The woman hands him the cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: The woman smiles and pats the man on the back. As he heads
text: to his truck.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I’1l bring this one back.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Oh yeah? Bring the other five
dialog: while you're at it.
text: She holds up a powder blue mug.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: This is the only one I’ve got left!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yes ma’am.
text: He gets into his truck and pulls away.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS - LATER
text: From up above we see the bus as it rolls through beautiful
dialog: farm land.
scene_heading: INT. BUS
text: Steve sits on a bus looking out the window at the pastoral
text: landscape as it passes by.
scene_heading: INT/EXT TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY 4
text: The man is drinking his coffee as the truck drives through
text: this incredibly beautiful farmland. He waves out the window
text: to a couple of men standing in a pasture with a large number
dialog: of cattle.
text: As the truck pulls up to an intersection and turns right we
text: see a very small church on the corner... the slight
text: beginnings of a town center.
text: Arriving to a stop light the truck pauses. Then with the
text: audible flick of a green light the truck turns onto the top
text: of Main St., the epicenter of this area. In the low light of
text: the morning the small stretch is almost picturesque, but as
text: the truck rumbles on we see the reality of the more modern
dialog: small town America.
speaker_heading: 7A
text: Interspersed with the more common necessities like a coffee
text: shop and barber shop are a number of boarded up windows and
text: empty store fronts.
text: The truck finally rumbles out of frame as we hold on the
text: exterior of a motel.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL - PARKING LOT - DAY 5
text: Steve exits from the motel and begins to walk across the
text: parking lot. He is checking his blackberry. He looks up as
dialog: we cut to:
text: A woman in her 50’s standing in front of a very used Ford
text: Bronco. This is SUE THOMASON. She’s attractive, put-together
dialog: and Steve's leasing partner for the past 6 years... But more
dialog: often then not she feels like his big sister. She wears jeans
text: and a light sweater over a plaid shirt.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Do I have to call you ‘Boss’ now?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Will you stop.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: They’11 let me know.
text: Sue smiles.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (referencing the car)
dialog: This is the best you could do?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No. But, I wasn’t looking for the
dialog: best, was I?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You know what I mean.
text: He heads past her toward the driver’s side door.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Stick!
text: Steve immediately stops, familiar with this moment, and in
text: one motion is heading back around to the passenger side... he
dialog: doesn’t drive stick shift.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You do it on purpose.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You're right, I do... boss.
text: They get in. In a wide shot we hear Sue try to start the
text: car. It doesn’t turn over.
speaker_heading: STEVE (0.S.)
dialog: Worth it?
text: The car starts.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Suck it!
scene_heading: INT/EXT BRONCO - ROB’S GUNS, GROCERY, GUITARS AND GAS - DAY6
text: Sue and Steve are driving. Steve looks at a map, drinking a
text: bottle of water.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Girl at the hotel said it’s right
dialog: around here. Has everything.
text: Steve looks up as Sue pulls into a small parking lot. They
text: look up at the sign that says ‘Rob’s Guns, Grocery, Guitars
text: and Gas.’ Sue reads aloud:
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: “Rob's Guns, Grocery, Guitars and
dialog: Gas.”
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (marveling at the sign)
dialog: God, I wish I thought of that.
scene_heading: INT. ROB’S GUNS, GROCERY, GUITARS AND GAS - DAY 7
text: Steve and Sue walk through to the back of a small local store
text: that seems like it might actually have everything.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Where'd they put you up? Four
dialog: Seasons?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: The Pierre.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Jesus!
text: They keep walking. Steve smiles.
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And, I was right, this is the entry
dialog: point for the whole state.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I love it! Feels like dominoes.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It is.
text: They arrive at a few racks of clothes and begin carefully
text: picking out clothes. Sue grabs a few flannel shirts.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What season is this? Do they even
dialog: still wear flannel now?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Oh please, up here, they always
dialog: wear flannel.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: «-.- Or camo.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I’m not wearing camo.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: How was Houston? How’s Danny?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: He’s 15. He’s gone... but he
dialog: started baseball. Made varsity.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: As a freshman? Sue, that’s huge!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I guess. His first game is this
dialog: weekend and my missing it will go
dialog: to the top of the list of things
dialog: he'll cover with his shrink at 45.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Hey, someone’s gotta pay for his
dialog: xbox.
text: Steve picks up a pair of work gloves.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You need a new pair?
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I never use them.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That’s a yes. Ok, you ready?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Boots!
text: Steve looks down at his boots. They are Caterpillar work
dialog: boots.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I’m not going over this again, Sue.
dialog: These are the best boots money can
dialog: buy and they’re made in America.
text: Sue looks at him confused.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yeah, but yours are old.
text: Sue walks away to the check out counter, which is actually a
text: gun case. Steve follows. Behind the counter is one rack of
text: larger guns and sure enough... a rack of guitars.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Staring at the guitars)
dialog: Wow, you really have them.
text: The man behind the counter looks up from a book. This is
text: ROB. He is about 40, and in his black jeans, collared shirt
dialog: and vest he doesn’t look like what you’d imagine a local to
dialog: look like.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: So I take it you’re not here to buy
text: a guitar.
text: Sue smiles and looks for a credit card in her wallet.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: You’re the natural gas people.
text: Sue is taken aback.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Apologizing right off the bat, I
dialog: like it! It’s endearing and
dialog: vulnerable and yet... honest and
dialog: direct.
speaker_heading: 11A
text: Sue doesn’t know what to say. She almost looks back at Steve
dialog: but thinks better of it.
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (Pointing at her wallet)
dialog: The ID card is kind of a dead give
dialog: away.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: ‘Bout time you all showed up.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Well, hell yes. What other choice
dialog: we got? We can’t sell the scenery!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Wow... wanna come work for us?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: What... and leave all this?
text: He sarcastically gestures to his weird store. Sue smiles.
scene_heading: INT/EXT BRONCO - DRIVING - DAY 8
text: Sue is driving. They are both now wearing brand new clothes.
text: Steve is drinking from a bottle of water.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I can’t believe this so close to
dialog: the city. Looks like Kentucky.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Two hours outside any city is
dialog: Kentucky. You should know that.
text: Sue notices a group of horses by the road.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Hey... Does something seem weird
dialog: about those horses?
text: They both look out to the side of the road. There are 6 or so
text: horses, with long, almost decorative, manes.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No. Not really.
dialog: (squinting)
dialog: Wait. Are they small?
dialog: 10
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: They seem very small. Could they be
dialog: that small? My eyesight’s going.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Maybe they're ponies?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: They’re not ponies!!...
dialog: I mean I guess they could be
dialog: ponies...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Remember new region, so we can go
dialog: as high as 5000 and 18%. But it
dialog: doesn’t mean we have to.
text: Beat. The car is slowing down.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Don’t ponies have big heads? Like,
dialog: proportionally?
text: Sue pulls over to the side of the road. She hands Steve a
text: clipboard with a complicated looking list of names, addresses
text: and other figures. He is checking his blackberry again. He
text: hops out.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE ROAD - DAY 9
text: We see the Bronco is parked at the base of a long dirt
text: driveway leading up to a rather dilapidated farmhouse. The
text: Bronco and the house seem like mere specks in the middle of
text: the seemingly endless landscape around them.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 10
text: Steve walks up to the house where a young girl is pushing a
text: small toy lawn mower out front.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hello there! Are you the owner of
dialog: this place?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No? Well then how come you’re
dialog: doing all the work?
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, who do I talk to about that?
text: The girl laughs and begins to lead him into the house.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: My Dad.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, alright then, let’s go inside
dialog: and straighten all this out!
text: Steve smiles and gently pats the girl’s head as the two walk
text: toward the stairs. At the top, a man opens the screen door.
text: This is DREW SCOTT.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Didn't they already finish the
dialog: census?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, I’m not from the census. I’m
dialog: from a Natural Gas company. You
dialog: have a second?
text: Steve and the girl get to the top of the steps.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh, hell! Why didn’t you say so!
dialog: Come on in!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You just go shopping?
text: Steve looks up at him. Drew gestures to his neck.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You got a tag stickin’ out of your
dialog: collar.
text: He reaches over and yanks the tag from Steve’s collar.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: There ya go.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So much for looking local.
dialog: 11
dialog: 15
text: As Steve crosses the threshold Drew looks down.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Nice boots.
text: Steve’s smile is bigger than it should be.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY 11
text: Sue sits in a sparse living room with a woman in her late
text: 20's. She is naturally pretty and very sweet. This is
text: CLAIRE ALLEN. Suddenly a 10 year old comes by and sets down
text: 2 glasses of red Hi-C for the woman and for Sue. He is
text: wearing a t-shirt with YANKEES written in marker on the front
text: and the number ‘15’ written on the back along with his last
speaker_heading: name, ALLEN.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Thanks Carson.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Thanks. Wild color, right? (puts
text: the glass down without touching it.
dialog: This does not go unnoticed by
dialog: Claire)
text: Sue points at Carson's watch.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Is that Thor?
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: No, it’s IRONMAN.
text: He shows her.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Oooh, my son would love that!
text: She pretends to take it. Carson laughs.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Nooo!
text: He walks away.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You have kids Ms. Thomason?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (pulls out phone) Yes I do. Danny.
dialog: 15 and ornery.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: He looks sweet.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yours is sweeter.
text: The two women laugh. Carson re-enters.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Mom, can I play xbox?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Just for a bit. And only because
dialog: you're going outside for baseball
dialog: in an hour.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Sweet!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (For Sue’s benefit)
dialog: Sorry about that. I know I
dialog: shouldn't let him..
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Are you kidding! Of course! From
dialog: the minute we meet them and see
dialog: their little squishy faces we'd do
dialog: anything for 'em!... Anything.
text: Carson nods and leaves. Claire turns back to Sue.
speaker_heading: 15A
dialog: We can
text: see Carson in the background playing Xbox for the rest of the
dialog: scene.
scene_heading: 12 INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
dialog: 16
dialog: 12
text: Steve now sits at the kitchen table with DREW. His daughter
text: is coloring at the table as well.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh man, have we been waiting on
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: It’s unbelievable! I was just
text: reading in the paper THIS MORNING
dialog: about all that gas drillin’ goin’
dialog: on in Pennsylvania.
text: He looks at the paper.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: This your outfit? ‘Stanton Gas’?
text: Steve glances over casually.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, there are a bunch of companies.
dialog: We're with ‘Global Crosspower
dialog: Solutions’.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Well, you guys are probably the
dialog: best!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You wanna come work for us?
text: The two men laugh.
scene_heading: 13 INT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY
text: Sue sits with Claire.
dialog: 13
dialog: 17
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Here’s the thing, Claire. And it’s
dialog: important that you know this...
dialog: The initial phase of development
dialog: for drilling is ALSO the initial
dialog: phase of the town’s tax revenue.
dialog: Which means money will be injected
dialog: into the town and its
dialog: infrastructure immediately!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That sounds impressive.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I know, a lot of fancy words. But
dialog: here’s what it means to me. The
dialog: number one reason I chose to live
dialog: where I do is for the school that
dialog: my boy goes to. I just want what
dialog: most parents want for their kids.
dialog: Everything. And that everything
text: starts with his education.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You sound like a good mother.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Far from good. Honest maybe. Do
dialog: you think your town's school system
dialog: is underfunded?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: In a school system like yours, the
dialog: chances of Carson going to college
dialog: are too low. And in today's
dialog: market, without a college degree,
dialog: the only jobs available are manual
dialog: labor... and those jobs are
text: going... if not gone. TECHNOLOGY
dialog: is our sons' future.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes!! We tried to get a computer
dialog: system for the kids last year but
dialog: it never happened.
speaker_heading: 17A
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Well, there's no reason why your
dialog: town shouldn't have a state of the
dialog: art high school and your son
dialog: guaranteed an education that allows
dialog: him to compete on the highest
dialog: level. He'll have a chance...
text: Beat. This registers with Claire.
dialog: 18
scene_heading: 14 INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY 14
text: Steve and Drew at the kitchen table.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Our leases start at $2000.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Wait... that’s it?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Well, that’s not necessarily life
dialog: changing money, is it?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Per acre. And you have 20. Now,
dialog: there are a lot of people around
dialog: here that would say $40,000, well,
dialog: that’s pretty good money...
dialog: Especially for doing nothing.
text: Drew wipes sweat off his face. Looks at Steve.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: But, the real reason I’m here in
dialog: this early stage is because our
dialog: research shows that your particular
dialog: plot of land has a potentially
dialog: “high yield”. That means that not
dialog: only the size of the deposit, but
dialog: the quality of the shale is in the
dialog: top tier.
text: Drew, as if watching a thriller movie.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Mm Hm...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Now we at Global don’t want to be
dialog: tenants... We want to be partners.
dialog: That’s why we offer an 12 anda
dialog: half percent share in any and all
dialog: profits we see from your wells.
dialog: 15
dialog: 19
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: And with this... this top tier
dialog: level of shit, what kind of figures
dialog: are we looking at?

dialog: Well, it’s hard to tell until we
dialog: get down there, but--
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Ballpark, man! Like other people
dialog: who have had a similar situation?
dialog: Beat...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Millions...
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Wait.. What do you mean? Like, you
dialog: guys... uh...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You...... Could be. A

text: Drew’s look is ... elated? Scared? Dead?
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY 15
text: Steve walks into the nearly empty diner that looks like a
text: time capsule. He sees a man wave his hand and joins him ina
text: vinyl booth in the back. The man is GERRY RICHARDS, he’s
text: about 60 years old and one of McKinley’s three town
text: supervisors. Steve introduces himself and sits down.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Supervisor Richards? Steve Butler.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Call me Gerry for God's sake.
text: A waitress comes over to the table and drops 2 menus.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Anything to drink?
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Steve?
dialog: 20
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I‘1ll have a cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: And, you, sir.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: I’m fine thanks.
text: She exits.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Well, listen, I appreciate you
dialog: sitting down with me here, I know
dialog: you're busy so I just thought it
dialog: might be nice to meet before the
dialog: town hall tomorrow so we can get to
dialog: know each other a little bit.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Of course! Listen, as the most
dialog: senior member of the supervisors
dialog: board thank YOU for sitting down
dialog: with ME. Appreciate it.
text: Richards laughs.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: It’s exciting all this natural gas
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It is! Very exciting!
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: (Leans in and whispers
dialog: with a smile)
dialog: A whole lot of money down there!
text: Steve laughs.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That’s also true, yes!
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: How much do you think? (He
dialog: gestures) How much money we got
dialog: down there?
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 21
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, our research department
dialog: hasn't finished their analysis yet
dialog: but I’d say somewhere between 15 or
dialog: 20 million dollars!
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Could be!
text: Lynn returns with a cup of coffee and a creamers.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: So, I’ve been doing a little
dialog: research about all this, gone
dialog: online a little bit. And well,
dialog: I’ve read all these rumblings of
dialog: Natural Gas possibly contaminating
dialog: water sources? Killing crops and
dialog: what not?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I understand your concern. I’ve
dialog: read all those stories myself. And
dialog: let me assure you--
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: People lighting their water on
dialog: fire? People getting sick? That
dialog: sounds nasty.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: These are just scare tactics--
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: I have a responsibility to protect
dialog: these people. To ensure their
dialog: safety. And, well, to be honest
dialog: I’m just not sure I’m too
dialog: comfortable telling my constituents
dialog: to allow you folks into our town.
dialog: No matter how much money you have.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Mr. Richards--
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: There’s a lot of people counting on
dialog: me, Steve and not just in this
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 22
speaker_heading: RICHARDS (CONT'D)
dialog: People look to me in the next town
dialog: and the next town. You see, I have
dialog: the opportunity to set a precedent
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Look, there are answers to
dialog: everything you just brought up--
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Now, I know you all have quite an
dialog: operation in the works, here.
dialog: Plans to set up all throughout the
dialog: state. I’d hate to be the guy to
dialog: jeopardize all that for you.
text: Steve looks up. Richards is looking directly at him. He has
text: a smile on his face... a different smile.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: To lead this one little “podunk”
dialog: town to reject your company. To
dialog: reject natural Gas. I mean I can’t
dialog: even imagine what that would mean
dialog: for you guys. (Richards changes)
dialog: And if that story got around? In
dialog: the papers? On the news? Can you
dialog: imagine? What that would do to
dialog: your balance sheet?
text: There’s a long beat. Both men stare each other down.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It’s 30,000.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We can offer you 30,000 dollars.
text: The waitress comes back to the table.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Can I get you anything else?
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: (Without breaking his
dialog: stare at Steve)
dialog: You know what, Lynn, I think we're
dialog: done here. Just the check please.
text: She exits. Richards grabs his jacket. Then he pulls out a
text: small note pad.
dialog: 23
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: (Reading)
text: The Marcellus shale. Estimated at
text: 2 TRILLION dollars. With BILLIONS
dialog: in potential tax revenue to
dialog: individual states.
dialog: Back to Steve.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Google. First one that came up...
dialog: First sentence... Now do you wanna
dialog: re-think that joke number you
dialog: mentioned earlier?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Mr. Richards, I’m just being
dialog: straight with you here. It’s
dialog: simple math. Best case scenario
dialog: there’s 30 million dollars under
dialog: your town. .1% of that is 30,000
dialog: dollars. They want me to offer as
dialog: low as 10 in these situations.
dialog: But, you seem like a smart guy so
dialog: I’m telling you we have 30.
text: Richards reaches for his jacket. Steve sips coffee.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: «+. But, I’m also telling you this
dialog: is a one time offer.
text: Richard stops and looks at Steve.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Don’t do this. I’ve been here
dialog: before and it doesn’t end well.
dialog: You don’t wanna be last. You're
dialog: right, we have teams in place in
dialog: towns all over this state... and
dialog: the next state. And the next
dialog: state. We’re all the way up to
dialog: Maine now. And every one of those
text: towns are signing fast.
text: Richards smiles, saying nothing.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Look, I don’t fault you for trying.
dialog: But, I’m telling you-- hell, I’m
dialog: begging you. Don’t do this.
dialog: Because the truth is we will walk
dialog: away. We always do...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 16
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: And then after every single town
dialog: within 3 states has signed up and
dialog: the blows of this economy are
dialog: almost unbearable... we’1ll come
dialog: back. And we'll offer you nothing.
dialog: We'll offer this town nothing.
dialog: Every lease we’ve signed, every
dialog: piece of the pie we've offered. It
dialog: all goes away... and we buy this
dialog: place for nothing.
text: Richards’ face has changed.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Let some other guy be last.
text: The waitress comes back to the table with the check. He
text: hands her a 20 dollar bill.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Thank you.
text: Steve stands up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So, I'll see you tomorrow?
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: I’1ll see you tomorrow.
text: Steve exits leaving Richards there to contemplate what
dialog: could've just happened.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY 16
text: Sue and Steve walk down the hallway. Steve is, once again,
text: checking his blackberry. Sue stops at a door and opens it.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Nice job today.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Kind of anti-climactic. I thought
dialog: it'd harder. This one’s easy!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: They always are.
speaker_heading: 24A
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Well, good let’s wrap this up and
dialog: get the hell out of here early.
dialog: Maybe I can fly home for the
dialog: weekend game before we head
text: upstate.
dialog: 17
dialog: 25
text: Steve is still looking at his blackberry. Suddenly... he
text: freezes.
dialog: Long beat.
text: Sue notices.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What?
text: He turns back to her.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I got it.
text: Sue smiles. After possibly a moment too long she walks over
dialog: and gives
dialog: now see...
dialog: She gives
dialog: and turns
dialog: She turns
text: him a hug. With her face over his shoulder, we can
dialog: her conflict.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... That’s great.
text: him a motherly kiss on the cheek. Then sniffles
text: back to her door so Steve doesn’t see her tears.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I’m proud of you.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sue!
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Buy the plane ticket tonight. I/’11
dialog: even pay for it.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Cocky bastard.
text: She goes into her room.
text: Steve turns and walks down the hallway. As the news finally
dialog: sinks in,
text: he smiles huge.
text: Music begins to play as we:
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S - NIGHT 17
text: Welcome to ‘Buddy's’, the center of social life in McKinley.
text: It’s warm and welcoming, a cross between hunting lodge and
dialog: dive bar.
text: There’s a long bar and an adjacent dining area, U-
text: shaped around a small stage. About a dozen animals, mostly
text: deer and moose, are mounted on the wall. The place is full of
text: beer signs and photos of locals with big catches and hunters
text: with one foot on dead 10-point bucks.
dialog: 26
text: Steve is at the bar, drinking a scotch. Next to him is his
text: plastic bottle of water. The bartender, an enormous man in
text: his 60's who is obviously the leader of a motorcycle gang,
text: pours him another scotch from a very dusty bottle.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: You want me to leave the bottle?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Uh... yeah, sure. Thanks.
text: He takes a sip.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (0.C.)
dialog: Three more, Jesse.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Well, goddamn.
text: Steve turns to see a young woman at the bar.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Don’t judge me Jesse, it’s my
dialog: birthday.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I didn’t say nothin’.
text: This is ALICE. There’s a part of her that’s likely still the
dialog: Girl Next Door, but the part we meet is a bit rough around
text: the edges. She’s pretty without trying and she knows it. It
text: is her birthday, a fact that is quite apparent from how tipsy
dialog: she is.
text: Alice looks over and sees Steve looking at her. He
text: immediately turns away.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Lemme guess. 40. Marketing.
dialog: Married. 2 kids.
text: Steve doesn’t look up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: 38. Stripper/Waitress but was
dialog: “born” to be a singer.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Hey, asshole I’m a teacher!
text: Steve finally turns to her for the first time.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I was talking about me.
dialog: 27
text: Alice wants to laugh but doesn’t.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You're a waitress?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Times are tough.
text: Beat. Without taking his eyes off of her.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Do you want a dance? 100 bucks per
dialog: song.
text: Alice finally laughs.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: That’s insane. I wouldn’t pay 30!
text: Steve still not giving in.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You haven’t seen my moves.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Ok, now you're creeping me out.
text: Steve finally laughs. Reaches to shake her hand.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Steve.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Alice.
text: Jesse brings back 3 Budweiser bottles and 3 Jack Daniels
dialog: shots.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You’re goin’ big for a school
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: It's my birthday.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Really. Well, tomorrow.
dialog: 28
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Do they give you the day off for
dialog: your birthday? Or do you just tell
dialog: the kids you’ve got a stomach bug.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: First off, I resent the implication
dialog: that I can’t hold my liquor... And
dialog: secondly... the first two periods
dialog: we watch videos.
speaker_heading: STEVE
speaker_heading: AH!
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: So?...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: What brings you to our booming
dialog: metropolis?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, I’m from a small town myself
dialog: so it feels a lot like home.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Oh yeah? Where’s that?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Eldridge, Iowa.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Ah, you're a buckeye!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That’s Ohio, actually.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Same thing.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Ok.
text: Steve smiles. From off camera we hear a group of girls yell.
speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: Alice, let’s go!
text: Steve looks over to see three girls at a table against the
text: wall. They are Alice’s friends, the one yelling is GWEN,
text: full-figured and loud -- she thinks she’s Bette Midler.
dialog: 29
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, it was nice meeting you.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You even gonna buy a girl a
dialog: birthday drink?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That would communicate the wrong
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You’re an asshole.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Of course I'll buy your drinks.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Absolutely not, you lost your
dialog: chance.
text: Gwen yells again from the table. As Alice looks, Steve
text: stares at her and smiles.
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: What are we doin’? We drinkin’ or
dialog: not?
text: Alice looks back at Steve.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: How long you in town?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Uhh-- a bit. I’m gonna be around
dialog: for a bit.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You’re gonna be “Around for a bit?”
dialog: ++. You're a terrible liar.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I’m not lying!
text: Alice smiles, skeptical.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Well, you wanna give a girl a real
dialog: birthday gift?
dialog: Steve smiles. Seems a little forward, but hey!
dialog: 30
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sure.
text: Alice doesn’t break eye contact with Steve. After a beat.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Jesse, we're playing ABSOLUT
speaker_heading: MADNESS.
text: Steve, still smiling, is confused.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What’s ABSOLUT MADNESS?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: It's pretty much what it sounds
dialog: like. You and Jesse both drink 5
dialog: shots in 5 minutes and if you can
dialog: get closer to the bulls eye on that
dialog: dartboard we drink for free and you
dialog: get your Polaroid on the wall.
text: She points behind the bar to a line of Polaroids of men
text: completely annihilated.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That’s not at all what it sounds
dialog: like. I’m in.
text: Jesse begins setting up shot glasses. And slams down a
text: bottle of Absolut vodka. Other people in the bar start
text: gathering to watch. Steve notices.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: How bout this! We drink 8 shots in
dialog: 8 minutes and EVERYONE here drinks
dialog: for free!
text: Jesse looks to Alice concerned. She laughs knowingly.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Sure!
text: Every one cheers! Jesse shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Good luck!

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - MORNING 18
text: Steve is dead asleep on a couch that is too small for him. He
text: is covered in what looks like a hand made blanket. He is
text: jarred awake... by nothing.
text: He takes in his surroundings. All of a sudden we see Alice
text: sitting at a small table. She is completely dressed and ready
text: for the day. She drinks a cup of coffee as she reads the
dialog: morning paper online.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Oh thank God, you’re still pretty
dialog: handsome.
text: He stares at her for a moment putting the pieces of his head
dialog: back together.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You're late.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Your phone hasn’t stop buzzing for
dialog: the last half hour.
text: Steve checks his phone. Sees the missed calls and more
text: importantly, he sees the time. He is very late.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: SHIT!
text: He immediately jumps up... that wasn’t a good idea. He
text: flinches for a split second. Then begins quickly getting
text: dressed. (He is wearing the same shirt but just boxers.)
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Listen, I had a really great time.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well... I just mean--
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Nothing happened, Steve.
text: Beat. Steve is confused.
dialog: 32
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Well, actually you did kiss me just
dialog: before you threw up the first time.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh my God! I’m really sorry. Thank
dialog: you... for letting me stay.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: It’s fine. I was gonna let you
dialog: sleep in your car, but you couldn't
dialog: remember which one was yours.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I didn’t drive.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Well then it’s a good thing I
dialog: didn’t let you sleep in your car.
text: Steve is now basically dressed. A dreaded part of the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So... can I take your number?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You’re gonna be “around for a bit”,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Uh---
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: It’s not that big a town. You'll
dialog: see me again.
text: Steve is still putting everything together.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: O-- Ok. Is the-- Is the door--?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: At the front of the house. When you
dialog: get to it, you’ll find a knob. Turn
dialog: the knob and --
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh god. Too early for that.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 19
dialog: 33
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well... Thanks.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Your welcome.
text: In a daze, Steve goes to leave. Then comes back again.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey, happy birthday!
text: He leaves. Alice smiles.
scene_heading: EXT MOTEL - DAY 19
text: Sue, in the car, is in the foreground talking on the phone.
text: Out the driver side window we see a tiny blurry figure that
text: we are not paying attention to. As Sue continues to talk on
text: the phone, the blurry figure gets closer and closer, then
text: stops... is it bending over to catch his breath? Or
dialog: retching?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What’s wrong?... Because you called
dialog: me 3 times... What?... What do you
dialog: mean you were burned?... Why were
dialog: you using an iron?.... He asked
dialog: YOU to do it? Fantastic!... I
dialog: highly doubt it’s burned OFF,
dialog: Danny. What did the nurse say?
dialog: Throwing hand or catching hand? So
dialog: can you play this weekend? What you
dialog: mean pitch? When did the coach say
dialog: that? Danny, that’s AMAZING!
text: Finally the blur continues to come closer until he is right
text: up at the window exhausted... and nauseous. It’s Steve.
text: Instinctually, Sue slowly turns her head and stares at him.
text: Steve pops up. Through the glass we hear:
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: 5 minutes!
text: He pauses, taking one more second to recover. Then runs out
dialog: of frame.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No, no, I’m just at work. Hey,
dialog: guess what? I’1l be there! I
dialog: booked it last night... Hello?
dialog: Danny, can you hear me?... I’m

scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY 21
text: At half court there are 3 people sitting in folding chairs;
text: the town supervisors. In the bleachers facing them are about
text: 400 people finding seats. Supervisor Richards is standing in
text: front of the crowd. He briefly looks over by the door to the
text: side of the bleachers where tucked away, just out of view,
text: Steve and Sue look on. Steve holds a bottle of water.
text: A man is whispering in Richards ear. Richards acknowledges
dialog: and speaks:
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Ok, if everyone could find a seat
dialog: we'll begin in a moment. Thank
dialog: you.
text: Steve is typing on his blackberry. Sue looks at Richards and
text: drinks a lemonade.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: He all set?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, he’s on board. What is that?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Lemonade.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Is it good?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: GREAT! Fresh squeezed. There’s a
dialog: kid selling it out there. She’s
dialog: cleaning up! You want one?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (Holding up bottle of
dialog: water)
dialog: No.
text: People are still filing in by Sue and Steve. Most of them
dialog: carry lemonades.
dialog: 35
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: How many do we have.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Signed 14 today. So that’s 27.
dialog: Think we’ll only need the one more
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I still can’t believe that’s why
dialog: you were late this morning? We got
dialog: back from dinner at 930!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: She was very cool. You’d like her.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You don’t want to make statements
dialog: like that just yet. Name?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Alice.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Alice? ...
text: Sue stops and looks over.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... Was she elderly?
text: Steve shoots her a look as Richards begins to speak.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Ok, I appreciate you all coming
dialog: today. Unfortunately there seems
dialog: to have been a scheduling error so
dialog: we'll have to make this quick...
dialog: Well, this is quite a turn out!
dialog: We're not used to standing room
dialog: only. I must be doing something
dialog: right!
text: Richards gives a politician’s smile. People murmur a
dialog: response.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Ok, let’s get right to it. Now, I
dialog: know some of you have been hearing
dialog: dribs and drabs about all this
dialog: natural gas stuff. Maybe some of
dialog: you even have family or friends who
dialog: have had natural gas come to their
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 36
speaker_heading: RICHARDS (CONT'D)
dialog: In which case, I’m sure you’ve
dialog: heard, then, what a life changing
dialog: opportunity it is. Creating
dialog: HUNDREDS of jobs, and therefore
dialog: millions of dollars in revenue and
dialog: large injections of funding into
dialog: town infrastructure.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Well, I am very happy to announce
dialog: that we will be bringing natural
dialog: gas to McKinley!
text: There is a burst of applause. Sue and Steve notice.
text: Suddenly a voice bursts out from the crowd.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: How do they get the gas??
text: Everyone looks for the voice, including Richards and Sue.
text: Steve looks up for a brief second but finishes whatever e-
text: mail he’s working on.
text: Richards spots the source of the voice. This is FRANK YATES.
text: He is about 70 years old, but his level of physical
dialog: strength... and calm strength of spirit, is apparent
text: immediately. We recognize him as the man who drove the truck
text: in the credit sequence.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: Ah! How are ya, Frank? If you
dialog: wouldn't mind just holding on for
dialog: one minute, there’1ll be time for
text: questions at the end. Now, the
dialog: company we'll be working with is
dialog: called Global Crosspower Solutions
dialog: and--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I apologize, I was just wondering
dialog: how it all works, that’s all.
text: We can see members of the crowd now turning back to Richards
text: to hear his response. Steve, again, looks up. He is
text: completely confident in his new employee.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: Well, its a rather complex
dialog: process...
text: Beat. People wait for a response.
dialog: 37
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: But I will, uh, explain it as
dialog: simply as I can... There are, uh,
text: rock deposits underground. Deep,
text: under ground. MILES underground!
dialog: And what they do is create these
dialog: drills that go 2 or 3 miles down
dialog: and break up the rock... shale,
dialog: it’s called shale. And that
dialog: breaking of the rock is what
dialog: actually releases the gas--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Its called Fracking.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The process. Its called Fracking.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: That's right. That’s right. Now,
dialog: Frank if you’d just let me finish
dialog: please I--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I would encourage all of you to go
dialog: home and Google this word and see
dialog: what you find. Unfortunately, it’s
dialog: not nearly as simple as what
text: Supervisor Richards just laid out.
dialog: Now, listen, it’s true there is
dialog: some money to be made having this
dialog: industry coming in, but can we at
dialog: least not pretend that it is not
dialog: without cost.
text: Without taking her eyes off Frank, Sue hits Steve’s arm, who
text: has finally looked up from his blackberry.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Just...hold on.

dialog: Frank, now, I’m gonna have to ask
dialog: you to stop this. This is
dialog: completely inappropriate. And not
dialog: at all the forum to have this
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Gerry, we've all known this was a
dialog: possibility. And now it’s here.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 38
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: So, seems to me this is the ONLY
dialog: forum to have this conversation.
text: Drew turns around from a row or two in front to talk to Frank
text: respectfully.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Frank, I’m sure we all appreciate
dialog: the point you’re trying to make,
dialog: but there really isn’t any decision
dialog: here. We need this.
text: There are grumbles of support for Drew. Frank looks around
text: and then slowly stands up. Next to him, his wife attempts to
text: keep him seated for a moment. People stop to listen.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m sorry. But, this thing here.
dialog: It may not be the saving grace you
dialog: all want it to be. Now, Gerry
dialog: started this thing by saying that
dialog: Natural Gas coming here is life
dialog: changing... and it is. It’sa
dialog: clean and efficient resource, but
dialog: the way we go about getting it is
dialog: some dirty business.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: With all due respect I think you’re
dialog: out of your league.
text: Steve and Sue look on. Richards tries to maintain control.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And the potential for error is just
dialog: too high and the results can be
dialog: both horrible and irreversible.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Thank you, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There are reports from all over the
dialog: country of people’s water being
dialog: contaminated.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No, no, no...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: People who have to haul their own
text: water from miles away. It’s harder
dialog: to get enough for your crops and
dialog: cattle-- Let alone to drink.
dialog: 39
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Ok, Frank. I’ve absolutely had
dialog: enough of this! We don’t have to--
text: All of a sudden Steve steps out from behind the bleachers.
text: Sue reaches to grab him.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Steve--
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (cutting her off without
dialog: looking. )
dialog: I’ve got this.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Goddamn it.
text: Steve arrives next to Richards completely calm.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sorry I’m late, Mr. Richards. What
dialog: did I miss?
text: Everyone looks down to Steve... he has never been so public
text: in his career. Steve looks up at Frank.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh, I’m sorry I think I interrupted
dialog: you Mrrrrrrrr?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yates.... My name is Frank Yates.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh, Mr. Yates, are you connected
dialog: with an environmental group?
text: Frank chuckles.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh, what line of work you in, Sir?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m a teacher here at the high
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: A teacher.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I teach science. What about you,
dialog: Mrrrrrrrr?
dialog: 40
text: A few people chuckle at Frank’s confident retort, including
dialog: Steve.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: My name is Steve Butler. I’ma
dialog: consultant, here, for Global
dialog: Crosspower Solutions.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ah, then you’re the man we have to
dialog: thank for all that money.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I wish! No, I’m just the guy that
dialog: works for the guy that works for
dialog: the guy that may have had something
dialog: to do with all that money.
text: There are some laughs from the crowd.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I only heard the last part of what
dialog: you were saying, but you sound like
dialog: aman that’s certainly done his
dialog: homework! Where, may I ask did you
dialog: get all your information?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Mr. Butler, you and I both know the
dialog: information I'm referring to is
text: vast and detailed.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You're probably right. And I’m
dialog: sure I’m not the guy who has all
dialog: the answers.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh, then you’d be the perfect guy
dialog: for them to send to deny
dialog: everything.
text: Beat. Steve smiles and chuckles again.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Listen, I’m not going to deny that
dialog: this issue has been made very
dialog: complicated by a number of
dialog: companies that have had their fair
dialog: share of incidents.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 4l
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: But, natural gas is not a new
dialog: issue. We've been drilling in
dialog: this country for over 50 years.
dialog: And like any industry, you evolve.
dialog: My company alone has invested
dialog: millions and millions of dollars.
dialog: Now why would we do that? If we’re
dialog: this ‘evil machine’ that cares
dialog: about nothing but the bottom line,
dialog: why would we invest in something
dialog: that is fatally flawed? Because
dialog: instead of being one of the
dialog: companies that is working to make
dialog: the process “faster”, we chose to
dialog: make it “right”!... For this exact
dialog: moment. Because we knew if we
dialog: figured out how to do it right...
dialog: we'd be the only ones on the field.
text: Frank smiles.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But Global is being sued. Is that
dialog: right, Steve? By numerous parties.
dialog: Dealing with this exact technology.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Sure we are. Like any other
dialog: company our size in every other
dialog: industry. And we stand up to those
dialog: people because we’re not in the
dialog: business of handing out free money
dialog: to people who make false claims.
dialog: And we haven’t lost once.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, you can’t lose a game that’s
text: still being played.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Look, Mr. Butler, I’m sure even you
dialog: can admit that Fracking is far from
dialog: a perfect process.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Perfect? (smiles) No, maybe not..
dialog: But with all the government
dialog: restrictions they put on us and
dialog: hoops we have to jump through, it’s
dialog: pretty close to perfect.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 42
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Heck, the only reason why natural
dialog: gas is so big right now is because
dialog: it’s finally the clean alternative
dialog: TO the incredibly dangerous
dialog: industries like coal and oil. If
dialog: you know of another industry that’s
dialog: cleaner than this and can have this
dialog: big an impact on our country right
dialog: now, please tell me, cause I'll go
dialog: work there.
text: Crowd smiles.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: If
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If it’s such an incredible
dialog: alternative why do they need a man
text: standing off to the side of the
dialog: room to make sure we all go for it?
dialog: Seems like it should be able to
dialog: sell itself.
text: Steve stutters for even a moment we can’t see it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But you’re not the man with the
dialog: answers.... So, who is? Because I
dialog: still have questions...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I can certainly try.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, good, I have questions about
dialog: Fracking water; where they put all
dialog: that water they shoot into the
dialog: ground when it comes back up? That
dialog: is highly toxic stuff. The air
dialog: pollution from the well tanks, the
dialog: potential for ground water
dialog: contamination, the deadly effect on
dialog: live stock and basically how would
dialog: we live here when this is all over?
text: Steve still somehow appears unflappable, hiding his all but
dialog: lost composure.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ... And I’m happy to answer all
dialog: those questions. There’s no such
dialog: thing as a neutral position here.
dialog: If you're against natural gas,
dialog: you’re FOR coal and oil. Unless we
dialog: talk about cutting our consumption.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 43
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: And so far that’s a conversation
dialog: none of us are willing to have.
text: Frank smiles. There’s a long pause.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Steve, I just came here to point
dialog: out that this issue is a bit more
dialog: complicated than it seems.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, you've certainly done that.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Great, so I think we should take a
dialog: vote?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Wait, what?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: In a few weeks, once everyone has
dialog: had a chance to think this whole
dialog: thing through, I think we should
dialog: put it to a vote.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: But that’s not--
text: He turns to Richards, confident this isn’t possible.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Oh for God’s sake. Frank,
dialog: unfortunately this isn’t an issue
dialog: that is in the realm of a town
dialog: vote.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Gerry, the law states it is
dialog: completely within the board’s power
dialog: to relinquish any major decision to
dialog: the will of the people... If they
dialog: so choose.
text: The crowd starts grumbling, seemingly with support for both
text: sides of the conversation.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Mr. Yates, with all do respect,
dialog: I’ve talked to a lot of folks here
dialog: who really need this. And I don’t
dialog: think anyone here is going to be
text: swayed by one man.
dialog: 44
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're right.
text: Frank looks to the crowd. There’s a long beat. Suddenly, as
text: if on cue, a swell of people begin standing up. At first
dialog: glance it would appear to be a majority of the crowd... we
dialog: now know the reason for the big turnout.
text: As they rise we see the rush of blood to Steve’s head. Off
text: to the side, Sue’s eyes are wide.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: These people and I got together to
dialog: say we strongly believe that this
dialog: is NOT in the best interest of this
dialog: town.
text: A man runs up to Richards and whispers in his ear. This is
dialog: the coach of the high school basketball team. We now see at
text: one of the doors of the gym, the team has entered and are
text: standing off to the side ready for a practice.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: Uh... Yeah... yeah, sure thing,
dialog: Stan. Go ahead.
text: The boys immediately flood into the gym and go into lay up
dialog: lines.
text: Richards turns back and tries to compose himself.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: Well, this isn’t everybody, Frank.
dialog: You know not even half the town is
dialog: here today.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Exactly! And I think all those
dialog: people would hate to be left out of
dialog: such a big decision.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: Frank--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Let’s face it, Gerry, money can
dialog: often lead to bad decisions.
dialog: You've seen the same numbers I have
dialog: and with the recent figures on the
dialog: deposits in this area at 150
dialog: million dollars, let’s all take
dialog: some time to think it through.
text: Richards looks over at Steve.
dialog: 22
dialog: 45
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: 150 million dollars?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Those are the latest numbers out of
dialog: the university.
dialog: Steve says nothing... and that says everything. This
text: registers like a freight train on Richards. He’s been duped
text: and is immediately furious! Staring straight at Steve:
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: Well 150 million dollars IS a lot
dialog: of money....
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: Let’s have a vote!
text: Steve goes to say something...
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: Say, three weeks. We’re adjourned!
text: Richards glares at Steve as he walks past him.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR RICHARDS
dialog: Asshole...
text: Time seems to have slowed down for Steve who has no idea how
text: to process what happened in the last 3 minutes. He looks
text: over at Sue who is furious.
text: The basketball team immediately rushes out around Steve, all
text: dribbling balls, as people begin to file out.
text: From up above we see Steve just standing there at half court
text: as he is completely surrounded... By this basketball team...
dialog: by this town.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. BRONCO - DRIVING - DAY 22

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Holy shit.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Holy SHIT!
dialog: 46
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Calm down, Sue.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Don’t tell me to calm down! What
dialog: was that? Stepping out on that
dialog: court? What the hell were you
dialog: thinking?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I was trying to fix things!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Bull SHIT! You didn’t want to
dialog: lose! You saw an old man beating
dialog: up on your newest investment and
dialog: you took that as some personal
dialog: slight to YOU? He was just trying
dialog: to score points on a town official,
dialog: until you played right into him and
dialog: handed him the whole game!!
dialog: “Natural gas isn’t perfect?” What
dialog: were you thinking? And what
dialog: happened with the politician?...
dialog: Why was he so pissed???
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ++. I told him the number was 30
dialog: million.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Jesus Christ! Well, once again,
dialog: you came in below the price point!
dialog: Was it worth it??
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I’m sorry, Sue....
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Steve! I don’t give a shit about
dialog: your numbers or your promotion! I
dialog: don’t! My son is in fucking
dialog: Houston with his stupid fucking
dialog: dad. I don’t give a shit about
dialog: being number one, I’m here to do a
dialog: job and go home.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I’m sorry, Sue...

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: «+. the plan is the same! But
dialog: starting now we sign EVERYONE! I
dialog: don’t care if they have 100 acres
dialog: or 1 acre. We go door to door and
dialog: we lease it all! We don’t lose.
text: Steve nods, but is obviously rattled.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Nothing's changed. They still need
dialog: the money.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL - NIGHT 23
text: Sue and Steve are in Sue’s hotel room. They are Skyping with

dialog: interviewed with.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you telling us??? Are you
dialog: telling us that we could actually
dialog: LOSE this thing?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That won’t happen. We just have to
dialog: move quickly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus Christ! Do you have any idea
dialog: what happens if this vote doesn’t
dialog: go our way? It’s like a goddamn
dialog: wildfire straight up the corridor!
dialog: (Close to hysterical) If this gets

dialog: into this? Everything changes for
dialog: us!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: DO you??? Do you have any idea how
dialog: this will play at the shareholders

dialog: A goddamn blood bath!! We’re

dialog: We've just got to do an all out

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Not a chance.
speaker_heading: SUE

dialog: scared.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (Looking to try and see)
dialog: .-. Who is that?
text: A voice off screen answers “Sue Thomason”.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Steve and I can handle this.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well we have to do SOMETHING!!!
dialog: Jesus Christ! What happened,
dialog: Steve??? You were supposed to get
dialog: in, get out! Why the hell would
dialog: you step out there and expose the
dialog: whole goddamn thing?
text: Beat. Steve looks at the screen.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It was a judgement call. I don’t
dialog: know, I guess I thought--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Sir, it’s obvious they had planned
dialog: this long in advance. The
dialog: politician was buckling, that’s
dialog: when Steve stepped in to try and
dialog: put out the fire. This Yates guy
dialog: is just a wild card.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: He’s the high school science
dialog: teacher.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, we have him pulled up
dialog: online... he’s a lot more than
dialog: that! Frank Yates. MA,
dialog: engineering, MIT. PhD from Cornell
dialog: in Physics. Jesus Christ, the guy
dialog: worked R and D for Boeing for 32
dialog: years? He retired, Steve! He's
dialog: teaching for fun!
speaker_heading: 48A
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I'll handle this, sir. This was my
dialog: mistake. It’s a setback. Nothing
dialog: more-—

dialog: 26
dialog: 27
dialog: 49
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I can have this entire town

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Give me the chance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, we've got a lot to discuss
dialog: here, Steve... I don’t think I need
dialog: to tell you how important this
dialog: is... this one’s all or nothing.
dialog: We understand each other?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ...I understand.
text: The Skype clicks off, immediately lessening the amount of

scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING 26
text: Steve walks down an oddly quiet main street. He is obviously

scene_heading: INT. DINER - MORNING 27

text: buzzing with heated debate.
speaker_heading: 49K
text: Steve walks up to the counter of the retro diner to wait for

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Uh... two.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Cream and sugar?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, thanks.
text: Lynn hands him his coffees. Steve goes to pay. She touches
text: his hand.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: No no, these are on me... Don’t you
text: worry about Frank Yates, darlin’.
dialog: We all know it’s not true.
text: She winks. Steve doesn’t know what to say.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Those folks can scream and shout
dialog: all they want... they still need
dialog: money.
text: Steve exits.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET — MORNING 28
text: As the diner door slowly closes behind Steve, the sound fades
text: into a complete silence once again. Steve walks along
text: collecting his thoughts.
text: A car is parked at the lone stop light. Steve looks up
text: casually and then looks again. The man behind the wheel
text: looks at Steve, smiling. There is a logo on the side of his
text: car that reads ‘ATHENA’. As Steve gets across the street, he

dialog: yourself seem friendly. Embarrass
dialog: yourself a bit.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: And if I do, you gonna sign your
dialog: lease?
text: She holds up a clipboard and points to his name on a list...
text: He smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. ROB’S GUNS, GROCERY, GUITARS & GAS - DAY 36
text: Sue comes out of the store. She’s smiling.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey, did you see a guy in there?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I‘1l1 let you figure out how stupid
dialog: that sounded.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I think there’s an environmental
dialog: presence here.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Cuz there was just this guy and...
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I gotta get a outfit.
text: Steve looks over, taken aback! What does that mean?
scene_heading: EXT. BUDDY'S - NIGHT 37
text: Sue has changed... not only physically, wearing an outfit
text: that is neither to fit in, nor for business, but she seems to
text: also be in a different state of mind. Steve has changed his
text: clothes too. They sit for a moment.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So is this guy handsome?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Immediately insecure) What?
dialog: 38
dialog: 58
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, you just look nice.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Scene of the crime.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Oh God, this is where you were?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So am I sitting with you?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No, I’m gonna be with Rob.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Who's Rob?
speaker_heading: SUE
text: The handsome guy.
text: Beat. Steve can see she’s nervous.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: God, the things we do--
text: Sue goes to get out of the car.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Wait!
text: Beat. Sue looks to Steve for encouragement.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What song are you gonna sing?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Oh, kiss my ass, Steve!
text: She jumps out and slams the door.
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S - NIGHT 38
text: Sue spots Rob, who waves her over. He’s got a table near the
text: stage. Steve heads to the bar.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I signed you up!
dialog: 59
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: For karaoke??
text: Rob smiles.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Yes. Drink?
text: Rob gets the attention of the waitress. She starts coming
text: over. Sue stares at the band... and the microphone standing
text: there in front of them.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Maybe get me two.
text: Rob laughs.
scene_heading: 39 INT. BUDDY’S - NIGHT 39
text: Steve stands at the bar waiting for a drink.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Am I interrupting something?
text: Steve turns to see... Alice.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey!...
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (referencing herself)
dialog: Alice.
text: Steve laughs.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Now you go. We’1ll try this again.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Steve.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Pleasure to meet you, Steve.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: So it looks like you'll be here a
dialog: lot longer than you thought.
text: Steve looks up at her.
dialog: 60
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: The town hall? Didn’t look like
dialog: that went the way you wanted it to.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah... I’m sorry I lied to you.
dialog: We were only supposed to be here 2-
dialog: 3 days.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: That’s ok. We don’t actually play
text: a game called ABSOLUT MADNESS.
text: Jesse’s shots were water.
text: Right at that moment Jesse comes and sets the dusty bottle of
text: scotch in front of Steve. He smiles at Steve. Steve is
text: totally confused.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ...What’s ABSOLUT MADNESS?
text: Alice smiles at him, knowingly. Then hands him a napkin with
text: her number on it.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: In case of emergency only.
text: She gets up to leave.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: See ya’ around, Steve. Oh, and
dialog: congratulations, you got your
text: picture on the wall.
text: She leaves. Steve stares at her, smiling... still confused.
text: Just as he’s about to call out to her... we hear a noise.
text: It’s coming from the stage. Steve quickly turns to see...
text: Sue singing ‘I SAW THE LIGHT’. She sings the lst line...
dialog: silence... she sings the second. It is not good... but
text: determined. Suddenly, the bar begins to slowly clap... only
text: politely. Steve looks to Sue, mouth agape.
text: Sue finishes to mild applause. She walks off stage to Rob.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I thought that would’ve gone
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Don’t people go to church here?
dialog: 61
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Yeah... on Sundays.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Hey look at it this way, now you
dialog: have their sympathy. They’1ll never
dialog: forget the woman who sang the Jesus
text: song at open mic night.
text: He smiles... she does not... then drains her third gin and
text: tonic. She looks back at Steve who gives her a completely
text: sarcastic thumbs up. Sue wants to kill him. Suddenly we
text: hear a voice on the mic. Steve turns to see:
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Hello? Hello? Testing. Could I
dialog: have everyone’s attention for one
dialog: second please? My name is--
text: There’s a squeak from the mic.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Whoa! Hot mic!
text: Dustin laughs. The room is dead as they all look up at him
text: quizzically. Dustin is holding a stack of leaflets.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: I uh-- I just arrived in town and
dialog: wanted to introduce myself to all
dialog: of you and uh-- Oh man, this seemed
dialog: like a much better idea when I was
text: standing in the back.
dialog: Someone yells out!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Sing something!
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: How bout this? If you give me just
dialog: 30 seconds of your time, I'll even
dialog: let you pick the song!
text: There’s a few cheers and whistles.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: My name is Dustin Noble and I work
dialog: for a small environmental group
dialog: called Athena.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 62
speaker_heading: DUSTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: We travel around the Northeast to
dialog: protect environmental habitats and
dialog: wildlife.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Boooo!
text: Steve and Sue look on a bit confused. Alice is now standing
text: by the bathroom door.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: I grew up in a small town in
dialog: Nebraska, my family was a 5th
dialog: generation farming family. Dairy.
text: There’s murmurs of frustration in the bar. This is not what
dialog: they’re here for.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: All our cows are now dead.
text: The room is quieted slightly.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: In March of 2008, my dad found 12
text: dead cows down by a creek a half a
dialog: mile from our house. By April 80%
dialog: of his herd was either sick or
dialog: dead. And by Christmas he had
dialog: defaulted on his payments and the
dialog: bank eventually took his house. 9
dialog: months. 150 years that farm was in
dialog: our family and it only took 9
dialog: months to lose it. It wasn’t just
dialog: us. 16 other farms in that county
dialog: went under. All the land just
text: died. Shrivelled up and turned
dialog: brown. Making it very easy to see
text: the only things left standing.
text: Giant green tanks that said GLOBAL.
text: The room begins to turn as people take this in. Steve and
text: Sue notice. Sue gets up and heads for the bathrooms. Steve
text: takes his cue and follows her.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: So, when I heard that you all were
dialog: going to put this to a VOTE? Well,
dialog: I had to come down here personally
dialog: and tell you my story. This isn’t
dialog: some environmentalist conspiracy.
dialog: This is my life. The simple truth
dialog: is... One day the farms were there.
dialog: 63
text: Dustin holds up the leaflets.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: And one day they weren't.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What the hell is happening right
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That’s the guy!
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: My name is Dustin Noble. I’m just
dialog: a hick from Nebraska and I’m here
dialog: for you!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: How much money do we have left? I
dialog: got this.
text: She turns and leaves. Steve stands looking on for one more
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: BRUUUCE!!
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: What’s that?
text: There are a few chuckles.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Springsteen! Sing!
text: There is a small amount of laughter. That leads to clapping.
text: Dustin looks around at the crowd.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Oh man! I don’t know about that.
dialog: That’s sort of sacred ground to--
text: The keyboard player begins to play lightly ‘DANCING IN THE
text: DARK’. Dustin turns to her.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: You gotta be kidding me!
text: The rest of the band jumps in immediately! The crowd reacts,
text: goading him more. He is screwed. Weakly he tries:
dialog: 64
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: .-. I get up in the evening. And I
dialog: ain’t got nothin’ to say.
text: The crowd cheers. Dustin smiles.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: I come home in the morning, I go to
dialog: bed feeling the same way. I ain’t
dialog: nothin’ but tired, man I’m just
dialog: tired and bored with myself. Hey
dialog: baby, I could use just a little
dialog: help.
text: Crowd joins in.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: YOU CAN'T START A FIRE, YOU CAN’T
text: START A FIRE WITHOUT A SPARK. THIS
text: GUN’S FOR HIRE EVEN IF WE’RE JUST
text: DANCING IN THE DARK.
text: Now the bar is full-on cheering Dustin on. Steve looks over
text: and sees Alice watching Dustin. He walks right up to her.
text: and takes her arm.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey, none of that stuff-- the
dialog: things he said. It’s just not
dialog: true.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I’m not a bad guy.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I don’t think you are.
text: After sharing a beat. He heads to the door, looking back at
text: Dustin. The ENTIRE bar is on their feet. People are dancing
text: and singing along. He has the entire bar in the palm of his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: They say you gotta stay hungry.
text: Dustin, in full swing, grabs a girl.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
text: HEY BABY, I’M JUST ABOUT STARVING
dialog: TONIGHT!
dialog: 40
dialog: 65
text: The place ERUPTS!!! At the door, Steve has had enough. He
text: grabs a leaflet and walks out. We stay on Dustin and the bar
dialog: for a few more moments. He is a huge hit!
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL-- PARKING LOT - NIGHT 40
text: Steve and Sue stand outside in the parking lot. Steve is
text: holding the leaflet which depicts a poorly xeroxed picture of
text: what looks to be a dead animal with gas wells in the
text: background. On the bottom in block print it reads... GLOBAL
speaker_heading: GO HOME.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: “Global go home”, what a crock of
dialog: shit.
text: Steve slaps his neck.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Can we go inside, Sue? I’m getting
dialog: eaten alive! How do you even know
dialog: he’s staying here?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Where else is he gonna stay,
dialog: Steven?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: None of that shit can be true,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Of course not! We would’ve heard
dialog: about it. They’re not going to
dialog: send us in blind.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I should have just confronted him
text: at the bar.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: In front of the whole town?... on
dialog: open mic night???
text: Dustin’s car pulls up. Sue gives a know-it-all look to Steve.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Play nice.
text: As Dustin gets out of the car, Steve walks up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey man! What’s going on?
dialog: 66
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Not much. How you doin’?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What... are... you doing here?
dialog: Athena? I’ve never even heard of
dialog: that company. What kind of name is
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: It’s Greek, originally. Athena is
dialog: the goddess of--
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Dude-- I fucking know who Athena
dialog: is!
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Ok, you just said you didn’t-- And,
dialog: I’m sorry, who are you?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You're kidding me, right? I’m
dialog: Steve!... I’m the guy you were
dialog: just talking shit about at open mic
dialog: night!
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Ah! You’re with Global.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Do you have ANY idea who you’re
dialog: dealing with? Is this some kind of
dialog: game to you? Somethin’ you and your
dialog: stoner buddies can--
text: Sue puts a hand on Steve’s arm.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: I know exactly who I’m dealing
dialog: with. I know all about your
dialog: company. I’ve seen what you do and
dialog: I know how to beat it.
dialog: 67
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh really? By telling bullshit sob
dialog: stories and singing fucking
dialog: Springsteen? You gotta be kidding
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Listen. You seem nice enough, but
dialog: I hate to tell you you’re way out
dialog: of your league, here. We’ve signed
dialog: more than enough leases to move
dialog: forward with our development.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: I wouldn’t underestimate these
dialog: people. They’re--
text: Sue steps toward him.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Trust me, they’re poor. They need
dialog: the money. I know why you think
dialog: you’re here and I admire your
dialog: commitment. But your presence here
dialog: is only going to confuse people.
text: Beat. Dustin looks up at her. She looks at him firmly. As
text: he looks back down, Sue reaches into her pocket and pulls out
text: an envelope.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: But, we do appreciate what you’re
dialog: doing and would like to make a
dialog: donation to your fine organization.
text: After a beat. Dustin takes the envelope!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We appreciate your cooperation.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Great!
text: Dustin picks up his bag and heads toward the motel.
text: Steve shares a triumphant look with Sue.
dialog: 41
dialog: 68
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: He’s actually a nice kid.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Very nice.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Just confused.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Right.
scene_heading: INT/EXT BRONCO - DRIVING - DAY Al
text: Sue and Steve are driving through town not far from the
dialog: hotel. We know this because though there is some land in
text: between, the houses are closer together. Sue sees something
text: in one of the few fields out the window. She points.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Okay. Check out the horses.
text: Sue slows down. There are three horses off in the distance.
text: Steve and Sue squint.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: They do seem small.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Next to the goats, see?
text: It’s hard to tell for sure, but standing next to a few goats,
text: the horses do look unusually small.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: They should be bigger next to the
dialog: goats.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Right???
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You're right!.... Unless the goats
dialog: are big.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: C'mon! Those goats are normal!
text: Sue starts to accelerate. Steve is beaming. Then suddenly:
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Holy shit...
dialog: 42
dialog: 69
text: In the front lawn of the upcoming house there is a sign
text: posted out front. It reads GLOBAL GO HOME. It is an
text: enlarged and slightly clearer version of Dustin’s leaflet.
text: They drive by. Both Sue and Steve seem confused. Then, a
text: few houses up, they see another one... and another one.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What’s going on?
text: Steve looks back to see the signs as they pass. As he turns
dialog: back to face front:
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Son of a bitch!
text: At that moment Steve sees, parked in the driveway of the
text: upcoming house... Dustin’s car.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Pull over. Pull over!!!
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - DAY 42
text: The Bronco pulls over to the side of the road, as Dustin
text: walks out of the house with a large sign in his hand. It is
text: a large blown up version of the leaflets he’s been handing
text: out which show a large photo of dead cattle and the words
text: GLOBAL GO HOME on the bottom. A couple waves as he walks
text: down the walkway. He is carrying a large cardboard poster
text: with him. Steve launches out of the car, trying
text: unsuccessfully to hide his fury. Dustin sees him.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: (Full volume to spite
dialog: Steve)
dialog: Hey, Steve!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (To Dustin under his
dialog: breath)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Steve gives an overly cheerful wave to the couple on the
dialog: porch.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: HELLO! (To Dustin) What the fuck
dialog: are you doing here?
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: I’m telling these people the truth.
text: Dustin sticks the sign in the ground.
dialog: 70
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We had an agreement.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Did we?
text: Dustin leans on sign. The couple looks on.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We sure as (whispers) shit did.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Well, I guess I woke up this
dialog: morning and realized I should do
dialog: what I came here to do.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You WHAT?
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Yeah, I just feel morally obligated
dialog: to stay.
text: Indicating the sign.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Oh, I put that donation to good
dialog: use! Thank you!
text: Dustin waves to Sue.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Hey Sue!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Are you fucking insane? Do you
dialog: have any idea what you’re up
dialog: against? We are a 9 billion dollar
dialog: company. Do you have any idea what
dialog: we're capable of?
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Do you?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Because all I see here is you and
dialog: me. And one of us is a lot more
text: confident than the other.
dialog: 71
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You're absolutely right, and one of
dialog: us is going to punch the other one
text: in the face.
text: The couple goes back in the house, a bit nervous. Dustin
text: looks back and watches them go then turns back to Steve,
dialog: concerned.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Steve, stop. Listen to me. You’re
dialog: doing all the things you’ve done in
dialog: the past... and they’re not
dialog: working. Why is that?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Not working? We already have 60%
dialog: of the land in this town bought and
text: paid for. It’s over.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Steve, you can buy 80% of the
dialog: land... that’s only 40% of the
dialog: vote. Wake up, Steve, we’re not
dialog: fighting for the land. We’re
dialog: fighting for the people.
text: Steve actually looks like he’s going to hit Dustin.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You son of a bitch! Do you have
dialog: any idea what you’re doing to these
dialog: people? These people need help.
dialog: We're trying to give it to them.
dialog: What the fuck are you doing?
dialog: From the truck:
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Walk away, Steve.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Your wrong, Steve. These people?
dialog: They changed. It’s not just about
dialog: the money any more.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Get in the car.
text: He pats Steve on the shoulder.
dialog: 43
dialog: 72
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Listen, none of this is your fault.
dialog: This is just your time. You're
dialog: going to lose.
text: He begins to walk to his truck.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Really? To what? What are you
dialog: selling?
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: See ya around, Steve.
text: As Dustin gets in his truck.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, let’s just run everything on
dialog: rainbows and laughter!... Dip shit.
text: Steve walks to the truck, pissed.
scene_heading: INT/EXT BRONCO - DRIVING - DAY 43
text: Steve is stewing. After a moment.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Look, we’ve dealt with this before.
dialog: We're fine.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We just have to be smart, come up
dialog: with a way to--
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Turn around.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Ok, you've GOT to stop! What are
dialog: you gonna do beat the shit out of
dialog: this guy?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Turn around, Sue.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: This is completely infantile!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Turn the car around, Sue!!!
dialog: 44
dialog: 45
dialog: 73
text: Sue goes quiet and looks at him. After a moment... she
text: begins to turn around.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY 44
text: We see the car turn around and watch it drive off down the
dialog: road.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - DAY 45
text: In a large wide shot we see Steve and Sue from behind
text: standing seemingly in the middle of nowhere. After a long
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, we've definitely got the
dialog: space.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Food and games to the left, animals
dialog: and bathrooms to the right. We
dialog: might even have room for a tractor
text: pull behind the ferris wheel back
dialog: there with the whirly... thing.
dialog: What am I missing?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Come on, Sue.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I’ve never even BEEN to a town
dialog: fair, Steve. I’m not in P.R.!
dialog: This is for the back up team.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We ARE the back up team, Sue. And
dialog: this is how we win. When I was
dialog: growing up people would talk about
dialog: the town fair for months. If we
dialog: can’t sign everyone, let’s at least
dialog: show them what its like to have
dialog: some money.
text: She looks at him as he stares off.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What am I missing?
dialog: 46
dialog: 47
dialog: 74
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ....Bouncy castles...
text: Steve smiles.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Congratulations, you just got a job
dialog: in P.R.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 46
text: Steve walks up to his room after a long day and puts the key
text: in the door. When he looks up, he sees that one of Dustin’s
text: leaflets is taped to his door.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Asshole.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - DAY 47
text: We come up on an indecipherable background. A greyish wall.
dialog: After a beat:
text: Dustin enters from out of frame as we pull out to reveal... a
dialog: black board.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Good morning, everyone! My name is
dialog: Dustin!
text: We immediately reveal... a classroom of kids.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: HI DUSTIN!!!
text: As we pull out more we see that in front of him is a brown
text: bag of unknown supplies and on the floor is a large box.
text: He’s talking to Alice’s 5th grade class. She stands off to
text: the side, admiring.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: How many of you live on a farm?
text: Almost all the hands go up.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Alright!
text: From behind the desk he pulls up a large clear bag full of
text: dirt and places it on the table. He then reaches into the
text: bag and pulls out a few toy figures of cows and horses.
speaker_heading: 7T4A
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Now, let’s say THIS is your farm!
speaker_heading: 5TH GRADER
dialog: That’s a bag of dirt!
dialog: 48
dialog: 49
dialog: 75
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: I know, I know! Geesh! Thought
dialog: 5th graders were supposed to have
dialog: imaginations. (He smiles) Ok, how
dialog: about this!
text: He picks up a pencil and waves it over the bag of dirt.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: In Spectro Peculium! Poof! Now
dialog: it’s a farm! Ok?
dialog: The kids laugh!
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Whew! Thank God for Harry Potter!
text: We see that one of the children laughing is... Carson Allen.
dialog: Claire’s son.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL HOUSE - DAY 48
text: Steve is standing on a porch waiting. The door finally opens
text: and a large man stands inside the screen door.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey there! My name is Steve Butler
dialog: and--
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: I know who you are. You outta be
dialog: ashamed of yourself.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Look, the information you're
dialog: getting from this ATHENA guy is not
dialog: true. If you look at--
text: The large man slams the door.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 49
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: And this...
text: From behind the desk he pulls up a big clear Tupperware
text: container and pours in a large bottle of water.
dialog: 76
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: And THIS is all the water in town!
dialog: The water you drink, the water the
dialog: cows drink, the water your puppies
dialog: and kittens drink and all the water
dialog: in the river for the fish.
text: Alice looks at him warily, a bit perplexed.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Now let me show you what happened
dialog: one day in my home town, in a state
dialog: called Nebraska, when this company
dialog: GLOBAL, tried drilling for Natural
dialog: gas.
text: He holds the bag over the container of water. Suddenly he
text: begins puncturing the bottom of the bag with a pencil.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: See, they wanted to drill into the
dialog: land, like this.
text: The kids laugh at the rather destructive action. Little bits
text: of dirt start falling into the water.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: But unfortunately they don’t just
dialog: use a drill like the ones some of
dialog: your daddies have. No, they use
dialog: ones that shoot water and sand!
text: Dustin takes a sports bottle and begins to shoot water into
text: the bag of dirt. After a moment the bag begins dripping
text: dirty water out of the bottom. The kids cheer!
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: But hold on, hold on! That’s not
dialog: all! In order to do all that
dialog: drilling they need to use...
text: From the brown paper bag he pulls out 5 or 6 bottles of home
dialog: cleaning products, etc.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Chemicals! Now these chemicals
dialog: that they use seem harmless when
dialog: they’re contained right? In fact a
dialog: lot of the bad stuff up there you
dialog: can find right here in the bottles
dialog: under your sink at home. But they
dialog: don’t use one chemical at a time.
dialog: They use all of them.
dialog: 50
dialog: 51
dialog: 77
text: Dustin starts to pour all the products into the bag. Alice
text: pulls away a little from the smell. After a moment a gross
text: concoction of dark ooze starts dripping from the bag.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: Ewwwww!
text: They’re all a bit horrified.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY 50
text: Sue and Steve walk to the Bronco not paying attention. When
text: they get in Steve looks up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: God DAMN IT!!!
text: The windshield is covered in the Athena leaflets with the
text: photo of the dead cows and GLOBAL GO HOME written on them.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE AND TRAILER - DAY 51
text: Steve exits a house saying goodbye to the older couple.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, I appreciate your time. If
dialog: you change your mind, you let me
dialog: know.
text: They shake hands and smile. Steve walks down the walkway
text: disappointed. Suddenly he hears a voice.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: There he is!
text: Steve looks around and sees a man in his late 20’s sitting on
text: the porch of a neighboring trailer. He waves.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey!
text: Steve keeps walking.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I’ve been waitin’ on you folks!
text: Steve looks up at him.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Uh... Well, unfortunately I don’t
dialog: think you’re, uh--
dialog: 52
dialog: 53
dialog: 78
text: Steve looks into his folder.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Paul Geary. 442 Henley.
text: On Steve’s list it is clear this man’s land is unusable. It
text: is listed at only 2 acres, which isn’t big enough to house a
text: well. Steve clears his throat.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh, yup! There you are Mr. Geary,
dialog: I apologize.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No worries. Come on in, come on
dialog: in! Where do I sign?
text: Steve smiles. As he walks to the trailer his smile fades.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 52
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Now...
text: He reaches into the box and pulls out a lighter. A few
dialog: gasps.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: Whoa.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Oh, I don’t think--
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: It’s ok.
text: Dustin lowers the lighter to the discolored water. After a
text: moment it IGNITES! Then burns gently.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: WHOA! ! I!!!
text: They all cheer.
scene_heading: EXT. GEARY’S TRAILER - DAY 53
text: Steve is trying to leave. The door is open. We can see down
text: the walkway... where Sue is standing. She gestures “What the
dialog: hell?”
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, thanks again for your time.
dialog: 79
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You didn’t even finish your coffee!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh man, if I had any more, I'd
dialog: bounce out of here. But thank you!
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Whoo! No, sir, thank YOU! You
dialog: folks are doin’ a good thing here.
dialog: We sure need the helpin’ hand.
text: Steve feels a little sick.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Alright!
text: Steve turns to the street where he can see Sue waiting in the
text: neighbor's driveway next door.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey, Steve! You got a good
dialog: feelin’?
text: Steve turns.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This well. You think it’ll be a
dialog: gusher? Do they even call ita
dialog: gusher?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, Paul there’s no way to tell
dialog: til we do some tests--
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: But just your gut! Whatdaya think?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I think you seem like a lucky guy.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Whoo! Alright, well come back
dialog: whenever with that contract!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Alright.
text: Paul goes back inside. After a moment’s pause:
dialog: 80
scene_heading: 54 INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 54
text: The kids are cheering.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Why are you cheering?
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: It’s so cool!
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: But that’s the water you drink.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: Oh yeah./ I guess.
text: Needing a big finish, Dustin looks around the room and
text: sees... on the windowsill is an aquarium. Inside is a very
dialog: unlucky turtle.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: What’s the turtle’s name?
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: Trigger!
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Does his water look like it’s as
dialog: clean as this water?
text: A few kids answer quietly...
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: No. No way.
text: Silence. In a flash, Dustin has pulled the turtle out and is
text: back in front of the flames..
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Well, let’s see if Trigger here can
dialog: survive in his new home.
text: BLOOD CURDLING SCREAMS FROM THE KIDS!!... and Alice.
text: Dustin stops. He’s given the greatest presentation ever.
scene_heading: 55 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 55
text: The kids are filing out. They all high five Dustin! Dustin
text: gives them all sticker versions of the leaflet on the way
dialog: out.
dialog: 81
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Stick these anywhere you can! Get
dialog: in trouble!
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Absolutely not! Wow, that was
dialog: great! So vivid.
text: Dustin smiles, joking.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: I am good!
text: Alice and Dustin laugh. A moment. The bell rings.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Well, thanks again.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: No, thank you!
text: They shake hands.
text: He turns and runs down the hall. Alice watches him go.
text: Suddenly we realize that a group of kindergartners have been
text: coming down the hall, all led by their teacher... Gwen. As
text: she walks by with the train of children she stares after
dialog: Dustin too.
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: Goddamn it! It’s your birthday
dialog: everyday, isn’t it?
scene_heading: 56 INT/EXT BRONCO - GEARY’S TRAILER - DAY 56
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Let’s just go.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: How much land does he have?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: 1.8 acres.
text: Sue looks over. She knows what this means.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: How much?
dialog: 57
dialog: 82
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: 5000...
text: Sue looks back at the house.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And told him 15%.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Chuckles)
dialog: That’s funny. Smart.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Let’s just go.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Listen, that’s five grand free for
dialog: that guy!
text: Sue goes to start the car, it doesn’t turn over again.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Don’t say anything!
text: Steve still looking out the window, isn’t even paying
text: attention. They drive away.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL FARM - AFTERNOON 57
text: Steve knocks on a door. After a moment we reveal... Alice.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Well, hello.
text: Alice smiles.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey!
text: Steve smiles. Long moment where the two wait to see what
text: this is. Steve smiles.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Are you the owner of this farm?...
dialog: Are youuuu-- Alice Neary?
text: Steve holds up a clipboard and points to her name. Reaction
text: from Alice as her heart falls for a moment. Steve’s here to
text: pitch. She hides her disappointment valiantly.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Yes I am.
dialog: 58
dialog: 83
scene_heading: EXT. ALICE’S HOUSE - LATE DAY 58
text: We are wide as we see look out on an INCREDIBLLY beautiful
text: vista in the perfect light of early evening. This is the
text: land behind Alice’s house. Alice sits on a small bench right
text: at the top overlooking the view. Steve stands giving an
text: energetic pitch to Alice. We can very softly hear the sound
dialog: of running water.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: See you can tuck the wells in down
text: behind that group of trees to the
dialog: right.
text: Steve looks at an aerial photograph on his clipboard of
dialog: Alice’s land.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And because of the way your
dialog: property is laid out we could put
text: an access road clear on the other
dialog: side so you wouldn’t even hear the
dialog: trucks.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (Jokingly)
dialog: And we could actually put the cash
dialog: machine right next to the couch I
dialog: slept on.
text: Alice smiles.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: This farm has been in my family for
dialog: over one hundred years.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Exactly, and this money will keep
dialog: it in your family for another
dialog: hundred. You wouldn’t see any of
dialog: this from the house!
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: .-. But I’d see it from here.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Look, you don’t have to decide now.
dialog: Think about it.
text: Beat. Steve turns to her.
speaker_heading: 58A
speaker_heading: 58B
speaker_heading: 58C
speaker_heading: 58D
dialog: 84
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: I can always come back.
text: He smiles. She smiles. They both know what this is.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Yeah, cuz you’re gonna be around
dialog: for a bit!
text: Steve laughs. They look out at the land. We hold on the two
dialog: of them... a second too long.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL - STEVE’S ROOM —- MORNING 58A
text: The clock reads 4:30 am. Steve is awake. After a beat he
text: gets up and walks out of frame.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL - STEVE’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 58B
text: Mirroring the first shot of the movie in the restaurant
text: bathroom, Steve comes up into frame splashing water on his
text: face. He looks at himself in the mirror.
scene_heading: EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - EARLY DAWN 58C
text: Steve walks into frame carrying a pile of lumber. He drops
text: them down. Takes a second to look out over the land and then
text: picks up a shovel and walks out a few feet and begins to dig.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - MORNING 58D
text: Steve is once again at the coffee counter of the retro diner.
text: There is dirt on his clothes as he waits. Lynn comes up and
text: hands him his coffee. Is her energy different? She doesn’t
text: even look up at Steve.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Two dollars.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Thanks, Lynn.
text: She won’t even look at him. Steve follows her as she walks
text: back to join a group that sits by the counter.
dialog: 59
dialog: 85
text: He looks down the bar and sees Dustin sitting with a bunch of
text: people telling a story. He sees Steve and waves. Off
text: Steve’s face.
scene_heading: EXT. DENNON’S FARM — DAY 59
text: Next to a small dilapidated house is a beautiful expanse of
text: land with a stream running through it. Steve stands by a
text: fence with a man. This is Jeff Dennon, mid thirties. He is
text: repairing a part of the fence that keeps the animals out of
text: the stream. Suddenly Steve grabs one of the fence poles and
text: helps Jeff. Steve’s ability is completely second nature.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We send more than one BILLION
dialog: dollars overseas every DAY to fuel
dialog: our need for oil. Now that’s just
dialog: insane. To be spending so much
dialog: money to buy oil? FIGHTING for so
dialog: much oil? When we have one of the
dialog: largest natural energy sources
dialog: right here in our back yard! Now
dialog: this guy from Athena’s going around
dialog: lying to everybody and--
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Mr. Butler, you seem like a good
dialog: enough man so I’m going to be
dialog: straight with you so as to not
dialog: waste your time... That little boy
dialog: you saw when you came to the door?
text: Steve nods.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: He lost his father, my brother, 6
dialog: years ago in Fallujah... So you
dialog: don’t need to lecture me on the
dialog: whole foreign oil dependency
dialog: routine. But let me ask you one
dialog: question, Steve. If I do this...
dialog: what do I say to that boy? What am
dialog: I telling him? What am I telling
dialog: him about this farm that my daddy
dialog: gave me and his daddy gave him?
dialog: What am I telling him about what
dialog: his daddy went to the desert to
dialog: fight for? See, you and I both
dialog: know that the only reason you’re
dialog: here, is because we're poor.
text: Steve doesn’t respond.
dialog: 60
dialog: 86
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: How many wells you got up near
dialog: Manhattan? What about
dialog: Philadelphia? Or Pittsburgh?
text: Steve still says nothing.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: It’s alright. I get it. That's
dialog: what we’re here for. Nothin’ new.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: But, you’ll never get what you came
dialog: here to take from me... and to be
dialog: honest, I don’t even like the fact
dialog: that you’re here trying.
text: Off Steve’s look.
scene_heading: EXT. FAIR GROUNDS - DAY 60
text: Steve works in the hot sun bringing bails of hay from the
text: back of the Bronco and stacking them. He makes it look
text: effortless. We finally see the farmer he once was. Where
text: he’s stacking them we see several fully built animal pens.
text: There’s a mule in one of them. A large cart next to it. Sue
text: arrives carrying a lemonade.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I’ve only been handing out flyers
dialog: for like two hours and I want to
dialog: die. I don’t know how that Athena
dialog: guy does it. (Noticing Steve’s
dialog: progress!) Oh my God! How’d you
dialog: do all this? Is that a donkey?
text: Steve begins to walk through the area he has just set up.
text: Sue follows.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: A mule, yeah, the guy down the
dialog: street let me borrow him to help
text: dig out the course.
dialog: 61
dialog: 87
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What course?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Pig races.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I don't like that you said that
text: without even a smile.
text: Beat. Steve has arrived at a little well. He expertly hand
text: pumps some water to splash water on his face. He then takes
text: a long drink.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah... I’m just sick of this shit.
dialog: This thing will close them. Let’s
dialog: end this and get the hell out of
dialog: here.
text: Sue pauses for a second, seeing his change.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Alright, then.
text: Suddenly a pick up truck pulls up with two men in the front
text: and 4 men in the back. They get out and walk up. The
dialog: driver... is Rob.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Thought you could use a little
dialog: help.
text: Steve is taken aback.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Uh, yeah-- Yes. Thank you. You
dialog: could work on putting up those food
dialog: tents.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: You got it. Let’s go.
text: The men walk past. Sue looks at Steve and smiles.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL - STEVE’S ROOM - MORNING 61
text: Steve finishes up getting ready and goes to head out the
text: door. He looks back to see if he’s left anything as he opens
text: the door. When he turns back to leave...
dialog: 62
dialog: 63
dialog: 64
dialog: 88
text: He runs right into what seems like a wall. As he steps back
text: we realize what it is... Like a college dorm prank, Dustin
text: has stapled a huge version of the poster across Steve's
dialog: entire door. Steve has finally had it!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: God DAMN it!!!!
text: Without even looking at it, grabs the poster and, as if ina
text: street fight, wrestles with it, finally ripping it down the
text: middle. Sadly exhausted, Steve throws the crumpled and bent
text: pieces of poster into his room. Furious, he leaves and slams
dialog: the door!
scene_heading: EXT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE - PORCH - DAY 62
text: Sue sits on the front porch with Claire Allen. She is
text: signing a lease. In the yard in front of them, Carson is
text: throwing a baseball with a friend. They are both wearing
text: their homemade baseball t-shirts. Sue watches them.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Is that it?
text: Sue snaps out of it.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: That’s it!
text: Claire puts her hand on Sue’s.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ... thank you.
text: Sue takes this in and smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. FAIR GROUNDS - DAY 63
text: The work site is buzzing. There is now a large group of
text: people working together to help Steve. Without any
text: hesitation Steve unloads horses out of a truck, raises tents
text: with several other people, puts up fencing for the pens. All
text: the while he is... happy. We see now that he is completely
text: in his element.
scene_heading: EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY 64
text: Sue is sitting in the stands of a little league baseball
text: game. Close on her, we can see that there is something
text: different about her. She is completely at ease... almost
text: like she’s somewhere else. Suddenly she begins clapping.
dialog: 65
dialog: 66
dialog: 89
text: We pull out to reveal that there is a change of innings
text: happening. Sue is sitting on the right field line. As one
text: team heads towards Sue, the team from the opposite dugout is
text: taking the field. We track the boy heading towards first
text: base. As he comes closer we realize... it is Carson Allen...
text: we can now see his shirt.... A brand new YANKEES jersey
text: professionally done. He finally reaches first base and turns
text: back to the field. On the back of his shirt we see the
text: number ‘15’ and above that?.... GLOBAL written in bold
dialog: letters.
scene_heading: INT. GEARY’S TRAILER - DAY 65
text: Steve sits with Paul Geary. Paul finishes signing the final
text: page in a flourishing last signature. He laughs out loud and
text: looks across the table to Steve. Then suddenly he jumps up
text: and heads to a cabinet under the sink and pulls out a bottle
dialog: that’s only a third full.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: For special occasions!
text: He pours into 2 cheap, non matching, glasses and hands one to
text: Steve and clinks his glass. As Paul laughs in celebration,
text: Steve finally laughs too. It’s genuine. Paul’s energy is
dialog: infectious.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN FAIR - DAY 66
text: The fair is now nearly complete, there are pigs in the pen,
text: food tents are up, even the ferris wheel is up. It looks
text: great. Steve is now covered in dirt and sweat. He is
text: directing several people where to put the port-a-potties, as
text: SUE walks up sipping on a lemonade. Steve looks at her
dialog: drinking.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Again with the lemonade?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You don’t understand, it’s insane!
text: Steve looks behind Sue. On the sidewalk is an 11 year old
text: girl at a lemonade stand.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Jesus, she’s everywhere.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Well... Everywhere the people are,
dialog: Steve.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 90
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: She’s a little raging capitalist...
dialog: You should hire her now, while you
dialog: can afford her.
text: Sue smiles.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It’s weird that you crack yourself
dialog: up.
text: Suddenly Steve sees something.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Holy Shit...
text: Walking up to Steve... is Frank Yates.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is a great idea, Steve. Lotta
dialog: people looking forward to this.
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What are you doing here, Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thought you could use some help.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: This-- Look at the signs, Frank.
dialog: This whole thing is sponsored by
dialog: Global.
text: Steve points to signs hanging over the various areas of the
dialog: fair.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s still a town fair, Steve...
dialog: I’m not a communist. Now, where do
dialog: you need me?
dialog: Long beat.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Wanna help blow up the bouncy
dialog: castles?
text: Steve points him in a direction of the bouncy castles.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sounds good.
dialog: 67
dialog: 68
dialog: 91
text: He walks away as Sue and Steve just stand awestruck.
scene_heading: EXT. PICK-UP TRUCK/ROAD INTO TOWN - DUSK 67
text: Similar to the first introduction to the town, we follow a
text: pick up truck full of people as it drives down the road.
text: There are 3 people jammed in the front and a whole bunch
text: packed in the back. We pan through all the tired and dirty
text: faces and then come upon... Steve. We hold on the whole
text: group laughing about something and then hold as we watch the
text: truck turn down main street.
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S - NIGHT 68
text: The entire team working on the fair walks in and takes a seat
text: in a group. Steve takes a head count and then walks to the
text: bar. Jesse comes over.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey, Jesse. We’ll start with a
dialog: couple pitchers, just leave the tab
dialog: open.
text: Jesse walks away as Steve wipes his face with a bar napkin.
text: He is... happy. Suddenly:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Nice work, Steve.
text: Steve turns to reveal... Dustin.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: The fair idea was... smart.
text: Steve looks at Dustin.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, thanks Dustin, I’m sure that
dialog: was hard for you to say.
text: Beat. Dustin stares at Steve.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: You like this job, Steve?
text: Steve looks over.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: You love what you do?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: On days like this I do.
speaker_heading: 91A
text: Jesse, holding 2 pitchers of beer in two hands puts them on
dialog: the bar.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And buy him a round on me. One of
dialog: those fancy imported ones... anda
dialog: granola bar if you have it!
text: Dustin smiles and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: .+-You think you have what it
dialog: takes, Steve?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: To beat you? Absolutely.
text: Dustin smiles.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Who know’s? You just might...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 92
speaker_heading: DUSTIN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I’1l drink to that!
text: He raises his pitchers and cheers’ Dustin. Dustin smiles and
text: takes a swig. Suddenly, we hear the door open. Both Dustin
text: and Steve turn to see... Alice. She stops in her tracks.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: You ready to go?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Steve just stands there trying to process.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Thanks again for the beer, Steve.
dialog: Was really sweet. I’11 take it to
dialog: go!
dialog: 93
text: Dustin gets up and walks to Alice who still looks
text: uncomfortably to Steve.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: You guys have a great night!
text: Dustin and Alice start to walk. Alice turns back to Steve.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Hey, I’m looking forward to the
dialog: fair tomorrow... should be fun.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: ‘Night.
text: They walk off. We hold on Steve who is still frozen, holding
text: his pitchers like a jackass.
scene_heading: 69 INT. MOTEL - SUE’S ROOM - NIGHT 69
text: Sue sits on the bed. She is Skyping with her son. She’s
text: putting on a happy face, but something is hurting. There is
text: a commotion on the other end of the computer.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Well, I don’t know what to say. A
dialog: no hitter?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It was only 2 innings.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I don’t care! Did anyone get on
dialog: base?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: --. No.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Then that’s actually a perfect
dialog: game! That’s amazing!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It’s not the whole game, Mom.
text: From the other side we hear other kids’ voices yelling “COME
dialog: ON Danny!”
dialog: 94
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Well, you shouldn’t be on the
dialog: computer with me!
text: Suddenly another kid’s face pops into the frame.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Hey MS. T!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Hi, Colin!
text: The boy disappears.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Ok, go, go! Where you guys headed
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don’t know... Sarah Dayton’s
dialog: having a party I think.
text: Sue is trying her best to keep it together.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: «+. you look really nice.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I love you very much.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Ok, mom.
text: Long beat. Then, with a wave, he’s gone. Sue just stares at
text: the remaining glow on the screen.
scene_heading: 70 EXT. BUDDY'S - NIGHT 70
text: Steve exits the bar... a little drunk. There is a giant man
text: finishing a cigarette outside. Steve takes a deep breath.

dialog: 95
text: He looks back up to the sky. Suddenly a car pulls up in
text: front. It’s a brand new Corvette. The lights blind Steve,
text: then go off. A door opens and we hear:
speaker_heading: VOICE
speaker_heading: STEVE!
text: Steve squints to see who it is as his eyes adjust. It’s Paul
dialog: Geary.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It’s Paul!
text: Steve can’t believe what he’s seeing.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Is that your car, Paul?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yes sir! Picked it up over in
dialog: Barton 2 days ago! Isn't it
dialog: beautiful? Figured I’d treat
dialog: myself! Right???
text: He laughs. Steve is horrified... He tries to make
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Is that... What is that color?
dialog: Champagne?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Haha! No sir! That’s why I had to
dialog: go all the way to Barton. That
dialog: there is a very special color.
dialog: They call it Gold Mist!
text: Steve is speechless.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Whatchu drinkin’, scotch? I’m
dialog: buyin’!
text: As he heads inside. Steve stands staring at the car looking
dialog: like he could be sick.
scene_heading: INT. BUDDY'S -- LATER THAT NIGHT 71
text: It's late. Paul is gone. Only a few people remain in the
text: bar. Steve sits staring off into space it seems.
text: After a moment we here a loud voice yell:
dialog: 96
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hey!
text: Steve spins in his stool and through blurred vision sees the
text: source of the noise. 4 men, obviously farmers sit at a
text: nearby table... One of them is Jeff Dennon, the man whose
text: brother died in Fallujah. Steve looks away.
speaker_heading: JEFF
speaker_heading: HEY!
text: Steve doesn’t turn.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I just heard you’re a-- someone
dialog: told me you’re from Iowa?...
text: Steve doesn’t react.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: And your daddy he was-- your
dialog: daddy's a farmer!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ... Grandfather.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Doesn’t matter.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Now lemme aska... how do you sleep
dialog: at night?
text: Steve turns slowly, un-fazed.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: No, I wanna know. How’s it that
dialog: you come through these towns. You
dialog: seen these places, you seen these
dialog: people. You look ‘em right in the
dialog: eye... And you sell this shit.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You know it. Oh, you know all
dialog: about it. The gas... the water...
dialog: the poison. You know it ALL. And
dialog: you bring it right to us, you put
dialog: it right in our faces and say
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 97
speaker_heading: JEFF (CONT'D)
dialog: And the worst part, the WORST part
dialog: is you ain’t some slick suit
dialog: wearin’ city shark. No sir... you
dialog: know these people. You seen these

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: «+. it’s not true.
text: Steve looks away.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Look at me.
dialog: Steve doesn’t.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I said look at me.
dialog: Steve does.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: I want you to look me right in the

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: --Right in the eye.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: --when you do it. Yeah, I want you
dialog: to see me when you do it. DoTI
dialog: look like your daddy? You gonna
dialog: sell this shit to your daddy--
text: Steve looks away. And laughs. All the farmers now stand up
text: and move toward Steve.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: You have somethin’ to say?
text: Beat. Tensions are high. Steve turns to them finally.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You people baffle me... How you
dialog: just don’t get it.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Well, why don’t you explain it to
dialog: us. What the hell are we missin’
dialog: here?
dialog: 98
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Money. And I’m not talking about
dialog: little pay increases. I’m talking
dialog: about “Fuck you” money.
text: Some of the men shift their weight but say nothing.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Don’t want to apply for college
dialog: loans for your kids? This money
dialog: says “Fuck you”, loans. You worried
dialog: about car payments? “Fuck you”,
dialog: payments. The bank’s gonna forclose
dialog: on your family farm? “Fuck you”,
dialog: bank. “Fuck you” money is the
dialog: ultimate liberator. And underneath
dialog: this town is “fuck you” money. You
dialog: think long and hard about all those
dialog: brutal days workin’. And the
dialog: bullshit checks you get from
dialog: whatever goddamn frozen peas
dialog: company that’s buying. You think
dialog: about how much you made on your
dialog: best day... and then you think real
dialog: hard about how much you made on
dialog: your worst. Cuz let’s be real
dialog: honest with each other, they’re all
dialog: starting to look like that more and
dialog: more aren’t they? These people?
dialog: This town? This life? It’s dying
dialog: and damn near dead. And you all
dialog: see it coming! And you just won't
dialog: get the hell out of the way.
dialog: Why??? Pride? Of WHAT??? What
dialog: have you got? And for fuck’s sake,
dialog: how much of it is even yours???
dialog: Hell, I bet all four of you are
dialog: collecting subsidy checks from the
dialog: government. Well, when they stop
dialog: comin’? When all that help stops
dialog: comin’ and you've got nowhere to
dialog: go? You'll remember this
dialog: conversation and remember the guy
dialog: who looked you right in the eye and
dialog: said “Fuck you”.
text: In a flash the biggest, quietest farmer walks forward and
text: punches Steve in the face, immediately dropping him to the
text: ground. We see it’s the LARGE MAN that shut the door on
text: Steve earlier. The farmers stand over him and we can see
dialog: they’re furious... but they also listened. It’s intense.
speaker_heading: LARGE MAN
dialog: You’re an asshole.
speaker_heading: 71A
dialog: 99
text: The farmers walk out. Slowly Steve gets up and sits back in
text: his chair. He takes a deep breath. For the first time we
text: see what Steve has been staring at before the Farmers came
text: over to him...
text: Behind the bar, under all the bottles he notices a series of
text: Polaroid pictures lined up. Above the pictures is written in
text: big glittery letters “ABSOLUT MADNESS”. At the end of the
text: row of pictures... is Steve. For the first time we get a
text: glimpse into the horror that was Steve’s first night in town.
text: In the picture, Steve is ruddy faced and sweating... he
text: almost doesn’t look human. He’s in mid-scream and holds up
text: his hands in metal-fan fashion, fingers posed in the shape of
text: horns. He looks ridiculous... but in his head... he looks
text: awesome. Underneath each picture is the name of a state or
dialog: city. Under Steve’s it says ‘IOWA’
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL - STEVE’S ROOM - NIGHT 71A
text: Steve sits on the bed staring off. We hold on him as he
text: contemplates what just happened... and what is happening.
text: Suddenly the phone rings. He looks over to it quickly. It
text: rings again... he picks it up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: «+. Alice?
speaker_heading: SUE (0.S.)
dialog: No, but our rooms connect if you’re
dialog: that desperate.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Jesus, Sue...
speaker_heading: SUE (0.S)
dialog: Just wanted to make sure you were
dialog: behaving. Tomorrow's a big day.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, I got it.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Get some sleep, Steven.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Ok, I got it!
speaker_heading: SUE

speaker_heading: YEAH?

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Great job...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: «..You too.
text: Steve hangs up.
text: As Steve stares, we hear the pre-lap of thunder.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN FAIR - AFTERNOON 72
text: Rain pours down on the town fair... Lights have fallen and
text: dangle over the ground. The bouncy castles are half
text: deflated. The banner at the front is heavy with water as the
text: ink runs off.
text: Across the street, we see Sue and Steve’s Bronco.
scene_heading: INT. BRONCO - AFTERNOON 73
text: Steve is sitting in the passenger seat. He and Sue stare
text: silently out at the wreckage, illuminated by the headlights.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ..-We lost.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Let's go.
text: Steve stares a moment longer. Sue turns the key... the truck
text: is dead. Sue leans back and sighs.
text: Suddenly Steve reaches over and turns the key again... and
text: one more time holding the key through a horrible sound. The
text: truck is dead.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Stop.
text: He doesn’t let go.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Steve! Stop!
text: Steve begins turning the key over and over furiously. Then
text: he begins punching the steering wheel, until finally... he
text: screams and jumps out of the truck.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: FUUUUUUUUUUCK! !!
dialog: 74
dialog: 101
text: He begins kicking the truck over and over until he’s
text: exhausted. He just stands in the middle of the street in the
text: dim glow of the headlights. Sue stares at him from inside.
text: She says nothing.
text: Suddenly headlights come up on Steve standing in the rain
text: getting soaked. He looks over. A car stops in front of him
text: and the window rolls down to reveal... Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nice day!
scene_heading: INT. FRANK YATES’ HOUSE -- LATE DAY 74
text: Sue and Steve sit at the kitchen table with Frank and his
text: wife Arlene. They’re finishing a warm and hearty meal --
text: turkey, potatoes, salad, homemade cranberry sauce, carrot
text: cake. The red wine has been flowing, too... most of it going
text: to Steve. He seems a bit dark.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: God! That was so good.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Really nice. Thank you.
speaker_heading: ARLENE
dialog: You’re more than welcome.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I have to get the recipe for those
dialog: potatoes, Arlene.
speaker_heading: ARLENE
dialog: Of course! You cook, Sue?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I do. My son and I-- well, I make
dialog: him help me.
text: Sue pulls out her iPhone and shows her a picture.
speaker_heading: SUE
text: He used to stand on a chair next to
dialog: me, but now he’s so tall. He likes
dialog: cutting things, vegetables and all
dialog: that. That’s how I get him to talk -
dialog: - stand side by side, you know,
dialog: working on something.
text: Steve’s eating the last of the carrot cake.
dialog: 102
speaker_heading: ARLENE
dialog: So your husband watches him while
dialog: you’re traveling for work?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: My ex-husband watches him, yes,
dialog: while I agonize.
speaker_heading: ARLENE
dialog: (getting up, clearing
dialog: dishes)
dialog: Divorce is a monster. You just have
dialog: to work double-hard, I imagine.
dialog: Frank's father died when he was
dialog: only 8. His mother always talked
dialog: about the clarity of purpose. How
dialog: helpful that was. There’s just you
dialog: and the kid... nothing else. You
dialog: know exactly what you have to do
dialog: every day.
text: Sue’s eyes reflect absolute recognition. Frank hasn’t taken
text: his eyes off Steve... who is fairly drunk already. As Frank
text: talks we begin to push in on Steve.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What about you Steve? Where did
dialog: you say you were from? Iowa?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Eldridge.
speaker_heading: ARLENE
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: Oh yeah? Any family still up
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: «e+. No.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wait a minute did you say Eldridge?
dialog: Didn't they have a-- a plant up
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: Caterpillar plant.
text: Steve nods. He’s in his own world.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, that’s right. Had a friend
dialog: from Boeing who was from there. I
dialog: remember that. Wasn’t pretty.
dialog: 103
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: When they closed it, that was
dialog: it.... The town was hollowed out.
text: Sue looks at Steve. If she’s heard this information before,
text: it’s never revealed Steve in quite the same way.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What, and no pretty lady to hand
dialog: out free money and save you?
text: Sue smiles... a half smile. Steve doesn’t respond.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yeah, Steve, and what if there had
dialog: been?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (Quiet)
dialog: I'd move so fuckin’ fast.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I’d take that money and leave...
dialog: (Pointed) Just leave.
text: The room is silenced. After a beat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Gently)
dialog: ... And where would we all go?
text: This lands on Steve. He says nothing. The room says
text: nothing. Suddenly Steve excuses himself and walks out onto
text: the back deck. The other three just remain seated.
scene_heading: 75 EXT. FRANK YATES’ PORCH (MOMENTS LATER) - LATE DAY 75
text: Steve stands looking over the rail of the porch onto the
text: expansive land behind Frank’s house. In the dwindling light
text: it is not only beautiful... it’s close to perfect. After a
text: long moment Frank exits the house carrying 2 cups of coffee.
text: Steve is staring intently at something. As Frank joins
dialog: Steve, we finally get to see what he’s looking at... It’s a
text: horse, perfectly proportioned but very small, standing out by
text: Frank’s barn.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Miniature horse.
dialog: 104
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh my God, we thought we were
dialog: losing our minds. We kept seeing
dialog: them from a distance, and couldn’t
dialog: tell -- it was altering our whole
dialog: sense of perspective.
text: The horse grazes on a bale of hay. A dog sits nearby.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A lot us breed them. They eat like
dialog: rhinos. Some people think they’re
dialog: some kind of abomination. Big
dialog: industry up here.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What do they get for ‘em?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not enough, Steve.
text: Steve finally smiles. Frank smiles with him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You’re a good man, Steve.
text: Steve looks over. Frank continues looking out.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You have so many of the qualities
dialog: we need more of these days.
text: Steve doesn’t know what to say.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I just wish you weren’t doing this.
text: This hits Steve like a brick. He looks at Frank, perhaps to
text: say something... but is completely disarmed.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know, I used to work up at
dialog: some stables just north of here.
dialog: They used to have a poker game
dialog: every Friday night, the farm hands
dialog: and the stable boys. One of the
dialog: favorite stories in town was the
dialog: night I took 50 dollars from the
dialog: owner, Russ Clayborn. I had raised
dialog: him 20 dollars. And scared him
dialog: into folding a full house. That
dialog: was 2 weeks pay!

dialog: I was 18 years old and I ran all
dialog: the way home holding three months
dialog: of our mortgage. I was so damn
text: proud. (Frank chuckles. Steve
dialog: smiles.) I ran into the house,
dialog: threw the money on the kitchen
dialog: table and told my mom I bet
text: everything on a pair of 3’s and
dialog: won.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She took one look at the money...
dialog: and kicked me out of the house.
dialog: Had to stay at my aunt’s for a
dialog: week... When I asked her why she
dialog: just said “You could have lost”.
text: Steve looks over at Frank, but says nothing.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: In those days it was harder to find
dialog: aman that was willing to bet it
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We have nothing left to sell and we
dialog: can't afford to buy anything. You
dialog: came here to help us. Offer us
dialog: money... All we had to do to get it
dialog: was be willing to scorch the earth
dialog: under our feet.
text: Neither man says anything.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don’t get me wrong, Steve, I’m not
dialog: better than my neighbors -- hell, I
dialog: need the money too.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Chuckles)
dialog: I guess I’m just lucky... lucky to

speaker_heading: 105-106A
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Let me know when you’re ready to

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Get some sleep, Steve.

dialog: says.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Excuse me. Excuse me, sir?
text: Steve doesn’t respond.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Steve?
text: Steve turns... but says nothing.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: There’s a package here for you.
text: Steve walks up and gets it. It is a poster canister package
text: with GLOBAL return address sticker in the corner. Instead of
text: an address it just says his name.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL —- STEVE’S ROOM - NIGHT 75AA
text: We are close on Steve as he opens the package on his bed. He
text: pulls out the contents and we immediately see a note written
text: in bold that says URGENT!!!: FROM RESEARCH DEPARTMENT.
text: SUBJECT: DUSTIN NOBLE. Underneath the note is paperwork of
dialog: an insurance claim and other statistics. All of which Steve
text: breezes through until he gets to... a large photo. We
text: immediately recognize something familiar... the dead cows.
text: As Steve looks harder we see the building behind the cows and
text: recognize it as the same building in the background of
text: Dustin’s leaflets. But this photo is from a different angle
text: and much wider, now showing the surrounding farm and land
text: rather than just the cows and the barn behind it. Red
text: circles are around objects in the background. After taking
text: it all in and processing as fast as he can...
speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: DUSTIN

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, I can guarantee it’s not
dialog: gonna be Athena. Do you have any
dialog: idea how bad this is? Athena’s
dialog: done. It’s over for you.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: What else was I supposed to do,

dialog: I’ve got nothing man! This vote
dialog: meant everything! I had too!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No. You didn’t have to. You
dialog: fucked up.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Then what else am I supposed to do?
dialog: You tell me, Steve. In a world
dialog: where nobody cares. Where a

dialog: Lafayette, Louisiana. Or here in
dialog: Mckinley. Or the next place you
dialog: go. Because you know it’s gonna

speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Those people needed my help, Steve.

dialog: Jesus Christ, Dustin-- why are you
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Fuck!... That was stupid. I
dialog: should've just gotten in the car.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: We were never gonna let them vote.
speaker_heading: 107-109G
text: Steve is completely taken aback. After a long moment... It
text: hits him.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ++. You're with Global. Jesus
dialog: Christ, you're with global.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Did you really think a they were
dialog: going to leave something like this
dialog: in your hands? After you let them
dialog: bring it to a vote? Come on,
dialog: companies like Global don’t rely on
dialog: anyone. That’s how they win. They
dialog: win by controlling every outcome.
dialog: They do that by playing both
dialog: sides...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: But I’ve been--
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: What?... What did you do, Steve?
dialog: What is it you think you did? I
dialog: did everything. All this is me.
dialog: Athena is me. This story is me.
dialog: Getting you the package to take to
dialog: the politician... is me. See,
dialog: you've only done what I’ve allowed
dialog: (expected) (Supposed to) (wanted)
dialog: (Knew you) (predicted) you to
dialog: do... And you did your job. It
dialog: worked. It’s done. We win.
text: Beat. Steve says nothing.
text: Steve looks up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So, this farm--
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Oh come on Steve, stay with me.
dialog: This farm doesn’t matter. They've
dialog: already dealt with this. That’s
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: They said it was a false claim.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Steve.
speaker_heading: 107-109H
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: But, this happened... this
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Of course it happened... And now,
dialog: let me give you a bit of advice...
dialog: you’re gonna want to stop asking
dialog: questions. You’re at the big kids
dialog: table.
text: Beat. Dustin looks into Steve’s eyes.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN (CONT’D)
dialog: You’re a good choice for this,
dialog: Steve. You’ll do a good job. Good
dialog: luck in New York.
text: Dustin walks to the truck and opens the door. He starts the
text: car and in a moment he’s gone.
text: Steve just stands alone in the parking lot, devastated...
text: still holding the poster.
text: After a moment he turns to the door of the motel. Standing
text: behind the screen door... is Sue.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Funny. Smart.

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Knowingly)
dialog: I think we'll be ok.

speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: I’ve got you figured out.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: You don’t really care about any of
dialog: this. You only want to get home to
dialog: your kid... And I think that’s
dialog: terrific.
text: This reaches Sue more than she’ll ever show. Rob looks at
text: her and smiles.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Well, that’s that.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: That’s that.
text: They both know this was their goodbye. Sue turns and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON 79B
text: We see a mirror. One again, Steve pops up into the frame
text: splashing water on his face. We widen out to reveal... he is
text: in a high school bathroom. He looks at himself in the
text: mirror. We can hear the rumblings of a large group of people
text: in the background. We hold on Steve. The sounds get louder
dialog: as we cut to:
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM —- AFTERNOON 80
text: In the stands, once again, a crowd is gathered... much larger
text: than the first time. Once again many of them are holding
text: lemonades. Steve enters through the door holding the taped
text: together poster. He looks out to center court where Richards
text: is getting ready to begin.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: Ok, so if everyone can take their
dialog: seats please? We have a lot to get
dialog: to today.
dialog: 113
text: Steve seems tense... nervous. Suddenly:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Lemonade?
text: Steve turns to see, just a few feet away from him is... the
dialog: lemonade girl.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Is it good?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Really good.
text: Steve looks and sees she has set up right in between the door
dialog: and the stands.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You got a good spot here.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I know.
text: The girl smiles. Steve smiles back and picks up a cup. He
text: takes a sip... tasting it for the first time.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: --. Wow.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I know.
text: She smiles. He places a dollar on the table and picks up the
text: poster, readying himself. We suddenly hear the sound of
dialog: coins.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Mister?
text: Steve turns.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You forgot your change.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh, no, no. That’s for you!
text: The girl is confused... and then puts her arm out holding the
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: The sign says it’s only twenty five
dialog: cents. So... it’s only twenty five
dialog: cents.
dialog: 81
dialog: 114-115
text: This honesty and purity hits Steve... he reaches his hand out
text: and takes the change. Looking down at her looking at him...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ... Really good.
scene_heading: INT. GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOOON 81
text: A man comes up and stands next to Richards. He indicates the
text: basketball team at the other door, now in uniform.
speaker_heading: RICHARDS
dialog: (To the coach)
dialog: I know, I know. We’re just gonna
dialog: be a few more minutes.
dialog: (Back to the crowd)
dialog: Now before we get to the vote,
dialog: Steve Butler just wanted to say a
dialog: few words.
text: Steve arrives at center court and looks out to the bleachers.
text: Sue sits in the front row. Steve looks around and takes some
text: of the familiar faces he has come to know; Drew, Jeff,
text: Claire, Arlene, Frank, etc. He lands on Alice. She looks
text: back at him. He gives her a small smile.
dialog: 116-117
text: Steve holds up the poster.
text: He looks out at the crowd. After a long pause:
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I know there’s been a lot of talk
dialog: about this poster. So I figured
dialog: I'd just show you all.
text: He shows them.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: I was looking at this picture for a
dialog: while last night. A long while...
dialog: But, I found myself staring at this
text: barn. The wood on the side is
text: buckling. Probably from all the
text: salt water in the air. The paint’s
text: chipping and the flag is fading.
dialog: It reminded me of my grandfather's
dialog: barn... That barn was the bane of
dialog: my existence... it was immaculate.
dialog: It seemed like every other summer
dialog: we were out painting that thing.
dialog: Hours and hours... in all that
dialog: heat. And I remember asking him
dialog: why. Why do we have to do this?
dialog: And he'd just look at me and say
dialog: “It’s our barn. Who else is going
dialog: to do it?”
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: I always thought he was crazy...
dialog: And stubborn... and Proud.
text: Steve looks to Alice.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: But I think he was just trying to
dialog: teach me how to take care of
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: You all know Dustin lied... That he
dialog: made up a story to get you to vote
dialog: the way he wanted you to and in the
dialog: end... that’s exactly what he did.
dialog: Dustin isn’t an environmentalist.
dialog: Dustin works for Global. Global
dialog: couldn't afford an environmental
dialog: presence... so they created their
dialog: own.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 82
speaker_heading: 116-117A
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: They wanted to make the decision
dialog: for you... and they were betting
dialog: that you’d let them.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: They were doing all this to protect
dialog: themselves. Because this isn’t
dialog: Dustin’s farm... but it did happen.
dialog: This is a Global farm. Now, I’m
dialog: not saying this would happen here.
dialog: But they know the only reason we're
dialog: all in this room... is to ask...
dialog: what if it did.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know what the answer is
dialog: anymore... But at this point?
dialog: Where we are? We’re betting a lot
dialog: more than we think. Everything we
dialog: have-- everything we are is on the
dialog: table now... And it’s just not ours
dialog: to lose.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is still our barn. No matter
dialog: what they do... no matter what they
dialog: think... it’s still our barn...
dialog: that’1l never change.
text: Steve just stands. No one says anything. Sue just stares at
text: him. After a moment, he sees the players in the doorway.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: «+. Go Pioneers.
text: Steve heads for the door, a man with purpose.
scene_heading: EXT. GYMNASIUM —- PARKING LOT 82
dialog: 118
text: Sue leans on the front end of the Bronco. Suddenly she looks
text: over to see... Steve walking out of the gymnasium. She’s
text: finishing up a phone call.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: «+. I understand.
text: She doesn’t even look at Steve as he walks up to the Bronco.
text: She hangs up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Was that them?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yes... You're definitely fired.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And you?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: «+. They want to see me in the city
dialog: tomorrow...
text: Steve smiles. Sue walks around the car and gets in. Steve
text: comes around to the passenger side door.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Congratulations.
text: Beat. Sue is processing all of this at once.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Can I give you a lift somewhere?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: C'mon, Sue.
text: Beat. She looks up at him.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It’s open mic night!
text: Sue smiles. Then her smile fades. She pauses and looks
dialog: forward...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It's just a job...
text: She starts the car. Looks back at him.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: --- Oh, for the love of God, at
dialog: least get some new boots.
dialog: 119
text: Steve smiles.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: «+. Not a chance.
text: She drives off.
text: Steve just stands and watches the car drive away... Then take
text: a turn and disappear.
text: He is now alone. Quietly we begin to hear music...
text: Steve finally turns and walks across the street. As we
text: follow him we finally see... Buddy's. The music begins to
dialog: build.
text: Steve looks to the bar and barely, but enough, we can see a
text: sign... OPEN MIC NIGHT.
text: The camera widens... as Steve enters the bar. And as the
text: camera continues to rise we see ... for the first time... a
dialog: shot of this main street... the first full picture of this
dialog: town.
