scene_heading: PROLOGUE: INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. EVENING.
text: Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film,
text: sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates
text: around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (O/S)
dialog: <i>If I could just go back. If I could rub
dialog: everything out. Starting with myself.
dialog: Starting with borrowing a jacket.</i>
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST TERRACE. EARLY EVENING.
text: Ripley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano.
text: CREDITS begin.
speaker_heading: FRAN (SINGS)
dialog: <i>Ah, such fleeting paradise
dialog: such innocent delight
dialog: to love,
dialog: be loved,
dialog: a lullabye,
dialog: then silence.</i>
text: The song finishes. Applause. They're the entertainment at a
text: cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary.
text: Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A
text: distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair,
text: approaches Ripley, offers his hand.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
text: (pointing at Ripley's borrowed
dialog: jacket)
dialog: I see you were at Princeton.
dialog: Then you'll most likely know our son,
dialog: Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
speaker_heading: EMILY GREENLEAF
dialog: We couldn't help noticing your jacket.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EMILY GREENLEAF
dialog: Class of '56?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (hesitating)
dialog: How is Dickie?
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.
text: Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an
text: elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley.
speaker_heading: EMILY GREENLEAF
dialog: (to Fran)
dialog: I hope you'll come and see us...
speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: That's very kind.
speaker_heading: EMILY GREENLEAF
dialog: Both of you...
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: Of course, Dickie's idea of music is
dialog: Jazz. He has a saxophone. To my ear Jazz
text: is just noise, just an insolent noise.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING.
text: Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into
text: his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley
text: crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him
dialog: his share of their fee.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Gotta run. I'm so late.
dialog: (he hands Fran's boyfriend the
dialog: jacket he's been wearing)
dialog: Thanks for the jacket.
speaker_heading: BOYFRIEND
dialog: Sure. Thanks for filling in for me.
text: From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing.
speaker_heading: EMILY GREENLEAF
dialog: Darling couple, aren't they?
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: Yes. An exceptional young man.
text: From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets
text: into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.
scene_heading: EXT. THEATER. EVENING.
text: Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and
text: heads for the theater. Music continues.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER. NIGHT.
text: The interval: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming
text: themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers
text: towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and
text: through him. Put coins in a bowl.
scene_heading: INT. A BOX AT THE THEATER. NIGHT
text: The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at
text: the performances. A haughty woman in the box turns round and
text: he closes the curtain.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE. 1:30 A.M.
text: An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue
text: ghostlight. A caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on
text: the house lights. Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves
text: apologetically.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Sorry, sorry. I know. Sorry.
scene_heading: EXT. GREENLEAF SHIPYARDS, BROOKLYN. DAY.
text: Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks. A
text: huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers
text: preparing the shell of a new liner. If Central Park is where
dialog: the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made. And a
text: lot of it. Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name
text: over the buildings behind them.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: Mongibello. Tiny place. South of Naples.
dialog: Marge, his uh, the young lade is
dialog: supposedly writing some kind of book. God
dialog: knows what he does. By all accounts they
dialog: spend the whole time on the beach. Or his
dialog: sailboat. That's my son's talent,
dialog: spending his allowance.
text: Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a
text: sober young man, listens attentively.
speaker_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd)
dialog: Could you ever conceive of going to
dialog: Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?
dialog: (Ripley looks doubtful)
dialog: I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir,
dialog: but...
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: Good. Now you can go for a reason.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.
text: A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up. An exuberant and
text: mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides
text: into a raucous big band jazz number: Dizzy Gillespie's <i>The
text: Champ</i>. A HAND ejects the record. When the camera finds the
text: man's face it is BLINDFOLDED. He's hot. He's wearing an
text: undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (O/S)
dialog: I don't know. Count Basie? Duke
dialog: Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.
text: The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of
text: the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses
text: to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.
text: A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered
text: table which includes classical sheet music and a paper
text: keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.
text: Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.
text: Chet Baker's <i>My Funny Valentine</i>. Signs everywhere of
text: packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy. Ripley paces in this
text: BASEMENT room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and
text: bedroom all in one. Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows
text: give onto bars and a wall.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Don't even know if this is a man or a
dialog: woman.
text: There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He
text: flinches.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.
text: Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing
text: himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:
text: Charlie Parker's <i>Koko</i>. He listens hard, recognizes the
dialog: track.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: That's Charlie Parker. Bird.
text: He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record. He's
text: right, he smiles.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.
text: Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a
text: Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up
text: his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment
text: before closing the door behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.
text: Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight.
text: He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's
dialog: chauffeur.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: Here. I'll take that.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CARETAKER
dialog: (nodding towards the apartment)
dialog: That thousand bucks should come in handy.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
text: (interupts Ripley, who is
text: about to open the car door)
dialog: I'll get that.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
text: (as he holds open the door for
dialog: Ripley)
dialog: Sir.
dialog: (Ripley laughs excitedly)
dialog: You're gonna have a great trip. Mr
dialog: Greenleaf is personal friends with the
dialog: Cunard people.
scene_heading: INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S CAR. DAY.
text: Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He
text: opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery.
text: Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks
dialog: and dollars.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: I can tell you. The Greenleaf name opens
dialog: a lot of doors.
scene_heading: EXT. QUEEN MARY, MANHATTAN SKYLINE. DAY.
text: The liner leaves New York en route to Italy. END CREDITS.
scene_heading: INT. NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS &amp; IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY.
text: ITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked.
text: Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows.
text: Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted,
text: escorted, fussed over into the hall. Their bags have been
text: unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall
text: under the initials of their owners. STANDS WITH THE LETTERS
text: OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks
text: and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around
text: them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants
text: his name. <i>Ripley. Ripley. Ripley!</i> he repeats in the hubbub
text: and joins the crowd around the letter R. A striking young
text: woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him.
text: Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a
text: line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith
text: catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: What's your secret?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: No, it's just - you are American, aren't
dialog: you? - no, I just, I have so much
dialog: luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined.
dialog: It's humiliating.
text: Ripley shrugs. Now they're opening a second case of the
text: passenger ahead. Hard not to converse.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (cont'd)
dialog: I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith
dialog: Randall.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Hello.
text: They are passed through immigration, head down the long
text: stairs towards the street. Meredith catches up with Ripley.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (cont'd)
dialog: You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (thinking quickly)
text: Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: So now, did they put your suitcase in the
dialog: wrong pile? It's just - upstairs -
dialog: weren't you under the R stand? I thought
dialog: I saw you there.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: My father wants me in New York. He builds
dialog: boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel
dialog: under my mother's name.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Emily.
dialog: (Meredith's bewildered)
dialog: Just kidding.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: The funny thing is, I'm not Randall
dialog: either. I'm Logue.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (nods, recognizing the name)
dialog: As in the...?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
text: As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug
dialog: off the dress. I travel under my mother's
dialog: name, too.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Randall.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Right.
text: They've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs
dialog: explain the choices: one way for Buses, Taxis and exits - the
text: other for Trains: ROMA, VENEZIA, MILANO. They're going in
dialog: different directions.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (cont'd)
dialog: (offering her hand)
text: So - partners in disguise.
dialog: (looks at the signs)
dialog: Bye.
scene_heading: EXT. COASTAL ROAD FROM NAPLES. LATE AFTERNOON.
text: A BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a
text: cliff, mountain above, blue sea below.
scene_heading: INT. BUS. LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a
text: new town. People get off.
scene_heading: INT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.
text: Later, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on
text: their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind
text: down through a square, passing the local church.
scene_heading: EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. LATE DAY.
text: And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side
text: there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men
text: working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the
text: street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on
text: their Vespas. The Driver chants -
speaker_heading: DRIVER
speaker_heading: MONGIBELLO!
text: Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on
text: its way. He looks around him. He feels completely foreign.
scene_heading: EXT. MIRAMARE HOTEL/BOAT AT SEA. MORNING.
text: A SAILBOAT has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops
text: the sail. A couple dive off and swim towards shore.
text: ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's
text: watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony
text: in the Miramare Hotel. An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched
text: on his knees and, during this, he continues his study,
text: mouthing the Italian words.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
text: (looking at a long, lean girl
dialog: about to dive)
dialog: La fidanzata a una faccia. The fiancÈe
text: has a face. La fidanzata e Marge.
text: Her partner, DICKIE GREENLEAF, dives too. They're brown,
text: beautiful, perfect. Ripley notices the name of the boat:
dialog: "BIRD".
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (cont'd)
dialog: Questo e la mia faccia.....
text: The golden couple emerge from the sea. Dickie shakes off the
text: water, grins.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (cont'd)
dialog: This is my face.
text: He double-checks himself with the vocabulary book.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (cont'd)
dialog: Questa...e la mia faccia. Questa e la
dialog: faccia di Dickie.
scene_heading: EXT. MONGIBELLO. DAY.
text: Ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on
text: the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. He's wearing A TINY
text: LIME-GREEN BATHING SUIT. He loathes beaches. A couple of boys
text: turn laconically and watch him.
text: Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. He feels
text: ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies.
text: Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes
text: and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness
text: of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up
dialog: to Dickie.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Dickie Greenleaf?
text: Dickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at
dialog: Princeton together.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (he sits up)
dialog: And did we know each other?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must
dialog: have known me.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (to Marge)
dialog: Princeton is like a fog, America's like a
dialog: fog.
dialog: (to Ripley)
dialog: This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what
dialog: was it?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: How do you do.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: What are you doing in Mongi?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
text: Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (finds this idea absurd)
dialog: Passing through! You're so white. Did you
dialog: ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray,
dialog: actually.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It's just an undercoat.
dialog: (Marge laughs)
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Say again?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You know, a primer.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: That's funny.
text: He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh. Ripley
text: stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You should come and have lunch with us,
dialog: before you go - Dickie?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Sure. Any time.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in
text: danger of turning a little pink.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Thanks. Well, a coincidence.
scene_heading: EXT. MONGIBELLO. EARLY MORNING.
text: ANOTHER DAY. Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in
text: shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square
text: on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps.
text: RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches
text: all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty,
text: SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then
text: climbs on the scooter, behind him.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I've been looking for you everywhere.
speaker_heading: SILVANA
dialog: Ah, today you're looking for me. And
dialog: where have you been the rest of the week?
dialog: Pig. With your American girl? I hate
dialog: you, you know?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SILVANA
dialog: I hate you.
text: And RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards
dialog: the sea.
scene_heading: EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.
text: Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.
text: Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of
text: the remnants of lunch. Dickie's sheepish, showered, late.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late,
dialog: I'm a swine.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Did you forget where I live? It's four
dialog: o'clock.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I just woke up. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You just woke up!
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Fausto and I - we took the boat out, we
dialog: were fishing, and then it was dawn and
dialog: we'd caught absolutely nothing.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Well, we ate everything without you.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: We?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
text: As Ripley appears with the tray to collect more dishes.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We
dialog: thought you'd disappeared. We were going
text: to send out a search party.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: No, still here.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Tom was telling me about his trip over.
dialog: Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Is that good?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Shut up!
text: Marge flicks him with a napkin. They start to wrestle,
dialog: excluding Tom.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'm intruding.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Can you mix a martini?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (going inside)
dialog: I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Everybody should have one talent.
dialog: (to Ripley)
dialog: What's yours?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (without a beat)
text: Forging signatures. Telling lies.
dialog: Impersonating practically anybody.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (enjoying this banter)
dialog: That's three. Nobody should have more
dialog: than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent -
text: (his voice ages, his face
dialog: changes)
dialog: <i>The only talent my son has is for cashing
dialog: his allowance.</i>
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (absolutely thrown)
dialog: What? What's this?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: <i>I like to sail, believe me, I love to
dialog: sail! Instead I make boats and other
dialog: people sail them.</i>
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (incredibly impressed)
dialog: Stop! It's too much! You're making all
dialog: the hairs on my neck stand up!
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (relishing it)
dialog: <i>Jazz, let's face it, it's just an
dialog: insolent noise.</i>
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the
dialog: old bastard is here right now! That's
dialog: brilliant! How do you know him?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I met him in New York.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Marge! You've got to hear this!
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (returning with the drinks)
dialog: What? What?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf
dialog: 1st.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: <i>Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a
dialog: fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.</i>
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Uncanny!
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: <i>Could you ever conceive of going there,
dialog: Tom, and bringing him back?</i>
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: <i>I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and
dialog: persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you
dialog: $1000.</i>
scene_heading: INT/EXT. MONGIBELLO CHURCH AND SQUARE. DUSK.
text: A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring
dialog: out of Church for the <i>Passeggiata</i> in Sunday best. Girls arm
text: in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are
text: compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug.
text: Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's
dialog: scheming.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I'm never going back. To actually hire
dialog: somebody to come all the way here to drag
dialog: me back home - got to be insane, hasn't
dialog: he?
text: SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her
text: fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal
text: FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise
text: there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other.
text: Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on.
speaker_heading: DICKIE (cont'd)
dialog: I'm never going back!
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: No, I think your mother, her illness -
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: It's got nothing to do with my mother!
dialog: She's had leukemia for - ! This is what
dialog: makes me boil about him! HE wants me
dialog: back! - it's got nothing to do with my
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling
dialog: you what I -
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Go back! Go back to New York or call him
dialog: if you can find a telephone that works,
dialog: and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me
text: back to him or his shipyard.
scene_heading: EXT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON.
text: Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front
text: door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of
text: which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his
text: fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom
text: talking with Dickie.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Hi Tom.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (looks up)
text: Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I'll come down.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (to Ripley)
dialog: Did you speak to my father?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You were right about the telephones.
dialog: There are no lines, there's some problem.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (coming out of the front door)
dialog: Hello Tom. You're off? What are your
dialog: plans?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
text: He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the
text: seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He
text: bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's -
text: Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: You like jazz!
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (gathering up the records)
dialog: I <i>love</i> jazz.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (holding up a Chet Baker)
dialog: This is the best. Marge says she likes
dialog: jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is
dialog: jazz.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I never said that!
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Bird. That's jazz.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I don't know. What's the name of your
dialog: sailboat?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: <i>Bird!</i>
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Which is ridiculous. Boats are female,
dialog: everyone knows you can't call a boat
text: after a man.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: He's not a man, he's a god.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a
dialog: club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: It's vile.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't
dialog: have to come.
dialog: (to Ripley)
dialog: It's great. You're going to love it.
scene_heading: INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.
text: A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast
text: out their version of <i>MOANIN'</i>. Dickie and Ripley arrive and
text: make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with
text: friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts
text: introductions and they shake Ripley's hand. Dickie is
text: instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie.
text: An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses
text: Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for
text: her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his
text: cigarette. Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's
text: clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to <i>Tu
dialog: vuo' fa' L'Americano</i> - a hit which reflects the current craze
text: for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie
text: up onto the stage.
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: (improvising in Italian)
dialog: <i>Ladies and Gentlemen. Dickie Greenleaf,
dialog: all the way from America... etc.</i>
text: Fausto starts to sing. Dickie joins in the chorus. Everybody
text: claps. Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto.
speaker_heading: FAUSTO (cont'd)
text: <i>And a big round of applause for a new
dialog: friend from New York - Tom Ripley!</i>
text: Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls
text: him up. The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's
text: Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can
text: sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience
text: is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.
speaker_heading: DICKIE (O/S)
dialog: (reading)
dialog: <i>I have bumped into an old friend from
dialog: Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley.
dialog: He says he's going to haunt me until I
dialog: agree to come back to New York with
dialog: him...</i>
scene_heading: INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NOON.
text: Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table,
text: typing. Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which
text: he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Good afternoon!
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What time is it?
text: (puts on his glasses and checks
dialog: his watch)
dialog: Oh God! Do you always type your letters?
dialog: (points at the letter)
dialog: That should be two Ts.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I can't write and I can't spell. That's
dialog: the privilege of a first-class education.
dialog: You're upstairs at the back. I think
text: Ermelinda made the bed up.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: This is so good of you.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Don't say it again. Now you're a Double
dialog: Agent and we're going to string my Dad
dialog: alone, I was thinking we might buy a
dialog: little car with the expense money he's
dialog: sending you. What do you think, Marge...a
dialog: little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
text: Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No,
dialog: what we need urgently is an icebox. What
dialog: do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll
dialog: be your friend for life.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I absolutely agree with Marge.
scene_heading: INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS. DAY.
text: Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a
text: comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only
text: to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. DAY.
text: Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the
text: Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out
text: shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries,
text: cufflinks scattered, a silk tie. Ripley picks up the tie and
text: walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where
text: lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of
text: conversation float up to Ripley.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: It'll just be for a little while. He can
dialog: be... he makes me laugh.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Okay, darling.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: You'd say if you mind?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: No, I like him.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Marge, you like everybody.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I don't like you.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Then I'll go to your place and you can
dialog: move in with Tom.
text: Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing
dialog: the cadences, <i>No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody,</i>
text: until he's as accurate as a taperecorder.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY.
text: Ermelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and
text: sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the
text: coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he
text: uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his
text: pants, his rings.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Now you know why Miss Sherwood always
dialog: shows up for breakfast. It's not love
dialog: it's the coffee machine.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: It's the one task Dickie can do on his
dialog: own - make coffee.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh darling - is that for me?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
text: (as Dickie hands him his cup)
dialog: That ring's so great. The green one.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: Tom, I love you!
dialog: (to Dickie)
dialog: See!
dialog: (to Ripley)
dialog: I bought it for him, for his birthday.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It's superb.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I had to promise, capital P, never to
dialog: take it off - otherwise I'd give it to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MARGE
text: (flicking a crumb at him)
dialog: Bastard!
dialog: (to Ripley)
dialog: Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in
dialog: Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I hope it wasn't cheap.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh, it was.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (to Marge)
dialog: I have to find a birthday present for
dialog: Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Frances?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: My fiancÈe.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Your parents met her.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Oh God - I can just imagine - <i>if only
dialog: Dickie would settle down... doesn't every
dialog: parent deserve a grandchild?</i> Never! I
dialog: swear on your ring, Marge. I am never
dialog: going back.
scene_heading: EXT. BIRD SAILBOAT. DAY.
text: The Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a
text: manoeuvre going on with the sail. Captain Dickie supervises
text: his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please
text: Ripley. Dickie goes over to help him.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: You're doing great. We'll make a sailor
dialog: of you yet. You're doing really well.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing
dialog: Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Yes please!
text: She heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Could we sail to Venice?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Sure. I love Venice.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I have to go to Venice.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or
dialog: is it Rome? You do something and die,
dialog: don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: And Rome.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Do you ski?
dialog: (Ripley frowns)
dialog: Don't tell me - you're a lost cause!
dialog: That's the next thing to deal with. We're
text: planning to go to Cortina at Christmas.
dialog: Excellent skiing. Excellent.
dialog: (as Marge reappears)
dialog: Marge - Ripley can't ski. We'll have to
dialog: teach him that, too. Have you ever known
dialog: such low class?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting
dialog: married. We might have to invite him on
dialog: our honeymoon.
scene_heading: EXT. MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.
text: Marge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition. They walk down
text: the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the
text: little square. Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue
dialog: crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my
dialog: book, and I was always going to this cafe
dialog: with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to
dialog: play his saxophone outside and I would
dialog: see him and he would see me, and he would
dialog: play <i>My Funny Valentine.</i> It was only
dialog: later that I realised he only knows about
dialog: six songs.
text: They've arrived at the Grocery Store. Alessandra, the woman
text: who owns the store greets them. Silvana, who's her daughter,
text: is also there, and less comfortable. She waits for Marge's
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: MARGE (cont'd)
dialog: (to Silvana, in Italian)
dialog: <i>Buono Sera, Silvana. Por favore: arance e
dialog: pane, e del prosciutto.</i>
speaker_heading: SILVANA
dialog: <i>E fichi? Come sempre?</i>
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: <i>Si. Come sempre. Grazie.</i>
text: Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread. Marge frowns.
speaker_heading: MARGE (cont'd)
dialog: (back to Ripley)
dialog: Anyway, then one day, we go in, I see
dialog: Dickie, he starts playing <i>My Funny
dialog: Valentine,</i> and then all of a sudden he
text: just walks into the cafe, right in front
dialog: of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me! Now I had
dialog: never spoken to him in my life - he said
dialog: <i>I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want
dialog: you to come with me.</i> So I did.
text: At the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men
text: throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a
text: small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and
dialog: two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana.
text: Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce
text: en route. Dickie waves. They wave back. Marge calls to him.
speaker_heading: MARGE (cont'd)
dialog: If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom
dialog: and I are running off together.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. EARLY EVENING.
text: Dickie and Ripley are leaving. They're fooling around.
text: Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders. Marge watches from the
text: top of the garden.
scene_heading: EXT. MONGIBELLO SQUARE. EARLY EVENING.
text: Dickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's
text: grocery store. Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's
text: tense, a little troubled. They huddle, Ripley isolated.
speaker_heading: SILVANA
dialog: Did you get my message? I want to talk
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I want to talk to you too...Smile for me.
text: And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him
text: then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.
scene_heading: EXT. COASTAL ROAD TO NAPLES. EVENING.
text: Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where
text: the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains
text: speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: You're breaking my ribs!
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: You're breaking my ribs!
scene_heading: INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.
dialog: Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of <i>My Funny
text: Valentine</i> in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is
text: playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous
text: applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley.
scene_heading: INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living
text: room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a
text: couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through
dialog: his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I could fuck this icebox I love it so
dialog: much.
dialog: (considering Ripley)
dialog: What were you actually doing in New York?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I played piano in a few places.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: That's one job, you told me a lot of
dialog: jobs.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway,
dialog: I don't want to think about New York.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I
text: spend hours speculating.
dialog: (drinking)
dialog: Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Copy out from here...
text: He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
text: (staring to write on the back
dialog: of a postcard)
dialog: I love the fact you brought Shakespeare
dialog: with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says
dialog: you wash the same shirt out every night.
dialog: Is that true?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: No! I've got more than one shirt!
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: She can do that stuff for you. Anyway,
dialog: just wear some of my things, wear
dialog: anything you want, most of it's ancient.
dialog: (he's finished writing)
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Now your signature.
dialog: (watching him write)
dialog: Not "Dickie". Your signature.
text: Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard.
text: Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean
text: them. Dickie looks at him.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Without the glasses you're not even ugly.
dialog: (takes them, tries them on)
dialog: I don't need them because I never read.
dialog: How do I look.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Like Clark Kent.
dialog: (takes them back, puts them on
dialog: beaming at Dickie)
dialog: Now Superman.
text: Dickie cuffs him. Ripley looks down at the postcard.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I know. I write like a child.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T,
dialog: do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's
dialog: pain, that's secret pain.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: It must be a deep secret, cause I don't
dialog: know about it.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Your handwriting - nothing more naked.
dialog: See - nothing's quite touching the line -
dialog: that's vanity.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (flattered)
dialog: Well we certainly know that's true.
scene_heading: INT. DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.
text: Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next
text: to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the
text: board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the
text: water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a
text: burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Do you have any brothers?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: No, no brothers, no sisters.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: me neither. Nor does Marge. All only
dialog: children - what does that mean?
text: He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Means we never shared a bath.
dialog: I'm cold. Can I get in?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I didn't mean with you in it.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune
dialog: anyway.
text: He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But
text: Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie
text: turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with
dialog: his towel.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY.
text: An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's
text: not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious. Dickie
dialog: is used to it.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: It is me. It's an old picture.
dialog: (sighs at Ripley)
dialog: Every time - 'is it you? Doesn't look
dialog: like you'.
text: He's signing for his allowance. He has a smart document case
text: with his initials prominently embossed. Ripley watches him
text: sign and collect a large wad of notes.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Letters - <i>Greenleaf,</i> and for <i>Ripley.</i>
text: Ripley collects and studies his mail. As they walk outside he
text: holds up one letter to Dickie.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Fran.
dialog: (anticipating her letter)
dialog: <i>I miss you, where are you coming home?
dialog: Stop telling me what a great time you're
dialog: having, how you love Dickie... and Marge
dialog: and...</i>
dialog: (the next letter)
dialog: And this one, I think, is your dad...
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN TO ROME. DAY.
text: Ripley sits reading the LETTER from Herbert Greenleaf. He
text: frowns, stops reading, looks out of the window.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: What does he say?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: He's getting impatient. He wants me to
dialog: reassure him you'll be home by
dialog: Thanksgiving.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: You've got to get a new jacket. Really.
dialog: You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm
dialog: sick of seeing you in them.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I can't. I can't keep spending your
dialog: father's money.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I love how responsible you are. My Dad
dialog: should make you Chief Accountant or
dialog: something. Let me buy you a jacket.
dialog: There's a great place when we get to
dialog: Rome, Batistoni.
text: Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni".
speaker_heading: DICKIE (cont'd)
dialog: Andiamo a Roma. We're taking Tom to
dialog: Roma!
scene_heading: EXT. ARCARI'S CAFE, PIAZZA NAVONA, ROME. DAY.
text: Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona.
dialog: Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd. There are
text: already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of
text: Frascati. Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly
text: impatient. Dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the
dialog: duration.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Where do we find a carozza for the Forum,
dialog: or can we hire any of them - ?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Relax.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It's just there's so much to do in a
dialog: single day.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Relax. The most important question is
dialog: where to eat. I hope Freddie made a
dialog: reservation.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Freddie?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Freddie Miles. You know - he's
dialog: organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
text: Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. A
text: horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his
text: open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and
text: bustles over. He's a heavy-set American with a reddish
text: crewcut. Ripley finds him disgusting to look at. Dickie is
dialog: delighted.
speaker_heading: DICKIE (cont'd)
dialog: Frederico!
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: Ciao bello.
text: (noticing a beautiful woman in
text: an open-topped car)
dialog: Don't you want to fuck every woman you
dialog: see. Just once.
text: They kiss cheeks, continental-style.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: (mugging)
dialog: Hey, if I'm late, think what her
dialog: husband's saying!
text: He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE (cont'd)
dialog: So let's go. I got us a table outside at
dialog: Fabrizio's.
text: And Dickie's up, leaving Ripley to pick up all the tiny
text: checks to work out the bill and pay it.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with
dialog: Mongi.
text: Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the
text: street to Freddie's car.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: I know. I was there.
text: (looks back to see Ripley
dialog: struggling to settle the
dialog: check)
dialog: Tommy! It's S.R.O. Two seater.
dialog: Standing Room Only. Chop, chop, Tommy!
text: Ripley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He
text: has to crouch in the rear.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE (cont'd)
dialog: You're going to have to sit between us.
dialog: But don't put your shoes on the seat,
dialog: know what I mean, put them one on top of
dialog: the other. Okay?
scene_heading: INT. A JAZZ RECORD STORE. LATE AFTERNOON.
text: This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and
text: stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the
text: stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke. There are two
text: LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed
text: into it, sharing a set of headphones. Ripley stands outside
text: the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant,
text: while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly.
text: He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading.
text: Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the
text: accordion doors.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and
dialog: meet some friends of Freddie's. The best
dialog: thing is - if you want to be a tourist -
dialog: grab a cab and we can meet up at the
dialog: railway station.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (absolutely crestfallen)
dialog: What club?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Freddie's arranged it with some of the
dialog: skiing crowd. Come if you want but I
dialog: thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I did. And then maybe get the jacket and
dialog: what have you...
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: (from inside the booth)
dialog: Dick - you've got to hear this!
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (oblivious to Ripley's pain)
dialog: Listen, just take one of mine when we get
dialog: back. Don't worry about it. I did the
dialog: Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is
dialog: enough in anyone's life.
text: Ripley hands him the coats, turns away.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Ciao. Have fun.
text: Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the
text: booth. Dickie pushes it open.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You said to make sure you didn't miss the
text: train. It leaves at eight.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAPITOL. LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's
text: looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then
text: he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This
text: is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by
text: antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't
dialog: alone.
scene_heading: INT. ROME RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT.
text: It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of
text: the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving
text: up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his
text: compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone.
scene_heading: INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: There's music playing, Bing Crosby's "May I". Very loud.
text: Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED
text: AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair,
text: catches one of Dickie's expressions. There are clothes
text: abandoned everywhere. He's been having a big dressing-up
text: session. He sings along with Bing.
speaker_heading: DICKIE (O/S)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the
text: doorway. The music thumps away.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Oh - just amusing myself. Sorry, Dickie.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I didn't think you were coming back.
text: Dickie turns off the record player.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I wish you'd get out of my clothes.
text: Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with
text: mortification and shock. Dickie looks at his feet, shakes
text: his head.
speaker_heading: DICKIE (cont'd)
dialog: Shoes too?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (lame, ashamed)
dialog: You said I could pick out a jacket and I
dialog: just... Sorry.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Get undressed in your own room, would
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I thought you'd missed the train.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Freddie drove me back in his car.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Is Freddie here?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
text: He's downstairs.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I was just fooling around. Don't say
dialog: anything. Sorry.
text: Dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the
text: dressing-up session, not amused.
scene_heading: EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. DAY.
text: Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and
text: Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace. Dickie looks
text: perfectly happy.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Hi, Tom. Come join us.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: I want this job of yours, Tommy. I was
dialog: just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in
dialog: Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear
text: his clothes, and his father picks up the
dialog: tab. If you get bored, let me know, I'll
dialog: do it!
scene_heading: EXT. THE OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DAY.
text: The boat is drifting. Freddie and Dickie and Marge are
text: swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley
text: is sitting alone, reading.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You really should go in, it's marvellous.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'm fine.
text: She approaches him, conscious of his isolation. She's in a
text: red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Sure.
text: They watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun
dialog: shines on you and it's glorious, then he
dialog: forgets you and it's very very cold.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: So I'm learning.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: He's not even aware of it. When you've
dialog: got his attention you feel like you're
dialog: the only person in the world. That's why
dialog: everybody loves him. Other times...
text: There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (laughing and choking)
dialog: He's drowning me!
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: It's always the same whenever someone new
dialog: comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto,
dialog: Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful -
dialog: did you meet him, he's a musician? -
dialog: ... and especially you, of course... and
dialog: that's only the boys.
text: They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.
speaker_heading: MARGE (cont'd)
dialog: Tell me, why is it when men play they
dialog: always play at killing each other...?
dialog: I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What about Cortina?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Didn't Dick say? - he talked to
dialog: Freddie... apparently it's not going to
dialog: work out -
dialog: (Ripley's devastated, Marge
dialog: notices, can't look at him)
dialog: Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DUSK.
text: LATER and now the boat is sailing again. Ripley is sitting in
text: his spot. Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Come on, Frederico, do you really have
dialog: to go back? At least stick around for
dialog: the Festival of the Madonna.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: I don't think so. Come back with me to
dialog: Rome. There's this great new club. Have
dialog: some drinks, lotta ladies...
text: Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie
text: makes a face at Freddie.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Do you think you can steer this thing?
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
text: Just point her at Capri and avoid the
dialog: rocks.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Marge-maintenance.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: Aye, aye.
text: Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the
text: tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the
dialog: water.
text: From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but
text: he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering
text: him a restricted view. He looks down and there's a flash of
text: flesh, then nothing. Then as the boat swings with the waves,
text: he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then
text: Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted
text: toes straining. Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely
dialog: betrayed.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE (cont'd)
dialog: Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy,
dialog: you were looking. Tommy Tommy Tommy.
text: Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting
text: before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.
scene_heading: EXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY.
text: The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House. Dickie as
text: ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting
text: instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew. Ripley
text: looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring.
text: Dickie notices her too.
scene_heading: EXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY.
text: A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.
text: It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with
text: flowers and a lace veil. As she is revealed, wooden,
text: staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette,
text: wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their
dialog: shoulders.
dialog: The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual
text: Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their
text: fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and
text: altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from
text: Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is
text: carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves,
text: the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is
text: walking on water.
text: Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water,
text: about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from
text: among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA.
text: One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the
text: direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse.
text: It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the
text: palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief -
text: wades, swims, splashes towards the body.
text: PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people
text: splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace,
text: Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye.
scene_heading: EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY.
text: Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below
text: them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the
text: whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters,
text: police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle
text: A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her
text: brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What's the fight about? That's her
dialog: fiancÈ, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (sharp)
dialog: I don't know! Why are you asking me?
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: How can it take an hour to find an
dialog: ambulance?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (conciliatory)
dialog: Well, she was already dead, darling,
dialog: wasn't she, so I suppose -
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I don't know why people say this
dialog: country's civilised. It isn't. It's
dialog: fucking primitive.
text: And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING
text: THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across
text: the terrace. Dickie storms inside.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Dickie!
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'll go and see what's the matter.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I'll go.
scene_heading: INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window
text: overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening
text: phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears,
text: begins tidying the mess in the living room. He picks up
text: empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I know why you're upset.
dialog: (Dickie continues playing)
dialog: I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you
dialog: and Silvana.
text: Dickie stops playing.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: What about us?
text: He now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles.
speaker_heading: DICKIE (cont'd)
dialog: (losing his temper)
dialog: You don't have to clean up! Really!
text: Ripley disappears into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: DICKIE (cont'd)
dialog: (as Ripley returns)
dialog: She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do
dialog: you know what that means in a place like
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'm prepared to take the blame.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You've been so good to me. You're the
dialog: brother I never had. I'm the brother you
dialog: never had.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: She came to me for help, she needed
dialog: money, and I didn't help her. I didn't
dialog: help her. Now she's dead and it's my
dialog: fault.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'm not going to say anything - to Marge,
dialog: or anybody, the police - It's a secret
dialog: between us and I'll keep it.
text: And he disappears again, leaving Dickie to resume the sax,
text: somehow in thrall to Ripley.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (O/S)
dialog: <i>Dear Tom, I think the time has come to
dialog: discontinue your expense checks...</i>
scene_heading: EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, NAPLES. DAY.
text: Ripley and Dickie are walking out of the American Express
text: Office, Dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case,
text: Ripley - despondent - reading aloud extracts from a letter
dialog: from Herbert Greenleaf -
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: <i>...The thousand dollars, of course, was
dialog: only due in the event that you succeeded
dialog: in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I
dialog: hope the trip has afforded you some
dialog: pleasure despite the failure of its main
dialog: objective you need no longer consider
dialog: yourself obligated to us in any way...</i>
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: You can't blame him. You could hardly
dialog: expect this to go on forever.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I thought you might write again. Now that
dialog: we're brothers...
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've
dialog: had a good run, haven't we?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (increasingly miserable)
dialog: What about Venice? Can we stick to that
dialog: plan at least?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on
dialog: here without money. It's time we all
dialog: moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi.
dialog: Especially now with everything - I really
dialog: want to move to the North. I need to
dialog: check out San Remo next week, find
dialog: somewhere new to keep the boat.
dialog: But it would be great, though, if you
dialog: came with me. Our last trip before you
dialog: leave. There's a jazz festival - we could
dialog: say goodbye in style. What do you think?
dialog: A last trip?
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN TO SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.
text: Dickie and Ripley travel up to San Remo. They sit next to
text: each other. Dickie's asleep. Ripley lays his head on Dickie's
text: shoulder, but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces
text: the San Remo stop, taps on the window and Dickie stirs. Then
text: Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the
text: reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head
text: and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's. Dickie
text: suddenly catches him staring. Ripley looks away.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (terse)
dialog: Why do you do that thing - with your
dialog: neck? On trains you always do that thing,
dialog: it's so spooky.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL TERRACE RESTAURANT, SAN REMO. NIGHT.
text: Dickie and Ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which
text: lips out towards the sea. There's a restaurant and palms and
text: a JAZZ QUINTET playing, American. Very cool. They pass the
text: band. Dickie's captivated as they head for their table. They
text: pass some girls at a table. Dickie smiles greedily.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: This is more like it. Didn't I tell you
dialog: San Remo was crazy!
text: They're shown to a good table. Dickie watches the band while
text: their glasses are filled with champagne. Ripley looks happy.
dialog: He's got Dickie all to himself.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: To Mongibello and the happiest days of my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'm suddenly quite happy to be going
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: That's good.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I've got plans!
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Ripley's plans.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Esatto. I'm always planning.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I
dialog: didn't, did I?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Why are you asking all of a sudden?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: No reason. Because you're leaving, I
dialog: guess. I don't think you were there, were
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I mean it as a compliment. You've got
dialog: such great taste, I don't know. Most of
dialog: the thugs at Princeton had tasted
dialog: everything and had no taste. Used to say,
dialog: the cream of America: rich and thick.
dialog: Freddie's the perfect example.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Then I'll take it as a compliment.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Ha.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Do you even like jazz - or was that
dialog: something for my benefit?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (conceding, without guile)
dialog: I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to
dialog: like everything about the way you live.
dialog: It's one big love affair. If you knew my
dialog: life back home in New York...
text: Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert
text: solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what
dialog: do you think about drums?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: So cool.
text: He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this
dialog: - it's superficiality.
scene_heading: EXT. MID OCEAN. DAY.
text: The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor
dialog: boat.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: That's how I found my place in Mongi.
text: Took a boat out round the bay. The first
dialog: place I liked, I got it.
text: The motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by
dialog: the speed.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Dickie, slow down, come on!
text: Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the
text: motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (ecstatic)
dialog: I love it here! Gonna live here!
text: Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of
text: the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers,
text: already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I wanted to tell you my plan.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: So tell me.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I thought I might come back. In the New
dialog: Year. Under my own steam.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (suddenly tight)
dialog: Really? To Italy?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Of course. Let's say, for argument's
dialog: sake, you were here - perhaps we could
dialog: split the rent on a house - I'll get a
dialog: job - or, better still, I could get a
dialog: place in Rome and when we're there we
dialog: could be there and if we're here we could
dialog: be here -
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Oh God, I don't think so.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: - you see, particularly with the Marge
dialog: problem, you can just blame me.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Marge and I are getting married.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Yesterday you're ogling girls on the
dialog: terrace, today you're getting married.
dialog: It's absurd.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I love Marge.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You love me and you're not marrying me.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (cold)
dialog: Tom, I don't love you.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained
dialog: all of that.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I'm actually a little relieved you're
dialog: going, to be honest. I think we've seen
dialog: enough of each other for a while.
text: Ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: You can be a leech - you know this - and
dialog: it's boring. You can be quite boring.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (volcanic)
dialog: The funny thing - <i>I'm</i> not pretending to
dialog: be somebody else and <i>you</i> are. I'm
dialog: absolutely honest with you. I've told you
dialog: my feelings. But you, first of all I know
dialog: there's something - that evening when we
dialog: played chess, for instance, it was
dialog: obvious -
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: What evening?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Sure - I know, that's too dangerous for
dialog: you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers,
dialog: fine, then you do this sordid thing with
dialog: Marge, fucking her on the boat while we
dialog: all have to listen, which was
dialog: excruciating, frankly, plus you follow
dialog: your cock around like a - and now you're
dialog: getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive
dialog: me...you're lying to Marge then getting
dialog: married to her, you're knocking up
dialog: Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've
dialog: got to play drums, which is it, Dickie,
dialog: what do you really play?
text: Dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards Ripley.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
text: (attacking him, administering
text: tiny slaps as punctuation to
dialog: his tirade)
dialog: Who are you - some imposter, some third
dialog: class mooch - who are you to tell me
dialog: anything? Actually, I really really
dialog: really don't want to be on this boat with
dialog: you, I can't move without you moving,
dialog: which is exactly how it feels and it
dialog: gives me the creeps.
dialog: (he goes to rev up the engine)
dialog: I can't move without - "Dickie, Dickie,
dialog: Dickie" - like a little girl. You give
dialog: me the -
text: RIPLEY SMASHES HIM ACROSS THE HEAD WITH THE OAR. DICKIE SLIPS
text: OFF THE WOODEN SEAT, HIS EYES ROLLING IN GROGGY SURPRISE.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up!
text: The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller. Dickie looks
text: up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: For God's sake.
text: Ripley, shocked at himself, goes to Dickie, rocking the boat,
text: catches him up, then is horrified to see Dickie's face,
text: apparently unmarked, SUDDENLY SPLIT OPEN, a line of blood and
text: then a peeling like a fruit bursting. Ripley's appalled. A
text: terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at
dialog: Ripley.
speaker_heading: DICKIE (cont'd)
dialog: I'll kill you!
text: Ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar,
text: kicking off Dickie's hand around his ankle. The boat is
text: rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the
text: tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come
text: off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death
text: wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his
text: own blood, loses his grip.
text: Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like
text: a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood
text: on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath,
text: letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's
text: let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls
text: there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done.
text: Nobody's in sight. The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling
text: indifferently on the waves. Ripley lies by Dickie in the
text: bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted.
text: The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully. The sea
text: calms.
scene_heading: EXT. A COVE NEAR SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.
text: A deserted cove, several miles along the coast. Ripley
text: clambers onto a rock over the shore. He's watching the boat
text: slowly sinking. Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he
text: finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat
text: disappears under the surface.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN REMO. DUSK.
text: Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie's
text: jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.
text: Ripley approaches the front desk. He's shivering. He's not
text: wearing his glasses.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Can I have my key, please?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: (at the key rack)
dialog: Of course - But you must be very cold?
dialog: Signor Greenleaf? Yes? -
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (mind racing)
dialog: No, it's - I'm...
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD BETWEEN NAPLES AND MONGIBELLO. DAY.
text: Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi. He
text: stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea
dialog: what to do.
scene_heading: EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. DAY.
text: The BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very
dialog: together.
scene_heading: INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM, MONGIBELLO. DAY.
text: Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches
text: Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table. He
text: can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much.
scene_heading: INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. DAY.
text: Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is
text: busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the
text: Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read
dialog: part of it - <i>C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear
dialog: Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write</i>... Ripley
dialog: produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES
text: DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter.
scene_heading: EXT. MARGE'S GARDEN, MONGIBELLO. DAY.
text: Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is
text: working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by
text: references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her
text: until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Hello Marge.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Tom, you startled me! You're back.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: How are you? Sorry. Is your book going
dialog: well?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I was just looking at you -
dialog: (looking at her tenderly)
dialog: - so quiet.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Where's Dickie?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I think he's planning on staying in Rome
dialog: for a few days.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: Ha. Did he say why?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I don't know. I don't understand Dickie,
dialog: Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the
dialog: next day I'm not, one day we're all one
dialog: family, the next day he wants to be
dialog: alone. You tell me.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Is that what he said - he wanted to be
dialog: alone?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked
dialog: me to deliver this.
text: He hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Thanks. he knows I love this, although
dialog: why it couldn't have waited...
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Errand number one - deliver Marge's
dialog: perfume. Errand number two, pack some
text: clothes and his precious saxophone.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: How long's he staying for?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
scene_heading: EXT. MONGIBELLO, BEACH. EARLY MORNING.
text: Marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty,
text: forlorn, a bleached figure on this winter morning.
scene_heading: INT. OFF FROM DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. MORNING.
text: As Ripley walks down the stairs, Marge is at the icebox in
text: the living room. She's fixing herself a drink, has the icebox
text: open for ice. She's ashen, and might have been weeping, walks
text: back into the kitchen area.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: There was a letter from Dickie in with my
dialog: perfume. You realize it's more than a few
dialog: days? He's thinking of moving to Rome.
text: She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling
text: everywhere. Ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear
text: them up. She's got the letter, shows it to Ripley. He puts
text: fresh ice into her glass.
speaker_heading: MARGE (cont'd)
dialog: The thing is, the night before he left,
dialog: we talked about moving, together, going
dialog: North - and I suppose I put some pressure
dialog: on him, about getting married, I just
dialog: might have scared him off. There's a side
dialog: to him, when our heads are on the pillow,
dialog: I know no-one else sees it, which is
dialog: really tender.
dialog: (unravelling)
dialog: I think I should come with you to Rome
text: and just confront him.
text: Ripley lights a cigarette. Marge loses confidence.
speaker_heading: MARGE (cont'd)
text: He hates being confronted.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I think you're right.
scene_heading: INT. ALBERGO GOLDONI, ROME. DAY.
text: RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of
text: this small hotel. He exchanges his passport at the desk for
text: his room key, then makes his way, carrying his own luggage to
text: the metal cage elevator. THIS SCENE INTERCUTS WITH:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL GRAND. DAY.
text: DICKIE'S ARRAY OF LEATHER LUGGAGE is pulled along on a
text: baggage trolley by a liveried PORTER.
text: Dickie's passport slides across the marble desk. A key comes
text: back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive
text: rings. As ALDO, the Front Desk Manager, inspects the
text: passport, he looks at the owner. Ripley wears a terrific
text: suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses. His
text: voice, when he speaks, has the same, lazy, confident drawl.
speaker_heading: ALDO
dialog: Welcome back, Signor Greenleaf.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. DAY.
text: The PORTER takes the cases and opens them as Ripley walks
text: around the suite. It's large and splendid. Ripley breathes in
text: its opulence. He immediately picks up the telephone.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Yes, I'd like you to telephone the Hotel
dialog: Goldoni. Yes. I want to speak to Signor
dialog: Thomas Ripley - No Ripley, R, yes.
dialog: Grazie.
text: He produces Dickie's pen and signs the blotter quickly - <i>H R
text: Greenleaf</i>. Then he pulls out a postcard from the writing
dialog: case to reveal Dickie's <i>Stars, hide your fires</i> handwriting
text: specimen. He compares the two signatures, is pleased.
text: The telephone rings.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (cont'd)
dialog: Pronto? Signor Ripley is not there? I'd
dialog: like to leave a message. Yes. Please call
dialog: Dickie - <i>Dickie Greenleaf</i> - at the Grand.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S HOTEL ROOM, GOLDONI. DAY.
text: A tiny, cell of a room, single bed. Ripley on the phone.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: He's not there? Very well. I'll leave a

dialog: sounds fine. Ripley</i>.
dialog: (listens as it's read back)
dialog: Dinner tonight, yes, is okay. Yes, thank
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. GUCCI STORE, ROME. DAY.
text: Ripley has bought some more LEATHER GOODS - a briefcase and
text: overnight bag. He is at the counter, signing checks.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'd like these to have my initials -
dialog: embossed, I don't know the word in
dialog: Italian ...embossed?
speaker_heading: GUCCI ASSISTANT
text: Embossed, of course, Signor Greenleaf.
text: There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!
text: Shocked, Ripley looks over to find MEREDITH LOGUE outside,
text: alone and delighted to see him. He grins and mouths hello.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: (entering the shop)
dialog: Dickie! Oh my God! Ciao.
scene_heading: EXT. ACROSS PIAZZA NAVONA TO ARCARI'S CAFE. DAY.

speaker_heading: RIPLEY

speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie
dialog: Miles and -
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (interrupting, astonished)
dialog: How did you know that?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (unsettled)
dialog: Is Freddie in Rome?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Now? I don't think so. But I've met him,
dialog: of course, and we've chatted and I know
dialog: about you and Marge and Mongi and what an
dialog: unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you
dialog: were a rat and I thought to myself now I
dialog: know why he travels under R.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So
dialog: the rat's here now, in Rome.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Don't be sorry. I've never been happier.
dialog: I feel like I've been handed a new life.
scene_heading: EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: The truth is if you've had money your
dialog: entire life, even if you despise it,
dialog: which we do - agreed? - you're only truly
dialog: comfortable around other people who have
dialog: it and despise it.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: I've never admitted that to anyone.
scene_heading: INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.
text: Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with
text: him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed
text: by her presence. She goes to the window ahead of him.
text: She takes her money, turns to him.
text: He hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's
text: signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at
text: him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I don't want too many large bills. Nobody
dialog: will change them.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. ANOTHER DAY.
text: Where A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket
text: for Ripley. Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates
text: the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against
dialog: Ripley.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Show me the other one again.
dialog: (the Tailor obliges)
dialog: I like them both.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'll take them both.
text: Ripley goes inside the bedroom to change. While he's inside,
text: Meredith shows the Tailor out. As she returns she notices
text: the open sax case, peers inside.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (O/S)
dialog: I know you're a jazz fiend but do you
dialog: absolutely hate the Opera? I've been
dialog: trying to give my tickets away, it's
dialog: tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be
dialog: dragged...
text: She looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by
text: him, the romance she feels to be in the air.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (emerging)
dialog: You could drag me.
scene_heading: INT. THE OPERA HOUSE, ROME.
text: On stage is Act Two of Eugene Onegin. Lensky sings his aria
text: before the duel with Onegin.
text: Ripley's in a tuxedo, in a box which includes a glamorous
text: Meredith and her AUNT AND UNCLE. He knows what comes next.
text: Lensky is shot by Onegin. Blood pours from his neck into the
text: snow. Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes
text: over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing,
text: kneels holding him... Ripley can barely hide his emotion...
text: Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE THE BOXES, OPERA HOUSE, ROME.
text: The Interval. Ripley and Meredith exit their box with
text: Meredith's Aunt and Uncle (who heads for the interval
dialog: drinks).
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend
dialog: of Freddie's - he has <i>I hate Opera</i>
text: tattooed on his chest.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: There's room for a whole libretto on
text: Freddie's chest.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I'm sure we've met.
text: They reach the console where Uncle Ted has their drinks.
speaker_heading: JOAN (cont'd)
dialog: I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted?
text: This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Thanks, yes, I think we did.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: One minute you people are children and

scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE, FOYER. NIGHT.
text: Ripley heads past the Beautiful People on his hunt for the
text: Men's Room, and walks straight into a young and cultured

speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (as if she's seen a ghost)
dialog: Oh my God. Tom.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Marge, how are you? What are you doing in
dialog: Rome?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: No.
dialog: (to Smith-Kingsley)
dialog: Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about
dialog: you, of course - from Marge, and Dickie.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (works out what's strange)
dialog: No glasses.
text: He fishes out the glasses.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: Ditto.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where are you hiding him? He's
dialog: impossible, isn't he?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Is he really not here?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Marge, you know Dickie has <i>I hate Opera</i>
text: tattooed on his chest.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You were going to Venice.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes, what happened? I heard you were
dialog: desperate to come. I was looking forward
dialog: to rowing you around.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I am. I really am. And I've been
dialog: travelling. I just can't seem to get that
text: far north.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well hurry, before we sink.
dialog: (reaches into his jacket)
dialog: Should I give you my telephone number in
dialog: Venice?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Thanks.
text: The INTERVAL BELL'S ringing. Peter hands over his card to
text: Ripley, sees Meredith.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Look there's Meredith thingy - who's
dialog: that, Marge? - they're in textiles...
dialog: Meredith -
dialog: (embarrassed at not
dialog: remembering)
dialog: God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in
dialog: her house...!
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I don't know her.
dialog: (to Ripley)
dialog: He hasn't called, he's hardly written,
dialog: just these cryptic notes. You don't just
dialog: dump people.
text: The last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Will we see you later?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I can't later.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And tomorrow?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Tomorrow's possible. Do you know
dialog: Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Ten thirty?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We'll be there.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: It's really good to meet you.
scene_heading: INT. BOX, OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: I thought you were enjoying yourself?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Let's take a Carozza and look at the
dialog: moon.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
text: He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading
text: through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting
text: dangerously near as they approach their seats.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the
dialog: two of us.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: (quite taken)
dialog: Okay then, you're crazy.
scene_heading: EXT. CAROZZA, ROME. NIGHT.
text: Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber.
text: Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You're such a pal to understand. It's as
dialog: if Marge is here now - I look at you and
dialog: I see her face - and I can't, whatever
dialog: I'm feeling towards you - I just can't...
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Beating you away.
scene_heading: EXT. MEREDITH'S APARTMENT, ROME.
text: They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment
text: Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go
text: inside, then looks at him.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say
dialog: goodbye in the daylight, properly? So
dialog: it's not just this, it's too...you should
dialog: always save pain for daylight...
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll
dialog: meet you. Let's have coffee in the
text: morning at Dinelli's.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: (fluttering)
dialog: I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Exactly. 10.30 -
dialog: (instantly correcting himself)
dialog: 10.15.
text: He gets back into the carozza. It moves off.
scene_heading: EXT. DINELLI'S CAFE, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. MORNING.
text: Meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the Spanish
text: Steps. Ripley, dressed as Ripley, is at the top of the steps,
text: among early tourists, watching as she drinks her coffee at an
text: outside table. Then Marge and Peter appear walking up the Via
text: Condotti, head for another table, don't see Meredith. She
text: acknowledges Peter who hasn't noticed her.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Peter? Hello, it's Meredith Logue.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Of course it is, Meredith, hello, I'm
dialog: sorry, half-asleep, how are you? This is
dialog: Marge Sherwood. Meredith Logue.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Hello.
text: Hearing Marge's name Meredith reacts, freezes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Join us, won't you? We're just waiting
dialog: for a friend. Do you know, I wonder did
dialog: we see you at the Opera last night?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: I won't actually, although I think this
dialog: might - are you waiting for Dickie?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well no, as it happens, although...
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (stunned at the mention of his
dialog: name)
dialog: Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: You were at the Opera? Well, that
dialog: explains - yes I was there. I was there
dialog: with Dickie.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: I told you! I knew it!
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: (moving over to them)
dialog: Marge, I don't know you, so I have no
dialog: right, but Dickie loves you. He's - I
dialog: think you'll find he's coming home to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (proprietorial)
dialog: How would you know that?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: He told me everything. I was supposed to
dialog: meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I...I'm
dialog: going to go now, I think. Unless he meant
dialog: us to meet - which would be a little
dialog: cruel, wouldn't it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, we're meeting another friend. Tom
dialog: Ripley.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Do you know Tom?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Ripley? No. I heard about him, of course,
dialog: but no, I didn't meet him.
text: The WAITER has arrived to take orders. Meredith indicates
text: she's leaving.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (cont'd)
dialog: Not for me. No, grazie.
text: Marge is on the edge. Peter lays a hand to comfort her.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (cont'd)
dialog: I hope I didn't complicate matters, but
dialog: nothing, nothing untoward happened,
dialog: nothing to prevent you from welcoming him
dialog: back, from marrying him...Goodbye.
dialog: Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.
text: Peter gets up. Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of
text: the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the
text: crowd. He begins the slow walk down towards the square. As he
text: becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry. He's
text: apologising to Marge and Peter as they see him, in his
text: element, lying and believing in his lie.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers.
dialog: Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp
dialog: when they can make you line up for three.
dialog: Have you been waiting long?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Not at all. Morning Tom.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Hi.
dialog: (to Marge)
dialog: Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've
dialog: seen a ghost...
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Dickie was at the Opera last night.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't
dialog: drag Dickie to -
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: He was there with someone. So I suppose
dialog: she must have dragged him - that's not
dialog: fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think
text: Dickie's coming home.
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: I'm going to go home.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Really? That's swell. No, I was just -
dialog: you're way ahead of me! Great!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We think he's had a change of heart.
dialog: (to Marge)
dialog: So we should be celebrating.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I hope so.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (to Marge)
dialog: That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith
dialog: said -
dialog: (to Ripley)
dialog: Meredith's the American girl I saw last
dialog: night, I know her, at the Opera, she's
dialog: been seeing something of Dickie -
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: My God.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But the point is Dickie - well we know
dialog: this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses
text: her and apparently he's come to his
dialog: senses...
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It's fantastic.
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand
dialog: this, but anytime Dickie does something I
dialog: feel guilty.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY.
text: Ripley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo
text: Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley

speaker_heading: SIGNORA BUFFI
dialog: Accendo il riscaldamento.

speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (mimes playing sax)
dialog: Mi piace suonare.

speaker_heading: SIGNORA BUFFI
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una

dialog: <i>(I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So,
dialog: do you like it?)</i>
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.
text: Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas.
text: There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with
text: some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's
text: a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a
text: glass, pours himself a drink.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and
text: precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops
text: playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: FREDDIE (O/S)
dialog: Dickie?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: FREDDIE (O/S)
dialog: It's Freddie. Let me in.
text: RIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE (O/S)
dialog: Dickie, come on, it's me.
text: Ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: (confused, not pleasantly)
dialog: Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at
dialog: dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm.
dialog: If you said he was still at lunch I'd
dialog: believe you. Incredible. The guy has
text: disappeared off the face of the earth.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: The landlady - as far as I could tell,
dialog: the landlady said he was here right now.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I
dialog: can't think why you would imagine Dickie
dialog: would hide from you.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: Because he's been hiding from me - what
dialog: happened at Christmas?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What about Christmas?
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't
dialog: get a cable or a call or a note or,
dialog: frankly, a fart.
text: Ripley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING
text: FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the
text: kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (O/S)
dialog: Of course, he's been very involved in his
dialog: music, hasn't he? I think his theory is,
dialog: you know, you have to go into a cocoon
dialog: before you can become a butterfly.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: Which is horseshit. Have you heard him
dialog: play that thing?
text: (gesturing at the sax on its
dialog: stand)
dialog: He can't.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (O/S)
dialog: (casually)
dialog: How did you find him? It's such an out of
dialog: the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: No thanks.
dialog: (explaining his detective work)
text: Some kid at the American Express Office.
dialog: (he starts to explore)
dialog: Are you living here?
text: Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (returning, flinching)
dialog: No. No, I'm staying here for a few days,
dialog: in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob -
speaker_heading: FREDDIE (O/S)
dialog: Did this place come furnished? It doesn't
dialog: look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so
dialog: bourgeois.
text: Now he's poking at the Hadrian bust.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You should watch that!
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: In fact the only thing which looks like
dialog: Dickie is you.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Hardly.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: Have you done something to your hair?
text: Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Freddie, do you have something to say?
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: What? I think I'm saying it. Something's
text: going on. He's either converted to
dialog: Christianity - or to something else.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself.
text: Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the
dialog: Corso.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: Is it on <i>"delle Croce, just off the
dialog: Corso"</i>? You're a quick study, aren't you?
dialog: Last time you didn't know your ass from
dialog: your elbow, now you're giving me
dialog: directions. That's not fair, you probably
dialog: do know your ass from your elbow. I'll
dialog: see you.
text: AND HE'S GONE. Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner
text: on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back
text: to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.
scene_heading: INT. LANDING AND STAIRS, RIPLEY'S BUILDING. LATE DAY.
text: FREDDIE IS BACK IN CONVERSATION WITH SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
text: can't make out the text but there's some discussion about
text: <i>Signor Greenleaf</i> and <i>Signor Ripley</i>. Ripley hurries inside as
text: Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. LATE DAY.
text: Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open. As he marches
text: in, he launches into his interrogation.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: Ripley? There's someth -
text: - AND WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF HADRIAN WHICH RIPLEY
text: SWINGS AT HIM, HOLDING ON AWKWARDLY WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE
text: HEAVY MARBLE SCULPTURE.
text: Freddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then
text: to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating
text: him downwards. As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his
text: balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before
text: slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.
text: THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF.
scene_heading: EXT. PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.
text: It's deserted. Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows
text: towards the car. A couple walk across the square. Ripley
text: talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor. He
text: pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (mimicking Freddie's voice)
dialog: Hey, if I'm drunk, think what her
dialog: husband's saying.
scene_heading: EXT. VIA APPIA ANTICA. NIGHT.
text: The Fiat noses along THE APPIAN WAY. Black fragments of tombs
text: punctuate either side of the poorly lit road. Inside the car,
text: Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body.
text: He slows near a clump of trees.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. EVENING.
text: Someone is KNOCKING urgently at the door. Ripley opens it,
text: finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and TWO
text: POLICEMEN. One of them offers his hand.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Dickie Greenleaf?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. EVENING.
text: Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini
text: and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did
dialog: Signor Miles leave yesterday?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd
dialog: both taken on far too many drinks - but
dialog: it was dark, it was certainly dark when I
text: walked him down to his car.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: So Signor Miles drove away and you did
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but
dialog: I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks.
dialog: I've suffered all day. Who found him?
text: Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Senta. We have to ask you to stay in
dialog: Rome.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: So, the Doctor, he has to make the -
dialog: (looks at Baggio)
dialog: - come se dice?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Postmortem?
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Yes, exactly, but his first, his first
dialog: conclusion was that Signor Miles was
dialog: killed not later than seven o'clock
dialog: yesterday evening.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he
text: drove off in his car.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: No.
scene_heading: EXT. NARROW STREET, THE GHETTO, ROME. MORNING.
text: Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his
text: scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES
text: AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances
text: sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images
text: and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE
text: WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the
text: pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along
text: the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an
text: Italian, runs up concerned.
scene_heading: EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY.
text: Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the
text: street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips
text: Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter.
text: Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no
dialog: mood for pleasantries.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Did he kill Freddie?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Marge, when did you get here?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I tried again, waiting here, watching for
dialog: him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look
dialog: for Dickie I find you.
dialog: (focusing on Ripley's cuts and
dialog: bruises)
dialog: What happened to your face?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Dickie did it.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (suddenly tense)
dialog: Dickie?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: My face! There was an argument. I said
dialog: some things I shouldn't have. About you.
dialog: About the appalling way he's treating
dialog: you, all of us. And the next thing I
dialog: know he's launched himself at me.
text: (he pulls the scooter off the
dialog: stand)
dialog: Are you getting on?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Get on. I'll take you to him.
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. DAY.
text: Ripley and Marge come round the corner on the scooter. The
text: entrance to the Palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars.
text: Inspector Roverini emerges from one of them. Ripley,
text: startled, drives straight past the entrance.
scene_heading: EXT. ROME STREET, BY THE RIVER. DAY.
text: Ripley pulls up several hundred yards later, in a different
text: piazza full of book stalls. Marge is confused.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Where does Dickie live?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: We passed it a few blocks back, where the
dialog: police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They
dialog: don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not
dialog: going to incriminate Dickie -
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (thinking hard, distracted)
dialog: No, well go if you want to, but don't
dialog: talk to the Police about my face - they
dialog: find out he hit me - he's got a temper - he
dialog: could've hit Freddie.
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you
dialog: later.
text: And he drives off. At the first opportunity HE DOUBLES BACK
text: and roars towards the Palazzo.
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. AFTERNOON.
text: Ripley drives towards the entrance. As Ripley gets off and
text: pushes his scooter through the doorway SOME JOURNALISTS,
text: LOITERING INSIDE A BARBER'S SHOP come running out and swarm
text: around him with questions about Freddie. One of them gets off
text: a photograph. It's chaos, a Police Officer shouts him away
text: as Ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE AND STAIRS, PALAZZO GIOIA. CONTINUOUS.
text: As Ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting
text: more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell. On a
text: landing is Roverini. Ripley hurries towards him.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Can we go up? Do you mind?
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Of course. What happened to your face?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
text: My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by
dialog: photographers.
text: He hurries up the stairs, Roverini in tow.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (cont'd)
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm
dialog: feeling hounded - do you think you could
dialog: not give out my address?
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Never. We've had many requests and, of
dialog: course, we say no - even to your fiancÈe.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I really don't want to see anybody.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Even your fiancÈe...?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Even her.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: What about Thomas Ripley?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What about Ripley?
text: Ripley's way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment.
text: He waits nervously for Roverini. He unlocks the door and can
text: barely wait for Roverini to catch up.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.
text: Roverini follows Ripley inside, Baggio hurries in behind him.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo,
dialog: is that right?
text: Ripley is appalled. He smiles.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That
dialog: was months ago.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: November, I thought.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: November 7th is my information.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I don't remember the exact date.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: A few days ago.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Does he stay with you here?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago
dialog: Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your
text: apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a
text: little boat is found in San Remo full of
text: rocks, and the owner tells the Police it
dialog: was stolen on November 7th. We look at
dialog: hotel records and we see <i>oh! Dickie
dialog: Greenleaf is staying in San Remo</i> and then
dialog: our boatman remembers two Americans
text: taking a boat.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence.
dialog: There must be fifty hotels in San Remo,
dialog: there must have been a hundred people
text: renting a boat on that day.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: 31 people.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: 31 people.
text: Baggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge
dialog: Sherwood.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (appalled, defeated)
dialog: Let her in, what's the difference? Let
dialog: her in.
text: (Baggio is on his way to the
dialog: door.)
dialog: No, actually, no, I'd like it very much
dialog: if you would ask her to come back later.
text: Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (cont'd)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: (watching him)
dialog: May I ask...why would you speak to your
dialog: friend and not your fiancÈe?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I think I just said. Ripley was handling
dialog: some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley
dialog: want to marry me. Nor did he ask me
dialog: every day if I would marry him. And when.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Do you have a photograph of Signor
dialog: Ripley?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'm not in the habit of carrying around
dialog: photographs of my male friends.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Now I think I have upset you. My English
dialog: perhaps is coarse.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It is a little coarse, yes.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Sorry. No-one has seen Signor Ripley
dialog: since San -
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I have!
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: You have, yes.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask
dialog: her! and if I could remember which hotel
dialog: he was staying at - <i>the Goldoni!</i> - Tom
dialog: was staying at the Goldoni.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A
dialog: coincidence.
dialog: (he gets up to leave)
dialog: I look forward to our next meeting when I
dialog: will be more careful with my English and
dialog: persuade you to play me your saxophone.
dialog: Alto.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI
dialog: (suddenly turning)
dialog: I have a witness who thinks they saw two
text: men getting into Mr Miles' car. She
dialog: wants to identify you in a - <i>confronto</i> -
dialog: line-up.
dialog: (ominously)
dialog: Tomorrow then?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (thrown, scrabbling)
dialog: Tomorrow.
text: Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through
text: the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: ROVERINI (O/S)
dialog: <i>Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood. He's in but I
dialog: really don't think he wants to see
dialog: anyone.</i>
text: Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then
text: suddenly a voice shocks him upright.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Dick? Dickie? I know you can hear me.
dialog: What am I doing, chasing you around...?
dialog: I was going to say I would count to three
dialog: and if you didn't open the door, but I
dialog: won't count any more. On you. I won't
dialog: count on you any more. Whatever it is,
dialog: whatever you've done or haven't done,
dialog: you've broken my heart. That's one thing
dialog: I know you're guilty of, and I don't know
dialog: why, I don't know why, I just don't know
dialog: why...
text: Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as
text: they ring out on the stone stairs. The tapping sound resolves
text: into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.
text: Ripley's at the typewriter, he begins to type.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (O/S)
dialog: <i>My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this.
dialog: Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought
dialog: about going to the police, but I can't do
dialog: it, I can't face it. I can't face
dialog: anything anymore...</i>
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.
text: CHAOS. Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes,
text: dividing them into TWO PILES - one for Dickie's trunk, one
text: for his own battered suitcase. He puts the license plates
text: from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage. He has placed one
text: shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing
text: Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks
text: it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek.
text: He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and
text: needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. Dickie's
text: leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff
text: links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he
text: opens to scratch at the photograph, obliterating the face.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (O/S)
dialog: <i>...I wish I could give you the life I
dialog: took for granted. You've always
dialog: understood what's at the heart of me,
dialog: Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's
dialog: why I'm writing this to you, the brother
dialog: I never had. The only true friend I ever
dialog: had. In all kinds of ways you're much
dialog: more like the son my father always
dialog: wanted. I realise you can change the
dialog: people, change the scenery, but you can't
dialog: change your own rotten self. Now I can't
dialog: think what to do, or where to go. I'm
dialog: haunted by everything I've done, and
dialog: can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on.
dialog: I've made a mess of being Dickie
dialog: Greenleaf haven't I?</i>
text: He's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope
text: marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano
text: next to Dickie's passport. His head is reflected in the
text: distorting curve of the lid. As he puts on his glasses
text: there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating,
text: as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.
text: Ripley carries Dickie's luggage down into THE COMMUNAL
text: BASEMENT of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and
text: gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments. A red plush
text: couch sits on top of a mound of furniture. He finds some
text: dustsheets and shoves the cases under them. Then Dickie's
dialog: saxophone.
text: Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the
text: revolving blue light of a Police Car. He shrinks back, turns
text: off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated
text: fitfully by the strobe of cold blue.
scene_heading: EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA, ROME. NIGHT.
text: Ripley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the
text: entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the
text: police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off
text: into the darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.
text: Ripley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley,
text: hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZALE ROMA, VENICE. DAWN.
text: Ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a
text: MOTOR TAXI as it surges towards Venice at dawn. Peter Smith-
text: Kingsley waits on the quay. Ripley waves. Peter waves back.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (indicating the taxi stop)
dialog: I'll see you over there!
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. EARLY MORNING.
text: Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons
text: scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful
dialog: grey.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Peter, I'm really sorry to put you
dialog: through this. I just couldn't face going
dialog: to the police by myself when my Italian's
dialog: so rotten.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted
dialog: you finally made it to Venice. I'm
dialog: delighted, contrary to rumour, you're
dialog: still in one piece?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What rumour?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That Dickie murdered you and is
dialog: travelling under your passport. I know,
dialog: ridiculous.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION, VENICE. LATE DAY.
text: Later. Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station,
dialog: where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being
text: processed. The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a
text: horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in
text: conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley
dialog: waits.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Welcome to Venice. This place reeks,
dialog: doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh.
dialog: Sorry. Not the best way to spend your
dialog: first day.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Anyway I've got to the bottom of the
dialog: delay. Finally. We're waiting for
dialog: someone from Rome.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (completely thrown)
dialog: What do you mean? They're sending
dialog: someone from Rome?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's good, isn't it?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (as if suffocating)
dialog: No, but I thought that didn't happen in
dialog: Italy, that each region was completely
dialog: separate! I was sure that was the -
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You've seen the papers, you know what a
dialog: big deal it's been here. American tourist
dialog: murdered -
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned
dialog: the stench I can hardly breathe.
text: A door opens. COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a
text: sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.
text: Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini. A POLICEMAN
text: introduces him.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di
dialog: Roma.
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: (to Peter, in Italian)
dialog: Qui e Ripley? <i>Who is Ripley?</i>
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (in Italian)
dialog: Lui. <i>Him.</i>
text: Verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview
text: room at the back of the station. His manner is ominous.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM, VENICE. LATE DAY.
text: This room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a
text: locked area for cells at one wall. A small, sour window
text: gives onto a canal. The main station is glimpsed through
text: some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through.
text: Verrecchia sits down. Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian,
text: during which Peter translates.
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in
dialog: seguito alla negativa valutazione delle
dialog: disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con
dialog: il mio predecessore Roverini che come e
dialog: noto non e riuscito a impedire il
dialog: verificarsi della scomparsa del signor
dialog: Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona
dialog: al momento passibile di incriminazione
dialog: del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (translating)
dialog: He's taken over the case because...
dialog: they're annoyed the previous chap let
dialog: Dickie...disappear when he was the only,
dialog: he was the only suspect in Freddie's
dialog: murder.
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il
dialog: signor Ripley ha visto il signor
dialog: Greenleaf?
dialog: <i>(When was the last time Ripley saw
dialog: Greenleaf?)</i>
text: Ripley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and
dialog: answers.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: In Rome, about three weeks ago.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I knew that one.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (giving Ripley a look)
dialog: A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (translating)
dialog: Where have you been since then?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I've been backpacking.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't know how to translate that.
dialog: (he tries)
dialog: E difficile....il signor Ripley
dialog: ....dormiva all'aperto, con un...
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze
dialog: omosessuali?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you a homosexual?
dialog: (then as himself)
dialog: Interesting non-sequitur.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (translates for him)
dialog: No.
dialog: (as Peter, drily)
dialog: By the way, officially there are no
dialog: Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo,
dialog: Michelangelo very inconvenient.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Tell him I have a fiancÈe, Dickie has a
dialog: fiancÈe and Freddie Miles probably had a
dialog: string of them.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (translating)
dialog: Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il
dialog: signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e
dialog: probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha
dialog: molte fidanzate.
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Mamma mia, quante fidanzate!
text: They all laugh.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He says <i>so many fiancÈes</i>.
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: (suddenly very tough)
dialog: Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo
dialog: Dickie Greenleaf! Vero?
text: As Peter translates Verrecchia watches intently.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He wants to know if you killed Freddie
dialog: Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: No I did not. I did not kill Freddie
text: Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is
dialog: he accusing me?
dialog: (Peter clearly doesn't ask)
dialog: Ask him if he's accusing me!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He's already angry, I don't think -
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (interrupting, heated)
dialog: Just because he doesn't like Americans!
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: Non e questo il luogo per le vostre
dialog: conversazioni private! <i>(This is not the
dialog: place for your private conversations)</i>
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (appeasing him)
dialog: A ragione. A ragione. <i>(You're right.
dialog: You're right.)</i>
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: Hmm. C'e questa... <i>(There's this...)</i>
text: Verrecchia hands over a letter. It's opened. Ripley's name on
text: the outside. Ripley stares at it.
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: Questa lettera e stata trovata
dialog: nell'abitazione del signor Richard
dialog: Greenleaf a Roma.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: They found this in Dickie's place in
dialog: Rome.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You opened this?
speaker_heading: VERRECCHIA
dialog: Of course!
text: He stands and takes the letter out. Begins to read. He has
text: the look of a man whose privacy has been violated.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (to Peter)
text: It's a suicide note.
dialog: (to Verrecchia)
dialog: You ask me all these questions and you've
dialog: already read this suicide note?
scene_heading: INT. PETER SMITH-KINGSLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.
text: There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of
text: performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING. Peter is an
text: opera repetiteur. Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing
text: from the score of Vivaldi's <i>Stabat Mater</i>. Peter's made supper.
text: He's setting the table.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill
dialog: Freddie, what must that be like? To wake
dialog: up every morning, how can you? Just wake
dialog: up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Whatever you do, however terrible,
text: however hurtful - it all makes sense,
dialog: doesn't it? inside your head. You never
dialog: meet anybody who thinks they're a bad
dialog: person or that they're cruel.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But you're still tormented, you must be,
dialog: you've killed somebody...
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Don't you put the past in a room, in the
dialog: cellar, and lock the door and just never
dialog: go in there? Because that's what I do.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Probably. In my case it's probably a
dialog: whole building.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Then you meet someone special and all you
dialog: want to do is toss them the key, say <i>open
dialog: up, step inside</i>, but you can't because
dialog: it's dark and there are demons and if
dialog: anybody saw how ugly it was...
text: Peter's come over, stands behind him over the piano.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's the music talking. Harder to be
dialog: bleak if you're playing <i>Knees up Mother
dialog: Brown</i>.
text: He vamps this vaudeville song over Ripley's shoulder.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I keep wanting to do that - fling open
dialog: the door - let the light in, clean
dialog: everything out. If I could get a huge
dialog: eraser and rub everything out...starting
dialog: with myself...the thing is, Peter, if...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (as Ripley falls silent)
dialog: No key, huh?
scene_heading: INT. SANTA MARIA DELLA PIETA, BRIDGE OF SIGHS. DAY.
text: A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER.
text: A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church. The
text: orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the
dialog: organ.
text: Ripley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and
text: listens. Peter sees him, smiles. Ripley smiles back.
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE, S.LUCIA RAILWAY STATION. DAY.
text: MARGE appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag. Ripley
text: and Peter have come to meet her.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (kissing him warmly)
dialog: Hello Peter, so good to see you.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Hello Marge!
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: Tom.
text: They walk towards the Vaporetto.
speaker_heading: MARGE (cont'd)
dialog: So you found Peter...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I think we sort of found each other.
text: Marge smiles enigmatically. Ripley registers.
speaker_heading: PETER (cont'd)
dialog: Where's Dickie's father?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: He's not coming till the morning.
dialog: Evidently his stomach - I don't think the
dialog: food here is agreeing with him.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I was looking forward to seeing him.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of
dialog: that. There's a private detective on the
dialog: case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's
dialog: father's employing him.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: That's a terrific idea.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: He's American. He's already discovered
dialog: Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day
dialog: before he disappeared.
text: They step onto the Vaporetto.
speaker_heading: MARGE (cont'd)
dialog: Is that what you do before you jump in
dialog: the Tiber? I don't think so.
scene_heading: EXT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.
text: The boat arrives at the entrance to the house. Peter opens
text: the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: Is this you?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Golly. Who's paying for this?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Peter found it for me. I can afford it
text: because it's damp and, and falling down.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.
text: Marge, entering the living room, is astonished at its
text: grandeur. She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: This is spectacular.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's
dialog: better than squeezing into my room, and I
dialog: know how you hate hotels.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: A hotel would've been fine.
dialog: (to Ripley)
dialog: We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far
text: his dollar has stretched.
text: Ripley is shaking a martini. Marge laughs, helpless, somehow
text: raging. Peter turns
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What's funny?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when
dialog: Tom arrived in Mongi.
dialog: (to Ripley)
dialog: And now look at you.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Look at me what?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: To the manner born.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. DAY.
text: St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon
text: sellers - a man playing saxophone. HERBERT GREENLEAF sits out
text: in the colonade on one of the many tables at Florian's Cafe,
text: cradling a glass of hot water. He gets up as Marge and Ripley
dialog: arrive.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Mr Greenleaf.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: Tom. How are you? You look well.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'm well, thank you.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF

speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Yes it is.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
text: Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Very.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: And you, sir? Any better?
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
text: Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Where's Mr MacCarron?
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well,
dialog: my boy, it's come to a pretty pass,
dialog: hasn't it?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Yes. What's the detective hoping to
dialog: find in San Remo?
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: He's being thorough, that's all. I'm
dialog: learning about my son, Tom, now he's
dialog: missing. I'm learning a great deal about
dialog: him. I hope you can fill in some more
dialog: blanks for me. Marge has been good enough
dialog: to do that, about Mongibello.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do
dialog: anything to help Dickie.
text: Marge looks at him in contempt.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: This theory, the letter he left for you,
dialog: the Police think that's a clear
dialog: indication he was planning on doing
dialog: something...to himself.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I just don't believe that!
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk
dialog: to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon?
dialog: Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say
dialog: to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to
dialog: another fellow -
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Such as?
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: What a waste of lives and opportunities
dialog: and -
text: A saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza. Greenleaf
text: suddenly explodes.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF

scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: (reading, plunging into gloom)

speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I think it might hurt her to know.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: And his passport photo? Did you hear? To

dialog: Well, if we all pushed him away what
dialog: about him pushing us away? You've been a
dialog: great friend to my son. Everything is
dialog: someone else's fault. We all want to sow
dialog: wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the
dialog: word?
dialog: (Ripley shakes his head)
text: The moment someone confronts him he
text: lashes out. He lashes out. You know,
dialog: people always say you can't choose your
dialog: parents, but you can't choose your
dialog: children.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DUSK.
text: Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head
text: full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in
text: sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY
text: SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter
dialog: and Marge.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have
text: fallen asleep.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Did Dickie's Dad go?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
text: He's having an early night.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Poor man.
dialog: (she heads to her room)
dialog: We were knocking on that door for ever.
text: (she fiddles inside the sleeve
dialog: of her dress)
dialog: I think I've broken my strap.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Not guilty.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'll fix some drinks.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You <i>walk</i> in Venice!
text: She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear,
text: then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley,
text: a little concerned.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: (a hand on his shoulder)
dialog: Do you want me to stick around?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Or I could come back.
text: Ripley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his
text: pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles.
speaker_heading: PETER (cont'd)
dialog: Your key.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S BATHROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.
text: Ripley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door.
speaker_heading: MARGE (O/S)
dialog: Tom?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
speaker_heading: MARGE (O/S)
dialog: Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
text: Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around
text: his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's
text: slightly breathless.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I found Dickie's rings.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You've got Dickie's rings.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I can explain.
text: He can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Dickie promised me he would never take
dialog: off this ring.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Let me put on some clothes and then we
dialog: can talk about this.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to
dialog: tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr
dialog: Greenleaf.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Marge, calm down, you're being
text: hysterical.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: He promised me. <i>I swear I'll never take
dialog: off this ring until the day -</i>
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Shut up! Shut up!
text: His towel slips off from his waist.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (cont'd)
dialog: I'm wet, Marge, I've lost my towel, I'd
dialog: really like to put my clothes on. So go
dialog: and pour us both a drink, will you?
text: She goes off obediently, a zombie. He shuts the door.
text: Immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to
text: kill Marge with. He's got a shoe but it feels too light. He
text: opens cabinets, drawers - nail scissors, nothing - then
text: picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S SITTING ROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.
text: Marge is leaving, coat on, as Ripley comes out of the
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Marge? Where are you going?
speaker_heading: MARGE
text: (like a creature caught in
dialog: headlights)
dialog: I was looking for a needle and thread. I
dialog: wasn't snooping. I was looking for a
text: needle and thread to mend my bra.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: The scent you're wearing. I bought it for
dialog: you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie.
dialog: So many things. The day he was late back
dialog: from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he
dialog: was with another girl. I'm not talking
dialog: about Meredith, another girl we met in a
dialog: bar. He couldn't be faithful for five
dialog: minutes. So when he makes a promise it
dialog: doesn't mean what it means when you make
dialog: a promise. Or I do. He has so many
text: realities, Dickie, and he believes them
dialog: all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half
text: the time he doesn't even realize.
text: A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe. As
text: he speaks the stain spreads. He looks at it absently.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (cont'd)
dialog: Today, for the first time, I've even
dialog: wondered whether he might have killed
dialog: Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody
dialog: contradicted him - well, you know that.
dialog: Marge. I loved you - you might as well
dialog: know - I loved you, and because he knew I
dialog: loved you, he let you think I loved him.
dialog: Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't
dialog: know, maybe it's grotesque to say this
dialog: now, so just write it on a piece of paper
dialog: or something, and keep it in your purse
dialog: for a rainy day. <i>Tom loves me.</i>
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (as if she'd heard nothing)
dialog: Why do you have Dickie's rings?
text: His hand goes to his pocket. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I told you. He gave them to me.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Why? When?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I feel as if you haven't heard anything
dialog: I've been saying to you.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I don't believe you.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: It's all true.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I don't believe a single word you've
dialog: said.
text: Marge is shivering. Ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You're shivering, Marge. Can I hold you?
dialog: Would you let me hold you?
text: Marge panics, backed up against the door. She screams and
text: turns straight into the arms of a startled PETER who's come
text: back to visit Ripley, and is unlocking the door.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (sobbing uncontrollably)
dialog: Oh Peter! Get me out of here.
text: Ripley storms off. His hand comes out of his pocket COVERED
text: IN BLOOD from the razor. Peter notices, appalled.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Tom, are you okay?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You try. You try talking to her.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (calls after him)
dialog: Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (not turning around)
dialog: I give up.
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You can't be angry with her. She's upset
dialog: and needs someone to blame. So she blames
dialog: you. I'll go home and talk to her. As
dialog: for you - either get a safety razor or
text: grow a beard.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, EUROPA REGINA HOTEL, VENICE. MORNING.
text: Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance.
scene_heading: INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S SUITE, EUROPA REGINA. DAY.
text: Ripley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't
text: recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the
dialog: private investigator.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Is Mr Greenleaf here?
speaker_heading: MACCARRON
dialog: Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
speaker_heading: MARGE (O/S)
dialog: <i>I don't know, I don't know, I just know
dialog: it.</i>
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
speaker_heading: (O/S)
dialog: <i>Marge, there's female intuition, and
dialog: then there are facts -</i>
text: Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back,
text: as if newly-widowed. THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE
speaker_heading: TABLE.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: Tom.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Hello, sir.
text: (smiles thinly at Marge)
dialog: Marge, you should have waited, didn't
dialog: Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you
dialog: up?
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: Marge has been telling us about the
dialog: rings.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You know I feel ridiculous I didn't
dialog: mention them yesterday - I clean forgot -
dialog: ridiculous.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: Perhaps you didn't mention them because
text: there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
text: Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf
text: heads into his bedroom.
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: I'm going to take Marge for a little
dialog: walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (feeling caged in)
dialog: We could go down to the bar - no need for
dialog: you to -
scene_heading: HERBERT GREENLEAF
dialog: No, he should talk to you alone.
text: He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS
text: PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks
text: out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and
text: indifferent view.
scene_heading: EXT. EUROPA REGINA, THE GREENLEAF TERRACE. DAY.
text: Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I could probably see my bedroom from
dialog: here. I can see my house. When you see
dialog: where you live from a distance it's like
dialog: a dream, isn't it?
speaker_heading: MACCARRON
dialog: (coming out)
dialog: I don't care for B.S. I don't care to
dialog: hear it. I don't care to speak it.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MACCARRON
dialog: Why do you think Dickie's father sent him
dialog: to Europe in the first place? Did you
dialog: know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-
dialog: killed a boy?
text: Ripley turns, shocked.
speaker_heading: MACCARRON
dialog: (cont'd)
text: At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the
text: kid several times in the head. Put him in
text: the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in
text: his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to
dialog: ask Mr Greenleaf.
text: MacCarron gets up.
speaker_heading: MACCARRON
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: Nor did they think to check whether a
dialog: Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at
dialog: Princeton University. I turned up a Tom
dialog: Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the
dialog: music department.
text: Ripley's head drops.
speaker_heading: MACCARRON
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: See - in America we're taught to check a
dialog: fact before it becomes a fact. We're
text: taught to nose around when a girl drowns
dialog: herself, find out if that girl was
dialog: pregnant, find out if Dickie had an
dialog: embarrassment there.
text: Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going.
speaker_heading: MACCARRON
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
dialog: He really does. Marge, she's got a
dialog: hundred theories, but there are a few
dialog: things she doesn't know. We hope she
dialog: never knows.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I hope she never knows.
speaker_heading: MACCARRON
dialog: Three different people saw Dickie get
text: into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't
dialog: identify himself because he was jumping
dialog: someone else's wife at the time saw
text: Dickie removing license plates from a red
dialog: sports car. The Police know about this
text: man because he happens to be a Policeman.
text: He walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES
text: from Freddie's car.
speaker_heading: MACCARRON
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: I found these in the basement of Dickie's
dialog: apartment. They belonged to Freddie's
dialog: car. Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose
dialog: them in the canal this evening.
text: Ripley can't believe what he's hearing. It's like a dream.
speaker_heading: MACCARRON
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a
dialog: silent promise in Dickie's letter to you
dialog: which he intends to honor. He intends to
dialog: transfer a good part of Dickie's income
dialog: from his trust into your name. He doesn't
dialog: intend to give the Italian police any
dialog: information about Dickie's past. He's
dialog: rather hoping you'll feel the same.
text: There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.
scene_heading: EXT. EUROPA REGINA MOORING. DAY.
text: Ripley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the
text: water's edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling. They shake hands, and
text: then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch. Herbert
text: Greenleaf carries the saxophone case.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (to Marge)
dialog: I feel I never should have said those
dialog: things to you the other evening. I was
dialog: pretty flustered, the rings and - and you
dialog: looked so, I don't know.
text: Marge shakes her head to silence him.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY (cont'd)
dialog: But I hope that note goes to New York in
dialog: your purse, for a rainy day.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: What are you going to do now, Tom?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I don't know. Peter has a concert in
dialog: Athens next month - and he's asked if I
dialog: want to go along, help out. He says
dialog: goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal,
dialog: otherwise -
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Why do I think there's never been a
dialog: Ripley rainy day?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (lunging at him)
dialog: I know it was you - I know it was you,
dialog: Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed
dialog: Dickie. I know it was you.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Oh Marge.
text: He puts his hand out to control her. She pushes it away.
text: STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM, the frustration too much, so that
text: Ripley has to cover his face. MacCarron comes off the boat to
text: restrain her. Ripley looks at him as if to say: <i>what can you
text: do, she's hysterical.</i> MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the
text: boat. Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily. Turns away.
text: They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off
text: towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.
scene_heading: EXT. FERRY FOR ATHENS, NAPLES. DAY.
text: A week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the
text: ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece. They're
text: laughing.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Ask me what I want to change about this
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What do you want to change about this
dialog: moment?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S CABIN. DUSK.
text: Peter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his
text: traveller's cheques. Ripley knocks on the door, comes in.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hello. What are you up to?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: All kinds of things. Making plans.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans
dialog: for the future?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I don't know. Both. My plan right now is
text: to go up on deck, look at the sunset.
dialog: Come with me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You go. I don't want to get dressed yet.
dialog: Come back though. Come back.
dialog: (smiles at him)
dialog: You know, you look so relaxed, like a
dialog: completely different person.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Well, that's entirely your fault. And,
dialog: if I fall overboard, that'll be your
dialog: fault too.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK OF THE HELLENES. SUNSET.
text: Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.
text: Then a voice shakes him from his reverie.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Dickie? Dickie?
text: He turns. He's caught. Suddenly he's Dickie.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (cont'd)
dialog: Dickie, my God!
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Hello Meredith.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: I was looking at you, your clothes, I
dialog: wouldn't have known you...
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Well, you've spotted me and so you get
dialog: the reward.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Just kidding. Are you alone?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
text: Meredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER
text: COUPLES are walking around the deck.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Of course. Aunt Joan.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've
dialog: thought about you so much.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I've thought about you.
dialog: And now he's thinking <i>I can't kill them all...</i>
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: When I thought about you I was mostly
dialog: hating you. Where've you been hiding?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I haven't been hiding. I've been in
dialog: Police custody. They've been trying to
text: flush out Freddie's killer.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: They're letting me have this vacation.
dialog: Which is why the get-up. Which is why you
dialog: haven't heard from me.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: You know, the whole world thinks you
dialog: killed Freddie? It's terrible.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later.
dialog: Later?
text: He kisses her. Full of future.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: So - are you travelling under R?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You know what - I am.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: Dickie, are you with Peter Smith-
dialog: Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought
text: she saw him.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him
dialog: in months. No, I'm alone.
dialog: (and he understands this is not
dialog: any kind of lie)
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S CABIN. NIGHT.
text: Peter's working on his score, lying on his front, apparently
text: engrossed. Ripley knocks and enters. Looks long at Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How was it?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Good. But I think we should stay in here
dialog: for the rest of the trip.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Was that Meredith?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Was who Meredith?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Meredith Logue. You were kissing
dialog: somebody. Looked like Meredith.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
text: Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Didn't look that way - you know - from a
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why lie?
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Dickie and Peter, that's just too good
dialog: gossip, isn't it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Or <i>Tom</i> and Peter even.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Well that would be even better gossip.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Really, why?
dialog: (completely lost)
dialog: Sorry, I'm completely lost.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be
dialog: stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's
dialog: my, that's my - terrible and alone and
dialog: dark - and I've lied about who I am, and
dialog: where I am, and so nobody can ever find
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What do you mean <i>lied about who you are?</i>
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: I suppose I always thought - better to be
dialog: a fake somebody than a real nobody.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What are you talking about - you're not a
dialog: nobody! That's the last thing you are.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: Peter, I... I...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (conciliatory)
dialog: And don't forget. I have the key.
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: You have the key. Tell me some good
dialog: things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up.
dialog: Just tell me some nice things.
text: He sits on the bed, leans against Peter. His eyes are
text: brimming with tears. He takes the cord from Peter's robe and
text: begins twisting it in his hands.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take
dialog: some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is
dialog: tender... Tom is beautiful...
speaker_heading: RIPLEY
dialog: (during this, and tender)
dialog: You're such a liar...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: ...Tom is a mystery...
text: Ripley is pressing against him, moving up his body, kisses
text: his shoulder, the cord wrapped tight in his hands...
scene_heading: INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. NIGHT.
text: Ripley returns to his cabin. Sits on the bed, desolate.
speaker_heading: PETER (O/S)
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: <i>...Tom is not a nobody. Tom has secrets
dialog: he doesn't want to tell me, and I wish he
dialog: would. Tom has nightmares. That's not a
dialog: good thing. Tom has someone to love him.
dialog: That is a good thing!
text: (feeling Ripley's weight on
dialog: him)
dialog: Tom is crushing me. Tom is crushing me.
dialog: (suddenly alarmed)
dialog: Tom, you're crushing me!</i>
text: The door of his closet flips open with the swell and he
text: catches his reflection. It swings shut. Open then shut.
text: Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light
text: dies. There's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the
text: round glass. Ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making.
text: THE END.
dialog: <i>Lullaby for Cain</i>
