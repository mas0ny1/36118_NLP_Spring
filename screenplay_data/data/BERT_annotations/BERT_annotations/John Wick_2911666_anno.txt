scene_heading: EXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUPER: ARDMORE, PENNSYLVANIA
dialog: 
text: A verdant landscape of rolling hills, lush countryside, and
dialog: ambient peace.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE WICK HOME - ESTABLISHING - EARLY DAY
dialog: 
text: A small, quaint, two-bedroom farmhouse: a classic. Nearby, a
text: small barn -its paint chipped, wood worn- sits nestled within
text: the setting. The homestead feels slightly abandoned, the
text: facade -especially the roof- in dire need of an overhaul.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The hour hand of an old, electric clock shifts slightly,
text: marking six a.m. A soft alarm sounds. Beneath the blankets,
text: a body shifts, a weathered hand reaching out to silence the
dialog: antique.
dialog: 
text: A beat... a sigh... a groan... and JOHN WICK -early sixties,
dialog: salt-and-pepper hair, three-day beard, former boxer, former
text: military, tired, beaten down, and at wit's end- sits up,
text: staring unblinkingly out at the day.
dialog: 
text: A beat... and he stands, donning a weathered robe and a pair
text: of slippers. John stuffs his hands into his pockets...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: ...and shuffles down the corridor, the walls overflowing with
text: family pictures, each badly in need of dusting. They
dialog: catalogue a long and healthy life with his wife, Norma; the
text: pictures presenting a time line of sorts. No children, yet
text: sheer, unadulterated happiness.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: As John makes his way through his home, we can see that it is
text: cluttered and unorganized. Dirty, in fact, as if it hasn't
dialog: been cleaned in months.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE WICK HOME - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: John opens the door, retrieves the newspaper, closes, and
text: locks the door behind him, without giving the outside so much
text: as a glance.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: John unceremoniously tosses the newspaper onto the table,
text: opens a cupboard, and measures out a couple of tablespoons of
text: Folgers Coffee into an old percolator.
dialog: 
text: As it begins to bubble, John open the fridge, studies its
text: contents for a moment or two, and then closes it, abandoning
dialog: the thought of breakfast.
dialog: 
text: He pours himself a cup of coffee and sits at the table. The
text: newspaper is ignored. He drinks in silence for a long, dark,
text: brooding moment, the loneliness almost unsettling.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the phone on the wall RINGS.
dialog: 
text: John lowers his cup, staring at the device, his eyes tired.
text: A beat... and he stands, walking slowly to answer it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This is John.
dialog: 
text: As he listens to the voice on the other end, John remains
text: still... stoic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Ok.
dialog: 
text: John hangs up the phone and returns to the table, sinking
text: slowly down into his chair.
dialog: 
dialog: A long beat...
dialog: 
text: ...and John begins to weep, his hands trembling as he lowers
text: his face in excruciating, utter, and complete sorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE TO:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE BARN - ESTABLISHING - DAY
dialog: 
text: Having shaved and showered, wearing an old -but well-fitted-
text: gray suit, John pushes open the garage door...
dialog: 
dialog: ...to reveal a legend in dire need of a total overhaul: a
scene_heading: black, 1969 FORD MUSTANG `BOSS 429'.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A smile plays at his lips as John walks into the garage,
text: running a hand along the chassis, desperately in need of a
text: wash and wax. Behind him, the wall is lined with tools: a
text: mechanic's dream enclave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN ENTERS-
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOHN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -and closes the door behind him.
dialog: 
text: John takes a moment to breath it in: he loves this car...
dialog: although he hasn't taken very good care of it as of late. A
text: beat... and he slips the key into the ignition, twisting it,
text: the motor coughing to life, the exhaust pipe belching black
dialog: smoke.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE WICK HOME - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The vehicle pulls out of the garage, stalls briefly, come
text: back to life, puttering on down the road.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING - DAY
dialog: 
text: A soft rain begins to fall.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE HOSPITAL - A HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Carrying a humble bouquet of yellow daisies, John slowly
text: makes his way down the eerily empty corridor. He pauses
text: before a picture on the wall, glancing at his reflection upon
text: the glass. He takes a deep breath, exhales, and enters a
dialog: room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE HOSPITAL - A ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: John slowly approaches the figure lying in bed: surrounded by
text: machinery, accompanied by the soft sounds of technology.
dialog: 
text: He removes the wilted daisies from the vase, tosses them in
text: the trash, and replaces them with fresh ones.
dialog: 
text: He pulls over a chair, reaches out, and takes Norma's hand:
text: she is comatose, her breathing synthetic... so many
text: machines... so many wires, tubes, and monitors.
dialog: 
text: We never see her face: just her silhouette.
dialog: 
text: He holds her hand for a long moment in heavy silence.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Behind him, the DOCTOR -of a similar age to John- enters,
text: placing a hand on John's shoulder. John lowers his head, and
text: nods. With a bit of effort, he stands, staring down at her
text: for a long moment, never once releasing his grip, and leans
text: over to kiss her on the forehead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: ...it had to be you...
dialog: (a long beat, then)
dialog: ...be seein' ya'...
dialog: 
text: A beat... and John nods.
dialog: 
text: The doctor turns off the machine; lights dim, the room
text: settles into silence, and Norma's body grows still.
dialog: 
text: The Doctor leaves John to be alone with his wife.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Be seein' you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE BARN - DAY
dialog: 
text: John pulls into the building...
dialog: 
text: ...and sits behind the wheel for a long moment...
dialog: 
text: ...his eyes unblinking...
dialog: 
dialog: ...so very alone...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: John stands before the wall of pictures, statuesque as he
text: studies them... unmoving...
dialog: 
text: And then, he snaps; his hands gnarled into first, roaring
text: with rage as he punches the pictures, ripping them from the
text: wall, tossing them aside, eventually collapsing into a heap,
text: out of breath, his knuckles bleeding.
dialog: 
text: A long beat... and he chuckles softly, pulling himself to his
dialog: feet.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE BASEMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Unlike the rest of the house, this space is pristine and
dialog: organized: one half designated as an impressive wood shop,
text: the other an office space with a lazy boy recliner and tube
dialog: television.
dialog: 
text: John sits at his desk with a pencil in hand, a pad of paper
text: before him, thinking.
dialog: 
text: A long beat... and he sighs with a smile, placing the pencil
text: upon the pad before sliding them both aside.
dialog: 
text: John unscrews the cap off the bottle of scotch and pours
dialog: himself a healthy dose.
dialog: 
text: He opens his desk drawer, reaches into the back, and finds an
text: old pack of cigarettes, half-empty. He taps one from, places
text: it between his lips, and lights it, taking a deep pull. He
text: holds it, and exhales, his body relaxing.
dialog: 
text: He finishes his drink along with the cigarette, pours himself
dialog: another...
dialog: 
text: ...and then opens a BOTTLE OF PILLS (The label reading NORMA
text: WICK and OXYCONTIN), pouring them into a small mound upon the
text: desk. He stares at them for a long moment...
dialog: 
text: ...before selecting one, studying it, sighing and-
dialog: 
text: A KNOCK AT THE FRONT DOOR.
dialog: 
text: John freezes, not sure as to how best to proceed.
dialog: 
text: A beat... and someone KNOCKS a second time.
dialog: 
text: John sighs, drops the pill back onto the mound, and walks
dialog: upstairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE WICK HOME - DAY
dialog: 
text: A DELIVERY WOMAN waits for him on the doorstep. John opens
text: the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELIVERY WOMAN
dialog: John Wick?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
text: She hands him a clipboard and a pen.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELIVERY WOMAN
dialog: Sign here, please.
dialog: 
text: In a daze, John signs the clipboard and hands it back to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELIVERY WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And the pen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh. Sorry.
dialog: 
text: John hands her the pen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELIVERY WOMAN
dialog: Here you go!
dialog: 
text: The Delivery Woman hands him a card and a PLASTIC CASE by the
text: handle which he takes without looking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELIVERY WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Have a good day.
dialog: 
text: John nods, and -as she takes off- heads back inside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: John closing the door behind him...
dialog: 
text: ...and is startled by a small BARK.
dialog: 
text: A beat... and he looks down to find that he is actually
text: holding a small PET CARRIER. He lifts it to look inside:
text: the face of a young, tri-colored (black, white, and brown),
text: CHORGI (half-Corgi, half-Chihuahua) looks out at him, her
text: tail wagging fiercely.
dialog: 
text: She barks again, and John lowers it, confused.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Holding the envelope in his hands, John sits across from the
text: carrier which he has set upon the table. Inside, the Chorgi
text: lies with paws crossed, studying him, tilting her head from
dialog: side to side.
dialog: 
text: A beat... and John opens the letter. The card inside is
text: simple; white with a single DAISY drawn upon it. John smiles,
text: instantly knowing who it is from, running a thumb along the
text: face of the flower. He hesitates, but opens the card.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORMA (V.O.)
dialog: Dear, John. If you have received
dialog: this, then I have not survived the
dialog: surgery.
dialog: (a beat, then)
dialog: I am so, so sorry.
dialog: 
text: Tears begin to well in John's eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORMA (V.O.)
dialog: But you've still got a life ahead
dialog: of you, and I intend for you to
dialog: live it. You may think you've
dialog: hidden things from me, but you
dialog: haven't. I know you. And should
dialog: this reach you in time -which I
dialog: pray it has- I beg you, I implore
dialog: you, to stop. To think. To live.
dialog: (a beat, then)
dialog: I love you, John. With all my
dialog: heart. Our years were good. The
dialog: best, in fact. But I'd rather see
dialog: you later... than sooner... your
dialog: best friend... Norma.
dialog: 
text: John lowers the letter, wipes the tears from his cheeks, and
text: stares at the puppy... chuckling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well played, Norma.
dialog: 
text: John reaches across, and flicks open the pet carrier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (MUTTERS)
dialog: Well played.
dialog: 
text: The Chorgi scrambles out of the cage and studies him;
text: sniffing, licking, and barking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: So... you gotta' name?
dialog: 
text: John checks the collar to find a DAISY-SHAPED medallion which
speaker_heading: READS-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Moose.
dialog: (a beat, then)
dialog: Seriously?
dialog: 
text: As if in reply, Moose barks.

scene_heading: THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

scene_heading: THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.

text: out his legs, sitting on the edge of the bed, rubbing his
text: eyes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.
dialog: 
text: John glances over at MOOSE who lies on the bed, her paws

dialog: three.

speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (GROWLS)
dialog: I'm up, I'm up.

speaker_heading: BEGIN MONTAGE
dialog: 
text: - John fries up a couple of pieces of bacon and adds them to
text: his plate of scrambled eggs and toast.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He kneels down next to Moose's bowl and pours some of the
text: bacon grease over the kibble. As John takes his seat at the
text: table to enjoy his coffee, breakfast, and newspaper, Moose
text: devours her meal.
dialog: 
text: - With his car tilted up by jack stands, John lays upon a
text: creeper cart beneath it, changing the oil as -nearby- Moose
text: lies in the sun, fast asleep. The vehicle is pristine: fully
text: restored and lovingly detailed. Finishing up, John slides
text: out from beneath the vehicle, and wipes the grease from his
text: hands with a shop towel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: That oughta' do it.
speaker_heading: (TO MOOSE)
dialog: Wanna' try it out?
dialog: 
scene_heading: THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.
dialog: 
text: - At an abandoned airfield, the Mustang roars down the open
text: stretch of landing strip as Moose stands at the open window,
text: tongue wagging in the air. John is in his element: calm,
text: cool, and collected behind the wheel of his car... almost as
text: if it is a natural extension of himself. He deftly shifts
text: gears, reaching speeds in excess of 120 miles per hour before
text: hitting a long patch of gravel, shifting, spinning the wheel,
text: and skidding -while remaining in full control- as the wheels
text: skim over the earth. Moose barks. John smiles, reaching
text: over to scratch her on the back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Good girl, Moose. Good girl.
dialog: 
text: - At a small park, John sits at a picnic table, eating a
text: sandwich as he works his way through a small book of
text: crossword puzzles. A cup of hot coffee rests nearby as
text: beneath the table, Moose gnaws on a tough piece of rawhide.
dialog: 
text: -At a gas station, Moose barks at passing bikers as John
text: fills the tank.
dialog: 
text: IOSEF TARASOV -mid-twenties, thin, oiled hair, sunglasses,
text: hipster, douche-bag- parks his vintage BMW next to the Ford
text: and as he gasses up, motions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IOSEF
dialog: Nice ride.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IOSEF
dialog: How much?
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It ain't for sale, kid.
dialog: 
text: Iosef smirks with a shake of his head.

speaker_heading: IOSEF
dialog: (in Russian, subtitled)
dialog: Everything's got a fucking price.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (in Russian, subtitled)
dialog: Maybe so... but I don't.
dialog: 
text: Taken aback by John's fluency, he watches as John enters the
text: vehicle, guns the engine, and drives off.
dialog: 
text: - John dozes on the couch as -between his legs- Moose snores
text: softly.
dialog: 
text: - As John washes his car, Moose chases after birds before -
text: exhausted- laying upon her back in the sun, stretching as she
text: gnaws upon her favorite stuffed animal.
dialog: 
text: - With a glass of scotch resting on the end table beside him,
text: John sits in his weathered La-z-boy recliner with his reading
text: glasses on, a book before him, and Moose curled up, asleep in
text: his lap. A beat... and John closes his book, finishes his
speaker_heading: SCOTCH-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, then.
dialog: 
text: -and stands, with Moose leaping to the floor, leading the way
text: back upstairs.
dialog: 
text: - Moose lays on the foot of the bed, tail wagging. John
text: smiles, scratching her belly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Good night, Moose.

dialog: 
text: John awakes to hear Moose growling with tail thumping,
text: sitting before the closed door.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Do you need to go out?
dialog: 
text: John groans as he rolls out of bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (MUTTERS)
dialog: So could I, it would seem...
dialog: 
text: John opens the door. Moose barks, and sprints off into the

speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: What's gotten into y-
dialog: 
text: We hear a THUMP and a YELP.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -and freezes at the sight of two MASKED MEN...
dialog:

dialog: 
text: He suddenly sits up, remembering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: ...Moose...
dialog:

speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)

dialog:

dialog: 
text: ...and sees the trail of blood from where she was first
dialog: injured...
dialog: 
text: ...having pulled her broken body over to his side.
dialog: 
text: John lies down beside Moose, and softly... tenderly...
text: cradles her head in his hand, rubbing her cheek with his
dialog: thumb.
dialog: 
text: Moose relaxes, licks his thumb, sighs one last time...
dialog: 
text: ...and grows still.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: A beat...
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ...and John reaches down to retrieve Moose's stuffed animal

dialog: 
text: With a tender -careful- touch, John removes Moose's collar,

scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE BATHROOM - EARLY DAY
dialog: 
text: John takes a long, hot shower.
dialog: 
text: He sprays a bit of shaving foam into his hand, unfolds his

dialog: 
text: ...and begins to shave.
dialog: 
text: As he does so, the stress leaves his shoulders, his eyes

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY DAY
dialog: 
text: John gets dressed, but the outfit is slightly different than

scene_heading: INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - EARLY DAY

speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: What are you-
dialog: 
text: Without slowing, John reaches into the man's jacket, slips

dialog: 
text: THUMP! THUMP!
dialog: 
text: -fires -twice- into the man's heart, before turning-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUMP!
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -to enter the facility, shooting anything that moves. He is

dialog: 
text: The primarily Japanese crew is in a panic with most fleeing -
text: a number of whom are shot in the back- while those choosing
text: to shoot back are cut down in a blink.
dialog: 
text: Once emptied, John drops his pistol, kneels, sweeps up a

scene_heading: INT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -and slips behind the wheel. A slight smile plays upon his

speaker_heading: GAS-
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TAKESHI'S AUTOMOTIVE - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. A SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -turning to face the oncoming vehicles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. A SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

dialog: 
text: As the distance between them grows smaller, the passengers of

dialog: 
text: ...but before either of them can fire...
dialog: 
text: ...John fires off four shots, killing them each with a pair
dialog: of bullets...
dialog: 
text: ...before firing until empty...

dialog: 
text: As the two vehicles barrel towards one another...
dialog: 
dialog: ...John is stoic...
dialog: 
text: ...while the remaining driver is screaming.
dialog: 
text: At the last moment, the driver violently twists the steering
speaker_heading: WHEEL-
dialog: 
dialog: -barely avoiding the Mustang-
dialog: 
text: -but loses control of the vehicle, sending it toppling end

dialog: 
text: ...as a police chopper soars past overhead.
dialog: 
text: John doesn't look up as he quickly removes the front and rear

text: tosses them into the back seat, and-
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -slips behind the wheel. He twists, the key, revs the

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. A SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 
text: Eventually, John creates enough mayhem to tie up the police
dialog: on the ground-
dialog: 
text: -leaving the helicopter overhead.
dialog: 
text: On a long stretch of road, John reaches the vehicle's top

dialog: presses a button for-
dialog: 
scene_heading: -his NITROUS OXIDE SYSTEM-
dialog: 
text: -which causes the engine to SCREAM, roaring down the road at
dialog: an incredible speed-
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. THE RED CIRCLE - THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: With a cry derived far more from anger than pain, John head

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JIMMY NODS-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Enjoy.
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: It's been awhile, but... here's to
dialog: the past... may it influence our
dialog: future.
dialog: 
text: The music begins...
dialog: 
text: ...and Jenny sings IT HAD TO BE YOU.
dialog: 
text: Her rendition is powerful, sweet, endearing, passionate, and
text: sincere. As John watches her sing, a smile tugs at the corner
text: of his lips.
dialog: 
text: On the empty dance floor...
dialog: 
text: ...John watches a younger version of himself with Norma...
dialog: 
text: ...dancing slowly... twirling... her head on his shoulder...
dialog: 
dialog: ...smiling...
dialog: 
dialog: ...with a sigh...
dialog: 
dialog: ...before disappearing.
dialog: 
text: John swallows -hard- as a trembling hand wipes away a tear.
dialog: 
text: Jenny smiles at him with a nod.
dialog: 
text: He returns the gesture.
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
text: A beat... and he receives a text in return: "Yes. Where are
dialog: you?"
dialog: 
text: David texts back: "The Continental."
dialog: 
text: A beat... and he receives a text: "We may not engage in
dialog: hostilities upon those premises."
dialog:

dialog:

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
dialog: Empty.
dialog: 
text: A long beat... and two figures appear at one end of the hall
text: while three appear at the other end: suits, ties, gloves,
dialog: and masks.
dialog: 
text: One of them inserts a key card attached to his cell-phone and
text: hacks the lock; the light turning from red to green.
dialog: 
text: Another places a small, MAGNETIC GUN to the door, adjusts the
text: setting, and pulls the trigger-
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOHN'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -causing the latch to leap back from the door...
dialog: 
text: ...which opens.
dialog: 
text: All five men enter, closing the door behind them.
dialog: 
text: Sound asleep, John lays upon his back beneath the covers,
text: snoring softly.
dialog: 
text: Well-rehearsed, two men focus upon his legs while two focus
text: upon his arms, their hands hovering above an appendage as
text: they wait for the fifth (DAVID)...
dialog: 
text: ...who produces a plastic baggie, inside of which rests a
text: damp TOWEL.
dialog: 
text: David removes the towel...
dialog: 
text: ...counts down with a nod from 3... 2... 1...
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Like a well-oiled machine, hands clasp down upon John's arms
text: and legs as David slaps the rag down upon John's mouth.
dialog: 
text: John's body tenses as his eyes snap open...
dialog: 
text: ...but he does not inhale.
dialog: 
text: A beat... and John twists at an odd angle, causing one of the
text: men holding his arm to lose his grasp. With his one arm
text: free, John reaches up, grabs David's wrist, and snaps it.
dialog: 
text: As David stumbles backwards with a cry, the others pounce
dialog: upon John...
dialog: 
text: ...who produces the K-BAR blade from beneath the blankets,
text: driving it into the side of one man's neck once... twice...
dialog: three times...
dialog: 
text: ...before releasing the blade, arching his back, and wrapping
text: his legs around another man's neck, tensing until -SNAP- the
text: man's neck breaks.
dialog: 
text: The remaining three -horrified- are at a loss; far removed
dialog: from their element.
dialog: 
text: David and a gunman run for the door as a third steps back,
text: removes his silenced pistol from a shoulder holster, and
text: blindly fires.
dialog: 
text: The bullets etch up along the mattress and into the
dialog: headboard...
dialog: 
text: ...as John rolls off the bed, reaches beneath it, and grabs
dialog: the shotgun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOOM!
dialog: 
text: The gunman's left leg disappears as -screaming- he sinks to
dialog: the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOOM!
dialog: 
text: John fires again, hitting the fallen gunman in the chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOOM!
dialog: 
text: John fires at the fleeing gunman in the open doorway-
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -sending him spinning out into the hallway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOOM!
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He is shot a second time in the back, dead in a blink.
dialog: 
text: David rips off his mask as he slides to a stop, hands up,
text: just as John emerges from his room, pumping the shotgun for
dialog: affect.
dialog: 
text: A beat... and he walks towards David, the weapon steady.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: (TREMBLING)
dialog: ...please...
dialog: 
text: John places the shotgun to the back of David's head.
dialog: 
text: John is terribly -to an unsettling degree- calm.
dialog: 
text: He produces a small pill container, taps out two, and
text: swallows them as he rolls his injured shoulder with a groan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (TERRIBLY CALM)

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Just because I'm good at killin'...
dialog: doesn't mean I like it all that
dialog: much.
dialog: (a beat, then)
dialog: Give me something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wait, wait!
dialog: (swallowing hard, then)
dialog: Little Russia. There's a small
dialog: bank near Cannon Court...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What about it?
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Viggo owns it. It's where he keeps
dialog: his money. Every dollar of
text: business he does clears through
dialog: that building.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (a beat, then)
dialog: That'll do.
dialog: 
text: John swings the shotgun, knocking David out with the butt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLICK.
dialog: 
text: John freezes...
dialog: 
dialog: ...as HARRY -60s, African-American, former NFL receiver,
text: tall, lean, and imposing, yet currently dressed in boxers, a
text: t-shirt, and dress shoes- aims a pistol at the back of John's
text: head from the open doorway of his hotel room.

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: Catch and release.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Too long, I'd argue.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Why'd you take the job then?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS

dialog: your last.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: Much appreciated, then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (O.S.)
dialog: Open the door, goddammit!
dialog: 
text: Iosef drops his glass, and unlatches the door.
dialog: 
text: The Captain stumbles into the room, leaning heavy against his
text: desk, pausing to take a swig of whisky, blood trickling down
text: from his forehead, his left arm limp at his side.
dialog: 
text: The Captain reloads, reaches into his drawer, finds a snub-
text: nosed .38, and tosses it to Iosef.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know how to use that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IOSEF
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Good. Follow me. And if you shoot
dialog: me in the back, I'll be the one to
dialog: fuckin' kill you.
dialog: 
text: The Captain swings open the door, and -with his pistol in
dialog: both hands- enters-
dialog: 94.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE CHAYKA - A CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
dialog: -bodies lay everywhere.
dialog: 
text: Gunshots ring out.
dialog: 
text: A number of panicking crewmen flee the ship.
dialog: 
text: Iosef stays close to the Captain, his sweaty hands clinging
text: to the pistol. As the Captain rounds the corner-
dialog: 
scene_heading: -COMMOTION-
dialog: 
text: -as he and John collide.
dialog: 
text: SLOW MOTION...
dialog: 
text: ...as John looks past the Captain, his eyes locking onto
dialog: Iosef...
dialog: 
text: ...who -panicking- raises his pistol, and FIRES-
dialog: 
text: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: 
text: -hitting the Captain in the shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: You piece of shit, motherfucker!
dialog: 
text: Iosef turns and flees...
dialog: 
text: ...as the Captain and John disarm one another.
dialog: 
text: The Captain roars -in pain and anger- driving a fist into
text: John's side, breaking ribs. He follows through with a wild
text: left, but John avoids it, slapping it aside, the Captain's
text: forward momentum sending his fist to SHATTER again the iron
text: wall of his ship.
dialog: 
text: The Captain howls, wrapping his arms around John, crushing
dialog: him...
dialog: 
text: ...and as consciousness begins to fade...
dialog: 
text: ...John's teeth close around the captain's nose, cleaving it
text: from his face.
dialog: 
text: Stunned, the Captain releases John who kicks out his knee,
text: moves behind him, wraps his arms around the wounded man's
text: head, and SNAPS his neck.
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE CHAYKA - THE DECK - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Iosef emerges from the lower deck, firing back into the
text: darkness as tears roll down his face.
dialog: 
dialog: A beat...
dialog: 
text: ...and John emerges, the very visage of death: his chest
text: etched with bullet wounds, blood trickling down his face,
text: wet, dirty, wounded, pale, and yet...
dialog: 
dialog: ...unstoppable.
dialog: 
text: John moves at a steady pace, the gun in his hand at his side,
text: arm limp.
dialog: 
text: Iosef sprints towards the far end of the ship, and climbs up
text: the ladder towards the pilothouse.
dialog: 
text: John follows.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE CHAYKA - THE PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Overlooking the entire ship's deck, the pilothouse offers
text: little in the way of escape.
dialog: 
text: Instead, Iosef now finds himself trapped.
dialog: 
text: He searches the desk and finds a LETTER OPENER which he
text: yields like a knife, turning...
dialog: 
text: ...as John enters the room.
dialog: 
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IOSEF
dialog: Well, come on, muthafucka! LET'S
dialog: DANCE! YOU AND ME!
dialog: 
text: A beat... and John raises the pistol, and fires off his last
text: round, punching a hole in the glass.
dialog: 
text: Iosef grins, laughing as John drops his weapon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IOSEF (CONT'D)
dialog: You missed, bitch!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No. I didn't.
dialog: 
text: John surges into Iosef...
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ...whose hand comes down with the letter opener. John
text: catches his wrist, and snaps it as his right hand darts up,
text: constricts around Iosef's jaw, cracking it in two...
dialog: 
text: ...lifting him from with the ground...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (GROWLS)
dialog: For Moose.
dialog: 
text: ...and hurling him through the pane of glass which EXPLODES.
dialog: 
text: SCREAMING, Iosef tumbles end over end, his body slamming into
text: chute from which grain continues to pour, the hull close to
dialog: full.
dialog: 
text: Iosef cartwheels over it and lands half-in/half-out of the
text: hull, SNAPPING his back, as around him...
dialog: 
dialog: ...grain piles higher...
dialog: 
text: ...as he sinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IOSEF
dialog: NO! HELP ME! NO! N...
speaker_heading: (FADING)
dialog: 
text: While his legs remain on deck, his upper torso sinks
text: slightly, the grain covering his face, muting his screams...
dialog: 
text: ...as he suffocates to death.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE CHAYKA - THE PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: John stares down at him for a long moment, turns...
dialog: 
text: ...and leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. A CITY STREET - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Silence as a soft snow begins to fall.
dialog: 
dialog: A beat...
dialog: 
text: ...and a sedan rounds the corner, takes it too wide, and
dialog: crashes.
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A SEDAN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Perched behind the wheel with his head down, John groans,
text: leaning back as snow wafts through the door's broken side
dialog: window.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. A STREET - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: John pulls himself out of the vehicle, stumbles a few feet,
speaker_heading: ENTERS-
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AN ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -leans heavy against the wall, and slides into a sitting
dialog: position.
dialog: 
text: John Wick looks to be on death's very doorstep....
dialog: 
dialog: ...however...
dialog: 
dialog: ...death will not take him.
dialog: 
text: With an almost frustrated/irritated groan John pulls himself
text: to his feet, and staggers down the alley.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Small, simple, and clean.
dialog: 
text: A beat... and an elbow is driven through the door's window.
text: John reaches in, unlocks the door, opens it, enters, and
text: closes it behind him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - A SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: John grabs an empty box and begins filling it with
text: instruments, medication, bandages, and the like.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - THE BACK ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: John enters to find an empty room...
dialog: 
dialog: ...save a single YOUNG DOG -a mutt of no distinguishable
text: breed, three years old- who sits staring at him, offering
text: little more than a tilt of its head.
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: John strips and -using the hose attachment- rinses his body
text: clean: the damage is extensive with cuts, bruises, and three
text: bullet holes (one in his shoulder, one his side, and one in
text: his chest).
dialog: 
text: John studies the bullet wounds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: (MUTTERS)
dialog: Through and through... through and
dialog: through...
dialog: 
text: However when he gets to the one in his chest-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
text: Buried deep.
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: 
text: John swallows a handful of pills, clenches his teeth, and -
text: using a pair of needle nose pliers- reaches into the wound,
dialog: searching...
dialog: 
text: ...until he finds the bullet which he pulls free.
dialog: 
text: John cleans the wounds with disinfectant, applies a number of
text: pads/bandages, and studies himself in the mirror: he is a
text: complete and total wreck... but alive.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - THE SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Searching, John finds some surgical garb; thin pants and a
text: shirt which he slips into.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE - THE BACK ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: John takes a jacket off of the rack, tries it on -too small-
text: moves on to the second one, and it fits. John flicks off the
text: light, and leaves the room. A long beat...
dialog: 
text: ...and John returns, turning the light back on. From across
text: the room, he stares at the young dog, studying it.
dialog: 
text: The dog makes no sound, tilting it's head from side to side.
dialog: 
text: A beat... and John walks to the cage, removing the clipboard
text: from its side, reading it: we can see that the dog is
dialog: scheduled to be put down tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Miko, huh?
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Miko replies with a tilt of her head-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: That's quite the name.
dialog: 
text: -and a paw pressed to the side of the cage.
dialog: 
text: John smiles, places the clipboard on top of the cage, and
text: opens its door.
dialog: 
text: Miko doesn't move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you coming or not?
dialog: 
text: A beat... and Miko leaps down onto the floor, tail wagging.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: That's what I thought.
dialog: 
text: John takes a leash off of the wall, and clips it to Miko's
dialog: collar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on. Let's go home.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AN ALLEY - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. THE CONTINENTAL - THE SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: As he approaches the door, he searches his pocket for a gold

dialog: long beat...
dialog: 
text: ...and down below, it clatters out into a small receptacle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINSTON (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Perkins...
dialog:
