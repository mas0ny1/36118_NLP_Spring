speaker_heading: PATRICK (V. 0 . )
dialog: To people who grow up here, this city is
dialog: like family. The thing about family,
dialog: about the city, about the church, about
dialog: the people you grow up with-- is that no
dialog: matter how much they hurt you, no matter
dialog: what the cost is, you still love them.
dialog: And despite all our flaws-- what we do to
dialog: each other-- what is done to us-- I've
dialog: always felt proprietary about it all.
dialog: Like the old commercial for dog food:
dialog: 'doesn't your dog deserve to be treated
dialog: like a member of the family?' I've always
dialog: believed it depended on the dog. Beyond
dialog: that, the most I thought about anything
dialog: was what I wanted to do. Who I wanted to
dialog: be. To rise where my father said I
dialog: couldn't go, to succeed. To be a man.

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What do you know about him?
speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: DOYLE

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: In May I came up to check on Amanda. She

dialog: story when Helene and Ray came home. They
dialog: didn't know I was there and they started
dialog: talking about how they had robbed this

dialog: leaving the state. I called Remy and told
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Then what?
text: Lionel pours another shot down his throat, gathers himself.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Then we took her.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Remy laid out this plan, it seemed easy.
dialog: We take her, force Helene and Ray to
dialog: cough up the money, and then put her
dialog: back. You know? Amanda gets a weekend in
dialog: the country; My sister learns a lesson;
dialog: And fuck it, we'll all get paid on top of
dialog: it . . . I got no problem taking money from
dialog: a guy like Cheese.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: They were gonna handle the cops, but Bea
dialog: went nuts calling the papers and hired
dialog: you. Once you found the money they had
dialog: Amanda and the money. So they decided to
dialog: set up a fake exchange for you to
dialog: witness. They got Chris Mullen to set
text: Cheese up at the quarry for 15k and a
dialog: chance to be the boss. Even though it was
dialog: too late, Cheese figured out what was
dialog: happening and started shooting. You have
dialog: to understand, I never been around that.

speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: When I got over there I found my niece in

dialog: 
dialog: Long exhale.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)

text: The Bartender is standing there with a smoking gun, in shock.
text: Patrick leaps out of his chair and drives his head into
text: Bressant's stomach. Wrapping his arms around his waist, he
text: plows his spine straight back into the bar.
dialog: 
text: Bressant cracks the shotgun stock down onto the back of
text: Patrick's neck, buckling his knees and crashing him to the

text: Patrick gets to his feet and looks around. Angie is okay.
text: Patrick turns and RACES out the front door after Bressant.

scene_heading: EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Patrick looks up and down the street, but Bressant is nowhere
text: to be seen. He sees a BLOODY POPEYE MASK on the ground. A
text: TRAIL OF BLOOD runs away from it which Patrick follows across
dialog: the street.
text: The thickening trail leads Patrick along the side of a LARGE
text: 3-STORY FACTORY (in the process of being converted to lofts)
text: and to a DOOR near the back. Blood is smeared on the door and
text: a small red puddle has formed on the ground.
scene_heading: INT FACTORY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
text: Leading with his gun, Patrick steps into a bright STAIRWELL.
text: Blood tracks up the stairs and Patrick ascends cautiously.
text: He climbs one flight.
text: And then another -- pausing on the landing. Above him, light
text: comes through an OPEN DOOR. He starts for it.
text: Patrick continues up the last few steps. He reaches the top
dialog: and peers out onto:
scene_heading: EXT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
text: Patrick scans the roof for Remy. He sees nothing on his right
text: and turns around to his left, circling the stairwell. Behind
text: him we see a magnificent view of the neighborhood. He turns
dialog: another corner to see:
dialog: 
text: Bressant sits against an aluminum vent - - his head leaned
text: back and his eyes half closed. A ROSE OF BLOOD spreads out
text: against Bressant's shirt. His flesh is beginning to grey.
dialog: 
text: Patrick holds his gun on him and calls out.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Put the fuckin' gun down! Put it down.
dialog: 
text: Remy has his gun on his lap. He lets it fall to his side.
speaker_heading: BRESSANT

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Fuck you. You let this little girl die.

speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT' D)
dialog: 'Do your best.' Fuck you, this is my

text: Bressant wags his head a little
speaker_heading: BRESSANT

text: Patrick looks at him.
speaker_heading: BRESSANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me see the city.
dialog: 
text: Patrick stands there. Bressant looks out at Boston, rising
text: steel and glass in the setting August sun. Autumn is almost
text: at hand and the crispness of the air makes the view all the
dialog: more sad.
text: Bressant makes a guttural sound, appreciating the last thing
dialog: he'll see.
text: Patrick looks at him, dying. Not how he expected this to end.
dialog:

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: So, after setting up Jean Baptiste, your

dialog: killed? And you didn't have nothing to

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: He was probably killed by Sgt. Detective
dialog: Remy Bressant or anyone else who wanted

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: He's not my friend.
speaker_heading: BEEFY OFFICER
dialog: You charge money as a detective. But you
dialog: were at the quarry and yet you had no
dialog: idea it was a set up?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I trust the Police when they tell me
dialog: something. And I had a fake ransom note
dialog: and Amanda's blanket the cops left in my
dialog: mailbox. And I heard the tape from when
dialog: Cheese, or I guess it was Chris
dialog: pretending to be Cheese, called the
dialog: station.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: A 911 call?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: No. The call into the station from Cheese

scene_heading: EXT MASS TURNPIKE - DAY
text: The car speeds along the empty highway, carving through thick

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: He was a part of it. They don't tape

speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: Why? For a third of a hundred and thirty
dialog: grand? What for?
dialog: 
text: He just looks at her.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Had to be for something.

speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: He's better for her.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Why? Because he has money and makes

speaker_heading: ANGIE
speaker_heading: SIMPLY)

speaker_heading: PATRICK

speaker_heading: ANGIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

scene_heading: EXT. DOYLE SUMMER COTTAGE, DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: We push in, approaching Doyle who turns to see Patrick.
text: Doyle watches Patrick. He offers a measured greeting.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Patrick Kenzie. To what do I owe the
dialog: pleasure?
dialog: 
text: He holds Doyle's look.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Remy Bressant died last night.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I was told. It's a shame.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Hard to understand. He seemed like a
dialog: good man.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: He was a good man. You don't know why
dialog: people do what they do. Only they see
text: out their own windows.
text: With that, AMANDA walks out the door, running to Jack and
text: clinging to his leg. Jack holds Patrick's look.
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Papapa. Come make sandwiches now please.
dialog: 
text: Doyle smiles, giving away nothing of his tension with
dialog: Patrick.
text: Francine comes to the door.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
speaker_heading: (TO FRANCINE)
dialog: It's all right.
speaker_heading: (TO AMANDA)
dialog: Go inside, my sweet. I'll be there soon
dialog: and make you a sandwich.
text: Francine hesitates. Doyle is gentle.
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm all right.
text: Francine takes her back inside.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Doyle smiles.
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: So you know. Good for you. You
dialog: uncovered the thing men died for.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Men killed for.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I'm giving that little girl a life.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: It's not your life to give. Helene is
dialog: her mother. You think she's a bad mother
dialog: you should have gone to social services.
dialog: Short of that, it's her mother, it's
dialog: where she belongs.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Turn around, get back in your car and
dialog: wait thirty years. You don't know what
dialog: the world is made of yet.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I know I'm tired of being lied to and
text: tired of being lectured by a gang of
dialog: criminals. I'm calling the State Police
dialog: in five minutes. They'll be here in ten.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You haven't made that call because you
dialog: think it might be an irreparable mistake.
dialog: Because part of you believes it doesn't
dialog: matter what the rules say. Because you
dialog: know, when the lights go out and it's
dialog: just you and your conscience you ask
dialog: yourself if she's better here or better
dialog: there, you know the answer and you always
dialog: will.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: See you at the arraignment.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You can do one good pure thing here
dialog: today. One right thing. Most men don't
dialog: get that chance in a lifetime.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You walk away from that, you may not
dialog: regret it when you get home, or in a year
dialog: but I promise you, get to where I am, you
dialog: will. But I'll be dead by then, you'll
dialog: be old, and she'll be trailing a ragged,
dialog: tattered childhood of her own -- and
dialog: you'll be the one who has to tell them
dialog: you' re sorry.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Then I guess I will. I'll tell them I'm
dialog: sorry and I'll live with it. And maybe
dialog: that will happen, what I'm not gonna do,
dialog: is have to apologize to a grown woman who
dialog: says, why did you leave me? I got
dialog: kidnapped, my aunt hired you to find me,
dialog: and you did. You found me with a strange
dialog: family but you broke your promise and you
dialog: left me there. Why? Why didn't you
dialog: bring me home?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT' D)
dialog: It don't matter how many outfits and
dialog: snacks and family trips we took-- they
dialog: weren't my family, they stole me and I
dialog: was raised as a stranger to myself and
dialog: the life I would have had. You knew
dialog: about it, you knew better and you did
dialog: nothing. And maybe that grown woman will
dialog: forgive me but I won't forgive myself.
dialog: 
dialog: Silence . . .
text: It hangs in the air.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: The only thing I care about is that
dialog: little girl. And I'm gonna bring her
dialog: home.
text: Doyle hears this. Has his reaction, something like a
text: sagging, an emptiness, and a resolution.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
speaker_heading: I STILL
dialog: Then you'll have to excuse me.
dialog: have a sandwich left to make.
dialog: 
text: He turns and walks inside.
speaker_heading: SAME - LATER
text: Patrick watches from down the road. Doyle is on the porch.
text: Jack sits in his favorite chair. Amanda is on his lap,
text: facing him, arms around his shoulders, head tucked into his
text: neck. He slowly rocks the chair. He holds Amanda like its
text: the last hug of his life. His eyes are fixed on a point
text: somewhere far off in the distance.
dialog: 
text: Patrick takes out his phone.
dialog: 
text: In the distance sirens wail faintly, getting louder.
text: Just inside the door is Amanda's colorful kids back-pack, a
text: strange and cute stuffed snake, and Francine's bag spilling
text: over with zip-locked snacks and children's cups-- all the
dialog: stuff Francine had packed to make sure Amanda would have,
dialog: whereever she'd go.
text: Over this all, beginning faintly and growing increasingly
text: audible, is the inanity of the television news. It's blather
text: like a merciless blanket of idiocy over something hopelessly
dialog: sad.
text: A swarm of West Beckett POLICE CRUISERS cram the small road.
text: A Deputy knocks on the door. Doyle answers. He knows the
text: local cops' who are embarrassed to arrest him. He makes it
dialog: easy for them.
text: Doyle nods at the deputy with quiet acceptance and the
dialog: dignity of a man at peace with the choices h e r s made.
text: The DEPUTY puts a hand-cuffed Doyle into the back of his car.
dialog: 
dialog: Francine Doyle silently mouthing! "oh my God' oh my God."
text: Angie looks out from the car' past the policef past
dialog: everything.
text: They move to Francine to put her in a police car.
text: Amandal being taken from Francine' cries and reaches out to
text: her. She screams.
text: Francine is handcuffed.

text: Patrick stands with a GROUP OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES.

dialog: I did everything I wanted to do. I proved
dialog: my father wrong. I either learned my
dialog: lesson or became a man, I can't tell the
dialog: difference . Either way, all it' s left me
dialog: is the hollow, copper aftertaste in my
text: throat, like a vague and distant regret.
dialog: Remy was right, I know very little--but
dialog: what I do know, I am sure of: I was wrong
dialog: about that commercial. "Shouldn' t your
dialog: dog be treated like a member of the
dialog: family?" It doesn't depend on the dog. It
