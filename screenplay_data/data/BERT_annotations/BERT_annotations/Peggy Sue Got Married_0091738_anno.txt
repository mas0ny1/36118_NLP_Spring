speaker_heading: PEGGY

scene_heading: EXT. KELCHER HOUSE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Pretty strange.
text: Peggy hesitates, unsure how to handle her accumulated

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on. Get in. I can take care of

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Not now, Charlie. I've got a
dialog: headache. Get used to the word.
dialog: Roll it around your tongue for a

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know. About what we said on
dialog: Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Refresh my memory.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How could you forget? We talk about
dialog: seeing other people and you forget?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Maybe I blocked it out.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I can understand that.. But please

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT
text: Charlie's car pulls up.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

text: I can see it the music pans out.
dialog: (more tentative)
dialog: And right after graduation we
dialog: should start seeing other people.
dialog: Kind of comparison shop before we

dialog: what I mean?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Why wait?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Well, we got the prom coming up,

text: Charlie opens the locker. Peggy watches carefully, memorizing

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Want me to drive you home later?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Would you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (growling)
dialog: Would I?!! Why I oughta...
text: Unaccountably, this cracks Charlie up. He walks away

scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING

speaker_heading: GILFOND
dialog: ...What Hemingway's saying,
dialog: Michael, is that we are alone 

speaker_heading: GILFOND

speaker_heading: PEGGY

dialog: prepared?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: All.... Okay. Sure.
text: Peggy walks to the front and faces the class, smiling primly.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Choosing a good nursery school can
dialog: be one of the most important
dialog: decisions you can make. It will
dialog: often determine your child's
dialog: attitude towards education and
dialog: schooling.
dialog: (proud of herself)
dialog: Of course, the lessons learned are
dialog: primarily social  sharing, being
dialog: considerate of others.
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: And they're so cute when they're
dialog: little. They bring you back their
dialog: Little masterpieces every day and
dialog: you put 'em on the refrigerator
dialog: door. They're so proud, and their

scene_heading: CLOSE - A BATON	TWIRLING IN THE AIR

scene_heading: EXT. PLAYING FIELD  LATER

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Looking good out there.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I noticed you were giving me the
dialog: silent treatment at lunch. I guess
dialog: I deserved it. I've been thinking
dialog: about my three year plan and I
dialog: think it's unworkable. I must have
dialog: been delirious.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I thought it had a lot of merit.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: In the abstract maybe. Get a grip
dialog: on yourself! But when I imagine you

speaker_heading: PEGGY
text: Rejected, worthless, miserable.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: RICHARD

dialog: talk about?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I want to ask you a question.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you think...time travel is
dialog: possible?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Are you doing some kind of science
dialog: project?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Sort of.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well... in a Newtonian framework,
dialog: the possibilities were limited, but
dialog: with the advent of relativity
dialog: theory, the idea of absolute time
dialog: can no longer be reasonably
dialog: affirmed.
text: Peggy hasn't understood a word.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: And then, there's Richard's
dialog: Burrito.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That's my own theory based on a
dialog: Mexican food called the burrito.
dialog: I had it once when my parents took
dialog: me to Disneyland.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I	know what a burrito is.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well, I think time is like a
dialog: burrito. Sometimes it just folds
text: over on itself and one part touches
dialog: the other.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: What's inside?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You can till it with whatever you
dialog: want. From illusions to memory,
dialog: from experience to innocence, from
dialog: happiness to the entire universes
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: So you think time travel is
dialog: possible? For people?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Absolutely. People, dogs,
dialog: elephants.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Listen, you've gotta keep this a
dialog: secret. You can't tell a soul.
dialog: Promise?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay. I promise.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: This is serious. Nobody can know.
dialog: Ah, I've returned from the future.
dialog: I traveled back here 25 years.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You probably are crazy. Wait a
dialog: minute. Is this some kind of joke?
dialog: I know what you all, think of me.
speaker_heading: PEGGY.
dialog: No. Really. You're the smartest
dialog: person I know. It sounds
dialog: unbelievable. But I can prove it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You have a blind grandfather. One

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: How, did you know about my

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Because I'm telling you the truth.
dialog: I know what's going to happen.

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Confucious says, The way out is

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Step in front of the truck! If

dialog: impossible.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: What if it's beyond science? What
dialog: it it's God?
speaker_heading: RI CHARD
dialog: Einstein said "God doesn't play
dialog: dice with the universe." I'm a
dialog: scientist. I believe that there's
dialog: an order to things. Why would God
dialog: bring you back as a high school
dialog: girl?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You're a molecule in chaos, a
dialog: discontinuent aberration. Maybe
dialog: you've just got powers of
dialog: precognition. Well, maybe you're
text: just out of whack.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I told you, I've already lived my

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: NANCY
text: She's almost a juvenile delinquent.
text: Mr. Kelcher gives Nancy a look and points to the door.
text: Without her father noticing, Nancy creeps up behind him and
text: makes rabbit ears behind his head. Charlie tries hard not to
text: laugh. Nancy continues to clown.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, sir. But that's what I like
dialog: about her. She's not like all the
text: other girls at school.
scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: Charles, in spite of your
dialog: adolescent infatuation with music,
dialog: we've always regarded you a a fine
dialog: young man. We've trusted you with
dialog: our daughter.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway
dialog: street. In the past two years I've
dialog: been pleased to note that you and
dialog: Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled
dialog: your sacred trust of being good
dialog: parents to the, uh, woman I plan to
dialog: take off your hands.
text: Mr. Kelcher looks as if he's witnessing the latest attack of
dialog: teenage weirdness.
scene_heading: INT. PEGGY'S BEDROOM
text: Peggy is changing a record. She sees the dress she was
text: wearing the day before (and at the reunion) slung across a
text: chair. As Peggy picks it up, a book of matches falls out.
text: Peggy picks it up, excited.
scene_heading: INSERT: MATCHBOOK which reads: FINISH HIGH SCHOOL IN YOUR
text: SPARE TIME. Peggy frantically searches the dress pockets and
text: slowly draws out two joints. She stares at them for a beat.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: (worrying)
dialog: Oh, Beth.
text: There's a knock at the door. Peggy quickly hides the joints.
text: Mrs. Kelcher opens the door.
scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER
dialog: Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't
dialog: you ready?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: For what?
scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER
text: Maddy's party.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I don't feel very festive.
scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER
dialog: You accepted an invitation, Maddy's
dialog: one of your best friends, and I
dialog: baked the Rice Krispie squares.
text: Peggy laughs.
scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER
dialog: Enjoy yourself! This is the best
dialog: time of your life. And the sooner
dialog: you learn to handle Charlie the
dialog: better. Get dressed.
text: Mrs. Kelcher closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: We think this party might cheer
dialog: her up. Just make sure you know
dialog: what's expected of you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What would that be, sir?
scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: Show her a good time, but for God's
dialog: sake restrain yourself.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Of course.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON PEGGY
text: walking downstairs, surprised by Charlie and Dad talking.
scene_heading: EXT. KELCHER HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Peggy and Charlie exit and walk towards his car. Peggy's
text: holding a pan of Rice Krispie squares. Charlie slips Peggy's
text: sweater back on her shoulder. He's trying hard to make up.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Where did you get that sweater?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Great, isn't it?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: It's really Fifties. You sort of
dialog: clash with the world.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey! What's the fun of being a
dialog: teenager if you can't dress weird?
dialog: And we're going to have fun
dialog: tonight, right?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Right. I promised my mother.
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S CAR  NIGHT - DRIVING
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Is this slow enough for you?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: (serious)
dialog: Charlie, how are you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are
dialog: you? Are we talking on the phone?
dialog: Are we pen pals?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Seriously. What's it like to be
dialog: eighteen?
text: Charlie looks thoughtful, then guns the engine.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's great. I cleaned the car, do
dialog: you like it? Oh, I got tickets for
dialog: Fabian on your birthday, you like
dialog: him, right? He's cool. Eighteen is
dialog: half of thirty six. It's "Gentlemen
dialog: start your engines", vroom, like
dialog: I'm gassed up ready for the race.
dialog: I've got the girl, I've got the
dialog: car, I've got the talent, but I
dialog: don't know. Do I date, get married,
dialog: join the army, cut a record, go to
dialog: college? I got a million choices,
dialog: but nobody teaches you how to
dialog: choose. But it's different for a
dialog: girl. You're Lucky. You just have
dialog: to wait for me.
scene_heading: INT. MADDY'S HOUSE  BASEMENT
text: Thirty kids are dancing, talking, snacking. One couple makes

speaker_heading: DOUG

scene_heading: INT. MADDY'S HOUSE  HALLWAY TO BASEMENT

scene_heading: INT. MADDY'S HOUSE  BASEMENT

speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Goes down, smooth. Hey, look what
text: the cat dragged in.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Have no fear. Charlie's here.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh, it's you is it.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Jumping Jehosophat!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It's a miracle!
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Hi, guys.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Now that's a purty little heifer.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why Pete's the best darn cook on
dialog: the Panhandle!
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Why I oughta!
text: The boys all crack up.
scene_heading: THE PARTY  LATER
text: Walter, Leon, Charlie and Terry crowd around Arthur who has
text: an open, widemouthed bottle of beer in his hand.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ready. Set. Go -
text: Arthur rapidly chugalugs the entire beer and immediately
text: recites from memory as the boys urge him on:
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (going: for speed)
text: HiYo Silver! A cloud of dust, a
text: galloping horse with the speed of
dialog: light, a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The
dialog: Lone Ranger! With his faithful
dialog: Indian companion Tonto, the daring
dialog: and resourceful Masked Rider of the
dialog: Plains came to Earth with powers-
dialog: and abilities far beyond those of
dialog: mortal men.
dialog: Return with us now to those
dialog: thrilling days of yesteryear - from
dialog: out of the...
text: Arthur lets out a huge belch. Everybody cracks up.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: You doorknob! You threw in
dialog: Superman!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Too bad. Close to a record.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (foaming at the nose)
dialog: I hate it when the beer comes out
dialog: my nose.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER AREA
text: Peggy, Carol and Maddy bemusedly watching the boys.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Can you believe I want to marry
dialog: that dork.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Why do guys do such stupid things?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You know, I never could figure that
dialog: one out.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Maddy, Arthur, Walter, Carol, Charlie and Peggy sit on a
text: couch. Maddy and Carol sit in their boyfriends' laps. Peggy
text: sits distractedly on the couch arm. They cross talk  boys to
dialog: boys  girls to girls.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: I was thinking of four ushers and
text: four bridesmaids.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The Yanks got the hitting but the
dialog: Sox got the defense.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What are your colors, going to be?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I'l1 take Kubek and Richardson
text: over Fox and Aparicio.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: I'm thinking of pink and green.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Dolores and Terry standing in a corner kissing passionately.
speaker_heading: MADDY (CONT'D.)
dialog: Look at Dolores. What a tramp.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Pitching wins pennants. The Tigers
dialog: got four potential twenty game
dialog: winners.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You'd be surprised at how many
dialog: girls in school aren't virgins.
scene_heading: WALTER AND ARTHUR
dialog: (to Carol)
dialog: Like who?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don Mossi, Frank Lary, Jim Sunning
dialog: and Paul Foytack.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT  LATER
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: And now, direct from three weeks of
text: rehearsal in Walter's garage, four
dialog: guys who have dedicated their lives
dialog: to becoming the greatest singing
dialog: group in the world... (beat)
text: Charlie, Walter, Leon and Terry.
dialog: The Definitions.
text: Applause as the group enters from the furnace room. They all
text: wear black pants and iridescent sharkskin jackets. Charlie is
text: in the center of the group as they position themselves.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: One, two, three-...
text: The group begins to SING an A CAPELLA version of RAMA LAMA
text: DING DONG (or I WONDER WHY). Charlie sings lead, backed up by
text: the other three. Walter dances insane, Temptationlike steps.
text: The crowd huddles around them, clapping and grooving. Peggy
text: is on the planet of lost innocence, removed and melancholy.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Charlie really has a great voice.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Maybe they'll be the next Dion and
dialog: the Belmonts.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Don't get your hopes up.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
text: Charlie SINGS directly to Peggy, grinning at her. In spite of
text: herself, she smiles back at him. She's starting to realize
dialog: why she fell in love with him. He's irresistible.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: He is kind of cute, isn't he?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yeah. You're so lucky. He really
dialog: loves you, too. He's always telling
dialog: Walter how wonderful you are.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: He does?
text: The group finishes the song. Charlie blows Peggy a kiss. The
text: crowd APPLAUDS, including Peggy. Dolores joins Peggy, Carol
dialog: and Maddy.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Carol and I saw you with that
dialog: creep, Richard, today.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: First of all, Richard is not a
dialog: creep. He happens to be an
dialog: exceptional person. If any of you
dialog: gave him half a chance, you'd find
dialog: that out.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: God, Peggy, you're so unformed
dialog: you're practically fetal. You're
dialog: just taking pity on him 'cause he
dialog: has no friends.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Dolores, can't you be a little
dialog: kinder to people? You don't even
dialog: know the boy. If you weren't so
dialog: neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd
dialog: shut up for a while and show some
dialog: compassion.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Are you for real?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Touchy, touchy!
text: Dolores storms away.
speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: (to Peggy)
dialog: I don't know what you said to her,
dialog: but I wish I'd said it.
text: Charlie and Walter walk over and accept "BRAVOS" from the
text: girls. Walter does his James Dean imitation.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Charlie, what do you think of
dialog: Richard Norvik?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Is he gonna help you with that
dialog: physics stuff?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
text: He's trying.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey! Who needs physics when
dialog: we've got chemistry?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: (charmed)
dialog: Come on, let's dance.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: Put on some makeout music, and
dialog: kill the lights.
text: We HEAR a RECORD SCRATCH. A slow song begins. The lights are
text: dimmed. Coupler begin to slow dance. Charlie holds Peggy
text: close, barely moving. Peggy is mistyeyed, moved by being in
text: Charlie's arms again.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: There isn't a girl in school that
dialog: can hold a candle to you..
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You're pretty charming when you
dialog: want to be.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah I know. But I don't have to
dialog: flatter you. It just feels right.
dialog: You're the perfect girl for me. As
dialog: in is, was and always will be. I'm
dialog: glad dancing was invented. You
dialog: know the first dances were rituals.
dialog: Like fertility rites.
text: As they dance Charlie gets embarrassed by an erection, and
text: moves his hips away from Peggy. She surprises him by
text: grabbing his tush and pulling him into her.
scene_heading: INT. MADDY'S BASEMENT - LATER
text: MUSIC FADES INTO the song "PARTY DOLL" by Buddy Knox.
text: Peggy is doing the Twist, showing Charlie and several others.
text: Walter gets the hang of it, twisting on one leg. Carol tries
text: to keep up. Maddy and Arthur are always a beat behind.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: Hey Terry, what is that? Did Peggy
dialog: make it up? I've never seen that
text: on Bandstand.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What if we're witnessing the end of
dialog: touch dancing?
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S CAR - DESERTED LANE - NIGHT
text: The windows are fogged. Peggy and Charlie kiss tenderly.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Mmm. This is nice. I always loved
dialog: the way you kiss. I missed you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Your eyes look like silver pools of
text: moonlight. And the tide rushes in.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You really love me, don't you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know I do. I even wrote you
dialog: into my will.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: Charlie, let's make love.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?
dialog: (nonbelieving)
dialog: You want to have intercourse! Last
dialog: weekend you said... What time is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: A lot's happened since last
dialog: weekend.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But you're the one who wanted to
dialog: wait till we got married. And you
dialog: were right. We should wait.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: (f1ustered)
dialog: I probably meant it when I said it.
dialog: (beat; coyly)
dialog: Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Who?
text: Peggy starts to GIGGLE, realizing the absurdity of the
text: situation. The more she GIGGLES, the more agitated Charlie
text: gets. Peggy starts to unbutton Charlie's shirt.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You know. Your love machine... the
dialog: throbbing thrill hammer... your
dialog: thing!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You mean my wang? Listen, it's
dialog: running real late.
text: Charlie pushes her away, angry..
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What is this? What the hell is
dialog: going on? One week you say, "If you
dialog: love me you won't", now you say "If
dialog: you love me you will".
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Excuse me. That's a guy's line!
text: Peggy realizes she's blown it. Charlie isn't ready for this.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: This is a mistake. We better
dialog: forget it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy!
dialog: You sure know how to spoil a mood.
text: Charlie straightens himself up, starts the car and burns out.
scene_heading: EXT. KELCHER HOUSE  NIGHT
text: Charlie drops her off.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I'm sorry Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Save it.
text: Peggy watches him go. Looking at her darkened house, she
text: turns and walks down the street.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET  SHOWER'S CAFE
text: Peggy peeks in the window. The kids from the party are eating
text: and laughing. Rosalie Testa is dancing. Shaken by Rosalie,
text: she turns away. In the distance she SEES the lights of:
scene_heading: ART'S DONUT HOLE. OPEN 24 HOURS.
scene_heading: INT. ART'S DONUT HOLE
text: A few people linger over coffee. The waitress serving them is
text: Monica (the same but younger woman from LOVIN' OVEN).
text: In a corner, Michael Fitzsimmons, in a red leather jacket,
text: sits alone, reading. He looks up to check on his motorcycle
text: parked outside. He's splendid in his isolation.
text: Peggy enters, taking a seat at the counter, startled to see
text: Monica, who doesn't know her.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What would you like?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Monica? Aren't you Monica Hines?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yes. Who are you?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Ah... never mind. Can I have a
dialog: coffee, please? And a cinnamon
dialog: cruller.
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: How's Bobo?
text: Peggy notices Michael staring at her. Peggy smiles, Michael
text: doesn't. Monica brings Peggy her coffee and donut.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Twenty cents, please.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You're kidding?
text: Picking up her donut and coffee, she walks over to Michael's
text: table and sits opposite him.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I was impressed with what you said
dialog: in English class today.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Gilfond's okay, except he thinks
dialog: Hemingway's great Literature.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You don't?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (contemptuously)
dialog: He's a fisherman! The most
dialog: overrated writer of the century. I
dialog: mean, he's the perfect American
dialog: author  fat, violent, drunk...
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Maybe you're confusing his life
dialog: with his work.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: A writer's life is his work. Jack
dialog: Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull
dialog: to have something to write about.
text: He's out there feeling, burning...
dialog: grooving on life!
text: Michael leans back in his chair. He's said his piece. Peggy
text: studies him for a beat.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
text: The young man leaned back in his
dialog: chair. No bulls would die today.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What're you doing here anyway?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
text: Coffee and a donut.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I thought chicks like you traveled
dialog: in packs.
speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: DOLORES

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What, why?
scene_heading: EXT. ART'S DONUT HOLE  DOLORES'S POV:
text: Peggy and Michael leave the donut shop, get on Michael's
dialog: motorcycle.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
dialog: There's Peggy with Michael
dialog: Fitzsimmons.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That commie beatnik? What's she
dialog: doing with him? Wait'll I tell
dialog: Charlie.
speaker_heading: DOLORES
text: First a nerd and then a weirdo.
dialog: What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll
dialog: tell Charlie.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT  DRIVING
text: Peggy on Michael's bike, clasped around him. Her eyes closed,
text: enjoying the wind blowing in her hair. They head out of town.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION
text: Michael pumps gas. Peggy walks to the washrooms. Looking
text: around she waits a beat, then enters the men's.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S WASHROOM
text: With all the aplomb of a divorcee, Peggy takes a quarter and
text: deposits it in a condom machine. She puts the packet in her
text: skirt pocket, pulls out the joints and stares at them for a
text: beat. She checks her hair in the mirror and exits.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION
text: Michael pumps air into the tires, bunched against a building.
text: Peggy approaches him, holding up a joint, smiling
text: conspiratorially. She lights it, inhales deeply, then passes
text: it to him. He smiles back at her, a bit surprised, but still
text: takes the joint and inhales.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD
text: They drive up to a mountain top, Peggy wearing the leather
text: jacket. She directs Michael with one arm.
text: The motorcycle is parked. Peggy and Michael lie on the grass,
text: staring down at the town lights below. Michael inhales the
text: joint, then passes it to Peggy.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: This is great reefer.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really
dialog: old... (inhales) Travels well
dialog: though.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know, the world looks a lot
dialog: better from up here.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The world is fantastic. It's the
dialog: ultimate absurd circus. I am shot
text: from a cannon into the energy.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: What are you shooting for?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't
dialog: wait to get out of here. I'm gonna
dialog: write. I'm gonna check out of this
dialog: bourgeois motel. Push myself away
dialog: from the dinner table and say 'No
dialog: more JellO for me, Mom.'
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Don't you get along with your
dialog: parents?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The only thing my father digs is
dialog: cold, green money. All my mother
dialog: cares about is her standing at the
dialog: country club.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: They care about you. They're just a
dialog: different generation.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey what's with you? I thought you
dialog: were cool. You rode my bike. You
dialog: blew some pot.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What's your scene Miss Majorette?
dialog: You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and
text: graze around with all the other
dialog: sheep for the rest of your life?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I already did that. I want to be a
dialog: dancer, I want to dance.
text: Peggy takes off her sweater, kicks off her shoes and begins
text: to dance. Her eyes are closed, her body silhouetted by the
text: moon. Michael is transfixed. After a few beats, he walks over
text: to her. He stretches out his arms and places them around her
text: neck. They sway together for several beats, their bodies
text: touching. Peggy opens her eyes and sees Michael gazing at her
text: tenderly.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You know, I had you pegged all
dialog: wrong.
text: Michael kisses Peggy. She responds passionately.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: A ray of oneness piercing the
text: solitude. Falling bodies in the
dialog: ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a
dialog: chapter in my memoirs of desire.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Is that one of your poems?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, I just made that up. Do
dialog: you want to hear one?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I'd love to.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (eyes ablaze)
dialog: Okay. Here's a new one. It's called
dialog: Tenderness.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd
dialog: scream
text: Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of
dialog: bitterness.
text: In the madhouse of Dr. Dread
text: Razor shreds of rat puke fall
dialog: On my bare arms
text: (sees Peggy grimace; he
dialog: calms down)
dialog: I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to
dialog: impress you.
dialog: (kisses her)
text: Peggy is falling for it. He fumbles with her bra straps.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Michael... you're as good as you
dialog: looked.
text: His other hand reaches to undo her skirt.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'll respect you for eternity.
dialog: (reciting tenderly)
dialog: 'When you are old and gray, and
text: full of sleep, And nodding by the
dialog: fire, Take down this book, and
dialog: slowly read, And dream of the soft
dialog: look your eyes had once."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I didn't write that. That's Yeats.
text: Peggy is moved by the beauty of the poem. She sits up, leans
text: over Michael, runs her hand through his hair, almost
dialog: motherly.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I envy you. You have your whole
dialog: life ahead of you and you know
dialog: exactly what you want to do.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But forget the rat puke; write
text: something beautiful.
text: Peggy lies back down on the ground. Michael takes her hand
text: and kisses it.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You know, this isn't really
dialog: happening.

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: At my age? Don't be silly.
scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: Thank God for that.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't

scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: Yes but I was a boy. And I still
dialog: had hell to pay.
speaker_heading: PEGGY

scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: All right. But this better be good.

scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: Do you know how ridiculous you

speaker_heading: PEGGY

scene_heading: MR. KELCHER

dialog: Oh boy, that's another thing that's

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No offense, but for a person who

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: How come you never ask me any

dialog: What about your family? What about

speaker_heading: RICHARD

dialog: Good. You're discreet. I like that

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Richard! They don't have any! They

speaker_heading: RICHARD

dialog: feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's
dialog: right. Teenagers are nuts.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with
dialog: a lifetime of emotional experiences
dialog: you couldn't possibly understand.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster

dialog: the one who put on the brakes. And
dialog: you know why?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Why?
text: Charlie cups her face in his hands, pouring out his heart.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Because nothing else matters.
dialog: That's the great thing about love.
dialog: Every time we argue, every time
dialog: something goes wrong, and I know

scene_heading: MR. KELCHER

scene_heading: MR. KELCHER

speaker_heading: MADDY

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Come on. What's with you and

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I bet Dolores told Charlie.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: That loudmouthed little bitch~
speaker_heading: MADDY

speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: MADDY
dialog: But I always thought that you would
dialog: marry Charlie, Carol would marry
dialog: Walter, and I would marry Arthur.
dialog: We'd all live on the same street
dialog: and take our kids to the park
dialog: together and have barbecues every
dialog: Sunday. It'll spoil everything if

speaker_heading: PEGGY

scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: This is your great invention?
dialog: (to Mrs. Kelcher)

scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER

speaker_heading: PEGGY
text: Instead of a girdle. And light as a

scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER.
dialog: Jack, I think she's got something

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: And we won't just sell them in

scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: That's all well and good, but we

speaker_heading: PEGGY

scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Then it's true, dammit! I had a

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You know I never could stand your
dialog: sarcasm.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue.
dialog: Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: And why do you always refer to
dialog: yourself in the third person, like
dialog: Napoleon? How come it always turns
dialog: into an argument with you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look, I've got the hair, got the
dialog: eyes, got the teeth, I got the car.
dialog: I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Charlie,. I've been trying to

dialog: point? It's over.
dialog: (crying)

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: That's just it. You can always get
dialog: to me. There's this window in my

dialog: open, you climb in. Unless I close
dialog: it now, nothing's ever going to be
dialog: different!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But what has to be different?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Everything. I have a good head for

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What! What about the group and my

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You don't know zip! You think I'm

dialog: Look, I'm desperate. I'll try
dialog: anything. But what if you can't
dialog: snap me out of it?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No offense, but you're pretty out
dialog: of it now.
scene_heading: INT. RICHARD'S GARAGE
text: Peggy sits in an old recliner. Richard holds a small,
text: batteryoperated revolving disc up in front of Peggy's closed
text: eyes, then puts it down and picks up a notepad and pen.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You are completely relaxed. When I
dialog: count to three, you will open your
dialog: eyes. One... two... three.
dialog: (Peggy's eyes flutter
dialog: open)
dialog: We'll start with something easy.
dialog: What is your name?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: (trancelike)
dialog: Peggy Sue Kelcher.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or, Peggy Bodell.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Ah..... they're very tiny... they
text: look like a fingernail made out of
dialog: an erector set...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What will they be made of?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I think it's called silicon.
dialog: Charlie told me that.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Silicon is from sand.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
text: We were lying in the sand. It was
dialog: my eighteenth birthday... We were
dialog: so awkward... I would have married
dialog: him anyway...
text: Peggy starts to shift in the chair. Her shorts hike up, her
text: legs spread slightly. This is not lost on Richard. Weird,
text: guttural sounds begin to emanate from his throat.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: In the future, will you have to
dialog: marry a girl before you have sex
dialog: with her?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: No. The Pill will change all that.
dialog: Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We
dialog: were just too young.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You mean you'll give a girl a pill
dialog: and she'll want to have sex?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: No. The Pill will be for birth
dialog: control. But girls do like sex.
dialog: Maybe not the first time.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Will you take of f your blouse?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Yes, every day.
text: (taking her blouse off 
dialog: getting spaced)
dialog: Maybe I shouldn't have worn that
dialog: dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea.
dialog: That's why they made me Queen.
text: Peggy's meandering makes Richard nervous.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Richard, are you in there?
text: Richard frantically tries to put Peggy's blouse back on.
text: She's limp and unresponsive.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap
dialog: you out of it.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I couldn't help it  I loved him.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: One... two... three.
dialog: (claps twice)
dialog: You are now awake.
text: Richard kneels on top of Peggy as she wakes up, fumbling the
text: buttons at her breasts. Peggy comes to, as Richard jumps off.
text: She buttons her blouse, furious.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Richard! You should be ashamed of
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Me? You went crazy! You started
dialog: taking your clothes off. I was
dialog: putting them back on for you.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: That's just perfect isn't it? Did
dialog: it work? Did you find out why I
dialog: came back?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I think it has something to do with
dialog: your birthday. You were rambling. I
dialog: didn't understand the rest.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: God dammit! How'm I gonna got out
dialog: of here?
text: Peggy grabs a glass beaker and hurls it against the wall.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Hey! Do you have any idea how much
dialog: those beakers cost? I usually
dialog: charge for hypnosis.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I

dialog: believe you.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Mom, how about a machine that's

scene_heading: INT. KELCHER DINING ROOM

scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER

text: She moves the Jell-O mold.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: No, just a friend of mine. I don't

scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER
dialog: What does Charlie think about that?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You know Mom, it's okay to have
dialog: male friends. Besides, it's over
dialog: with me and Charlie.
scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: What? When did it happen? Your dad
dialog: and I always expected you two to
dialog: get married.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets
dialog: married. Case closed. Period. Mom,
dialog: if you could live your life over
dialog: again, would you do the same thing?
dialog: Get married and settle down after
dialog: high school?
speaker_heading: MRS KELCHER
dialog: Of course I loved your Lather.
dialog: I remember once being offered a
dialog: scholarship to art school. But I
dialog: turned it down.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Why?
scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER
dialog: All the college girls I knew were
dialog: so well, dressed. I was worried
dialog: that I wouldn't fit in. I didn't
dialog: have the right clothes. I was so
dialog: silly. But, I don't have many
dialog: regrets, and besides, r don't have
dialog: time to worry about the past. But
dialog: Charlie. I hope you know what

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: But Mom helped.
scene_heading: MR. FITZSIMMONS
dialog: You know, you should open a

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: It's incredibly difficult to make

dialog: You have to get up at five in the
dialog: morning to go to the market, you
dialog: have problems with spoilage,
dialog: employee pilferage, and just try
dialog: and collect from the credit card
dialog: companies. They take months to pay.

dialog: Let's do something.
text: Michael makes a move towards Peggy, with lust in his eyes.
speaker_heading: PEGGY

scene_heading: EXT. GHETTO STREET - NIGHT
text: Michael and Peggy pull up on the motorcycle in front of

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Utah? I thought you'd be going to
dialog: New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Rita. I met her last summer. She's
dialog: cool. You'll really dig her. She's
dialog: got this great little cabin in the

dialog: she raises chickens. I'll write and
dialog: the two of you can take care of the
dialog: chickens to support us.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: (astounded)

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But what about the other night? We

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Michael, you and I are light years
dialog: apart. You should go, but not with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But we had heat baby. Passion!
dialog: Fire! We owe it to ourselves to

dialog: At least one more time.
speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Ssh. He's great.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble
dialog: without a cause.

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I thought I knew everything about
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Can we split now?
text: Peggy and Michael unobtrusively slip out of the club. Charlie

scene_heading: EXT. KELCHER HOUSE  NIGHT
text: Michael and Peggy pull up. Peggy gets off the bike and gives

dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Oh no!
scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: Didn't call, them pantyhose,

scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER
dialog: Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it?
dialog: Like leotards.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: He's a liar! He has no such thing!
dialog: It's my own fault. I should have

scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
scene_heading: MRS. KELCHER
dialog: Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Oh, you're both so naive.
scene_heading: MR. KELCHER
dialog: Look young lady, I grew up through

dialog: get up and deal with the public,
dialog: the bank and the bill collectors.
dialog: And on the seventh day, when God

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I was at Lena's last night. You

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Stop being defensive. I want to
dialog: help you. I wrote a song for you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're kidding. You wrote a song?
dialog: Is it about a guilty girl and a

text: Peggy takes a piece of paper from her purse.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Not exactly, but with your great

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins
dialog: came to hear me last night. He told

dialog: forget it. My parents tell me to
dialog: forget it.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Just take a look at it.
dialog: (hands him the lyric)
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If you took the trouble to write
dialog: it, then sure, I'll take a look at

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY
text: Peggy and Charlie stand by their open locker.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Does this mean you like me again?

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause
dialog: I'm never going to give up on us.
dialog: It's easy to fall apart in a
dialog: crisis. It's easy to be selfish and
dialog: say goodbye and good luck. But this
dialog: is more than love. This is a mental
dialog: decision. Just wait till tomorrow,

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I wish she hadn't.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I'm not afraid. I know exactly when

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: If you believe it, darling, then I

dialog: what happened yesterday.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: But I'm remembering the future.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Right now you're just browsing

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: BARNEY

scene_heading: INT. LODGE - NIGHT
text: A onestory, pitchroof building. The sign over the entrance
text: reads.: THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN. Underneath the sign is

scene_heading: INT. LODGE  ANTEROOM

dialog: Welcome, Peggy Sue. It's nice to

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You know, you're a lucky girl. You

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Ah... thank you.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Let me take your jacket, Lilla.

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Do you have to wear that hat?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: It wouldn't be a lodge without
dialog: hats.

text: through the doorway.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Don't you worry. I'll be watching
dialog: after you.
scene_heading: INT. LODGE  MAIN ROOM
text: A large meeting hall. The room is draped, and brightly lit
text: with fluorescent lights. At one end sits a large, gold
text: painted wood throne. On either side are large candle holders,
text: with lit candles. A small table serves as an altar in front
text: of the platform. On a footstool is a potted plane with an
text: artificial bird perched on its top. The throne and altar look
text: like a set left over from a summer stock "Macbeth".
text: Peggy and Barney enter. Several men lead Peggy away from
text: Barney to the throne. One man places a go1den cape around her
text: shoulders. They lead her up the platform to the throne.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Hey, George. Get the lights.
text: The LIGHTS are DIMMED. The room is lit by the candles.
text: The men form a semicircle around Peggy. Old men at the end
text: of their lives, they are serious and passionate about the
text: possibilities of life beyond this world. One by one, four men
text: from either end of the line approach the altar with
text: offerings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose.
text: The men rejoin the line.
text: LEO COOPER, a tall, whitehaired man, takes two steps
text: forward. The other men begin to sing a Gregorian chant.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: (to Peggy)
dialog: Are you ready, dear?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Leo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Fasten your seat belts. Here we go.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Lord of the Universe, Vast and
dialog: Mighty One. Ruler of Light, King
dialog: of~ the sun. Creator of earth, air,
text: fire and water.
dialog: (kneeling down)
dialog: We adore thee and invoke thee!
dialog: Grant thine aid.
dialog: Look with favor upon us as we
dialog: witness the regeneration of man. We
dialog: behold the innocent endeavors of
dialog: singleminded men and women. For we
dialog: are the company of unbodied souls
dialog: and immortal angels. We ask thy
dialog: intervention, that this girl may
dialog: return to thee on the wings of your

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: This is never going to work.
text: The old men form a circle in front of Peggy. They begin to
text: circumambulate east to west, intoning together, their heads
text: bowed. As Barney passes in front of Peggy, he winks at her.
text: She smiles back.
speaker_heading: MEN
dialog: Fount of life, Chariot of the
dialog: Spirit, Womb of the Mother, reclaim
dialog: thy child of light.
text: We HEAR a clap of distant THUNDER. Peggy trembles. The
text: artificial bird falls off the plant. Peggy is struck with
text: amazement. She begins to glow, poised to take off. The men
dialog: continue to chant while:
speaker_heading: LEO (O.S.)
dialog: The name of your love is sacrifice.
dialog: We offer up this girl, that her
dialog: soul may find its home.
text: Suddenly a door is opened, a gust of wind pours in and
text: extinguishes the candles, plunging the hall into darkness.
speaker_heading: LEO (0.S.)
dialog: Nothing to worry about. Somebody
dialog: get the lights.
text: The LIGHTS are TURNED ON. All the men look to the throne.
text: Peggy is gone. They are speechless for a couple of beats.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (chipper)
dialog: Well, the girl's gone. Let's play
dialog: some poker.
text: CLOSE ON BARNEY  He smiles, happy that she made it. George
text: crosses to the wall, reaches behind the drapes and presses a
text: button. The wall slides open to reveal a fullyequipped card
text: room. The men shuffle in.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND THE LODGE
text: Charlie carries Peggy off towards his car, one hand covering
text: her mouth. Peggy struggles. When they reach the car, he puts
text: her down. She's still wrapped in her golden robe.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: What the hell did you do that for?
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I was trying to save you. They were
dialog: going to vaporize you.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Don't be ridiculous! They're just a
dialog: bunch of harmless old men. My
dialog: grandfather was in there.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're going to listen to me.
text: Charlie tries to Lead Peggy into the car.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I'm not getting in that blue
text: monstrosity.
text: Charlie pushes her inside, Peggy climbs back out. Charlie
text: takes her hand and drags her up a hill behind the lodge hall.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Let me got! Where are you taking
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right here. Now sit down.
text: Charlie sits her down on the ground. She's impatient and
text: hopping mad.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive
dialog: you for everything. I know what
dialog: you've been going through. You're
dialog: just scared. I was scared, too, but
dialog: I'm not anymore.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: How could you possibly know what
dialog: I've been going through?
text: Thunder and lightning. It starts to rain.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Because I love you, damnit! I had a
dialog: long talk with your father
dialog: yesterday and we decided that the
dialog: best thing for us to do is get
dialog: married and settle down. Right
dialog: away.
text: Peggy jumps up, exploding to Charlie.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: What do you mean you and my father
dialog: decided? Who the hell are you to
dialog: plan my life? Let's get married and
dialog: live happily ever after. Bullshit.
dialog: I got knocked up. I had to marry
dialog: you. I never had a choice.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You betrayed me, Charlie. You were
dialog: never there for me or the children.
dialog: And now you come and tell me,
dialog: "Peggy, you're scared." Of course
dialog: I'm scared. If you knew what I knew
dialog: you'd be scared shitless.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're crazy! You're really out of
dialog: your mind!
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy
dialog: enough to marry you twice. There's
dialog: a lot of things I can't change. I
dialog: can't even think about them. I
dialog: tried. But I couldn't even help
dialog: Rosalie.
dialog: (tears start)
dialog: I don't want to be bitter. I'm a
dialog: naturally optimistic person. But
dialog: you took advantage of that.
text: Charlie bends down to comfort her, in tears. He hugs Peggy
text: and strokes her hair.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, Peggy. My poor Peggy. It's all
dialog: my fault. I'm so sorry. I won't
dialog: bother you anymore. I promise.
dialog: Please stop crying. Please.
text: Peggy starts to compose herself.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Will you take me back to my
dialog: grandparents?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Of course.
text: Charlie helps her up. Be reaches into his pocket and takes
text: out a small box, handing it to Peggy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's almost your birthday. I wasn't
dialog: sure when you were coming back, so
dialog: I brought your present up here.
text: With a slow, growing remembrance, Peggy opens the box. Inside
text: is the gold locket Peggy was wearing at the reunion.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: (anguished)
dialog: Oh, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: It opens, too. Look inside.
text: Peggy opens the locket. She shivers with recognition.
scene_heading: INSERT - LOCKET
text: Two photos, one of Peggy, one of Charlie, as children.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Scott and Beth. Where did you get
dialog: these?
speaker_heading: CHARM E
dialog: Who's Scott and Beth? Your mother
dialog: gave me our picture. That's you and
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: So are Scott and Beth.
text: Peggy leans into Charlie, throwing her arms around him,
text: holding on for dear life. She looks up at him, their
text: foreheads touching.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I know.
text: Charlie kisses her, passionately. The locket drops to the

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: EXT. ON THE HILL - LATER
text: Charlie and Peggy are lying on the ground, gazing up. A flash
text: of lightning streaks across the sky.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I think we should get out of here.
dialog: It's going to rain.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: (musing)
dialog: Do you think anybody in the Fifties
dialog: ever made love on a bed?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What the hell is that?
text: Flying high above them is an enormous, glowing, liquid neon
text: kite. The center of the kite inscribed in lights, flashing
text: like a marquee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEGGY SUE.
text: The kite begins to descend towards them. Peggy jumps to her
text: feet and races towards it. She grabs the tail and starts to
text: sail away with the kite. Charlie chases after her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Peggy! Where're you going? Come
dialog: back!
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I've got to go now.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But I love you. I'll love you
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll
dialog: love you for twenty years.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come back to me.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I'm trying.
text: As Charlie watches helplessly, a huge bolt of lightning
text: strikes his car. Peggy smiles. The men from the lodge run
text: outside. They look up and above the blazing car and see Peggy
text: floating away. Peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and
text: blows him a kiss. Charlie begins to run, following the kite
text: cord to its source. He finds Richard, struggling to restrain
text: the runaway kite.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Richard, do something!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I can't! It's out of control!
text: Suddenly the cord breaks. Peggy floats away.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Peggy!
text: Charlie, Richard and the old men behold Peggy, bobbing and
text: dipping playfully in the sky. We begin to HEAR Charlie's
text: VOICE singing "Peggy Sue" O.S. Peggy looks down with wonder
text: at the earth, and then like a comet, soars into the
text: blackness. In an instant she becomes a star.

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: What about Janet?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: PEGGY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Everyone. Maddie and Arthur, Carol

dialog: of the book.
text: ANGLE ON BOOK: the front page bears the title "The Pilgrim

dialog: Night".
text: Peggy smiles but shakes her head.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: It couldn't be me. I hardly knew

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll just set it right here.
text: He places the book on her bedside table as he sits back down.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Charlie, I had a strange
dialog: experience. I went back to high

dialog: with you. And you and Walter and

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, God, Dion.
speaker_heading: PEGGY
