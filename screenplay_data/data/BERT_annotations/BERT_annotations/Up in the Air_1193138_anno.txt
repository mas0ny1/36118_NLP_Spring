dialog: Start with the little things. The

text: The collectables and knick-knacks.
dialog: Feel the weight as it adds up. Now,
dialog: start adding the larger stuff. Your
dialog: clothes, table top appliances,

dialog: heavy at this point - Go Bigger.
dialog: Your couch, your bed, your kitchen
dialog: table. Stuff it all in... Your car,

speaker_heading: NATALIE (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Hearing the words "You've been let

dialog: scary. But consider the following -
dialog: (using Ryan's line)
dialog: Anybody who ever built an empire,
dialog: or changed the world, sat where you
dialog: are now. And it's because they sat
dialog: there that they were able to do it.

speaker_heading: NATALIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now Ned, I'm going to need you to
dialog: go back to your desk and start
dialog: putting together your things. As a
dialog: favor to me, I'd appreciate it if

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE

dialog: 
text: We find Ryan, Alex, and Natalie at a stand up table. They're now

speaker_heading: (TO NATALIE)

speaker_heading: NATALIE

speaker_heading: CONFERENCE LEADER
dialog: I'm going to need you to all put

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Think she'll be okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Look...

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A nice two story yacht that was obviously purchased before
text: the bubble popped. Inside the galley, a group is playing

dialog: singing "Time After Time".
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, near the back, Ryan and Alex sit with their legs
text: hanging off the back of the hull.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Back home, I don't get to act the way
dialog: I do with you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: That's why I don't have a "back home".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I know. You're so cool. "Mr. Empty
dialog: Back Pack".
dialog: 
text: Ryan emotionally stumbles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You know about the back pack?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I googled you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You did?
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's what us modern girls do when
dialog: we have a crush.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Did it bother you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well, that depends. Is the bag
dialog: empty because you hate people or
dialog: just the baggage they bring along?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I don't hate people. I'm not
dialog: exactly a hermit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You just don't want to be tied down?
dialog: The whole responsibility thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I don't think it's even that...
dialog: I... First time I ever flew, I was
dialog: sixteen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're not going to answer? You're
dialog: just going to tell me a story?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (smiles, continues story)
dialog: It was January and I had just
dialog: gotten my driver's license. The
dialog: lakes were frozen over, so we piled
dialog: into my car and hit the ice to do
dialog: donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit
text: a soft spot and the hood of my car
dialog: tilted up and I was sinking
text: backwards into the water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I literally started to drown.
text: Within a few seconds, I black out.
text: Then, I wake up in the sky. I'm in a
text: helicopter, laying on a stretcher.
dialog: This guy in a uniform is telling me I
text: was minutes away from dying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh my God.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Right?
dialog: (relives it for a second)
dialog: So just as we're hovering over the
dialog: hospital, I sit up. And from there,
dialog: I could see the whole western
dialog: horizon. We'd been flying twenty
text: minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a
dialog: city I'd thought of as remote,
dialog: halfway across the state... a
dialog: foreign capital.
speaker_heading: (A BEAT)
dialog: My parents had taught me we lived
dialog: in the best place on Earth, but now
dialog: I could see the world was really
dialog: just one place and comparing didn't
dialog: make much sense. And I remember
dialog: thinking - Don't tell me this isn't
dialog: an age of miracles. Don't tell me
dialog: we can't be everywhere at once.
dialog: 
text: The idea settles in. Ryan returns to the point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I don't know what originally
dialog: sparked the back pack. I probably
dialog: needed to be alone. Recently, I've
dialog: been thinking that maybe I needed
dialog: to empty the bag before I knew what
dialog: to put back in.
dialog: 
text: And now they kiss. It's notably different from their previous
dialog: kisses. Now, when they lock lips, we are reminded why people
text: kiss in the first place.
dialog: 
text: Then, all of a sudden, the lights go out on the boat. The
text: motor has stopped. Ryan and Alex look back to find the
text: software dude stepping out of the galley, drunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOFTWARE DUDE
dialog: Hey... I think we're out of gas.
dialog: 
text: Ryan and Alex look out to shore... about 500 yards away. For
text: whatever reason, they just start cracking up.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PONTOON BOAT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Ryan and Alex are huddled under a blanket in the corner of

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: RYAN
speaker_heading: (DISAPPOINTED)
dialog: Oh... Okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (notices, teasing)
dialog: Oh, no. I made you feel cheap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yeah, all right... Just leave the
text: money on the dresser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (SWEETLY)
dialog: I'll text you later so we can swap
dialog: schedules.
dialog: 
text: Alex gives him a peck. Ryan takes her wrist so she can't leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I can't remember the last time I
dialog: enjoyed spending time with someone
dialog: as much as you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Neither can I.
dialog: 
text: They kiss again and he lets go. Alex leaves and the door

scene_heading: INT. CAFE - MIAMI HILTON - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Ryan and Natalie have a quiet breakfast. Natalie looks pretty
dialog: worse for wear.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, after a little silent eating...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Last night got a little out of
dialog: hand. I said things... I don't
dialog: remember everything I said. I just
dialog: didn't want you to think...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Just relax. It was nice to see you
dialog: cut loose. So, did you wake him up
dialog: or slip out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: This morning... Your new friend.
dialog: Did you wake him for an awkward
dialog: good bye or just slip out so he
dialog: could feel like a whore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
speaker_heading: (NOT PROUD)
dialog: I... just left.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Protocol is always tricky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: I didn't know what was right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sometimes there really is no right
dialog: thing to do.
dialog: 
text: This doesn't comfort her.

speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: What happened to Alex?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Had to skip town early to make a
dialog: meeting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: That's too bad. Where does she live?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Chicago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: You thinking of going to see her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I don't know. We just don't have
dialog: that kind of relationship.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: What kind of relationship do you
dialog: have?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It's, you know. Casual.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Sounds pretty special.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It works for us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Think there's any future there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Never thought about it. What's
dialog: going on here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Really never thought about it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (a good lie)
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: NATALIE

dialog: things? How does it not even cross
dialog: your mind that you might want to
dialog: have a future with somebody?
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It's simple, you know that moment
dialog: when you look into someone's eyes
dialog: and you feel them looking right
dialog: into your soul, and the whole world
text: goes quiet for a second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: (finally, a break through)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Right. Well, I don't.

speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: You're an asshole.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Oh come on, I'm just dicking
dialog: around. I need your help...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Don't you think it's worth giving
dialog: her a chance?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: A chance to what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: A chance at something real?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Natalie, your definition of "real"
dialog: is going to evolve as you get
dialog: older...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Would you stop condescending for
dialog: one second? Or is that one of the
dialog: principles of your bullshit
dialog: philosophy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Bullshit philosophy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: The isolation? The traveling? Is
dialog: that supposed to be charming?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No, it's simply a life choice.
dialog: 72.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE

speaker_heading: RYAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Screw you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Well, screw you too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: You've set up a way of life that
dialog: basically makes it impossible for
dialog: you to make any human connections.
dialog: Now, somehow, this woman runs the
dialog: gauntlet of your ridiculous "life
dialog: choice" and comes out the other end
dialog: with a smile - Just so you can call
dialog: her casual. Jesus. I need to grow
dialog: up? You're a twelve year old.

speaker_heading: CRAIG GREGORY

speaker_heading: NATALIE

speaker_heading: SAMUELS
dialog: I work here for seventeen years and

dialog: 
text: Ryan fights the urge to jump in. He is sitting next to
text: Natalie, but just out of view of the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: It's perfectly normal to be upset.
dialog: However, the sooner you can tell
dialog: yourself that there are greater
dialog: opportunities waiting for you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAMUELS
dialog: Greater opportunities? I'm fifty-
dialog: seven-fucking years old!
dialog: 
text: Mr. Samuels is now on the verge of tears. Eyes red.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Anybody who ever built an empire,

dialog: are now. And it's because they sat
dialog: there that they were able to do it.
dialog: 
text: We remain in the room with Natalie and Ryan, but we hear Mr.

speaker_heading: NATALIE (CONT'D)
dialog: There's a packet in front of you.
dialog: 
text: Samuels picks up the packet and opens it.

dialog: I want you to take some time and

speaker_heading: NATALIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NATALIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: (AND AGAIN)

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm just not sure if it's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Look. You know. I'm not the wedding

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (PROUDLY)
dialog: Jim designed it.
dialog: 
text: JIM raises a hand. This is Julie's husband-to-be and we can

speaker_heading: JULIE
speaker_heading: (LIGHTS UP)
dialog: Oh great! They go over there.
dialog: 
text: Julie points to a table and Ryan walks over. When he gets there,
text: we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of America. It's
text: overwhelming. All of a sudden, his effort seems miniscule.
dialog: 
text: Ryan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities
text: where they were taken. He backs away to see it as a whole and
text: his addition has already become invisible.
dialog: 
text: Ryan returns to the conversation with his sister and Alex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What gave you the idea to do
dialog: something so...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
speaker_heading: (HELPS)
dialog: ... Substantial?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg
dialog: invested in this real estate
dialog: venture right now. So when we went
dialog: over our finances, a honeymoon just
dialog: didn't seem affordable this
dialog: second... So I thought... Hey, just
dialog: because we can't travel doesn't
dialog: mean we can't have pictures.
dialog: 
text: The idea of this lands on Ryan pretty hard.

speaker_heading: ALEX

dialog: Must be a nice development.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (CORRECTING)
dialog: It's a community, not a development.
dialog: The concept is turn-key everything.
dialog: You buy a maintenance contract with
dialog: the home. We'll whack your weeds,
dialog: we'll even change the light bulb.
dialog: Furniture? You buy your own or choose
dialog: a package. Seamless traditionalism,
dialog: yet all the perks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Nice.
dialog: 
text: Ryan and Alex make eye contact. There's a joy in their
text: connection amongst the ramblings of their company.

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We all need a place to call our

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Yeah, I know... Isn't he great?

speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: He's going to make a great husband.
dialog: 
text: There's a moment where they just look at each other and
