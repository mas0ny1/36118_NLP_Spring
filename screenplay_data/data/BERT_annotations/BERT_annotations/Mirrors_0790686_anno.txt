scene_heading: 1A INT. NIGHT - HARLEM SUBWAY STATION 1A
text: A subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform
dialog: somewhere in Harlem.
text: A man runs for his life in the deserted space. He's an African
text: American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform.
text: He turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards
text: the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed.
text: Desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back,
text: searching for an exit or a place to hide. He sees a door to the
text: public restroom and runs inside.
scene_heading: 1B INT. NIGHT - SUBWAY PUBLIC RESTROOM 1B
text: The place is deserted as well. One of the mirrors is smashed
text: while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt -
text: The neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of
dialog: the dark.
text: The man checks each stall one at a time.
text: His face lights up as he looks inside the last one-
text: A SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO
text: CRAWL THROUGH.
text: He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight.
text: After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover-
text: A wall of bricks.
text: Panic returns to his eyes. He slowly opens the stall door,
text: fearful of what could be waiting outside.
text: A FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard.
text: He quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. Frozen.
dialog: Silence.
text: His heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the
text: sound. The place is empty.
text: The room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights.
text: He moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror.
text: His image is fragmented and deformed. It resembles a Cubist
dialog: portrait.

dialog: I'm sorry... I... I... I wasn't trying
dialog: to get away...
text: He talks to his own reflection in the mirror-
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: No, please don't...
text: He approaches and starts crying like a child. His head resting
text: against the mirror, he pleads for his life. Then, seeing the
text: dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another
text: extreme. He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. Too
dialog: frantically-
text: A piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground.
text: Immediately, he bends down to pick it up but-
text: HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE,
text: WATCHING HIM.
text: Looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become
dialog: independent. A separate being...
text: Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double.
text: The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects
text: the neon lights just like a knife blade.
text: His eyes turn cold with fear when-
text: HIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT!
text: IN REALITY, THE MAN HAS NOT MOVED AN INCH, YET HIS THROAT RIPS
text: OPEN, RELEASING A RIVER OF BLOOD.
text: Void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his
text: jugular from end to end.
text: In reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on
text: the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED.

text: The sunlight is diffused through the drawn curtains of the
dialog: living room.
text: Seen in the reflection of the TV-set, a man is sleeping on the
text: couch. He switches off the alarm and rises to go into the
dialog: bathroom.
scene_heading: 3 BATHROOM - CONTINUITY 3
text: Like a thick fog, the steam from the shower fills the bathroom.
text: The shower turns off. A hand reaches out to wipe away the mist
text: on the mirror above the sink, revealing-
text: The face of BEN CARSON, 41 years old. His eyes reflect the
dialog: hardships of life. A life, that from the lines on his face, we

scene_heading: BULLET SCARS.

scene_heading: 4 BEDROOM - CONTINUITY 4
text: Ben finishes getting dressed and walks to the half opened

speaker_heading: ANGELA (CONT'D)
dialog: You shaved?

speaker_heading: ANGELA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LARRY

scene_heading: 9 INT. DAY - LARRY'S' OFFICE 9
text: Larry takes a seat and briefly looks over the messages and files
dialog: that have been dropped off on his desk-
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: So did you find an apartment yet?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, not yet.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You need a place to stay?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, I'm staying at my sister's, in

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I didn't know you had a sister. What
dialog: does she do?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: She's a bartender.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: That's not too good for you! Anyway,

speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I ran into Amy the other day. How are

dialog: subject.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, why did you want to see me Ben?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You know what I want. I'm ready to
dialog: come back, I'm feeling much better
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Listen Ben, I can't bring you back on
dialog: the force. Nobody in the squad wants
dialog: you around right now. I'm sorry but I
dialog: have to be honest with you. You
dialog: understand, right?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Larry, I'm telling you, I'm ready.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: If it was up to me, I would bring you
dialog: back tomorrow, but I'm not the only
dialog: one who decides. Listen, I think I've
dialog: got something else for you. I know a
dialog: guy at the Mayflower corporation and
dialog: they need someone to watch over one of
dialog: their department stores.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?! Come on Larry, a security guard
dialog: job... I'm not ready to retire yet!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Hey! I'm just trying to help here. I
dialog: know you're over qualified for that
dialog: position but it's a good opportunity
dialog: for you for the time being...until the
dialog: situation here quiets down. Also the
dialog: money is not that bad.
text: Ben is having a hard time to contain his anger.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You need the money, Ben. You're in the
dialog: middle of a divorce and you've got

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yes, their night watchman hasn't shown
dialog: up for work in several days. They need
dialog: someone right away. Take it, relax,
dialog: and we will talk about your situation
dialog: again in a couple months.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah, in a couple months... I gave

dialog: We discover a whole different world-

text: Office, forensic scientists with tape recorders in hand,
dialog: describe the corpses.
dialog: We are a world away from the Hollywood clichés of neatly laid
text: out, immaculate cadavers. Here, some of the corpses have reached
text: a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in
text: contorted positions, expressing their ultimate agony before
text: dying. From the homeless man fished out of the river, to the
text: woman killed by gun shots, each corpse tells his own story...
text: Amidst the group of doctors 35-year-old AMY, deeply immersed in
text: an autopsy, is interrupted by her cell phone.
text: Amy checks the display for the incoming call- BEN. She hesitates
text: for a moment and doesn't answer the call.

text: Caught in the pouring rain, Ben has taken shelter under the

dialog: to block the traffic and city commotion -
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (on Amy's voicemail)
dialog: Amy, it's me... I just wanted to let you
dialog: know that I got a job today... It's
dialog: nothing special, just a security guard
dialog: job... If you still want to go ahead
dialog: with it, we can sign the divorce
dialog: papers... I mean, if that's what you
dialog: really want.
dialog: (he hesitates)
dialog: I've been thinking about Michael's
dialog: birthday tomorrow. It would be nice if
dialog: we could celebrate it together ... You

scene_heading: 13 EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE 13
text: On 38th Street, just off of Broadway, the Mayflower has
text: withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it
dialog: to shut down-
text: The damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of
dialog: the building-
text: The fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems
text: to have spread all the way up to the top. Some of the windows
text: are shattered, while others are boarded up. What was once an
text: impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's
text: architecture standing on one of Manhattan's most dynamic
text: streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation.
text: What is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost
text: ship, abandoned in the heart of the city.
dialog: 9.
scene_heading: 14 INT. DAY - MAYFLOWER 14
text: The last beams of daylight shine through the broken windowpanes.
text: Inside the department store, everything has remained the same
text: since the fire, as if time stood still. The display cases, the
text: departments, the mannequins, and even the clothes are all burnt
text: or blackened by the fire. A thick coat of soot covers the floor
text: and rainwater drips down all over the place.
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
dialog: It's been five years and they're still
dialog: in a legal battle with the insurance
dialog: companies. Even cleaning up that mess
dialog: is impossible...
text: In his dark brown uniform, the daytime security guard, LORENZO
text: SAPELLI, 60's, seems pleased to guide Ben through what was once
text: a temple of beauty and vanity.
speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: You know, the Meredith family acquired
dialog: this building after St. John's
dialog: Hospital closed in 1952. It was the
dialog: very first Mayflower to open on the
dialog: East Coast.
text: On the cracked walls, THE HUGE 1920 MIRRORS that have survived
text: the flames reflect merely the remnants of the past. The
text: customers are long gone and have been replaced by pigeons flying
text: in and out of the gaps in the roof.
speaker_heading: LORENZO (CONT'D)
dialog: The company wants us to patrol the
dialog: premises every couple of hours, but I
dialog: do my rounds every three hours and
dialog: that's more than enough. Anyway,
dialog: you'll see, there's not much going on.
dialog: It's pretty calm around here.
text: Ben follows Lorenzo through the burnt display counters. He
text: listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere. This place makes him
text: uncomfortable. It's not only the lingering smell of a fire, but
text: also a sense of death that hangs over it.
text: The whistling of the wind through the store's old ventilation
text: system sounds like faraway voices.
text: Ben and Lorenzo appear at the top of the staircase of the 2nd
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: LORENZO (CONT'D)
dialog: Here you go... Men's department, or
dialog: what's left of it anyway...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: 14 CONTINUED: 14
text: Ben observes the surroundings- Yet another spectacle of
text: devastation.
speaker_heading: LORENZO (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank God you didn't show up any
dialog: later. This place gives me the chills
dialog: at night. ... No electricity, and all
dialog: these mirrors... You know, I live in
text: Brooklyn near a Jewish neighborhood,
dialog: and when someone dies, they cover all
dialog: the mirrors in their house. Some say
dialog: that it's just to renounce all vanity
dialog: during the mourning period, but others
dialog: say something else... They say it's to
dialog: keep the soul of the dead from being
dialog: trapped in the mirrors... Believe it
dialog: or not, there's always a bit of truth
dialog: in any superstition. Am I right?
text: Amused and skeptical at the same time, Ben contemplates the
dialog: mirrors that surround him-
speaker_heading: LORENZO (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess you just have to keep your
text: eyes away from them.
text: Unlike the rest of the scenery, THE MIRRORS ARE PERFECTLY CLEAN
text: AND GLISTENING.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Did you clean them?
speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: The mirrors, why are they so clean?
dialog: Lorenzo smiles-
speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: That's Gary Lewis, the fellow who
dialog: worked here before you. He was
dialog: completely obsessed with these damn
dialog: mirrors. He'd spend the entire night
text: polishing them.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Why did he leave?
speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: No idea. Just didn't show up one
dialog: night. I take it he's found a better
dialog: opportunity somewhere else.

dialog: bothered to say hello or at least ask
dialog: "how are you doing?"... I mean, damn, do
dialog: we work together as a team or what?!
dialog: You, on the other hand, seem like a
dialog: nice guy. How long has it been since
dialog: you left the NYPD?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Almost a year.
speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: Why did you resign from the force? You
dialog: were a detective, is that correct?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I was wounded during a holdup... It kind
dialog: of changed my perspective on things.
text: Ben and Lorenzo reach the next floor.
speaker_heading: LORENZO
dialog: Third floor... Ladies' department. You
dialog: gotta be careful here. When the wind
text: blows, sometimes the tiles fly off the
dialog: roof and they'll just snap your ear
dialog: off, if you follow what I'm saying...
text: Lorenzo checks the time on his watch.
speaker_heading: LORENZO (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I'll let you get acquainted with
dialog: the rest of the store on your own.
text: They turn around.
speaker_heading: LORENZO (CONT'D)

text: He fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes- Not
dialog: quite an NYPD uniform...
text: Suddenly, his eyes freeze. Intrigued, he comes closer to the
text: mirror and leans forward-
text: A HANDPRINT, BARELY VISIBLE, ON THE ICE COLD SURFACE.
text: He touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it
text: off, unsuccessfully. He picks up a rag from the ground, spits on
text: the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently. The print remains. This
dialog: confirms his hunch-
text: THE HANDPRINT IS INSIDE THE MIRROR...
text: By angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed.
dialog: Another. And yet another-
text: THE ENTIRE MIRROR IS COVERED WITH HANDPRINTS, JUST AS IF A CROWD
text: OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD PRESSED ITSELF AGAINST THE GLASS
dialog: TO GET OUT...
text: As he looks back up in the mirror he sees- THE ACCESS DOOR TO
text: THE BASEMENT OPENING...
text: Ben turns around. His gaze freezes- THE ACCESS DOOR TO THE
dialog: BASEMENT IS CLOSED!
text: YET, IN THE MIRROR, IT CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SCREECH OPEN!
text: Ben swings his head back and forth, between the shut door in
text: reality and the opened door in the mirror. What is happening? Is
dialog: he dreaming or hallucinating?
text: Ben walks backwards towards the basement door, keeping his eyes
text: fixed on the mirror. As he goes to reach for the handle, he sees
text: his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door!
dialog: Ben opens it-
text: THE SYNCHRONICITY BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE ONE REFLECTED
text: IN THE MIRROR HAS BEEN RESTORED. Ben tries to reenact the

text: Along a wall, Ben finds a fuse box and pushes some of the

text: AS BEN DISCOVERS HIS SURROUNDINGS, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY,

scene_heading: 37 EXT. DAY - NEW JERSEY STREET 37
text: It's been snowing all day and a white coat of powder outlines
text: the trees and houses.
text: On the front lawn of their house, 5 year old MICHAEL and 7 year
text: old DAISY are building a snowman.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why did they say on TV that it wasn't
dialog: supposed to snow today, but tomorrow
dialog: instead? Why did they lie?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Sometimes they make mistakes, Michael.
dialog: It happens...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Grown-ups don't make mistakes. Only
dialog: little children do.
text: Slightly annoyed, the little boy places the eyes on the snowman.
text: Daisy's face lights up with a big smile when she catches sight
text: of her father's car approaching-
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Daddy!
text: Michael turns around and sees Ben exiting his 1986 Oldsmobile,
text: with a big wrapped package in his arms.

dialog: (to his daughter)
dialog: Daisy, has Michael been a good boy?
dialog: Does he deserve his birthday present?

speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: No! Yesterday he finished the whole

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Not true!
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Yes it's true!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, thank you. I'll be fine.

dialog: arms.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Happy birthday, Michael.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Duh, open it stupid!
text: Michael tears away the wrapping paper and discovers a remote

scene_heading: 39 - LATER IN THE AFTERNOON - 39
text: Through the front window, we see a Volvo station wagon park in
text: front of the house. Amy gets out of the car, loaded with
text: shopping bags. She enters the house and hands the groceries over
dialog: to Rosa.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Hi Rosa... Where are the kids?
speaker_heading: ROSA
dialog: Upstairs...
dialog: (in a low voice)
dialog: ...With Señor Ben.
text: The expression on Amy's face shifts. Noticeably irritated, she

text: Michael's remote control car drives at full speed down the
text: hallway. Ben shows his children how to operate the remote

scene_heading: 40 INT. EARLY EVENING- BEDROOM HOUSE 40
text: Amy is not equally pleased to see him- She's beside herself with
dialog: anger-
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What is this? I already asked you not
dialog: to drop by without calling, didn't I?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I do, but you never take my calls!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't need your calls in the middle

dialog: them.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I haven't had a drink in three months
dialog: but, then again, how would you know?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't want to know, Ben. I don't

text: Ben moves closer to his ex-wife-
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Just give me another chance.
text: She smiles- How many other chances did she already give him?
text: Behind the firmness and intransigence she conveys, we sense Amy
text: is torn. She still loves him as well.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I need more time, Ben. Listen, I will
dialog: never stop you from seeing your
dialog: children but we have to set up some

text: Out of nowhere, Ben hits the wall with his bare fist-
speaker_heading: BEN

text: BIRTHDAY TODAY! COME ON AMY, WHAT RULE
text: IS GOING TO STOP ME FROM SEEING HIM?
scene_heading: 41 INT. EARLY EVENING - HOUSE BATHROOM 41
text: In the bathtub, Daisy and Michael cannot avoid overhearing their
text: parents arguing. In denial, Michael blocks his ears with his
text: hands and lies back under the water...
scene_heading: 42 BACK IN THE BEDROOM - 42
text: Amy seems distrustful of Ben, scared of how close he is to the
text: edge. We can see the anger in his eyes...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Look at yourself. You're still
dialog: carrying around so much of that anger.
text: He catches a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror- and of the
text: desperate violence in his eyes... Ben steps back.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (trying to calm down)
dialog: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at

text: Through the window, she watches Ben exit the house and get into
dialog: his car.
text: When she turns away, she discovers Michael and Daisy standing

speaker_heading: AMY

dialog: level has continued to rise.
text: The outline of Ben and Lorenzo's silhouettes appear in the
text: staircase leading to the ground floor-
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I haven't managed to find the source
dialog: of the leak. My guess is it doesn't

text: He grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant
dialog: coffee.
text: In the reflection of the clock, we see Ben watching TV. It is
text: past midnight. Ben gets up and grabs his flashlight- It's time
dialog: for his rounds.
scene_heading: 45 INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER CENTRAL HALL 45
text: Through the shattered panes of the central dome, we see Ben
text: walking through the store.
dialog: Since the mysterious occurrences of the night before, his
text: attitude has changed. He avoids, as much as possible, looking
text: into the mirrors. He is on guard, fearing another supernatural
dialog: manifestation.
text: The shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are
text: all disturbing and unsettling.
text: Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble
text: columns seems alive in the dark.
text: As he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his
text: attention. Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror-
text: AT THE FAR END OF THE STORE, ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULL
text: SWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT! EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS, AS IF THE
text: FIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE. CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHING
speaker_heading: HAPPENED.
text: How is this possible? Ben turns around to see the same spot in
text: the real world- ONLY IT'S IN RUINS...
text: Ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror-
text: The vision of the past prevails. Unable to ignore it, Ben
dialog: decides to check it out for himself...
text: Ben wanders off towards the far end of the store, a landscape of
text: dust and desolation. HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR, ON THE OTHER
text: HAND, HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE "FLASHBACK"-
text: We follow him in the mirror-
text: Ben has left the night behind and enters the "daytime"
text: department. Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled.
text: Ben continues his journey into the past.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: 45 CONTINUED: 45
text: The customers jostle one another while shopping during a big

dialog: of clothing.
text: Ben stops dead in his tracks when he notices, around his shoes,
text: a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor-
text: He bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid- GASOLINE.
text: Gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor
dialog: of the department store.
text: Ben turns around and sees, under the shelving, A HAND LIGHTING A
speaker_heading: ZIPPO-
text: The lighter falls to the floor in slow motion.
text: The liquid bursts into flame instantly. THE CHEERFUL VISION OF A
scene_heading: DAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE QUICKLY TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE-
text: EVERYTHING IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE CLOTHES, THE MANNEQUINS
text: AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE CROWD! THE AGONIZING SHRIEKS OF PAIN
text: AND PANIC ARE DEAFENING.
text: Frightened, Ben steps back-
text: The flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has
dialog: rushed to escape death-
text: HORRIFIC VISIONS OF PEOPLE BURNING ALIVE... INCINERATED FLESH.
text: FACES DISTORTED BY THE PAIN, SKIN MELTING TO THE BONE.
text: In the midst of the flames through the heat waves, Ben spots the
dialog: face of the firestarter- IS IT HIS OWN?
text: Ben has no time to react. In a split second, his uniform catches
dialog: fire.
text: Panicked, he attempts to put out the fire with his hands-
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: IN THE DARK NIGHT SURROUNDED BY THE CHARRED RUINS, BEN QUIVERS
text: DELIRIOUSLY AS HE TRIES TO SMOTHER THE INVISIBLE FLAMES.
text: He comes back to reality-
text: Ben catches his breath, trying to come to his senses. What's
dialog: happening to him? What he just experienced certainly felt real.
text: During his panic, the flashlight rolled under one of the
dialog: counters.
text: Ben bends down to pick it up. The beam illuminates the ground
text: and throws light on an object a bit further away- A LEATHER
speaker_heading: WALLET.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: 45 CONTINUED: (2) 45
text: He stretches out his hand to pick it up. The leather is worn-out
text: but the absence of dust establishes that the wallet has landed
text: there recently. Ben examines the object with the experienced
text: touch of a professional accustomed to handling evidence.
text: Between the collection of cards and scraps of paper, Ben finds a
text: driver's license belonging to- GARY LEWIS, 55 years old, a
text: sturdily built African American man. WE RECOGNIZE THE MAN
text: RUNNING IN THE SUBWAY, AT THE BEGINNING. The name rings a bell
dialog: for him-
scene_heading: 46 INT. NIGHT - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER 46
text: Ben returns to the trailer and rummages through the closet-
text: He stops when he finds another uniform. A name is embroidered on
dialog: the shoulder-
scene_heading: AGAIN THE SAME NAME: GARY LEWIS, BEN'S PREDECESSOR, THE MISSING
scene_heading: NIGHT WATCHMAN.
text: The wallet rests on the table and piques Ben's curiosity. He
text: cannot hold back his police instincts.
text: He finally empties out the contents on the table-
text: A Blockbuster card, restaurant receipts, a driver's license,
text: Phillips' business card from Mayflower, cash and a sheet of
dialog: paper folded in four-
text: Ben unfolds the sheet of paper and sees, written in ink-
speaker_heading: ESSEKER
text: Ben chews over these seven letters. Is it somebody's name? A
text: place? A code? Initials? He folds it up again and puts
text: everything back, neatly, in the wallet that he stows away in one
dialog: of the drawers.

speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: The mirrors... In the department

speaker_heading: BEN

text: In the basement, the water level continues to rise.
text: With a flashlight in hand, and his feet submerged in the water,
text: Ben moves deeper into the tunnel.
text: He is searching for the source of the leak. The beam of light
text: sweeps across the walls and the piping.
text: Ben crosses an intersection. In the corner, on the tiled wall,
text: he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of
text: dust and dirt. He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it
text: off, revealing an arrow pointing to, ST JOHN'S DEPARTMENT OF
scene_heading: PSYCHIATRY.
text: He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways.
text: Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall. He comes closer
text: and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold. The
text: humidity has pearled into droplets.
text: He has found the source of the leak.
text: His hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly. Ben
text: digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked
text: water pipe to light. The leakage has damaged the wall in which
text: the tubing was embedded.
text: Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were
text: another room on the other side of the wall.
text: He pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it
text: with his arm. He removes his arm. For a moment, he observes the
text: gaping black hole that he has just left behind.
text: Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot
text: make out what is on the other side.
text: He makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for
dialog: him to crawl through-
text: ON THE OTHER SIDE, HE DISCOVERS A LARGE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE
scene_heading: MIDDLE OF IT ANOTHER ROOM- AN OCTAGONAL ONE WHOSE EACH AND EVERY

dialog: Knock, knock, knock...

text: From his pocket, Ben takes out Gary's driver's license. He shows

speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You picked up this guy yesterday
dialog: morning... I need to take a look at him.
dialog: It's very important.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why do you want to see him?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: He used to work at the Mayflower as a
dialog: night watchman, before I replaced him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Where did you get his driver's
dialog: license?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I found his wallet in the department

dialog: died...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You are no longer a cop, Ben. This
dialog: isn't your business anymore.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: He sent me a package before he died,
dialog: with newspaper articles about the
dialog: Mayflower... I think he was trying to

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (to Ben)
dialog: There you go... There's your answer.
dialog: Your man committed suicide.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You know a lot of people who cut their
dialog: own throats?
speaker_heading: YOUNG DOCTOR
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Well, all I know is that the cops are
dialog: still investigating this one. That's
dialog: why we still have the body. People can
dialog: be very creative when it comes to
dialog: suicide. I'm sure it's not the
dialog: craziest thing you've seen.
text: The young doctor stops in front of the number 58B. He opens the
text: door to the refrigerated compartment bay and pulls out the tray
text: carrying the corpse, wrapped in a white sheet-
speaker_heading: YOUNG DOCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Gary Lewis...
text: He lifts the sheet, revealing Gary Lewis' upper body-
text: Gary's eyes are rolled upwards and his throat is wide open. His
text: skin has become translucent, almost purple. His contorted corpse
text: is frozen in a deadly expression of profound suffering... His
text: flesh has started to decompose and putrefy.
text: Ben stares at the body, in search of a hint, a clue, any useful
dialog: information...
text: Amy becomes impatient.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I've got to get back to work, Ben.
dialog: They're waiting for me upstairs.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: How... What did he slit his throat with?

speaker_heading: YOUNG DOCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Seven years of bad luck.
text: Suddenly, reflected in the stainless-steel door of the
dialog: compartment bay, Ben sees-
text: GARY'S FACE TURN SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM. GARY STARES DIRECTLY AT
text: HIM. WITH A VOICE FROM BEYOND, HE DELIVERS A MESSAGE TO BEN-
speaker_heading: GARY
text: ...ESSSEKERRR...
text: Ben jumps out of his skin and backs away, terrified. Neither Amy
text: nor the doctor saw anything, of course. They gaze at him with a
dialog: puzzled look-
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Are you OK, Ben? What's going on?
text: Ben looks at the corpse and its reflection again- Gary is frozen
text: in the same contorted position, as if nothing ever happened.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (coming to his senses)
dialog: I need to see his files...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
text: Ben raises his voice.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I NEED TO SEE HIS FILES!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Come on, Ben, what is it you're after?
dialog: I am not supposed to show you any
dialog: file... You're not even allowed to be
dialog: here. I could get fired for this.
text: The doctor senses that the conversation is taking on a more
dialog: personal turn.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DOCTOR
dialog: Well, I'll be off. Amy, you know where

text: Amy observes him, perplexed. We sense that she is concerned
text: about Ben's strange behavior and over sensitivity.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Look at this picture... Come and see,
dialog: Amy.
text: He shows her a snapshot taken by the police. We see Gary soaked
text: in his own blood, the throat slit open. The picture is real,

text: several pointy pieces, like a spider web. In his hand, Gary
text: still holds the piece of glass that he used to cut himself.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Look...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What!?
text: Ben points to the reflection in the mirror-
speaker_heading: BEN

dialog: blood...
speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY

text: We sense that she is distraught by Gary's death.
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: ...My Gary hadn't slept at home for
dialog: three weeks. At first I figured he had
dialog: found himself a girlfriend, so I
dialog: didn't worry much about it... It's
dialog: terrible. The policeman told me that

speaker_heading: BEN

dialog: anything unusual in his behavior?
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Oh yes, but that goes way back to when
dialog: he started working at Mayflower.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What kind of changes?
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: He didn't care much for anything
dialog: anymore. Before, we'd sit up and watch
dialog: television together. But once he
dialog: started that job as a night watchman,
dialog: he'd spend all his time-off locked up
dialog: in his room...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Sleeping?
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: He hardly slept anymore... He was way
dialog: too busy!
speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
dialog: No, that don't mean a thing to me...
text: She sets down the picture frame.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: May I see his room?
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS
dialog: Yes, of course. Come, follow me, it's
text: down the hallway, the door at the very
dialog: end.
text: Ben follows Mrs. Lewis to her grandson's room-
text: It looks nothing like the room of a fifty-year-old man, but
text: rather like that of an old teenager. From what we can see, Gary
text: grew up in here, and each object recalls a stage in his life.
text: Everything is clean and in its proper place, it is perfectly
dialog: tidy.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Do you mind if I stay in here for a
dialog: moment?
text: Mrs. Lewis smiles at him. She too, likes to gather her thoughts
text: in Gary's room.
text: Ben scrutinizes the room in search of a clue, a hint that might
text: help him on the Esseker lead. He opens the drawers and looks
dialog: through the papers-
dialog: Nothing is of any help to him. The only place left that he
text: hasn't searched is the walk-in closet, whose half-open doors
dialog: seem to invite him to enter...
text: What Ben discovers inside is beyond anything he could ever have
text: imagined- The closet has been emptied out completely, and
text: MIRRORS COVER EACH AND EVERY WALL, FROM THE FLOOR TO THE
text: CEILING! - It's a miniature replica of the hidden room that Ben
text: discovered back in the basement of the department store...
speaker_heading: MRS. LEWIS

dialog: A terrible sin. Do you know sir in the

scene_heading: 61 INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER 61
text: Night has fallen. The department store is calm and silent.

text: flashlight. Ben must be down there.
text: ALL OF A SUDDEN, A LOUD SHRIEK TEARS THROUGH THE SILENCE. There
text: is a woman, somewhere in the store.
text: Ben runs up to the entrance hall at full speed. The shrieks
text: resound through the department store again. They seem to come
text: from one of the floors above.
text: Without hesitation, Ben dashes up the stairs-
text: He arrives on the second floor and searches through all the
text: departments. Impossible to tell where the cries originate from.
text: He climbs up to the third floor. The beam of the flashlight
text: sweeps past each nook and dark corner-
text: Somewhere in the store, the woman continues to scream and wail
dialog: to death.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: WHERE ARE YOU?!!

dialog: Ma'am? I'm right he...
text: ANOTHER SHRIEK IS EMITTED, RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. He turns around-

text: A BLOODY HAND BURSTS OUT FROM THE LAST ONE, ACCOMPANIED BY
text: ANOTHER PIERCING SCREECH OF PAIN!
text: Ben runs to it, but finds it empty. IN THE REFLECTION OF THE
text: MIRROR, HOWEVER, THE HAND IS STILL STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS HIM!
text: Ben stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it
text: face the last booth, he might be able to see what truly happened
dialog: inside.
text: Ben unhooks the mirror.
text: It is way too heavy and bulky to carry. He lets it slide down
dialog: the wall.
text: Inch by inch, Ben hauls the mirror across the floor.
text: He reaches the last dressing room-
text: Through the reflection in the mirror, he examines the interior
text: of the cubicle.
text: In the dark he catches sight of BARE FEET STAMPING AGAINST THE

dialog: the body...
text: With his eyes fixed on the mirror, Ben walks backward towards

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Listen, so far, his statement is
dialog: pretty consistent with the facts... We
dialog: checked it out, he did place a call

dialog: started noticing the water leakage at
text: around two in the morning. The daytime
dialog: security guard, Lorenzo Sappeli,

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, lately, communication hasn't quite

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: LARRY

scene_heading: 68A - QUEENS APARTMENT - 68A

speaker_heading: 71 CONTINUED: 71

dialog: them-
text: He's exhausted and he's forced to stop.
text: Not a single shard of glass, not even a scratch, the mirrors
text: seem completely indestructible...
text: Ben is not through with them. He drops the chair to the ground
text: and pulls out the gun from his belt.
text: Without a moment's hesitation he opens fire-
text: THE MIRRORS SHATTER VIOLENTLY, CRACKING WITH THE POWERFUL IMPACT
text: OF THE BULLETS. In the spiderweb-cracked mirror, his image is
text: deformed.
text: Having found a weak spot, Ben savors his sweet victory when,
text: suddenly, something inconceivable unfolds before his very eyes-
text: THE BULLET IMPACTS DISSOLVE AS IF BY MAGIC AND THE MIRRORS ARE
speaker_heading: RECONSTITUTED!
text: Ben's shock and disbelief give way to rage. He fires, in a fury,
dialog: emptying the entire clip this time-
text: Again, the bullet holes vanish, leaving Ben alone, face to face
text: with his own reflection. He breaks down nervously-
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Why did you do it? WHY? WHY DID YOU

dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)

text: Each and every mirror in Angela's apartment has been covered

speaker_heading: BEN

dialog: Ok...
text: Ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered

dialog: Gary's investigative research.
dialog: All the articles date back approximately to the same period and
dialog: are all related to the fire that ravaged Mayflower five years

text: But not a hint of Esseker.

text: Ben observes Terrence Berry's face in one of the archive

text: surely he was a good father... Ben can't help but empathize with
dialog: him.
text: As he looks up, Ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the
dialog: window-
dialog: What if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his

text: The phone rings-
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)

text: of the children. A thousand thoughts rush through his head,
text: leaving him in an utter state of confusion. He doesn't know what
dialog: to do nor what to think anymore.
text: Ben reaches for his cell phone and dials Larry's number-
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Hello, Larry? It's me... I'm going to
dialog: need your help again-
speaker_heading: LARRY (O.S.)
dialog: Come on, Ben... For Christ's sake! What
dialog: are you doing?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mayflower used to be a hospital before
dialog: it became a department store. St.
dialog: John's Hospital. Do you have any idea
dialog: where all the medical records could
dialog: have ended up after it closed down?
speaker_heading: LARRY (O.S.)
dialog: How am I supposed to know that?!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Go to the city hall archives... They
dialog: must have something considering it was
text: a public hospital.
speaker_heading: LARRY (O.S.)
dialog: I've got others things to do. I can't
dialog: go to City Hall today. I've -
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Larry, Larry stop it... If I could go
dialog: myself, I wouldn't be asking you. Go
dialog: to the City Hall archives, and ask
dialog: them to look up Esseker among the
dialog: former patients. Please.
speaker_heading: LARRY (O.S.)
dialog: Ben, for god's sake, what are you
dialog: trying to prove?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Please, do it for me.
speaker_heading: LARRY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Talk to you later.
text: Ben hangs up.
text: He glances back at the rear view mirror and sees ANGELA'S
text: CORPSE, SITTING ON THE BACK SEAT!
text: Startled, he loses control of the vehicle. A truck approaches at
text: full speed in the opposite lane. He barely avoids the collision.
text: Two other cars appear. Ben zigzags in and out, just barely
text: avoiding a fatal crash.
text: He stops along the edge of the road.
text: Ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering
text: wheel in an attempt to clear his mind. He looks up into the rear-
dialog: view mirror again-
text: ANGELA'S REFLECTION IS STILL THERE. Behind her long black hair,
text: she fixes him with a milky gaze.
text: Ben flies into a rage. HE SMASHES THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR WITH HIS
text: BARE FIST, REDUCING IT TO SCRAPS...
text: Ben is alone and lost.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: What have I done? I don't
dialog: understand... What have I done?

scene_heading: 83 EXT. NIGHT -MANHATTAN STREET - NYPD POLICE STATION 83
text: Under the pouring rain, the police patrol cars come and go in
text: front of the police station.
text: A bit further away we recognize Ben's Oldsmobile, parked on an
text: adjacent street. Ben is waiting inside.
text: A man approaches, knocks on the car window and enters the
dialog: vehicle. It's LARRY-
text: The rainwater drips down his raincoat. Under his arm he holds a
text: file of documents, wrapped in a plastic bag.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: This ought to make you happy...
dialog: (handing him the file)
dialog: Anna Esseker...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: 83 CONTINUED: 83
text: Ben nervously tears open the plastic wrapping-
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I wasn't quite sure what you needed,
dialog: so I got all of her medical records.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Perfect, Larry. That's perfect.
text: Ben skims through the pages. He cannot believe that he has
dialog: finally discovered who Esseker is...
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Everyone's real edgy up there. You're
dialog: still a fuckin' murder suspect.
dialog: People are wondering why I let you
dialog: out. You have to tell me more. What
dialog: does the history of the Mayflower have
dialog: to do with the death of your sister?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I don't know exactly. I can't tell
dialog: you, but some really fucked up things
dialog: started happening to me when I took
dialog: the job over there. Nothing makes any
dialog: sense to me either but I have to
dialog: follow my instinct.
text: Larry notices the broken rear-view mirror-
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What happened? Did you have an
dialog: accident?
text: Ben is too absorbed in the records. He doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Anna Esseker... Where did you find her
dialog: files? Did you go to City Hall?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: No, you were wrong about that, they
dialog: had nothing. All the medical records
dialog: from St. John's Hospital are still up
text: there with the unclassified cases.
text: Ben squints at him.
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: She was a patient at St. John's in the
text: psych ward run by a Dr. Kane, between
dialog: March and September 1952. She was only
dialog: twelve years old when she died...

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: When the nurses went on their rounds,
dialog: first thing on the morning of October
dialog: 6th, they discovered that all the
dialog: patients had left their rooms during
dialog: the night and gathered in the main
text: room. All of them were dead, including
dialog: the girl. Apparently, they had killed
dialog: one another... A slaughter house... After
dialog: that they shut down the place. Nobody
dialog: ever found out what really happened.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What about the doctor? Dr. Kane?
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: He was arrested. They found him dead

speaker_heading: 85 OMITTED 85
scene_heading: 86 INT. NIGHT - QUEENS APARTMENT 86
text: Angela's apartment is plunged in total darkness-
text: Ben lays Anna Esseker's file on the coffee table and aims the
text: desk lamp at his "research corner" on the wall.
text: He turns the lamp back at the file and sits down to study it.
text: WHY ARE THE MIRRORS ASKING FOR ANNA IF SHE'S ALREADY DEAD? WHY?
text: IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE...
text: On an index card filled in by Anna's parents in September 1952,
text: Ben finds a Pennsylvania home address.
text: Dr. Kane's first diagnosis is irrevocable - "Despite her young
text: age, Anna Esseker suffers from severe schizophrenia, leading to
text: withdrawal from reality, delusional and violent behavior."
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: 86 CONTINUED: 86
text: He shuffles through the first few pages of various
dialog: administrative documents.
text: His eye lands on several photographs of Anna taken at the time
text: she was admitted to the hospital- She is just a child, yet, six
text: male nurses were needed to restrain and immobilize her in front
text: of the photographer. Her face is hardly discernible as she
text: struggles like a wild animal.
text: A high-pitched sound of cracking glass is heard from behind. Ben
dialog: turns around-
text: Another loud crack - It comes from one of the covered mirrors in
dialog: the apartment.
text: Ben rises slowly to his feet and comes closer. He removes the
text: sheet hanging on the frame-
text: A crack has appeared in the upper corner of the mirror. Ben
text: casts his eyes over the reflection. His glance comes to rest on
text: Anna's file laying on the desk-
text: He goes to fetch the photograph of the little girl and presents
dialog: it to the mirror-
text: KRAAAAACK - the crack in the mirror spreads, as if some kind of
text: pressure were applied on the other side of the mirror as a
dialog: reaction to the photograph...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You're still alive, aren't you?
text: All of a sudden, Ben realizes something. He runs back to the
text: file on the table and goes through the documents again, one by
dialog: one.
text: He stops on a carbon copy of a hospital release form and checks
dialog: the date.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You're wrong Larry, you're wrong...
text: His eyes light up-

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Come on, come on... Let's go... Daisy,
dialog: Michael?
text: She passes in front of the children's room and stops- INSIDE,

scene_heading: 88 INT. DAY - CHILDREN'S ROOM 88
text: She opens the door and finds her son squatting in front of the
text: mirror, talking to his own reflection.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What are you doing Michael? Come on,
dialog: we're going to be late.
text: The little boy does as his mother says. He gets up and dashes

text: Amy's glance freezes in horror. Terrified, she almost loses her
dialog: balance-
text: MICHAEL'S REFLECTION IS STILL IN THE MIRROR, SITTING IN A
scene_heading: SQUATTING POSITION!
text: HE LOOKS AT AMY WITH A BIG SMILE.
text: Amy attempts to speak but can't-
text: The mirror image of her son remains silent.
text: Amy steps closer to the mirror and, in the reflection, behind
dialog: the boy, she discovers-

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 89 INT. DAY -QUEENS APARTMENT 89

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We can't stay here, we have to leave
dialog: the house now... We can go to my
dialog: mother's or to a hotel...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Anyplace is gonna have mirrors or
dialog: windows... Anything you can see your
dialog: self in is dangerous. We have to make
dialog: the house safe. The only way is to
dialog: cover all the reflections. If we keep

speaker_heading: CUT TO :
scene_heading: 93 INT. DAY -NEW JERSEY HOUSE - A MOMENT LATER 93
text: Ben has brought up some more paint from the basement. With Amy's
text: help he paints over all the mirrors in the house. In the face of
dialog: this hardship, all the arguments seem far away. We can feel a
text: connection between the two of them.
text: The windowpanes and picture frames have been wrapped securely
text: with newspaper and tape.
text: Every inch of reflective surface in the house, such as the TV-
text: screen and the shiny taps, have been "neutralized" with strips
dialog: of masking tape...

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: BEN

scene_heading: 99 EXT. DAY - COUNTRY ROAD 99

scene_heading: 100 EXT. DAY - ESSEKER FARMHOUSE 100
text: The wind blows over the land.
text: In the winter season, the muddy fields have little to offer to
text: the few starving crows flying over them. A feeling of desolation
text: and solitude hangs over the deserted landscape.
text: Ben's car has left the asphalt road behind, driving through the
text: countryside down a winding dirt road.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: 100 CONTINUED: 100
text: An old farmhouse stands at the very end of the path. If it
text: weren't for the parked pick-up truck and the few piglets running
dialog: wild, one would think that the farmhouse was abandoned.
text: Ben gets out of the car and goes to knock on the door.
text: His shoes sink into the mud. He walks up the steps of the porch
text: and peeks inside the house through the front window. In the dark
text: he discerns the silhouette of a person who is watching TV. He
text: can't help but notice all the mirrors have been covered or
text: turned towards the wall.
text: A big dog barks behind the window. Ben steps back, surprised.
text: The front door opens before Ben has even made his presence
text: known. A young man stares at him in silence.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Hello... Is this the Esseker farmhouse?
text: The young man nods.
text: A woman's voice is heard from inside-
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: What is it Jimmy?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don't know Mom.
dialog: (to Ben)
dialog: What can I do for you sir?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I am looking for Anna, Anna Esseker.

scene_heading: 101 INT. DAY - FARMHOUSE BASEMENT 101
text: We are in the dark basement, under the farmhouse. The door to
text: the first floor opens, letting the light in. Ben appears next to
text: the silhouette of an old man- ROBERT ESSEKER, 80 years old,
dialog: Anna's elder brother.
text: Robert walks down the steps, signaling Ben to follow him-
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You know, up to this day, the visions
dialog: of Anna's fits still haunt me at
dialog: night.
text: They walk through the basement towards an old wooden door.
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: I helped my father fix up this part
dialog: of the basement, especially for her-
text: The old man turns the key in the padlock. Slowly, the door
text: swings open, revealing-
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Her fits were too violent. My mother
text: couldn't take her screams anymore.
text: What's left of a very primitive child's room, SURROUNDED BY
text: DOUBLE WIRE FENCING AND IRON BARS. Rather than a cell, it more
text: resembles a HUMAN-SIZED CAGE, CAPABLE OF RESISTING THE MOST
scene_heading: FEROCIOUS BEAST.
text: As he's talking, images flash on screen- painful memories from
dialog: that time come back to him-
text: Anna being carried to the basement, her innocent eyes full of
text: hate. It's even hard to recognize the face of a little girl. Her
text: howling screams. Her nails digging into her own flesh. Her
text: unnatural strength and the violent thrashing of her arms and
dialog: legs.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: 101 CONTINUED: 101
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: We had every priest, doctor, healer,
dialog: coming from all over the state, one
dialog: after the other. But no one could help
dialog: her.
text: Ben comes closer to the iron bars of the cage. He can see Anna's
text: scratch marks next to the bed, giving his imagination a taste of
text: her plight and suffering.
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
text: Finally, Dr. Kane from New York
dialog: answered my parents' cry for help. He
dialog: rejected the idea of demonic
dialog: possession, said he didn't believe in
dialog: it. He was convinced that Anna
dialog: suffered from a rare form of
dialog: personality disorder. He wanted Anna
dialog: under his care, at St. John's. My
dialog: parents were very poor, but he agreed
dialog: to cover all the hospital costs... In
dialog: less than five months, Dr. Kane had
dialog: cured Anna. It was unbelievable. She
dialog: was her old self again. A real miracle
dialog: of science.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: And after the hospital?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You don't know? She died there with
text: all of Kane's other patients.
text: Ben takes the old release form out of his pocket and shows it to
dialog: Robert.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Anna left the hospital two days before
dialog: the massacre. Kane changed the records
dialog: to make her disappear.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You're not a journalist, are you? What
dialog: do you want?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I want to know. After St. John's,
dialog: where did she go?

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: With Anna?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: No, not with Anna...
text: The old man obviously doesn't want to get into the details. The

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: With the mirrors?
text: Robert stiffens, eyeing Ben with a dark look- How does he know?
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Esseker, tell me where I can find
dialog: your sister. It's very important. It's
dialog: a matter of life and death.
dialog: Robert hesitates -
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Before he died, Kane sent us a letter
dialog: asking us to keep Anna away from
dialog: mirrors and that whatever happens she
dialog: should be in a place where the mirrors
dialog: could never find her.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Where is she now?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: To protect us, she left the house and

scene_heading: 104 INT. DAY - MIDWICH MONASTERY VESTIBULE 104

speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: St. John's closed down in 1952. Who
dialog: are you?
text: Ben sits down. Even at a short distance he cannot discern the
text: face of Anna Esseker, who is now Sister Anna.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: My name is Benjamin Carson. I work as
text: a night watchman at 1229 West 38th
dialog: Street in New York City, what used to
dialog: be St. John's Hospital.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: What is it you want Mr. Carson?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I need your help.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: My help? I don't quite see how I could
dialog: possibly be of any help.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: My wife and children are in danger.
dialog: What is threatening my family is
dialog: asking for you...
text: For a split second, Ben makes eye contact with Anna behind the
dialog: screen. She has understood...
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: If you don't help me I may lose the
dialog: only thing that matters to me.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: I cannot leave the precincts. It's
dialog: impossible.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Tell me why are the mirrors from the
dialog: old hospital so determined to find
dialog: you?
dialog: Sister Anna remains silent-
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I must know, Sister.
speaker_heading: SISTER ANNA
dialog: It is not the wish of the mirrors to
dialog: find me, but of what is imprisoned
text: inside them. The mirrors are merely
dialog: windows on our world...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: 107A CONTINUED: (2) 107A
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: A window... For what? For whom?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: At the time that I was at St. John's,
dialog: Dr. Kane's therapy for personality
dialog: disorders consisted of locking the
text: patient up in a mirrored room for
dialog: several days on end, in order to force
dialog: him to confront his own image. I spent
dialog: the darkest days of my life in that
dialog: room. On the 6th day the nurses found
dialog: me lifeless, almost dead. Since that
dialog: day, I have never had another fit. But
dialog: deep down inside I've always known the
dialog: truth.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What truth?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: There is no cure for schizophrenia, it
dialog: was something else, Mr. Carson. And
dialog: whatever it was, it entered the
dialog: mirror.
text: We can feel the emotion in her voice.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought that after fifty years, this
dialog: would have all gone away. They would
dialog: have disappeared from the mirrors. I
dialog: didn't know.... I'm sorry but if I
dialog: agree to go with you and return to
dialog: that place, I will make it possible
dialog: for them to cross the threshold back
dialog: into the real world.
dialog: Everything is now making sense for Ben-
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It entered with you and they need you
dialog: to get out.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: The consequences of such an act, Mr.
dialog: Carson, would be more devastating than
dialog: letting them suffer where they are
dialog: now. I'm going to pray for you and
dialog: your family. That's all I can do right
dialog: now, Mr. Carson. God bless you...

dialog: died trying to find you. Because they
dialog: failed, their families died too. My
dialog: sister was murdered two days ago... My
dialog: wife and kids will next if you don't
dialog: come with me. Look-
text: From his wallet Ben takes out a wrinkled photograph of Michael,
text: as a baby, in Amy's arms. Daisy stands next to them in the
text: picture. Ben presses the photograph against the grating for Anna
dialog: to look at it.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: My wife and two children. They're all

speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I KNOW YOU ARE SCARED OF GOING BACK
text: THERE. IT'S EASIER TO KEEP HIDING BUT
text: THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYMORE.

text: IN REALITY, NO HAND TOUCHES IT-
text: IT'S MICHAEL'S REFLECTION INSIDE THE SHINY KNOB THAT IS OPENING
speaker_heading: THE DOOR!
text: Inside the bedroom, Amy fell asleep with Daisy in her arms.

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Hello? Ben... Where are you? Did you

speaker_heading: AMY

dialog: Fuck! There is water everywhere...

text: that she's carrying the guilt.
text: She runs the rosary nervously between her fingers and kneels
text: down in front of her bed to pray when-
text: A loud muted sound followed by a sudden wave of agitation is
text: heard outside the cell. Someone has broken into the monastery.
text: She recognizes Ben's voice- Like a mad man, he's looking for her
text: everywhere and threatens the other nuns to show him the way.
text: Anna stands up when Ben bursts into her cell with his gun in his

text: passageways corridors of the department store.
text: Ben and Anna's silhouettes appear, walking down the stairs.
text: Ben turns on his flashlight. The lights along the corridor are
dialog: too weak.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Watch your step, a water pipe has
text: burst, the whole basement is flooded.
text: Ben guides Anna, with her eyes still shut, through the tunnels.
text: The beam of the flashlight sweeps across the walls, and the

text: They pass the junction of the two tunnels and arrive at the
text: demolished wall.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You stay outside...
text: Anna steps over the rubble as she feels her way into the mirror
dialog: room.
text: IN ALL THE MIRRORS IT'S NOT ANNA THE NUN, BUT ANNA THE LITTLE
scene_heading: GIRL THAT WE CAN SEE-
text: When she places her hand against one of the mirrors, cracks

text: Compared to the gloom of the basement in the department store,
text: the second floor of the house seems to be bathed in light.
text: Michael is sitting quietly in front of his room. As Narcissus
text: did, he is observing his reflection, mirrored in the surface of
text: the water that covers the wooden floor.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Michael ?
text: Hypnotized by his mirror image, the little boy does not hear his
dialog: mother's call.
text: Amy appears at the top of the stairs and catches sight of him.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Michael... Michael, look at me... I'm
dialog: right here.
text: Michael doesn't answer. Gently, he caresses his reflection in
text: the surface of the water.
text: Amy comes up to him slowly, determined to pull him away from his
dialog: reflection...
text: She lays her hand on his shoulder.
text: This time Michael reacts and turns towards her.
text: Before he can utter a single word-
text: THE REFLECTION OF THE HAND BECOMES REAL, GRABBING THE CHILD'S
text: WRISTS. MICHAEL'S REFLECTION PULLS HIM THROUGH ITS SURFACE.
text: MICHAEL DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLOOR.
text: Amy throws herself to the ground in an attempt to catch him. Too
text: late, the little boy has been submerged in the thin layer of
text: water covering the floor. MICHAEL HAS BEEN PULLED INTO THE OTHER
text: SIDE OF THE MIRROR!
text: Amy sees her son struggling under the water, as if he were
text: caught under a coat of ice.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)

text: In the mirror room, Anna recites a prayer for strength. IN THE
text: REFLECTION, YOUNG ANNA IS DOING THE SAME...
text: The mirrors around her shake more and more violently-
text: Anna remains with her eyes still shut.
text: Ben sees cracks forming on the walls and the surface of the
text: water at his feet trembling...
scene_heading: 127A INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER 127A
text: SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE STORE AS WELL- ON EACH

scene_heading: ANNA OPENS HER EYES-

text: Anna's eyes freeze- her pupils constrict- thousands of shards

text: like a dozen sharpened daggers.
text: The blow of the explosion causes the walls to tremble.
text: Instinctively, Ben takes shelter behind the wall.

text: resuscitation as she applies rhythmical pressure to his chest.
text: Amy tries not to lose her head, determined to bring her little

dialog: Cardiac massage, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, cardiac massage...
scene_heading: MICHAEL REMAINS UNCONSCIOUS...
scene_heading: 129 INT. NIGHT - MIRROR ROOM / SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS 129
text: IN THE BASEMENT, THE CALM HAS BEEN RESTORED.
text: Ben is still crouching behind the sheltering wall of the mirror
text: room. In the silence, he waits. He must establish beyond a doubt
dialog: that it's all over.
text: He aims his flashlight at the surface of the water-
text: Everything seems to be back to normal. His reflection is
text: deformed by the slight stir of the water, slowly becoming
text: placid.
text: Ben steps over the rubble to enter the mirror room-
text: All the mirrors have been pulverized leaving behind only the
text: metal cage that was holding them in place. The floor is covered
text: with thousands of pieces of mirror floating in the water,
text: shimmering in the shadows.
text: The beam of the flashlight sweeps the room in search of Anna, or
dialog: her dead body-
dialog: Nothing...
text: Ben inspects all the dark corners behind the metal structure -
text: The woman has vanished.
text: He aims his flashlight at the ceiling. The beam of light
text: instantly reveals a dark shape hanging above him-
text: It's her, or at least what is left of her- A POSSESSED,
text: METAMORPHOSED, HUMAN FRAME. SHE IS BARELY RECOGNIZABLE.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: 129 CONTINUED: 129
text: WITH HER EYES ROLLED UPWARD, HER SLASHED FACE AND HER BODY
text: PIERCED BY THE SHARDS OF GLASS, SHE LOOKS LIKE A DEMON, DEPRIVED
text: OF ANY HUMAN TRAITS. THE REAL ANNA DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOMENT
text: SHE OPENED HER EYES AND RELEASED THE FORCES OF THE MIRROR.
text: Ben has no time to react before "Anna" charges at him.
text: He drops his flashlight to the ground, trying to resist her as
text: much as he can.
text: HER WAY OF MOVING IS NO LONGER HUMAN. MORE LIKE A STROBOSCOPIC
text: CONVULSION, HER MOVEMENTS ARE SOMETHING BETWEEN AN ENRAGED BEAST
text: AND THE WORST EPILEPTIC FIT.
text: Ben manages to pin the creature against the wall. "Anna" spits
text: blood in his face.
text: He applies all his strength to immobilize her- the shards of
text: glass dig deeper into the elderly woman's flesh, which only
text: seems to provide her an intense pleasure...
text: "Anna" froths at the mouth. Her speech has become a deep,
text: animalistic, incomprehensible gurgle.
text: In an effortless movement, "Anna" pushes him away.
text: Her demonic strength is ten times his. Ben is merely a puppet, a
text: rag doll that she sends flying into the air, only to crash
text: violently against the brick walls...
text: Blood squirts onto the surface of the water.
text: Ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the
dialog: underground passageways.
text: On the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark. He
dialog: strives to regain consciousness...
text: Ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but-
text: "Anna" appears from the dark and, in a flash, she strikes a
text: backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air.
text: She lifts Ben up and throws him across the room. He rams into
dialog: the wall.
text: With the absence of light in the basement, Ben is defenseless.
text: He cannot see his assailant...
text: Ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards. His hand
text: struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back.
text: Suddenly, under the water, his hand lands on the gun. He grabs
text: it, turns onto his back, and fires point-blank at "Anna".
text: The bullets go flying through her body, but they don't stop her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: 129 CONTINUED: (2) 129
text: Ben is being dragged. He manages to grab hold of one pipe after
text: the other, trying to hold on, but the pipe gives way and breaks
text: off from the wall, LETTING OUT A POWERFUL JET OF GAS.
text: Once again, Ben is sent flying down the tunnel.
text: He struggles to get back on his feet-
text: Apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence
text: surrounds the subterranean passageways.
text: Ben makes out "Anna's" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas
dialog: pipe.
text: With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore-
text: Something in his eyes has shifted. Rage and violence have
text: replaced the terror and dread. He is determined to put an end to
dialog: the creature, no matter what happens.
text: He slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands,
dialog: towards what once was "Anna"...
text: Crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge.
text: Ben takes another step forward with the same determination. The
text: creature thrusts itself against him-
text: THE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. Ben uses all his strength to
text: keep his assailant's jaw at a distance.
text: In a swift movement, Ben turns around AND IMPALES "ANNA" ON THE
text: BROKEN GAS PIPE!
text: IN A GUSH OF BLOOD THE SHARP METAL TIP PIERCES THROUGH HER
speaker_heading: STOMACH BUT-
text: Despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems
text: unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. On
text: the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the
dialog: trap.
text: Ben moves away, keeping an eye on "Anna". He takes his gun and
text: aims it at her. Ben is exhausted. With his arm outstretched, he
text: is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment.
text: The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark.
dialog: Ben stands by-
text: The demon goes through the cloud of gas- Ben fires-
text: THE EXPLOSION IS INSTANTANEOUS. "ANNA" IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES.
text: THE FIRE SPREADS THROUGH THE TUNNELS.
text: Ben throws himself to the ground to avoid the flames.

text: THE WALLS.
scene_heading: THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS ARE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE-
text: Cracks appear everywhere. The brick walls begin to fall apart.
text: A part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor caves in.
text: Ben gets back on his feet and dashes for the stairs.
text: Totally burnt, flesh charred, "Anna" is enraged by her prey's
text: resistance. The blazing demon runs after Ben.
text: Behind them, one after the other, sections of the walls
dialog: collapse.
text: Ben runs as fast as he can.
text: "Anna" is coming closer to him, when suddenly -
text: JUST BEHIND BEN, A SECTION OF THE GROUND FLOOR CAVES IN, BURYING
text: HER UNDER A MASS OF RUBBLE.
text: Ben narrowly escaped the collapse. He reaches the staircase and
text: catches sight of the exit above when suddenly-
text: THE ENTIRE FOUNDATION OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSES OVER HIM.
text: Ben finds himself crushed along the floor and penetrates the

speaker_heading: MIRROR.

text: All of her efforts are in vain. Amy is unable to bring back her

dialog: to accept reality.
text: She finally breaks down, pleading with the sky above...
scene_heading: 129B THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR 129B
text: Lost and floating in this strange and unfamiliar place, Ben

dialog: ruins.
text: ON THE WALLS, ALL THAT REMAINS FROM THE MIRRORS IS THEIR 1920's
speaker_heading: GOLD FRAMES.
text: The floor has completely subsided. It looks like there was just

text: In the middle of the pile of debris, something in the rubble
dialog: begins to move-
scene_heading: A HAND APPEARS. SOMEBODY SURFACES -

scene_heading: 132 EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER 132
