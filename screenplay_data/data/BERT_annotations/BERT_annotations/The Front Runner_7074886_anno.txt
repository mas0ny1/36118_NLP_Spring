speaker_heading: ENGINEER
dialog: That is the new cut.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: We can’t get a clear line.
speaker_heading: PRODUCER
dialog: Are we at full stick?
text: The producer pops her head out to check the dish. We tilt up
text: to see people watching from above as the dish slowly rises.
text: We pan to find the blown-dry reporter. Beyond him is another
text: NEWSMAN, delegates, protestors, cops, etc...
speaker_heading: TV REPORTER
dialog: -- West of the Mississippi River in

speaker_heading: BROADHURST

speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Senator?!
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: We need a paramedic in the suite.
text: Lee gets down on her knees to help, but Hart rears up

speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: Did anyone find out this guy’s

speaker_heading: WYMAN
dialog: Yeah, they found a photo of you in

speaker_heading: MCDANIEL

speaker_heading: WEINBERG
dialog: Have you?
text: We find Hart and Woodward now at the bar sharing whiskeys.
speaker_heading: WOODWARD

speaker_heading: HART
dialog: No one’s got a sense of humor
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: WOODWARD
dialog: Fuck ‘em if they can’t take a joke.
dialog: (beat while he drinks)
dialog: How's Lee doing?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: She needs a rest.
speaker_heading: WOODWARD
dialog: Mondale did you a favor. Reagan's
text: going to crush him.
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17)
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Maybe. Probably.
speaker_heading: WOODWARD
dialog: You'll have an open road in ‘88.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: ‘88... right.
speaker_heading: WOODWARD

speaker_heading: DOLE
dialog: Why don’t we just buy everyone a

speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I'm interested in educating the
dialog: next generation... not entertaining
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: MODERATOR
dialog: This is beginning to sound like a
dialog: campaign debate... Did either of
dialog: you want to announce something?
text: Light laughter and clapping from the audience. Young people

speaker_heading: WEINBERG
dialog: Mr. Billy Shore, what’s the story?
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: It’s not going to happen today,

dialog: These other candidates, they’re all

dialog: we're seeing in the Soviet Union.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: We didn't bankrupt the Soviets.

speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: What is Billy B’s exact position on

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: He’s a Louisiana lobbyist. His

speaker_heading: EMERSON

speaker_heading: KELLY

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: That he was born?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: This isn’t four years ago. He’s up
dialog: by twelve points... People are

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Is the senator comfortable...
dialog: “sharing”?
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: I’ve never met a man more talented
text: at untangling the bullshit of

dialog: What about his marriage?
text: More CHEERS from the TV as Devroy, annoyed now, reaches over
text: and turns the volume OFF. We still SEE, but can’t HEAR Hart.
speaker_heading: KAISER
dialog: I heard she looks the other way.
speaker_heading: BRODER
dialog: Sounds pretty ideal to me.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Sounds like a zipper story.
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: What is the candidate’s position on

speaker_heading: WOODWARD
dialog: He prefers them open.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Bob, weren’t you two roommates at

speaker_heading: WOODWARD
dialog: When Lee kicked him out a few years
text: back, he crashed on my couch.
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: And?
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 18.
speaker_heading: WOODWARD
dialog: And anything that happens on my

speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: AJ says the trail reporters are

speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Mr. Parker. Is that right?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (stepping forward now)
dialog: Just a lot of stories circulating.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Such as?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I heard one when I was in Dallas.
dialog: Someone saw Hart go up to his hotel
dialog: room with this blonde heiress after
text: a fund-raiser.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Hm. When I was on trail, we were
dialog: fucking each other, not writing
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I’m married.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Good luck with that.
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: Should we follow up?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It’s gossip. Do you know how many
dialog: members of congress... I mean, we’d
dialog: have to expel half the senate.
speaker_heading: BRODER
dialog: And you wouldn’t be thrilled with
dialog: who was left.
speaker_heading: DEVROY

speaker_heading: SWEENEY

speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: They call me every day, and they’re

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: As in?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: There’s a ton of interest in the

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: The state of things... I mean...
dialog: Are we talking about, I don’t know,
dialog: whatever their arrangement...?
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Arrangement - Did you really just
dialog: say that out loud?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: People want to know the Harts. They

speaker_heading: DIXON

speaker_heading: HART

speaker_heading: SHORE

speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Billy. If I do a photoshoot,

dialog: (to himself)
dialog: A good forum.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: There will be photographers in

speaker_heading: HART
dialog: And I will be smiling... like some

speaker_heading: PLANE WOMAN
dialog: Excuse me. Mr. Hart? Would you mind
dialog: signing my diary?
text: He reflexively takes the daybook and signs it, then hands it

speaker_heading: PLANE WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Thank you!

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: So, red rocks?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: A little too much?
speaker_heading: ANDREA

text: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 24.
text: A large sign reads - “HART FOR PRESIDENT. NEW IDEAS.” We SEE

text: Hart tries to cut the ribbon twice, but the scissors are too
text: small and dull. He smiles gamely.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Well this isn’t much of an omen!
text: Amid the LAUGHTER, Shore appears to hand Lee a larger pair of
text: scissors, which she hands to Hart.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: To second tries!
text: Raucous LAUGHTER as Hart finally cuts the ribbon.
scene_heading: INT. HART CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - THIRTY MIN LATER
text: Quieter now as Hart moves briskly from cubicle to cubicle,
text: accompanied by Dixon and Shore, meeting the STAFF.
text: We see dozens of young people at desks, folding tables,
text: cubicles -- trying to look busy as they wait eagerly for
text: Senator Hart to say hello to them. As he lets go of a YOUNG
text: WOMAN’s hand, moves on to the next --
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: This is Joe Trippi, Senator. He’s
dialog: handling mail.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Hi Joe.
dialog: (looking at his desk)
dialog: Is that supposed to be a chef?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Huh? Oh.
dialog: (re: a blue figurine)
text: It’s a smurf. Brainy Smurf.
dialog: Actually. See? Glasses.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (taking the smurf)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: And this is Ginny Terzano, part of
dialog: our press team...
text: Hart goes to shake the next hand, absentmindedly pocketing

dialog: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 25.
scene_heading: EXT. RED ROCKS STATE PARK, COLORADO. MIDDAY.
text: Gary, Lee, and the campaign trudge up a dusty hill under the
text: hot sun. The wind WHIPS around them audibly, obscuring some
text: of the dialog, which is rushed and sometimes overlapping.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: (to Stratton)
dialog: Can you run this much cable?
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: We'll use a mult box.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: How much higher are we going?
text: The altitude is brutal on all of them, but the Harts.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Just a little bit further.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
text: The straight down light is going to
dialog: make brutal shadows. I'd like to
text: shade him somehow, for the cameras.
speaker_heading: EMERSON

dialog: Mrs. Hart, are you okay with the

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (fine, smiling back)
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: STRATTON

dialog: How would you react to a tent?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Poorly.
speaker_heading: WILSON

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Was Everest not available?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (to Wilson)
dialog: Huh?
dialog: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 26.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Economy, education, environment.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Are we calling it the three E’s?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (to Wilson)
dialog: Not that. The part before.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I think foreign policy first?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: You forgot ethics.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: So there’s four E's?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Gary’1l need water.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (to Lee)
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You’1l need water.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: (puffing for air)
dialog: We'll have... water.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: (suffering)
dialog: .-. and beer.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: It’s got to be the three E’s.
text: Linguistically.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: So we’re losing one of the E’s?
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Ha, environment, education, or the
dialog: economy. Which one do you suggest?
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Add an E. Who gives a fuck?
dialog: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 27.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (quietly to himself)
dialog: Four fucking E’s.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: Can I get some music? Maybe a high
dialog: school band?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: No band.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: Music is important. It sets a tone.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: (re: the band)
dialog: What are we, opening a Stater
dialog: Brothers?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Where’s Bill?
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: What do you need?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Not you -- Shore.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: He’s Billy, I’m Bill.
text: When they arrive at a small bluff, they find a couple
text: staffers and Irene Kelly already waiting.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (pulling Lee aside)
dialog: Lee, you'll be over here. I think
dialog: you want to wear something dark,
text: maybe a blue. Not black.
text: Stratton takes Hart’s arm, guides him away from Lee.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: Let’s see how the light’1l play.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (reaching for Hart)
dialog: Did you talk to Andrea?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (over the wind)
dialog: Yeah, remind me when we —
dialog: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 28.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: We'll need makeup for that glare.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Can we have a moment?
text: Dixon pulls Hart away a couple steps.
speaker_heading: DIXON (CONT'D)
dialog: Is all of this really necessary?
dialog: Brown Palace has a perfectly fine
dialog: ballroom...
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Dix, You know what brought me to
dialog: Colorado originally?
dialog: (Dixon doesn’t know)
dialog: The railroad. I spent a summer
dialog: hammering railroad ties. Can you
dialog: imagine?
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: I actually can.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: You know the last time a democratic
dialog: president came out of the west?
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Exactly. The west is the future. It
dialog: always has been. And it still is.
text: OFF Hart, hair whipping in the wind, moving back to his
text: podium spot. Dixon watching him amongst the grandeur of the
text: giant rust colored rocks.
text: Lee recedes with her staff as aides bicker over where Hart
text: should stand. Someone mindlessly fixes his hair.
scene_heading: EXT. TROUBLESOME GULCH, COLORADO - DAY
text: Gary and Lee sit for a MAGAZINE PHOTOGRAPHER who is making
text: minor adjustments to lighting as hair and make up people fuss
text: with Hart’s appearance. He’s trying to smile but it’s driving
text: him crazy. The photographer keeps giving instructions... The
dialog: tension builds when we suddenly...
dialog: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 29.
scene_heading: EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN. DAY.
text: SILENCE, except for the sound of the GULLS softly cawing.
text: The sun reflects off the ocean. It’s as peaceful as the last
text: scene was hectic. We linger on the water for several seconds,
text: seeing and hearing no one.
dialog: Then we realize our POV is Hart’s POV.
text: In a a tee-shirt and shorts and dark shades, he leans on the
text: HOTEL BALCONY RAILING and stares out over the ocean. He’s so
text: relaxed, we barely recognize him.
scene_heading: EXT. TURNBERRY ISLE PIER, MIAMI. AFTERNOON.

scene_heading: EXT. ABOARD THE MONKEY BUSINESS. NIGHT.
text: A PARTY AT SEA! It’s LOUD, and Hart and Broadhurst are
text: drinking tequila from tumblers, talking to LYNN ARMANDT,

text: Everyone's drinking, SHOUTING over the music.
speaker_heading: ARMANDT
dialog: A senator?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (laughing, having fun)
dialog: I was. Recently retired.
speaker_heading: ARMANDT
dialog: Wow. Like, in Florida?
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 30.
text: Broadhurst leans into Hart. He points at a couple rich guys
text: across the way, asking if Hart wants to meet them.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Not interested.
text: An attractive 29 year old blonde joins the group. She
text: whispers something in Armandt’s ear. This is DONNA RICE.
text: Rice introduces herself but Hart can barely hear her name.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MONKEY BUSINESS. DAY.
text: The yacht drifts on the open ocean. Music now twinkling in

speaker_heading: PRELAP :
speaker_heading: HART (0.C.)

scene_heading: EXT. RED ROCKS STATE PARK, COLORADO. DAY.
text: For a moment, we see a caravan of reporters hiking up to the
text: press conference as they struggle to breath.
speaker_heading: HART (0.C.)
dialog: Ideas have power. Ideas are what
dialog: governing is all about.
text: TIME CUT - A CAMERAMAN is on his knees in the orange dust, a
text: massively heavy camera slung on his shoulder.
text: We see Parker taking notes. Fielder a couple rows back. Hart
text: stands without podium, framed by the majestic rocks.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT’D)
dialog: We are running for the highest and
dialog: most important office in the land.
text: We find Emerson, Shore and Stratton in a heated discussion.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: It is your job, specifically, to
dialog: convince the senator not to do
dialog: things exactly like this.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: What exactly do you want me to say?
dialog: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 31.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: That he’s going to look like an
dialog: idiot... or worse, kill somebody.
dialog: What the fuck is an axe throwing
dialog: contest anyway?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I believe they call it Timbersport.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: I can look into light weight axes.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Like, for children?
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Roosevelt was an outdoorsman. He
dialog: killed a grizzly once.
dialog: (aside)
dialog: You know that’s where teddy bears
dialog: came from?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Fuck off.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: He’s correct.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: It’s true. Teddy Roosevelt killed a
dialog: giant bear and they commemorated it
dialog: by making plush toys for children.
dialog: It was a national sensation.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: Maybe he'd settle for log rolling?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: How will they commemorate Gary Hart
dialog: impaling a lumberjack?
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Might play well with the far left.
scene_heading: INT. HART CAMPAIGN PLANE. 90 MINUTES LATER.
dialog: No one obeys the traditional rules of flying. People mill
text: around seats and stand in the aisle and perform interviews.
text: Meanwhile, Hart, chin in hand, alone, staring out the window.
text: Nearby, Ann McDaniel is working Sweeney for time with Hart.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 32.
speaker_heading: MCDANIEL
text: Sure looks overjoyed to be going
dialog: home after thirty years.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: (swigging beer)
dialog: The Senator has very fond memories
text: of Kansas. He cannot wait.
speaker_heading: MCDANIEL
dialog: No one has fond memories of Kansas.
text: We find Dixon, Germond, Broder and Wyman playing cards. We’re
text: watching them from behind the economy curtain. In the BACK
text: with most of the REPORTERS. Parker watches carefully.
text: An ORANGE enters foreground. A Sharpie scrawls a message on
text: the peel. After a big windup, Weinberg rolls the orange up
text: the aisle of the plane. It disappears into the front cabin.
text: A few REPORTERS cheer in their seats. We notice TOM FIEDLER,
text: early 30s and nerdy, among them. He feels on the outside.
speaker_heading: FIELDER
dialog: What’d you write on it?
speaker_heading: WEINBERG
dialog: I asked where the goddamn food is.
speaker_heading: SHANAHAN
dialog: Good. I’m starving. What do they
dialog: have in Kansas? Hardys?
speaker_heading: WEINBERG
dialog: Arbys.
text: Parker looks up to first class. He sees Germond, Broder and
text: Wyman leaving the front section and heading back.
text: Billy picks up the ORANGE. Shows it to Hart. He smiles.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Remember this time last year? Our
text: bus had a flat outside Dubuque.
text: Parker is watching Hart chuckle in response, when Sweeney
text: arrives at his seat.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: We've got a few minutes now if
dialog: you're ready.
text: Parker practically hops out of his seat.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 33.
speaker_heading: WEINBERG
dialog: Go get’em tiger.
text: FIEDLER NOTICES and pulls Sweeney into the galley.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Hey, when can I get some face time
dialog: with the Senator?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: We'll do a presser in Kansas.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: I mean one on one.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: We’re not doing that this time.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: (motions to Parker)
dialog: What do you call that?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: The Washington Post.
text: Sweeney keeps moving as Fiedler takes this in.
text: Just then Weinberg notices the orange a few feet away,
text: tumbling back down the aisle. He reaches out and grabs it.
text: We see the words written on the orange in all caps: “HAVE AN
scene_heading: ORANGE. - GARY.”
scene_heading: INT. HART CAMPAIGN PLANE. FIVE MINUTES LATER.
text: Off the flipping of a NOTEPAD, we find Hart and Parker facing
text: each other in the front, with Sweeney watching carefully.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: But you think the president hasn't
dialog: gone far enough?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I know he hasn’t. I know Gorbachev
dialog: too, don’t forget.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: What can we do? Aside from
dialog: negotiate more reductions.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 34.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: There won't be any peace dividend
dialog: if we don’t meet Gorbachev more
dialog: than halfway. I'd invite him to my
dialog: inauguration.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (doubtful)
dialog: The Soviet premier.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Sure. Why wouldn’t he come? Why
dialog: wouldn't we show him democracy in
dialog: action? We need to be bolder.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You really think that might lay the
dialog: groundwork for more negotiations?
speaker_heading: HART
text: Groundwork? The groundwork is laid.
text: A BUMP OF TURBULENCE rocks the cabin for a moment. Gary
text: casually catches his drink. Parker grabs his armrests.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: (calming)
dialog: It’s just wind.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Yeah, uh huh.
text: A few more bumps. Parker doesn’t love it.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Close your eyes.
dialog: (off Parker’s reluctance)
dialog: Seriously.
text: Parker finally shuts his eyes.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
text: We're driving down a country road.
text: The cabin jostles again.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: See. We hit a few bumps. Truck
dialog: keeps going. You’ve been doing this
dialog: your whole life. Some roads aren't
dialog: paved. That’s all.
text: The plane settles. Parker opens his eyes.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 35.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: You got it... So the Soviets are in
dialog: an economic tailspin, but change
dialog: has to be managed. Otherwise you'll
dialog: get a power vacuum, in Asia and the
dialog: MidEast. You know what fills
dialog: vacuums?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Human nature?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Exactly. Wars. Dictators. Religious
dialog: extremism.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: That's your view of human nature?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Didn't they teach you Tolstoy at..?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Yale. I was a history major.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (rummaging for a book)
dialog: Here.
text: (hands him a worn copy of
dialog: Resurrection)
dialog: It’'ll teach you something about the
dialog: Soviets, too.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Thank you. I’1ll get it back to you.
speaker_heading: HART

text: warms up the keys.
scene_heading: INT. OTTAWA UNIVERSITY CHAPEL, OTTAWA - DAY
text: Hart is midway through an ordinary policy speech for a large
text: group of locals who are listening, but not very engaged.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: As we move toward the end of this
dialog: long, dark chapter in our history,
dialog: new challenges lie ahead...
text: Dixon, Wilson, and Shore speak quietly in the wings.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: We flew to Ottawa fucking Kansas to
dialog: give a policy speech? He’s supposed
dialog: to be getting personal.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Personal is not a comfort zone.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: If it’s any consolation, He is
text: hitting all of the four E’s.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: We added an E?
scene_heading: EXT. HART CHILDHOOD HOME, OTTAWA. DAY.
text: Hart and Lee, surrounded by a PACK OF REPORTERS, stand in
text: front of a rickety clapboard house.
text: ROADWORK is being done across the street.
speaker_heading: MCDANIEL
dialog: How does it feel to be back home?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: We...uh... We actually lived in six
dialog: different houses. My dad, he was
dialog: out of work a lot.
text: The campaign team just hangs back. Quietly stewing.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 37.
speaker_heading: DIXON SHORE
dialog: (quietly) I know, I know.
dialog: Christ, just say it’s good to
dialog: be home.
text: Hart kind of notices his guys grumbling. Lee brightens.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (prompting)
dialog: Remember George used to sit out
dialog: here all day?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Of course... Whenever I got home,
dialog: my granddad would always be sitting
text: here on the front porch with a
text: Bible open in his lap. Every day.
text: One time a neighbor asks him, just
dialog: to be friendly, “What are you doing
dialog: up there?” Grandad says, “Cramming
dialog: for finals.”
text: Lee and the reporters laugh. More photos. Hart turns and
text: gives a reluctant smile.
scene_heading: INT. ECONOLINE VAN - OTTAWA, KANSAS - NIGHT
text: AN ELDER WOMAN VOLUNTEER drives the team. They seem to have
text: lost their way and the staff is AUDIBLY UPSET.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: (prickishly clarifying)
dialog: You've been to the airport before.
speaker_heading: ELDER VOLUNTEER
dialog: Yes, just never in a van.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Where did we find her?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Are we going to swing through the
dialog: South or not?
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Why waste the money?
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: (to the volunteer)
dialog: How would you get there in a car?
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 38.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (found a map)
dialog: We can turn right on the farm road.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: State directors in Georgia and
dialog: Alabama are begging.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: That was the farm road.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Carter won the South.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Carter was the South. Trust me,
text: it’s already gone.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Irene’s right. I’m not writing off
dialog: the South.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: I can give you the numbers.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I intend to be the president of the
dialog: entire country. Not 35 states. If
dialog: my ideas make sense in Youngstown,
dialog: they’1l make sense in Mobile.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: And we get to go to Alabama.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: (re: volunteer driver)
dialog: Dear God, she ran a green.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL, TOPEKA, KANSAS - NIGHT
text: They've arrived at the AIRPORT. Everyone exits in a hurry.
text: Hart puts his hand on the ELDERLY VOLUNTEER’s shoulder. He
text: gives her a smile and she immediately relaxes.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL, TOPEKA, KANSAS - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: STAFF and REPORTERS buzz around the terminal. WEINBERG,
text: SHANAHAN, and a STRINGER read off stories into PAYPHONES.
text: Hart sits between Sweeney and Shore, tinkering with a first-
dialog: generation, shoe-size cellphone.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 39.
text: Stratton approaches the press corps in the background.
speaker_heading: STRATTON (0.S.)
dialog: It’s a 30-minute delay, guys. Go
dialog: get a sandwich.
text: Stratton walks back towards Wilson and Emerson.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: It’s a travesty.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: A designer suit?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: It’s not about the suit. It’s the
dialog: presentation of things.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: What’s this?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Ralph Lauren announced they’re
dialog: doing wardrobe for CBS News.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: You prefer Hugo Boss?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: There’s that word - Wardrobe. Like
dialog: they’re on Three's Company
speaker_heading: STRATTON
text: It is a television show.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: No, it’s the news... A bad suit
dialog: should mean something. It’s
dialog: trustworthy.
text: We see Hart hits a key on the phone and holds it up.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Why isn’t it ringing?
speaker_heading: SHORE SWEENEY
dialog: Did you hit send? Do you see any bars?
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: (holding out his hand)
dialog: You have to hit send. I’1l do it.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 40.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Keep it. I’1l be back.
text: Back to Emerson... Getting more heated.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
text: It starts with designer clothes.
dialog: And everyone says - Don’t they look
dialog: nice - Pretty soon Vidal Sassoon is
text: doing Tom Brokow’s hair.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: (poking the bear)
dialog: Maybe some music.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Sure, Mark Knopfler’s writing some
text: opening theme song and they‘1l have
text: action shots of the anchors leaping
text: away from fires and pulling kittens
text: out of storm drains.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: Hey, maybe they don’t even need to
dialog: read the news...
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Fuck, why have newsmen at all...?
dialog: Let’s just hire models and teach
dialog: them to read. You know, someone you
dialog: can really jerk off to.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (genuinely amused)
dialog: That’s funny.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: It’s not Doug. It’s not funny at
dialog: all. It’s the Death Nail of
dialog: journalism.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Do you mean Death Knell? It’s a
dialog: common mistake.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: How often do people just punch you
dialog: in the face?
text: We find Parker grabbing a coke from a vending machine.
text: Something catches his eye. He stares a moment, curiously.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 41.
text: CUT TO Sweeney, still in his seat, clocking the same thing
text: Parker's looking at: Hart crammed into a phone booth, head
text: down, talking quietly with a big grin.
text: Parker and Sweeney make eye contact, and then a GATE
text: ANNOUNCEMENT draws their curiosity away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THWACK! An ax lands solidly in a wooden BULLSEYE.
scene_heading: EXT. NORTH COUNTRY, NEW HAMPSHIRE. DAY.
text: Two strong hands yank the ax out of the log.
text: A burly LUMBERJACK hands the LARGE AXE to Hart, who wears a
text: flannel shirt and jeans.
text: The crowd whispers in anticipation.
text: Quick shot of a gaggle of reporters, Parker among them,
text: snickering skeptically. Fiedler, from the Miami Herald, lifts
text: a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL towards Parker.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
text: Ten bucks says he misses.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I’m alright, thanks.
dialog: Fiedler shrugs. Suit yourself.
text: Quick POP of Sweeney, head in hands.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: This is a first... He might just
dialog: actually throw away his campaign. I
dialog: can’t fucking watch this.
text: Shore, munching on an apple, looks on with detachment.
text: Hart, smiling, lifts the ax over his head and hurls with all
text: his might. It travels 25 feet and - THWACK! A dead bulls-eye.
text: Even the reporters CHEER as Hart lifts his arms above his
text: head and grins triumphantly.
text: Parker gives Fiedler a little nod. Shore looks at Emerson.
speaker_heading: EMERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: (euphoric)
dialog: That was incredible.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 42.
text: Gary starts working his way through a line of WOODSMEN, eager
text: to shake his hand, particularly after that throw. However,
dialog: there’s a few dissenters including one particularly ANGRY
text: WOODSMAN who keeps his hands in his pockets.
speaker_heading: ANGRY WOODSMAN
dialog: (passive aggressive)
dialog: Just keep your hand out of my
dialog: pocket.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: ANGRY WOODSMAN
dialog: Taxes are high enough. Keep your
text: hand out of my pocket.
text: The woodsman begins to walk away. Hart kind of smiles...
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: So, are we going to talk or are you
dialog: just going to walk away?
text: The woodsman turns back. Caught off guard and a little
text: sheepish. Hart is unflinching.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s a good place to get a beer
dialog: around here?
speaker_heading: OMITTED
scene_heading: INT. HUNTING LODGE - DAY
text: Rifles on racks. Timbersport pros and hunters have formed a
text: horseshoe around Hart in the smoky hall. It’s quiet. No one
dialog: knows where to start.
text: Hart sees the angry woodsman from earlier. He rolls back his
text: sleeves, shows his hands, and smiles.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Your pockets are safe.
text: Chuckles around the room.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: So, where should we start?
dialog: Note: in this scene, questions will come from the crowd. We
text: won’t see each person talk. The group is speaking as a whole.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 43.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 1
dialog: What are we supposed to ask?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Let’s talk about anything you want.
text: We find the campaign team on the side visibly nervous.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 2
dialog: Where’s the beef?!
text: Chuckles around.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Haven't heard that one in a while.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 3
dialog: You a Christian?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Yes I am.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 3
dialog: You think they should have prayer
dialog: in school?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I like prayer in church.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 4
dialog: Do you hunt?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Not so much. When I was a kid, my
dialog: uncle taught me to track bears.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 5
dialog: You going to take our guns?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: You going to take mine?
text: This calms the room a bit for a beat.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 4
dialog: What about Mexicans?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: What about them?
speaker_heading: HUNTER 5
dialog: They're taking our jobs.
dialog: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 44,
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (thinks for a moment)
dialog: You think they want to leave their
dialog: lives behind? Their families?
dialog: (stops)
dialog: Would you?
speaker_heading: HUNTER 3
dialog: They’11l work for nothing.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: That's why we need to invest in
dialog: Mexico.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 2
dialog: You want to buy a jalapeno farm?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Is that what you do? You’re a
dialog: farmer?
speaker_heading: HUNTER 2
dialog: I make chairs.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (riffing)
dialog: So why don’t we invest in their
dialog: enterprise? Their industry. Create
dialog: opportunity for Mexicans in Mexico.
dialog: Instead of stealing your jobs,
dialog: they’1l buy your chairs.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 5
dialog: They're not very good chairs.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Well, I can’t help him with that.
dialog: (a thought)
dialog: I mean, forget jobs for a second,
dialog: think about security. You really
dialog: want a chaotic nation on the brink
dialog: of economic collapse just south of
dialog: the border?
speaker_heading: HUNTER 2
dialog: Sounds like Massachusetts.
dialog: Real laughter.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 4
dialog: So you anti-military or something?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Why do you say that?
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 45.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 4
dialog: You're a democrat.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: I’m in the military.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 5
dialog: What branch?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Navy reserve.
text: A couple chuckles.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: Does that not count?
speaker_heading: HUNTER 4
dialog: You want to cut the military?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I want to reform it.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 3
dialog: That means cut it.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I disagree. I actually wrote an
dialog: entire book on military reform.
dialog: Sold twelve copies. I don’t suppose
dialog: anyone here read it?
dialog: (looks to his staff)
dialog: Any of you guys?
text: Sheepish looks amongst his team. Wilson raises his hand.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It’s a good read.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: You say you’re worried about your
dialog: taxes. You know how much that new
dialog: B2 Bomber costs? About a billion
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 5
dialog: Worth every penny.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Is it? Sure, they might look pretty
text: flying over the Superbowl.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 46.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: But let’s face it, we're building a
dialog: military that’s only good at
dialog: bombing. And after twenty years of
dialog: bombing, you know what we’ll be
dialog: left with?
text: He looks around the room, genuinely open for an answer.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: Rubble. Rubble that we’ll need to
dialog: rebuild. And people who hate us.
dialog: But we won’t have a conventional
dialog: military ready to fight in the
dialog: jungles and deserts where they hate
dialog: us the most.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 1
dialog: Nuke ‘em.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Okay. Sure. Who you going to nuke?
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: The cold war is over and our
dialog: addiction to oil is going to take
dialog: us into battles we don’t know how
dialog: to fight in places like the middle
dialog: east, where stateless Islamic
dialog: terrorism will become an epidemic.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 4
dialog: I’m not worried about some ragheads
dialog: in the desert...
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: You should be. Their bombs won’t
dialog: have a return address.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 1
dialog: Celtics or Lakers?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Nuggets.
text: Boos rain down from all the men.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT’D)
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I’m not afraid of being booed.
text: More laughter. There’s an awkward pause. Feels like they’re
text: running out of questions.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 47.
speaker_heading: HUNTER 6
dialog: If you get elected, are you ever
dialog: going to come back to this town.
dialog: 
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: What do you mean “if”?
text: He smiles. The men laugh. The room has been defused.
scene_heading: INT. BAR AT THE WAYFARER INN, MANCHESTER, NH. NIGHT.
text: Hart gets up from a table of the old guard reporters. They’re
text: laughing about the day’s events.
text: The CAMPAIGN TEAM is at a table, talking about the next stop.
text: Hart heads for the bathroom when he stops at the KIDS TABLE.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: What’s the news, guys?
speaker_heading: PARKER
text: Cuomo is officially out.
text: The young reporters watch Hart’s face waiting for a reaction.
text: Hart has a small smile, then catches himself.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Long way to go.
speaker_heading: MCDANIEL
dialog: Kennedy, Bradley... All out.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I like Gephardt. Al’s still in this
dialog: thing. Jesse Jackson.
speaker_heading: SHANAHAN
dialog: Come on... I mean, Senator, sir.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: He’s got double digits.
speaker_heading: SHANAHAN
dialog: You think this country will elect
dialog: Jesse Jackson president?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Maybe vice president.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 48.
speaker_heading: MCDANIEL
dialog: That’s what Jesse really wants
dialog: anyway, right?
text: Hart smiles just as a waitress arrives.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: They need another round. On me.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You can’t do that. It’s...
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Fine, another round on them.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Word is you're going to be
dialog: president.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I don’t know, how does secretary of
dialog: the navy sound?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Already been a secretary, honey.
dialog: But you’re sweet.
scene_heading: INT. WAYFARER INN. MOMENTS LATER.
text: Hart follows a sign to the RESTROOM. He’s smiling about the
text: Cuomo news. He turns the corner and stops, flustered.
text: Weinberg and a woman reporter from the pool are leaned up
text: against a wall, giggling and making out. Both wear WEDDING
text: RINGS they did not exchange with each other.
text: Hart kind of smiles and quietly enters the mens room.
scene_heading: INT. MIAMI HERALD CONFERENCE ROOM. MORNING.
text: About a dozen editors and reporters sit and stand around a
text: long conference table, among them FIEDLER from the pool.
text: BOB MARTINDALE, the paper’s editor, sits at the head of the
text: table. Another editor, JOE SAVAGE, sits nearby. An
text: investigative reporter named MURPHY is dramatically
text: recounting the movements of a drug cartel.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: They fly in below the radar,

speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 49.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Right before they breach our
dialog: airspace, they dump the whole
dialog: fucking shipment into the Atlantic -
dialog: not pounds... tons of coke. A
dialog: Volkswagon of coke - where they’ve
dialog: got cigarette boats that kick the
dialog: shit out of our coast guard.
speaker_heading: SAVAGE
dialog: You saw this?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Got an old Navy buddy. Runs fishing
dialog: tours out of Islamorada. Spent five
text: nights under a cargo net.
speaker_heading: MARTINDALE
dialog: Nice. Let’s work up some sort of
dialog: map that shows the route and make
dialog: sure we’ve got artwork on those
text: cigarette boats in motion. Not some
dialog: bullshit stock photo, but really
text: kicking up surf.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT EDITOR
dialog: (dry)
dialog: Got it. Sexy boats kicking up surf.
speaker_heading: MARTINDALE
dialog: Anything from the Mickey Desk?
speaker_heading: SAVAGE
dialog: MGM is suing Disney World over the
dialog: new park. It’s a license violation.
speaker_heading: MARTINDALE
dialog: No shit. Could it scuttle the deal?
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT EDITOR
text: Tim’s trying to nail it down.
speaker_heading: MARTINDALE
dialog: Let’s get a top for front page.
dialog: Maybe some options on a crying
text: Mickey drawing.
speaker_heading: SAVAGE
dialog: We've done crying Mickey. Twice.
dialog: When Universal came to Orlando and
dialog: when that alligator ate that kid
dialog: near Epcot.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 50.
speaker_heading: MARTINDALE
dialog: Right. Try Mickey in hand cuffs.
dialog: Politics?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Yeah, just got back from the

speaker_heading: MARTINDALE
dialog: (to Fiedler)
dialog: Okay. Anything new there?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER

speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: MARTINDALE
dialog: (moving on)
dialog: Sports. Who the Dolphins drafting?
scene_heading: INT. MIAMI HERALD NEWSROOM. MONDAY NIGHT, APRIL 27.
text: Fiedler, reading through clips, has his feet up on his desk
text: in the mostly deserted newsroom.
text: Baseball on the transistor radio. The desk phone rings. He
text: picks up. We don’t see the face of the coy, yet tipsy, Dana
text: Weems on the other side of the call.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Tom Fiedler - - - Hello?
speaker_heading: WEEMS (0.S.)

speaker_heading: FIEDLER

speaker_heading: WEEMS (0.S.)

scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: EXT. PHONE BOTH - NIGHT
text: We’re on a street corner. The phone booth is fogged. Inside

speaker_heading: WEEMS
text: She's sneaking around with him.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: (doesn’t buy it)
dialog: Okay, right and how do you know?
speaker_heading: WEEMS
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: I mean, it’s all she talks about.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: What’s her name? What’s your name?
speaker_heading: WEEMS
dialog: (giggling again)
dialog: I can’t tell you that!
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Look, this isn’t funny, OK? You
dialog: can’t just call people and make
dialog: allegations. Now, who are you and --
speaker_heading: WEEMS
text: She's flying up there. To see him
dialog: in Washington. This weekend.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: This weekend?
speaker_heading: WEEMS
dialog: Friday, yeah. Maybe you can follow
dialog: her or something. God, she’s so
text: pathetic. Like a cheerleader
dialog: getting notes from the popular boy,

text: COMMERCIAL: Gary Hart amongst nature. Speaking to camera.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: ... Now over the next year, you’re
dialog: going to see a lot of campaign ads.
dialog: Many of which will have some kind
text: of faceless announcer. But not from
dialog: me. I believe a candidate should
dialog: stand by what they believe in
dialog: rather than hide behind some
dialog: stranger's voice. So, next time you
dialog: hear that faceless announcer making
dialog: claims and accusations, ask
dialog: yourself why.
text: As the HART ‘88 LOGO comes up we find Stratton and Wilson.
text: They're admiring all the HOLLYWOOD PHOTOS at Emerson's desk.
text: In them, Emerson hangs out with 1980’s icons like Nicholson,
dialog: Beatty, Hunter S. Thompson, Don Johnson.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: Must be hard to be away from all

speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Yeah, okay, I ran the California

speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson?
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 53.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: «+. Yes. They’re both Angelinos.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: On those particularly tough nights,
dialog: it must be reassuring to look over
text: and see their faces.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Do they serve as a reminder of the
dialog: regional struggles in California?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Warren Beatty is a thoughtful...
dialog: political... Fuck both of you.
text: We find Hart in the front corner, feet up on Sweeney’s desk,

speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Well thank you. I mean it, Ed.
text: (listens but glances away)
dialog: Well we will, and Lee and I

speaker_heading: SHORE

text: He stares at the sheet. Fiedler’s brain clicks. He starts

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Hey, what’s doing?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: I think I need your help on
dialog: something.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPAIGN BUS - DAY
text: Stratton is attempting to demonstrate the best way to cook a

text: ball of lined paper as a BURGER.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I know how to make a burger, Mike.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: If they see you flip it twice...
text: Others from the team chime in.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (dicking around)
dialog: What else will he flip on...
dialog: healthcare... farming subsidies...?
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: I’m serious.

scene_heading: INT. TRUCK STOP, NORTHEAST - DAY
text: Hart in an apron, poses with the RESTAURANT STAFF for a few
text: photos. He flips burgers. Parker watches from nearby.
text: Moments later, Hart is at a table facing Parker. A tape
text: recorder sits between them on the table.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (to Parker)
dialog: We almost done?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Just about.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: You read the book yet?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Just about. It’s Tolstoy.
text: Parker looks down at his notepad. A series of questions have
text: been crossed off. One word remains - “Marriage”.
speaker_heading: PARKER (CONT'D)
dialog: (visibly uncomfortable)
dialog: Can we talk about your separation.
text: Sweeney looks up.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: It’s a fairly common occurrence.
dialog: I'd avoid it if you can.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I’m not having fun asking about
dialog: this. In case you were wondering.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I wasn’t.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY PARKER
dialog: AJ... Look --
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: Why should anyone care? How is it
dialog: relevant?
speaker_heading: PARKER SWEENEY
dialog: People feel like it’s hard to Senator...
dialog: know you. I’m trying to help
dialog: elucidate --
dialog: Some of us
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 56.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: People. Who are these ‘people’
dialog: everyone keeps telling me about?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Fine, maybe we feel that way.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: So, reporters.
speaker_heading: PARKER SWEENEY
dialog: . AJ, either ask something
dialog: else...
speaker_heading: HART (CONT’D)
dialog: Some of you who were in high school
dialog: when I ran McGovern’s campaign.
dialog: It’s not my fault you’re just
text: arriving at the party.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: OK, so around that time, you told
dialog: Gail Sheehy you believed in “reform
dialog: marriage.” What did that mean?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: For crying out loud. I was young
dialog: and tired and living across the
dialog: country from my wife, and I made a
dialog: stupid joke. You know, this is why
dialog: people don’t want to be in public
dialog: life. Because someone will dredge
dialog: up something you said in a moment
dialog: 15 years ago and act like it
dialog: somehow encapsulates your life.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: It’s just --
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I’m going to answer one more of
dialog: these, and then I’m not going to
dialog: sit here anymore. We’ve covered all
dialog: the stuff that matters. Did anyone
dialog: ask Reagan about his marriage?
speaker_heading: PARKER SWEENEY
dialog: I don’t think -- Let’s wrap this up...
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you ask Carter these questions?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: There’ve been rumors --
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 57.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Oh for God sake, AJ. Ask whatever
dialog: it is you came here to ask.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: OK. Do you think you have... A
dialog: traditional marriage?
speaker_heading: HART SWEENEY
dialog: (disbelief) OK. That’s enough. We’re done
dialog: A trad -- here--
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: You want to know what I’m doing in
dialog: my spare time? Is that it, AJ?
dialog: Follow me around then. Put a tail
dialog: on me. I mean it. You'd be very
dialog: bored.

scene_heading: INT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. FRIDAY AFTERNOON.
text: We're watching the ESCALATORS, over the shoulders of Fiedler
text: and Murphy. Mostly tourists and businessmen. Fiedler is
text: flipping through a magazine nervously. He’s so nervous, it’s
text: comical. Murphy is trying to keep it cool.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Just calm down.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: What am I supposed to do?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Act bored. Most people usually look
dialog: bored. What does she look like?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Attractive. Hot enough to make you
dialog: leave your wife.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Honestly wouldn’t take much.
text: Murphy looks ready to give up and then they see her. DONNA.
text: Armandt walks alongside her. Without saying a word, they

scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 58.
scene_heading: INT. BOEING 737 TO DC - EVENING
text: Fiedler and Murphy sit deep in coach. Fiedler leans into the

text: down. He leans a little further and is suddenly hit by the
text: BEVERAGE CART, making a bit of a mess. He flinches back.
scene_heading: INT. NATIONAL AIRPORT TERMINAL, DC - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. NATIONAL AIRPORT TAXI LINE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Do we know where they’re going?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: I fucking hope so.
scene_heading: EXT. HART’S TOWNHOUSE, CAPITOL HILL. FRIDAY NIGHT.
text: Fiedler’s TAXI comes up on a stately, two-story row house.
text: Lights shine in the windows and illuminate the sidewalk.
text: No one’s visible inside or out.
text: Fiedler and Murphy fight for the driver’s side window.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: This one here on the left.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: You want me to pull over?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Just hang a second.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: No security? Nothing? You sure this

speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: It’s his place.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 59.
speaker_heading: MCGEE CAB DRIVER
dialog: (looking at the house) You guys getting out?
dialog: Doesn't feel right.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Just give us a second.
text: Fiedler looks at the windows, hoping for an answer.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: No secret service?

speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Look, I’m not sure what you guys
dialog: are up to...
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (to Fiedler)
dialog: I think you got taken buddy.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: We've been here all of two fucking
dialog: seconds...
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: This isn’t a peep show, one of you
dialog: has to pay me...!
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: New destination, we need a hotel...
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Hold on!
text: Suddenly, the lights turn off inside the house.
text: Fiedler and Murphy go silent.
speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Which one of you is going to...?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Pull over there.
text: The cab pulls over. Inside, they all hold still, waiting to
dialog: see what will happen next.
text: We SEE the front door open. A man’s arm holds it open.
text: Hart and Donna come out onto the stoop.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 60.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Fuck me.
text: Broadhurst and Armandt follow. They walk down to Hart’s

text: BACK TO Fiedler, suddenly vibrating with mixed energy.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re gonna need a photographer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE BACK OF AN SLR CAMERA BEING LOADED WITH FILM
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HART’S TOWNHOUSE, CAPITOL HILL. DAWN.
text: Murphy sit in a rental car outside the house, as the sun
text: appears on the horizon. He does a crossword. In the back seat
text: with the camera is ROY VALENTINE, a photographer.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You're sure they’re in there?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Yep. Have you staked out before?
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (scoffs)
dialog: I mean, I’m not a paparazzi. Are we
dialog: even allowed to do this?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: A few years ago, I figured out most
dialog: of the planes carrying kilos of
dialog: coke into the US weren’t coming
dialog: from Colombia. They're actually
dialog: coming from the fucking Bahamas. So
dialog: I dig a little deeper. Turns out,
dialog: the prime minister is taking pay
dialog: offs from Miami lawyers to leave
text: beach front runways unguarded.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Wo.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Yeah, “Wo”. Sometimes you need to
dialog: catch someone in the act. I mean,
dialog: fuck, have you ever had to do this
dialog: kind of investigative journalism?
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 61.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (uncomfortable sharing)
dialog: Last year, I snuck into the Magic
dialog: Kingdom as a tourist. I cut right
dialog: into Tomorrowland, bought a rocket
dialog: pop, and when no one was looking, I
text: climbed a barricade and caught the
text: first images of Captain EO.
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: It was terrifying, but worth it.
text: A long look from Murphy. Suddenly, THE DOOR OPENS. It’s
text: Fiedler. He’s holding a printed out FAX.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Follow me around.
dialog: (passes it to Murphy)
dialog: Hart told the Post to follow him
dialog: around...
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: “Follow me around. Put a tail on
dialog: me. You’d be very bored.”
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: He asked _ us to follow him.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Technically speaking, we were
text: already following him.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: It’s an invitation.
dialog: (off Roy’s skepticism)
dialog: Look, if this were 20 years ago and
dialog: party bosses were still picking the
dialog: candidates in back rooms, that
dialog: would be one thing. But things
dialog: changed. Everyone forgets that.
dialog: They just handed these primaries
text: and caucuses back to some folks in
dialog: Iowa lined up around the Country
dialog: Kitchen to pick nominees they've
dialog: never heard of, you know, to vet
dialog: some governor or congressman from
dialog: god knows where? We have a

dialog: these guys accountable.

scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HART’S TOWNHOUSE - DAY
text: It’s RAINING. The rental car sits there. Three silhouettes
text: behind the windshield.
text: Inside, they’re eating individual cartons of Chinese. Just
text: watching and waiting for something to happen.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HART’S TOWNHOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: The car parked in the same spot. Murphy and Roy asleep.
text: Fiedler looks up from his newspaper.
text: He SEES a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE, and then a JOGGER.
text: Then, WILSON (policy aide) approaching the front door.
text: Murphy sits up for a better look. He lowers the window an
text: inch, hoping to hear. We barely hear the DOORBELL.
text: A moment later, the townhouse door opens revealing Hart,
text: wearing a white hoodie and jeans.
text: Wilson hands Hart a thick envelope. We barely make out what
dialog: they’re saying.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Hopefully this is the last draft.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Yeah, I’1l give it a look...
text: And then Hart freezes. He seems to be either lost in thought
text: or STARING STRAIGHT AT THE RENTAL CAR. Fiedler holds stock
text: still, not sure whether to go back to his paper or drive off,
text: when Hart gives a quick goodbye to Wilson and shuts the door.
text: Fiedler gives Murphy a shove.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What’s happening?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Wilson, policy guy.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: What is that, a speech writer?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: To a certain... He studies the
dialog: fluctuations in foreign... and...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 63.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER (CONT'D)
dialog: (Murphy doesn’t care)
dialog: Yes, he’s a speech writer.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Did he make you?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Don’t think so. Need a closer look.
text: Thinks for a second.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: TAGS BEING RIPPED OFF NEW JOGGING CLOTHES
scene_heading: EXT. HART’S TOWNHOUSE - LATE IN THE DAY
text: Fiedler, pretending to run in a ridiculous jogging suit,
text: trots past the rental car, giving Murphy a furtive glance.
text: He jogs onto the sidewalk and slows down as he passes Hart’s
text: townhouse. He’s trying to see through the windows but can’t
dialog: quite make anything out.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. FIEDLER’S RENTAL CAR - LAST LIGHT
text: Fiedler finishes his loop and jogs back up to the rental car
text: and gets back in the passenger seat. He’s sweating... Hard.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Jesus, you ran around the block.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Fuck off.
dialog: (looking for Roy)
dialog: Where’s our shooter?
text: Murphy nods toward the house. We SEE Roy with his CAMERA,
text: crouching behind a bush, trying to get a good angle.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: He’s young, excited. What was I
dialog: going to say?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: He’s going to get us caught.
text: We watch from the car as Roy gets closer to the townhouse.
text: Suddenly one by one, the WINDOW BLINDS SLAM SHUT.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 64.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck.
scene_heading: EXT. HART’S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: A beat as they watch the townhouse. The last glow of ambient
text: daylight disappears into night.
text: And then the front door of the townhouse opens. Hart comes
text: down the steps, still wearing his white hoodie.
text: Hart climbs inside his Chrysler. He’s visibly nervous. A
text: stark difference from his usual confidence and calm.
text: Hart checks the mirror as he pulls out slowly onto the
text: street. We SEE the Herald’s rental car reflected in the
text: mirror, pulling out to follow him.
text: Hart puts on his blinker and deliberately takes a right turn
text: onto a side street. He checks the mirror again, sees the car
dialog: following.
text: His jaw clenches. His breathing grows shallow. We can almost
text: hear his adrenaline.
text: He pulls to a slow crawl at a stop sign, waiting for the
text: Herald car to get close enough, and then Hart hits the brakes
text: - His TAIL LIGHTS illuminate the car behind him.
text: We can’t quite make out details, but we see three male faces,
text: bathed in a red glow. He shakes his head to himself.
text: Hart hits the gas. Quickly, he makes three right turns,
dialog: bringing us back to...
scene_heading: EXT. HART’S TOWNHOUSE, CAPITOL HILL - NIGHT
text: Hart re-parks the car outside his house. He takes a deep
text: breath. He gets out and looks behind him at the Herald’s
text: rental car, which has come to a stop a few car-lengths away.
text: He puts his head down, shoves his hands into his pockets, and
text: heads off briskly into the side alley.
text: The moment he rounds the corner, the Herald team quickly
text: pulls over and jumps out of the car. They briskly follow to
text: the mouth of the alley, visually checking in with each other
text: as they walk.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 65.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE ALLEY BY HART’S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The three Herald guys, Murphy leading the way, head toward an
text: intersection where a side alley meets a BACK ALLEY.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (hissing)
dialog: You were too close.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: (hissing back)
dialog: He was already on to us.
text: As they turn the corner into the back alley --
speaker_heading: HART (0.C.)
dialog: Good evening, gentlemen.
text: Standing in front of them, in his white hoodie, is HART.
text: A long silent beat. The three journalists from the Herald
text: line up across from Hart. Murphy out front. Fiedler in the
text: shadows. There’s an eerie High Noon quality to the stand off.
dialog: No one knows what to do. No one has ever been here before.
dialog: For better or for worse, they've breached a historical trust
dialog: between candidate and the press... and they must figure out
text: the next moment on their own.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (nervous )
dialog: Good evening, Senator. I'ma
dialog: reporter for the Miami Herald. We'd
dialog: like to talk to you.
text: Hart holds his ground, trying to decipher what’s happening.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Um... We’d like to ask you about
dialog: the woman who’s been staying in
dialog: your townhouse.
text: Hart doesn’t move. Composes his thoughts specifically.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: .-+. No one is staying in my
dialog: townhouse.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We saw you leave and return with a
dialog: woman last night. A blond woman?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I may. I may not have.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 66.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: We saw you.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I don’t know what you think you
dialog: saw...
text: FLASH - Roy takes a photo. It’s blinding and confusing in the
text: dark alleyway. It almost feels like a gun shot.
text: Fiedler steps forward.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Hello, Senator.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (registering Fiedler)
dialog: Tom?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Yes, sir. I uhh... I wonder if you
dialog: could tell us whether this woman
dialog: works for the campaign.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The one we saw you with.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: She is not part of my campaign.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Okay. Then can you tell us how you
dialog: know her?
text: FLASH - Another photo startles Hart.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Well... I don’t think that’s
dialog: relevant.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: Oh, I assure you, Senator, it’s
dialog: relevant --
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: It’s just that, we saw you leave
dialog: and come back with this woman. And
dialog: we didn’t see her leave again.
speaker_heading: FLASH!
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Tom, you can’t be serious. No one
dialog: is staying in my home but me.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 67.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: I am serious, sir. How long have
dialog: you known her?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: What kind of questions are these?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Is she a friend?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I don’t know why I would tell you
dialog: that. Tom, I am not --
speaker_heading: FLASH!
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Can you produce the woman so she
dialog: can corroborate what you’re saying?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I don’t have to produce... This has
dialog: gone on long enough.
text: Hart takes a step forward, as if to leave, and Roy snaps two
text: more photos, blinding Hart momentarily. Hart blinks. The
text: flashes begin to build now, more and more - Frustrating Hart.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Senator, we know you’ve made calls
dialog: to this woman. You called her from
dialog: Kansas. And New Hampshire. We have
dialog: the dates.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I make calls every day. I don’t see
dialog: how I’d remember, and I don’t see
dialog: how you’d --
dialog: FLASH, FLASH...
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: (stammering)
dialog: But... Senator... I was at your
dialog: announcement speech. You said...
dialog: you said... We must...
speaker_heading: FIEDLER (CONT'D) HART
dialog: (from his notebook) .+. I know what I said.
dialog: “Hold ourselves to the
dialog: highest possible standards of
dialog: integrity and ethics.”
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 68.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER (CONT'D)
dialog: So why am I standing here? Why am I
dialog: standing here in an alley ona
dialog: Saturday night? Don’t you think you
dialog: owe it to us to be forthcoming?
dialog: FLASH, FLASH...
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (scoffs)
dialog: Owe you?
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: You're denying what we've seen with
dialog: our own eyes!
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: The only thing I deny is the idea
dialog: that somehow you have the right to
dialog: ask these things.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: You're running for president!
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I’m aware of that, Tom. It’s in the
dialog: papers.
dialog: FLASH, FLASH...
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Then you have a responsibility --
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I know full well what my
dialog: responsibilities are.
dialog: (taking a step forward)
dialog: Do you know yours?
text: Hart goes to leave, but Murphy steps into his path.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Senator. Have you had sex with this
dialog: woman? !
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: What?!
dialog: FLASH, FLASH...
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: You should be ashamed of yourself.
dialog: (to Fiedler)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 69.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT’D)
dialog: The only one putting you in this
dialog: alley, Tom, is you.
text: Hart moves to the back door of the townhouse amidst multiple
text: FLASHES... And then he’s gone.
text: A moment as the two journalists and the photographer catch
dialog: their breath and look at each other - What just happened?
text: And then they scuttle off down the alleyway. We boom up to a
text: WINDOW and find Hart catching his breath. He grabs for a
text: phone. Begins to dial.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: (through the window)
dialog: Yeah, Billy. Find Dixon. Now.

speaker_heading: ARMANDT
dialog: We didn’t.
speaker_heading: BROADHURST
dialog: I’m asking Donna.
speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: BROADHURST
dialog: Donna, darling, I need you to be

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I told you, I didn’t -- Don’t
dialog: reporters follow him all the time?
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 70.
speaker_heading: BROADHURST
dialog: Gary says these guys are from

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I don’t know any reporters, Billy.

text: listening. One roll is already hanging and drying.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: (checking his watch)
dialog: 42 minutes.
dialog: (eyeing the screen)
dialog: You want to say linked here. Saying
text: she’s tied to Hart makes it sound -
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Professional?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: No, like ropes and chains and shit.
text: Fiedler grunts, nods and keeps typing. The phone rings.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (adding chemicals to the

speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Can’t. We lose half the readers.

speaker_heading: MURPHY

dialog: This can’t wait til Monday. It’s a

dialog: They want to know if we saw the

speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: (still typing furiously)
dialog: We did.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I mean we saw her... arrive.
speaker_heading: FIEDLER
dialog: Interview or conversation?

speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: DIXON

speaker_heading: DONNA

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I wanted a job with the campaign.
dialog: BB arranged the interview.
speaker_heading: DIXON

dialog: An interview?
text: Quick POP of Broadhurst and Armandt sitting nearby. He looks

speaker_heading: DIXON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DONNA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SHORE

scene_heading: INT. WASHINGTON POST NEWSROOM. CONTINUOUS.

dialog: It’s the Herald story: “Miami Woman Linked to Hart” and the

scene_heading: INT. STEVE MOSES’S STUDY, GEORGETOWN. LATE SUNDAY MORNING.

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: How you holding up?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (clearly shaken)
dialog: When we talk about a digitized

text: Dixon, confused, looks over at the nearby couch where Wilson
text: and Stratton sit. The three aides exchange ‘are we really

scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 81.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: We can’t hide from this, Gary.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Who's hiding? I’m working.
speaker_heading: DIXON

speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I’ve already spoken to the person

speaker_heading: DIXON

speaker_heading: HART

speaker_heading: DIXON

text: Hart’s still looking down at his remarks.
dialog: Gary..
speaker_heading: DIXON (CONT'D)

dialog: for one, and --
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Do we think they completely missed
dialog: the back door of the townhouse?
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: It’s not in the piece. They must
dialog: not have checked.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: If they don’t have her leaving...
speaker_heading: DIXON SHORE
dialog: Without the back door, the
dialog: entire article amounts to -
speaker_heading: STRATTON (CONT'D)
dialog: - Garbage. Come to think, I don’t
dialog: remember many alleyways in Florida.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Of course. Florida developed after
dialog: the industrial revolution. No horse
text: and carriage. It is a primarily
dialog: front door community...
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 82.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Gary...
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Forget the fucking back door! The
dialog: point is it’s nobody’s goddamn
dialog: business. None of it is. They
dialog: shouldn't have been there, period.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now, if we can all move on.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: That's what we’re trying to do.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I've been doing this for 20 years.
dialog: So have you. The public doesn’t
dialog: care about this crap. They won’t
dialog: stand for it.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: This isn’t ‘72. It’s not even ‘82.
dialog: It’s different now. I don’t know
dialog: why, but it is. If we get our story
dialog: down, we can --
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: There is no story! They can write
dialog: all this crap all they want, but
dialog: they will not earn the dignity of
dialog: my response!
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Jesus, Gary. How about us? Do we
dialog: deserve a response?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: About this? No.
text: Shore and Wilson look like kids whose parents are fighting.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: I’ve got a hundred kids unpacking
dialog: boxes back in Denver right now
dialog: because we told them you would do
dialog: what it took to win. I told them!

speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: She left me --
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 83.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: People are sacrificing for you.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I’m not sacrificing? Should I
dialog: sacrifice my privacy? My self-
dialog: respect? It won’t just be me who
dialog: gets dragged down. None of those
dialog: kids you’re talking about will ever
dialog: work another campaign where some
dialog: candidate doesn’t have to account
dialog: for who comes and goes from their
dialog: bedroom. And that’s just the
dialog: beginning.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: We're not talking about that.
dialog: Future campaigns, at the moment,
dialog: are not our responsibility. We’re
dialog: talking about how you get through
dialog: today without pissing away
dialog: everything we’ve worked for on this
dialog: campaign!
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: This campaign is about the future,
dialog: not rumors and sleaze. I care about

text: And he’s finished. Dixon pauses. Watching.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Wilson)
dialog: I want to reexamine the language on

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: You're kidding. Lynn?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Why were they interrogating me?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: The standard practice for a scandal
dialog: is to get all the damaging facts
dialog: out yourself - If there are any. So
dialog: it doesn't look like you're hiding.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: But you’ll keep me out of it? My

speaker_heading: KELLY

speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Your newsmen accosted me in my
text: alleyway. Some interview.
speaker_heading: MARTINDALE
dialog: With all due respect...
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: It’s a little late for respect,
dialog: sir. You ambushed me outside my

dialog: after putting me under some half-
dialog: baked stake out... During which,
dialog: your crack reporting team failed to
dialog: realize my home had a back door.
speaker_heading: MARTINDALE
dialog: (you're going with that?)
dialog: A back door?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Some surveillance is no better than
dialog: zero surveillance. In fact, it’s

speaker_heading: MARTINDALE
dialog: You do your job, we’ll do ours.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: It would be a welcome change.

speaker_heading: TED KOPPEL

text: We SEE a few photos up close - A smart looking political
text: woman is EMBRACING Hart and letting him into her house.
speaker_heading: BRODER
dialog: What a town.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: How did we get this?
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: Anonymous package.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I hate those. You got something to
dialog: say - Say it.
dialog: (to Kaiser)
dialog: Give me some of that gum.
speaker_heading: KAISER
dialog: You think Tydings sent it?
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: But why?
speaker_heading: BRODER
dialog: Are we going to even talk about
dialog: Bush? Hart’s running against the
dialog: former head of the CIA.
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 109.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Not yet, he’s not.
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: No return address, no note. Just a
dialog: date. Six months ago.
speaker_heading: KAISER
dialog: Well there’s your other shoe, Ben.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I mean, just because an unmarked
dialog: envelope lands in our laps. That
dialog: doesn’t obligate us to...
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: It’s a pattern of behavior.
dialog: Womanizing. Lies.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: He’s not lying to us.
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: Christ, don’t be so naive.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I have no doubt the same envelope
text: probably landed in the laps of
text: three other enterprising reporters.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Okay, I mean, can’t we let some
dialog: other paper run gossip as front
dialog: page news. Doesn’t mean we...
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: But it does, AJ. It does now.
dialog: (professorial)
dialog: We decline to publish, and then
text: some other pissant paper runs with
dialog: it anyway... I don’t know, the
dialog: Poughkeepsie Journal... or the
dialog: Miami Herald... or the New York
dialog: Times... And the TVs go fucking
dialog: apeshit over the story. And we get
dialog: on our high horse and say, well we
dialog: still don't think it's news,
dialog: because after all we didn’t think
dialog: it was news before, right?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 110.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT'D)
dialog: And now the wires are running a
dialog: story about how we won’t cover the
dialog: only thing anyone in the entire
dialog: country is talking about, and, so
dialog: on and so on.
text: A beat of silence. Bradlee looks to Broder - What do you
text: think...? Broder shakes his head - no.
scene_heading: INT. BREAK ROOM, WASHINGTON POST - EVENING
text: Parker walks up to find Devroy making coffee by herself.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Why do you hate him so much?
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: I don’t hate Gary Hart. I don’t
dialog: think I trust him...
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: That’s one approach.
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: That’s my job.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: To pass judgement?
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: To be skeptical. I don’t think his
dialog: own wife trusts him. Why should I?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I think you should trust him on the
dialog: things that matter.
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: Okay, I question his respect for
dialog: women.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Are you kidding me? He loves women.
dialog: Too much, frankly...
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: He uses them.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Aren’t we being a little precious
dialog: here? He’s smart and handsome and
dialog: these women are throwing themselves
dialog: at him...
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) lll.
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: He’s a man with power and
dialog: opportunity and that takes a
dialog: certain responsibility. If he was
dialog: some day trader screwing cocktail
dialog: girls, I could handle just not
dialog: liking him... but as our potential
dialog: next president, as a woman, that
dialog: makes me nervous... And as a
dialog: journalist, you should care.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I think you’re being a little
dialog: sensitive.
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: Oh, fuck you. You know what name
dialog: I'd like to hear Gary Hart say?
dialog: Donna Rice.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (combative)
dialog: What exactly is he supposed to say?
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: I don’t know. I’m not running for
dialog: president. He is. And now we get to
dialog: see what he does when he’s under
text: pressure. He throws a woman under
dialog: the campaign bus.
text: Devroy leaves with her coffee. A nearby clerk motions for
text: Parker’s attention.
scene_heading: INT. DARTMOUTH INN, HANOVER, NH - NIGHT
text: We find Irene Kelly, subdued, inside a phone booth. Dialing
text: number. It’s late. A hotel worker vacuums. Intercut with -
scene_heading: INT. BILL DIXON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The phone is ringing. We turn to see Dixon in his favorite
text: chair, watching the BASEBALL GAME. He ignores the incoming

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You're missing all the excitement.
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17)
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Thank God.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Looks like we’re turning the corner
dialog: out here. I could get you a flight.
text: Dixon has no response. Perhaps Kelly expected that.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: What’s on your mind?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I just keep thinking... This is
dialog: never going to be over for her.
dialog: Every time she applies for a job...
dialog: She doesn’t have a staff of
dialog: overeducated volunteers. As far as
dialog: I can tell, she’s alone.
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: You got anything for me?
text: Dixon thinks. He can’t tell her that she’s wrong.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Buck up kid. You’ve got work to do.
text: Kelly nods. Sucks it up.
scene_heading: INT. VIP SUITE, DARTMOUTH INN - NEXT MORNING

speaker_heading: SWEENEY (0.S.)
dialog: How're voters supposed to believe
dialog: you?! You've clearly been lying!
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: They will or they won't. I don’t
dialog: think they much care.
text: We SEE Shore sitting in plush chairs nearby, sipping a Coke.
text: Sweeney is pacing. Hart pops up.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: (friendly again)
dialog: You can cite the polls here.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I don’t care about polls.
speaker_heading: SHORE & WILSON
dialog: (finishing each other's
dialog: thoughts )
dialog: Yes you do. Gallup just came out of
dialog: the field - Do you think the media
dialog: went too far in its reporting on
dialog: Senator Hart's private life? 64
dialog: percent say yes. Do you think a
dialog: candidate's behavior in his
dialog: Marriage is relevant to his
dialog: qualifications as president? 38
dialog: percent say yes. 52 percent no.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Take that, fuckers.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: 64 percent. Got it.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (quietly to Shore)
dialog: They’1l ask about phone calls.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Uh-huh. I call lots of people.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Right. That’s fine.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Are we going to bring up Donna
dialog: Rice?
text: The mention of her name chills the room.
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 114.
speaker_heading: KELLY (CONT'D)
dialog: We could ask the pool to respect

speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Are you fucking nuts?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It could be seen as a noble
dialog: gesture.
text: Kelly looks to Hart for a response, but gets nothing.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: (to Hart)
dialog: They may ask you about, you know...
dialog: Women.
speaker_heading: HART
text: They can talk to Irene or Ginny.
dialog: Anyone who’s worked for me...
speaker_heading: SWEENEY & SHORE
dialog: Yeah, I think what Billy means...
dialog: Have there been others. Women that
dialog: aren't... your wife.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (turning quickly)
dialog: Now you have got to be kidding me!
dialog: I’m not going to answer that! Not
dialog: for them and not for you! That’s

speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: That's it! That’s perfect. That’s

text: There’s a knock at the door. It opens, revealing LEE HART.
text: The team quickly begins gathering their things to leave.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: I’'1l come back when it’s time.

text: Lee walks to the window.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I... I’m sorry... I...
dialog: Hart bows
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 115.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I’ve woken up the last two mornings
text: to the sound of helicopters.
dialog: They're waiting at our gates.
text: Dozens of them. Trucks with
dialog: satellites. Their trash littered
dialog: all over our driveway.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: How’s Andrea?
speaker_heading: LEE
text: She's disappointed.
text: his head in shame.
speaker_heading: LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: (stoic)
dialog: Just to leave our home, She had to
dialog: climb in the back seat. One of your
text: staffers threw an old blanket over
dialog: our daughter. That’s how she left
dialog: our house. Hiding like a criminal.
dialog: Like she should be ashamed.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (stumbling)
dialog: These people should be ashamed...
dialog: (adding)
dialog: The public won’t stand for it.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (staring out the window)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Lee... I’m so sorry.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I can imagine. Sorry you got
dialog: yourself in this mess.
dialog: (scoffs)
dialog: I’m sorry too.
text: Gary wants to apologize but doesn’t know how.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I feel so foolish.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Maybe I’m the foolish one. I gave
dialog: you all that rope and then I
text: tripped over it.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 116.
text: Lee begins walking to Gary.
speaker_heading: LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Were you thinking of me when you
dialog: were flirting with this girl? Were
dialog: you thinking of me on that boat
dialog: when you were making her laugh in
dialog: front of fifty other people? Were
dialog: you thinking of me when you invited
dialog: her into our home?
text: Gary shakes his head then drops it. A long beat.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Are you leaving me?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I didn’t fly across the country
dialog: just to say goodbye. That’s what
dialog: phones are for.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: You think you can you accept my
dialog: apology?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Not right now - Not yet - Maybe at
dialog: some point. And that might feel
dialog: like a burden. It should. You hurt
dialog: me... and you need to know that.
dialog: You need to feel it. Carry it so I
dialog: don’t have to.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: There'll be a time for us to talk
dialog: about why you did this and why I
dialog: should ever trust you again. But
dialog: that will have to wait. When it’s
dialog: just the two of us.

text: Bradlee wanders in.
speaker_heading: DEVROY (CONT'D)

text: absentmindedly as they discuss the following.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: At some point we need to draw a
dialog: line in the sand. We might not
dialog: agree where that line is...
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: Where does honesty fall?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Ask a man enough questions and
dialog: you're going to reach a point where
dialog: he either has to lie or simply
dialog: refrain from answering, which is
dialog: kind of the same as lying.
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: Maybe if he didn’t put himself ina
dialog: position where he needed to lie.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m talking about what’s relevant.
dialog: Some paper is going to want to know
dialog: if the president can still get it
dialog: up or if the first lady still goes
text: down on him...
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: I’m not asking to know any of that.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: But we’re opening a door... I don’t
dialog: know. Maybe the door’s already
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: DEVROY
dialog: I’m a reporter. I can only work
dialog: with what’s presented to me. I
dialog: follow leads. I look for the truth.
dialog: And the truth is he lied to his
dialog: wife and then he lied to all of us.
dialog: Is that relevant?
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 118.

scene_heading: EXT. DARTMOUTH INN, HANOVER, NH - NEXT MORNING

scene_heading: INT. DARTMOUTH INN RESTAURANT - MORNING
text: Shore walks up the staircase to the second floor dining area.
text: The place buzzes with anticipation. We find Parker at a table

text: At another table, McDaniel, Weinberg, and Shanahan watch
text: Parker with mixed envy.
speaker_heading: SHANAHAN

speaker_heading: WEINBERG

speaker_heading: SHORE
text: The senator is unavailable.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 119.
text: Shore keeps walking. Germond takes in the moment. The others

text: stands up and walks over to AJ Parker.
speaker_heading: BRODER
dialog: You know you don’t have to do this.

scene_heading: INT. HART’S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
text: Evidence of Hart having slept on the sofa. Gary and Lee get

speaker_heading: HART (0.S.)
dialog: Yes, over there, Ann.
scene_heading: INT. DARTMOUTH INN BANQUET ROOM, HANOVER, NH, AFTERNOON

text: stands surrounded by over one hundred sitting journalists and
text: photographers. Close enough to bite him. His team leans
text: against the wall along with Lee who stands by Irene Kelly.
speaker_heading: MCDANIEL
dialog: Doesn't this episode call your
dialog: judgment as a leader into question?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Yes, I suppose I made some
dialog: mistakes. But I think judgment,
dialog: like character, has to be measured
dialog: in the full context of a career. I
dialog: think what I’ve undertaken in the
dialog: Senate, the plans I’ve outlined for
dialog: the nation, speak to my judgment.
dialog: I’m not aware of anyone having

speaker_heading: VARIOUS REPORTERS

text: A quick look at Lee. Smiling and composed. Then we see Parker
text: watching her.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GERMOND
dialog: You were quoted once as saying you
dialog: love danger. Is that why you think
dialog: you put yourself in this position?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I don’t love it that much, Jack.
text: LAUGHTER among the press corps. A releasing of tension.
text: Angle on Shore, Sweeney, Wilson exchanging a relieved glance.
speaker_heading: SHANAHAN
dialog: You said there’s no relationship.
dialog: Are you willing to take a lie
dialog: detector test?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I think the voters are a pretty
dialog: good lie detector test.
text: Broder and Germond chuckling.
speaker_heading: WEINBERG
dialog: Will they believe you?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Well, I think they do. The last

dialog: think the Herald was out of line.
dialog: More than 60 percent, in fact.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: 64 percent.
speaker_heading: HART

speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Parker. Go ahead.

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (voice quivering)
dialog: Yes. Senator. Thank you. Good

speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Good afternoon to you, AJ. Glad you
dialog: could make it.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Yes. Senator, in your speech
dialog: yesterday you raised the issue of
dialog: morality. I’d like to, um, ask you
dialog: what you mean, specifically, by
dialog: that. I have a series of questions,
dialog: if you don’t mind.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: When you said you did nothing
dialog: ‘immoral’, did you mean that you
dialog: had no sexual relationship with
dialog: Donna Rice, last weekend or at any
dialog: other time?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I've said there was no
dialog: relationship. That’s correct.
text: A pause. Parker continues.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Do you believe that adultery is
dialog: immoral?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Do I...? Well, yes. I do.
text: Hart’s team grows uncomfortable with where this is going.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Senator. Have you ever committed
dialog: adultery?
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 122.
text: It gets so quiet, we almost hear a GASP in the group.
text: Older reporters shake their heads in disbelief.

text: We can see Sweeney hoping for Hart to come back swinging...
dialog: Come on... Come on...
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Say it... Say it...

text: He looks to Lee. He looks to his feet.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I...I...I guess I don’t think
dialog: that’s a fair question.
text: It’s a flinch. The campaign team bows their heads as the room
text: goes mad with questions and camera flashes, arms lifting for
dialog: follow up questions.
text: WYMAN, a photographer we recognise from earlier bar scenes, a
text: friend of Hart, makes eye contact with Hart... then goes back
text: to taking photos.
text: We see Broder leaving the room.
text: Hart and Lee exchange a look amidst the noise... Too many
text: questions at once.
dialog: And then quiet.
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN BUS - DAY
text: The Harts and their entourage sit quietly. They’re shell-

speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Are we doing the last event?
text: Hart’s rummaging in his suit pocket distractedly.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Supposed to have a Town Hall in

text: Hart produces a small blue figurine from his pocket. He
text: examines it in wonder.
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17)
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: I believe it’s called a Smurf.
speaker_heading: SHORE

speaker_heading: WAITER

speaker_heading: SHORE

speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: I‘ll take a coffee.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Same here.

speaker_heading: LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Gary?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Coffee?
text: Hart waves off the waiter.
text: MOVE TO the entrance of the restaurant. SWEENEY is returning
text: from the bathroom. He’s stopped by PARKER, who is holding a
text: now familiar PADDED ENVELOPE.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I need time with the candidate.
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 124.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: (venom)
dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Something’s come up. I have some
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: You think anyone’s letting you
dialog: anywhere near their candidate?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Come on, man...
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Oh, and I used to steal beer from
dialog: the corner deli in high school... I
dialog: tried coke at Berkley... and I
dialog: cheated on my girlfriend. Twice.
dialog: Just to save you the time.
text: Parker starts opening the PADDED ENVELOPE.
text: We move back to the Hart table.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Maybe we move up military reform.
dialog: Do a big rollout here.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: Yeah. It’s just...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (to Gary)
dialog: I need to call Andrea. I’1l be
dialog: right back.
text: Shore finds a couple dimes for Lee.
text: Hart kind of nods as we follow Lee to the PAY PHONES on the
text: wall. She begins to dial.
text: Back to Hart and the campaign team. We begin to push on Hart
text: as the chatter between Shore and Stratton becomes a low
text: whisper. Just noise along with the silverware.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: I’m all for shaking more hands. I’m
dialog: just not sure I can get him
text: anywhere near them just yet.
scene_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 125.
speaker_heading: SHORE WAITER
dialog: Could call Denver, get some (returning)
text: more bodies -- Fresh coffees. On the house.
speaker_heading: STRATTON (CONT'D)
dialog: What if... we booked some TV time.
dialog: I mean, how long would it take to
dialog: shoot a 30-minute spot?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Saying what?
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Can we pay for that?
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: Go directly to the voters. Talk
dialog: about reporters out of control,
dialog: invasion of privacy.
text: Hart looks to the entrance. He SEES Sweeney and Parker.
text: Sweeney is leafing through PHOTOS. His posture falling.
text: Hart leans towards Irene Kelly for a moment.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Any word from Miami?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: How do you mean?
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: Is she okay?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don’t know how you want me to
dialog: answer that.
text: Hart's face tightens. He nods. Registering the guilt.
text: BACK TO Sweeney and Parker. Sweeney now leafing through the
text: photos. His face doesn’t betray his feelings. He looks up.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Congratulations. You just became
dialog: the National Enquirer. You're fifty
text: cents at the register.
text: Back to the campaign team. Their conversation is down to a
text: whisper. The noise of the restaurant continues to build.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: I’m not sure enough people would
dialog: see it.
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 126.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: If the media won’t talk about it...
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: We'd need a national buy.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: Where the hell is Dixon?
text: And then Hart hears LEE on the phone cutting through the
text: rest. He turns to the PAY PHONES. Lee is clearly emotional.
text: Hart stands up and walks over to his wife.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (emotional on the phone)
dialog: OK, you're home now? And you’re
dialog: safe?
text: We faintly HEAR Andrea’s voice CRYING as she speaks. Hart is
text: slowly cracking.
speaker_heading: LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: It’s outrageous. They cannot, they
dialog: will not hound you like this. They
dialog: shouldn’t be anywhere near you. We
dialog: will take care of this.
text: Lee’s eyes begin to tear up as Gary pulls her into his arms -—
text: A family just trying to hold on.

dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Lee. It’s time to go home.
text: We move back to the campaign table. Sweeney is joining the
text: table, but Stratton, Shore, and Wilson have already clocked
text: the Harts at the pay phone. It couldn’t be more clear.
text: It’s over.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY, TROUBLESOME GULCH, COLORADO. MORNING.
text: We SEE the WAGONEER weaving through the NEWS VANS.
scene_heading: EXT. HART’S FRONT PORCH, TROUBLESOME GULCH - DAY
text: Trippi pours ice tea for the campaign team as Hart writes
text: notes on a legal pad. Ad-libbed thanks and comments, but it’s
text: mostly quiet. Stratton looks out the side, checking out the
text: helicopters with bewilderment. Shore pulls him away.
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 127.
text: Hart pauses. He looks out into the trees - Vast beautiful
text: Colorado. It’s wild and unmistakably American.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: You know, when General Lee resigned
dialog: his commission in the union army to
dialog: command the confederate forces, he
dialog: had to leave his house in
text: Washington behind.
text: The campaign team turns to listen. As does Lee, even though
dialog: she’s heard this story before.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT’D)
dialog: The union informed Lincoln and
dialog: asked if they should tear it down -
dialog: Light it on fire, what have you...
dialog: But Lincoln had a different idea.
dialog: He told them to bury the
dialog: confederate soldiers in Lee’s
dialog: backyard.
speaker_heading: STRATTON
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: HART
dialog: That’s how we got Arlington
dialog: cemetery.
text: Hart looks at his backyard - an infinite run of trees leading
text: to red mountains.
scene_heading: INT. HART CAMPAIGN OFFICE, DENVER - MORNING
text: For the first time - Quiet. A couple people answer phones.
text: Dixon approaches Terzano. Her eyes are red. He hands her an
text: ENVELOPE from a stack. She eyes him quizzically.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Cash it before the end of the day.
text: Dixon moves to Bill Martin and hands him an envelope.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, EXECUTIVE TOWER INN, DENVER - MORNING
text: PRELAP: the rapid clicking of a hundred camera shutters
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 128.
speaker_heading: HART (0.S.)
dialog: In public life, somethings may be
dialog: interesting, but that doesn’t
dialog: necessarily mean they’re important.
text: Hart is moving down a line of his campaign team, shaking
text: hands. In effect, saying goodbye to them. At 51, he is about
dialog: to walk way from public service for the rest of his life.
text: Each good bye carries its own weight - Stratton. Emerson.
dialog: Wilson. Kelly. Sweeney. Shore.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, EXECUTIVE TOWER INN - DAY
text: Hart enters to find Lee waiting for him. He sits across from
text: her. For a moment they just stare at each other. We can tell
dialog: by their body language that this is the beginning of a
dialog: difficult conversation. What will be the first of many. But
dialog: we CANNOT hear them. Rather, we give them their privacy.
text: Meanwhile, in the corner on a television, we see Hart at a
text: podium with no notes, giving his farewell.
scene_heading: INT. EXECUTIVE TOWER BALLROOM (ON TV) - DAY
text: The camera scans the crowd then cuts to Hart at the podium.
speaker_heading: HART (ON TV)
dialog: Clearly, under present
dialog: circumstances, this campaign can’t
dialog: go on. I refuse to submit my family
dialog: and my friends to further rumors
dialog: and gossip. It’s an intolerable
dialog: situation.
text: In the room: Hart reaches for Lee’s hand.
text: On TV: We see a brief moment of Parker watching.
speaker_heading: HART (ON TV) (CONT’D)
dialog: But we’re all going to have to
dialog: seriously question the system for
dialog: selecting our national leaders that
text: has reporters in bushes and
dialog: photographers peeking in our
dialog: windows. That reduces the press of
dialog: this nation into hunters and the
dialog: presidential candidates into the
dialog: hunted.
text: ON TV: As Hart gathers himself, we SEE Kelly, standing with
text: Shore and Wilson, starting to cry.
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (9/15/17) 129.
speaker_heading: HART (CONT'D)
text: After which, ponderous pundits
dialog: wonder in mock seriousness why some
dialog: of the best people in the country
dialog: choose not to run for high office.
dialog: Politics in this country is on the
dialog: verge of becoming another form of
dialog: athletic competition or sport. We’d
dialog: all better do something to make
dialog: this system work, or we’re all
text: going to be soon rephrasing
dialog: Jefferson to say: I tremble for my
dialog: country when I think we may, in
dialog: fact, get the kind of leaders we
dialog: deserve.
text: The TV goes out of focus. We push in on the Harts as Lee
text: takes Gary’s hands into her own.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
dialog:
