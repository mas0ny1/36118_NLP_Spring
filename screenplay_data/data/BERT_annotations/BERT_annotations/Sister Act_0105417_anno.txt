speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. ST. ANNE'S ACADEMY - AKRON, OHIO - CLASSROOM
text: We are in a parochial school classroom, in the late
text: Sixties. The children all wear uniforms and sit at little
text: desks. SISTER IMMACULATA stands at the front of the room;
text: she is a middle-aged nun, very severe. The children are
text: all terrified of her.
speaker_heading: SISTER IMMACULATA
dialog: Who can name all the Apostles? Yes?
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CHRISTINE CARTER
text: A thirteen-year-old girl sitting at a desk. She raises
text: her hand.
speaker_heading: SISTER IMMACULATA
dialog: Christine?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Sister, may I be excused?
speaker_heading: SISTER IMMACULATA
dialog: Christine...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: It's an emergency. Real bad.
text: Sister Immaculata nods, pursing her lips. Christine
text: stands and heads for the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS ROOM
text: Christine is now in the deserted St. Anne's girls room.
text: She is standing on tiptoes, looking in the mirror. She has
text: taken her hair out of its neat barrettes; she is combing it
text: out. She applies lipstick.
text: Christine reaches into her schoolbag; she pulls out a
text: stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on. She
text: unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse.
text: She sprays herself with dime store cologne.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY
text: Christine opens the girls' room door; she looks both ways.
text: No one is around; she saunters down the hall.
dialog: Page 2.
text: ANGLE ON A DOOR MARKED BROOM CLOSET
text: Christine opens this door. She looks into the closet.
text: There is a very nervous thirteen-year-old BOY waiting for
text: her inside.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Hi, Jimmy.
text: Christine slips inside the closet and closes the door
text: behind her.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SISTER IMMACULATA
text: Striding down the hall, with a bloodthirsty look in her
text: eye, and a nasty-looking wooden ruler in her hand. She
text: flings open the broom closet door,
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CHRISTINE AND JIMMY
text: in the broom closet. Jimmy's face is covered with
text: lipstick. Christine's hair is awry. The couple has
text: clearly been making out.
speaker_heading: SISTER IMMACULATA
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: Miss Christine Carter! Again! Don't
dialog: you know what happens to girls like you?
dialog: Don't you know what they become?
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTY'S APARTMENT - ANGLE ON A LARGE, TATTERED
speaker_heading: POSTER-NIGHT (TODAY)
text: Taped over a crack on a wall. The poster shows a
text: glittering CHRISTY VAN CARTIER: singing star of a fifth-
text: rate Vegas lounge. Christy wears tight spangles and a
text: major wig on the poster. She has clearly lived up, or
text: down, to all of Sister Immaculata's expectations.
text: The CAMERA PANS through the dark bedroom in which the
text: poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window,
text: casting a red and blue haze over the premises. A dressing
text: room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail
text: polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry
text: are scattered everywhere.
text: We hear the movement of BED SPRINGS as someone sits up in
text: the dark.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY'S VOICE
dialog: Come on, Vince -- hold me a minute.
speaker_heading: VINCE'S VOICE
dialog: I'd love to. babe -- but I've got to go.
dialog: It was great. Like usual.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY'S VOICE
text: It was twenty minutes. Like usual.
dialog: Page 3.
speaker_heading: VINCE'S VOICE
dialog: The best.
text: VINCE LAROCCA stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing
text: and checking his hair. Vince is a powerful, charismatic
text: man who rules an organized crime empire with personal
text: magnetism and threat. Vince's hold over Christy is
text: obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous
text: one minute, ruthless and dangerous the next.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (half to Christy, half
dialog: to the mirror)
dialog: You are something else.
text: Christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Come on -- stay. Just a little. We can
dialog: talk, I'll get a pizza. Pizza in bed,
dialog: we'll have fun. And you still haven't
dialog: told me what happened. What did she say?
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: What did who say?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Who? The other woman. Your wife.
text: Vince turns to face Christy, turning on the charm.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: You are so damn sexy.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Vince...
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: How did I get so lucky? What is it now,
dialog: five years we've been together? Who do I
dialog: thank?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (not buying it)
dialog: Today was the deadline, Vince.
text: Vince sits on the bed. He takes Christy's hand, and
dialog: kisses it.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: I want us to be together. Like people.
dialog: Honest, decent people. In the eyes of
dialog: God. Babe, today... I went to
dialog: confession.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You did what?
dialog: Page 4.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: For the first time in I don't know how
dialog: long. I wanted everything done right.
dialog: Open and above board. I told Father
dialog: Antonelli I was in love. I told him it
dialog: was a special love, for all the ages.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (starting to fall for
dialog: it)
dialog: You said that? And what did he say?
dialog: Did he say you could leave her? Did he
dialog: say we'd be happy?
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (looking deep into her
dialog: eyes)
dialog: He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn
dialog: in Hell. For all eternity.
text: Vince kisses Christy's hands again and drops turns away
text: and starts putting on his shoes.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What?
dialog: (outraged)
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: You want me to go against a priest? Get
dialog: excommunicated? You think I'm nuts?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You bastard!
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (trying to calm her)
dialog: We can still see each other. Just like
dialog: always. It's a different kind of sin.
dialog: Smaller.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You pig!
text: Vince backs off, and starts searching for his jacket.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Babe, it's not me! I love you! It's
dialog: God!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You lying sleazeball! The best years of
dialog: my life! What am I, garbage? Am I lint?
text: Vince ducks as Christy throws an ashtray at him, and it
text: smashes against the wall.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: You're upset. I understand. I should
dialog: go. I hate to.
dialog: Page 5.
text: A CLOCK-RADIO hits the wall beside Vince's head.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Get out of here! And never come back!
text: A LAMP hits the wall, as Vince dodges it. He makes a
text: phone gesture with his hand.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: I'll call.
text: Vince kisses two fingers, and blows the kiss to Christy.
text: He leaves.
text: Christy is left standing on the bed, holding a
text: particularly garish stuffed animal she was about to hurl.
text: With Vince gone she slumps to the bed, cradling the stuffed
text: animal. She is caught between tears and rage.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT
text: ANGLE on various neon Vegas landmarks -- the Golden
text: Nugget, Caesar's Palace, Bally's, etc. Scrunched in
text: between two larger hotels and casinos is the MOONLIGHT
text: HOTEL AND CASINO. The Moonlight isn't all that small, it's
dialog: just seen better days.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: A spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage. The
text: man is caped and dramatic, but not especially talented; an
text: Elvis impersonator who's just a shade off in voice, looks
dialog: and style.
speaker_heading: ELVIS
dialog: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Are
dialog: you lonesome tonight? Welcome to the
dialog: Moonlight Hotel and Casino's incredible
dialog: Platinum Oldies Spectacular.
text: Backstage, there's still a look of resolve in Christy's
text: eye as she waits to go on with MICHELLE and TINA, her back-
dialog: up singers.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: But you can't quit. What'll happen to
dialog: us?
dialog: (to Tina)
dialog: Tell her she can't quit.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I told her. She stuck pantyhose in my
dialog: mouth.
text: Onstage, Elvis glances into the wings to be sure the
dialog: Ronelles are ready.
dialog: Page 6.
speaker_heading: ELVIS
dialog: Please welcome our own girl group
dialog: extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty --
dialog: the fabulous Ronelles!
text: Elvis disappears. The spotlight hits Christy, who wears a
text: high beehive wig and a sequinned, early Supremes-style
text: gown. Michelle and Tina wear matching gowns and wigs. The
text: band begins a doo-wop vamp.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Oh, girls.
speaker_heading: RONELLES
dialog: Yes, Betty?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: This prom is a real drag.
speaker_heading: RONELLES
dialog: Oh-huh.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Oh my!
dialog: (gasping)
speaker_heading: RONELLES
dialog: What is it, Betty?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Look at that. Get a gander.
speaker_heading: RONELLES
dialog: Oh my!
dialog: (sighing)
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: He's so dreamy. He's like... a Greek
dialog: god. He's the cutest guy here. He's
dialog: boss. He's fab. He's...
speaker_heading: RONELLES
dialog: Yes, Betty?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (singing)
scene_heading: HE'S SO FINE.
speaker_heading: RONELLES
scene_heading: D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
text: WISH HE WAS MINE. THAT HANDSOME BOY
text: OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
text: As they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully
text: choreographed in vintage girl group style.
dialog: Page 7.
dialog: A lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the
text: number. While Christy does her best, her singing voice is
text: not on a par with those of the other Ronelles.
text: The lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few
text: drunken Shriners and a couple of college kids. POLICE
text: LIEUTENANT EDDIE MULCAHY sits at a ringside table with his
text: eyes locked on Christy. An easygoing charmer, Eddie gives
text: her a wink, but she responds with an up-yours look and a
text: turn to the other half of the room as the song continues.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER
text: A small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a
text: sputtering fan for ventilation. Christy has her own
text: dressing table and mirror, and the Ronelles share a table a
text: few feet away. Clothing and costumes hang on nails or are
text: draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Screw this dump. It's a roach motel
dialog: with sequins. Every guy I meet is either
dialog: married, a cop, or a lush from Des
dialog: Moines.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: But what about us?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: You taught us the act. The songs, all
dialog: the moves.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: And where did it get me? I'm stuck in
dialog: this rathole! You're holding me back,
dialog: just like Vince! I should be headlining!
text: A pock-faced weasel of a man named JOEY opens the door and
text: leans into the room.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What do you want? This is a private
dialog: area! Get lost!
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Then stop trying to memorize it. Hit
dialog: the road.
text: Joey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the
text: chair near Christy.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: From Vince.
dialog: Page 8.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: His ashes?
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: With love.
text: Joey leaves. Michelle and Tina hover around the box, very
text: excited. They pick it up, trying to tempt Christy.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: From Vince! With love!
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Michelle and Tina can't restrain
text: themselves: they open the box. Inside is
text: a rather gaudy fur coat. Michelle and
dialog: Tina are impressed.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: It's a fur!
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: It's new!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: It's a bribe. Five years of my
dialog: goddamned life!
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: So you earned it!
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Vince owns the casino! Cash in
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I should throw this in his facet
text: There's a KNOCK on the door, and Tina opens it.
text: Lieutenant Eddie Mulcahy enters. Christy is not pleased.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Oh, Jesus. What is going on here?
dialog: (to heaven)
dialog: Why me? Whose dog did I kill?
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Hi, Lieutenant.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Hello, Eddie.
text: Eddie picks up the coat.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: From Vince? What a guy. Doo-lang, doo-
dialog: lang.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: At least he's not a cop. At least he
dialog: can afford a decent gift.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I used to buy.you,..stuff. On your
dialog: birthday . When we were seeing each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers,
dialog: that your mother picked out? Lottery
dialog: tickets? A travel iron?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: So I don't shop.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: 'Cause you're always out, arresting
dialog: people. Making trouble. I don't know
dialog: why I went out with you in the first
dialog: place, it was embarrassing! I couldn't
dialog: hold my head up, I used to tell people
dialog: you were a security guard!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt?
dialog: You were singing in bowling alleys back
dialog: then. I told people you were a hooker!
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Calm down, you two. It's always like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a'
dialog: better class of people. Vince Laflocca.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: He's a businessman.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: A what? When are you qonna wake up?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: When are you gonna get off my case?
dialog: Have you got a search warrant? What do
dialog: you want -- cheap thrills?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Information, baby. I thought maybe
dialog: somebody around here might have a
dialog: conscience.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Think again! And get out of here.
dialog: Page 10.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm going. My regards to Vince, And
dialog: the Mrs.
text: Christy hurls a jar of cold cream at Eddie's head. He
text: ducks, and the jar hits the door.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Ladies.
text: Eddie leaves. Christy is standing, absolutely furious.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: That's it! I'm not taking it from him,
dialog: and I'm not taking it from Vince! From
dialog: now on, it's all about me! And if I
dialog: can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with
text: it -- it's gone. Like Sister Immaculata
dialog: used to say, "Life is short, and then you
dialog: fry." So long, girls -- see you in
dialog: church!
text: Christy grabs the mink and heads out the door.
scene_heading: INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: ERNIE SCHMIDT sits across the enormous mahogany desk from
text: Vince. The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating
text: bullets. The presence of Joey the weasel and WILLY, a
text: brutal thug, increases Ernie's tension.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Ernie Schmidt. How long you been with
dialog: us, Ernie Schmidt?
speaker_heading: ERNIE
text: Three years, Mr. LaRocca. One behind
text: the bar, two as croupier.
text: Vince gestures to the lush office and its furnishings.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Ernie, you know what's important to me?
dialog: What counts? It's not all this. This is
dialog: '-- what? Frosting. Loyalty. That's me,
dialog: Ernie. That's home.
text: Vince gestures to Joey, who takes out a revolver and
text: points it at Ernie's head.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: You ain't been loyal, Ernie. What did
dialog: you tell the cops?
text: Ernie's eyes open wide with denial as the gun comes closer
text: to his temple.
dialog: Page 11.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY
text: Holding the coat, Christy waits by the elevator. It
text: arrives; she gets in.
scene_heading: INT. VINCE'S OFFICE
text: The interrogation continues.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: I didn't tell the cops anything. I
dialog: swear.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Joey?
text: Joey slams Ernie on the side of the head with the gun.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Christy steps out of the elevator and faces a maze of
text: office cubicles with half-wall partitions. The floor is
text: deserted and dark as she makes her way through the
text: cubicles.
scene_heading: INT. VINCE'S OFFICE
text: Vince is standing over Ernie, holding his head up by the
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Who else, Ernie? Who else was in on it?
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: (moaning)
dialog: No one...
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (dropping Ernie's head
dialog: in disgust)
dialog: Why am I wasting my time?
scene_heading: INT. EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR
text: Beyond the cubicles, Christy strides down a lush corridor
text: to an executive suite. She tries the knob, but finds the
text: door locked. Pulling a key from her purse, she unlocks the
text: door to the suite and enters a large outer office with a
text: reception area and doors to several inner offices. She
text: tosses the key onto the receptionist's desk.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Won't need that anymore. Ta-ta.
text: Crossing to Vince's office, Christy squares her shoulders
text: and narrows her eyes with anger as she reaches for the
text: doorknob. She pauses for a second, and then doubles her
dialog: resolve.
dialog: Page 12.
scene_heading: INT. VINCE'S OFFICE
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Do it.
dialog: (to Joey)
text: ANGLE on the door to the office, which opens. Christy
text: appears, with the mink coat in her arms.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Stuff this up your...
text: A GUNSHOT is heard, 0.S. Christy's eyes widen, and her
text: jaw drops, at what she has just witnessed.
text: ANGLE on the office. Ernie is slumped in the chair, dead.
text: Joey stands over him, holding the revolver. Joey, Willy
text: and Vince stare at Christy.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Babe.
dialog: (icy calm)
text: Christy tries to speak; she can't.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Christy. Is there a problem? With the
dialog: coat?
text: Christy glances around the room; she doesn't move. She
text: quickly sizes up the situation. She tries to appear
text: matter-of-fact. unaffected by what she's just seen.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: No... it's fine.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Thanks. A lot.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Is that why you came up here, Christy?
dialog: To thank me?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: And to say you're sorry. About this
dialog: afternoon. And the things you said.
dialog: Forgotten. Completely. Do you
dialog: understand? Forgotten.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (catching the subtext)
dialog: Right. Yeah. Forgotten.
dialog: Page 13.
text: Vince crosses the room, to Christy. He takes her hands in
text: his, and kisses them.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: That's my girl. My girl in mink. Will
dialog: you be home? Soon?
text: Christy kisses Vince, quickly.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Right. I'll be... at the apartment.
dialog: Call me. Thanks. Again.
text: Christy reaches for the doorknob, without looking at the
text: door. She fumbles a bit. She finds the door.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Mink. Wow.
text: Christy walks backwards, out the door. She turns; she is
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Vince -- is she... okay?
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Maybe.
dialog: (considering this)
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind
dialog: of upset.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: She did.
dialog: (making a decision)
dialog: Bring her back. Now. For a talk.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: And if she runs?
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (icy)
dialog: Take care of it.
text: With guns drawn, Willy and Joey run after Christy.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION AREA
text: Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from
text: Vince's office. She passes through a glass door which
text: leads to the cubicle area.
text: LONG SHOT of the cubicle area, which resembles a darkened
text: maze. Christy hears Joey approaching; she runs into the
text: cubicle area.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Christy? He only wants to talk to you!
dialog: Page 14.
text: ANGLE on Christy, crouched behind a half-wall. She is
text: clutching the coat.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Christy?
text: There is a stuffed toy, a "Garfield the Cat," attached to
text: the wall near Christy, with suction cups. Christy tries to
text: pull the cat's feet off the wall, very quietly.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Christy?
text: Christy finally just yanks the cat off the wall. She
text: hurls it as high and as far as she can, to the opposite end
dialog: of the room.
text: ANGLE on the flying stuffed cat.
text: Joey sees the blur of the cat; he SHOOTS it, and the cat
text: explodes.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Come on, Christy! There's no place to
dialog: go!
text: Christy steadies herself against a Xerox machine. She
text: accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and
text: starts HUMMING.
text: ANGLE on Willy, as he hears the Xerox machine. He quickly
text: moves toward the SOUND.
text: Willy reaches the Xerox machine; the area is deserted. He
text: starts moving quickly down the aisle A chair, the kind on
text: casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways;
text: the chair hits Willy and he falls.
text: Christy runs out of the cubicle; Willy is on the floor,
text: struggling to get up. As Christy sprints away, Willy
text: SHOOTS at her. He misses, but a glass partition SHATTERS.
text: Christy runs for an open elevator, but it has been
text: summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to
text: close. She runs even faster. A BULLET whistles past her
text: ear and hits the back wall of the elevator. She reaches
text: for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone.
text: Christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs
text: into a stairwell as two more BULLETS bite pieces out of the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL
text: Taking the stairs three at a time, Christy is flying,
text: still clutching the mink. The thugs are gaining on her. A
text: BULLET hits metal and RICOCHETS off several walls and
dialog: steps.
dialog: Page 15.
text: At the next landing, Christy opens the door and ducks into
text: a corridor.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Exhausted but powered by adrenaline, Christy sprints past
text: doors to the end of the hall, still with the mink. Joey
text: appears from the stairwell just as Christy ducks into a
dialog: supply room.
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY ROOM
text: Christy shoves a cleaning cart aside and wades through a
text: pile of dirty linen. Joey opens the door just as Christy
text: dives head first into the laundry chute.
scene_heading: INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE
text: Christy, lying atop the mink, flies through the chute like
text: a subway train through a tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT
text: The chute spits Christy out like a bullet into a huge bin
text: of dirty linen. Two workers glance around as they load
text: large washing machines with laundry. Christy climbs out of
text: the bin and dashes for a door. Working in a hotel, the
dialog: workers have seen everything.
scene_heading: INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE
text: Joey flies through the chute.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT
text: Joey suddenly flies into the bin. He climbs out with his
text: gun in sight.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Which way?
text: The workers point to the door, and Joey rushes across the
text: room. One of the workers is now wearing the mink coat.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Joey comes out of the hotel and finds an empty street. He
text: looks in every direction, but the nearby streets have
dialog: swallowed Christy into safety for the moment.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: The central offices of the Las Vegas Police Department.
scene_heading: INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE
text: Eddie's office is a glassed-in area set in the middle of
text: the station's main floor.
dialog: Page 16.
text: Christy is huddled in a chair, surrounded by Eddie and two
text: other detectives, CLARKSON and TATE.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Right between the eyes! Down and out!
dialog: The guy was gone! I... I couldn't
dialog: believe it!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You couldn't believe it? Vince the
dialog: Prince?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I never said he was an altar boy, okay?
dialog: But he sent his goons after me! They
dialog: tried to kill me! I'm not kidding!
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
dialog: Tough break. Whoa.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What did you expect? Vince is as dirty
dialog: as they come. We've been finding bodies
dialog: around here for years.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I don't know anything about bodies! I
dialog: mean, he didn't bring it home. He was
dialog: good to me... sometimes. He was sweet.
dialog: He took care of me. Who am I supposed to
dialog: go out with? He owns a casino. He let
dialog: me sing.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: He didn't do you a favor.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Screw you!
speaker_heading: TATE
dialog: Come on, she'll sing great. When she
dialog: sings for us.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Sing -- like testify? Are you nuts? I
dialog: just want you to protect me! You're
dialog: cops!
speaker_heading: TATE
dialog: Busy cops. We don't have time to be
dialog: bodyguards for anyone who comes in here
text: with some cockamamie story. Mink coats
text: and laundry chutes.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
dialog: Unless, of course, you're willing to
dialog: testify.
dialog: Page 17.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What is this, some squeeze play? Can't
dialog: you just protect me without any strings?
text: The three detectives move in closer now and really apply
dialog: the pressure.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We could put you into our witness
dialog: protection program.
speaker_heading: TATE
text: A hiding place.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
text: A new identity.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: But you'd have to agree to testify. The
dialog: whole nine yards.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: And if I don't?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Then-you run.
speaker_heading: TATE
dialog: You wait.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
dialog: You listen for the footsteps.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Then one day they find you.
speaker_heading: TATE
text: They open a window.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
text: It's ten flights up.
speaker_heading: TATE
text: Ten flights down.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Ten flights?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You'd lose. You'd die. All over the
text: sidewalk. And into the street.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: All right! I get the picture! I'll do
dialog: it! I'll testify!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to Tate)
dialog: Get a stenographer.
dialog: Page 18.
text: Tate leaves. Christy looks to Eddie for a bargain now.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Okay, here's what I want. I know about
dialog: this stuff. A five-star hotel. With
dialog: room service.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Maybe Hawaii.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
dialog: Diamond Head.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Yeah. And I'll need a new look. Like a
dialog: disguise.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Maybe Armani.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
dialog: No -- Calvin Klein.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: For sportswear. And a limo. And my
dialog: hair -- up?
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
dialog: It could work.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Jesus, what do you think this is --
dialog: Wheel of Fortune? Let me spell it out
dialog: for you. You have to hide like you don't
dialog: even exist. You have to get so far
dialog: hidden away that you never see sunlight.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Okay -- no limo.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No nothing.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What're you gonna do, put me in a bag
dialog: and bury me?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm gonna put you in the last place on
dialog: Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
text: Eddie smiles. Christy doesn't like the sound of this at
dialog: all a
dialog: Page 19.
scene_heading: INT. STAINED CLASS WINDOW - DAY
text: Jesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount in vibrant red,
text: blue and green stained glass. An ORGAN plays a hymn --
text: badly. Notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated.
text: PAN DOWN to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel
text: at the ancient St. Katherine's Convent. The organ isn't
text: getting any better, and we see it is being played by SISTER
text: ALMA, a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing
text: aid. Apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because
text: Sister Alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's
dialog: playing.
text: As the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she
text: closes the door behind her. Across the lobby, the front
text: door opens and Eddie enters with a very reluctant Christy.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: I hate you. I totally hate you.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Safest place in the world. You think
dialog: Vince would look for you here?
text: As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious
text: artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V.
text: ANGLE on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of
text: hymnals, and a large, framed Sunday School-style portrait
text: of St. Katherine. Christy shudders.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here.
text: Everywhere. It's crawling with 'em.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: It's a convent. All you have to do is
dialog: shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: With nuns? With rulers? No way. I'm
dialog: gonna go back, work things out with
dialog: Vince.
text: Christy turns to head back to the entrance, but Eddie
text: catches her arm.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Vince has put out a contract on you. A
dialog: hundred grand. You've seen him in
dialog: action.
text: Christy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's
text: telling the truth.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: But... but Vince loves me. How could
dialog: he... I mean, five years...
dialog: Page 20.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: And one bullet. That's all it's gonna
dialog: take.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (suddenly scared)
dialog: But Vince has contacts all over the
dialog: place! This is San Francisco! They'll
dialog: be looking for me!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Everywhere but this little hole-in-the-
dialog: wall convent. Nobody knows you're here
dialog: but me. We're trying to get a quick
dialog: court date. A month, maybe two, tops.
dialog: I'll spring you as soon as I can.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (panicking)
dialog: I can't stay here! I'll crack up!
dialog: Eddie, what am I gonna do?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Pray.
dialog: (smiling)
text: From inside the chapel, the CHOIR begins to sing a hymn --
text: horribly. The voices don't blend, and individual notes are
text: real migraine material. Christy looks aghast. Eddie urges
text: her into a corridor, and she follows.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE
text: The office is bare and austere. MOTHER SUPERIOR sits at
text: her desk with her hands folded. Like all the nuns at the
text: convent, she wears the traditional full-length habit and
text: wimple.
text: Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys,
text: and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as
text: she rules. Control is her passion; within the walls of the
dialog: convent, she has created a world she can trust because it's
text: a world she controls.
text: But Mother Superior is not in control at
scene_heading: this particular moment. BISHOP GEORGE
text: O'HARA stands before her with a majestic
text: presence and some bad news.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Absolutely not. I am very sorry, but
dialog: no.
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: We can save this young woman's life, and
dialog: imprison a parasite -- all in one
dialog: gesture.
dialog: Page 21.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: But she's been exposed to the underside
text: of life. She is the underside of life.
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: And therefore an ideal prospect for
dialog: rehabilitation.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: We're a small convent, Bishop. Surely
dialog: there are... more appropriate shelters.
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: Your small convent is in danger of
dialog: closing, Reverend Mother. The Las Vegas
dialog: Police Department has offered to make a
dialog: generous financial donation.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: But, Bishop...
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order.
dialog: You have taken a Vow of Hospitality. To
dialog: all in need.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: I lied.
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: I know.
dialog: (smiling)
text: Mother Superior's jaw locks. She realizes she is stuck
dialog: with the situation and will have to control it as best she
text: can. There is a KNOCK at the door, and Eddie and Christy
dialog: enter.
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: Welcome, Lieutenant. Everything is in
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Aces. Bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee,
dialog: down at the corner?
dialog: The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior
text: panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Hey, you're not leaving me alone...
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: (reassuringly)
dialog: You're never alone in this house, my
dialog: child.
text: Eddie touches her gently on the arm.
dialog: Page 22.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: One month, two tops. Behave yourself.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Bishop...
dialog: (a last-ditch attempt)
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: (opening the door to
dialog: leave)
dialog: Lieutenant?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE CONVENT - A FEW SECONDS LATER
text: Eddie and Bishop 0'Hara are leaving, by the convent's
text: front door. As they exit, they hear the CHOIR, singing
text: horribly. They both wince at the sound, and then chuckle.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE
text: Christy is pacing, outraged at her new situation.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: A convent? They put me in a convent?
dialog: What's the problem? Wasn't there any
dialog: more room in Hell?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (very calm)
dialog: What is your full name? Your Christian
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Mother Theresa. Gandhi. Don't you
dialog: understand? This is all a mistake. I'm
dialog: the good guy. I'm the witness. And I'm
dialog: being punished!
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Your name?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Christy. Christy Van Cartier.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Enough joking.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: That's my real name! Currently I'm a
dialog: singer. Sort of.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Very well.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Oh my God. This isn't happening, tell
dialog: me this isn't happening. It's a
dialog: nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
dialog: Page 23.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: St. Anne's?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Parochial school. Akron. St.
dialog: Android's.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: You were unhappy?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I was expelled! When I was fifteen?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: The reason?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Beats me! What do you think? Smoking!
text: Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy
text: petting, with the chaperone. And wearing
text: a black bra, under my uniform. The demon
dialog: bra.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You see? You see? I have to get out of
dialog: here I have to make a phone call.
dialog: Don't you get it? I'm in a convent!
dialog: You're a nun!
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (very stern)
dialog: Sit down.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What?
text: Mother Superior rises. She is an extremely imposing
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Sit.
text: Christy sits in a wooden chair across from Mother
dialog: Superior.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Miss Van Cartier.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What?
dialog: (belligerent)
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Your cigarette -- out.
text: Christy inspects her cigarette.
dialog: Page 24.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (ruefully)
text: It has come to pass.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: I joined this convent some thirty years
dialog: ago. At that time, the world knew some
dialog: measure of peace. And hope. Our order
dialog: was a beacon of hospitality, to families,
text: to children, to a neighborhood filled
dialog: with promise. And, as the years have
dialog: passed, I have watched that promise
text: destroyed. Drugs. Gangs.
text: (staring at Christy's
dialog: outfit) Spandex. And.
dialog: so I have made this
dialog: convent an oasis, a
dialog: retreat from horror.
dialog: And now that horror has
dialog: invaded these sacred
dialog: walls.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Are you talking about me?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: And all those like you.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You mean black people?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The
dialog: heedless. And their Las Vegas
dialog: concubines.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (very suspicious)
dialog: What's a concubine?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Check your driver's license.
text: Christy stands, facing off with Mother Superior.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Fine. Got it. Look, the way I see it,
dialog: I'm stuck here, right? I mean, I'm here
dialog: or I'm target practice. So here's the
dialog: deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug
dialog: me. I'll catch up on some sleep, watch
dialog: some tube, lay back and lay low. So just
dialog: get me a key and show me to my room, and
dialog: do not disturb. Capisce?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (suspiciously
dialog: gracious)
text: Of course. But it's almost lunch.
dialog: Page 25.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Cool. Is there a menu? Or buffet?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Before we do, you might like to freshen
dialog: up. And you'll certainly want to change
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
text: (sniffing her clothes,
dialog: the same outfit she's
dialog: had on since the night
dialog: at Vince's office)
dialog: Deal.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM
text: A small room, with a sewing machine, some bolts of fabric,
text: and several wooden cabinets. There is a wooden screen in a
text: corner, marking a changing area. Christy is behind the
text: screen; we hear her, but do not see her, Mother Superior
text: stands beside the screen, catching the various items of
text: clothing which Christy tosses to her.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY (O.S.)
dialog: How about a robe? One of those big
text: terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on
dialog: the pocket. "Guest of St. Katherine's"
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Would you like that?
text: Mother Superior takes Christy's skirt and blouse, and
text: tosses them down a chute marked "INCINERATOR."
speaker_heading: CHRISTY (O.S.)
dialog: You should hand-wash that blouse, and
dialog: send somebody out for some things. I
dialog: look good in reds, purples, hot pink --
dialog: and shoes. Five-inch heels. Fuck-me
dialog: pumps. Oh, man -- sorry. 'Scuse my
dialog: mouth.
text: Mother Superior carries Christy's lacy bra at the end of a
text: ruler; it goes down the incinerator.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Excused. Open the cabinet to your left.
dialog: You will find appropriate attire.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY (O.S.)
dialog: Can do.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL
text: A group of nuns are praying, their heads bowed. They hear
text: a muffled SCREAM, from elsewhere in the convent. They look
text: up, puzzled.
dialog: Page 26.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM
text: Christy is standing before a full-length mirror, staring
text: at herself, in complete shock. She now wears a habit and
text: wimple. Mother Superior is doing final adjustments on the
text: wimple.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (almost unable to
dialog: speak)
dialog: No! No! I can't do this!
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb,
dialog: and you endanger us all. While you are
dialog: here, you will conduct yourself as a nun.
dialog: Only I shall know who, and what, you
dialog: truly are. You will not disrupt the
dialog: convent. You will not influence the
dialog: Sisters with your colorful street talk.
dialog: You will draw no attention to yourself in
dialog: any way.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (furious, in
dialog: disbelief)
dialog: But look at rites Look at this! I'm a
dialog: nun! I'm invisible! I'm a penguin!
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: As of now, and until you leave, you are
dialog: Sister Mary Clarence.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: Mary Clarence? Like a guy? Like a dumb
dialog: guy?
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER
text: Mother Superior is striding down the hall. Christy is
text: beside her, trying to get the hang of her new outfit.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
text: The Mary is in deference to the Holy
dialog: Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint
dialog: Clarence Loyola. There are three vows
dialog: that every nun must accept. The vow of
dialog: poverty...
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (pulling out her
dialog: pockets)
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: The vow of obedience.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Like to who?
dialog: Page 27.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: And the vow of chastity.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I'm outta here.
text: Christy starts to leave; Mother Superior grabs her by the
dialog: wimple
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT DINING HALL
text: A large, whitewashed gothic room, with oak beams and a
text: crude iron chandelier. There is a long, central wooden
text: table, with rough wooden benches.
text: The convent's population is standing around the table in
text: silence. There are about thirty nuns in all.
text: Mother Superior moves to the head of the table, with
text: Christy following her. She motions for Christy to stand at
dialog: her right.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Good afternoon, Sisters. I apologize
dialog: for my tardiness. I would like you to
dialog: welcome a new member of our order, Sister
dialog: Mary Clarence.
text: ANGLE on SISTER MARY ROBERT, the nun standing beside
text: Christy. Sister Mary Robert is naive and mouse- like, but
dialog: very sweet. She has only been at the convent a few years;
text: she wears the simpler habit of a novice. She sneaks a look
text: at Christy. Her eyes widen, and then she resumes staring
text: at her hands.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
text: Mary Clarence comes to us from a
text: somewhat more progressive convent. She
text: is eager for a more disciplined life, and
dialog: will make every effort to conform to our
dialog: ways.
text: Everyone sits, including Christy. SISTER MARY PATRICK, a
text: nun seated at the middle of the table, waves her hand. Mary
text: Patrick is extremely cheerful, a truly upbeat person.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Yes, Mary Patrick?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Reverend Mother, on behalf of the
dialog: sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary
dialog: Clarence to St. Katherine's.
text: ANGLE on Christy, looking thoroughly disgusted.
dialog: Page 28.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: As part of our welcome, I've had a
dialog: little thought, just for fun. Could we
dialog: have our new friend offer today's
dialog: blessing?
text: ANGLE on the nuns, watching Christy.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: Very well. Mary Clarence, rise please.
text: Christy stands up slowly, aghast.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: A blessing? Like, for lunch?
text: ANGLE on Mary Patrick, beaming. She and the other nuns
text: bow their heads.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (trying to recall a
dialog: blessing)
dialog: For what we are about to receive...
text: So far, so good. Mother Superior has one eye open.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: may the Lord... prepare us and... watch
dialog: us and... walk through the valley and be
dialog: our shepherd and... to the republic for
dialog: which it stands... God bless us every
dialog: one, hallowed be thy name. Hallelujah.
dialog: Ave Maria. Boyardee. Amen.
text: ANGLE on the nuns, staring at Christy. Mother Superior
text: rises, very quickly.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Sisters, for the rest of the day we
dialog: shall declare a Vow of Silence.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Surely you are familiar with this
dialog: practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our
dialog: lips are silent, can our prayers truly be
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Silence? No talking? All day?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Until sundown.
dialog: Page 29.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
text: (mouthing the words.
dialog: without speaking aloud)
dialog: Oh my God.
text: Christy reaches for a piece of bread.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: And Mary Clarence?
text: Christy looks up.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: As a new member of our order, I think
dialog: you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (mouthing the words)
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: A fast. To remind us of the poor, of
dialog: those who must endure without enough to
dialog: eat.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (mouthing)
dialog: No food?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (taking away Christy's
dialog: plate)
text: No food. Not until sundown.
text: ANGLE on Christy, clutching her fork, hungrily watching
text: the other nuns eat.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: Vince leaves the police station with his henchmen, Joey
text: and Willy, and LARRY NARREN, an attorney. Vince is
text: steaming as they walk through the parking lot.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: They grilled me for six hours in there.
dialog: And my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell
dialog: were you?
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: It takes time, Vince. Slow and steady.
dialog: We've been through this before.
text: Vince reaches his car. As Joey opens the door for him,
text: another car drives by, and stops. Eddie is driving; he
text: leans out the window.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: So long, Vince. See you soon.
dialog: Page 30.
text: Vince lurches toward Eddie; Larry restrains him. Eddie
text: drives off, chuckling.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: He's so damn cocky. This is different.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: It's a bluff, Vince.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: You know so much. They've got Christy,
dialog: and we've got to find her. Get her 8x10,
text: from in front of the lounge. Fax it to
dialog: every contact we got.
text: Larry covers his ears with both hands.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I can't hear this. I'm an attorney,
dialog: Vince, and you're just an honest casino
text: owner. Object of a witch hunt. Innocent
dialog: victim.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Keep the message vague, but let 'em
dialog: know. The price has gone up. Christy
dialog: Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million.
text: Dead or nearby.
text: Vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT VEGETABLE GARDEN - DAY
text: The vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a
text: patch of land surrounded by high walls. Various sections
text: have been partitioned with string and then furrowed.
text: Several nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking.
text: They wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples.
text: Christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat. She is
text: hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest. She picks up
text: a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see
text: if anyone is watching. She starts to gnaw on the carrot.
text: She becomes aware that someone is watching her. She looks
dialog: up.
text: Sister Mary Robert is watching Christy eat the carrot,
text: breaking her fast. Christy drops the carrot on the ground,
text: as if it burned her. Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the
text: next furrow over.
text: Christy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes.
text: Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their
text: tasks. Christy decides that she will try and make Sister
text: Mary Robert talk. She picks up the carrot and tosses it
text: at Mary Robert. Mary Robert jumps. She waggles a finger
text: at Christy, scolding her. Mary Robert resumes hoeing.
dialog: Page 31.
text: Christy is now determined. She takes her hoe, and tiptoes
text: nearer to Mary Robert. Very gently, she uses the handle of
text: the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her.
text: Mary Robert vips, very loudly. All the other nuns turn
text: and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her. Christy waggles
text: her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her.
text: Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing. She sees
text: Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow. Mother
text: Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET - THAT NIGHT
text: LONG SHOT of the sun going down, ending the nuns' Vow of
dialog: Silence.
dialog: We hear Christy SCREAM, O.S.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT
text: This hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors
text: with tiny, grilled windows. These are the cells where the
text: nuns sleep. Nuns are entering their cells and closing
text: their doors for the night.
text: Mother Superior glides down the hall, followed by a dusty,
text: bedraggled Christy. Christy is devouring a slice of brown
dialog: bread.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Is this all the food I get?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Yes. Until breakfast.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: That's tomorrow! Don't you have any
dialog: snacks? Machines?
text: They stop by a door.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: My what?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Your cell. Your room.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTY'S CELL
text: The door swings open, and Mother Superior and Christy
text: enter. The room is tiny, with bare plaster walls. There
text: is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin-covered
text: mattress. There is a small nightstand and a wooden stool.
dialog: Page 32.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: You were right the first time. Is this
dialog: like, solitary? The cooler? Where's the
dialog: furniture?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Our lives are simple. We have little
dialog: need for material possessions.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Right, sure thing. But what about,
dialog: like, appliances? Like a little color
dialog: portable? Boom box?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Useless distractions.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (sinking to the bed)
dialog: It's like the Stone Age. The room time
dialog: forgot. What about a phone?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: And whom would you call?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Oh, I don't know... Satan?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (not amused)
dialog: Your cell is more than adequate.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Right. So what do we do now? Ping-
dialog: Pong? Row over to the monastery?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
text: It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Wait. No. You're kidding. Lights out?
dialog: At nine? My day's just starting.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: I'm sure. If I were you, I would use
dialog: this time, to think about my life. And
dialog: its direction. Or lack thereof.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: What's wrong with my life?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: From all I've heard, just about
dialog: everything. Your singing career seems
dialog: all but nonexistent, and your married
dialog: lover wants you dead.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Page 33
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: If you're fooling anyone, it's only
dialog: yourself. God has brought you here. Take
text: the hint.
text: Mother Superior leaves.
text: After the door shuts, Christy stands and looks out the one
text: small window in her cell. She leans her head against the
text: wall. She is trying not to think about what Mother
dialog: Superior has said. Still, the mess her life has become
text: overwhelms her. She fights back tears.

scene_heading: INT. CHRISTY'S CELL
text: Christy is fast asleep. There is a RAPPING at the door.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT (0.S.)
dialog: Sister Mary Clarence!
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT HALLWAY
text: All the nuns are proceeding, in their simple robes and
text: nightshirts, down the hallway.
text: Christy's door opens; she is still in her nightshirt, and
text: her hair is a mess.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What?
text: Mary Robert, in her nightshirt, stands outside.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Come on, we're late.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What? What time is it?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
text: It's after five. We have to bathe.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (groaning)
dialog: Five a.m.?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Christy is standing on line in the hall, along with
text: several other nuns; they are waiting to take showers. They
dialog: carry soap and towels.
dialog: Page 34.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: Isn't it a glorious morning? Good
dialog: morning, Mary Clarence. sleep well?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Is this like your old convent?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Which convent was that, Sister?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Which convent? It was, um, the Little
text: Sisters... of the Moonlight. In Vegas.
dialog: Everybody used to come to Mass. Frank.
text: Dean. Sammy. Right at ringside.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: Enough jabber.
text: MARY LAZARUS is a much older nun; she is very no-nonsense,
text: a hard-liner.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: Progressive convents. Vanity. It
dialog: sounds awful. It sounds just like this
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Like this place?
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out
dialog: in the woods. It wasn't all modern, like
dialog: here. No electricity. Cold water. Bare
dialog: feet. Those were nuns. It was Hell on
dialog: earth, but I loved it. This place is a
dialog: Hilton.
scene_heading: INT. BATHING ROOM
text: A stone room that is very medieval-looking. One wall is
text: divided into stalls by wooden partitions. In each stall is
text: a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a
text: thin stream of lukewarm water. We see only the nuns' heads
dialog: and shoulders.
text: Still sleepy, Christy leans against the wall of her stall,
text: her eyes closed. Lost in thought, she begins singing
text: softly to herself.
dialog: Page 35.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
scene_heading: MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
dialog: AND YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE
scene_heading: A FEW OTHER NUNS
dialog: (very softly)
scene_heading: HEY-LA, HEY-LA
text: Christy looks up from her reverie; she looks around. The
text: other nuns are bathing, their eyes down. There is no sign
text: of singing. Christy decides to try a test.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
scene_heading: MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
scene_heading: HE'S GONNA SAVE MY REPUTATION

scene_heading: HEY-LA, HEY-LA

dialog: IF I WERE YOU,
scene_heading: I'D TAKE A PERMANENT VACATION
text: A FEW OF THE NUNS
scene_heading: HEY-LA, HEY-LA
scene_heading: MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
text: The nuns giggle.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Where did that come from?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: I haven't heard that song in ages. The
dialog: Ronettes?
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: (very grouchy)
dialog: Shirelles.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You know that song?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: 1961? '62? Mary Clarence, that's when
dialog: many of us took final vows. It's the
dialog: last secular music we recall.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: No.
scene_heading: HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING
dialog: NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
speaker_heading: ALL THE NUNS
scene_heading: HEY-LA, HEY LA
dialog: Page 36.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: (cutting off the song)
dialog: That's enough. We've got to get to
dialog: chapel.
text: Mary Lazarus leaves the bathing room, and the other nuns
text: resume scrubbing themselves. Christy looks around.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Anybody got conditioner?
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Bishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday mass. He stands in
text: the pulpit. The choir nuns stand in a fenced-in area to
text: his left. The remaining nuns, including Christy and Mother
text: Superior, sit in the first few pews.
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: We are a small congregation this
dialog: morning. Too many mornings. Something
dialog: has gone terribly wrong. Where is
dialog: faith? Where is celebration? Where is
dialog: everyone? Still, rather than regret the
dialog: absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice
dialog: in the fellowship of those present. Our
dialog: choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has
dialog: informed me that our choir, while always
dialog: superior, has been toiling especially
dialog: hard on this week's selection. Sister?
text: Mary Lazarus raises her hand, and the choir begins
text: singing. They sing a traditional hymn, "Let Thy Thoughts Be
dialog: Guided." As always, their singing is dreadful; they have no
text: tempo or pitch, and the hymn becomes an off-key drone.
text: As the hymn continues, the CAMERA PANS OVER the chapel.
text: Aside from the nuns, it is almost empty; only a few elderly
text: people are in attendance.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CHRISTY
text: sitting with the other nuns. She is clearly about to fall
text: asleep. Then the choir hits a particularly horrendous
text: note, and Christy jerks awake. She immediately tries to
text: assume a pious expression, tilting her head and folding her
text: hands in prayer; she looks like a somewhat demented Sunday
dialog: School calendar.
scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT
text: Detective Clarkson gets out of his car and hurries into
text: the police station.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION
text: Clarkson crosses the busy room to Eddie's glass-walled

dialog: him.
dialog: Page 37.
scene_heading: INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE
text: Eddie looks up from his desk as the two detectives enter.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
dialog: There was a raid on a pawnshop in L.A.
dialog: this morning. The place was fencing
dialog: stolen property. They found this.
text: Clarkson gives Eddie a fax sheet, showing a publicity
dialog: photograph of Christy.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Jesus. Data-base hoods. It's a
dialog: wonderful world.
dialog: (reading the fax
dialog: sheet)
text: Beloved daughter missing. Reward of two
dialog: hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
dialog: Please find our adored angel, we miss her

speaker_heading: TATE
text: Vince is getting desperate. Where is
dialog: she, Eddie? Where'd you stash her?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Where's who?
speaker_heading: TATE
dialog: You won't even tell us?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT SCHOOLROOM - AN HOUR LATER
text: A plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student-style
text: desks. A group of about eight local TEENAGE GIRLS has
text: gathered. The girls wear extremes of hair, makeup and
text: clothing; they are bored and scruffy, clearly the local bad
text: Girls. Sister Mary Patrick is leading the class, in her
dialog: usual perky manner.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Good afternoon, young ladies. And
dialog: welcome to our Christian Youth Group.
text: The Girls make grunting noises.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Hi. I hope we'll have some fun, and
dialog: maybe learn a little something, too. Now,
dialog: today's topic is something very up-to-
dialog: date -- "Teenage Promiscuity." My. Now,
dialog: can anyone tell me -- just what is
dialog: promiscuity?
text: ANGLE on the Girls, exchanging glances and rolling their
text: eyes.
dialog: Page 38
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Anyone? Yes?
text: Mary Patrick points to a Girl in bicycle pants. a bustier
text: and a leather baseball cap. Her name is Lawanda.
speaker_heading: LAWANDA
dialog: Uh, it's like, you know, doin' it. A
dialog: whole lot. Till your head falls off.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: (blushing)
dialog: Well, yes. That is one way to put it.
text: Mother Superior enters the classroom accompanied by
dialog: Christy
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Sister Mary Patrick?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: I need to see you, at once. Girls,
dialog: please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a
dialog: few moments. Mary Clarence?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence.
dialog: She'll be minding you until Sister Mary
dialog: Patrick's return. Mary Clarence, please
dialog: assign a biblical passage. Do not
dialog: attempt discussion. Am I understood?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I got it.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (to Mary Patrick)
dialog: Come, Sister.
text: Mother Superior and Mary Patrick leave the classroom.
text: Christy now stands at the front of the room. She is
text: visibly uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: So, hi there. I'm... Sister Mary
dialog: Clarence. And you're... young
dialog: Christians. I guess I should assign you
dialog: this passage. What's good? What were
dialog: you talking about?
speaker_heading: LAWANDA
dialog: We were talking about the wild thing.
dialog: Teen promiscuity.
dialog: Page 39
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing
dialog: it. You know she thinks it's a sin.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (trying to behave)
dialog: Well... yes. Yes it is.
speaker_heading: LAWANDA
dialog: (goading Christy)
dialog: How come? Sister?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (still trying to
dialog: behave)
dialog: Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou
dialog: shalt not..." Thou shalt not.
text: The Girls all laugh and make jeering noises.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Excuse me -- just what are you all doing
dialog: here? At Sunday School?
speaker_heading: LAWANDA
dialog: 'Cause we love it so damn much. And
dialog: cause we gotta come here. Probation.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Probation?
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: Yeah. We all got caught. Shoplifting.
dialog: Cuttin' school. Cuttin' up some bitch
dialog: with a blade. So we gotta come here. So
dialog: we'll be good, in the future. So we'll
dialog: learn valuable lessons. And I learned
dialog: mine. I will be incredibly good, I will
dialog: never rip out nobody's nose-ring by
dialog: accident ever again. Can I go now?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (getting fed up)
dialog: Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can
dialog: tell.
speaker_heading: LAWANDA
dialog: Well, what would you know about it,
dialog: anyway? What do any of you nunheads know
dialog: about anything? About doin' the nasty,
dialog: or gettin' high?
speaker_heading: CONCHITA
dialog: Leave her alone, Lawanda, she's just
dialog: some ol' nun! Don't pick on no nun, it's
dialog: bad luck!
dialog: Page 40.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (fed up)
dialog: Shut up!
text: All the Girls look up, stunned by Christy's language.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want
dialog: to ask me something? You want to listen,
dialog: for once in your little lives? You want
dialog: to pay some attention?
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: What about crack? You a user?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
text: All the girls jeer at Charlene.
speaker_heading: KESHIA
dialog: Got you, Charlene!
speaker_heading: CONCHITA
dialog: Dunked by the nun!
speaker_heading: LAWANDA
dialog: (more sincerely)
dialog: Well, what about the sex stuff? What if
dialog: some dude is after you, and he's always
dialog: saying stuff, commin' on sweet and
dialog: mellow. Like, oh, baby, you know you'll
dialog: love it. Oh, baby, if you loved me,
dialog: you'd stay.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: And you listen to that?
speaker_heading: LAWANDA
dialog: No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: LAWANDA
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: What you do?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Just tell him, I do love you, but I
dialog: can't -- I'm a nun.
text: The girls all laugh; they are really beginning to like
dialog: Christy.
dialog: Page 41.
speaker_heading: CHARLENE
dialog: But, like what if you are doin' it? What
dialog: about protection? Who's responsible?
speaker_heading: CONCHITA
dialog: What about them things, you know, for
dialog: the guy? Aren't they like, a mess to put
dialog: on? Don't they kinda mess up the mood?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Deal with it, sweet thing. It's
dialog: important, nowadays. You just practice
text: at home, with a balloon and a banana.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR (0.S.)
dialog: Mary Clarence!
text: Mother Superior has returned, with Mary Patrick. Everyone
text: has been so wrapped up in the discussion, that no one has
dialog: noticed their entrance.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (thinking on her feet)
dialog: Because a banana is part of a balanced
dialog: breakfast. And don't forget fiber.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY
text: Mother Superior is seated behind her desk; she is very
text: angry. Christy sits across from her.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: A balloon and a banana! Tell me, Mary
dialog: Clarence, what were you thinking?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Those girls were asking questions.
dialog: They've got it rough. I wish somebody
dialog: had talked to me about that stuff when
dialog: was their age. I wish somebody would
dialog: talk to me about it now.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: This is a convent, not a clinic. We
dialog: offer moral guidance, not hardware.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Have you been out in those streets? Do
dialog: you know what those kids are up against?
dialog: You should help them!
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: We are nuns. We seek solutions through
dialog: prayer.
dialog: Page 42.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Sometimes it's not enough!
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: You are correct. Sometimes prayer alone
dialog: cannot help a situation. Such as your
dialog: own, for example. How do you feel about
dialog: physical labor?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: It never solves anything.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Do your recall the words of Saint Peter,
dialog: in Ecciesiastes 1:27? He spoke unto a
dialog: wastrel youth. He said, "Take up thy
dialog: task, and know ye the path of
dialog: contentment."
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: In English?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary
dialog: Clarence. "No pain, no gain."
text: Mother Superior smiles in a rather evil manner.
scene_heading: INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Vince is on the telephone in his office at the Moonlight
text: Hotel and Casino. He clearly has a new mistress or two.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (very seductive)
dialog: Baby, you know I do... of course... I
dialog: feel it too... I'm blushing... can you
dialog: hold?
text: A second telephone RINGS, and Willy answers it. Vince
text: meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved
text: in a second romantic call.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me...
dialog: how lonely?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: It's that call you were expecting,
dialog: Vince.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Can you hold? Can you try?
text: Willy passes the phone to Vince. t
dialog: Page 43
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Have you found out where Christy is yet?
dialog: Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! You want
dialog: to try making it on a cop's salary? Find
dialog: her, and find her now!
text: Vince passes the phone back to Willy.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Raise the ante to three hundred grand.
text: Willy heads for the fax machine. Vince regains his
text: composure, and picks up his own phone; he pushes a button.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Sorry, baby... you are? Totally? Not a
dialog: stitch?... Yeah, I'm naked too...
dialog: inside...
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT CRAFTS ROOM
text: This is a large, open room where the nuns create various
text: gift items which the convent sells to support itself.
text: Several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand-painting
text: Christmas cards and making Christmas tree ornaments.
text: On the other side of the room is a large, free-standing
text: loom, which resembles a grand piano. The loom is wooden; a
text: tapestry is half-completed. Mary Patrick is seated at the
text: loom, which is a complicated mechanism. Christy stands
text: beside her.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: The minute I saw you. I said to myself,
dialog: she's a weaver. Have you ever used a
dialog: loom?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Not in years.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Well, it all comes back, in just a
dialog: jiffy. I'm working on a wall-hanging, of
dialog: the convent.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: To sell, of course. I hate to say it,
dialog: but we're in terrible trouble here at St.
dialog: Katherine's. We need a new roof, the
dialog: furnace is going, and there's no money.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: But don't you get money? From the
dialog: Vatican?
dialog: Page 44.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely
dialog: self-supporting. Like all convents. Like
dialog: yours.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Oh, right. At my old place, we used
dialog: to... wash cars. Groom dogs. So... nice
dialog: loom.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Isn't it lovely? Now I'll demonstrate,
dialog: and then you can hop right in.
text: (as she deftly works
dialog: the loom)
dialog: You just draw your beater in, keep it
text: pressed against the pick, and open the
dialog: shed. Then pass your shuttle, beat, and
text: open the next shed. Shuttle. beat, beat,
dialog: shuttle, beat, shed. Keep tension on the
dialog: warp. Is that clear?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (pretending to be
dialog: fascinated)
dialog: Just about. Show me again.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: You betcha.
scene_heading: CRAFTS ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
text: ANGLE on the wall hanging, which has progressed
dialog: considerably.
text: ANGLE on Christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing
dialog: through a magazine.
text: ANGLE on Mary Patrick, hard at work at the loom.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Shuttle, beat, shed. And watch your
text: heddles.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I love my heddles. Show me again.
text: Mother Superior appears.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving
dialog: progressing?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend
dialog: Mother -
dialog: Page 45.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
text: Really catching on.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the
text: office. Mary Clarence, carry on.
text: Mother Superior gestures to the loom. Christy sits at the
text: loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit.
text: Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her
text: face. She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick's
text: instructions. She cracks her knuckles, as if she were
text: about to play the piano. She grabs two parts of the loom,
text: at random. She moves these parts.
text: ANGLE on the loom. As a result of Christy's movements,
text: the loom collapses, piece by piece. The tapestry unravels,
text: the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus
text: disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and
text: falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Mother Superior is striding down the hall; she is livid.
text: Christy trails behind her, trying to keep up.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Months of work, and the loom, absolutely
dialog: ruined!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I
dialog: wasn't cut out to make little tapestries,
dialog: or knit little sweaters! I don't do that!
dialog: I'm a star!
text: Mother Superior stops dead in her tracks; she turns and
text: stares at Christy. Then she smiles, in a rather
dialog: frightening manner.
scene_heading: MONTAGE - CHRISTY
text: A)on her hands and knees. scrubbing the stone floor of a

speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Let me talk to Detective Eddie Mulcahy.
dialog: It's an emergency. Real bad.
speaker_heading: EDDIE'S VOICE
dialog: Mulcahy.
text: Christy cups her hand around the phone and speaks quietly
text: and frantically. INTERCUT between Christy and Eddie.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Not again. You can't keep calling.
dialog: Somebody's going to catch on to where you
dialog: are.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: But I'm going insane! All these people
dialog: do is pray and work, work and pray! I
dialog: don't get it -- when's the weekend? They
dialog: have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call
dialog: food! Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns!
text: I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray
dialog: five times a days Do you know what I
dialog: pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea?
dialog: Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall
dialog: off yet? Get me outta her!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Calm down. Look, I didn't want to tell
dialog: you this, but we've had some problems
dialog: with our protection program lately.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide
dialog: them, but there's a leak in the
text: department, and they end up dead.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You son-of-a-bitch!
dialog: Page 47
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I just need a few more weeks,
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: But it's a nightmare! Mother Superior
dialog: is out to get me! She hates my guts! She
dialog: keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
text: In the distance, Christy hears the CHOIR practicing; they
text: sound even worse than usual.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (holding the phone
dialog: out)
dialog: Do you hear that? That choir? Eddie,
dialog: in here, that's what they call music!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Don't call again. It's not safe. I'll
dialog: be in touch.
text: As the line goes dead, Mother Superior enters. Christy
text: takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver. She
text: sings as she works.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
text: THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF
dialog: MUSIC...
text: Still singing, Christy breezes out of the room. Mother
text: Superior looks mystified.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTY'S CELL - MIDNIGHT
text: Christy is lying flat out on her bed, in her habit,
text: utterly exhausted by the week's hard labor. There is a
text: meek SCRATCHING at her door.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (without moving)
dialog: Yeah?
text: Sister Mary Robert enters, very shyly. She barely looks
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What? What does she want now? I did
dialog: the dishes. I oiled the pews. I dusted
dialog: the hymnals. Two hundred hymnals. Why
dialog: can't people share?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (not speaking above a
dialog: whisper)
dialog: I... I...
dialog: Page 48.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: I... I brought you something.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: A cigarette?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: An extra heel of bread. Please take it,
dialog: you need your strength. You've been
dialog: working so hard.
text: Mary Robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown
dialog: bread. Christy takes it..
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Thanks. So which one are you? Sister
dialog: Bruce? Sister Doug?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (until almost
dialog: whispering)
dialog: Mary Robert. I'm... Mary Robert.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Right. Okay. Bob. Nice to know you.
text: Mary Robert nods, and resumes looking at her hands. She
text: doesn't 1eave, but she's still tongue-tied. Christy is at a
dialog: loss.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: So, Bob, how long have you been in? St.
dialog: K's?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Three years. Sister.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
text: Three years. A rookie.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: A novice.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY

dialog: when do you take the final vows?
text: Mary Robert bursts into tears.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Whoa! Bob! What's going on here?
dialog: What'd I say?
dialog: Page 49.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (still sobbing)
dialog: You have to help me
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are
dialog: they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they
dialog: drug you? Did Reverend Mother like,
dialog: kidnap your parents? We can call the
dialog: Enquirer.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: No, you don't understand -- I don't want
dialog: to get out! I want to get in?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy. I
dialog: want to take my final vows, I would do it
dialog: tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: She won't? Why not?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: She says I should wait. She says that
dialog: no one should become a nun as an escape
dialog: from life. She says that I'm not
dialog: experienced enough to make the decision
text: yet. In a mature manner.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: She said that? Reverend Mother?
text: Mary Robert nods, solemnly. Suddenly, from the streets
text: outside the convent, we hear a BLAST OF hot dance MUSIC,
text: and the SOUND of laughter and carefree conversation.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Well, then there's only one thing to do.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Reverend Mother says you need
dialog: experience, right, in life. In order to
dialog: make a responsible decision. This is
dialog: going to be very painful for me. You
dialog: know how much I love this little room.
dialog: This whole convent. Wait.
text: Christy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the
text: wall. She speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if Jesus
text: is advising her.
dialog: Page 50.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to Jesus)
dialog: Must I do this thing, 0 Lord? Please
dialog: help me.,. yes, I know... I must put my
dialog: selfish cares aside... I must think of
dialog: others... yes, she's here...
text: (she gestures to Mary
dialog: Robert)
dialog: He says hi... yes, I understand... let
dialog: thy will be done. Amen. You too.
text: Christy turns to Mary Robert, having received a holy
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: We must do this sacred thing, Mary
dialog: Robert.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Of course! We must do it! It's the
dialog: will of God! What is it?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (shutting her eyes,
dialog: for the full spiritual
dialog: effect)
dialog: We must... get you some experience. We
dialog: must... leave this place.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Are you sure?
text: Another BLAST OF MUSIC from the street. Christy turns to
text: the crucifix. She gets confirmation.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to Jesus)
dialog: We hear you.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: The outer wall of the convent. A door swings open, and
text: Christy sticks her head out. She looks both ways, and
text: steps outside. She beckons to Mary Robert, who appears
text: from behind her. Mary Robert looks very wary. Christy
text: pulls her along.
scene_heading: EXT. A STREET NEARBY
text: Christy and Mary Robert walk along a street a few blocks
text: from the convent.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (looking around
dialog: cautiously)
dialog: Are you sure this is what Reverend
dialog: Mother had in mind?
dialog: Page 51.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I know it is. It's life. Experience.
dialog: Take a deep breath.
text: Christy breathes deep, and then lets out a whoop. She
text: spins, letting her habit billow around her.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Mary Clarence!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Now you.
text: Mary Robert's eyes widen. She points to herself -- "Me?"
text: Christy nods. Mary Robert lets out a tiny little whoop,
text: and does a little, timid hop.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: It's a start.
scene_heading: EXT. SOCIAL CLUB
text: A neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer
text: signs. The exterior is colorfully painted; the club all
text: but explodes with good times. A group of teenagers lounge
text: on the steps, sipping beers and smoking. Among the
text: teenagers are the girls from Christy's Christian Youth
text: group. Christy and Mary Robert approach, and the group
text: falls silent.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: How are you doing.
speaker_heading: LAWANDA
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Hey, Sisters. Are you going in there?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You know it.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: We need experience.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (remembering she's a
dialog: nun)
dialog: It's part of St. Katherine's new
dialog: community outreach program. How old are
dialog: you? You shouldn't be smoking. Have you
dialog: ever seen a diseased lung? Hand 'em
dialog: over.
text: Lawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes. Christy
text: turns to a TEENAGE BOY who's drinking beer.
dialog: Page 52.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: And you, with the devil's brew passing
dialog: through your lips.
dialog: (holding out her hand)
dialog: A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
text: The boy hands over the beer. Christy and Mary Robert
text: enter the club.
scene_heading: INT. SOCIAL CLUB
text: Christy enters the club and grins. She takes a drag on
text: the cigarette. Mary Robert grabs the beer from Christy's
text: hand, and takes a swig.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Bobs
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Experience! Right?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Right.
text: The club is alive with activity; the bar is crowded,
text: couples are making out at small tables, and the dance floor
text: is packed. The atmosphere is a combination of hazy
dialog: darkness and colored lights; the club should have the
text: feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all
text: ages and races. The MUSIC percolates, and Christy starts
text: to move to it. She and Mary Robert find a table in the
text: corner, and signal a nearby waitress.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
text: A couple of bowls of chili.
dialog: (holding up the beer)
dialog: And another round of these.
text: The waitress looks at the two women strangely; the club
dialog: has never hosted nuns before.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (to the waitress,
dialog: confidentially)
dialog: I have to do this. So I can become a
dialog: nun.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to the waitress)
dialog: Initiation. You understand. Later on,
dialog: we make her wear her underwear on her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Really?
dialog: Page 53
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to the waitress)
dialog: And she wants to be a nun.
text: The waitress leaves, shaking her head. Christy and Mary
text: Robert watch the action at the club.
text: Across the room, MIKE the bartender stares at the nuns,
text: especially Christy; he tries to place her.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Who are all these people?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: This is your neighborhood. Your turf.
dialog: You should get to know 'em.
text: From across the room, Mike the bartender continues to
text: study Christy's face. He takes out a copy of Vince's fax
text: photo and stares at it. He covers Christy's hair in the
text: photo with his hands, creating a wimple. There is no
text: question in his mind; the two are the same. Mike has a
text: dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the
text: drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron.
text: There is a LIVE BAND on a small stage at one end of the
text: club. They start playing a hot dance number, and the club
text: really begins to cook, as the dance floor fills. Christy
text: and Mary Robert, both still seated, start to move with the
dialog: music.
text: A very good-looking LOCAL DUDE comes over to the nuns
text: table. He is clearly amused at their presence.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Hey, Sisters -- how you doin'?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (flirting)
dialog: Better now.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: How come they let you out? Out of that
dialog: convent place?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Time off. For bad behavior.
speaker_heading: DUDE
dialog: Oww! A nun havin' fun! I don't believe
dialog: it! It's good to have you ladies in this
dialog: fine establishment. So... anybody on the
dialog: move?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: I am.
dialog: Page 54.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Bob! What're you doing?
text: Mary Robert leads the Dude out onto the dance floor.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: I'm getting experience.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to the Dude)
dialog: You watch yourself!
text: Christy decides she'd better keep an eye on Mary Robert;
text: she grabs another DUDE, and heads for the dance floor.
text: As the music percolates, Christy and Mary Robert dance;
text: Christy is very hot, and Mary Robert picks up on her moves.
text: The CLUB PATRONS are delighted, and cheer as the nuns start
dialog: to get down.
speaker_heading: CLUB PATRON #1
dialog: Do it, Sisters!
speaker_heading: CLUB PATRON #2
dialog: Sway and pray!
text: As the song, and the nuns' exuberant dancing, peak, the
text: Club Patrons cheer, shouting "Hallelujah!" and "Amen!"
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Christy and Mary Robert are walking back to the convent.
text: They are both in very good spirits.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Those people are wonderful! Why don't
dialog: we ever see them in church?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Good point. Especially that dude you
dialog: were with. I'd like to see him down
dialog: front.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: Mary Clarence! You're so... different
dialog: from the other sisters. Sometimes,
dialog: well... sometimes you sound more like a
dialog: layperson.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Honey.
text: As the two women laugh together, they don't notice the car
text: that begins to follow them, creeping slowly forward with
text: its headlights out.
dialog: Page 55.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother
dialog: about all my experiences. I've learned
dialog: so much.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Well, you know, you don't have to tell
dialog: her everything. I mean, nothing really
dialog: happened. We just... took a walk.
text: The car's bright lights suddenly switch on, and the nuns
text: turn, startled. The car hurtles toward them. They scream,
text: and Christy grabs Mary Robert and throws her out of the
text: car's path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags.
text: Struggling to her feet, Christy sees the car go into
text: reverse, and then pull forward again. She sees a glint of
text: light reflect off a gun as the car's driver (Mike the
text: bartender) leans out the window.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to Mary Robert)
dialog: Run!
text: Christy shoves Mary Robert towards an alley. As she does
text: so, the gun GOES OFF with a red flash. The shot misses the
text: two women and SHATTERS a plate glass window of the store
text: behind them.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY
text: Running up the alley, Christy and Mary Robert hear Mike's
text: FOOTSTEPS chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Mary Clarence!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Keep moving!
text: Christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves Mary
text: Robert up the ladder ahead of her.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Climb! Now!
text: As Christy and Mary Robert climb the fire escape, another
text: GUNSHOT ECHOES in the alley, ricocheting off the fire
dialog: escape.
text: The nuns climb higher up the building. Mike pursues,
text: looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but
text: not finding any openings. He takes the steps two at a time
text: and begins to gain ground.
text: At the fourth floor landing, Christy's heel gets stuck in
text: the grating. She pulls frantically at the laces.
dialog: Page 56.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Goddamn it!
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Mary Clarence!
text: Mike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her
text: toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for
text: the gun. Mike's hand is knocked back against the metal
text: frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, RATTLING
text: down the metal steps to the landing below. Christy shoves
text: Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and
text: follows her in.
scene_heading: INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT
text: Christy and Mary Robert leap into the bedroom of an
text: Hispanic couple, their arms wrapped around each other in
text: bed. At the women's entrance, the couple looks up, stunned
text: to see two nuns in their bedroom.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Oh my Lord!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (pushing Mary Robert
dialog: forward)
dialog: Experience!
text: The couple continues to look stunned as the nuns race out
dialog: of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT - NIGHT
text: Christy and Mary Robert run up to the side door of the
text: convent; they catch their breath.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: What was all that? Who was that man?
dialog: Why would he shoot at us?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I don't know, some people just don't
dialog: like nuns. I wish I had a ruler.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: We could have been killed! But you
dialog: saved me!
dialog: (throwing her arms
dialog: around Christy)
dialog: Thank you, Mary Clarence!
text: The door to the convent swings open. Mother Superior is
dialog: waiting.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Yes -- thank you so much.
dialog: Page 57
scene_heading: INT.CONVENT CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Christy sits alone outside Mother Superior's office,
text: listening to the loud TICKING of the clock on the wall. She
text: seems small and vulnerable, like a child sent to the
dialog: principal's office.
text: The door opens and Eddie emerges from the office.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What'd she say?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You blew it -- big time. She doesn't
dialog: want you back.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Does she know people are trying to kill
dialog: me out there?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: She's counting on it. She's concerned
dialog: for your safety, but she wants me to try
dialog: and find another convent that will take
dialog: you. Or a carnival.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: So what am I supposed to do in the
dialog: meantime?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Go in and talk to her. It can't hurt.
dialog: (urging her)
dialog: Go.
text: Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door. She
text: looks at Eddie, who motions her to go in. She finally
dialog: does.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE
text: Mother Superior is working on some papers at her desk as
text: Christy enters. Christy is trying to figure out a
dialog: strategy.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: So... hi there.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (not amused and not
dialog: looking up)
dialog: I don't believe we have anything to say
text: to each other.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm
dialog: incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I
dialog: wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would
dialog: happen!
dialog: Page 58.
text: Mother Superior glances up from her work. She is
text: justifiably outraged.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your
dialog: behavior was inexcusable!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I know! I'm sorry I didn't mean for
dialog: it to happen! And I was the one they
dialog: were shooting at!
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Mary Clarence, I have given you every
dialog: opportunity. To change. To make a
dialog: decent life for yourself.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A
dialog: janitor?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Clearly, you have learned nothing. And
dialog: you present an ongoing threat, both to
dialog: this convent and to yourself.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: But you can't kick me out! Guys want to
dialog: kill me! You're a nun! A big nun!
dialog: Aren't you supposed to have compassion?
dialog: For the wayward sheep? I mean, I'm a
dialog: major sinner! All-time great! Hall of
dialog: Fame! Aren't I, like, your dream come
dialog: true? Your Olympic event?
text: Mother Superior stares at Christy.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: I am?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: You may stay. But I shall restrict your
dialog: activities to but a single task.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (with great dread)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: You have, I believe, some minimal
dialog: background in music. Therefore, you are
dialog: to join our choir.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Page 59
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: You will sing, and you will sleep,' that
dialog: is your schedule until you depart. As
dialog: almost no one attends Mass, you will be
text: unable to cause further damage.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: No. No.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You're my Olympic event.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Not the choir, please, anything but
dialog: that. The choir -- I mean, have you
dialog: heard them? I'll do anything, scrub
dialog: floors, toilets, you name it, but not
dialog: that I
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (in triumph)
dialog: The choir, Mary Clarence. Go for the
dialog: gold.
scene_heading: INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - THAT DAY
text: There are twelve nuns in the room, going over sheet music.
text: Mary Lazarus is the group's leader; Mary Patrick and Mary
text: Robert are also in the choir. Christy appears at the door,
text: grimacing.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Is this... choir practice?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell.
text: Christy spots Mary Robert.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last
dialog: night...
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Now stop that. You didn't shoot at me.
dialog: You were only trying to help, to give me
dialog: experience. I tried to explain that to
dialog: Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if
dialog: she understood.
text: Mary Lazarus cuts off this chitchat, thrusting a hymnal at
dialog: Christy.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: Soprano or alto?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (very gloomy)
dialog: Whatever.
dialog: Page 60.
text: Mary Lazarus hands Christy a hymnal, and raps her baton.
text: The choir begins to sing; Christy doesn't even bother
text: trying. She is horrified; the choir is the worst-sounding
text: group in history. They seem to be singing in several
text: random keys, and they even have trouble with the words. No
text: one looks up from their hymnals. Sister Alma, the organist
text: with the hearing aid, is plodding along.
scene_heading: INT. BLUE COLLAR BAR - DAY
text: Mike the bartender is taking chairs off tables and setting
text: them on the floor as Joey and Willy enter.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: We're looking for Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You found him -- but we're not open yet.
text: Willy grabs Mike's arms and bends them behind his back.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey -- the till's empty!
text: Willy slams Mike's face into the wall, stunning him. Joey
text: lifts Mike's groggy face and offers sympathy.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Who are you guys?
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: We're the guys from Vegas. You had
dialog: Christy last night, but you let her get
text: away. It's upsetting.
text: Willy hammers Mike's face into the wall again.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But you didn't tell me!
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: We didn't tell you what?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That she's a nun! That chick you're
dialog: looking for -- she's a nun!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What? Christy?
dialog: Page 61.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: A nun?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm telling you!
text: Willy and Joey look at each other, and consider this.
text: Then they burst out laughing. They refuse to believe
dialog: Mike's story.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Gimme a hand here.
text: Willy and Joey pick Mike up, and hurl him over the bar.
text: Then they exit, still laughing.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: A nun!
scene_heading: INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY
text: The choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn
text: Let Thy Thoughts He Guided. Christy is not singing; she
text: is clearly in pain. Mary Lazarus stops the song. One of
text: the nuns has to nudge Sister Alma to stop her playing.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: Mary Clarence, are you with us?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Um, I don't really know this one...
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Mary Clarence has a background in music.
dialog: That's what Reverend Mother said.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: Really, Mary Clarence? Were you a
dialog: choirmistress?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Sure. Kind of... free-lance.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: (circling Christy)
dialog: Free-lance? Oh really? You think I
dialog: don't see? You think I took vows
dialog: yesterday? I know what you're up to. You
dialog: and Reverend Mother.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: You're a ringer. She brought you in to
dialog: replace me. Out with the old.
dialog: Page 62.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Hold on.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Mary Clarence, could you? Mary Lazarus,
dialog: you're terrific, but...
dialog: (to Christy)
dialog: Could you help us?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER NUN
dialog: Please?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER NUN
dialog: You've heard us.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: Well.
text: Everyone falls silent. Mary Lazarus walks across the
text: room, eyeballing each member of the choir.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: There's a word for this -- mutiny.
dialog: (to Christy)
dialog: So, Mary Clarence, you think you can do
dialog: better. I believe I'd like to see that.
dialog: (she hands Christy her
dialog: pitchpipe and baton)
dialog: I'm out to pasture. Dry dock. The glue
dialog: factory. Go ahead, Sister -- make 'em
dialog: sing.
text: Everyone watches Christy.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Well...
dialog: (to Nary Lazarus)
dialog: With all due respect... let's have a
dialog: look at this.
text: Christy goes over to the piano. She examines the sheet
text: music for "Let They Thoughts He Guided." She sits at the
text: piano, beside Sister Alma. Christy picks out the hymn on
text: the piano, accompanying herself.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
text: LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
text: LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
text: Christy's singing voice is, as usual, not very good. She
text: stops singing. For perhaps the first time in her life, she
dialog: has really heard herself.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Man. I sound like you guys.
dialog: Page 63.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: (victorious)
dialog: Very nice. Sisters, have we learned our
dialog: lesson? I won't hold this little episode
dialog: against anyone. I'll try not to.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Mary Robert.
text: Mary Robert jumps, startled by the attention.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Mary Robert, I've watched you. You
dialog: never really sing. You whisper. Nothing
text: comes out.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: I don't want to mess anyone up...
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to Sister Alma)
dialog: Give me a C.
dialog: (because Sister Alma
dialog: is hard of hearing)
dialog: A C!
text: Sister Alma plays the note. Christy points the baton at
text: Mary Robert. Mary Robert whispers the note.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Louder! Like you're onstage.
text: Mary Robert sings a little louder.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Like people are eating, and there's
dialog: silverware, and you want them to hear
dialog: you.
text: Mary Robert sings louder still.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Think about that guy you were dancing
dialog: with!
text: Mary Robert finally lets out her full voice, which is huge
text: and glorious. After singing a single perfect note, she
text: stops abruptly; she has scared herself.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Oh my!
dialog: Page 64.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You see? We've got the voices. They're
dialog: just allover the place. I've heard all of
dialog: you, in the shower --you're decent.
dialog: Better than me. We just need charts --
dialog: harmony -- chops.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Chops?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: The goods. The sound. The sale. Let's
dialog: rearrange a few things. Mary Patrick,
dialog: you re not a natural soprano, you're an
dialog: alto. Get over here. Mary Robert --with
dialog: the sopranos.
text: The two nuns trade places.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Sister Alma -- a C.
text: Sister Alma plays the note, and the nuns try to duplicate
dialog: it, but the results aren't much better than before. Christy
text: uses her pitchpipe; she circulates among the nuns, giving
text: each her note, urging them closer to pitch.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Middle section, hold that note, for dear
dialog: life. Sopranos, an A. Sister Alma?
text: Sister Alma hits the note. Christy shuffles a couple of
text: more nuns to other sections, then gets a third note going
text: with the altos, using her pitchpipe.
text: For one moment, the nuns all realize they are singing a
text: perfect chord. They are elated.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: We did it! We actually sang a chord!
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (thrilled and
dialog: disconcerted)
dialog: That was exciting!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Yeah, for one second. That was the
dialog: blend -- you've got to listen to each
dialog: other. Be a group.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: I knew that.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you
dialog: like discipline. Hard work.
dialog: Page 65.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: Of course. I'm a nun. Four Popes now.
dialog: The Lord hates a loafer.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I hear you. How many days a week do you
dialog: rehearse?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
text: Two days. An hour or so.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: No way. We're a choir, right?
dialog: Headliners. The big room. Two days a
dialog: week won't cut it. Every day.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: She's good.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (to Christy)
dialog: Do you really think we could do it? Get
dialog: better?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I don't know. Mary Lazarus, what do you
dialog: think? They're pretty raw.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
text: Wet behind the ears.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: A bunch of real mama's girls.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Oh, please? Can't we try?
text: Christy and Mary Lazarus look at each other, as real
text: comrades. Christy leans on Mary Lazarus' shoulder.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: It'll be hell.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: Tell me about it.
text: Christy and Mary Lazarus shake hands, firmly. Christy
text: turns to the choir, very businesslike.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Ten-hut!
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY
text: This is a basement utility room. A large industrial
text: washer-dryer stands along one wall; the machine makes a
scene_heading: repetitive CHUNG-CHUNG sound
dialog: Page 66.
text: The choir nuns are busily doing laundry; some iron, others
text: fold sheets, others stack towels and garments on a long

speaker_heading: CHRISTY
text: It's a rhythm section. The beat.

speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Mary Patrick -- do you remember the

speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK

speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Am I?

speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: (as a confession)
dialog: All right, I am, I know it! All my
dialog: life, I've just been... upbeat.
text: Optimistic. Perky. I can't help it.
dialog: Even when I was little, I remember my
dialog: mother used to say, "That child is pure
dialog: sunshine. She'll either be a nun -- or a
dialog: stewardess."
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: So use it. When we sing hymns, they're
dialog: usually about rejoicing, right?
dialog: Celebration. Most music is. So don't

dialog: into your voice. Make me happy. Let me
dialog: hear it. Perk out. Perk down.

speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
text: GOING TO THE CHAPEL OF LOVE!
text: The nuns have really gotten into the song, with Christy
text: encouraging them verbally. They are sounding better and
dialog: better.
text: SISTER MARY FREDERICK, a member of the choir, steps into
text: the laundry room and lets loose with a sudden, piercing
text: whistle. The nuns immediately stop singing, and a moment
text: later Mother Superior enters.
text: The room is quiet except for the sound of the washer-

speaker_heading: NUNS
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: Good morning, Reverend Mother.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR

scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Lawanda and her friends glance at the convent with
text: curiosity as the beautiful MUSIC drifts out to the street.
text: A few other heads turn, but with only mild reactions.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL
text: At the end of the first verse, Christy signals the choir
text: to stop. There's a hush in the chapel as Christy glances
text: at the vacant pews. Then she turns to Sister Alma and
text: nods. Sister Alma strikes a bold, stirring chord.
text: Several of the nuns blink. Bishop O'Hara glances at the
text: organ with surprise. Mother Superior sits up with a
text: stiffened back and a severe expression.
text: As the chord grows in force, Christy gives the choir a
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: One, two, three...
text: The choir begins a radically new version of the same hymn.

dialog: in.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Sister Alma!
text: Sister Alma, inspired by Christy and the choir, burns up
text: the organ with a solo. More people from the street begin
text: to enter; tentative, curious, drawn by the music.
text: At the end of the solo, Christy makes a gesture to the

text: happier than she has in years.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: The members of the choir are all gathered outside Mother

speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls?
dialog: This is not a theater. or a casino.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: Exactly. People like going to theaters

dialog: for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack
dialog: the joint.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Through blasphemy? You have corrupted
dialog: the entire choir!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Hold on. That's not fair. I worked
text: hard with them. They gave up their free
dialog: time, and they loved it. Those women are
dialog: happy. And we can get even better. We
dialog: can wake this place up.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Out of the question.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Please let me try. I'm begging you.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: And I am refusing. As of tomorrow, Mary
dialog: Lazarus will resume her leadership of
dialog: the choir.
text: Christy is crestfallen. There is a KNOCK on the door, and
text: O'Hara enters. The other members of the choir are in

speaker_heading: BISHOP O'HARA
dialog: Reverend Mother, I just wanted to
dialog: congratulate you.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: BISHOP O'HARA

speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Well... thank you.

speaker_heading: BISHOP O'HARA
dialog: I can't wait until next Sunday, when the

dialog: people walk right in from the street?
dialog: That music, that heavenly music -- it
dialog: called to them.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Perhaps.
speaker_heading: BISHOP O'HARA
dialog: I must tell the Cardinal. I.11 send him
dialog: a personal letter, describing your

dialog: your little convent alive.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Really?
text: Christy has just been eating this up with a spoon.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Excuse me, Bishop. Reverend Mother has
dialog: some other ideas too. She's too modest
dialog: to talk about it, but she thinks we
dialog: should get out of the convent and into
dialog: the neighborhood more.
text: (putting her hands on
dialog: Mother Superior's
dialog: shoulders)
dialog: This woman.
text: Mary Patrick jumps forward.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Bless her! There are so many problems

speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (confused by the turn
dialog: things have taken)
dialog: Really...
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (with regard to Mother
dialog: Superior)
dialog: You know Reverend Mother. Hides her

speaker_heading: BISHOP O'HARA
dialog: (to Mother Superior)
dialog: You're a pioneer.

speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this

speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: And you'll face that danger head-on. As

scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT - DAY
text: The nuns are out in force, painting the walls of the

text: shining suns. The CAMERA PANS to Christy, who is adding
text: her own original touch to the mural, using cans of spray
text: paint. Christy's section includes an image of a nun in a
text: miniskirt and spike heels, accompanied by neon letters that
text: read "St. Kate!" People gather in the street, watching the
text: nuns' activities. The convent begins to crackle with
dialog: energy and life.

scene_heading: INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S WINDOW
text: From the window of her office, Mother Superior watches the

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATER

scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY
text: The rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir
text: is separated into several groups. Christy has got the
text: whole thing running like a disciplined Broadway cast.
text: Mary Patrick leads one group in the corner as they
text: practice synchronized movements with tambourines. Colorful
text: streamers are tied to the tambourines, and they make

text: Sister Alma pounds the piano with newfound energy, as Mary

dialog: they've only dreamed of in the past.
text: Christy and Mary Lazarus have corralled the rest of the

dialog: Page 75.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: We're here to pray for you, brother.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: What? Get the hell out of here.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: We know you don't want to sell drugs.
dialog: You just had an unhappy childhood, and
dialog: maybe a learning disability. You just
dialog: need someone to pray for you.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: We know you don't want to bring pain and
dialog: misery to your friends and neighbors.
dialog: We'll pray to find you some honest work.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: And we know that, even though most
dialog: people would call you a leech and a
dialog: parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We
dialog: know that deep down inside, you're
dialog: probably even worse. And so you truly
dialog: need our prayers.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: What is this? Outta my way!
text: The nuns give him room, and the Driver zips off down the

speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers

text: The Dealer's eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his

speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Are you going to shoot us all, tough
dialog: guy?
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: Is it worth it? A lot of witnesses
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to the crowd)
dialog: Can I get a witness?
text: The Dealer glances at the surly crowd, then gives the nuns
text: a disgusted look. He puts the gun away.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: So I'll find another neighborhood to do
dialog: my business. You can' t stop me.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: If we can stop you here, they can stop
dialog: you there.
text: The Dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger.
text: The crowd APPLAUDS and CHEERS.
text: The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice
text: of a NEWS REPORTER.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER (V.0.)
dialog: It was a truly remarkable scene, as the
dialog: nuns from St. Katherine's literally drove
dialog: the crack dealers from the neighborhood,
text: led by the feisty Sister Mary Clarence.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see a TV screen with an image of

text: sour face.
dialog: Page 77.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: What? Nuns? You got me in here to see

speaker_heading: CONNIE
dialog: Look -- she's adorable!

scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Eddie is cooking spaghetti in his efficiency apartment and
text: watching the NEWS on TV at the same time. He pours himself
text: a glass of wine and stirs the spaghetti sauce.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER
dialog: This tiny convent has experienced an
dialog: amazing turnaround. The sisters have
dialog: revitalized and taken back their
dialog: neighborhood, all due to the energy and
text: talent of the convent choir, a group led
dialog: by this gifted young nun. Tell us, Mary
dialog: Clarence1 what makes you so special?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (trying to appear
dialog: modest and nun-like)
dialog: Oh, I'm not special, Bob. It's just

scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT - DAY
text: The Sunday morning bell is CHIMING as crowds of people

scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL HALLWAY
text: Last in line, Christy follows the other choir members down

scene_heading: INT. CELL
text: Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself,
text: but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie.
dialog: Page 78.
text: Eddie releases her, and she falls onto the bed.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Eddie! You scared the hell out of me!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What if I was Vince? You'd be dead
dialog: right now. What are you doing giving

speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: It wasn't my fault! They just showed

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're supposed to be hiding out!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I really can't talk about it now. The

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Listen to yourself. This isn't a career

speaker_heading: CHRISTY

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're... you're a nun.
text: Eddie and Christy jump apart, their intimacy has

speaker_heading: CHRISTY

scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL
text: Sister Alma plays the organ, and the choir hums quietly as
text: Christy addresses the congregation. Cameras from several
text: TV stations are focussed on her from various places in the
dialog: chapel.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
text: This Sunday's hymn is inspired by the
dialog: lesson of Mary Magdalene. You know the
dialog: one. Mary Magdalene was a young lady
dialog: with a past. She was no stranger to sin.
dialog: She was no stranger to practically
dialog: everybody. Many condemned her. The
dialog: whole neighborhood. But one man refused
dialog: to do so. One man said, hey now, wait a
dialog: minute. Listen to the story.
text: Sister Alma starts playing a doo-wop vamp. Mary Patrick

scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT

text: approaches.
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: Better and better, Sisters, you are
dialog: truly an inspiration. And I bear
text: gladsome tidings.
text: The choir gathers around O'Hara with curiosity.
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: I've kept the Cardinal informed of your
text: progress in the neighborhood. He has
dialog: been most impressed. And he has invited
dialog: you to attend a special evening Mass at
dialog: St. Matthew's Cathedral on Sunday night1
dialog: to sing for the Council of Cardinals.
text: The choir reacts with an excited buzz: "The Council of
dialog: Cardinals!", "What shall we sing?", etc.
text: Mother Superior appears, from the center aisle.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: That is indeed glorious news, Bishop. We
dialog: will be honored to appear.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Page 83.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: And on such an occasion, I feel a
dialog: completely traditional program will be
dialog: best.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: The council of Cardinals is perhaps the
dialog: most esteemed body in the entire Catholic
dialog: church. They command the utmost respect.
dialog: Your more... secular entertainment would
dialog: be wholly out of place.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves
dialog: our new style.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: It's brought people back to the church.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Isn't that why we were asked to sing for
dialog: those Cardinals?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: I believe this can be settled by a
dialog: simple vote.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: A vote?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Of course. Mary Clarence, a convent is
dialog: not a totalitarian state. Most major
dialog: decisions are made by the membership as a
dialog: whole. A membership that, I am certain,
dialog: will vote in a rational and pious manner.
dialog: All those in favor of allowing Mary
dialog: Clarence to select a program?
text: All the nuns look at one another. Then, slowly, one by
text: one, they all raise their hands.
dialog: Mother Superior is pure steel at this moment; her
text: expression betrays no emotion. Christy, on the other hand,
dialog: is quite confused.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: But... wait a minute...
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: The majority has spoken.
dialog: Page 84.
speaker_heading: BISHOP O'HARA
dialog: Reverend Mother, as always, you are a
dialog: true leader. Gracious and understanding.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: It will be wonderful, Reverend Mother.
dialog: You'll see.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: (gesturing to Christy)
dialog: She's a pro.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: I am certain the presentation will be a
dialog: great success. Congratulations, Mary
dialog: Clarence. And congratulations to you
dialog: all.
text: The nuns cheer, and cluster around Christy, chattering
text: about the upcoming concert, as Mother Superior strides off.
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Seated at her desk, Mother Superior glances up as Christy
text: enters.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You sent for me?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: You have a phone call.
text: Mother Superior continues with her paperwork as Christy
text: picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: EDDIE'S VOICE
dialog: Good news, kid. I pulled a few strings
dialog: the judge has agreed to move the trial
dialog: up. We'll be in court in a couple of
dialog: days.
text: With mixed emotions, Christy speaks softly.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: That soon?
text: Mother Superior is a very interested eavesdropper.
speaker_heading: EDDIE'S VOICE
dialog: Forty-eight hours -- and you'll be a
dialog: free woman.
dialog: Page 85.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Great. That's good to hear.
speaker_heading: EDDIE'S VOICE
dialog: Hey, don't thank me or anything.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Right, right -- thanks.
text: Christy hangs up the phone. She looks at Mother Superior.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Hey -- your prayers have been answered.
dialog: I'm leaving. In just a couple of days.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Really. Well, that makes two of us.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: I have submitted my resignation to
dialog: Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked
dialog: to be relocated as soon as possible.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: But -- why?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: I must go where I can be of use.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: But -- there's so much more to do right
dialog: here. And look, if it's about me, I
dialog: mean, I'm gone.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Indeed. After how long? A few weeks?
dialog: I have been here thirty years. And yet,
dialog: it would seem, I know nothing.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: But everything that's happening is good!
dialog: You can be a part of it!
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is
dialog: one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into
dialog: town and declare a holiday. You have
dialog: raised the Sisters' expectations, you
dialog: have excited and confused them. They
dialog: imagine this neighborhood to be some sort
text: of delightful ongoing block party.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Page 86.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: You and I know that life is not so
dialog: simple. There will be disappointments.
dialog: Rude shocks. And you will have vanished.
dialog: How... fortunate.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Okay, so I just got things started. But
dialog: you could build on that. You could keep
dialog: it going.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: I am sorry, Mary Clarence. I seem to
dialog: have misplaced my tambourine. Good day,
dialog: Mary Clarence.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Good day.
text: Christy, frustrated, leaves the room. Mother Superior
text: looks up, she is truly torn, a proud woman unsure of her
dialog: choices.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT - NIGHT
text: The moon casts shafts of silver light down to the
text: courtyard of the convent. Most of the lights in the
dialog: neighborhood are out at this late hour.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY'S VOICE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Come on... I've got a surprise...
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle
text: carried by Christy. Three more candles appear, carried by
text: Mary Robert, Mary Patrick and Mary Lazarus. The door to
text: the freezer opens, and light spills out. Christy removes
text: several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the
dialog: nuns.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: Ice cream!
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have.
dialog: Where did you get this?
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: It's a sin. It's a wicked indulgence.
dialog: Is this butter almond?
dialog: Page 87.
text: Christy and the nuns sit on stools, enjoying their ice
text: cream by candlelight.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: It's contraband. Don't ask. But I
dialog: wanted to give you a treat. A sort of...
dialog: thank-you gift.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: A thank-you? For what? You're the one
dialog: we should be thanking.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: Is there any syrup?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't
dialog: always... real popular. I was sort of
dialog: selfish and... not real helpful. Okay,
dialog: I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun.
dialog: But now, thanks to all of you... maybe
dialog: I'm shaping up.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Mary Clarence, don't be silly. You're
dialog: an example to us all. You've taught us
dialog: so much. We're singing for the
dialog: Cardinals, and then -- who knows? Maybe
dialog: the choir can travel -- to schools, and
dialog: nursing homes.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Maybe we can get some of the local kids
dialog: to sing with us.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: We could cut a demo. Look for a label.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (knowing she has to
dialog: leave)
dialog: That's true, wouldn't that be great. Of
dialog: course, we never know when things are
dialog: going to change. Any one of us could be
dialog: transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Are you leaving us?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: Oh no. We'll always be together.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: That's what Diana Ross said.
dialog: Page 88.
text: Christy and the nuns qiggle, and continue eating their ice
text: cream, in a spirit of true friendship.
text: Mother Superior watches this scene, hidden in the shadows
text: by the door to the kitchen. She has begun to see Christy
text: in a new light. She looks thoughtful, and walks off.
scene_heading: INT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
text: Tate sits at his desk in the detective room, reading the
text: sports section. HENRY PARKER, the accountant for the
text: police department, looks stressful as he enters the room
text: and heads for Eddie's glassed-in office. Tate glances up
text: as Parker passes his desk.
speaker_heading: TATE
dialog: You're too late. Mulcahy just left.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I need his signature on some things.
dialog: They can't be processed without it.
speaker_heading: TATE
dialog: Leave 'em. He'll sign 'em later.
text: Parker looks annoyed -- he doesn't like deviations from
text: procedure -- but after a moment of indecision, he sets the
text: file folder on Tate's desk and walks away.
text: Tate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside. Bored,
text: looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and
text: glances at its contents; routine money vouchers for
text: equipment, supplies, etc. Tate is about to close the
text: folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye.
speaker_heading: TATE
dialog: What the hell is this...?
text: He examines a money voucher for a generous donation to St.
text: Katherine's Convent in San Francisco. It only takes a
text: moment to put two and two together, and Tate scrambles for
text: his phone and dials a number.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Henry Parker waits for the elevator. When it opens, he's
text: surprised to see Eddie step out.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Tate said you were gone.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I get all the way down to my car, and,
dialog: of course -- where are the keys?
dialog: Page 89.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I left the money vouchers with him. He
dialog: said you'd sign them in the morning.
text: Eddie nods and moves on as Parker enters the elevator.
text: After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed. He
text: picks up his pace. A little panicky, he begins to jog
text: toward the squad room.
scene_heading: INT. VINCE'S OFFICE
text: Vince is on the telephone. He signals Joey and Willy, and
text: they move quickly toward him.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: This is it. Get ready to move. No
dialog: mistakes. Grab her, get her to the
text: Moonlight. We meet there, and we take
dialog: care of her.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: We're on it. Give me the address.
text: Vince begins to write down the address.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD ROOM
text: Tate is hunched over the telephone, talking quietly with
text: his back to the rest of the room. The voucher for St.
text: Katherine's is in his hand as Eddie moves quickly toward
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: TATE
dialog: St. Katherine's Convent on East Barton.
dialog: It's gotta be the place.
text: Tate hangs up the phone and BOOM! Eddie hits him from
text: behind like a linebacker, drilling him to the floor. Other
text: detectives look up from their desks with confusion and
text: alarm. Eddie pins Tate to the wall and snatches the
text: voucher from his hand.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch!
text: Clarkson and another detective restrain Eddie before he
text: can hit Tate.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Get him out of here! Downstairs, in the
dialog: cell! I want his ass locked up now!
text: Nobody dares even question Eddie at this moment, and two
text: detectives drag Tate away. Eddie grabs Tate's phone and
text: dials long distance.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Clarkson, get on the other line. Call
dialog: Frisco Central. Tell 'em to get two
text: squad cars outside St. Katherine's
dialog: convent, and stop anybody with an out-of-
dialog: state license plate from getting near the
dialog: place.
text: Clarkson dials quickly. Eddie listens to Tate's telephone
text: as it RINGS and RINGS and RINGS.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT - DAY
text: All the nuns are in the chapel as the choir rehearses a
text: hymn, along with Gina and her girlfriends. Those who are
text: not in the choir clap their hands in rhythm. War in the
text: background, we can hear the telephone RINGING.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Eddie's police car streaks past an entrance ramp with the
text: SIREN screaming. It blazes through traffic, weaving in and
text: out at breakneck speeds. A moment later, Joey and Willy
text: pull onto the highway at a fast rate. The race is on, with
text: Eddie securely in the lead.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT - DAY
text: In the rehearsal room, the choir members are putting on
text: their robes. Christy and several nuns are all trying to
text: primp in front of one small mirror.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: The Council of Cardinals! I'm so
dialog: nervous! What if I forget the words?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Right to Hell. Just kidding. Where is
dialog: that bus?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: It should be here any minute.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: (with a clipboard)
dialog: Dress rehearsal at four, performance at
dialog: 8:30. Sharp.
text: Christy looks out the window, but sees no bus.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Eddie's police car streaks toward L.A.
dialog: Page 91.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT - DAY
text: The neighborhood has turned out to see the choir off.
text: Banners hang from the fire escapes of the building across
text: the street: "ST. KATE'S - THE GREATEST!", "GOOD LUCK
dialog: TONIGHT!"
text: A Catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in
text: front. Several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry
text: onto the bus. A moment later, Eddie's police car streaks
text: up to the side entrance of the convent, parking around the
text: corner from the bus.
scene_heading: INT. CONVENT
text: Eddie runs into the convent and finds Mother Superior at
text: the bottom of the stairs.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Reverend Mother! Quick! Where's
dialog: Christy?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: They know she's here! They're on their
dialog: way!
text: Mother Superior points up the stairs.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: The rehearsal room!
text: Mother Superior looks alarmed as Eddie takes the stairs
text: two at a time.
scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM
text: Looking out the window, Mary Robert sees the bus.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: It's here! Let's go!
text: Everyone makes a final check of their appearance, and then
text: the group leaves the room to head for the bus. Mary Robert
text: and Mary Patrick are the last to leave, except for Christy.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Hurry, Sister!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Get moving. I'm right behind you.
text: Christy primps in the mirror one last time, then leaves
text: the room. She is puzzled to suddenly see Eddie running
text: toward her from a side staircase.
dialog: Page 92.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Eddie...?
text: Eddie grabs her hand and pulls her toward the side
dialog: staircase.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Vince knows you're here.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (shocked and scared)
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Long story. His goons will be here any
dialog: minute. We've got to get you out of here
dialog: '- now!
text: Christy and Eddie hurry down the steps to the side
text: entrance, and she almost trips on her choral robes. Eddie
text: opens the door and starts outside, but Christy stops in her
dialog: tracks.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I can't go with you.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's
dialog: Cathedral. We're singing for the
dialog: Cardinals.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if
dialog: you don't get your ass out of here!
text: Eddie jerks her hand, and Christy follows him reluctantly
text: to the car.
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S CAR
text: Eddie takes off at a fast clip up the street. As the car
text: cruises through an intersection, Christy looks back at the
text: bus with confusion and sadness. She sees the other nuns
text: rushing back into the convent to look for her.
scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL ROOM
text: Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic
text: in their eyes.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Mary Clarence! Sister!
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
text: It's no use. She just isn't here.
dialog: Page 93.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: It doesn't make any sense. She was
dialog: right behind me...
text: The HORN on the school bus blows loudly down in the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: We can't sing without her! What should
dialog: we do?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: (calming herself)
dialog: We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
text: The nuns are calmed by the tone of Mary Patrick's voice.
text: They leave the room to join the others on the bus.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Eddie's police car streaks through crowded streets.
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S CAR
text: Christy still looks unsettled.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Eddie -- I've got to go back. They
dialog: won't sing without me. I'm deserting
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I think they'd understand.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: That's not the point! They need me!
text: Eddie glances at her, impressed by the influence the
dialog: convent has had.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: They need you? A bunch of nuns? For
dialog: what? Moral guidance? Make-up tips?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You don't get it! It's a big thing for
dialog: them, it's like... Caesar's Palace.
text: Prime-time. They're singing for the
dialog: Cardinals. It's like... "Star Search."
dialog: If first prize was a trip to the Vatican.
dialog: They've worked really hard, they deserve
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (goading her)
dialog: Nuns?
dialog: Page 94.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: They're not nuns. They're like..
text: people. With one outfit.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT - DAY
text: Joey and Willy park their car in front of the convent, get
text: out quickly and climb the steps to the front door. They
text: ring the bell.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: So that guy in the bar was right? She's
dialog: like... some kind of nun?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Yeah, right -- when I see it.
text: Lawanda and her friends watch Joey and Willy pounding on
text: the convent door.
speaker_heading: LAWANDA
dialog: You dudes looking for nuns? They all
dialog: went to St. Matthew's.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: St, Matthew's? Thanks.
speaker_heading: LAWANDA
dialog: Praise the Lord.
text: Joey and Willy run past the girls, get into their car and
dialog: take off.
scene_heading: INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY
text: Eddie glances at the dashboard and sees that the fuel
text: gauge is close to empty. He wheels into a gas station and
text: pulls up to the tanks. Christy starts to open the door,
text: but he stops her.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Even nuns have to pee.
text: He lets her go, then gets out to pump gas.
scene_heading: INT. WOMEN'S ROOM
text: Christy enters the bathroom; it is deserted. She fondles
text: her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees. This position
text: doesn't work for her; she stands. She looks around her;
text: she glances up, toward heaven. She decides to do things
text: simply, and speaks in a matter-of-fact tone.
dialog: Page 95.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Okay, it's me. Mary Clarence. Christy.
dialog: It's Chris Carter. I need some help
dialog: here. I can't believe I'm doing this.
dialog: Okay, look, I know I should just get back
dialog: in the car, and get the hell out of here.
dialog: Save my skin. I mean, it's not wrong,
dialog: Vince really wants to kill me. Why do you
dialog: make guys like Vince? But if I don't
dialog: sing at St. Matthew's... Mary Robert.
dialog: Mary Patrick. It means so much to them.
dialog: They're counting on me -- and I like
dialog: that. Maybe Reverend Mother is right,
dialog: maybe I am a bad influence, maybe I'm
dialog: just some Vegas slut, but... can we cut a
dialog: deal here? I mean, I still don't believe
dialog: in, like, most of the Commandments, and
dialog: stuff in church still gives me the
dialog: willies, but -- if I go back and sing, if
dialog: I do a good deed, will you promise I
dialog: won't get killed? All I want is a sign.
text: Lightning. Thunder. Anything.
text: Suddenly, Christy hears the toilet FLUSH in the next
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (in disbelief)
dialog: No. No. Doesn't count...
text: Suddenly, Christy hears "AVE MARIA" coming from a radio or
text: TV outside the bathroom. She looks up; a ray of sunlight
text: illuminates a grimy, dime-store Christmas tree ornament
text: hanging from a room deodorizer. The ornament is a glittery
text: angel; it sparkles in the light.
text: Christy leaves the bathroom, still not quite sure.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION
text: Christy looks through the grimy window of the gas station
text: office. A bored Mechanic is watching a small portable TV.
text: On the TV is an episode of "THE FLYING NUN": Sally Field,
text: in full habit, is soaring along.
text: Suddenly, Christy hears the loud ROAR of a motorcycle
text: starting up over by one of the gas pumps. The BIKER turns
text: and looks at Christy: he has long hair, and a beard and
text: moustache, and he looks, well, a bit like Jesus.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Oh my God...
text: Christy runs up to the Biker..
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I'm late for church. Can I get a lift?
dialog: Page 96.
text: Christy swings onto the back seat; the Biker puts his
text: Harley in gear and flies down the street. Eddie is shocked
text: as he drops some money on the ground and jumps into his car
dialog: to follow.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL - DAY
text: We see a network truck parked in front of the landmark
dialog: cathedral.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL
text: There is a sense of chaos in the chapel as TECHNICIANS set
text: up television equipment, and Mother Superior leads the
text: choir as it rehearses. Near the back of the chapel, Bishop
text: O'Hara looks concerned over the performance of the choir. A
text: CARDINAL walks up to Bishop O'Hara.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL
dialog: Is this the choir you've been speaking
dialog: so highly of, Bishop?
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: They're just a bit nervous. They'll be
dialog: fine.
text: The choir seems very demoralized as they finish the hymn.
text: Mary Patrick is close to tears.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: We sound terrible We need Mary
dialog: Clarence.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: We're losing it.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: I don't understand. Where is she?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must
dialog: proceed without her. Pull yourselves
dialog: together.
text: Clapping his hands briskly, the FLOOR DIRECTOR suddenly
text: steps forward from behind the TV cameras and hustles the
text: choir away from the altar.
speaker_heading: FLOOR DIRECTOR
dialog: Okay, Sisters, we have to move on now.
dialog: That was great, just great. Charlie,
dialog: throw a spot on the pulpit. Let's get a
dialog: balance.
text: Dispirited, the choir leaves the altar and walks toward
text: the back of the church.
dialog: Page 97.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET
text: The motorcycle flies through the streets, breaking every
text: traffic law on the books. Christy's robe flaps behind her
text: in the wind, and she has a wide smile as she rides. As
text: passersby stare at her, she holds out two fingers and
text: blesses them.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL
text: Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral,
text: wringing her hands with worry. Suddenly, her face
text: brightens like the dawn as she sees Christy ride up.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: You're here! Thank goodness!
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL
text: Christy and Mary Robert rush down a side corridor, turn a
text: corner and see two TV Technicians standing near some cables
text: with the letters of the network embroidered on the backs of
text: their jackets. Christy rushes up to them and taps them on
text: the shoulders.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Excuse me -- where's the rehearsal room?
text: The two Technicians turn toward her, and she is horrified
text: to see they are. Joey and Willy. Christy gasps as Willy
text: sticks a gun in her ribs. Joey smiles at her.
speaker_heading: JOEY
text: The rehearsal room is right this way.
text: Joey opens a door that leads to an alley behind the
text: cathedral. Mary Robert looks confused.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Wait, this isn't the way. Who are you?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: They're from my old convent.
text: Christy suddenly lifts her knee into Willy's groin, and he
text: buckles over. She scrambles for the gun, but Joey beats
text: her to it. Christy looks frantically at Mary Robert.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Run! Take off!
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Again?
text: Revived Willy lunges for Mary Robert and grabs her. The
text: two men hustle the two struggling nuns out the door to the
dialog: alley.
dialog: Page 98.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
text: Joey and Willy wrestle the two nuns to the open door of

text: back seat, and Willy climbs in next to them.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Go!
text: Joey starts the car, and it takes off with SQUEALING
text: tires. Willy has his gun pointed at Christy, who sits
text: beside Mary Robert.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: But what do they want? Where are we
dialog: going?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to Joey and Willy)
dialog: She's got nothing to do with this. Let
dialog: her go.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Yeah, right to the cops. No way.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Mary Robert, don't panic. Remember what
dialog: we talked about? Experience?
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (quickly, to Mary
dialog: Robert)
dialog: You can handle this.
text: The car comes to a stop at an intersection. Christy
text: reaches across Mary Robert and opens the car door. She
text: shoves Mary Robert into the street.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Go!

scene_heading: INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL - DAY
text: In the rehearsal room, Mary Robert has just finished
dialog: telling the nuns what happened to Christy.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: You mean -- they kidnapped her?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: She shouldn't have come back. She knew
dialog: she was in danger.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: Were they Catholics?
text: Mother Superior suddenly steps forward.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
text: She isn't a nun. Her real name is
dialog: Christy Van Cartier, and she is a
dialog: professional entertainer. She witnessed
text: a vicious crime, and has been hiding in
dialog: our convent.
text: The nuns all react with shock and emotion.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: An... entertainer?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: She wasn't a nun?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER NUN
dialog: She lied to us?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: But... but... she was such a wonderful
dialog: nun.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Look what she did with the choir. She
dialog: made us sing beautifully.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: That should have tipped us.
dialog: Page 100.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Well, I don't care who she is. We can't
dialog: sing without her!
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: She's our inspiration!
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: She's the act!
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Reverend Mother, I know that you and
dialog: Mary Clarence didn't always agree, but --
dialog: we've got to help her.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: We've got to save her!
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: We can't leave it up to the Feds!
text: The nuns all look to Mother Superior for an answer.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert,
dialog: do you have any idea who those men were?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: She said they were from her old convent.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: But... she was a showgirl. She didn't
dialog: have an old convent.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: She told us about one. The Little
text: Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: All right. It's a beginning. Las
dialog: Vegas, Nevada.
text: All the nuns hurriedly cross themselves.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Mary Lazarus, find the Bishop and tell
dialog: him the situation. Everyone else --
dialog: follow me.
text: Mother Superior leads the way out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: The Driver sits at the wheel of the school bus, reading a

speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Emergency! Open up!
text: The Driver opens the door.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: The San Francisco airport! Immediately!
text: The nuns are all zooming past the Driver, onto the bus.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: (to the Driver)
dialog: Step on it!
text: Mary Lazarus grabs the Driver's sleazy novel, confiscating

text: Eddie's car streaks INTO THE SCENE and parks in front of
dialog: the cathedral.
scene_heading: INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL
text: Eddie rushes into the lobby and sees Bishop O'Hara.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: O'HARA
dialog: There was a kidnapping. We think Las

scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Fifteen hundred for the run to Vegas.
dialog: Rock-bottom.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: But we don't have fifteen hundred!
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: We're nuns!
text: The Manager starts back toward his office.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Can't help you. No exceptions.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Young man!
dialog: Page 102.
text: The voice has a powerful ring of authority to it, and the
text: Manager looks around.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: We are nuns. We pray.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: We pray for good things. Food for the
dialog: hungry.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Peace on Earth.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: However, we can also pray for other
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Measles.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Lawsuits.
speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: Tax audits.
text: There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in

speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Come, Sisters. Let's go to chapel.
dialog: Bring your beads.

speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Wait!
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT SKY - LATER

scene_heading: INT. MOONLIGHT CASINO - NIGHT
text: Packed with gamblers, the room is a flurry of activity.
text: Joey works his way through the crowd, then spots Vince near

speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: We got her.
dialog: Page 103.
text: Vince follows Joey out of the casino with a grim
dialog: expression.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE ROOM
text: Vince and Joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with
text: boxes. Christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room,

text: Christy sits very calmly, despite the anger she is in.
text: She seems distinctly nun-like in her radiant serenity.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (turning on the charm)
dialog: Babe.
text: Christy does not reply.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Babe, what happened here? Look at you.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Good evening, Vincent.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I
dialog: know you. What did you think you were
text: doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out.
dialog: No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I am sorry for all my sins. And yours.
text: Vince, Willy and Joey all look at each other, perplexed.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: She's a nun, Vince.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (kneeling by Christy)
dialog: I love you, Chris. I always will. I
dialog: gave you so much. My time. My
dialog: affection. A big-time career. And how
dialog: do you repay me? What's the thanks I
dialog: get? Where's the loyalty, huh? Where's
dialog: the love?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You will be judged, Vincent. We all
dialog: will.
text: Vince stands; the charm hasn't worked. He's getting
dialog: angry.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: What do you mean -- judged? I don't get
dialog: judged, baby.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Page 104.
speaker_heading: VINCE (CONT'D)
dialog: And who are you to talk? You were
dialog: nothing. You couldn't even sing. I must
dialog: have been out of my mind.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: She's acting weird, Vince. Ever since
dialog: we picked her up.
speaker_heading: JOEY
text: It's spooky. It's like she ain't even
dialog: afraid or nothing.
text: Vince grabs the front of Christy's habit and squeezes it
text: tightly around her throat.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: She's afraid. Come on, tell the boys
dialog: you're afraid.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: I feel sorry for you, Vincent. And I
dialog: forgive you.
text: This really throws Vince, and angers him further. He
text: glares at Christy, and then releases her. He turns to Joey
dialog: and Willy.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Who gives a damn? Waste her.
text: Joey and Willy look a little unsure as Vince storms out of
dialog: the room.
scene_heading: INT. PLANE

scene_heading: INT. BAR AREA

speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: It's done?
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Not... totally.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (disturbed)
dialog: What's the problem?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: She's... she's a nun.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Are you nuts? She's not a nun. It's
dialog: Christy. She's a babe!
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: But, Vince, how do you know she didn't
dialog: like, join up and become a nun when she
dialog: was in that convent?
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: It didn't happen.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: She was real quiet and peaceful all the
text: way back in the car.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: I can't believe this. Okay, I want both
dialog: you guys to go back there, and both of
dialog: you shoot her at the same time.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Right. That way we'd never know which
text: bullet got to her brain and killed her
dialog: first. It could always be the other guy.
text: They all look happy with this solution as Joey and Willy
dialog: leave.
scene_heading: INT. STOREROOM
text: Christy still shows no signs of fear as Joey and Willy
text: take out their guns.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Okay, we got one-two-three, and on three
dialog: we both shoot. Got it?
dialog: Page 106.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Got it.
text: Joey points his gun at Christy's left temple, and Willy
text: points his gun at her right temple.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: One... two...
text: Christy closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Three!
text: Neither man shoots. They look at each other with anger.
text: Christy opens her eyes.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: You didn't shoot!
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Neither did you!
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I figured if you were gonna, then I
dialog: wouldn't have to.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: That's what I figured, too.
scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS HELIPORT
text: The nuns leave the terminal and stand on the sidewalk out
dialog: front.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: But where?
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Look! There she is!
text: Mary Patrick is pointing to a group of billboards that
text: feature huge ads for the local hotels and casinos. The
text: center billboard has a splashy picture of a roulette wheel,
text: the Elvis impersonator, and Christy and the Ronelles. The
text: bottom part of the billboard shows the name of the
dialog: Moonlight Casino and Lounge.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: But how do we get there?
dialog: Page 107.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Stand back.
text: (she strides into the
dialog: road)
dialog: Taxi!
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
text: Once again, Joey and Willy find Vince.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: It didn't work, Vince.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: You were both supposed to put your guns
text: to her head and shoot.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We both missed.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Okay, so the problem is still the nun
dialog: outfit, right?
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: So, take it off.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Strip down a nun? You want us to fry?
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: For like, twelve zillion eternities?
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: I'm telling you, she's not a nun! Get
text: her out of the nun outfit, and put her in
dialog: some clothes.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Maybe pants.
speaker_heading: WILLY
text: A sweater.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: And then we can ice her. No nun, no
dialog: evil eye.
text: Joey and Willy are very confident about this solution.
text: They strut off, pleased with themselves.
dialog: Page 108.
scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: Eddie strides out of the airport; he took a later flight
text: than the nuns. A squad car is waiting; Clarkson beckons
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CLARKSON
dialog: Lieutenant!
text: Eddie jumps in the car. Clarkson turns on the red bubble
text: light and the SIREN, and the car zooms off.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Joey and Willy return to the storage room, looking
text: confident of their mission this time. Christy glances up
text: at them as they enter, and Willy begins to untie her.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: We got it all worked out.
text: He works the ropes free, and Christy rubs her wrists to
dialog: get circulation back again.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Okay, Christy -- strip.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: That... thing. That nun thing. Take it
dialog: off.
text: Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: What's she doing?
speaker_heading: JOEY
text: She's praying.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: And God bless Joey and Willy, who are
text: only trying to do their jobs.
dialog: (faking Latin)
dialog: Pox fibula tibia vobiscum. Et marcus
dialog: domino's pizza. Have mercy. Amen.
text: (she looks up at the
dialog: guys)
dialog: I'm finished now. Help me up.
text: As Joey and Willy bend down to help her up, Christy
text: suddenly grabs their neckties in each hand. With a fierce
text: jerk, she pulls the neckties with all her might, smashing
text: Joey's head against Willy's.
dialog: Page 109.
text: Stunned, Joey and Willy stagger backward, holding their
text: heads. Christy scrambles out the door while the two men
text: groan in pain.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Joey and Willy burst out of the room with guns drawn. At
text: the far end of the corridor, they spot a glimpse of black

speaker_heading: JOEY
text: There she goes! she's taking the stairs
dialog: I
text: They run quickly after her.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY

scene_heading: INT. CASINO
text: A door swings open into the casino, and Christy appears,
text: looking frantic. A MUFFLED SHOT is heard behind her, and
text: she sprints into the casino.
text: Seconds later, Joey and Willy appear.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Find Vince and tell him what happened.
dialog: I'll take this side of the room.
text: Willy hurries away to find Vince, and Joey starts
text: searching the crowd.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MOONLIGHT HOTEL AND CASINO
text: Three cabs ROAR up in front of the building and nuns
text: tumble out.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO ENTRANCE
text: The nuns enter the casino and stop dead in their tracks.
text: Before them is a large room filled with glitter and sin,
text: the SOUND of jackpots and crap tables.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Brace yourselves, Sisters.
text: In unison, the nuns all cross themselves.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
text: Spread out and look for Mary Clarence.
dialog: Try to blend in.
text: The nuns spread to every part of the room, looking for
dialog: Christy.
dialog: Page 110.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
text: A blackjack table; a game is in progress, with several

speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: A Benedictine.
text: The CROUPIER and the players stare at the two nuns.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
text: Christy is making her way past a roulette table.
text: Suddenly, she sees Joey coming toward her, making his way
text: through the crowd. Christy grabs the arm of a SALESMAN
text: playing roulette.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Place your bets.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to the Salesman)
dialog: Red 21.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: You sure? How do you know?
text: Christy looks up to heaven.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: (to the Croupier)
dialog: Red 21.
text: Joey stands at the opposite side of the roulette table,
text: glaring at Christy. The crowd around the table watches
text: Christy for a moment, then they all put their chips down on
dialog: Red 21.
text: Joey starts working his way around the table toward
text: Christy as the Croupier spins the wheel. The ball falls
text: into a slot.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Black 14.
text: Everyone at the table turns toward Christy, outraged. She
text: gives them a reprimanding look.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Did you learn something?
text: Christy suddenly realizes that Joey is almost at her side.
text: She shoves the Salesman against him and runs away.
dialog: Page 111.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
text: We see two long rows of slot machines, with gamblers
dialog: working every machine.
text: Willy appears at one end of the row, scanning the area for
text: Christy. He sees a nun crossing at the far end of the row,
text: and she moves out of sight. Willy heads in that direction.
text: Someone hits a JACKPOT behind him, and he turns toward the
text: sound. As he does. he sees another nun crossing at the
text: opposite end of the row of machines. Willy turns again --
text: now he sees three nuns crossing at the opposite end. He

scene_heading: INT. BLACKJACK AREA
text: As Christy moves past a blackjack game, she suddenly sees
text: Vince moving toward her. Turning quickly, she moves away
text: from Vince, but suddenly sees Joey coming toward her from
text: the opposite direction. Trapped for a moment, she has
text: panic in her eyes. Suddenly she is flanked by Mother
dialog: Superior and Mary Patrick.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Saving you. Move!
text: The nuns surround Christy and head through the crowd in a
text: cluster. Joey and Vince pursue them from different
text: directions. Just before they catch them, Mother Superior
text: barks an order.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Break!
text: The nuns split up, each taking a different direction.
text: Vince and Joey look bewildered.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Get her!
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Which one!
dialog: Page 112.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: The nun!
text: Vince, Joey and Willy each pick a nun and follow her.
text: Vince catches up to a nun, whom we only see from the rear.
text: He grabs her shoulder.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Babe.
text: The nun spins around; it is Mother Superior.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Sweetheart.
text: Vince releases her and frantically searches the crowd
dialog: again.
text: Joey catches up with his nun, only to find it is Mary

dialog: for the moment.
scene_heading: INT. SLOT MACHINE AREA
text: We FIND Eddie scanning the floor and seeing nuns spread

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Move in. Seal off the exits, but don't
dialog: come inside till I tell you.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
text: Vince, Joey and Willy run into each other in the center of
dialog: the casino.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: There's nuns everywhere! Hundreds of
dialog: 'em!
text: All the nuns suddenly come together, and see that the

text: Christy in the center of the group.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: There she is!
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Which one?
text: Christy sees Vince pointing at her.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Quick, there's another way out of here.
dialog: Follow me.
dialog: Page 113.
text: Christy runs toward a set of glass doors set off to one
text: side. The other nuns follow her.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: She's heading for the lounge! Go!
text: Vince, Joey and Willy head for the lounge.
text: Across the room, Eddie sees Christy and the cluster of
text: nuns head through the glass doors. He barks into his
text: walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Move in -- now!
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE
text: The lounge is deserted between shows, and all the lights

speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I can't see anything in here!
speaker_heading: VINCE
text: Willy -- hit the lights.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Find 'em!
text: Willy moves off to find the light switch. There is a
text: flash of black and white fabric behind some chairs.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: There!
text: Before he can shoot, there is another
text: flash of fabric on the opposite side of
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (aiming)
dialog: No -- there!
text: And a third flash of fabric near the stage.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Over there!
text: Willy has found the lights, and the lounge is suddenly
text: brightly lit. The mobsters blink for a moment, then find
text: all the nuns bunched together in a corner, trying to find
text: an exit.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Freeze! Everybody!
dialog: Page 114.
text: The nuns turn and face the mobsters, shielding Christy.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Joey?
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Where is she?
text: Christy steps forward, to the front of the stage.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Right here. Let the others go -- they
dialog: have nothing to do with this.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Joey -- do it.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: But, boss -- she's still, you know, a
dialog: nun.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: She's a broad! Got it! Just some
dialog: broad!
text: Mother Superior steps forward.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: (with authority)
dialog: I guarantee you, she is no broad. She
dialog: is Sister Mary Clarence, of St.
text: Katherine's Convent. She is a model of
dialog: generosity, virtue and love. You have my
dialog: word, gentlemen. She is a nun.
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Hear that? Now aren't you glad we
dialog: didn't shoot her?
text: Vince has had enough. Facing Christy, he raises the gun
text: and points it right between Christy's eyes, only inches
text: away. The nuns all recoil with horror.
text: BLAM! The gun goes off, but Christy isn't hit. She
text: blinks her eyes open, shocked to be alive. Instead, it's
text: Vince who falls, crumpling to the floor, and clutching his
dialog: shoulder.
text: Across the room, Eddie holds a smoking police revolver.
text: The nuns all swarm around Christy joyously.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Christy.

speaker_heading: MARY LAZARUS
dialog: (also smiling)
dialog: Van Cartier.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You know? About me? About everything?
text: Christy breaks away from the jubilant nuns. She faces
dialog: Mother Superior.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You saved my life.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: I'm a Christian.
text: Police pour into the room and gather up Joey, Willy and
text: Vince. Eddie walks over to Christy and Mother Superior.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Don't you have a concert to go to?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: That depends. Sisters, you don't know
dialog: this, but Reverend Mother's been making
text: all sorts of noises about resigning.
dialog: That's bad news. I don't know if we
dialog: could sing, if we thought that was true.
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: Not a note.
speaker_heading: MARY PATRICK
dialog: Impossible.
text: Mary Lazarus coughs, and points to her throat, as if she
text: has laryngitis. All the other nuns imitate her.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (to Mother Superior)
dialog: Then I guess you're stuck. Life
dialog: sentence. No parole.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Very well.
dialog: (she turns to Eddie)
dialog: I hold you responsible for all of this,
dialog: For introducing a lounge act into my
dialog: convent. For utterly disrupting our way
dialog: of life. And for placing all of us in
dialog: mortal danger.
dialog: (sincerely, with a
dialog: smile)
dialog: Thank-you.
dialog: Page 116.
text: ANGLE on Christy, watching this. She grins.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch.
dialog: Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So
dialog: you think, after all this, maybe I really
dialog: am a nun?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I don't know. There's only one way to
dialog: be absolutely sure.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Yeah, like what?
text: Eddie takes Christy in his arms, and they begin a kiss.
text: As they do so, Vince struggles toward Christy, as two cops
text: hold him back. He is furious.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: I was good to you! You re nothing but
dialog: no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit
dialog: Tramp!
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (staring at Vince,
dialog: seeing him for the scum
dialog: that he is)
dialog: That used to be true, Vince. I was with
dialog: you. But something happened. And I'm
dialog: different now. Real--different. I've
dialog: had, well, you might call it -- a
dialog: religious experience. And I've got just
dialog: two words for you. And those two words
dialog: are...
speaker_heading: MARY ROBERT
dialog: (afraid Christy will
dialog: curse)
dialog: Mary Clarence!
