speaker_heading: GRETCHEN
dialog: Regarding what exactly?
speaker_heading: CLOUDIO

speaker_heading: DAMRISH
dialog: The early stuff was great. Then it

speaker_heading: RHODORA
dialog: You are informed. It was Polly and me
dialog: writing the songs so it lost something
dialog: when she went her own way.
speaker_heading: DAMRISH
dialog: Why'd you split up?
speaker_heading: RHODORA
dialog: Who remembers through all the booze and
dialog: the pills? The point is I’ve gone from
dialog: anarchist to purveyor of good taste, so I
