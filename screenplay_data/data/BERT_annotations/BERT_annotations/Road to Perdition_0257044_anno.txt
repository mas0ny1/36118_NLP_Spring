dialog: There are many stories about Michael

scene_heading: INT. DRUG STORE - DAY
text: Michael parks his bike. Enters. He drops his NEWSPAPER BAG

text: Now we see his FACE for the first time. Innocent.
dialog: Inquisitive.
text: Michael pays for the papers he’s sold. As for the owner

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING (LATER)
text: Michael and Peter are doing their HOMEWORK at the table.
text: Annie is cooking. Michael looks down to his work: Math. A
text: BLANK page. He glances at Peter who writes fluently in his
text: school book. Annie senses her eldest son struggling with his
text: homework. It’s not an unusual occurrence. She moves over to
text: him, bends down, whispering in his ear conspiratorially:
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I‘1l help you with it later....
text: Michael smiles. She kisses his cheek.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)

text: We don’t see his face.
text: ON MICHAEL: watching in silence, cautious yet fascinated by
dialog: the mysteries of a father’s ritual:
text: CLOSE: Sullivan removes his tie and gracefully lays it on the
text: bed... Next to it, he lays some keys and rosary beads... He
text: removes a holstered Colt 45 and places it next to them.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

scene_heading: EXT. ROONEY’S ESTATE - DAY
text: The CAR pulls into the circular drive of a sprawling

text: clothes, head into the MANSION.
scene_heading: INT. ROONEY’S MANSION - HALL - DAY
text: Sullivan opens the door, letting them into a dark, lavish
text: hall. MOURNERS, laughing and chattering. Old women, working

text: interior. Sullivan removes his hat and steers his family
text: through the throng into -
scene_heading: INT. ROONEY’S MANSION - ANTE ROOM - DAY
text: A quiet room.
text: Annie, Sullivan and the boys enter. Sullivan and Michael head
dialog: O.S. to the coffin to pray their respects...

text: COFFIN rests on a bed of ICE. Buckets catch the drips.
text: Sullivan notices Michael’s curiosity.
speaker_heading: SULLIVAN
dialog: Ice helps preserve the body.
text: Sullivan and Michael kneel and pray. After a few seconds
text: Michael peeks over the edge at the DEAD MAN; the skin, waxy
text: and pale. Pennies on his eyes. Fascinating. Michael
text: glances at Sullivan. His eyes are closed in prayer.
text: Sullivan makes the sign of the cross. Michael follows his
dialog: lead.
text: Sullivan rises, with Michael and turns to find ROONEY leaning
text: against the door, smiling. He is a man of 70’s, handome.
speaker_heading: ROONEY
dialog: Who’s got a hug for a lonely old man?
text: Michael and Peter rush to him, delighted. He scoops them up
dialog: in turn.
speaker_heading: ROONEY (CONT'D)

dialog: too scared.
speaker_heading: CONNOR (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

text: He unfolds his written speech, decides against it.
speaker_heading: ROONEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I had this speech prepared, but it
dialog: would be dishonest of me to say that I

dialog: it hurts us all.
dialog: (murmurs of approval)
dialog: I’1l1 tell you what I do remember
dialog: though. And Finn will remember this
dialog: too. And that’s... Danny on the high
dialog: school football team. A championship

dialog: (laughter)
dialog: Mistakes. You know, we all make’em

dialog: Words, I'll wager, that have a little
dialog: more poetry than mine.
text: Applause. McGOVERN takes the stage, Rooney hugs him.
speaker_heading: MCGOVERN
dialog: Thank you, John. My brother Danny
dialog: wasn’t wise, nor was he gentle. And
text: with a skinfull of liquor in him... he
dialog: was a pain in the ass.
text: Gentle laughter from the crowd.
speaker_heading: MCGOVERN (CONT’D)
dialog: Bute he was loyal. And brave. And he

speaker_heading: SULLIVAN
dialog: Sure, Finn, sure. You’1ll take care of

scene_heading: INT. ROONEY’S MANSION - GRAND PARLOR - NIGHT
text: It is later. The musicians are playing a REEL.
text: The majority of the crowd are drunk and dancing.
text: Amongst the crowd, we see the following:
text: A YOUNG GIRL invites MICHAEL to dance. He stands up, but
text: shakes his head, declining.
text: ROONEY , shuffling charmingly across the room in time to the
text: music. A glass of whisky in each hand.
text: ANNIE is dancing with SEAN, (one of Rooney’s men). She whirls
text: around, hair flying. SULLIVAN sits to the side, watching
dialog: her.
text: Connor is dancing with a young girl. He is very good -
text: slick, smooth. On-lookers cheer him on.
text: The music finishes. Connor ends with a deftly executed dip.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Rooney sits at the piano, playing. The room slowly goes

text: Sullivan joins him on the piano stool. Begins to play along

text: flow. A memory of childhood.
text: CLOSE: Connor watches his father and Sullivan through the
text: crowd. He is smiling, though his eyes aren’t.
text: CLOSE: Annie smiles slightly.
text: CLOSE: Rooney and Sullivan’s hands move in concert, two hard
