scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER/EXT. LARGE CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT 1
text: Through the window of a Land Rover, we see a construction
text: site working at full capacity. Huge arc lights and
text: floodlights illuminate the scene and men are hard at work.
text: A group of men are in discussion in a pool of light. There
text: is a conversation, then one of the men breaks off and takes a
text: call on his cellphone. He is distant, not even the focal
text: point of the shot. He puts his finger in his ear to hear the
text: call more clearly. He is too far away for us to see his
text: reactions or expression but, when he cuts the call, he walks
text: directly toward the car and the other men turn to watch him
dialog: go.
text: As he gets closer we see he wears a tie and heavy boots and a
text: heavy coat. He wears a hard hat. He finds a key fob and
text: hits it. The lights inside the car glow in response.
text: The man gets into the driver’s seat. He is in his thirties,
text: a face made of stone and unused to expressions of emotion.
text: This is IVAN LOCKE.
text: He sits in the driver’s seat for a few moments. He takes a
dialog: breath and we might guess (or we might not) that he has just
dialog: had some important news. Is he scared, angry?
text: He takes out his cellphone and looks, deciding whether or not
text: to make a call. He checks his watch. He decides there isn’t
text: time for the call. He puts the phone away quickly and fires
text: the engine.
text: He shifts gear and reverses. We stay with him and will stay
text: with him intensely for the rest of the story.
text: The car bumps over rough ground as Ivan heads for the big
text: secure gates that open out onto the street. The construction
text: site is massive and it takes a while to reach the edge of it.
text: Trucks rumble and generators roar. This is Ivan’s world.
text: The gates are opened by a guy in a high viz jacket. Ivan
text: reaches the kerb of the road and indicates right as a reflex.
text: But he doesn’t pull away.
dialog: He realizes that this time he must choose which way he will
dialog: go. He has a decision to make but he is a man who makes a
text: hundred hard decisions a day. Even so, he takes time.
text: A massive truck pulls up inches behind him and its headlights
text: fill Ivan’s car. Ivan continues to make his decision as his
text: indicator ticks away the seconds.
text: The truck hoots its baleful horn, the voice of fate.
text: Ivan hits the indicator to indicate left instead of right.
text: He turns left and joins light evening traffic.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 3.
scene_heading: EXT. SITE THROUGH CCTV CAMERA 2
text: We see Ivan pulling out of the site through the lens of a
dialog: CCTV camera...
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER/EXT. CITY STREETS 3
text: Ivan will now drive through city streets toward the M6
text: motorway, a couple of miles away. We will not blink as we
text: study him as he drives...
text: Ivan is now confronting the crisis in his head. On the site
text: he was in a familiar place but now he is on a journey and
dialog: must necessarily begin to consider the destination and the
text: place he is leaving.
text: His first decision is to make a phone call on his hands free
dialog: car phone. This is an important component of the story so we
dialog: should take some time establishing the mechanism. He has a
dialog: long list of speed dial numbers, identified by names or
dialog: locations.
text: He speed dials a number labelled ‘Bastard’...
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Hello, can I speak to Gareth?
text: We hear a woman’s voice from the hands-free phone. Many
text: voices will come into the car during this story. The first
text: is a woman in her forties (GARETH’S WIFE)...
speaker_heading: GARETH’S WIFE (OOV)
dialog: He’s not back yet. Can I ask who’s
dialog: calling?
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Ivan Locke.
speaker_heading: GARETH’S WIFE (OOV)
dialog: Can I say what it’s regarding?
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Concrete.
text: Ivan takes a moment and decides an explanation would be
dialog: pointless...
speaker_heading: IVAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you tell him it’s urgent and
dialog: tell him to call me back.
speaker_heading: GARETH’S WIFE (OOV)
dialog: Does he have your number?
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 4.
text: We hear children in the background and a TV. Ivan reacts to
dialog: the family sounds because the world of children and family is
text: about to explode and he will be cut adrift from it forever.
speaker_heading: GARETH’S WIFE (OOV)
dialog: What was your name again?
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Ivan Locke.
speaker_heading: GARETH’S WIFE (OOV)
dialog: Something about concrete.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GARETH’S WIFE (OOV)
dialog: Will he know what?
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: No. Something has come up. I need
dialog: to tell people...
text: Ivan almost chokes on some unexpected emotion. It is a shock
text: to us and to him, like undigested food hitting his gullet...
speaker_heading: IVAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s urgent.
text: A dog barks.
speaker_heading: GARETH’S WIFE (OOV)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I said it’s very urgent. Thanks.
text: He cuts the call and drives. The emotion that just struck
dialog: him was a bad development so early. He has a lot to do in
dialog: the next hour and a half and he must hold this together at
text: all costs. He drives for a while to calm himself. Then,
text: when he is sure he is ready, he makes another call...
text: We hear a mobile phone answer message. The voice is BETHAN,
dialog: early thirties...
speaker_heading: BETHAN’S ANSWER MESSAGE (OOV)
dialog: Hi, this is Bethan. I can’t get to
dialog: the phone right now, please leave a
dialog: message.
text: Ivan misses the cue of the beep by a second because he’s
dialog: getting his voice straight. Finally...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: It’s Ivan. I got your messages.
dialog: I’m on my way and I’‘1l get there.
dialog: I’m in the car now.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 5
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’ll be about an hour and a half
dialog: unless there’s traffic.
text: He takes a moment...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: It’ll be ok. If the nurses or
dialog: anybody wants to talk to me I’m
dialog: only on this number. Or if the
dialog: doctors or anybody. It’1ll be ok.
dialog: I‘ll get there. The traffic should
dialog: be ok.
text: He cuts the call. He drives and twenty seconds later his
text: phone rings...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Ivan Locke.
text: We hear a soft Southern Irish accent...
text: A pause.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I just got your message. It’s a
dialog: joke, is it?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I know it’s a shock but it will be
dialog: ok?
speaker_heading: DONAL (INCREDULOUS) (OOV)
dialog: Ok?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I will go through everything with
dialog: you and it’1ll be ok.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: You know where I am? I’m ata
dialog: service station. I’m turning the
dialog: fucking van round. I put the other
dialog: lads out on the hard shoulder. I
dialog: was halfway home.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: What the fuck happened?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: It's a family thing.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Is someone...
text: He pauses.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 6.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it a bereavement?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I don’t have a choice...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Is it one of the kids?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Donal, I need you to just fix this
dialog: up and be alright...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: And solid. Which you are. Which
dialog: you are. Just from when the sun
dialog: comes up tomorrow morning until
dialog: when it’s all been pumped. I need
dialog: you to hold it together. You won’t
dialog: be alone. I can be on the phone.
dialog: I‘1l talk to you every five minutes
dialog: until the pump is finished...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: On the fucking phone?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: On the phone.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Have you gone mad?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: DONAL (RUNNING ON) (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, at 5.45am tomorrow morning we
dialog: have three hundred and fifty metric
dialog: tons of wet concrete being
dialog: delivered to our site. We have two
dialog: hundred trucks from all over the
dialog: fucking country descending on us...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CORRECTING)
dialog: Three hundred and fifty five metric
dialog: tons, two hundred and eighteen
dialog: trucks.
text: A disbelieving pause.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: It's a joke. Is it?
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 7
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I have no choice.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Is it a bereavement?
text: Ivan never lies. Silence. A long pause.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Ivan, what the fuck has happened?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I need you to just do this.
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, I hate myself even hearing
dialog: myself even saying this, but if
dialog: someone’s died like your mother or
dialog: someone, could you not go wherever
dialog: you have to go after twelve
dialog: tomorrow when the concrete is
dialog: pumped?
dialog: Ivan drives...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what I’m saying. Whoever
dialog: is dead is not...you know...they
dialog: won't be any different between now
dialog: and midday. Dead people stay the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: No one is dead. Donal, I need you
dialog: to do this, ok? I need you to be
dialog: there with enough stuff and the
text: right heads when the sun comes up.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Holy fucking Mary. I’m a fucking
dialog: concrete farmer. Did you ever see
dialog: me read anything written down on
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: You’re ok. You know how to run a
dialog: pump, you know how to run trucks
dialog: back-to-back and turn trucks back,
dialog: you know how to test for slumps.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I’ve never even shovelled on a pump
dialog: this big...
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 8
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: It’s the same but more of it. You
dialog: just do the same but for longer.
dialog: Check it, slump it, send it back if
dialog: it’s piss and pump it if its right.
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: What did Gareth say?
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: I haven’t spoken to him yet.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: He’1ll fucking...
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: I know...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: He’ll go fucking sideways and
dialog: around the houses like his arse is
text: on fire.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, it’1ll be the sack.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Jesus, you’re the best foreman I
dialog: ever fucking worked with and the
dialog: best site manager. What the hell
dialog: is it that’1ll make you risk the
dialog: sack?
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: I need you to do this for me Donal.
dialog: Start rounding up some cowboys then
dialog: call me back. I'’11 be on the road.
dialog: He cuts the call. Ivan is a strong practical man and he is
dialog: facing a crisis which is unfamiliar, but some things he can
dialog: keep control of. Men like Donal he can handle. He drives
text: some more but ten seconds later the phone rings...
speaker_heading: IVAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ivan Locke.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Ivan?
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 9
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Where are you?
text: When Bethan speaks she sounds scared to death and in pain.
text: She’s mid-forties, middle class...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: I just got admitted. I’m in the
dialog: labor ward. It’s called Bailey
dialog: ward.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Did they say how long?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: I'm five centimetres.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Dilated.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I know but what does that mean?
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: They just left me. I’m on my own.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Is there a bell?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I don’t know, a buzzer or something
dialog: to get a nurse.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: They just put their head round.
dialog: They said it could be hours.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Are you ok?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: I need the lavatory...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Tell them. Tell them.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: There’s no one here.
text: He stops.
text: A pause.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 10.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Is there a bell?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: They don’t have bells. What do you
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: When they put their head round the
dialog: door, tell them you need the
dialog: lavatory.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
text: It’s like a pain I’ve never had.
dialog: Right inside all the way up to my
text: chest.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Have you talked to anyone about
dialog: pain?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Stopping the pain. Have you
dialog: decided.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: They said ‘let’s see’.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Just have whatever there is.
dialog: Seriously.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I don’t know. For the pain.
dialog: Because fuck...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: You were there when your wife gave
dialog: birth.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Don’t think about that, get them to
dialog: give you everything. If they ask,
dialog: just say I want everything.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: What did she have?
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 11.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Your precious wife.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I can’t remember. The thing they
dialog: put in your spine.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Were you there?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: And you'll be here...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Because I’m really in pain...
text: She begins to cry. Ivan drives on through the night.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: The traffic’s ok. Just tell them to
dialog: give you everything for the pain.
dialog: I‘ll be there in an hour and a
dialog: half. If anything happens, just
dialog: shout as loud as you can.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
text: It’s cold and all the windows are
text: open.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Tell them to close the windows.
dialog: The traffic’s ok. Go to the
dialog: lavatory. I'll be there.
text: She begins to sob and we hear a whimper of pain.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (SOFTLY TO HIMSELF)
dialog: (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck.
text: A pause.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 12.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Have you even told your wife that
dialog: someone is having your baby?
dialog: He drives....
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I’m about to do that. I have a list
dialog: of things I have to do tonight
dialog: while I’m driving.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: So I’m on a list.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Yes. Tonight, yes.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Do you love me?
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: That’s a question you’re asking
dialog: probably because of the pain or
dialog: something. How could I love you?
text: The call is cut. Ivan drives on. He speaks softly to
text: himself as he glances in the rear view mirror and sees his
dialog: own eyes...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: So. Hell.
text: He must concentrate on the road. He flicks through his speed
text: dial numbers and finds ‘HOME’. He is about to call but the
text: phone rings....
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Ivan Locke.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: It’s Gareth. I spoke to Donal.
dialog: This had better be more than good.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Hello Gareth...
speaker_heading: GARETH (INTERRUPTING, FURIOUS) (OOV)
dialog: Speak to me only about the morning.
text: It is apparent Gareth has already heard the news but Ivan
text: confirms.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 13.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I won’t be on site for the pump
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: GARETH (TO HIMSELF) (OOV)
dialog: This is not happening.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: The truth is tonight I’m going to
dialog: become a father.
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: She’s in London. I have to be
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Ok, ok, ok, let me read you
dialog: something. Ivan. Are you
dialog: listening? Yeah? Good. It’s from
dialog: Mr Dean in Chicago. ‘Good luck
dialog: tomorrow with the pour. We have
dialog: just had it confirmed by CGO that
dialog: this will be the biggest single
dialog: concrete pour ever made in Europe
dialog: outside of nuclear/military
dialog: projects. I know the day is in the
dialog: safest of hands. Best wishes,
dialog: Mitchell.’ That’s Mitchell Dean
dialog: himself. The President of the whole
dialog: fucking company. Did you hear that
dialog: Ivan? From Chicago. USA.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: You’1l have to speak up.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Yes, I heard.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: And you're the man in charge of the
dialog: entire operation but, with ten
dialog: hours to go, you've decided you
dialog: won't be there.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Donal will handle it. He is a good
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: GARETH (EXPLODING) (OOV)
dialog: Don’t you fucking dare say that to
dialog: me.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 14.
speaker_heading: GARETH (EXPLODING) (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t fucking dare to give
dialog: qualitative appraisals of my staff
dialog: and say ‘good man’ like it’s going
dialog: off to buy a fucking ice cream.
text: Ivan drives.
text: A pause...
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: This is fucking concrete. Like
dialog: shit. Like piss when it comes, you
dialog: pump it.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Like babies.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: It's a joke to you.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: No. Right now nothing is a joke
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: So it’s not your wife giving birth?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: No it’s someone else.
speaker_heading: GARETH (INCREDULOUS) (OOV)
dialog: Jesus. Ivan? You are the last
dialog: person on earth...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes. I am the last person on
dialog: earth. But it happened.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: And this woman can’t give birth on
dialog: her own?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I've made a decision. There is
dialog: nobody else who could be with her.
dialog: She has no friends in London and is
dialog: a quite fragile person.
speaker_heading: GARETH (SNARLING) (OOV)
dialog: Fragile?
dialog: Ivan drives...
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re going to abandon the biggest
dialog: fucking concrete pour in Europe to
dialog: hold someone’s fucking hand because
dialog: she’s fragile.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 15.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: And because the baby was caused by
dialog: me. That is the decision I have
dialog: made. I have not behaved in the
dialog: right way with this woman. At all.
dialog: I have behaved in a way that isn’t
dialog: like me. But now I am going to do
dialog: the right thing.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: And Chicago can go to fucking hell.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: It is the decision I have made.
dialog: I’m not going to turn back.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. You know how
dialog: many million pounds are riding on
dialog: tomorrow?...
dialog: Ivan drives...
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: If any one of those pumps fucks up
dialog: we are facing ten million pounds
dialog: worth of losses in fifteen minutes.
dialog: So we get that every fifteen
dialog: minutes for the whole morning, a
dialog: total shut down, hundred million
dialog: dollars. Pumping the hard stuff
dialog: into soft ground and watching it
dialog: set so we have to pay another
dialog: fucking gang of fucking Hungarian
dialog: monkeys to dig it out again.
dialog: Secondary cost, outside insurance,
dialog: another five million.
text: Ivan drives.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you still there?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes. I have no explanation apart
dialog: from the one I have given. I must
dialog: do the right thing by this woman.
text: A pause. Gareth is about to speak...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: But, Gareth, I have made a pledge
dialog: to myself that I will not allow the
dialog: pour to fuck up.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: This is a joke. Are you wearing a
dialog: fucking red nose?
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 16.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a fucking joke. I’m going
dialog: to call Chicago. If it weren’t for
dialog: the fact that you’ve been so solid
dialog: for us for so many years I would
dialog: fire you down the phone.
dialog: Ivan drives...
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: But I will speak to Chicago first.
dialog: Silence...
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Ivan? Have you lost your fucking
dialog: mind?
text: Ivan checks his rear view mirror.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I made my decision.
text: The call is cut. Ivan drives on as he considers the
dialog: question. Has he lost his mind?
text: We come close to his face as he considers his situation.
text: Then he glances in the rear view mirror. We sense that
text: something in the mirror bothers him, an irritant he tries to
text: ignore but finally can’t.
text: He snaps into the rear view mirror...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: What the fuck are you looking at?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: You’re watching this aren’t you.
dialog: Laughing at my predicament? A
dialog: familiar predicament to a man like
dialog: you, right dad?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: You think ‘there he is, look. Like
dialog: father like son. The man I made’.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: What is it they say? The apple
text: doesn’t fall far from the tree.
dialog: Well that’s where you’re wrong.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 16A.
text: He studies the road, the lights flashing across his face...
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 17.
text: Ivan erupts slowly...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: You listen to me you fucking piece
dialog: of worthless shit. I want you to
dialog: watch...
text: A pause. His face harder and harder...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: In fact I’d like to take a fucking
dialog: shovel and dig you up out of the
dialog: fucking ground and make you watch
dialog: me tonight.
text: He stares into the mirror.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I'd pull open your eyes and kick
dialog: the mud and worms and shit out your
dialog: ears. Just for the duration of this
dialog: fucking journey. Because it’s me
dialog: driving not you.
text: He drives on but his face fixes with determination....
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: And unlike you I‘’1ll go to the place
dialog: where I should be and I’11 be there
dialog: to take care of my fuck up. I’11
dialog: take what’s due to me.
text: He glares into the rear view mirror...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: So you laugh or do what the fuck

dialog: I’ll fix this.
text: Pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I’ll fix it.
text: His phone rings. He glances at the ghost of his father with
dialog: venom.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Yes Donal.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Ok, I’m driving back so I’1l be
dialog: quick. I called Ryan and stole a
dialog: half dozen Poles and some
dialog: Hungarians from Patrick.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 17A.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: I got breakfast tickets for the
dialog: concrete farmers and the shutter
dialog: boys are done bar the fucking about
dialog: with clips. I asked Albanian Alby
dialog: to test the pumps on the Argylle
dialog: side and he said they’re pissing it
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Ok, ok stop. When you get back on
dialog: site you check every pump yourself,
dialog: individually and with your own hand
dialog: on the turner. You don’t ask
dialog: anybody else to check and sign off.
dialog: You go around the whole site and
dialog: you check each one yourself. And
dialog: don’t trust Alby after five because
dialog: he drinks. Now. Talk to me about
dialog: the mix.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Did we say C6?
text: Ivan reacts...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Don’t say that like it’s a
dialog: question.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 18.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Sometimes when I say things it
dialog: sounds like a question when it
dialog: isn’t.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: All the mixes for this pump will be
dialog: C6. Why do you even ask? It’s
text: written on the whiteboard in
dialog: fucking giant letters. I put ‘C6’
dialog: all over the cabin in big red
dialog: letters. Slump of one inch, Cé.
dialog: Don’t ask me questions like that...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: It wasn’t a question. I know you
dialog: don’t like questions.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: What time are you unlocking?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I’m going to sleep here tonight.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Good. Except, don’t sleep. Check
dialog: everything. You’ve got the client
text: sign-off.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Yeah. And the client sign-off on
text: the gates.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
text: That’s what I mean. The gate sign
text: off. Donal, the construction sign
dialog: off should already be filed.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Yeah. It’s ok. That’s what I
dialog: meant.
text: Ivan reacts....
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Ok, you have the phone numbers of
dialog: the plants. Call them now Donal.
dialog: Call every one of the bastards and
dialog: get them to repeat the order. C6 on
dialog: the nose or we send the trucks
dialog: back. Seriously. Those bastards
dialog: will fuck you up with water in the
dialog: gulleys if it rains tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: It won’t rain. It’s going to be
dialog: dry.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 19.
text: A pause. Donal chuckles...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a direct line to God, up in
dialog: heaven, you know?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (OVER HIM)
dialog: You don’t trust God when it comes
dialog: to concrete. Call the plants,
dialog: Donal. Every one of them and get
dialog: them to fax the order back so you
dialog: can check it.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I will. Did you speak to Gareth
dialog: yet?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes. He’s calling Chicago. I’m
dialog: guessing Chicago is going to fire
dialog: me and he’1l put some fucking kid
dialog: on it. So don’t take his calls.
dialog: Don’t listen to anybody else.
dialog: Until the morning this is me and
dialog: you, ok?
text: Ivan cuts the call. He drives. He stares into the rear view.
dialog: (From now, his looks into the rear view are looks into the
text: past, looks at his father, proving he is going to do the
dialog: right thing.)
text: After forty seconds he again brings up his speed dial
text: numbers. He shuffles through to the word ‘HOME’. He steels
text: himself. He hits the button and the phone begins to ring.
text: At this moment, his car joins the motorway...
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY 4
text: From a high gantry we see Ivan’s car joining the stream of
text: other cars heading South. He is just a man in a bubble of
dialog: light, no different to all the other drivers on their own
dialog: journeys....
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER 5
text: Ivan hears the call being taken. It is a boy, fourteen years
dialog: old (EDDIE)
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: Hello.
dialog: This was the last thing Ivan wanted, to hear his son’s voice.
text: He takes a second...
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 20.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Eddie, it’s your dad. Is your
dialog: mother there?
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: She’s not back from the shops
dialog: yet...
text: A pause...
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: She’s getting your beer for the
dialog: match...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I won’t be back for that.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Something came up.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I can’t get out of it...
speaker_heading: EDDIE (NOT REGISTERING) (OOV)
dialog: I’m wearing the shirt. Mum’s
dialog: getting sausages and guess what?
text: She’s wearing the shirt as well.
dialog: It’s so embarrassing. What did you
dialog: say about coming back?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I won’t be back for the match.
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I‘1l listen on the radio.
text: A disbelieving silence...
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: What do you mean? It’s rubbish on
dialog: the radio. You said you'd be back.
dialog: She’s doing sausages.
text: Ivan almost chokes on emotion but holds it together.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Is your brother there?
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: Yeah. You want a word?
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 21.
text: Ivan decides he can’t face it.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: No. Just tell your mother to call
dialog: me when she gets back.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: It’s ok. Get her to call me.
text: He cuts the call. He drives on. The motorway is busy with
text: trucks, lit up in the darkness. He takes a moment then finds
text: Bethan’s name on his speed dial.
dialog: Ivan cuts
dialog: Bethan.
speaker_heading: BETHAN’S ANSWER MESSAGE (OOV)
dialog: Hello, this is Bethan, I’m afraid I
dialog: can’t get to the phone...
text: the call. He drives. Then the phone rings. It is
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Did you call?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Are you ok?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
text: Someone closed the windows.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Did you talk to anyone about pain?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: No. No one’s been in.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: But is everything alright?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: No. It hurts like nothing ever.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I’m on the M6. Hour and a quarter
dialog: if the traffic stays ok. Speak to
dialog: someone about pain.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 22.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Just now I felt like I hate you.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (PRACTICAL)
dialog: We don’t know each other, Bethan.
dialog: That’s the simple truth. This thing
dialog: just happened...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: This ‘thing’...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: ++.SO we can’t love or hate each
dialog: other. This thing happened and
dialog: that’s it. It will go up and down.
dialog: But I’m coming at least.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Do you hate me? For going through
dialog: with it?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I don’t know you so I don’t hate
dialog: you. Do what they tell you to do.
dialog: I have a lot of calls to make. The
dialog: traffic is fine so it’ll be ok.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Please be quick.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes, but there’s a limit.
text: He cuts the call and drives. He suddenly beats the steering
text: wheel with the side of his fist hard, a sudden explosion of
text: fury. Then he gets hold of himself.
text: The phone rings. He sees the number...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Hello Gareth.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Yeah, look. Chicago is having a
dialog: predictable melt down.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: It is. Ok.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: I gave them the whole ten year
dialog: thing. About your ten years
dialog: working for Park without a foot
dialog: wrong...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (UNDER HIM)
dialog: Nine years....
text: A pause.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 23.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: ...-The whole thing. He said he
dialog: goes on emotion. He said the stuff
dialog: about the biggest pour in Europe...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Outside nuclear and military...
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Well, I tell you what, you’re fired
dialog: is what it is. They said they had
dialog: no choice. I said about the ten
dialog: years. But they said they had no
dialog: choice.
text: Ivan drives on.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: So. Ok.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: I never do this on the phone.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: It’s ok. I will still make sure
dialog: the pour is alright.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, this isn’t a matter for
dialog: negotiation. They’ve decided.
dialog: You're fired completely as of right
dialog: this second.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I know, and I don’t blame them.
dialog: But I’m not trying to keep my job.
dialog: I just want the pour to go ok
dialog: tomorrow...
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Ivan...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Listen to me. I want the pour to
dialog: go ok not because of the money...
text: He takes a moment...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I want it to go right for myself
dialog: and for the building. And for the
dialog: concrete. I won’t let it be pumped
dialog: into the wrong place. Tonight and
dialog: tomorrow I will stay on this and
dialog: stay on this and make sure the
dialog: concrete gets poured right.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 24.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, look, I told them about the
dialog: ten years...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Fuck ten years. The concrete will
dialog: come and I will take care of it. I
dialog: know I don’t have a job anymore but
dialog: I will do this anyway as a favor to
text: the building and to the concrete.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Ivan you sound...different.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I am the same.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: You should have just said you were
dialog: sick...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I’m not sick. And I will make sure
dialog: the pour is ok.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, I’ve already handed this over
dialog: to another construction director
dialog: and he will pick it up from...
text: Ivan cuts the call. He drives on, speeds up. The phone
text: rings. The word ‘HOME’ appears. It’s his wife KATRINA.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY 6
text: From surveillance cameras we see Ivan’s car driving in the
text: fast lane. We hear his phone ringing and hear him answer...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Hello, love.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (OOV)
dialog: Hello Katrina...
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER 7
text: Ivan stares ahead as he drives fast.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)

dialog: guess what? I’m wearing the shirt.

text: A pause.
text: A pause.
dialog: Silence.
text: A pause.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 25.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Did Eddie not give you the message.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: What message?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I’m not coming home.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you mean? It’s the match.
dialog: I’m wearing the shirt.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Which phone are you on?
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I can hear the TV. Could you take
dialog: this call on the phone upstairs.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Upstairs? Why?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I have something...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I have something to say.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Can’t it wait until you get home?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I won’t be home.
text: We hear the boys and the TV in the background.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: What’s happened?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Will you go to the phone in the
dialog: bedroom?
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 26.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: What’s happened?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Go to the phone in the bedroom and
dialog: I’1l tell you what’s happened.
text: The line crackles and we hear Katrina call out...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Sean, when I shout put the phone
dialog: down.
text: We hear her walk away, hear the sound of the TV, preparations
text: for a big football match. Ivan hears his two sons arguing.
text: Eddie comes to the phone...
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: Dad, are you coming back?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Eddie, I’m talking to your
dialog: mother...
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: He’s not picked any wingers...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Eddie, will you put the phone down
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: I can’t believe the team he’s
dialog: picked, dad.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Please put the phone down.
text: Eddie puts the phone down. A pause...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (SOFTLY) (OOV)
dialog: So what is it?
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Last year. The job in Croydon. I
dialog: was up and down there for three
dialog: months, remember?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I stayed in that guest house. The
dialog: one I said had bad damp.
text: A pause.
text: A pause.
text: A pause.
dialog: Silence...
dialog: Silence.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 27.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: They gave me an assistant. She
dialog: worked with me on the block
dialog: construction.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: ‘she’?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: She was a secretary. Quite old. We
dialog: worked together...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: She is quite old and lives on her
dialog: own. Forty three or something.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Why are you telling me about some
dialog: woman?
text: Ivan glances in the rear view mirror...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: This is the only time I ever did
dialog: this, Katrina. The only time.
dialog: After the block was settled in,
dialog: there were some drinks to
text: celebrate. The block going in is a
dialog: big thing because it is the base of
dialog: the whole building...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: And she came back to the guest
dialog: house. She isn’t what you would
dialog: call an oil painting. But it was
dialog: wet and cold. She talked about
dialog: being lonely and I talked about
dialog: being happy but lonely sometimes
dialog: when I was away. And there was this
dialog: wine. And this was the only time I
dialog: did this in all our fifteen years.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: And now, tonight, she is giving
dialog: birth.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 28.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Tonight she is giving birth. And
dialog: it’s mine.
text: The call is cut. Ivan drives on. We stay with Ivan for a few
text: minutes as he drives. He is not a man accustomed to moments
text: like this and his reaction is just the blue glistening tip of
text: an iceberg. He looks like a man made of ice in the
text: headlights.
text: The phone rings. Ivan forces himself to answer because he
dialog: knows he must.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Donal.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Look, Ivan, this isn’t a question,
dialog: ok?
text: Ivan waits.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: But I just got off the phone with
dialog: the plant in Stafford and they said
dialog: they know it’s a C6 mix, but how
dialog: far toward C5 can it go.
text: Silence. Ivan is expressionless...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: In other words, if one truck has
dialog: some C5, how badly would that be
dialog: taken?
text: Ivan lets the silence express his disbelief...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Ivan, are you still there?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Donal, what does it say on the
dialog: whiteboard?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: It says C6.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: What does it say on every piece of
dialog: paperwork and every sign off sheet?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: It says C6.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: It says C6. And you know why?
text: A pause.
text: A pause...
dialog: Silence.
text: A pause.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 29.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Because, eventually, when my
dialog: building is complete, it will be
dialog: fifty five floors high. It will
dialog: weigh two million two hundred and
dialog: twenty three thousand metric tons.
dialog: My building will alter the water
dialog: table and squeeze granite. Now...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: ...If the concrete at the base of
dialog: my building is not right, if it
text: slips a half inch, cracks appear.
dialog: If cracks appear they will grow and
dialog: grow and the whole thing will
text: collapse.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, look....
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: You make one mistake, Donal. One,
dialog: little fucking mistake, and the
dialog: world comes down around you. So...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Tell Stafford...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Ccé.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: cé6 it is.
text: Ivan cuts the call. We drive with him for one minute as he
text: contemplates his own mistake. He calls up the number of
dialog: ‘Home’ again.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Katrina...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: That didn’t happen. I’m not
dialog: believing it...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Katrina, I want to move to a
dialog: practical next step...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: I’m here in the dark in our bedroom
dialog: and nothing looks the same...
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 30.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I can’t talk very well. I have
dialog: felt scraped out for months. She
dialog: phoned and said she was having a
dialog: baby and keeping it because it was
dialog: her last chance to be happy. And
dialog: then tonight she phoned and said
dialog: the waters broke and it’s two
dialog: months early. I was going to tell
dialog: you before but the waters broke
dialog: early. So I have to do this now in
dialog: the car. Every night I was going to
dialog: tell you...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: I can’t really breath.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Katrina, you know what happened
dialog: with my dad and how the bastard
dialog: wasn’t around for me and didn’t
dialog: even give me a name...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OVER LAPPING) (OOV)
dialog: No. You’re confused. It’s you
dialog: that’s the bastard, it’s the baby
dialog: that’s the bastard. At least get
dialog: the words right..
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Katrina, I will give the baby my
dialog: name and it will see my face and it
dialog: will know and it won't spend it’s
dialog: life thinking and thinking...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: I’ve closed the door and I’m in the
dialog: dark and I’m almost sure this isn’t
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I should have said all this a long
dialog: time ago. I have behaved not like
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: I have to put the phone down again.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Katrina, don’t go.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: I have to throw up again.
text: The call is cut. Ivan drives. He glances in the rear view
text: mirror. He takes a while to decide to speak again to the
text: ghost. When he speaks it is with self doubt, as if he is
dialog: confiding...
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 31.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (TO THE GHOST)
dialog: I could have said nothing. I could
dialog: have said nothing. Or I could have
dialog: lied. I could have run. I was
dialog: offered a thing in Toronto. A two
dialog: year tower.
text: He suddenly remembers who he is speaking to.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Why am I telling you of all fucking
dialog: people. I can see that shit-eating
dialog: grin on your great fat face, wipe
dialog: it off...
text: Ivan stares at the road ahead.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (TO THE GHOST) (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not you. Pop the fucking
dialog: corks. I’m not you. I'll fix
dialog: this.
text: He drives. He gets a call and sees ‘Home’ and answers
dialog: fast...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Kat, listen....
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: Dad, we’re one nil down.
dialog: Ivan must adjust.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Is your mother there?
dialog: We hear him call...
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: Mum!
text: Eddie comes back on the phone.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Stupid penalty. Are you listening
dialog: on the radio?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: No.
text: We hear a muffled voice.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)

speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Eddie?

dialog: A hesitation with a practical outcome...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I am the father.
speaker_heading: SISTER MARGARET (OOV)
dialog: She’s quite distressed and we were
dialog: wondering if someone was going to

speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes, I’m, an hour away I think if

speaker_heading: SISTER MARGARET (OOV)
dialog: There’s a complication.
text: Ivan speaks evenly.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: What is the complication?
speaker_heading: SISTER MARGARET (OOV)
dialog: A complication with the umbilical
dialog: cord. It means there will be a
dialog: procedure and it would help if dad
dialog: was around. You are dad?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes. I’m driving. I’m doing

speaker_heading: SISTER MARGARET (OOV)

dialog: moment. I just wanted to make sure
dialog: someone was coming.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes. I will be there.
speaker_heading: SISTER MARGARET (OOV)
dialog: Good. Use the emergency entrance.
dialog: Ask for Bailey ward.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Bailey. Ok.
speaker_heading: SISTER MARGARET (OOV)
dialog: She’s very emotional.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: She isn’t used to being emotional I
dialog: think. I think she is normally a
dialog: very quiet person.
text: A puzzled pause...
speaker_heading: SISTER MARGARET (OOV)
dialog: You are her partner?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I am the father. I don’t...
text: A pause...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: .-+-I don’t know her too well if you
dialog: want the truth. But I’m coming.
text: A pause. The sister is used to oddness, the strangeness of
dialog: relationships and continues...
speaker_heading: SISTER MARGARET (OOV)
dialog: She’s very afraid.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I understand. I’m driving.
text: The call is cut. Ivan drives on and thirty seconds pass.
text: The rear view is never far from his thoughts. The phone
text: rings and he sees the name and manages to keep his voice
dialog: under control...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Yes Donal.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I checked all twelve pumps and
dialog: they're pissing out.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 34.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Good. You're testing with C6.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Only C6.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: And you called all the plants?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: They gave me dog’s abuse for
dialog: checking.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: They have the trucks lined up and
dialog: the mix is in?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I ticked off each response after
dialog: the fuck you’s and piss offs and it
dialog: came to six and a half thousand
dialog: cubic metres.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: What about retardant?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: They have retardant on site ready
text: to go into the trucks.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Good. Now, do you have a pen?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Pencil.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Get a pen.
text: We almost hear Donal rolling his eyes. A pause. A drawer...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Ok. I have a pen.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
text: In the top right hand drawer above
dialog: the blow heater you’1l find my
dialog: folder. Get it. It’s going to be
dialog: your Bible tonight.
text: We hear movement, drawers opening.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I don’t see any folder.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 35.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes, it’s there, it’s there. It’s
dialog: got everything you’re going to need
dialog: in there. All the numbers, the
dialog: sign offs, the road closures that
dialog: you have to confirm with the
text: police. The drawer above the blow
dialog: heater.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: The blow heater was taken by the
dialog: Hungarians. You'd think they’d be
dialog: used to the cold wouldn’t you.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Donal, you know which drawer I
dialog: mean.
text: We hear movement and checking. Ivan drives...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, I’ve checked every drawer in
dialog: the cabin. No bible.
text: Ivan drives. He thinks. Then he has an awful realization. He
text: opens the glove compartment and sees a file.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Fuck.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Are you ok?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Fuck.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: What?
text: A pause. Ivan has dropped the file on the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I have it here.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: All the things you’re going to need
dialog: and I have it fucking here in my
dialog: car.
text: A long silence.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: You know Ivan in all the ten years
dialog: I’ve worked with you, I’ve never
dialog: known you to fuck up.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 36.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Ok Donal, give me some time to
dialog: think. Stay near to your phone.
text: Ivan cuts the call and drives. He glances at the folder on
text: the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Fuck.
text: The phone rings. We see ‘Home’. Ivan takes the call
dialog: immediately...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you ok?
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Ok?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Kat please, just hear what I want
dialog: to say...
text: She suddenly screams at the top of her voice...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Of all the things in the world, I
dialog: never thought of you doing
dialog: this!!...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Katrina, don’t let the boys hear
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: You fucked some...!!
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Quietly.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: You fucked her. And then me! I
dialog: looked in my diary and checked and
dialog: I remember when you got home from
dialog: Croydon that weekend and you had a
dialog: big stupid grin...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: The block was in. I was happy with
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: And I sit in the dark.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: It was once.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 37.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: And the difference between never
dialog: and once is the whole world. The
dialog: difference between never and once
dialog: is the difference between good and
dialog: bad.
text: 
text: Ivan checks the rear view...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I know that.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: You don’t know anything.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: You had a big grin that night.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: It was the work. The block was
dialog: down...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: So you fucked someone.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I had two bottles of wine. From
dialog: Portugal.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: And she followed you.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: She'd always been on her own. She
dialog: didn’t have anyone. It was an odd
dialog: night. Not really a bad thought in
dialog: anybody's head.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: A big fucking grin!
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: That isn’t it.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Like you’d won something. I
dialog: remember you coming in and putting
dialog: your coat on the stairs. I thought
dialog: you’d won something.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I was trying to be normal. I can’t
dialog: remember. And the block was down.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 38.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: And that stuff about the baby. You
dialog: said she’s having a baby.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: She’s having the baby tonight.
dialog: Horrible laughter...
text: She sobs.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Forget that. You’re a clown.
dialog: Forget that. You're a stupid clown.
dialog: You think it’s yours? Why would it
dialog: be yours if she fucks everybody...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: She doesn’t...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: If she fucks you, she fucks
dialog: everybody.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: She isn’t like that. She had given
dialog: up on having anything.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: I can’t believe it’s me and you and
dialog: we're talking about somebody else.
text: Like someone broke into the house.
text: A long silence. Finally...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (SOFTLY)
dialog: I want to talk about a practical
dialog: next step.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Did you say ‘she’s not like that’?
dialog: You were with her one night and you
dialog: know her?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: She doesn’t do that. She hadn’t
dialog: for years. Afterwards she was sad.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Sad?
text: The call is cut by Katrina. Ivan takes a breath. He knows
text: how terrible he is at this. The phone rings almost
text: immediately. It is Donal. With Donal he is a different man.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I think we got cut off.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 39.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Ok. I have the file here.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I’m going to have to give you
dialog: information over the phone and you
dialog: are going to have to write it down,
dialog: ok?
dialog: A gulp...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Donal, are you drinking something?
dialog: What are you drinking?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
text: Bottle of fizzy pop.
text: Ivan reacts inside.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I need you to call the Duty Officer
dialog: at Belmount Police Station and
dialog: confirm the road closures for the
dialog: morning. You still have the pen?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Ivan finds solace in the formality of details. He
dialog: pronounces...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Ok, here are the roads we agreed
dialog: with the council need to be closed
dialog: to traffic for the duration of the
text: pour, from 5.25am to midday.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Shoot.
text: Ivan begins to recite from memory, staring ahead. He doesn’t
dialog: even need the file to remember...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Crescent Road between Arch Green
dialog: and Clearmount. Planetree Road at
dialog: the South end only...
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 40.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY 8
text: We cut to a gantry shot of Ivan’s car driving under bridges.
text: We hear Ivan’s voice delivering a monotone of overlapping
text: addresses with details of road closures. It is like a
text: soothing mantra. His car shoots through the night...
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER 9
text: Ivan completes his list.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: The Vale up to Parklands Farm Road
dialog: with stop-go operated by us.
dialog: You’1l need to quote the license
dialog: number...
text: Ivan consults a dimly lit sheet from the file...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Seven five zero slash DV. Ok?
text: A gulp.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Got it.
text: A pause...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Donal, it is fizzy pop you’re
dialog: drinking, yes?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: It is. It is.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Because if you’re on the fucking
dialog: cider and I find out, I will cut
dialog: your legs off with a pavement saw.
text: A pause. Donal decides to confront...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Now Ivan, there’s no need for you
dialog: to talk to me like that.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve got six calls stacked up on
dialog: this phone from Gareth and I’m
dialog: guessing what they are.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 41.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: But I agreed I’m not taking those
dialog: calls from Gareth because I’m
dialog: fucking shitting my pants here
dialog: about tomorrow going pear and I
dialog: don’t want him to give me some
dialog: fucking college kid construction
dialog: director on the phone trying to
dialog: talk me through this from scratch.
dialog: So, as far as I’m concerned, until
dialog: the sun comes up, yours is the only
dialog: voice I will listen to. But hear
dialog: this...
text: A pause, a gulp.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t go off threatening me, ok?
dialog: You have no official position to
dialog: threaten me from.
text: Ivan's expression doesn’t change but he has assessed Donal’s
dialog: words and realized...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: So. It is cider you’re drinking.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: One tin. So what?
text: Ivan reacts inside. He drives on. This is another hole in
text: the road but he adjusts quickly.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Eat something.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I’m not hungry. Now let me make my
dialog: call to the coppers and confirm
dialog: these road closures. Then I’‘1l
dialog: call you back for further
dialog: instruction. Over and out...
text: Donal cuts the call. Ivan holds it for a few seconds then
text: roars with anger. He hurls the file back onto the seat
text: beside him. He gets hold of himself.
text: He drives on. Thirty seconds pass. The phone rings and he
text: reads the name.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Bethan...
text: She sounds wistful and strange between the grunts of pain,
text: the effect of gas and air making her almost amused...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: They say there’s a twist.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 42.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
text: It’s round the baby’s neck like a
dialog: noose.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: You’re in the best place.
dialog: Honestly, you’re in the best place.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: They let me use my phone for one
dialog: minute...
text: She suddenly screams in agony. Ivan reacts.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: When will you get here?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Forty five minutes. I’m outside
dialog: Northampton. The traffic is ok.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: It's like waiting for God. Waiting
dialog: for Godot...
text: She laughs...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry. You’re not a theatre man...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Just do what they say...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: And not a reader of books and not a
dialog: talker. A builder. It’s funny
dialog: isn’t it...
text: She grunts in pain...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: That it was someone like you.
dialog: Someone so opposite to me. All the
dialog: things I love mean absolutely zero
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: The important thing is to get the
dialog: baby out.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Well the news is, they’re resorting
dialog: to knives.
text: She laughs...
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 43.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: By the sound of you, they are
dialog: giving you gas. Are they?...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: They think they might have to cut
dialog: me open because I’m too old to
dialog: push...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: That’s ok. They do it as routine.
dialog: It’s ok. It’s better in fact.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: In fact? Is that so?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: The traffic is ok.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: They're taking blood.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Just do what they say.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
text: Someone keeps opening the window.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Tell them you’re cold.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: They don’t listen. They talk
dialog: around me. I need somebody here to
dialog: speak for me.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I’ll be there...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: They said the umbilical cord is
dialog: like a noose. A lifeline and a
dialog: noose at the same time. That’s
dialog: funny isn’t it.
text: We hear other voices. The call is cut...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Bethan...
text: Silence. Ivan drives on. A minute goes by. Then he can’t
text: help himself and speaks softly to the rear view mirror...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: You think this is all fate don’t
dialog: you dad? Your dirty fucking finger
dialog: prints all over me.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 43A.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT'D)
dialog: It was bound to happen because of
dialog: the little seeds you planted.
dialog: Well, let me educate you. Let me
dialog: teach you something.
dialog: (MORE)
text: A pause.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 44,
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Even no matter what the situation
dialog: is, you can make it good. Like
dialog: with plaster and brick. You never
dialog: knew that because you never fucking
dialog: lifted a finger you lazy cunt but
dialog: you can take a situation and draw a
dialog: circle around it and find a way to
dialog: work something out.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: You don’t drive away from it. Sit
dialog: in the corner of some greasy little
dialog: fucking pub somewhere like you’re
dialog: the fucking happy maverick.
text: He drives.
text: A pause.
text: A pause.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I could come for you with a pick
dialog: and shovel, I really could, and dig
dialog: you up. And it would be a happy day
dialog: in hell because they would be rid
dialog: of you for a bit.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: You know what? I could just drive.
text: Around the M25 and then to Dover.
dialog: Or some fucking where. And not
dialog: face it. I could earn good money
text: cash-in-hand working on the cross
dialog: rail. They make five hundred a day
dialog: just shovelling shit. Yeah. But
dialog: I’m going to drive straight to the
dialog: worst place for me. The worst
dialog: place on earth for me to be. Even
dialog: though this woman is like...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
text: The woman is like, sad and lonely.
dialog: Hardly bothered with life at all.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I felt sorry for her. So how can
dialog: that be the difference between good
dialog: and bad?
text: The phone rings. We see ‘Home’. Ivan steels himself. A
text: scream.
dialog: Horror at first, then...
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 44a,
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: Are you listening to this?! Two
dialog: one to us. Two goals in three
dialog: minutes.
text: We hear another boy shouting in the background, celebrating a
text: goal, the sound of football on the TV.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad! Put it on the radio. It’s
dialog: brilliant...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Is your mother there?
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
text: She’s upstairs in the lavatory.
dialog: She’s been in there ages. She’s
dialog: wearing the shirt but she won’t
dialog: come down and watch. Shall I call
dialog: her?
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 45.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: No. Leave her. It’s ok. Enjoy the
dialog: game.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: It’s two one dad! We’re winning!
dialog: Why aren’t you going mad?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I am Eddie. I’m going mad inside
dialog: but I’m driving. I...
text: Ivan tries to continue but emotion takes his voice and he
dialog: cuts the call. He must adjust, must adjust, must adjust. He
text: picks up the file and flicks through some pages as he drives.
text: In the file he finds a number which he dials.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Hello, PC Davids? Yeah it’s Ivan
dialog: Locke from the Park project. I was
dialog: wondering if anyone had called you
dialog: about road closures?
speaker_heading: PC DAVIDS (OOV)
dialog: Yeah, we had some Irish guy. He
dialog: said he was standing in.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I’m just double checking the
dialog: closures are all confirmed, yes?
speaker_heading: PC DAVIDS (O00V)
dialog: No. There’s a problem with the Vale
dialog: stop and go. Council questioned
dialog: the licence at the last minute.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Shhhhit.
speaker_heading: PC DAVIDS (O0O0V)
dialog: I was going to call them in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Too late...
speaker_heading: PC DAVIDS (O0O0V)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: We have to control that road to get
dialog: the trucks in and out of the South
text: gate.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 46.
speaker_heading: PC DAVIDS (OOV)
dialog: You'll have to take it up with the
dialog: council.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
text: It’s nine o’clock...
speaker_heading: PC DAVIDS (O0O0V)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: The council offices are closed.
speaker_heading: PC DAVIDS (OO0V)
dialog: Yeah. But I can’t ratify until the
text: council sign off on the stop and
dialog: go...
dialog: Ivan must think fast.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Ok, ok, you'll get a call. How
dialog: long are you on duty?
speaker_heading: PC DAVIDS (OOV)
dialog: Another twenty five minutes.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: You'll get a call.
text: He cuts the call. Immediately Donal calls...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, we have a problem with the
dialog: stop and go...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I know, I just heard, I’m dealing
dialog: with it. In the meantime I need
dialog: you to go and check the shuttering
dialog: and get it signed off.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: The shuttering boys have all gone
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Even so you still have to check the
dialog: re-bars. Go and do it now. Take a
dialog: shovel and a pressure meter and a
text: torch and get into the holes.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Jesus...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I mean it.
dialog: 10
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 47.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: If this is just to stop me
dialog: drinking, you can fuck off.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I’m hoping your conscience will
dialog: stop you drinking. The shuttering
dialog: has to be checked. Go and do it.
text: He cuts the call. He thinks hard. He dials a mobile number
text: marked ‘Sean’. We hear the voice of a sixteen year old boy
dialog: (SEAN).
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Sean, it’s dad.
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: Dad, I can’t believe you’re not
dialog: here. It’s amazing. Two one.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I know. Sean, I need you to do me
dialog: a favor. There’s been a cock up and
dialog: I need to speak to someone. In my
dialog: blue coat in the kitchen there is a
text: notebook. There is a phone number
dialog: of somebody called Cassidy who
dialog: works for the council clerk of
dialog: works. I need the number...
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: Why don’t you ask mum?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Please just get the number and text
dialog: it to me. Cassidy. Under ‘C’.
dialog: It’s urgent.
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: Dad, is mum alright? She hasn’t
text: come down. It’s half time.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Sean, in the morning I will talk to
dialog: you about everything. Just get me
dialog: the number of Cassidy.
text: He cuts the call. He drives on and checks his watch. The

speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: This is Ivan Locke.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GULLU (OOV)

speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: And you're going to carry out a
dialog: Cesarian.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GULLU (OOV)
dialog: Yes, but Ms Maguire says she wants
dialog: to wait until you are here.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: She’s distressed. She’s quite an
dialog: odd person I think...
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 49.
text: The doctor takes the strange comment on board, but he’s seen
dialog: and heard many things in his job.
text: He drives.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GULLU (OOV)
dialog: Well, we really can’t wait. Where
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I‘’1l be half an hour.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GULLU (OOV)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: But if I hit traffic...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GULLU (OOV)
dialog: Exactly. So if we are to get her
dialog: to co-operate, we need you to speak
text: to her.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Of course. Put her on.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GULLU (OOV)
dialog: Can you hold the line?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
text: In call waiting he sees ‘Home’. He can’t cut the
text: call. He waits. Finally a sob down the line...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: They want to do it now...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Let them do it. I’ve said, let
dialog: them do it. It doesn’t matter if
dialog: I’m not there for the moment of
dialog: birth. I will still be there
dialog: before morning. It will be the
dialog: same day.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I’m on the motorway. Luton. Let
dialog: them do it. Don’t be silly...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (SUDDENLY) (OOV)
dialog: Fuck you!
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Bethan, your hormones will make you
dialog: scream but it’s better to get it
dialog: out.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 50.
text: Bethan is in agony and beyond reason...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: You know I told them it was one
dialog: night. I told them about the room
dialog: and feeling so sad after. But the
dialog: nurse said if he’s coming all the
dialog: way down, he must feel something.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: If it was just once and I get
dialog: pregnant it’s fate.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: You're distressed....
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: I told them I love you. Even if it
dialog: was just once.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (SOFTLY)
dialog: There’s no need to say that...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: It’ll be ours.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: How far away are you?
text: Ivan suddenly speaks solidly, in his concrete voice...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Bethan, I am telling you to let
dialog: them do what they have to do. A
dialog: baby is something that can’t be
dialog: stopped. You have to take all the
dialog: practical steps to prepare.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (SOFTLY) (OOV)
dialog: You want me to let them cut me
dialog: Open.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes. It is the best thing.
text: A long silence.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Ok. I will do it because I love
dialog: you.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 51.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Ok then.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: Can you not say it back even once?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: No I can’t. But I can be there as
text: fast as the traffic will allow.
text: Ivan cuts the call. He glares into the rear view...
text: He drives on. Ten seconds later he takes another call. He
text: sees the name ‘Home’. Before Ivan can speak...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: I just found Sean looking through
dialog: your pockets. He said you asked
dialog: him for a phone number.
dialog: Ivan has to adjust, adjust.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Now? At this moment? You need a
text: phone number.
text: Ivan is crushed into monotone.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I know how it looks but I need to
dialog: confirm a stop and go. Tomorrow
dialog: there is a pour. It is a big. It
dialog: is historical...
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: It is the biggest pour...
text: The hum of the engine.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Can you hear yourself, Ivan?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: I am falling apart at home and you
dialog: are closing roads?
text: Silence. Ivan is studying himself inside.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV) (CONT’D)
dialog: Some woman is giving birth and you
dialog: are closing roads.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 52.
text: A pause. Ivan is desperately twisted around inside and can’t
dialog: think and resorts to facts...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
text: It’s not a closure. It’s a stop and
dialog: go.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Since you told me about this woman,
dialog: you have been getting further and
dialog: further away from who I know. Or
dialog: it might be that I do know. In the
dialog: kitchen your footprints go hard and
dialog: I have to chip them away. You
dialog: leave concrete behind you
dialog: everywhere.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Katrina, I love you.
text: Silence. Then Katrina is crying...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I made one mistake.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t feel anything for this
dialog: woman but I am trying to do the
dialog: right thing tonight because she is
dialog: on her own and the baby is my fault
dialog: and I know how it feels to be
dialog: coming out into the world like
dialog: this.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
text: There’s someone being brought into
dialog: the world and it’s my fault so I
dialog: have to fix it somehow. There were
dialog: these two bottles of wine.
text: A long silence.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I would really like it if you would
dialog: say that you will wait and I can
dialog: come back up and we can talk about
dialog: it and that we can fix something
text: up.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 53.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: I really want to know that tomorrow
dialog: I can drive home and talk to the
dialog: boys and be at home as normal and
dialog: we can go out or something and have
dialog: a drink and talk about it. I want
dialog: to know that I’m not driving in one
dialog: direction. I want to know that I
dialog: will be driving back when the sun
text: comes up.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: Ivan? Let me ask you a question.
dialog: Do you still want me to give you
dialog: the phone number so you can close
dialog: the road?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (SOFTLY) (OOV)
dialog: Goodbye Ivan.
text: The call is cut. Ivan reacts. He drives on for a long time.
text: Donal calls and Ivan almost lets it ring off. But at the
dialog: last minute he must take the call.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I just did something on my own
dialog: initiative.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I found a mobile phone number for
text: the council guy who signs off the
dialog: closures.
text: Ivan is slowly astonished...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Cassidy?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: That’s him.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: You found his number?
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 54.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I knew you’d need it. I have his
dialog: mobile number. You took it over
dialog: Christmas in case. I found it ina
dialog: drawer.
text: Even through all his distress, Ivan is overwhelmed,
text: astounded.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Donal. You did that?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: And that’s on two tins of cider.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Ok, give me the number.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: 07700 900 957....
text: Ivan chokes on an unexpected emotion. The phone number hits
dialog: him hard for no reason. Does he really need this number.
text: But he repeats...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: 07700 900 557.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: No. 957. Are you writing it down?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: 07700 900 957.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Are you writing it down?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: No, it’s in my head...
text: Ivan cuts the call, then dials the number in his head
text: quickly, mumbling the digits, trying not to crumble. The
text: phone rings....
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Mr Cassidy? It’s Ivan Locke from
dialog: the Park project.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I’m running the site at Claremount.
dialog: We have some road closures
dialog: agreed...
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 55.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: How did you get this number?
text: Ivan’s ability to do this is weakening. The words of his
dialog: wife are crippling him, or dragging him back, but he must
dialog: push on...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: You gave it to me in case anything
dialog: came up over Christmas. I worked
dialog: over Christmas. I always work.
dialog: Every Christmas...
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: It’s not Christmas...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes, but I need a sign off...
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: I’m in an Indian restaurant...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: But I need a sign off. Really, you
dialog: know, seriously need it.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: I told you I’m in an Indian
dialog: restaurant.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: If I give you the number of the
dialog: duty officer at the Belmount police
dialog: station...
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: This will have to wait...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: Please. Please. Without this...
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (INTERRUPTING BACK) (OOV)
dialog: This will have to wait.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: It can’t wait. It can not wait.
dialog: Concrete is coming tomorrow morning
dialog: and nothing can stop it. I just
dialog: need you to call the duty officer
dialog: and...
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: I’m in a bloody Indian restaurant.
dialog: 12
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 56.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes. I’m sorry. But please. Just
dialog: call him and give him a sign off
text: over the phone on a stop-go on the
dialog: Vale. Five twenty five to midday.
text: A silence. Then Ivan sounds as if he is almost mocking
dialog: himself...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Pretty much everything depends on
dialog: it.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: You are Ivan Locke?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: I remember you.
text: Ivan wipes his eyes with his sleeve...
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You ran a tight ship.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: The only Construction Director who
dialog: gave us paperwork ahead of time.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes. But tonight things have
dialog: happened beyond my control.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: Ok, give me the bloody number.
text: Ivan sighs a deep sigh of relief and begins to read a number
dialog: out from memory...
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY BRIDGE 12
text: We see Ivan’s car pass beneath as he gives PC Davids name and
text: number to Cassidy. Ivan’s voice is a soft monotone as he
dialog: imparts information.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 57.
scene_heading: 13 INT. LAND ROVER 13
text: We study Ivan as he finishes the call.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: He'll leave his desk in five
dialog: minutes. Please call him and tell
dialog: him that you approve the stop go.
dialog: Then everything will be set.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (OOV)
dialog: I will. Hey. It’s late Ivan. You
dialog: work too hard.
text: Ivan cuts the call. We are seeing the outskirts of London
text: now. Ivan glances in the rear view as if he feels things
dialog: might just come together. Of course everything is broken but
text: he has his stop go and the baby is being dealt with. He
text: composes himself a little...
dialog: Then he speaks to his demon...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: You know I could easily have let
dialog: the concrete go to hell. I didn’t.
dialog: I took care of it.
text: A pause. Sudden anger...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: You know dad, when you came
dialog: creeping back saying you were
dialog: sorry, it was even worse than
dialog: staying away. Yeah. I’m serious.
dialog: I could have broken your fucking
dialog: back but I didn’t and the fact that
dialog: I could have done it was worse than
dialog: anything.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Because you were so fucking weak.
dialog: That was the first thing I noticed.
dialog: So weak. All the things I fucking
dialog: despise inside one fucking stupid
dialog: green shirt.
text: 
text: Ivan begins to laugh to himself. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: You looked pathetic. My fucking
dialog: dad in what were they? Trainers?
dialog: Some sort of fucking trainers that
dialog: teenagers wear. And your hair all
dialog: over the place. And you don’t
dialog: drink and you don’t smoke dope
dialog: anymore.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 57A.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT'D)
dialog: So everybody is supposed to
dialog: celebrate. Is that it? I
dialog: celebrate, right? Celebrate what?
dialog: (MORE )
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 58.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I was twenty three years old and
dialog: this old cunt comes from the
dialog: fucking blue sky and says, ‘guess
dialog: what’.
dialog: Donal calls...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, it’s all gone to hell.
text: Donal isn’t drunk but he’s been drinking.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
text: The re-bars in the shuttering in
dialog: pit six. They wouldn’t hold a
dialog: kittens fart. The fucking mavericks
dialog: from up north we put in at the last
dialog: minute.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: What tension did they hold?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Nothing at all. Came away with a
dialog: push.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Is there anybody there?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: The shutterers all went home ages
dialog: ago and they’re not in until six.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Call the Albanian.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
text: He’s not answering. Nobody is
dialog: answering. There’s some fucking
text: football game on.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Could you call in your sons?
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: They're in Germany digging out
text: missile silos.
text: Ivan takes all this on board. This is trouble but it’s
dialog: trouble he knows.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 59.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Ok, Donal here’s what you do. You
text: drive down to the ring road near
dialog: the fire station and you’ll see a
dialog: road gang laying lines. You ask
dialog: for a guy called Stefan. He’s
dialog: Polish. Tell him there’s five
dialog: hundred pounds for him and two of
dialog: his best diggers if they can get
dialog: down and fix up some re-bars.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: A road gang?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I know them. They’re slumming it
dialog: for the cash. But Stefan’s the
dialog: best concrete farmer I know.
dialog: Mention my name. He owes me.
text: A long pause. Donal hesitates...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: So do I have to drive down there?
dialog: Can I not just ring him?
text: Ivan reacts, reading between the lines...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: How many ciders have you had Donal?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Donal, I don’t have Stefan’s
dialog: number. You’ll need to drive down
dialog: there. They’1l be knocking off and
dialog: going home in half an hour.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, I’ll be straight with you.
dialog: I’m not drunk but I’ve had too much
dialog: to get behind a wheel. If I get
dialog: stopped again I go inside.
text: Ivan drives, thinks, checks his watch.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Ok, you run.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Run?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Stefan and his men will knock off
dialog: in half an hour due to council
dialog: regulations because they can’t burn
text: bitumen lights after ten.
dialog: (MORE )
text: A pause.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 60.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT'D)
dialog: If you run you’ll get there before
text: they get in their van.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: What do you mean run? I don’t
dialog: fucking run.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: You will run Donal.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I haven’t run since I was eight.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: You will run. Now. Go. Or my
dialog: building won’t get built.
text: Then Donal laughs.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Run? Are you mad?
text: After a moment Ivan laughs too...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes. Tonight I’ve gone mad and I
dialog: will have to get used to being mad.
dialog: And, Donal, I can hear in your
dialog: voice you’re drunk. When you're
dialog: drunk you can run faster for a
dialog: while. You can run like a kid.
dialog: Like the fucking wind.
text: Donal laughs some more...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I’ll get out of my boots and put on
dialog: my trainers shall I...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes. Then you run.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: What? I run for bastards in Chicago
dialog: who don’t care if I live or die.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: No, you do it for the piece of sky
dialog: we are stealing with our building.
dialog: You do it for the air that will be
dialog: displaced. Most of all you do it
dialog: for the concrete, because it is
dialog: delicate as blood.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: You really have gone fucking mad.
dialog: 14
dialog: 15
dialog: 16
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 61.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: That would be a fair assessment.
text: Donal whoops.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Here I go!
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Good man Donal. You’re a good man.
dialog: Now run.
text: Ivan cuts the call. He laughs madly for a few moments and
text: bangs the steering wheel three times. The tears of laughter
text: almost turn to tears of despair but he fights them. He
dialog: drives on and on.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY 14
text: We see a sign for the M25 exit. Ivan drives by. He is
dialog: almost in London.
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER 15
text: Ivan drives. He is red eyed, grim, hunched at the wheel. He
text: glances at the rear view and speaks to his father...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: It will work out. I will make sure
dialog: of it. You see. You take things
dialog: in your own hands and you push
text: against it until it is upright.
text: Ivan almost arrogantly hits a number...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: And you stick to the plan.
text: He dials a number...
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY GANTRY 16
text: We see Ivan driving under the bridge and hear a phone call in
dialog: voiceover....
speaker_heading: BETHAN ANSWER MESSAGE (OOV)
dialog: This is Bethan, I can’t get to the
dialog: phone right now, please leave a
text: message after the tone.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (OOV)
dialog: Bethan, it’s me. I know they’re

speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (OOV) (CONT’D)
dialog: Good luck Bethan. This baby is a

scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER 17
text: Ivan cuts the call and glares into the rear view mirror.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: You see, dad. Life.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Yeah. Life sentence. So what? I
dialog: will do what needs to be done even
dialog: if they hate me or love me. You
dialog: have to be solid so that it makes
dialog: no difference what they think.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: If I were to bury you again tonight
dialog: before I threw the dirt on your
dialog: face I’d say look and fucking
dialog: learn. I drove in this direction.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: And there'll be a new person when I
dialog: get there. Yes. Because of that
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
text: Constructed out of two bottles of
dialog: wine and somebody feeling lonely.
dialog: How could you ever beat that for a
dialog: construction?
text: Ivan drives. He almost bounces with defiance now. He checks
text: his watch. He gets a call and takes it...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Sean?
speaker_heading: SEAN (SUBDUED) (OOV)
dialog: Hey dad. We won.
text: From the small changes in the voice, Ivan knows that Sean has
dialog: heard something about what is happening. However...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: What was the score?
text: A pause.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: Three one.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Good.

speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: Caldwell, Robinson and Caldwell
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Good. Is everything ok?
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know. Mum looks like she’s
dialog: seen a ghost. She broke some
dialog: plates.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yeah. Something’s happened. I/’11
dialog: explain when I’m not driving.
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: She’s upstairs.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yeah, I’1l explain when I’m not
dialog: driving and when I’m with you and
dialog: Eddie together. I’ve only just
dialog: explained it to myself.
text: A long silence.
text: He drives.
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: She said you’re not coming home
dialog: ever.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: She’s distressed.
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: Are you coming home?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Where else would I go?
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: So I'll tell Eddie that you are
text: coming home. He’s been crying.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 64.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Look, when I get to the other end,
dialog: I’ll call. Sean, you tell Eddie
dialog: that it’s ok. I’11 make it ok.
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: It doesn’t feel like it’s ok. It
dialog: felt different after half time.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I‘ll fix it. It will all go back
dialog: to normal. You should go to bed.
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: Yeah.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV) (CONT’D)
dialog: The third goal was amazing.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Caldwell?
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: He took it round the keeper.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Good God. Caldwell’s a donkey.
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)
dialog: He is normally a donkey but tonight
dialog: he was brilliant.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: A miracle. Good night.
speaker_heading: SEAN (OOV)

speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE

text: and calls Donal. The call is answered and we hear rasping,
text: gasping breaths...
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: You know I nearly got fucking run
text: down by a taxi running across a
dialog: road.
text: He can hardly speak as he fights for breath.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Did you find Stefan?
dialog: Ivan cuts
dialog: at the rea
dialog: more gentl.
text: He drives.
text: He drives.
text: A pause.
text: He drives.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 65.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
text: I see the flames. They’re burning
dialog: the road. I can smell the bitumen.
dialog: It's getting in my throat.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: His name is Stefan. Five hundred
dialog: each.
speaker_heading: DONAL (BREATHLESS) (OOV)
dialog: Man Ivan, I’m fucked.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: And sober. Tell Stefan to bring two
dialog: men and a jack. Five hundred a
dialog: piece.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I‘1l call when I have the Poles in
dialog: my grasp. Fuck. My heart is
text: coming out of my chest.
text: the call. He half smiles as he drives. He glances
dialog: xr view and speaks to his father’s ghost a little
dialog: y now...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Stefan is a good man and will fix
dialog: the pit and check the others. All
dialog: twelve pumps will work. The stop-go
dialog: will run. The north, south, east
dialog: and west gates will all take their
text: quarter of concrete. The baby will
dialog: be born.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: And Katrina will be ok. In the
dialog: morning she will be ok.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: That is how it can be.
text: He glances at the file on the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: That is my prayer.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: And this baby when he’s seven, or
dialog: when she’s seven, it'll say it’s
dialog: ok. And the name will be Locke.
text: A pause.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 66.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Locke is ok. We do ok. Because I
dialog: straightened the name out. The
dialog: Lockes were a long line of shit but
dialog: I straightened the name out.
text: He seems unsure as he dares glance in the rear view mirror
dialog: once more.
text: A pause.
text: He drives.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: But you know what, you old bastard?
dialog: I know now why you ran away.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: And if you want you can run away
dialog: again. Fuck off.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Or you can stay. What difference
dialog: would it make to me?
text: The rear view fills with headlights as if in response. We
dialog: stay with
text: Ivan for a long time. His phone rings and Ivan
text: takes the call with confidence.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: ok, I’m in a van with three Poles
text: who smell like burning rooftops.
dialog: They said six hundred each and I
dialog: guessed you’d say yes.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: This guy Stefan don’t say much,
dialog: does he?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: He’s a good man.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: You want a word with him?
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: No. Stefan knows what to do.
dialog: You'll be ok now Donal. Fix up the
dialog: re-bars and start preparing the
dialog: gates. It will be a long night.
dialog: A laugh...
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: I’m stone cold sober now.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: I know. It all worked out.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV)
dialog: Stefan just said to say hello to
dialog: Ivan Locke.
dialog: 66A.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 67.
speaker_heading: DONAL (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: He says you're the best man in
dialog: England.
text: Ivan smiles and cuts the call. He dares to look relieved.
text: He checks his watch. The motorway into London is brightly
text: lit. The phone rings. He sees ‘Home’ and hesitates before
text: taking the call.
speaker_heading: KATRINA
dialog: I've decided.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Kat, you know what? We can work
dialog: this out, I know we can.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: I’ve spoken to my sister and my
dialog: half sister.
text: Ivan is expressionless but this is bad news...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: The difference between ‘once’ and
dialog: ‘never’ is everything. That’s it.
dialog: And it is never ‘once’ anyway.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Katrina...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: I don’t want you to come back Ivan.
dialog: This is not your home anymore. I
dialog: want you to stay away.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Katrina...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV)
dialog: We will make arrangements for
dialog: seeing the boys. My sister says
dialog: every Wednesday is normal.
dialog: Ivan can’t speak...
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV) (CONT’D)
dialog: But I don’t want you coming here.
dialog: You were always more in love with
dialog: your buildings anyway. Why don’t
dialog: you go and live in one of them?
dialog: Right at the top where you like to
dialog: look out and feel so pleased with
dialog: yourself. I’m going to wash
dialog: everything here. Wash it all ten
dialog: times to get the dust of you out of
dialog: it.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: 18
dialog: 19
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 68.
speaker_heading: KATRINA (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: I won’t have to deal with your foot
text: prints turning to stone on the
dialog: kitchen floor anymore. It’s
dialog: finished. This isn’t your home.
text: She cuts the call. Ivan drives on. He looks into his rear
text: view mirror. The brief moment when he believed things might
text: work out has gone. He must adjust again. He begins to slow
dialog: down...
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY GANTRY 18
text: In CCTV we see Ivan’s car crawling in the slow lane as the
text: rest of the traffic overtakes and shoots by. His car looks
dialog: like a wounded animal...
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER 19
text: Ivan stares ahead as he drives. Then he glances in his rear
text: view. For the first time we see tears in his eyes. He wipes
text: them away with his sleeve. His phone rings.
text: He drives. The phone rings on and finally Ivan takes the
dialog: call...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (SOFTLY)
dialog: Ivan Locke.
text: Gareth sounds distraught and speaks fast...
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, I’ve put a construction
dialog: director onto this and he’s tried
dialog: to reach Donal a hundred times but
text: Donal isn’t picking up.
text: Ivan doesn’t speak.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you there Ivan?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Can you reach Donal and tell him he
text: must pick up his phone immediately.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Ivan?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Tell your construction director
dialog: there is no need to speak to Donal.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 69.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything is already taken care
dialog: of...
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, for fuck’s sake...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (OVER HIM)
dialog: Everything is taken care of and
dialog: everything is ready for 5.25.
dialog: There will be no mistakes. I have
dialog: made sure everything is in place.
dialog: You can go to sleep Gareth.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: I actually threw up earlier.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Fucking yeah.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (OVER HIM)
dialog: Well, hear this Gareth. When I
dialog: left the site just over 2 hours ago
dialog: I had a job, a wife, a home.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Now I have none of those things.
text: A pause...
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D)
dialog: It is ten fifteen and I have none
dialog: of those things left. I just have
dialog: myself and the car I’min. I’m
dialog: just driving. That’s it.
dialog: Silence. Then...
speaker_heading: GARETH (OOV)
dialog: Ivan, you fucked up your life,
dialog: that’s your business, but Chicago
text: is going insane.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Two words I learnt tonight. ‘Fuck
dialog: Chicago’.
text: Ivan cuts the call. He drives and we stay with him for a
text: long time. A minute goes by. Then a call comes in and Ivan
text: reads ‘unknown’. As the call rings, Ivan decides he cannot
text: take it. His voicemail message clicks in.
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 70.
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE’S VOICEMAIL (OOV)
dialog: This is Ivan Locke. Please leave a
dialog: message.
text: Ivan hears the voice of Eddie and Eddie leaves a message.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV)
dialog: Dad, I’m on my mobile. I’m under
dialog: the duvet. I wanted to tell you
text: about the goal.
text: Eddie is fighting a terrible upset by trying to behave the
dialog: way he behaved before this happened.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Caldwell got it and he controlled
dialog: it. You know how you always shout
dialog: at him because it always flies off
dialog: him and out into the crowd? Well,
dialog: he controlled it.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: And he got it down on the ground.
dialog: You know how you say he just lumps
dialog: it forward all the time, well he
dialog: got it down on the ground. This is
dialog: Caldwell, dad. And he just started
dialog: running...
text: Eddie begins to laugh and cry at the same time...
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: And he was running and running and
dialog: running and these defenders were
text: bouncing off him.
text: Eddie laughs...
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: And he went round one, then
dialog: another, and me and Sean were
text: standing up and shouting at him to
dialog: pass the ball. You know how you
dialog: say you have to square it. He
dialog: wouldn’t square it. He wouldn’t
dialog: pass. He just kept running. He
dialog: looked like a horse or something.
text: Eddie laughs again.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: So then the goalie is coming
dialog: forward and we think he’s going to
dialog: boot it over the bar. Remember
dialog: against whoever it was when he just
text: booted it over the bar.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 71.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: We thought it was going to be that
dialog: again. But he didn’t. This is
dialog: Caldwell dad. The one you say is
dialog: always a donkey.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: He went round the goalie and put it
dialog: in.
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: Mum was crying so she didn’t even
dialog: see it.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: But we recorded it for you so you
dialog: have to come home to watch it.
dialog: You’1ll have to come home and I’ve
dialog: had an idea. We'll pretend we
dialog: don’t know the score and pretend
dialog: it’s happening then. Pretend it’s
dialog: live. And me and Sean will go mad
dialog: the same. You can have the beer
dialog: and mum can make the sausages.
text: A pause. Eddie concludes quickly.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (OOV) (CONT'D)
dialog: So that’s what we’1ll do. Good night
dialog: dad.
text: The call is cut. Ivan drives on. He drives for a long time
text: and wipes his eyes with his sleeve.
text: Then his phone rings. We see ‘Unknown’. Ivan hesitates then
text: takes the call.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (HISSING) (OOV)
dialog: Ivan?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Is it ok?
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV)
dialog: It’s a boy.
text: Ivan reacts.
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV) (CONT’D)
dialog: Listen...
dialog: 20
dialog: Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 72.
text: We hear the sound of a baby crying down the phone. The thin
text: sound fills the car and Ivan lets the car slow down on its
text: own. Horns hoot and Ivan drifts onto the hard shoulder.
text: The car comes to a halt. The sound of the baby crying
text: continues. Ivan knocks the car out of gear and switches off
text: the engine. A silence around the sound of the baby crying.
text: Ivan listens and glances in the rear view mirror. Then he
text: puts his head on the steering wheel and the sound of the baby
text: crying continues.
text: He sits with his head on the steering wheel for a long time.
dialog: Then...
speaker_heading: BETHAN (OOV) (CONT’D)
dialog: Ivan, will you come?
speaker_heading: IVAN LOCKE
dialog: Yes.
text: He cuts the call. He is alone in silence for a few moments.
dialog: Was the birth of a new life worth the destruction of his own?
dialog: Is there redemption in this moment? Ivan doesn’t have an
text: answer. After a moment he fires the engine.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTORWAY GANTRY 20
text: From a surveillance camera we see Ivan’s car indicate then
text: pull out into the traffic. After Ivan’s car has gone, we
text: watch the other cars on their own journeys, all of them with
text: their own stories inside their bubbles of light.
speaker_heading: THE END
