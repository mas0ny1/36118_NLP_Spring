speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: We have reason to believe that the

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Cunth.
speaker_heading: FAITH

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: But they’1l be looking for those
dialog: next.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Oh, will they, Rookie?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It is imperative that they do not

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I’m not gonna lie to you. This is

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: It’s good to see you, Vicki.
text: MacGruber leaves. When he’s out the door, she opens up the
text: piece of paper. Scribbled in very poor handwriting: “I’m at

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

text: Piper’s nose is bandaged. Faith talks on a cell phone.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yes, Mr. President, I understand.
dialog: (to MacGruber)
text: One second, Grubes.
dialog: MacGruber nods: take your time.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: How’s your nose, Rookie?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Up yours.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I forget. The last time I saw you,
dialog: did I remember to tell you how ugly
dialog: I think you are?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: No, you didn’t.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Well, I think you’re really ugly.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Well, I think you’re looking in the
dialog: mirror.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You wanna go?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Anytime, anyplace.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I’m starting to like this guy...
dialog: just kidding. I still hate you.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Well, I hate you.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You wanna go?!
text: MacGruber pushes Piper. Piper pushes back. Faith hangs up.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Guys, cool it! So MacGruber, we
dialog: hear you’ve recruited quite a team.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Quite a team? Yeah, you could say
dialog: that. Frank Korver, Tanker Lutz,
dialog: Tut Beemer, Tug Phelps, Vernon
dialog: Freedom, moi. Yeah, I’d say it’s a
dialog: pretty good team.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Look, I’1l cut to the chase. Are
dialog: you sure you won’t change your mind
dialog: about letting Piper here join the
dialog: team? He could be quite an asset.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Oh, I would love to, but the van’s
dialog: pretty full. See, it’s filled with
dialog: American heroes with over a hundred
dialog: years of combined combat experience
dialog: and a whole lot of brotherhood --
dialog: and that’s stuff you can’t get ina
dialog: simulator, Rookie. So thanks for
dialog: the offer, but I would never work
dialog: with you in a million fucking
dialog: years. And no, you can’t ride in
text: the trunk, because the trunk is
text: filled with over 75 pounds of high-
dialog: grade C4 explosive and about 3000
dialog: loose rounds of hollow point--
text: The van EXPLODES into a million pieces. Debris rains
text: everywhere. Sporadic pops of hollow-point bullets go off
text: like popcorn.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Oh fuck! Oh no! No. This is not
dialog: happening. Oh...
text: MacGruber runs over to the van and starts searching through
text: the sea of twisted metal and body parts.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Oh no no no no no no no no.
dialog: Tanker? Vernon? Anyone? Tut?
dialog: Tug? You guys okay? Oh God, no!

speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: They were nice funerals.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yeah. What'd you think of my
dialog: eulogies?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: They were very...touching. I might
dialog: have cut down on the F-words a
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Well, they were fucking great guys.
dialog: And this is a fucking asshole of a
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I know. It’s just that their kids
dialog: were there.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: They left.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Because of your use of heavy
dialog: language.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I should have been in that van.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: But you weren’t.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No, I wasn’t. And nobody’s gonna
dialog: regret that more than Cunth.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: MacGruber, about that. Look, I’m
dialog: taking you off the case.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I’m sorry, I must have heard wrong.
dialog: Because I thought I just heard you
dialog: say “MacGruber, about that. Look,
dialog: I’m taking you off the case.”
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I did. Verbatim.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Goddamn it, Jim, you can’t do that!
dialog: I gotta see this thing through.
dialog: I’m the best chance you got! You
dialog: told me yourself at the monastery!
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: But the game has changed!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: But the players are the same!
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I don’t like this any better than
dialog: you, but you’ve been through a very
dialog: traumatic experience. You’re too
text: close. And without a team behind
dialog: you, I just can’t chance it. I’m
dialog: sorry, Grubes.
text: Faith exits. MacGruber looks out the window, bummed. Piper
text: enters.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Sir, I--
dialog: (noticing MacGruber)
dialog: Oh. It’s you. Look MacGruber, I’m
dialog: sorry for your loss.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Piper, you gotta help me. They

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Well, under the circumstances--
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Fuck you, dickhead!
text: Piper turns to exit.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Wait, wait, wait! I didn’t mean

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What do you want, MacGruber?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Join my team.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Join my new team and tell the

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I can’t do that.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Okay, don’t make me beg here. Cuz
dialog: I will do it.
dialog: (starts breaking down)
dialog: I’m so sorry. I’m so goddamn
dialog: sorry. Look, I’m freaking out
dialog: here. I killed them. I killed

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Look, I will suck your dick. I
dialog: will suck your fucking dick. I
dialog: will do it, just join my team.
dialog: I’1l suck your dick. You can fuck
dialog: me or get fucked by me. You can
dialog: watch me fuck something. Just
dialog: point at something, I’1l fuck it
dialog: for you. Just tell me what you

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Jesus Christ, MacGruber.
text: Piper shuts the door then turns back to see MacGruber with
text: his pants off, braced for a fucking against the desk.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Okay, I don’t have any lubricant.
dialog: Do you see any white-out? Or like
dialog: copy toner should work.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Jesus Christ, put your pants back
dialog: on. What the fuck are you doing?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I don’t know! I don’t know what

dialog: 25.
text: MacGruber crumples to the ground, crying -- it’s a pitiful
text: sight. Piper actually feels kind of sorry for him.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Come on, MacGruber. It’s not so
dialog: bad.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: It’s not? The man who killed my
dialog: wife is in control of a nuclear
dialog: warhead and I can’t do a goddamn
dialog: thing about it and it’s not so bad?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Cunth killed your wife?
text: MacGruber nods.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I’m sorry. I didn’t know.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Well, it’s not the kind of thing
dialog: you broadcast. Every time I hear
dialog: his name or see his face, I think
dialog: of what he did to Casey and what he
dialog: took away from me. And I don’t
dialog: want that to happen to anybody
dialog: else.
text: Piper is deep in thought. Faith enters.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: MacGruber, we have a chopper ready
dialog: to take you back to Ecuador.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Well, Colonel. Sorry I let you
text: down. Piper.
text: MacGruber nods to Piper. Piper can see the pain in
text: MacGruber’s eyes. MacGruber turns for the door.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I’m in.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Lieutenant--
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I’m in, I'm on the team.
text: MacGruber turns back. He can’t believe what he’s hearing.

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: FAITH

speaker_heading: VICKI (0.S.)

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: FAITH

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What are we doing here, MacGruber?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: It's simple, Vicki. Cunth owns
dialog: this place. If we wanna find where
dialog: the passcode deal is going down, we
dialog: gotta turn over some stones.
text: A guy drives by in a Honda Civic.
speaker_heading: DUDE (0.C.)

speaker_heading: BARTENDER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yeah, I’1l have the X5.

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

text: He doesn’t know anything.
dialog: (to entire club)
dialog: Turn off the music. Turn off the
dialog: music!
text: MacGruber jumps onstage, grabs a microphone and puts Vicki in
text: a headlock.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
text: TURN OFF THE FUCKING MUSIC OR I
text: WILL KILL THIS WOMAN!
text: The DJ turns off the music. MacGruber lets Vicki go.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Don’t worry. She’s with me, she’s
dialog: safe. But I can’t say the same for
dialog: the rest of you.
text: MacGruber throws a bottle against the wall.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Now I’m sure some of you guys are
dialog: just here on vay-cay. But most of

dialog: Cunth? Nobody? Yeah, I wouldn’t
dialog: want to admit it either if I was
text: working for an ENEMY OF THE UNITED
scene_heading: STATES OF AMERICA--
dialog: 28.
text: MacGruber throws the mic at the bar. A few bottles break.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: --who also happens to kill peoples’
dialog: wives, he killed mine. That’s
dialog: right. This guy is up to something
dialog: incredibly illegal and astoundingly
dialog: deadly “allegedly,” I should say
dialog: that for legal purposes. I can’t
dialog: tell you what it is because it is
dialog: top secret, but rest assured many
dialog: of you and your family members will
dialog: die as a result. But don’t worry,
dialog: cuz I am coming for him and I am
dialog: going to kill him. Who am I? My
dialog: name is MacGruber. Remember that
scene_heading: name. Capital M-A-C-Capital G-R-U-
dialog: B-E-R.
text: MacGruber turns over a table.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
text: To my right is Vicki with an ‘i’

dialog: Throw the bottle.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: No.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: And Lieutenant Dixon Piper. We are
dialog: the people who are going to stop
dialog: Dieter Von Cunth from using his
dialog: “alleged” nuclear bomb, I did not
dialog: say that. Anyone wants to find me,
dialog: I will be at the Java Hut tomorrow
dialog: at 2:00pm. Have a great evening.
dialog: (to bartender)
dialog: Excuse me, is there a security
dialog: camera here?
text: The bartender points to a camera. MacGruber flips it off
text: with both hands and exits. Vicki and Piper follow.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY WAY -- NIGHT
text: MacGruber tries to walk off the adrenaline.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Woo! That went great.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: MacGruber, what the hell was that?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: What? We were sending a message.
dialog: And I think it will be received
text: loud and clear.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yeah, that’s what I’m worried
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: He thought you were dead. That was
dialog: a huge advantage. Now he’ll be
dialog: coming for us.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Exactly, it’s all part of the plan.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What is the plan?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Well, I kind of make it up as I go.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: That’s not really a plan then.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Okay, so it’s not a plan. Look,
dialog: I’m not good with plans. And I’m
dialog: not good with clues. What I am
dialog: good with is kicking ass and
dialog: ripping throats. So Cunth is gonna
dialog: come after me? Well, bring it the
dialog: fuck on. Cuz then he’ll be on my
dialog: turf, playing my game, and that’s
dialog: not a game I plan on losing.

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Gotcha! Pretty good, huh?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Can we talk about this please?
text: MacGruber starts sprucing her up.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: There’s nothing to talk about.
dialog: Everybody knows rats like cheese.

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: But why can’t you be the cheese?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Because I’m the rat trap.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (not okay)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: It’s just, usually the rat eats a
dialog: little bit of the cheese before the
text: trap is sprung.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Ha. Oh Vicki.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I gotta say, I have serious
dialog: concerns about this operation.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Then there’s the goddamn door.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: No, I’m just concerned about
dialog: Vicki's safety.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: If you think I’d let that monster
text: Cunth touch a hair on Vicki’s head,
dialog: then you’re sorely mistaken.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
text: He’1l get close to her, possibly
dialog: dangerously close. And of course,
dialog: in this line of business, anything
dialog: can happen. But I know that Vicki
dialog: can take care of herself. Now, you
dialog: ready?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Don’t worry, when you turn around
text: at gunpoint and they see that it’s
dialog: not me, they are gonna be so
dialog: furious, they’re not gonna know
dialog: what to do. And that’s when we got
dialog: ‘em.

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER (0.S.)

speaker_heading: CASHIER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER (0.S.)

text: They look at each other for a beat. We sense that there
text: could be something there. Piper clears his throat.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh, sorry.
text: Vicki gives Piper a cordial hug.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Hoss Bender happened. And now he
dialog: happens to be dead. Our little
dialog: charade worked perfectly.
text: Piper and Vicki share a glance.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You guys get any intel on the X5?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No, but we did get these.
text: MacGruber holds up car keys. They hear an approaching siren.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: We better get this van off the
dialog: street.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
text: As many sirens wail in the background, MacGruber, Piper and
text: Vicki walk along the sidewalk. MacGruber presses the alarm
text: button until he finally hears a chirp from a black Cadillac.
scene_heading: EXT. CADILLAC - DAY
text: Vicki and Piper open a duffle bag in the trunk, revealing
dialog: hundreds of thousands of dollars.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Oh mama, that’s a whole lot of
dialog: Wampum.
text: Piper walks over holding a GPS system.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: He’s got like every strip club in
dialog: the city programmed in here.
text: Vicki holds up a leather bound organizer.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: That’s weird, he’s got an
dialog: appointment this afternoon and all
dialog: it says is STD. STD. Does that
dialog: mean anything to you?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Unless I’m mistaken, STD is an old
dialog: railroad code.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: That’s what it means to me too.
dialog: Railroads.
speaker_heading: PIPER
text: The old Stansfield rail yard is
dialog: located about ten miles from here.
dialog: Let me pop that into this GPS.
dialog: (enters code)
dialog: Well, what do you know. It’s
text: already routed.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: What do you say we go get ourselves
dialog: some passcodes?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: But if Hoss doesn’t show up,
text: they’1l abort the drop.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Who said Hoss isn’t gonna show up?
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC -- DAY
text: Vicki drives dressed up like Hoss Bender -- clothes and wig.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Why do I have to be Hoss?
text: MacGruber sits shotgun.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Because you’re good at what you do.
dialog: 40.
text: Piper sits in the back seat dressed up as MacGruber in his
text: clothes and wig.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: And why do I have to be you?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Look Piper, I’m running the show
dialog: around here. So when I give an
dialog: order, you will follow it with a
dialog: smile on your face and a big “yes
dialog: sir.” All right?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: (smiles fakely)
dialog: Yes sir.
text: MacGruber points at him, impressed.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL YARDS -- DAY
text: From behind industrial equipment, MacGruber, Vicki, and Piper
text: scope out a warehouse. Two guards are on either side of the
text: entrance, a third on the roof -- all have sub-machine guns.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Looks like there are three guards
text: here and two at the south entrance.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: So if we take these three guards
dialog: out of the equation?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Then it’s three on two, we’ll have
dialog: the advantage.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Well, keep in mind, one of our
text: three is a woman.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Thanks, MacGruber.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No, I meant that in a good way.
dialog: You count as like one and a half
dialog: people.
text: MacGruber shoots a look at Piper which shows that he doesn’t
dialog: truly mean it.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: So once we take out the guards,
text: Vicki will drive in dressed as Hoss
dialog: and we'll just see what happens.
dialog: You ready?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: So we’re just gonna wing it?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: That’s the plan.
text: Vicki has a look of terror on her face.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Again, that’s not a--
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Piper?!
text: Piper smiles through gritted teeth.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Okay, let’s do this thing.
text: Piper loads clips into two handguns and passes one to
dialog: MacGruber.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: MacGrubie don’t play like homey.
dialog: And homey don’t play like that.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: So it’s true what they say about
dialog: you. You don’t use guns.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Guns are for the weak. Guns are
dialog: for the stupid. No offense.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: But these men are trained soldiers.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Look, you’re more than welcome to
dialog: use your guns. But me? I’m gonna
dialog: use this.
text: MacGruber points to his brain, then looks inside a dumpster.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Let’s see, what do we got here?
text: MacGruber grabs a bunch of things and places them in front of
text: him. The items: a carrot, bug spray, copper wire, some
text: brads, a tar shingle, a pine cone and a dirty old salad bowl.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
text: Making a little distraction.
text: MacGruber peels the carrot with his Swiss Army Knife.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: Three guards stand watch. Suddenly, an odd noise is heard
text: echoing off the buildings.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: What the hell is that?
text: The guards look around, guns at the ready. The noises get
dialog: louder.
text: GUARD POV - looking left and right around the deserted rail
text: yard, finally the camera pans up to find MacGruber on the
text: roof of a small building, dancing around completely naked
text: (except for his boots) with a carrot in his ass.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: What the fuck?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Now!
text: Piper jumps up from behind a dumpster. He sees MacGruber and
text: is temporarily stunned.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Now! Now!
text: Piper finally snaps to it and shoots the three men with a
text: silencer and then runs over to MacGruber.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I gotta admit, it worked.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yeah, you do have to admit it. And
dialog: you know who else has to admit it?
dialog: Those three dead guys.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: They’re dead because I shot them.
text: As MacGruber gets dressed:
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Because they were distracted. Now,
dialog: piece of advice, you ever try this,
dialog: you’re gonna wanna go with the
dialog: thick end -- seems counter-
dialog: intuitive, but...
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Look, you're wasting your time.
dialog: I’m never ever gonna do that.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Never ever say never ever. Okay,
dialog: follow me.
text: MacGruber and Piper sneak into the warehouse.
scene_heading: INT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: As Zeke and Constantine wait for Hoss, a BODYGUARD stands by
text: a Hummer protecting a MAN IN A SUIT who holds a BRIEFCASE.
text: From a catwalk, MacGruber and Piper look on.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: That’s Constantine Bach and Zeke
dialog: Pleshette.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: And if I’m not mistaken -- which I
dialog: never am -- that briefcase-carrying
text: motherfuck has the passcodes.
dialog: (into wrist mic)
dialog: Okay Vicki, it’s go time.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: Vicki waits in the Cadillac, still dressed as Hoss.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Do I really have to do this?
scene_heading: INT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: MacGruber talks into wrist mic.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yes, Vicki, you really do. Now
dialog: start that car.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: Vicki reluctantly starts the car and drives slowly toward the
dialog: warehouse.
scene_heading: INT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: MacGruber talks into the wrist mic.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Vicki, America thanks you for your
dialog: bravery. And if for some reason,
dialog: you don’t make it out of this, at
dialog: some point, I’1l let America know
dialog: what you did today and I’m sure
dialog: you'll get a posthumous medal, or a
dialog: certificate at the very least.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: Vicki drives, freaked out as MacGruber continues talking.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER (0.S.)
dialog: And I will make sure you get a full
dialog: military burial. Got ‘em for those
dialog: other guys, I can get one for you.
dialog: Okay, I can see your lights now.
dialog: Just keep driving in slowly and
dialog: let’s see what happens.
scene_heading: INT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: MacGruber leans over to Piper.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: This is so exciting.
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: Vicki's very close to the entrance now. MacGruber continues.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER (0.S.)
text: Now head through the entrance.
dialog: Slowly. Don’t worry. Remember,
dialog: they think you’re Hoss Bender so
dialog: it’s gonna take them a little--
text: The moment the car enters:
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: That’s not Hoss!
text: The men immediately spray the car with bullets. Vicki ducks
text: down, puts the car in reverse, slams her foot on the
text: accelerator, and hauls ass out of the warehouse.
speaker_heading: SFX: CRASH!
text: From the catwalk, Piper opens fire on the men. He shoots and
text: kills the bodyguard as MacGruber starts to mix some sort of
text: concoction together in the salad bowl.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Making a homemade grenade!
text: Constantine opens fire on the catwalk. Piper manages to kill
text: the man with the briefcase. Zeke grabs the case and runs.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Can I borrow your gun? I need
dialog: something to stir this with!
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: No, I’m using it right now! Use
dialog: your finger!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Watch your fucking tone!
text: Piper aims at ZEKE and pulls the trigger: CLICK! No bullets.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Shit!
text: From an ANKLE HOLSTER Piper draws a .38 SNUB NOSE revolver,
text: aims at Zeke in the distance, takes a deep breath and...
text: BLAM! Shoots Zeke in the head, killing him.
dialog: 46.
text: Constantine grabs the case and slips out of the warehouse.
text: Piper chases after him. MacGruber follows, stirring the
text: ingredients in the bowl with his finger.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: Piper and MacGruber run to the back entrance just in time to
text: see Constantine jump into a car and speed away. Piper fires
text: at him but he’s too far away.
text: MacGruber takes a gooey pine cone out of the bowl, takes a
text: match out of his vest pocket, lights the pine cone and then
text: throws it in the direction of the car. But the pine cone
text: only goes about twenty feet and then stops. After a beat:
speaker_heading: SFX: POP!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Goddamn it! That’s why you can’t
dialog: stir with your finger, cuz then
dialog: your hand’s too sticky to get ina
dialog: good throw.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Oh God, Vicki!
text: The guys sprint away.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: They race to the crashed Cadillac. They fling open the door
text: to find Vicki, crouched inside, scared shitless.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Vicki! Are you all right?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yeah. Just a little shaken up.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Well, shake it off, tough lady, we
dialog: got work to do. Let’s skedaddle.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Shouldn’t we check the dead guys
dialog: for clues?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yeah, okay. Yes.
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: INT. RAIL YARD WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: All of the dead men are laid out side by side.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: This cell phone is all we got.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Then we better make the most of it.
dialog: Because at this point, this is our
text: only connection to the passcodes.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY -- DAY
text: The surveillance van drives by.
scene_heading: INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN -- NIGHT
text: MacGruber drives. Vicki sits shotgun. Piper’s in the back.
text: MacGruber lifts up a carrot and takes a bite.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Gross.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I washed it.
text: In the rearview mirror, MacGruber shoots a look at Piper
text: which shows that he doesn’t truly mean it.
dialog: SFX: cell phone ring
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Holy shit! Is that tracer hooked
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: VICKI
text: Set to jet, MacGruber.
text: MacGruber grabs the phone.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I just hope I can keep this guy on
dialog: the phone long enough to get a
text: location on him.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: What are you gonna say?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I'll figure something out.
dialog: (into phone)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER (cont'd)
dialog: Listen to me, you piece of shit.
dialog: Hoss and Zeke are dead and if you
dialog: don’t tell me who this is--he hung
dialog: up. You get it?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Damn it. Is that thing working?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yes. But you have to keep them on
text: for at least twenty seconds.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Sorry, lost my cool. I just want
dialog: this so badly.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Well, next time, just think about
dialog: how badly you want it and then
dialog: Maybe you won’t lose your temper.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You're right. Maybe he’1ll call
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I doubt it.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Shit! I am so fucking stupid!
text: MacGruber’s phone rings.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Haha! Second chance. In your face!
dialog: (he picks up)
dialog: Listen to me, you piece of shit--
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGON -- SAME TIME
text: Faith at his desk. (Intercut with MacGruber)
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: MacGruber, it’s Faith.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Colonel! How’s it going?
dialog: (whispered, to Vicki)
dialog: It’s my phone.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What's the mission status?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Mission status? Uh, fuckin’ great.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So you've got some leads?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yep. Lots. What do you got?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Not much on our end. We know Cunth
text: is having a fundraiser in his home.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yeah, that is a shitty lead.
dialog: That’s next week, right?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No, it’s tonight.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yep, yep, tonight. Casual dress,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No. It’s actually a formal affair.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yep, formal affair, tonight, exact
dialog: same intel we had.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Got any other leads?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: We got some leads that are gonna
dialog: blow your fucking mind.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Great, I’m gonna conference in the
dialog: President.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Oh shit, oh shit. Ate something
dialog: bad. Gotta go. Hoooahhh.
dialog: (hangs up)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER (cont'd)
dialog: That was close. He was gonna put
dialog: the President on, pretty cool huh?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: So Cunth is having a party?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yeah. And guess who just made the
dialog: guest list?
text: Camera moves in dramatically on MacGruber’s intense face.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Guess who just made the guest list?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Us?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: EXT. CUNTH’S MANSION -- NIGHT
dialog: Super: Cunth Mansion, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA
text: Soft rock blares as the Miata door opens. White cowboy boots
text: hit the pavement. Pan up a white tux with country piping to
dialog: see MacGruber.
text: MacGruber gives his keys to a valet, pulls out his stereo and
text: walks to the front door where he’s greeted by a MAN IN A TUX.
speaker_heading: MAN IN A TUX
dialog: Sir, do you have your invitation?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Oh yeah, sure. It’s right...
text: MacGruber searches his pockets, but instead of a ticket,
text: presents to the man his hand, middle finger sticking out.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: ..-here.
text: He then walks on by and into the party.
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S MANSION -- NIGHT
text: MacGruber walks by a COAT CHECK GIRL.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: COAT CHECK GIRL
dialog: Can I take your coat? Your car
dialog: stereo?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Nice try.
dialog: (into wrist mic)
dialog: Piper, I’m in.
scene_heading: INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN -- SAME TIME
text: Piper monitors from the van.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: MacGruber, keep in mind, you wanna
dialog: keep a low profile here.
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S MANSION -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Sorry Piper, low profile isn’t in
dialog: my vocabulary. Pounding Cunth on
dialog: the other hand--
speaker_heading: PIPER (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah, I got it.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Where’s Vicki?
speaker_heading: PIPER (0.S.)
dialog: She arrived ten minutes ago. She’s
text: in the banquet hall.
text: MacGruber sees a closed door and starts for it.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I’ll find her in a sec. First I
dialog: got a little business to attend to.
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S MANSION -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: A quartet plays classical music as MacGruber scans the room,
text: searching for Vicki. The floor is crowded with people in
text: tuxedos and elegant dresses. The crowd parts.
text: Passionate music swells as we pan up Vicki to see some shiny
text: sensible shoes and a moderately-priced, flowy white pantsuit
text: and faux pearls.
text: MacGruber is stunned by her beauty.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Where have you been?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Sorry, just took an upper decker in
text: the master bathroom.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: An upper decker?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: It’s where you take a dump in the
text: water tank and not in the bowl.
dialog: You look great.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Uh... thank you.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Piper, got a location on Cunth?
speaker_heading: PIPER (0.S.)
text: He appears to be in the east wing.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: On my way.
text: He starts away. Vicki grabs his hand and pulls him back.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Don’t do anything stupid.
text: MacGruber smiles at her.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You know me.
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S MANSION -- DRAWING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Cunth is engaged in a high stakes game of poker -- a
text: BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN stands behind him. There is only one
text: other player left in the game, JURGEN KRAUSS, 65.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: I’1l see your twenty thousand and
dialog: raise you forty thousand.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER (0.S.)
text: He’s bluffing.
text: Cunth looks up from his cards to see his old nemesis.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
text: I can tell by the look in his beady
dialog: little eyes.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: MacGruber. I’ve been expecting
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Bet’s to you, Mr. Krauss.
text: Krauss looks at MacGruber and then to his cards and pushes a
text: huge stack of chips into the center.
speaker_heading: MR. KRAUSS
dialog: I’m all in.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Mr. Krauss is all in for two
dialog: hundred fifty thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Call.
text: They flip over their cards.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Straight flush.
speaker_heading: MR. KRAUSS
dialog: Fuck!
text: Mr. Krauss walks off, pissed.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Sorry about that. I really thought
text: he was bluffing.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Thank you, MacGruber. You just
dialog: made me a teeny tiny bit wealthier
dialog: than I already am.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I’m sure you’ll do something useful
dialog: with it. Your companion’s a very
text: beautiful young woman.
dialog: (to woman)
dialog: Hope you like being date raped,
dialog: ma’am.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: This is my daughter.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: Hello. Sorry, he killed my wife.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Honey, could you give us a few
dialog: moments?
text: Cunth’s daughter rolls her eyes and walks away.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Where’s the X5?
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: I don’t know what you’re talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Where is the fucking warhead?
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: What would I want with a nuclear
dialog: warhead?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I never said it was nuclear.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Sorry, you're right. Most warheads
text: are filled with air.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You know, I ran into Zeke Pleshette
dialog: and Hoss Bender the other day.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Really? And how were they?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
text: A lot less dead than they are now.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Hm, that’s too bad.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Too bad for you. Cuz they were
dialog: part of your little dream team of
dialog: thugs, weren’t they?
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Yes, they were -- past tense. Very
dialog: sad story actually.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: I had assembled the greatest team
dialog: of bad guys this world has ever
dialog: seen and I had them all in this
dialog: room and I had forgotten that I had
dialog: some C4 in there and wouldn’t you
dialog: know it, the whole place exploded
dialog: and I lost them all.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You're shitting me. You are
dialog: shitting me. Well, we have a lot
dialog: in common because I...
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Oh no, wait, that didn’t happen to
dialog: me because I’m not a fucking retard
text: who blows up his own dudes.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Fuck you, Cunth! And by the way, I
dialog: have a new team now -- that’s
dialog: right. Not only do I have the best
dialog: timer in the business, but also one
dialog: of the greatest young military
dialog: minds around. I mean, this guy’s
dialog: the real deal.
scene_heading: INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN -- NIGHT
text: Piper smiles. That was nice of MacGruber to say.
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S MANSION -- DRAWING ROOM -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: ...and we are gonna stop you.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: You have a very healthy
dialog: imagination, MacGruber. I
dialog: certainly do not have a warhead,
dialog: nuclear or otherwise.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You're lying. And you’re a piece
dialog: of shit.
text: Cunth rises to leave.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: That’s enough here. Gentlemen,
dialog: please show Mr. MacGruber the door.
text: Three LARGE HENCHMEN surround MacGruber.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Let me tell you how this is gonna
dialog: go down. First I’m gonna kick you
dialog: in the chin, breaking your jaw in
dialog: four places, then I’m gonna take
dialog: you and karate flip you over my
dialog: back and then knee your nose into
dialog: your brain, killing you instantly.
dialog: I do wanna get a throat rip in here
dialog: somehow -- think that’s gonna be
dialog: you, small fry. One disclaimer,
dialog: the order is subject to change
dialog: depending on my whim. But one
dialog: thing I do know -- at the end of
dialog: the day, Cunth, I’m gonna rip your
dialog: dick off and shove it in your mouth
dialog: and that is non-negotiable. So
dialog: who's first?
scene_heading: EXT. CUNTH’S MANSION -- NIGHT
text: MacGruber gets thrown out the window.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Ah shit! My fucking back.
text: Moments later, his car stereo gets thrown out too.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Goddamn it! That’s a Blaupunkt!
dialog: You owe me a Blaupunkt!
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S MANSION -- LATER
text: Cunth, still dressed in party attire, bursts through a set of
text: double doors followed by a henchman.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Dammit! How the hell did he get in
dialog: here?! Want to explain that to me?
speaker_heading: HENCHMAN
text: He walked in the front door, sir.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Well, La Di Da! He walked in the
dialog: front door!
text: Cunth notices the henchman’s finger is bleeding.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: What happened to your finger?
speaker_heading: HENCHMAN
text: He tried to bite my hand off.
text: A drop of blood falls to the floor. Cunth looks at it and
text: then at the henchman.

speaker_heading: FAITH

speaker_heading: FAITH (cont'd)
dialog: Look MacGruber, you’re a true

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: FAITH

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: MacGruber.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: PIPER

speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: If it’s any consolation, I thought
dialog: you made the right call. And being
dialog: with you over the last few days, I
dialog: learned a lot. A lot of it was

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: What? Come on. I mean, don’t get

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Never ever say never ever.

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: That must have been really hard.

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: No, you don’t.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No, I do. I treated you so badly.

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: PIPER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You're wearing a bullet proof vest?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Wait, you didn’t know?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: What, no, of course I did! I knew
dialog: the whole time.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Pull over. Let me out.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Because you just used me as a human

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I did not!
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Yes, you did!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No, I didn’t! Vicki, did I use him

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yeah, you kinda did.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You're blowing this out of

speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: No, I’m not. Pull over.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Fine.
text: MacGruber pulls over, let’s Piper out and peels back onto the

text: slams on the brakes and throws it in reverse.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Did you just kick my car?
text: Piper kicks it again, repeatedly. MacGruber drives off.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

scene_heading: EXT. VICKI’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: (he’s not)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Oh God, what happened to your leg?
text: MacGruber’s leg is covered in blood.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: It’s nothing.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: MacGruber, you've been shot!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I wish it was through the head.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Don’t say that! Come inside. Let

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Okay.
text: MacGruber sadly pulls his battered car stereo out, gets out

scene_heading: INT. VICKI’S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: MacGruber sits on a table, his pants around his ankles.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: This might sting a little.

dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Okay, I’m gonna remove the bullet.
dialog: You wanna bite down on this?
text: She hands him a leather belt. He tosses it aside.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I deserve pain.
text: Vicki reaches into MacGruber’s open leg wound with a pair of
text: bottle-nose pliers and searches for the bullet.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I don’t know what happened back
dialog: there. I just freaked out. That’s
dialog: never happened to me before.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Everybody makes mistakes.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No, not me.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: He didn’t die.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: But he could have.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You're being too hard on yourself.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No. Maybe the Colonel's right.
dialog: Maybe I’ve lost it. Why do you
dialog: stick around?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Because I believe in what you’re
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Yes! You’re an amazing man.
dialog: You're gorgeous, amazing body, good
dialog: sense of style, smart, brave.
dialog: Casey was a very lucky woman to
dialog: have a man like you.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Well, you’re a very special woman
dialog: too. Tell me, why didn’t you ever
dialog: get married?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: There’s only one man I’ve ever
dialog: loved and he’s taken.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: He’s married?
speaker_heading: VICKI
text: He was. But she’s still in his
dialog: heart, God rest her soul.
text: MacGruber suddenly realizes Vicki's talking about him.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Maybe one day, you’ll get the
dialog: courage to tell him how you feel.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Maybe...
dialog: (back to reality)
dialog: Got it.
text: Vicki drops the bloody bullet onto a tray, then notices
text: something and then averts her eyes.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: MacGruber?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Sorry, I always get an erection
text: when a beautiful woman uses a pair
dialog: of pliers near my balls.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: MacGruber...

dialog: ...thank you.

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Leave it open...

text: MacGruber looks her right in the eyes.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I like holes.

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (nervous )
dialog: I’m a virgin.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Not for long.
text: They kiss hard. They remove each other’s clothing.

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: VICKI

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: CASEY (0.S.)

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Then don’t say anything.
text: Casey kisses MacGruber hard. MacGruber kisses back. They

text: MacGruber playing sexy saxophone on top of a crypt.
text: Angle on: CEMETERY GROUNDSKEEPER hauling trash bags. His
text: eyes widen.
text: Groundskeeper’s POV: A naked MacGruber having hardcore sex

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Good news?
speaker_heading: FAITH

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I want to be there when you take

speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: MacGruber, you ready for this? We

text: the possession of a Jurgen Krauss.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Jim, listen. You're wrong. It’s
dialog: Cunth. I’d stake my life on it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Don’t let your history with Cunth
dialog: cloud your vision, Mac. He’s not
dialog: involved. Look, the President's
dialog: thrilled. If all goes smoothly, he
dialog: might mention it during the State
dialog: of the Union Address tonight.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: The State of the Union. Jim! Call
dialog: the White House! Evacuate
dialog: Washington DC! Cunth is going to
dialog: nuke the State of the Union!
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: MacGruber--
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I know it, Jim. I don’t know why
dialog: he’s gonna do it, but that’s his
dialog: play. I can feel it in my bones!
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So you want me to ignore very
dialog: credible intelligence and evacuate
dialog: Washington DC because you have a
dialog: hunch?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No. If I were you, I'd evacuate
text: the entire eastern seaboard.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (humoring)
dialog: Okay, I’1ll get right on it. Look
dialog: Grubes, if it’s any comfort, we
dialog: couldn't have done it without you.
dialog: Well, actually I guess we could
dialog: have since none of the information
dialog: came from your leads. Mac, I’m
dialog: joking. Really, thank you. The
dialog: American people owe you a huge debt
dialog: of gratitude.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
text: More like a huge debt of splatitude
text: when all of their bodies explode.
dialog: Jim, you’re being duped.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: MacGruber, take some time off. Go
dialog: to the beach. Kick your heals up

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: PIPER

scene_heading: EXT. CUNTH’S COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: Binoc POV: the grounds are crawling with armed guards.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Eleven... twelve that I can see,
dialog: but there will be more inside.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Hope they got a ditch dug out back
dialog: for all the bodies. Otherwise
dialog: things are gonna get real smelly
dialog: here later on.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: That’s a pretty gross way to look
text: at it.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Well, I’m a realist. I don’t know
dialog: how many people you’re planning on
dialog: killing, but I am definitely--
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Shhhh!
text: A GUARD approaches, making his rounds. He smokes a cigarette.
speaker_heading: PIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: Just let him pass. We don’t want
dialog: to attract attention -- MacGruber?
dialog: 77.
text: Piper looks around, MacGruber is gone. All of a sudden
text: MacGruber appears behind the guard and TEARS OUT HIS THROAT.
text: The guard falls to the ground, dead.
speaker_heading: PIPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus Christ!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Pretty cool, right? Bet you
dialog: weren’t expecting that.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Yeah, it was really disgusting.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: That guy would’ve done the exact
dialog: same thing to me if he had the
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: He would have ripped your throat
dialog: out with his bare--
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Down! Now!
text: MacGruber pushes Piper to the ground as a SPOTLIGHT hits
text: their position. A tense beat. The spotlight moves on.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER (CONT’D)
dialog: That was too close. We need a new
dialog: point of entry.
text: MacGruber spots a large SEWER PIPE leading into the compound.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Bingo.
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S COMPOUND - HOLDING CELL - NIGHT
text: Vicki, bound to a metal chair and gagged with a bandana,
text: struggles to free herself. The big metal door swings open

speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Hello, my darling.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Mmmfhhhh, mmmpphh!
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Sorry, I didn’t quite get that.
dialog: 78.
text: Cunth unties the bandana.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Stick it wear the sun don’t shine,
dialog: Dieter!
text: Cunth gets in Vicki’s face, menacing.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: And where would that be, exactly?
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Um... the butt? Up your butthole?
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: So sad. Such a pretty face for
text: such a dirty, dirty mouth.
text: Cunth brushes a loose hair out of Vicki’s face tenderly, then
text: puts her gag in again. As he does, he whispers into her ear.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: I know MacGruber’s coming for you.
dialog: I want to watch him watch me kill
dialog: you in front of him and then I want
dialog: to watch me kill him in front of a
dialog: mirror. Enjoy your stay and please
dialog: let me know if there’s any way for
dialog: me to make it less enjoyable.
text: Cunth laughs as he closes the door. Vicki’s eyes dart around
text: the room for a way out.
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S COMPOUND -- BASEMENT -- NIGHT
text: MacGruber and Piper step out of the other end of the pipe.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: ...and then we rammed.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: You what?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I humped her. I don’t want to use
dialog: the f-word because I don’t want to
dialog: diminish it’s beauty in any way.
dialog: But it was great. I’ve never felt
dialog: that way about a bone session
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Yeah, sounds really special.
dialog: 79.
text: They approach a metal LADDER leading up.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Okay, this looks like the main
dialog: duct. We should be right under the
dialog: guard tower. Ready?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Time to go pound some Cunth.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No, what?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: It's just, I’ve noticed you say
dialog: that line all the time.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: It’s a good line.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: The man’s last name is Cunth!
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: You know, you don’t need to say
dialog: anything. You can just do what
dialog: you’re gonna do without prefacing
text: it with a quote.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You have your way. I have mine.
dialog: Now let’s go pound some Cunth.
text: Piper shakes his head and they start to climb up.

speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Miller, do you copy? Miller? Are
dialog: you there? Damn it, Miller.
text: Suddenly, a box of THROAT LOZENGES is thrown in front of him.
text: He picks it up, confused.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Throat lozenges?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: You’re gonna wanna take the whole
dialog: box.
text: The guard whips around to come face to face with MacGruber
text: who rips out his throat, killing him.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Awesome. Got another throat rip
dialog: in. Might go for the turkey.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: The turkey?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: It’s a bowling term for when you
text: get three strikes in a row.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: That’s sick.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Maybe. But if ripping throats gets
dialog: that warhead back, I’1l rip as many
dialog: throats as I have to.
dialog: (then)
dialog: All right, let’s go over the plan
dialog: one more time.
text: MacGruber unknowingly steps on a FOOT PEDAL on the floor.

dialog: «+. we go after that piece of shit

text: deck. Piper and MacGruber duck.
speaker_heading: PIPER

speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Fucking idiots. Kill them.
speaker_heading: CONSTANTINE
dialog: Sir, we have men going up there.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: CONSTANTINE
dialog: Yes sir.

scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S COMPOUND -- OBSERVATION DECK -- NIGHT
text: The four guards approach the door.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER (0.S.)
dialog: ...I beg you to let us go...

text: CU: Piper’s cell phone is leaned up against the microphone
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER (0.S.)

speaker_heading: LEAD GUARD

speaker_heading: CUNTH

text: Piper and MacGruber enter as MacGruber closes his phone.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Pretty great idea, huh?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: It was my idea.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: But it was my phone.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: We used both of our phones.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Fine, I'll give you partial credit.
dialog: Point is, that oughta buy us some--

speaker_heading: CUNTH
text: Fucking cockroaches.
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S COMPOUND -- HOLDING CELL -- NIGHT
text: Vicki has freed herself from the chair, but her hands are
text: still tied behind her back. She lies on the floor, swings
text: her legs over her head and gnaws at the rope on her wrists.
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S COMPOUND -- MACHINE ROOM -- NIGHT
text: MacGruber and Piper hunker down as they’re shot at. Piper
text: has an AK-47 in one hand and an Uzi in the other. MacGruber
text: is holding twine and a bottle cap.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Okay, I rounded up some twine and
dialog: already had this bottle cap. But
dialog: be on the lookout for a battery or
text: some chewing gum.
text: Piper stands up and returns fire.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Oh another thing that would be
dialog: great would be a bar of soap... or
dialog: some white wine vinegar. Oh, or
dialog: like a common kitty litter. Or...
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: MacGruber, shut the fuck up!
text: Piper returns fire.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I am trying to help here.
speaker_heading: PIPER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I told you, I do not use guns!
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Well you better start because
dialog: sticking a fucking carrot in your
dialog: ass isn’t gonna hack it this time.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I’m not gonna use a gun!
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Because I don’t know how! Okay?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: (beat, amazed)
dialog: You got to be fucking kidding me.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I’ve never used a gun! They scare
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Do you want to save Vicki?
text: Piper holds out the guns. MacGruber thinks about it -- a
text: look of determination comes over his face. He grabs them.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Okay, so what do I do?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: You point it and you shoot it!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Okay, okay. Here goes!
text: MacGruber holds up the gun, averts his eyes and fires wildly.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Oo, I got a window!
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Aim for a person!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Good call, good call.
text: A guy runs across the room. Both MacGruber and Piper shoot

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

dialog: that?
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: I think I actually got him, but

dialog: gonna take these guys out.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No, I wanna do it, I wanna do it!
text: TWO ARMED MEN approach. MacGruber shoots -- both go down.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: This is so awesome! This is so
dialog: much better than those stupid
dialog: fucking gadgets I used to make!
text: MacGruber stands fearlessly and shoots willy nilly at
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
text: A GUY in the distance goes down. MacGruber dives back down.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Got another guy! Can I keep these?
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Look, we’re sitting ducks in here,
dialog: so here’s what we do. On three, we
dialog: make a run for that door. And
dialog: whatever you do, keep shooting!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Deal.
speaker_heading: PIPER/MACGRUBER
dialog: One... two... three!
text: Piper and MacGruber shoot like crazy as they race for the
text: door. Piper looks like a badass, MacGruber does not. They
text: bust through the door to find themselves in a:
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S COMPOUND -- BOILER ROOM - NIGHT
text: Filled with pipes and steam. A GUARD appears and raises his
text: gun to shoot. MacGruber lunges for Piper in slo-mo.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Nooocococo000!
text: MacGruber lands in front of Piper and shields him heroically.
text: The GUARD attempts to fire but his gun is jammed.
dialog: 88.
text: MacGruber punches the guard a few times -- the guard falls to
text: the ground, momentarily stunned.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I was gonna go for a throat rip,
dialog: but I know you’re not into them.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Hey... go for the turkey.
text: Piper smiles at him -- it’s a smile of warmth and respect --
text: a real bond has formed between the two of them.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Really?... Thank you.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: No, thank you for thinking you were
dialog: saving my life.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Hey, I owed you one.
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: Put ‘er there.
text: As they lock hands, the guard gets up and charges them.
speaker_heading: CHARGING GUARD
dialog: Aaaaaaah!
text: MacGruber twirls Piper around like a fancy dance move,
text: clutching him against his chest. Together, MacGruber and
text: Piper rip out the guard’s throat. He falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Aaaa! Gobble gobble gobble gobble!
text: Piper shakes his head and smiles. They make their way to:
scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S COMPOUND -- HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: MacGruber and Piper run around a corner. At the end of the
text: hall is a large metal door.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: This is it. Vicki’s behind that
dialog: door. I know it.
text: They open the door to reveal Vicki is a tangled mess lying on
text: the floor. Her body is impossibly contorted. And somehow
text: the chair is lying on top of her.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER/PIPER
dialog: Vicki!
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Hi!
speaker_heading: SFX: Click
text: Constantine holds a gun to MacGruber’s head.

scene_heading: INT. CUNTH’S COMPOUND -- X5 LAUNCH SITE -- NIGHT

text: Cunth hits the mute.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Oh MacGruber, you're just in time.
dialog: You want a potsticker or a Molson
dialog: or something? We made a pretty
dialog: substantial Costco run. Might be
dialog: tough to get food for a while, so
dialog: we got enough to last for like an
dialog: entire nuclear winter.
dialog: (re: Vicki & Piper)
dialog: Constantine, be a lamb and watch
dialog: these two. I want to play with
text: MacGruber for a while.
text: Constantine holds his gun on Vicki and Piper. The Culebra
text: twins hold MacGruber by his arms.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: So MacGruber, first off let me
dialog: thank you for that upper decker you
dialog: left me.
text: Cunth punches MacGruber’s stomach.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Oof. I can’t wait to kill you.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Oh no! Help me Mommy! Is
dialog: MacGruber gonna rip my throat out?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No, I want your throat to stay
dialog: right where it is, so I can hear
dialog: you scream bloody murder when I rip
dialog: your dick off and shove it in your
dialog: fucking mouth. Tonight!
text: MacGruber tries spit in Cunth’s face but it just dribbles
text: down his chin.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: (not impressed)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Come on, Cunth, you’re better than
dialog: this. It’s not too late to join
dialog: the right team.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: I am the right team. The America
dialog: you represent has been usurped by
dialog: years of lies, corruption and moral
text: turpitude. It’s a broken system
dialog: that can’t be fixed. So it’s got
dialog: to be replaced. That’s where I
dialog: come in.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Sounds like you got it all figured
dialog: out... except for one thing.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: And what’s that?
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Millions of innocent people will
dialog: die.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: There will be some collateral
dialog: damage. But it’s all for the
dialog: greater good. Well, I’m blathering
dialog: on and on. Shall we get to your
dialog: deaths? Oh, but before we do,
dialog: there’s something I’ve been wanting
dialog: to do for a long time.
dialog: gl.
text: Cunth pulls out scissors from his pocket.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Anybody up for a little trim?
text: He starts to approach MacGruber. MacGruber struggles but the
dialog: Culebra twins are way too strong.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No. No! What are you doing?
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: I just want you to look good in
dialog: your coffin.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Don’t fucking do it, Cunth!
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Boys?
text: The Culebras force MacGruber to his knees. Cunth pushes his
text: head down, grabs the back of his mullet, and in one snip,
dialog: cuts it all off.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER/VICKI
dialog: Noooooo!
text: Cunth holds up the hair against the back of his own neck.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: (girly voice)
dialog: Oo, I’m MacGruber. Fuck you, you
dialog: piece of shit. I’m gonna go pound
dialog: some Cunth. You wanna go?!
text: Cunth, Constantine and the Culebra twins laugh heartily.
text: MacGruber raises his head up very slowly. He is filled with
text: a Hulk-level rage.
text: CU: his angry eyes
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
text: With superhuman strength, he breaks free of the Culebra
text: twins’ grasp and in one smooth motion, rips their throats
text: out. Constantine raises his gun.
speaker_heading: PIPER (0.C.)
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 92.
text: Constantine turns to see Piper, who now has his pants around
text: his ankles and a carrot up his butt. Piper does a silly
text: dance and makes noises.
speaker_heading: CONSTANTINE
dialog: What the fuck?
text: Vicki roundhouse kicks Constantine’s face, knocking him out
text: cold. Piper winks at MacGruber. MacGruber smiles back,
dialog: proud. It’s a wonderful moment.
text: MacGruber spin-kicks the gun out of Cunth’s hand. They both
text: race for the gun but MacGruber gets to it first. Cunth
text: appears nervous for the first time.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: I thought you didn’t use guns.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: I don’t.
text: He shoots at Cunth’s hand. Direct hit.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Ah! Son of a bitch!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: What's the deactivation code?
speaker_heading: CUNTH
scene_heading: It’s 1-4-2-F-U-C-K-Y-O-U-
text: MacGruber shoots his other hand. Cunth hunches over in pain.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: God damn it!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: What’s the fucking code?
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: What’s the fucking code?
text: Somehow through the pain, Cunth starts to laugh. MacGruber
text: shoots him in both of his feet.
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: Motherfuck! Just kill me and get
text: it over with.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: No, I want you to live. Because
dialog: after I disarm that nuke, I am
dialog: gonna come back in here and cut
dialog: your dick off and...
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: ...let me guess, shove it in my
dialog: mouth? You’re like a broken
dialog: record.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: The only record I’m gonna break is
dialog: the amount of your own dick in your
dialog: mouth record.
text: MacGruber handcuffs Cunth to a railing on the wall. An alarm
text: sounds, warning lights flash.
speaker_heading: FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: VICKI

text: Vicki hands him the ball bearing.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Piper, those pliers!
speaker_heading: PIPER
dialog: On the way, Grubes!
text: Piper hands him pliers. MacGruber turns around and starts
dialog: working on something.
speaker_heading: VICKI/PIPER
dialog: Hurry up, MacGruber!/We’re running
dialog: out of time!
text: MacGruber turns back around, gets down on one knee and
text: presents to Vicki a hastily assembled copper wire ring with a
text: ball bearing diamond.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Vicki, make me the happiest...
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (frantically)
dialog: Yes yes, great, yeah, sure!
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Yes! I porked Casey’s ghost last
dialog: night, we can talk about that
dialog: later. All right, we've got a
dialog: nuclear warhead to...
text: MacGruber pries open the console of the bomb.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Holy shit.
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: What’s wrong, MacGruber?
text: MacGruber pulls out a million tiny wires from the console.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: Right again, Cunth. Of course...
text: MacGruber starts fidgeting again inside the X5.

dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: So yeah, I wasn’t able to disable

speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: Now is there anyone here with just

text: Cunth drops the rocket launcher and charges at MacGruber.
text: MacGruber quickly overpowers him and punches and kicks him
text: until he’s right at the edge of the cliff.
text: MacGruber kicks Cunth in the stomach repeatedly. Cunth moans

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: What’s so funny?
speaker_heading: CUNTH
dialog: I was just thinking about your last

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER

speaker_heading: MACGRUBER
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: Suck your own dick.
text: MacGruber cuts Cunth’s dick off and shoves it in his mouth.
