scene_heading: MR. SWIFT (FAT AND REPELLENT) STEPS AWAY FROM A GIANT MAP

speaker_heading: MR. SWIFT

speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH

speaker_heading: MR. SWIFT
dialog: You -- you -- what!?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Which means that map you've almost

speaker_heading: RAGETTI

speaker_heading: PINTEL
dialog: It seems one of their ships went

speaker_heading: BARBOSSA

scene_heading: THEY BOTH STOP -- CLEARLY NERVOUS --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
text: The red door. Doesn’t look so bad,
dialog: Scrum. You go first.
speaker_heading: SCRUM
dialog: Jack, I don’t keep company with

dialog: and boils. Makes me miss my Mum.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Your mother was a witch?
speaker_heading: SCRUM
dialog: Just incredibly ugly.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Nothing to be afraid of, Scrum.
dialog: Except that two-headed dog.
dialog: 20.
text: A TWO-HEADED DOG IS GROWLING AT THEM BY THE RED DOOR --
speaker_heading: SCRUM

scene_heading: AND JACK AND SCRUM STARE IN AT MELIA -- A YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL

scene_heading: SCRUM AND JACK STARE IN AT MELIA -- A VISION OF FEMALE

scene_heading: BOILING WATER -- WHICH IMMEDIATELY FLAMES UP --
speaker_heading: SCRUM
dialog: On second thought -- I’1l pass on the
dialog: tea.
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: Each time I cast a spell it cost me a
dialog: piece of myself. This is the price I
dialog: pay for stepping to the other side.
dialog: The question is -- what price will you
dialog: pay to be Captain of the Pearl again?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Name it and I shall pay it.
dialog: 21.
text: MELIA STEPS CLOSER -- TAKES THE KNIFE AND CUTS JACK’S FINGER.
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: Your blood. This is the price you
dialog: agreed to pay when you came through my

text: SHE GETS CLOSE TO JACK NOW -- TASTES THE BLOOD ON HIS FINGER.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Might explain why you’re not very
dialog: busy.
text: SHE LOOKS AT THE PEARL -- THE SHIP FLOATING INSIDE THE
speaker_heading: BOTTLE.
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: My powers are not strong enough.
dialog: You’re the one who will free the
dialog: Pearl.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: It will be free when you find the
text: Trident of Poseidon.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Hard to find something when you’re not
dialog: looking for it.
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: But you are -- you just don’t know it
dialog: yet. You will find The Map No Man Can
dialog: Read -- which will lead you inside the
dialog: Devil’s Triangle. This is where the
text: Trident lies.
speaker_heading: SCRUM
dialog: Jack -- did she say Devil’s --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Time to go!
text: JACK AND SCRUM QUICKLY RUSHING TO LEAVE -- BUT THE DOOR SLAMS
text: SHUT IN FRONT OF THEM.
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: You are wise to fear the Triangle.
dialog: Captain Brand remains where you left
dialog: him. Waiting 16 years to take the
dialog: life that took his own.
text: JACK TURNS TO HER NOW -- MORE THAN A BIT CONCERNED.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Has it been 16 years? I’11 bet he’s
dialog: forgotten all about me --
scene_heading: MELIA’S POT BOILING OVER NOW -- AND IN THE SEETHING WATER
text: THEY SUDDENLY SEE WHAT SHE SEES -- TWO SMALL SHIPS FIGHTING
text: INSIDE THE POT -- A BATTLE TAKING PLACE.
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: This is a battle from your past. You
dialog: sank his ship -- left him to sink
dialog: beneath the gates of hell --
text: imprisoned in the triangle. And like
dialog: all who die there, his spirit will not
text: rest until he has his revenge.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: He'll have to wait a bit longer -- as
dialog: I have no plans to visit.
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: You have no choice. If you want to
dialog: live.
text: IN HER POT WE SUDDENLY SEE THE EYE -- THE YELLOW EYE STARING
text: BACK AT THEM.
speaker_heading: MELIA (CONT'D)
text: The dead Captain holds The Eye of
dialog: Poseidon -- the key to finding the
dialog: Trident. And with the Trident -- he
dialog: will finally be free.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Free? Metaphorically?
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: Free to take his revenge on you. Your
dialog: only hope is to find the Trident
text: before he does.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: So let me get this straight. You're
dialog: saying the only way for me to live, is
dialog: to sail into the one place on earth I
dialog: am sure to die?
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: The Devil’s Triangle is your destiny.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Sorry -- don’t believe in destiny.
dialog: Gets in the way of opportunity.
speaker_heading: SHE WALKS
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: There is no escaping it. Tonight you
dialog: will be married, have two children,
dialog: and kill 46 men in cold blood.
speaker_heading: SCRUM
text: Going to be a busy night.
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: You came here to save a ship, to save

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: And if I refuse to chase the ghosts of
dialog: my past?
scene_heading: OVER -- DRAWS JACK’S SWORD FROM HIS BELT.
speaker_heading: MELIA
dialog: Then Brand will use this sword to cut
dialog: your throat.
text: THE DOOR OPENS BEHIND THEM NOW.
speaker_heading: MELIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Your destiny is sealed, Jack Sparrow.
dialog: Find the Trident or die.
scene_heading: EXT. —- PORT ROYAL. - NIGHT
scene_heading: JACK AND SCRUM RUSH OUT OF MELIA’S SHACK -- BOTH A BIT
text: RATTLED AS THEY LOOK UP AT THE MOON.
speaker_heading: SCRUM
dialog: We never should have gone there, Jack.
dialog: We have to find The Map No Man Can
dialog: Read, which you're already looking for
dialog: -- but just don’t know it.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: If I can’t read it, then why would I
dialog: look for it?
speaker_heading: SCRUM
dialog: But that naked witch says your throat
dialog: will be cut by your own sword. Did I
dialog: mention she was naked?
text: JACK DRAWS HIS SWORD -- CASUALLY TOSSES IT INTO THE OCEAN.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Problem solved.
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: INT. - KING GEORGE PUB. - PORT ROYAL. - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: BRITISH SOLDIERS ARE SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE INSIDE THE PUB --

speaker_heading: KING GEORGE --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: You see, Scrum. My only destiny is a
text: bottle of rum and a warm bed upstairs.
dialog: That witch was a charlatan, a two bit
dialog: four-flusher...
speaker_heading: SCRUM
dialog: Jack -- is that your sword?
text: A FISHERMAN HAS CUT OPEN HIS NET AND DROPPED HIS CATCH ON THE
scene_heading: BAR -- FISH FLOPPING EVERYWHERE. IN THE PILE OF FISH WE SEE
text: THAT JACK’S SWORD HAS DROPPED ONTO THE BAR.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
text: No. Must be a fish. A swordfish.
text: THE LARGEST OF THE FISH FLIPS ITS TAIL AND KNOCKS THE SWORD
text: ONTO THE FLOOR -- WHERE IT’S QUICKLY KICKED ACROSS THE DIRT
scene_heading: BY A DRUNK -- THEN KICKED BY A COUPLE DANCING -- THE SWORD
text: EVENTUALLY LANDING RIGHT AT JACK’'S FEET.
scene_heading: JACK SLOWLY BENDS DOWN TO PICK IT UP -- SCRUM HORRIFIED --—
speaker_heading: SCRUM
text: That appears to be a double-edged bone
text: and steel cutlass with a slight nick
text: at the tip.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: No. There is no destiny!
text: JACK QUICKLY OPENS A BARREL OF RUM -- DROPS THE SWORD INSIDE
text: AND THEN HEADS FOR THE DOOR --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
dialog: We'll try a different pub!
text: AS HE TURNS TO LEAVE JACK WALKS STRAIGHT INTO A GUN -- THE
text: WEAPON AIMED AT HIS HEAD.
speaker_heading: PIG KELLY
dialog: Well, if it isn’t the pirate who stole
dialog: my ship!
text: Jack looks at PIERRE “PIG” KELLY AND HIS FOUR LARGE MEN --
text: ALL HOLDING WEAPONS.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Pig -- I’ve been looking for you.
dialog: Wanted to give you this gold coin as
dialog: compensation for borrowing the Gull.
dialog: 25.
text: JACK HOLDS UP THE GOLD COIN -- WHICH PIG TAKES.
speaker_heading: PIG KELLY
dialog: You've been sailing on my ship.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: You have three. And this one’s not
text: much of a ship. One gun, leaks in the
text: hull, rats everywhere.
speaker_heading: SCRUM
dialog: Which are delicious by the way.
speaker_heading: PIG KELLY
dialog: You’1ll settle your debt here and now.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Of course, Pig. Name your price.
speaker_heading: PIG KELLY
dialog: Her name is Beatrice. And she’s my
dialog: daughter.
text: BEATRICE WALKS UP TO THEM NOW -- STARES AT JACK.
speaker_heading: PIG KELLY (CONT’D)
dialog: She's a midwife -- no respectable man
dialog: will have her. You'll do just fine.

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I‘1l do what?
speaker_heading: PIG KELLY
dialog: Marry her. Take her off my hands
dialog: forever. To clear your debt.

speaker_heading: TEETH.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: As a Captain I will officiate the

speaker_heading: PIG KELLY
dialog: Say “I do” or die.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I’m trying. Having a bit of a midwife
dialog: crisis.
scene_heading: SUDDENLY TWO HORRIBLE CHILDREN COME RUSHING UP TO JACK --
speaker_heading: KIDS

speaker_heading: SCRUM

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW

speaker_heading: BRITISH SOLDIER

speaker_heading: BARBOSSA

speaker_heading: BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve come to hear the tale.
speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX
dialog: Nobody believes in ghost stories.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA

speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX
dialog: There was a diamond on a French ship --

speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
text: A diamond in the shape of an eye?
dialog: Some say it be the key to unlocking

speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX

speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX (CONT’D)
dialog: Will you take me back there, Sir?
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: You wish to return?
speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX
dialog: I left someone alive. Her name is

dialog: I will do.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Sorry, boy. I don’t sail with
dialog: Redcoats.
scene_heading: BARBOSSA TURNS TO LEAVE -—
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX
dialog: The Eye will be his forever. There is
dialog: no one to challenge a murderous ghost
text: with a taste for blood.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Blood is common currency. Maybe he
dialog: desires something far more valuable.
speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX
dialog: What would that be?
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: The one thing all dead men seek.
dialog: Revenge.
scene_heading: INT. - BRITISH PRISON. - PORT ROYAL. - DAY

scene_heading: BEATEN BY ADMIRAL SCARFIELD --
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL SCARFIELD

dialog: kill my men without paying a heavy
dialog: debt.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: How about I marry your daughter?
text: AND NOW SCARFIELD HITS HIM HARD ACROSS THE JAW --
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
text: A pirate is responsible for butchering
dialog: those men. Which means a pirate shall
dialog: die for it.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Have you considered the work of
dialog: William Kidd? I hear his ship has
text: over 100 guns -- seems to be having a
dialog: very good year.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
dialog: William Kidd does not sail in these
dialog: waters. But you do --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: What about Red Beard? He’s very tough
dialog: -- and that beard -- it’s very red.
dialog: You'd get a nice crowd to see him die.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
dialog: You pirates think you can challenge
dialog: us? We’re the British Navy -- and we
dialog: control the seas.
dialog: 29.
text: JACK LOOKS UP AT HIM NOW --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: No one can control her. The ocean is
dialog: as free as a pirate -- always will be.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
dialog: But you’re not free. You’re guilty of
dialog: murder and will face a public
dialog: execution. How would you like to die?
text: Hanging, firing squad, or a new
dialog: invention -- the guillotine.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Guillotine. Sounds French. I love

scene_heading: INT. - PRISON CELLS. - DAY

speaker_heading: TEAGUE

speaker_heading: TEAGUE

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Excellent tip. What do you know of
dialog: the Eye of Poseidon?
speaker_heading: TEAGUE
dialog: Witches found it. That’s why they’ve
dialog: arrested them all -- they want the
dialog: diamond back.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: If they’re searching for The Eye --
dialog: they're going after the Trident as
dialog: well.
scene_heading: THE BRITISH GRAB JACK -- TRY TO PULL HIM AWAY.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: TEAGUE
dialog: Every nation at war is searching for

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: The Tomb of Posedion?
speaker_heading: TEAGUE

speaker_heading: PIRATE #1
dialog: Doesn’t make no sense, Scrum. Why

dialog: any of us?
speaker_heading: PIRATE #2
dialog: Maybe he’s ashamed of us.
speaker_heading: SCRUM
dialog: You're not following --
speaker_heading: PIRATE #1
dialog: And why would he kill 46 men in cold
dialog: blood?
speaker_heading: PIRATE #2
dialog: On his wedding day no less.
speaker_heading: SCRUM
dialog: The point is -- Jack’s been arrested.
speaker_heading: PIRATE #1
dialog: Since we did not attend the wedding --

dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: GIBBS
text: He’s about to be killed straight away!
dialog: We have to do something.
speaker_heading: PIRATE #3
dialog: And why would we do that? Seems to me
dialog: he’s lied to us, fleeced and swindled
dialog: us at every turn.
speaker_heading: PIRATE #2
dialog: And when we was going straight.
speaker_heading: GIBBS
dialog: Are you forgetting the diamonds!
dialog: Knowing Jack he’s probably got his
dialog: hands on that treasure right now!
speaker_heading: PIRATE #2
dialog: There is no treasure. Just another
dialog: lie from Captain Sparrow.
speaker_heading: GIBBS
dialog: Aye. But a lie from Jack Sparrow
dialog: always leads to another lie -- a
dialog: bigger lie -- a lie that on occasion
dialog: leads to a grain of truth.
scene_heading: THE MEN LOOK AT GIBBS NOW --
speaker_heading: GIBBS (CONT'D)

text: SURROUND HER.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: So what's these markings on the wall
dialog: then?
speaker_heading: WITCH #2
dialog: Casting spells no doubt. She’s going

speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: I’m no witch.
dialog: 32.
text: THEY ALL LAUGH AT HER -——
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Tell us then -- what is it you’re
dialog: scribbling there? What are all those
dialog: numbers?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
text: It’s an equation from Galileo’s diary.
dialog: I believe it’s part of a map.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: What kind of map?
text: CARINA TURNS TO HIM -- LOOKS ACROSS AT HIM WITH PIERCING BLUE
speaker_heading: EYES.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: You wouldn’t understand. It’s a Map --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: -- No Man Can Read.
text: AND NOW CARINA WALKS TO THE BARS --— AND JACK GETS TO HIS FEET
text: -- KNOWS HIS DESTINY IS STANDING DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM HIM --
scene_heading: THAT SHE ALONE CAN LEAD HIM WHERE HE NEEDS TO GO. MTHERE’S
text: JUST ONE SMALL PROBLEM.
speaker_heading: BRITISH SOLDIER
dialog: Open the cells. It’s time to die.
scene_heading: EXT. - PUBLIC EXECUTION SQUARE. - PORT ROYAL. - DAY
text: THE TOWN SQUARE IS FILLED WITH PRISONERS WAITING TO BE
text: KILLED. A CROWD OF LOCALS IS CHEERING, SCREAMING, ENJOYING
text: THE SPECTACLE OF PUBLIC EXECUTIONS.
text: CLOSE ON A TERRIFIED PIRATE LOCKED INSIDE THE GUILLOTINE,
text: PRAYING TO HIMSELF. THE EXECUTIONER PULLS THE SWITCH, AND
text: THE BLADE COMES DOWN HARD -- THE MAN’S HEAD ROLLING INTO A
text: BASKET. JACK STANDS NEXT TO THE GUILLOTINE WATCHING THIS
text: WITH A LOOK OF SHEER REPULSION ON HIS FACE.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: So that’s a guillotine?
scene_heading: THEY DRAG JACK UP TO THE GUILLOTINE -- OPEN THE LOCKS --—
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW (CONT'D)
dialog: I've changed my mind. Like to go with
dialog: firing squad. Is there someone I
dialog: could talk to...
speaker_heading: BRITISH SOLDIER
dialog: Silence!
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: The French are obviously sick people.
dialog: How about a good old-fashioned stoning
dialog: -- gets the crowd involved.
text: THEY SHOVE JACK INTO THE GUILLOTINE AND TRY TO LOCK HIM IN.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
dialog: There’s quite a bit of blood on there.
dialog: And a good portion of neck.
text: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE CARINA SMYTH IS STANDING ON
text: THE GALLOWS PLATFORM -- A NOOSE AROUND HER NECK.
speaker_heading: SHE TAKES
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: These will be the last words of Carina
dialog: Smyth.
text: OUT A PIECE OF PAPER AND BEGINS TO READ.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
dialog: Good Sirs -- I am not a witch and have
dialog: never practiced witchcraft. But I
dialog: forgive your common dim-wittedness and
dialog: feeble brains incapable of educated
dialog: thought. In short, most of you have
dialog: the mind of a goat --
text: Jack yells out from the guillotine.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: If I could request a word. Is it not
dialog: common practice for those being
dialog: executed to be offered a last meal?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Sir, I believe I was making a point.
dialog: If you could just be patient.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
text: My head is about to be lopped off --
dialog: hence the urgency.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: And my neck is to be broken.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
text: On occasion the neck doesn’t break.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I’ve seen men swing for hours -- the
text: life slowly choking out of them. Eyes
text: bulging, tongue swelling -- not
dialog: pretty.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: May I finish!
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: The point is -- it’s entirely possible
dialog: you still have hours left to whisper
dialog: your last words, whereas my head will
text: soon be in this basket staring up at
dialog: my lifeless body -- which happens to
dialog: be famished!
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Go ahead and kill him. I’11 wait.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I wouldn’t hear of it. Witches first.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH

speaker_heading: PIG KELLY
dialog: How do you figure?
text: A GUN IS NOW PLACED AT KELLY’S HEAD. THE WEAPON COCKED --
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: Step away from me husband.
scene_heading: BEATRICE HAS HER OWN GUN OUT -- AIMS IT AT HER FATHER. SHE

dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: PIG KELLY
text: This loathsome pirate is trying to

speaker_heading: BEATRICE

text: JACK TAKES THE GUN FROM KELLY’S HAND AS SEVERAL PIRATES GRAB
scene_heading: HIM FROM BEHIND.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Thank you, darling. But I really must

scene_heading: JACK AT THE WHEEL -—
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)

scene_heading: SCRUM MOTIONS TO CARINA -- STILL UNCONSCIOUS ON THE DECK --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: She will lead me to the Trident.
speaker_heading: SCRUM
text: But a woman on board brings nothing
dialog: but bad luck. And rabies.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
text: Frivolous superstition, Mr. Scrum. As
dialog: you can see, luck is steadfast on my
dialog: side.
dialog: 38.
text: ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS APPROACHES JACK WITH A SWORD.
speaker_heading: PIRATE #1
dialog: Good news, Captain. I found this in

dialog: empty barrel of rum --
text: THE CREW MEMBER HOLDS UP THE SWORD -- HANDS IT TO JACK.
speaker_heading: PIRATE #1 (CONT’D)
dialog: I believe it’s yours. A double-edged

text: JACK LOOKS TERRIFIED AS HE SLOWLY REACHES OUT TO GRAB HIS OWN
scene_heading: SWORD -- GLANCES AT A TERRIFIED SCRUM --
speaker_heading: SCRUM

scene_heading: INT. - BARBOSSA’S SHIP. - DAY
text: Barbossa is at the wheel of THE QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE --
text: eyeing the sea as he holds BLACKBEARD’S SWORD. PINTEL AND
scene_heading: RAGETTI APPROACH HIM -- BOTH A BIT HESITANT.
speaker_heading: PINTEL
dialog: Sir, not that it’s our place to ask
dialog: questions --
speaker_heading: RAGETTI
dialog: Or to question the answer that you may
dialog: give to such a question --
speaker_heading: PINTEL
dialog: Which by right -- you need not answer -—
speaker_heading: RAGETTI
dialog: But the men be asking to which port we
dialog: sail? Seeing as that British soldier
dialog: mentioned the name of a Captain Brand.
speaker_heading: PINTEL
dialog: A Captain as dead as any man who
text: dwells at the bottom of the sea.
speaker_heading: RAGETTI
dialog: And his crew -- very dead men one and
text: all. As the tale is told.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Tell the men we're searching for the
text: Trident of Poseidon. A treasure so
dialog: powerful it puts all others to shame.
speaker_heading: RAGETTI
dialog: But our ship is full of treasure, Sir.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Imagine all the warring nations having
dialog: to bid for their own survival. A
dialog: King’s ransom the likes of which no
dialog: pirate has ever seen! This be the
dialog: power of the Trident -- the last
dialog: treasure any man need hold.
text: Pintel and Ragetti look confused now.
speaker_heading: PINTEL
dialog: Last treasure?
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Now be the time to find a tranquil
dialog: island -- a place to put my leg up.
dialog: The Trident will be the last treasure
dialog: these hands possess.
speaker_heading: PINTEL
dialog: And this Captain Brand? What should
dialog: we tell the crew?
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Tell them we’re about to tap on his
dialog: door -- see if he’s home.
text: AND NOW WE SEE THE OUTLINE OF THE TRIANGLE IN THE DISTANCE --
text: THE THREE BORDER ISLANDS FORMING A VISION OF NAUTICAL HORROR —
scene_heading: - DARK CLOUDS AND FOG RESTING ABOVE THE WATER --
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: Gentlemen -- welcome to The Devil's
dialog: Triangle!
scene_heading: TWO LARGE ROCK FORMATIONS SERVE AS THE ENTRANCE -- AND
scene_heading: BARBOSSA IS SAILING STRAIGHT FOR THEM -- USING BLACKBEARD’S
text: SWORD TO MAKE WAY.
text: AND NOW BARBOSSA CALMLY SAILS HIS SHIP STRAIGHT TOWARD THE
scene_heading: DEVIL’S TRIANGLE -- USES HIS SWORD TO CONTROL THE WIND IN HIS
speaker_heading: SAILS --
text: THE CREW STARING OUT AT THE TRIANGLE IN THE DISTANCE -- ALL

scene_heading: EXT. -— JACK’S SHIP. - DAY

dialog: 40.
text: Carina coughing up water -- soaking wet and furious as she

scene_heading: THEM ALL -- CLEARLY SCARED --
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: How did I get here? Where are you
dialog: taking me?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Is that the thanks I get for saving
dialog: your neck?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: You're that pirate -- Jack Sparrow.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Captain Jack Sparrow.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: What do you want with me? Where is my
dialog: diary?
text: JACK HOLDS UP HER DIARY.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: It’s just a bunch of numbers. I'’11 be
dialog: needing that map. The Map No Man Can
dialog: Read.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: If you could read it -- then it
dialog: wouldn’t be called The Map No Man Can
dialog: Read.
speaker_heading: GIBBS
dialog: She's got a point there, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Most of the men on this ship can’t
dialog: read -- so that makes all maps The Map
dialog: No Man Can Read.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: If no one can read it -- then you have
dialog: no use for it or me.
speaker_heading: GIBBS
dialog: Hard to argue there, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I need to free a ship from a bottle.
dialog: And you have a map --
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Nobody has this map -- as it does not
dialog: exist --
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Then why does it have a name?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: The name clearly defines it as an
text: imperceptible object.
speaker_heading: SCRUM
dialog: I was about to say that.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Then we all agree there is no map?
speaker_heading: GIBBS
dialog: Settled!
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: You're confusing these poor men!
dialog: Which is what witches do best!
text: AND NOW THERE IS DEAD SILENCE -- THE CREW LOOKING TO JACK AND
scene_heading: STEPPING BACK IN FEAR --
speaker_heading: PIRATE #1
dialog: Did he say “witches”?
speaker_heading: PIRATE #2
dialog: Jack, tell us you didn’t bring a witch
dialog: on a ship?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Of course not. Look at her luminous
dialog: yellow hair. Those round and
dialog: bountiful -- eyes. Does she resemble
dialog: any witch you've seen?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: I am not a witch.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: You see. Not a witch.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: I’m an astronomer.
speaker_heading: PIRATE #2
dialog: Oh, so you make hats?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
text: An astronomer contemplates the stars.
dialog: The planets. This is what I was doing
dialog: when they arrested me. I had mapped
dialog: the solar system.
text: A LONG BEAT AS THEY ALL STARE AT HER --—
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CREW MEMBER #3
dialog: SHE'S A WITCH!
text: Jack steps in front of her now -- draws his sword and puts it
text: at her throat.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Allow me to simplify this equation.
dialog: Give me that map or I'll let them kill
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: If they kill me you’1ll never get the
dialog: map.
speaker_heading: GIBBS
dialog: Excellent bit of reasoning there,
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: YOU ARE EXCUSED, MR. GIBBS!!!
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: You can kidnap me, imprison me, kill
dialog: me if you wish. But I’1ll never give
dialog: you what you want!
text: And now Jack puts the sword away.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: What I want is a cup of tea. Care to
dialog: join me?
scene_heading: INT. - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS. - DAY
text: Carina is staring at her own hand -- can barely keep her eyes
text: open. SHE IS CLEARLY DRUNK -- trying desperately to focus.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: What kind of tea did you say it was?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Pirate’s tea. Family recipe.
text: JACK STANDS BEHIND HER SPIKING HER TEA WITH RUM.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: It has a funny taste. I can’t quite
dialog: figure it out --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Unlike The Map No Man Can Read? Which
dialog: you have solved.
scene_heading: SHE SMILES NOW -- DRINKS SOME MORE --—
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Can you keep a secret, Captain Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Why steal secrets if you’re not going
dialog: to keep them?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: There’s a reason the Map has never
dialog: been read by any man. Or woman.
text: She leans in close now -- whispers to him.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
text: The Map is written in the stars.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
text: Someone must have an enormous quill.
text: SHE TAKES OUT A SMALL BLACK BOOK --
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Galileo's diary dates back to the
dialog: first astronomer -- Plato himself.
dialog: The diary is full of celestial
dialog: binomials -- equations passed down
dialog: through the centuries from scholar to
dialog: scholar -- the last being my father.
dialog: None of them could figure it out.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: But you have?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Once every 243 years the planet Venus
text: crosses directly in front of Orion’s
dialog: Belt -- known as the Three Fingers of
dialog: God. This event is known as The
dialog: Transit of Venus.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I'll drink to that.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: This is the answer to the equation.
text: With a clear sky the stars themselves
dialog: will map the Devil’s Triangle.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: A map that will lead you to the Tomb
text: of Poseidon. And the Trident inside.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: How could you know about the Trident?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: You're not the only witch in town.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: After tonight -- I’1l never be called
dialog: a witch again!
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Tonight?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: As the sun sets -- my destiny begins!
text: AND NOW CARINA PASSES OUT -- SHE’S FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I hate destiny.

scene_heading: HORRIFYING TO LOOK AT -- A MILITARY UNIT STILL IN UNIFORM -—

scene_heading: BRAND STOPS JUST BEFORE HE REACHES BARBOSSA -- LOOKS TO HIS
scene_heading: LEFT AND SEES THE ROCK FORMATIONS -- WHICH SERVE AS THE
text: BORDER FOR THE TRIANGLE.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
dialog: You've kept half of your ship outside

speaker_heading: CAPTRAIN BRAND

speaker_heading: BARBOSSA

speaker_heading: CAPTRAIN BRAND

speaker_heading: BARBOSSA

speaker_heading: CAPTRAIN BRAND

dialog: have is your life to bargain with.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: I come with a tale.
speaker_heading: CAPTRAIN BRAND
dialog: And what would this tale be about?
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: There was a British Captain. A
dialog: Captain who had in his command his own
dialog: brother -- a brother by the name Eric.
text: The two men never far apart.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK --
text: WE SEE YOUNG CAPTAIN JOHN BRAND AND HIS BROTHER ERIC FIGHTING
text: SIDE BY SIDE ON A BRITISH WAR SHIP -- THE TWO MEN SHOOTING AT
scene_heading: A SPANISH GALLEON --—
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: SUDDENLY THEIR SHIP GETS ROCKED BY CANNON FIRE -- THE
scene_heading: EXPLOSION BLOWING ERIC OVERBOARD --—
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: While engaged in battle with the
dialog: Spanish, Eric was lost to the sea --
text: sinking beneath the waves.
text: WE SEE CAPTAIN BRAND REACHING FOR HIS BROTHER -- HOLDING HIM
text: OVER THE SIDE -- BUT UNABLE TO BRING HIM UP. THROUGH THE
scene_heading: SMOKE CAPTAIN BRAND SEES ERIC DROWNING IN THE DEEP WATER --
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And so this Captain’s heart was broken
dialog: -- knowing he would never see his
dialog: brother again.
scene_heading: EXT. —- OPEN OCEAN. - DAY (FLASHBACK)

scene_heading: OUT OF THE WATER --
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA (V.O.)

dialog: dragged Eric from certain death and
text: put him in chains.
text: WE SEE ERIC ON THE PIRATE SHIP IN CHAINS -——
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA (V.O.)
dialog: At first they thought to hold him for
dialog: ransom, but then the Captain of this

text: WE SEE ERIC TRYING TO STEAL AN APPLE FROM THE SHIP -- IS
text: ABOUT TO EAT IT WHEN HE IS SUDDENLY CAUGHT BY SURPRISE --
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA (V.O.)
dialog: And this Captain decided to train him
dialog: in the ways of the pirate. Taught him
dialog: everything he knew -- how to steal and
dialog: plunder -- how to enjoin a group of
text: knaves who refuse all orders.
text: ERIC NO LONGER LOOKS LIKE A SOLDIER. HE RESEMBLES A PIRATE
text: IN DRESS AND APPEARANCE -- IS HANDED HIS OWN JOLLY ROGER
speaker_heading: FLAG.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA (V.O.)
dialog: He was taught every vile trick this
dialog: Captain knew, until Eric was ready to

speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: So that was a mutiny. I must admit it
dialog: was rather exciting. All those swords
dialog: and guns. The larger men holding you
dialog: down and beating you when you refused
text: to leave. The smaller men lining up
dialog: to slap you --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: You just cost me the command of two
dialog: ships.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Two?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
text: One was in a bottle. Long story.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: And you blame me? The woman you

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: You were the only witch on the ship.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: I am not a witch!
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: And I am not a Captain!
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: On that we both agree.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: In case you have forgotten, the
dialog: aforementioned kidnapping also
dialog: included the saving of your neck --
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: You did not save me out of courtesy.
dialog: You seek the Trident --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I have no choice. There’s a ghost who
text: dwells in the haunted waters of the
text: Triangle, a spirit plotting his
dialog: escape.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: A spirit?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I have to find the Trident before he

scene_heading: CARINA STARING AT HIM -- CAN’T HELP BUT LAUGH --
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Ghosts! That is what all of you

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Yes. Ghosts. And lizards. And
dialog: Quakers.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: I assure you, there are no ghosts in
dialog: the Devil’s Triangle or anywhere else.
dialog: Science does not support it.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: And if you're wrong?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Did I not predict the crossing of
dialog: Venus?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: You think you’re the only one who
dialog: knows anything about Venus? Venus was
dialog: the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: And who taught you that?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: A girl named Venus --
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Was she academically inclined?
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
text: More like vertically reclined.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: My calculations are precise and true.
dialog: I’m not just an astronomer -- I’m also
dialog: a horologist.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: No shame in that, dear. We all have
dialog: to earn a living.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: No. A Horologist!
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Yes. So was Venus. Although she
dialog: didn’t shout it quite as loud as you.
dialog: I must say you seem very proud!
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Horology is the study of time.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
text: She was constantly studying her watch.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Time is everything, Captain Sparrow.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I prefer timing.
text: CARINA HOLDS UP THE WATCH AROUND HER NECK.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: This Chronometer keeps the exact time
dialog: in London. If I make an altitude
dialog: measurement to a known heavenly body
dialog: such as the sun -- we will find land.
scene_heading: LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE CHRONOMETER -- BLINDING JACK.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: That thing will draw attention where

speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: East is that way. Row!
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: You are sailing with Captain Jack
dialog: Sparrow. I will find land with this
dialog: compass. A compass which takes me to
dialog: the exact place I wish to go.

speaker_heading: ADMIRAL SCARFIELD (CONT’D)
dialog: Read it or die.
text: MELIA SLOWLY REACHES UP AND TOUCHES THE MAP -- AND SUDDENLY
text: WE SEE A DROP OF BLOOD ON THE WALL. THE DROP TURNS INTO
scene_heading: SEVERAL BLOODY LINES -- LINES WHICH START TO RUN TOGETHER AND
scene_heading: FORM AN IMAGE. AN IMAGE THAT RESEMBLES A TRIDENT. THE
scene_heading: BRITISH SOLDIERS NERVOUS NOW --

speaker_heading: ADMIRAL SCARFIELD (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
dialog: Where did you get that earring?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: A gift from my father -- a father I
dialog: never knew.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
text: A clover is bad luck at sea. He
dialog: wasn’t a sailor.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: He was a scientist. The earring was

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Nothing compares with the beauty of
dialog: the sea.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Don’t you ever look up?
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Only when I’m flat on my back. You
dialog: take your stars, and I'll take my
dialog: horizon.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
text: They are forever connected. A map
dialog: maker’s sextant calculates the angle

text: the horizon existing as lovers.
text: AND NOW JACK STARES AT HER --

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Lovers? As in we’re lost at sea and

speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: May I say that for someone with such

speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH

text: CARINA LOOKS OVER AT FOUR MEN --—
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Bad luck for a man of the sea to ask

speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Then I shall go right away. I’m glad
dialog: I can finally trust you.

speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Eric the Pirate.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA

speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: I know an unfinished treasure map when
dialog: I see one. Now who holds the rest of
dialog: it?
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: I’m not sure. I finished the equation
dialog: -- did everything right. It should be
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Equation?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Handed down to me in Galileo’s Diary.
dialog: An equation no man had ever solved --
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: To find a Map No Man Could Read?
scene_heading: BARBOSSA STANDS THERE NOW -—
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve heard of such a map. But this
dialog: can’t be it.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: I copied that map from the stars,
dialog: where it was hidden for thousands of
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Impossible. No woman can read the
dialog: stars.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: So you believe you know more of the

speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
dialog: On that I’d wager.

speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX
dialog: Henry Maddox. I made my way to
dialog: Coronation Bay to secure passage back

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Back?
speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX
dialog: I was aboard the massacre of the
dialog: Monarch.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: So you survived Captain Brand?
speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX
dialog: As did a girl. I knew her less than a
dialog: day. But I promised her I'd find her -
dialog: - save her.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: A word of advice, Henry. Risking your
dialog: life for women in distress is a
dialog: laborious way to make a living. Much
dialog: better to cause the distress, kidnap
text: the women, then take a ransom.
speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX
dialog: I will rescue her.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Being as your aspirations are to
dialog: rescue -- why not start with me?
speaker_heading: HENRY MADDOX
dialog: I know not what you’ve done, Sir.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: It’s not what I’ve done -- it’s what

text: IN THE DISTANCE WE SEE THE TWO ROCKS THAT FORM THE BORDER OF
scene_heading: THE TRIANGLE --
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Mr. Barbossa, what will you do with
dialog: Jack when we get there?
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: There's a price to pay for finding
dialog: things not meant to be found.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: And Jack's life is that price?
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: I'll be trading an eye for an eye.
dialog: You may have the map -- but I’1l have
text: the key. In the shape of a diamond.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: He’s a fellow pirate, is he not?
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Do you desire to find the Trident?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: More than you could know.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: To what end, might I ask?
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: I will present it to the King -- hand
dialog: him his greatest treasure. And from
dialog: that day forward my name will be
dialog: pronounced with high regard. And I’1l
dialog: never be called a witch again.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: So Jack's life is a reasonable
dialog: expense. Wouldn’t you agree?
text: And now he looks at her -- sees her concern.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: You have no loyalty.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
text: A pirate’s life is spent loyal to the
dialog: sea.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
text: The sea is not alive, Mr. Barbossa.
dialog: It cannot return favor.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Nor can any pirate.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: So you feel nothing for any living
dialog: soul?
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA

dialog: see, Captain Brand -- I’ve come to

speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: The diamond, Jack. I saw you pocket
dialog: it.
text: JACK LIFTS THE DIAMOND FROM HIS POCKET --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I’m confused, Hector. You made a deal
dialog: with the dead to trade my life for The
dialog: Eye -- only to save my life from the
dialog: very dead man who was supposed to take
dialog: it -- and now you wish to kill me dead
dialog: all over again.

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Hold your tongue, Jack. Before I cut
dialog: it out.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: As one who is recently married, I can
dialog: suggest you don’t rush into this --
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
speaker_heading: ENOUGH! !
scene_heading: AND NOW JACK GRABS BARBOSSA’S HAND -- TURNS HIS WRIST OVER TO
text: EXPOSE A TATTOO OF A CLOVER.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I’ve seen that clover before.
text: Dangling from Carina’s ear. Bad luck
dialog: for a sailor. But not a pirate named
dialog: Barbossa.
scene_heading: JACK STARING AT HECTOR NOW -—
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
dialog: And there were pirate markings in her
text: diary. Clover in shape next to the
dialog: equation. The question being, how did
text: she end up with a book that was once
dialog: in the possession of pirates?
scene_heading: BARBOSSA GRABS HIM NOW -- HESITATES FOR A BEAT -- REALIZES
dialog: HE’S GOT NO CHOICE.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Aye. The book was stolen by pirates.
dialog: Pirates who had no way of reading it.
dialog: So when it came to my hands thirty
dialog: years ago, I passed it down. As it
dialog: was all I had to offer.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Passed it down?
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
text: To a three year-old child. The most
dialog: beautiful child you’ve ever seen. A
dialog: child I was never to lay eyes on
dialog: again.
text: Jack staring at Hector.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
dialog: She's my daughter, Jack. Carina was
dialog: named by me, and then left with
dialog: nothing but a book stolen long ago.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
text: And a dead man’s tale of a father she
dialog: never knew?
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Lies given to her by her mother so she
dialog: would never be faced with the truth of
dialog: what I am. And she took to those lies
dialog: and made them true -- studied by
dialog: herself until she alone could pull a
dialog: map from the stars. And now we both
dialog: chase the same treasure -- as our
dialog: destiny allows.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: You're certain of this, Hector? With
dialog: all respect, you’re one of the most
dialog: hideous men I’ve ever met. There be
dialog: little resemblance.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Her mother was a raven haired beauty --
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I know mirrors are hard to come by at
dialog: sea -- so you might not be aware of
dialog: your own unsightly face --
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
text: SHE’S MY DAUGHTER, JACK! AND THIS
text: SECRET WILL GO TO BOTH OF OUR GRAVES.
text: SHE MUST NEVER KNOW THE TRUTH!
dialog: 88.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: Sounds like an accord is to be struck.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: Name your price.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: I only came for the Pearl and my life.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: All I wish to hold is the Trident.
speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW
dialog: We have an accord.
text: JACK AND BARBOSSA SHAKE ON IT -- BUT BARBOSSA PULLS HIS GUN
text: AND HOLDS IT TO JACK’S THROAT.
speaker_heading: BARBOSSA
dialog: A small stipulation. I’ve seen the
dialog: way her eyes find you, Jack. You’ll
dialog: be staying away from Carina --
dialog: forever. She must never know the
dialog: pirate’s life.
text: Barbossa walking toward Jack now.

dialog: We should keep moving. This island is
text: alive -- and so is Hector.
scene_heading: JACK STILL TRYING TO MOVE PAST HER -- KNOWS BARBOSSA WILL
text: KILL HIM ON SIGHT. BUT SHE WON’T LET HIM PASS.
speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
dialog: Whatever happens, I just want you to

speaker_heading: JACK SPARROW

speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH

speaker_heading: CARINA SMYTH
