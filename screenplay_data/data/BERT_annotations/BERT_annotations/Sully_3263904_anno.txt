text: And it is too quiet in here. So he remotes on the TV.

speaker_heading: SULLY

dialog: executing. A forced water
dialog: landing.
speaker_heading: BEN EDWARDS
dialog: Why didn’t you attempt to return
dialog: to LaGuardia?
speaker_heading: SULLY
dialog: There was simply not enough
dialog: altitude. The river was the only
dialog: place long enough, wide enough,
dialog: and smooth enough to even attempt
dialog: to land the airplane safely.
speaker_heading: BEN EDWARDS
dialog: Air Traffic testified that you
dialog: stated you were returning to
dialog: LaGuardia. But you didn’t.
speaker_heading: SULLY
dialog: As I began the left turn, I
dialog: realized I couldn’t make it back.
dialog: It would have ruled out all other
dialog: options. Returning would have
dialog: been a mistake.
speaker_heading: CHARLES PORTER
dialog: Let’s get into how you calculated
dialog: all those parameters.
speaker_heading: SULLY
dialog: There wasn’t time for calculating.
dialog: I had to rely on my experience of
dialog: managing the altitude and speed on
dialog: thousands of flights, over four
dialog: decades.
speaker_heading: CHARLES PORTER
dialog: You're saying you...
speaker_heading: SULLY
text: Eyeballed it.
speaker_heading: CHARLES PORTER
dialog: You eyeballed it?
speaker_heading: SULLY

speaker_heading: SULLY
dialog: Engineers are not pilots. They’re
dialog: wrong. And they weren’t there.
speaker_heading: BEN EDWARDS
dialog: Regardless, we have to follow up
dialog: all implications as part of our
dialog: investigation.
speaker_heading: CHARLES PORTER
dialog: Our computers will run return
dialog: scenario algorithms to generate
dialog: simulations with your exact
dialog: parameters. The dual engine loss,
dialog: the altitude. Everything you
dialog: faced when you made your decision.
speaker_heading: SULLY
dialog: I'd like to oversee those computer
dialog: simulations.
speaker_heading: BEN EDWARDS
dialog: Not possible during an
dialog: investigation.
speaker_heading: CHARLES PORTER
dialog: You stated it was a dual engine
dialog: failure due to multiple bird-
dialog: strikes.
speaker_heading: BEN EDWARDS
dialog: That would be unprecedented.
speaker_heading: SULLY
dialog: Everything is unprecedented.

speaker_heading: SULLY

speaker_heading: CHARLES PORTER
dialog: And we appreciate your

dialog: because Captain Sullenberger

dialog: Unit.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH DAVIS
dialog: He was simply following the QRH...
speaker_heading: SKILES

text: The board leans forward. Interested.

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH DAVIS
