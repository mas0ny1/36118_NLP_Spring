scene_heading: EXT. GULF OF ADEN - NIGHT - (DISSOLVE INTO)
text: The MOONLIGHT reflects off the calm dark body of water. Way
text: in the distance FAINT LIGHTS on shore indicate a hint of the

text: 25,000 ton CARGO SHIP (THE CHEMSTAR) is barely discernible.
scene_heading: EXT. CHEMSTAR —- NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. SHIP - NIGHT
text: The heavy DOOR to a large unit STORAGE ROOM swings open
text: revealing the kidnapped crew. They are thoroughly exhausted

text: In very tight unsteady angles we see glimpses of the SOMALIAN
text: PIRATES charging into the room and yanking hostages to their
text: feet. Some are savagely kicked and jerked upright by KNOTTED

speaker_heading: SHIP’S STAIRCASE
text: The DARK METAL STAIRCASE reverberates loudly as frenetic
text: SHAFTS OF LIGHT from the PIRATES’ FLASHLIGHTS cut through the
text: gloom as the BOUND HOSTAGES are kicked and shoved down toward
text: the bowels of the ship.
scene_heading: EXT. - SHIP
text: The only sound heard is the LAPPING WAVES that strike the

text: ‘Thermal Vision POV’ moves steadily closer.
scene_heading: INT. - SHIP
text: The BOUND HOSTAGES are being shoved and kicked into the
text: center of the ship’s HOLD. High above the HOLD are open CARGO
text: DOORS that reveal the dark night sky. TWO PIRATES stand guard
text: above the ‘HOLD’ watching the HOSTAGES being abused below.
text: Waiting in the hold are another FIFTEEN PIRATES who are
text: sitting on STACKS OF CARGO drinking and smoking. The whole
text: environment has the feel of a distorted amphitheater whose
dialog: attendees want blood.
speaker_heading: SHIP’S HOLD
text: The HOSTAGES are dragged into the center of the METAL CARGO
text: AREA. The PIRATES mock their pleas for ‘help’ and burning
text: CIGARETTES and empty BEER BOTTLES are tossed at the FRENCH

text: The LEADER orders another PIRATE holding a small VIDEO CAMERA
text: to begin filming. Around them are STACKS of the cargo, which
dialog: is SALT.
text: The LEADER paces behind the doomed HOSTAGES and begins to
dialog: speak in English, which is the SOMALI’S second language.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: (accented English)
dialog: We had these men too long! Three

dialog: nothing!! You do not care about

dialog: we do not care!
dialog: 
text: The LEADER angrily gestures to the PIRATE beside him.
text: The PIRATE disdainfully drags a HOSTAGE forward and yanks his
text: bound hands upward.
text: The GAGGED HOSTAGE’S muffled cries for mercy fall on deaf
text: ears. The PIRATE GANG clamors for blood.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: (playing to the camera)
dialog: These workers need their hands! But
dialog: the owners of this ship do not want
dialog: to pay! That means to me that you

speaker_heading: SHIP’S HOLD
text: The MACHETE is about to descend when they are startled by a

text: Full of adrenaline, the PIRATES aim their array of WEAPONS
text: upward and are about to fire when the RED BEAM from a LASER
text: LIGHT appears on the LEADER’S CHEST.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: (to his men)
dialog: No!
dialog: (in Somali)
dialog: Don’t shoot!! Who is there?
text: The PIRATE with the PORTABLE CAMERA pans upward. It records

dialog: later scene.)
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP’S DECK - NIGHT

text: YING YANG: Thoughtful, deadly and a master at ‘close quarter
dialog: combat.’ He’s a man who’s always meditating on how he should

text: TOLL ROAD: His imposing size and battle scarred appearance
text: belie his special DEMOLITION SKILLS and calm intellect.
scene_heading: SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 5
text: When all else fails, he simply employs his brutal but
text: brilliant fighting capabilities to shatter every bone in an
text: opponent’s body. He wears special GLOVES with protruding
text: STUDS and METAL KNEE PADS.
text: GUNNAR JENSEN: A big combat veteran who’s an expert in
text: PRECISION SNIPING, but the years of stress, isolation and
text: cynicism have spiraled him downwards into an unwinnable war
dialog: of substance abuse and untamable mood swings.
text: All of these men possess a matching EXPENDABLES LOGO TATTOO.
speaker_heading: YANG
text: has a LASER DOT from his rifle centered on the LEADER’S
text: CHEST, as BARNEY addresses the THIEF.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: There’s the money - Free the
dialog: hostages.
text: Unimpressed, the PIRATE LEADER looks at the LASER DOT on his
text: chest, then runs his fingers through the BEAM. He motions to
text: another PIRATE who retrieves the BAG. The LEADER looks
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: (hard)
dialog: How much in there?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Three million.
speaker_heading: LEADER

speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: We want our money! Now!
speaker_heading: GUNNAR
dialog: - Warnin’ shot!!
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: No!!
text: GUNNAR pulls the trigger sending a heavy grained bullet into
text: center of the LEADER'S face.
text: The film goes into SLOW MOTION. The PIRATE LEADER’S head is
text: completely gone. The stunned PIRATES stare in horror as the
text: LEADER’S body still remains upright. The EXPENDABLES exchange
text: anxious looks. They know the scene is milliseconds away from
dialog: chaos.
speaker_heading: GUNNAR
dialog: (simply)
dialog: ..-Little low.
text: With that the PIRATE LEADER’S body crumbles to a heap and the
dialog: battle is on!
scene_heading: CHRISTMAS and HALE CAESAR toss TWO M-18 SMOKE GRENADES from

text: GUNNAR steps into view, his wild eyes craving the battle.
speaker_heading: YING YANG
text: He leaps out from behind a CARGO STACK and catches a PIRATE
text: with a savage kick from his STEEL TIPPED BOOTS, then sprays a
text: SECOND PIRATE with his MACHINE GUN.
speaker_heading: PIRATES
text: In the shadowy ‘hold,’ the PIRATES are panicking and firing
text: wildly. BULLETS ricochet off the SHIP’S STEEL SIDE with
text: deafening reverberations.
text: HALE CAESAR is hit in the PROTECTIVE VEST. He fires his SEGA
text: SHOTGUN and obliterates STACKS of CARGO that the assaulting
text: PIRATE hides behind.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
text: leaps from cover and heaves a KNIFE at a PIRATE who is
text: reloading, then fires his WEAPON three times at a PIRATE who
text: dives safely behind a CARGO STACK. The PIRATE now fires at
text: BARNEY. TOLL ROAD suddenly appears behind the PIRATE and
text: snaps his NECK.
speaker_heading: BARNEY ROSS
text: BARNEY ducks then spins out and with amazing economy he fires
text: off eight shots with his .45, hitting TWO ARMED PIRATES,
text: then, speed loads and fires off SIX more at another PIRATE

speaker_heading: GUNNAR

speaker_heading: PISTOL.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
text: is out of AMMO, but sees TWO PIRATES and with insane speed,
text: he whips out a pair of THROWING KNIVES and impales the
text: thieves. A THIRD PIRATE tries to behead him from behind with
text: a MACHETE. CHRISTMAS dodges the blow and crushes the man’s
text: THROAT with a lethal blow.
speaker_heading: PIRATE
text: drops his empty WEAPON and whips out his MACHETE and
text: anxiously moves forward.
speaker_heading: TOLL ROAD
text: A STUDDED FIST slams into the PIRATE’S CHEST. The man

scene_heading: REMINGTON MODEL 870 MCS ‘breach weapon.’
speaker_heading: BARNEY

text: with his .45.
speaker_heading: GUNNAR’S

dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: What’re you doing?!
text: GUNNAR fires missing CHRISTMAS’ HEAD by an inch, but catching

speaker_heading: GUNNAR
dialog: Got ya!
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
text: Heaves another KNIFE at a PIRATE who runs between the CARGO

speaker_heading: TOLL ROAD

scene_heading: SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 10
speaker_heading: HALE CAESAR
text: approaches from the opposite direction and drives his ELBOW
text: squarely into his FOREHEAD, then pulling out a huge dagger-
text: like KNIFE aptly called ‘The Arkansas Toothpick,’ parries
text: another PIRATE’S MACHETE and with a stupendous elbow to the
text: forehead, crushes him to the SHIP’S FLOOR.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
text: Clearing his way around the CARGO, he sees EIGHT PIRATES
text: snatch up the BOUND HOSTAGES, using them as a shield. A very

text: his throat.
speaker_heading: TALL PIRATE
dialog: (insanely)
dialog: We kill them! We kill them!
text: BARNEY sees what CHRISTMAS sees. HALE CAESAR drifts into view
text: and blocking the steps, likewise TOLL ROAD, YANG joins in
text: from the opposite angle. They are all blocking the stairway
speaker_heading: EXIT.
speaker_heading: TALL PIRATE
dialog: Drop the weapons!
text: The PIRATES have weapons pointed at the HOSTAGES’ heads. The
text: MERCENARIES look toward BARNEY, who remains stone faced.
speaker_heading: TALL PIRATE
dialog: We kill them all! I don’t care!
text: BARNEY lowers his PISTOLS to the ground, likewise the TWO

speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
text: Got the four on the left.
speaker_heading: BARNEY

speaker_heading: TALL PIRATE

dialog: Kill them -
text: Like a blur BARNEY quick-draws a custom built SIX SHOOTER
text: from the small of his back as CHRISTMAS’ whips out TWO
text: THROWING KNIVES hidden behind his shoulders with blinding
text: speed, then whips out TWO MORE fastened to either side of his
text: leg. It’s hard to tell which is faster, BARNEY’S BULLETS or
text: CHRISTMAS’ KNIVES, but EIGHT DEAD PIRATES hit the ground.
text: Stone-faced BARNEY moves forward and begins cutting the

speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS

speaker_heading: GUNNAR
dialog: They’d do it to us!!
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
dialog: (to Barney)
text: Put one in his leg.

scene_heading: BARNEY AND CHRISTMAS

speaker_heading: GUNNAR

speaker_heading: GUNNAR

dialog: feet.
text: GUNNAR prepares to likewise leap up, only to find BARNEY

speaker_heading: TOLL ROAD
dialog: Sorry, Brother.
text: At this moment the LONG HAIRED PIRATE begins to regain

scene_heading: INT. PALACE (GARZA’S CHAMBERS) - NIGHT
text: Sipping whiskey, GENERAL GARZA sits behind his desk. He idly
text: touches the BARREL of a MINIATURE CANNON that is a DESK
text: ORNAMENT, as MONROE, PAINE and OPERATIVE #2 and #3 enter. His
text: room is only lit by EXTENSIVE CANDLE LIGHT. Some of the
text: CANDLES are immense, OVER SIX FEET TALL.
speaker_heading: PAINE
dialog: Downstairs I saw soldiers with
dialog: painted faces. So is there a
dialog: reason you’ve taken men I’ve broke
dialog: my ass to train to be serious
dialog: combat personnel and painted them?
speaker_heading: GARZA
dialog: They look like warriors!
speaker_heading: PAINE
dialog: They look like fools!
speaker_heading: GARZA
dialog: Warriors loyal to me - When does
dialog: the battle begin?
speaker_heading: MONROE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Battle? Everything’s under control.
speaker_heading: GARZA
text: From that side of the room, maybe.
dialog: From this side nothing is under
dialog: control. I can see you thinkin’
dialog: ‘the General’s not thinkin’
dialog: straight.’ Yes, that could be, but
dialog: it is also you that is not thinkin’
dialog: right and I can see you want to go
dialog: and not see me again until the
dialog: morning. No, stay! I want company -
dialog: You will watch me paint.
text: THREE RED BERETS block the exit, they’re ready to fight.
text: MONROE glares at GARZA, who stares blankly into his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. PALACE COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: A RED BERET GUARD carrying an AUTOMATIC WEAPON is patrolling
text: beside the palace.
text: A BLUR passes in front of the SOLDIER’S face as YANG kicks

text: alertly scan the area. Just off to the side is FAINT LIGHT
text: emanating from a GRATE.
speaker_heading: HALE CAESAR
dialog: ...Nice view.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Alright, it’s 3:36. We’ve got 20
dialog: minutes to bring this place down -
dialog: I‘ll take the cellar.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. COURTYARD - NIGHT
text: The majority of the regular SOLDIERS are in their makeshift
text: TENT BARRACKS located in the FRONT COURTYARD. The painted
text: face RED BERETS still stand guard over the PALACE ENTRANCE.
scene_heading: INT. PALACE - NIGHT
text: A pair of GUARDS are stationed at the end of a long corridor.
text: TOLL ROAD comes into view. His SILHOUETTE is seen dashing
text: across the hallway past the slumping guards...He places
text: another RADIO ACTIVATED CHARGE against a SUPPORT COLUMN, then
text: gracefully disappears.
scene_heading: BASEMENT TUNNELS
text: BARNEY exits a staircase and moves down the dim corridor.
text: Flipping on a MINI LIGHT attached to his assault RIFLE, he
text: eyes the cross section of a bearing wall overhead.
scene_heading: GENERAL GARZA'S CHAMBER
text: With his eyes fixated on the CANVAS, GARZA stares dully
text: straight ahead as MONROE is seated behind GARZA’S desk. As
text: MONROE eyes the PHOTOS of SANDRA, his mind races.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
text: On the second floor, he places an EXPLOSIVE in another
dialog: strategic locale.
speaker_heading: HALE CAESAR

text: A FOOT flies out of the doorway knocking one guard cold. HALE
text: CAESAR sweeps the second GUARD off his feet and puts him to
text: sleep with an elbow to the forehead. He places an EXPLOSIVE
dialog: and splits.
scene_heading: EXT. - SECURITY FENCE
text: With the GUARDS idly pacing overhead, YANG plants a rigged
text: charge against a POST, then moves on to the next post.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
text: Moving along the basement tunnels, BARNEY moves further down
text: the corridor. By the glow of his MINI-FLASHLIGHT, he finds
text: another SUPPORT BEAM overhead. His attention is drawn to
text: tightly wrapped WHITE BRICKS. Drawing a knife, he cuts one
text: open and PURE COCAINE pours out.
speaker_heading: HALL GUARD (HALE CAESAR)
text: A SOLDIER minds his post. His eyes become alert when he hears
text: movement off to his side. Turning his head in that direction,
text: he peers into the dimly lit distance. Nothing there. Slowly
text: turning his head back, we see HALE CAESAR’S bone chilling
text: presence behind the GUARD. In a flash a python-like FOREARM
text: whips around his throat and they wipe from frame.
speaker_heading: YANG
text: plants another charge against the SECURITY FENCE. He reaches
text: in and opens the release TAPS to large GASOLINE STORAGE
text: CONTAINERS. The FLUID begins to flow along the fence.
speaker_heading: TOLL ROAD
text: A SOLDIER passes an alcove. TOLL ROAD leaps from view and in
text: a highly original maneuver, breaks him in half.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
text: slips down the hallway, approaching GENERAL GARZA’S Chambers
text: as he takes out a SENTRY.
text: CHRISTMAS drags the body into an ADJOINING ROOM as the LARGE

speaker_heading: YANG

speaker_heading: BARNEY
text: plants a charge against another portion of the palace’s
text: FOUNDATION. Again he sees more massive packaged STACKS of
text: COCAINE. Checking his WATCH, he bolts off with a heightened
dialog: sense of purpose.
speaker_heading: HALE CAESAR
text: is placing a CHARGE just as a GUARD holding a FLASHLIGHT
text: opens the door.
text: Without so much as a second of hesitation, HALE CAESAR steps
text: out of the darkness and skull butts the GUARD. He crumbles.
speaker_heading: TOLL ROAD
text: Climbs onto the PALACE ROOF. It is an eerie sight. Up ahead
scene_heading: are TWO SOLDIERS.
speaker_heading: CHRISTMAS
text: Climbs onto the PALACE ROOF. From his vantage point he can
text: see TOLL ROAD. He gestures to move ahead.
speaker_heading: ROOF GUARDS
text: Are at opposite ends of the wide roof. One turns and is
text: slammed squarely in the center of his face with a STUDDED
text: MUAY THAI knee kick. CHRISTMAS at nearly the same instant
text: renders his man unconscious. He stares over the edge at the
text: SOLDIERS mulling around in the COURTYARD, then places his
text: CHARGE. Likewise TOLL ROAD.
speaker_heading: BARNEY
text: glides down the dark stone corridor. He pauses. In the
text: distance, he sees the glow of a CIGARETTE belonging to one of
text: the TWO GUARDS standing in front of SANDRA’S dank cell. They
text: passe from view mumbling in Spanish.

scene_heading: SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 93
speaker_heading: SANDRA’S CELL
text: The GUARDS enter. The LARGER GUARD’S CIGARETTE is glowing in
text: the dim light. They stare down at SANDRA, who is bound to a
scene_heading: CHAIR and BLINDFOLDED.
scene_heading: GENERAL GARZA'S CHAMBERS - BALCONY
text: The GENERAL'S eyes are clouded over. PAINE and the TWO
text: OPERATIVES just stare at the unpredictable dictator. He makes
dialog: the final stroke.
speaker_heading: GARZA
dialog: ..-This clears the mind.
text: GARZA stares at MONROE with a long unnerving pause.
speaker_heading: MONROE
dialog: ...What?
text: We see the PAINTING as GARZA’S eyes bore into the CANVAS. It
text: is a painting of his daughter rushing past a burning
dialog: landscape.
speaker_heading: GARZA
dialog: Do you have puppets at home?
speaker_heading: MONROE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GARZA
dialog: No - But you think you have one
dialog: here in front of you - Do you think
dialog: I’m your puppet?
speaker_heading: MONROE
dialog: No, that’s just in your mind.
speaker_heading: GARZA
dialog: (rising)

speaker_heading: MONROE

speaker_heading: MONROE
dialog: I’m trying real hard to figure out
dialog: what’s going on in your head.
speaker_heading: GARZA
dialog: You! - You’re in there! I thought
dialog: maybe the people of Vilena paid
dialog: these mercenaries to kill me - I
dialog: thought that! But then I think
dialog: maybe this is your plan because you
dialog: can’t control me. Then I think that
dialog: torturing my daughter works for
dialog: you. I feel it. But she is now
dialog: loyal to me and you want to kill
dialog: her to make me suffer. A man can
dialog: never kill a child, but you can.
speaker_heading: MONROE
dialog: You’re losing your mind!
speaker_heading: GARZA
dialog: You do not control me anymore!
speaker_heading: MONROE
dialog: (losing it)
dialog: Control you? I own you!
text: The RED BERETS step forward, holding their WEAPONS at the
text: ‘ready.’ In the DIM CANDLELIGHT, they present a terrifying
dialog: vision.
speaker_heading: GARZA
dialog: (forcefully)
dialog: Nobody owns me! No more!! Bring my
dialog: daughter here! Bring her! She knows
dialog: who is doing this! Bring her now!
dialog: Bring her in front of me and I will
dialog: ask her if she is loyal to you or
dialog: me! Bring her or I'll kill all of
dialog: you!!
text: PAINE looks to MONROE, who’s thoroughly exasperated.
speaker_heading: MONROE
dialog: Get her!!
speaker_heading: 231 OMITTED
speaker_heading: 232 CELL GUARDS
text: One of the sleazy CELL GUARDS touches SANDRA’S hair, sampling
text: the texture. Blindfolded, she recoils and curses.
scene_heading: SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 95
text: The OTHER ONE touches her neck then her breasts. She curses
text: and spits in rage. The GUARD enjoys this and kicks her CHAIR
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Too good for us.
text: The SECOND GUARD draws hard on a CIGARETTE until the ember
text: glows firey RED.
text: As the GUARD goes to burn SANDRA, we see a bright STEEL BLADE
text: slash through the darkness and the hand holding the red hot
text: CIGARETTE is severed. Still blindfolded, SANDRA’S body
text: convulses when she hears the man’s anguished scream. BARNEY
text: then plunges the huge dagger’s blade into the other SOLDIER’S
text: chest, then silences the first SOLDIER’S SCREAMS with a neck
text: thrust. Their heavy bodies collapse beside SANDRA, who’s
text: screaming hysterically. BARNEY covers her mouth as he whips
text: off her BLINDFOLD.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: (hysterical in Spanish)
dialog: No! No! Don’t hurt me! No more!

text: crumbles. PAINE drops a knee to BARNEY’S midsection. The
text: other TWO OPERATIVES and a huge RED BERET SOLDIER step into
dialog: view.
text: OPERATIVE #2 grabs BARNEY in a lethal choke hold, yanking him

speaker_heading: PAINE
dialog: Who hired you?
speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Your boyfriend.

speaker_heading: OPERATIVE #1
dialog: Glad you came back.
text: OPERATIVE #1 unleashes an incredible barrage of kicks that

speaker_heading: OPERATIVE #1

speaker_heading: BARNEY
dialog: Your hairdresser.
text: Enraged, PAINE draws back for the killshot, just as YANG
text: drops through the overhead GRATE and brutally sidekicks PAINE
text: to the mid-section. He then kicks the American Operative
text: releasing BARNEY as YANG attacks Operative #1.
text: CHRISTMAS drops down next, slamming a potent ELBOW into
text: OPERATIVE #3’s JAW. TOLL ROAD comes charging out of the
text: darkness and tears into the RED BERET SOLDIERS, who
text: themselves are great fighters. PAINE moves out of the fray.
text: PAINE turns and is hit by BARNEY, which drives him back
text: slightly and they end up in a dismal, barely lit room. PAINE
text: uses his superior strength to dominate. BARNEY is slammed
text: hard to the brick floor. He goes to pull his short barrelled
text: PISTOL from behind his back. PAINE goes to stomp BARNEY, he
text: rolls and hooks PAINE’S leg. They roll around punches at
text: close quarters. BARNEY is on his feet and rains down a
text: torrent of punches that has PAINE on his heels.
speaker_heading: TUNNELS
text: Just as YANG, CHRISTMAS, and TOLL ROAD have subdued their

dialog: walls.
speaker_heading: PAINE
text: In a brutal choke hold, the escalated gunfire draws his
