dialog: Hallie
dialog: Okay, no I can't.
text: A skinny kid with a long neck, ZOE, steps in, carrying her duffel bag on
text: her shoulder and chewing gum.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You must be new.
dialog: Hallie
dialog: How can you tell?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You didn't know to grab your duffel before the apes tossed it

text: ten year-old in a tie-dye T-shirt, beads and a bandana around her head arrives and easily
text: pulls her duffel from the center of the pile.
dialog: Hallie
dialog: Now that's my kind of woman.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (cups hands around her mouth)
dialog: Hey!  Tie-Dye girl!
text: Nicole turns around.
dialog: Hallie
dialog: Would you mind giving me a hand?  My duffells the red one,
dialog: way in there.
text: Nicole nods and drops her duffel.  It LANDS right on Zoe's foot.
dialog: Hallie
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (grabbing her foot)
dialog: That would be negative.
text: Nicole yanks Hallie's duffel out of the pile and drops it on Zoe's other

dialog: Yo! Right here!
speaker_heading: MARVA JR.
dialog: (looks over and waves)
dialog: Arapaho!  Bunk eleven!
text: The Girls slap hands and head off toward their bunk.
dialog: Hallie
dialog: So, either of you by any chance know how
dialog: to play poker?
dialog: (Nicole and Zoe shake their
dialog: heads)
dialog: No? That's a shame.  So, tell me, how much cash did you guys bring
dialog: with you this summer?
text: As the Girls walk off, CAMERA BOOMS UP to a LIMOUSINE pulling up in
text: front of the MAIN LODGE.  Heads turn as the Driver, in a dark suit and cap, hops out
text: and opens the limousine's back door.  Out steps a PROPER BRITISH BUTLER, perfect
text: posture, elegant grey suit, extremely proper demeanor.  His name is MARTIN and he
text: speaks with a stuffy ENGLISH ACCENT.
text: Martin leans into the back-seat and takes the hand of an elegantly
text: dressed eleven year-old, Annie James.
text: Annie wears a powder blue suit and carries a purse and a small vanity case.  Her hair
text: is perfectly neat, shoulder length and worn with a powder blue head band.  As Annie
text: turns to Martin, we see her face and we realize SHE LOOKS ECACTLY LIKE
dialog: Hallie Parker!  Same hair color,
text: same eyes, same nose, same mouth, same height, same weight.  Identical in every way.
dialog: 5
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Well, here we are - Camp Walden For
dialog: Girls.
dialog: (looks around, with disdain)
dialog: We travelled six thousand miles for... this?
text: Annie looks around.  She also speaks with a BRITISH
text: ACCENT.
dialog: Annie
dialog: It's rather picturesque, wouldn't you
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I don't know if that's precisely the term
dialog: I would use.
text: Annie smiles as the Limo Driver lines up four pieces of matching luggage
text: by Martin's side.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: So, lets review, your Mother's list, shall
dialog: we?
dialog: (pulls out a typed list)
dialog: Vitamins?
dialog: Annie
dialog: Check.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Minerals?
dialog: Annie
dialog: Check.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: List of daily intake of fruits and vegetables?
dialog: Annie
dialog: Check.  Check.

dialog: Yours truly!
dialog: 6
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Annie
dialog: Got it all, I think.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Oh, and here's a little something from your
dialog: Grandfather, a
text: brand new deck of cards.
dialog: Maybe you'll find someone
dialog: on this continent
dialog: who can actually
dialog: whip your tush at poker.
dialog: Annie
dialog: I doubt it but
dialog: thanks.  And thanks for
dialog: bringing me, Martin.
text: Martin is suddenly overwhelmed with emotion.  He looks away, about
text: to burst into tears, quickly grabs Annie, hugs her tightly, then just as quickly - regains
text: his dignity.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: And remember, if you change your mind and want me to pick you
text: up at the end of camp, I'm only a phone-call away.
dialog: Annie
dialog: I'll be fine.  See you in eight weeks,
dialog: Marty ol’ pal.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Eight weeks it is, Queen of my Heart.
text: Annie puts out her hand, Martin places his hand over hers and they
text: proceed to do an extravagantly worked out SECRET HANDSHAKE - with all kinds of moves in it
text: including a butt bump, a wave under the chin and a shimmy to-and-fro.  When it's
text: over, Martin resumes his proper Butler demeanor and gets into the Limo.  As the Limo
dialog: pulls away, we HEAR:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARVA JR.
dialog: Annie James?
dialog: Annie
dialog: Yes, hello.  I apologize if I'm late.  My plane was
dialog: fogged in leaving Heathrow.  You )mow how- London is in June.

dialog: Can you manage?
speaker_heading: MARVA JR.
dialog: Manage?  Uh, sure... Suppose I can... Why
dialog: 
dialog: not?
text: Marva Jr. awkwardly gathers up all of Annie's luggage and leads her
text: toward her bunk.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARVA JR.
dialog: I know this sounds weird, but ... have we
dialog: met before?
text: -Marva accidentally steps in a gopher hole and stumbles forward...

dialog: Here you go.
dialog: Hallie
dialog: Got it!

text: what to say.  Just then, their friends join them and they immediately slip their
text: hands into their pockets - at the same time.  Their friends stop in their tracks and
text: look from Annie to Hallie - stunned at the resemblance.  The lunch bell RINGS and
text: everyone else on the lawn runs toward the Mess Hall.

dialog: Oh, that's my Dad... He didn't know I was taking a picture or

dialog: What's your dad like?  I mean, is he the kind of father
dialog: you can talk to or is he one of those workaholic types that says, 'I'll talk to you later,
dialog: honey', but never really does?  I hate that.
dialog: Annie
dialog: I don't have a father, actually.  I mean, I had one, once,
dialog: I suppose, but my parents divorced years ago.  My mother never even mentions
text: him.  It's like he evaporated into thin air or something.

dialog: Hallie
dialog: I never met her.  She and my Dad split up when I

dialog: even before, I'm not sure.  He doesn't like to talk about
dialog: her... but I know she was really beautiful.
dialog: Annie
dialog: How do you know that?
dialog: Hallie
dialog: Because my Dad had this old picture of her hidden in his sock
dialog: drawer and he caught me looking at it all the time so he gave it to me to keep.  I'm
dialog: really thirsty, you sure you don't want to go to the canteen and get something to drink?

dialog: Annie
dialog: Sisters?!?  Hallie, we're twins!!!
text: Frozen, Annie laughs then tears come to her eyes.  Hallie's eyes
text: fill up and soon tears streak her cheeks.  They put their arms around each other and
text: embrace, sobbing.  They pull apart, look at each other, smile, then begin to

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Because you missed your old man so much?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Annie
dialog: Exactly! it's because in my whole life, I mean for these past
dialog: eight weeks, I was never able to ever say the word 'Dad'. Never.  Not once!  And
dialog: a Dad is an irreplaceable person in a girls' life.  I mean think about it, there's a
dialog: whole day, devoted to celebrating Fathers, right?  Just imagine, someone's life
dialog: without a Father.  Never buying a Father's Day card, never getting their Father a'
text: birthday present, never sitting on their Father's lap, never being able to say, 'Hi, Dad',
text: 'What's up, Dad?,, 'Bye, Dad, catch you later, Dad'.  A baby's first words are always

speaker_heading: JOSE

dialog: Annie
dialog: (climbing out)
dialog: Yeah, he told me.
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: (hugging her)
dialog: it got too quiet around here, Hal.  We couldn't stand

text: getting stuck up on the roof...
text: Annie laughs as the screen door swings open and CHESSY EXITS, humming as

speaker_heading: CHESSY
dialog: What's with you, goofball!  It's Hallie.

scene_heading: INT. HALLIE'S ROOM

dialog: Annie-
dialog: Who’s the blonde?
speaker_heading: CHESSY
dialog: Hal, it's none of my business how your father makes a fool out
dialog: of himself, you understand?  He's a big boy, he can do what he wants.
dialog: Annie
dialog: Right.  So who is she?
speaker_heading: CHESSY
dialog: Her name's Meredith Blake.  She's a publicist from San
dialog: Francisco.  Your father hired her at the beginning of the summer to do some publicity
dialog: for the vineyard and if you ask me, she's done a better job selling herself than the
dialog: grapes.
dialog: Annie
dialog: Whaddya mean?
speaker_heading: CHESSY
dialog: Look, you and I )mow your Dad's no suave debonair Bachelor of
text: the Month-type, so I wonder what a young hot thing like her sees in a guy who walks around
text: with his shirt-tail hanging out and his cereal bowl full of chili.  Then I realized,
text: there's a .million reasons why that girl's giggling and they're all sitting in the Napa
dialog: Valley Community Bank.
dialog: Annie
dialog: You mean you don't think she even really likes Dad...
speaker_heading: CHESSY
dialog: -- What do I know?  But I'll tell you one thing.
dialog: This one could give Sharon Stone femme fatal lessons.  She's got your father eating
text: out of the palm of her hand.  They ride together, they swim together, they're out to
dialog: dinner every night.  Not to mention she treats yours truly like the shlepper help' of
dialog: all time which has really endeared her to me, as you can imagine. = you go down and meet
dialog: her and see for yourself.  Don't let me influence you.

scene_heading: INT.  LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

dialog: Hallie was a baby.
dialog: Annie
dialog: (admiring a photo)

dialog: Annie
dialog: I'll be twelve soon.  How old are you?
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: (a little thrown)
dialog: -- Twenty-six.
dialog: Annie
dialog: Only fourteen years older than me.  How old are you again, Dad?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: oh, suddenly she's interested in math.  I'm gonna get some
text: more chili and a bottle of champagne to celebrate.
dialog: Annie
dialog: What are we celebrating?
text: Nick pauses.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (jumping in)
dialog: You're home-coming of course.
text: Nick and Meredith exchange a quick look which is not lost on
text: Annie.  Nick heads toward the house as Annie sits by the pool, dunking her feet in
text: the water.  A cell-phone RINGS, Meredith flips it open.
speaker_heading: MERIDITH
dialog: Hello.  Yes, Reverend Mosby... Uh-huh.  I'll certainly ask him
dialog: but I doubt if he'll be
dialog: available.  I understand it's for a local charity.
dialog: Um-hmmm... I'm writing it all down.
dialog: (she writes nothing down)
dialog: Okay, got it.  Sounds very worthwhile, I-agree but
dialog: unfortunately, I see that Mr.
dialog: Parker will be out of the country those days.  Yes, I'll
dialog: be sure to mention it to him.  Thank you
dialog: (snaps phone shut)
dialog: So. How was camp, Hal?  Was it fabulous?
dialog: Annie
dialog: Yes, I loved it actually.  My Dad's going out of the
dialog: country?  When?
speaker_heading: MERIDITH
dialog: No, no, I just had to say that to get him out of something.
dialog: 
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: You know I never heard a man talk about his daughter the way
dialog: Nicky talks about you.  You two are obviously incredibly close.
dialog: Annie
dialog: We're closer than close.  We're all each other has...
text: Annie does a huge cannonball into the pool, SPLASHING water all over
text: Meredith.  Pissed, but controlling it, Meredith walks to the edge of the pool picks
text: up a towel and pats herself dry as Annie POPS to the surface.
dialog: Annie
dialog: Sorry, did I get you wet, Mer?
dialog: MEREDITH (trying to be sweet) just a little, Hal.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Hey, guess what?  Your Dad took me riding the other day
dialog: and he let me ride your horse.  I hope that's okay with you.
dialog: Annie
dialog: Oh, sure.  Sprout's used to strange women riding
dialog: her.  Not that you're strange or anything.- Actually, compared to the others, you
text: seem relatively normal.
dialog: (she floats on her back)
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: (curiosity getting the best of

dialog: Others?  What others?
dialog: Annie
dialog: What others?  Puh-leeze.

dialog: You want the 411?
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEREDITH
dialog: The 411?
dialog: Annie
dialog: The 'information'... the lowdown on the other women.
dialog: Can't say that I blame you.  I'd want to know if I was number twentyeight ... I
dialog: mean... number twenty-nine in a man's life.
speaker_heading: MERIDITH
dialog: I'm number twenty-nine?!
dialog: Annie
dialog: Well, yes but I didn't start counting ‘til I was about
dialog: four.  God knows how many there were before then. it's always the same routine...
text: horseback riding through the vineyards ... long romantic dinners with his special reserve
dialog: label wine... moonlight swims ...
dialog: (Meredith nods, intrigued)
dialog: But I always say, it's none of my business if a man his age
dialog: wants to make a fool out of himself.  Although, maybe he's changed and you're the
dialog: real thing, Mer.
text: Just then, Nick arrives with a bottle of Champagne.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: okay, here we go.  A bottle of my special reserve
dialog: label.  You girls find something to talk about while I was gone?

dialog: moment, Nick spots:
scene_heading: ELIZABETH - STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM
text: Nick blinks, unable to believe his eyes.  Elizabeth smiles and
dialog: gives him a little wave.'
text: Nick's EYES WIDEN as Meredith, her back to Elizabeth, continues kissing

dialog: Can one of you get me something cold for my head?

text: On that note, Martin passes through the room wearing only a SPEEDO
text: BATHING SUIT.  Elizabeth cracks open an eye, sits up.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Girls, your father's a grown man and quite capable of deciding whom he

dialog: Hallie
dialog: But she's all wrong for him.  And the only way he won't
dialog: marry her is...
dialog: (to Annie)
dialog: You tell her, she )knows you better.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (rises unsteadily)
dialog: okay, let me say this loud and clear.  Nick Parker and I
dialog: have nothing in common... anymore.  Plus, in case you haven't noticed, he seems
text: extremely content with his leggy, long haired, tight-skirted fiance.  I want the two
dialog: of you to explain to your father that I am here for one purpose only and that's to switch

dialog: That's not true.

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Now I know how a goldfish feels.
dialog: (re: Girls) '
dialog: They turned out pretty good though, huh?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: We've been lucky.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Sometime, if we're ever really alone maybe we could talk
dialog: about... what happened between us.  It all feels a bit hazy to me now... It ended so

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It started so fast.
speaker_heading: NICK

dialog: Elizabeth and Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So, what do we do about the girls?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Well, I guess now that they've met, we can't very well keep
dialog: them apart.  I could keep them half the year and you could--
speaker_heading: CHESSY
dialog: -- Guys, they can't go to two schools every year.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Okay, I could keep them for a whole year, then you

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Not we Lizzie...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You know that part's become a bit hazy for me too over the
dialog: years.
dialog: for me too over the years.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You don't remember the day you packed?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No, that day I remember perfectly.  Did I hurt you when I
dialog: threw that suitcase?  I've often wondered.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (rubbing his shoulder)
dialog: Let's put it this way, I'll never pitch for the Yankees.
dialog: 
dialog: (starts his soup, stops)
dialog: So how come you never got married again?  I always figured
dialog: by now you'd be re-married with a new family...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Me? No... no, no... no...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That's a lot of no’s..
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That's because I realized a long time ago marriage wasn't for
dialog: me...
text: A beat of silence.  Nick starts to eat again, stops.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You know I may be alone with you again, so... About the day you
dialog: packed... Why did you do it?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Nick, we were getting along so badly, we found out we each had
dialog: tempers, we said

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
