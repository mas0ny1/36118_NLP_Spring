speaker_heading: OVER BLACK
text: A MALE VOICE utters a single syllable- slowly, monotonously,
text: rhythmically.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Da... Da... Da... Da... Da...
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: WHITE WINDOWLESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The voice belongs to DR. HARRY MCGURK. In CLOSE UP, he stares
text: into the camera, now repeating a DIFFERENT SYLLABLE.
speaker_heading: MCGURK
scene_heading: ---Fa... Fa... Fa... Fa... Fa...
text: Offscreen, a FRIENDLY VOICE addresses the audience.
speaker_heading: FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Close your eyes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Close them.
speaker_heading: MCGURK
dialog: «..Da... Da... Da... Da... Da...
speaker_heading: FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: You hear “Da”. Now open them.
speaker_heading: MCGURK
dialog: «Fa... Fa... Fa... Fa... Fa...
speaker_heading: FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: You hear “Fa”. Close your eyes,
dialog: it’s “Da”. Open them, it’s “Fa”.
dialog: Weird, isn’t it?
dialog: (NOTE: This is a real neurological illusion. The McGurk
scene_heading: Effect. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-1N8vWm3m0 )
speaker_heading: FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Let’s try it a different way.
text: The SCREEN SPLITS into identical shots of Dr. McGurk. On the
text: LEFT, his mouth forms the word “Da”, on the RIGHT, “Fa”.
speaker_heading: FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Pick a side. I won’t tell you which
dialog: one. Is he saying Fa or Da?
dialog: (then)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Now look at the other side. What’s
dialog: he saying now?
dialog: (NOTE: Whoever looks left will hear ‘Da’ and whoever looks
dialog: right will hear ‘Fa’)
speaker_heading: FRIENDLY VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: The truth is that the sound hasn’t
dialog: changed- only the picture. All
dialog: we're hearing is ‘Da Da Da.’ But
dialog: when you look to the right, his
dialog: mouth forms the word ‘Fa.’ And your
text: poor brain, having seen lips form
dialog: this sound for your entire life is
dialog: powerless. It tells you to hear
dialog: ‘fa.’ It discounts reality and
dialog: gives you what it perceives to be
dialog: true.
dialog: (then)
dialog: So what's the point of all this you
dialog: ask? It’s this- Reality is not what
dialog: you see. It’s what you think you
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN NYC STREET / JEWELRY STORE - DAY
text: AN UPTOWN WOMAN in her late thirties lingers at the window.
text: Liking what she sees, she waves to the MERCHANT inside. He
text: BUZZES her in.
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Good afternoon...
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hi. I love that necklace...
scene_heading: INT. JEWELRY STORE - LATER
text: The Woman holds up a DIAMOND AND JADE NECKLACE, smiling.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Oh this one’s great too.
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Pure Jade. Mid-century,
dialog: untreated...
text: She puts it on a VELVET TRAY with SEVERAL OTHER ITEMS, turns
text: her attention to the DISPLAY CASE.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What about that one...?
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: The sautoir? Wonderful...
text: He opens the case and retrieves a SAUTOIR NECKLACE.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Ohh...
text: A light KNOCK at the door and the Merchant BUZZES another
text: CUSTOMER in. The woman holds the sautoir to her neck.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now this is beautiful. What do you
dialog: think?
dialog: 
text: The Merchant can’t help but notice how beautifully the
text: necklace drapes upon her cleavage.
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Perfect.
speaker_heading: FRIENDLY VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: I prefer the one in your coat,
dialog: Janice.
text: The familiar voice belongs to NICKY SPURGEON (33), dressed in
text: a cheap suit worn by undercover cops and rental car agents.
text: He sidles up alongside her as his PARTNER- a larger,
text: similarly dressed man- flanks Janice on her other side.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (busted)
dialog: Oh fuck--
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Sorry sir, this woman’s been
text: working the area for about a week.
text: The partner starts REMOVING JEWELRY FROM THE WOMAN’S POCKETS
text: and putting it on the glass counter. The Merchant is shocked.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look familiar? Yeah-
dialog: (to Partner)
dialog: Take her.
text: The partner whisks her off. Nicky grabs the Jade necklace
text: from the velvet tray.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're an expert- is this real?
text: The Merchant is surprised at what he sees.
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: That’s not mine.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No. This one is.
text: Nicky picks up the real Jade necklace fished from the woman’s
text: pocket. He takes command of the room with an authoritative
text: confident tone.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s her scam-- while she’s
dialog: holding this here, she’s got your
text: focus. More pointedly- her breasts
dialog: do. Meanwhile, down here, she’s
text: taking a fake out of her pocket and
text: leaving it on the velvet. She asks
text: to see another- and she pockets the
dialog: real one.
text: The Merchant is aghast.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Even I can tell this is from the
dialog: Dollar Bin at Target. But all she
text: needs is a sparkly hint of green in
dialog: your peripheral vision until she’s
text: out the door.
text: TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHES MEN enter with haste. One begins
text: SNAPPING PHOTOS while Nicky looks to the other.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Pat- we've got cameras here, here,
dialog: here and here.
dialog: (to Merchant)
dialog: We're going to need the
dialog: surveillance drives. Can someone
dialog: help him with that?
text: Addled, the merchant looks to a SALESWOMAN across the store.
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Yes. Anna?
text: He gestures to her and she escorts Pat into the back. Nicky
text: keeps up the intensity on the merchant.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Now look at me.
dialog: (he does)
dialog: Do I have your attention?
dialog: (he does)
dialog: Is this everything she touched? I
dialog: need you to be absolutely sure.
text: He nods compliantly.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything?
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Everything.
text: Nicky places a pile of EMPTY EVIDENCE BAGS on the counter.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I need you to place any items she
dialog: touched into these bags.
dialog: (he complies)
text: One bag per item. Each bag has a
dialog: number and each of those numbers
dialog: are on this claim form. Are you
dialog: paying attention?
text: He SLAPS A SET OF FORMS on the counter.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is your record. Please make
dialog: sure the numbers are correct. You
dialog: will receive two copies- one yellow-
dialog: one blue. The blue copy--
text: The man is checking the numbers intently.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you paying attention?
dialog: (nod)
dialog: The blue copy is your primary copy.
dialog: I suggest you put it somewhere
dialog: other than the yellow copy. But
dialog: only the blue copy can be used to
dialog: reclaim evidence. Are you paying
dialog: attention?
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Are the numbers correct?
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Uh-
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I thought you were paying
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: They seem fine, um, yes.
text: He THRUSTS A PEN in the Merchant’s face.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Good. I need you to sign here.
dialog: Initial here. Here and here.
dialog: Initial once more.
text: He TEARS OFF a blue copy and SLAPS it on the counter.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do not lose it.
text: He tears off the yellow copy as Pat re-emerges from the back
text: with a four hard drives in an evidence bag.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now my partner is coming back to
dialog: take a statement. It might be
dialog: helpful if you jot a few things
dialog: down while your memory’s still
dialog: fresh. Can you do that?
text: He nods as Nicky gathers up the evidence bags of jewelry.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: If you have any questions, this is
dialog: my card, okay?
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: We’re gonna get this done as soon
dialog: as possible. Promise.
dialog: (holds out his hand)
dialog: Pen.
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You stole my pen.
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Oh! Sorry.
text: The Merchant finds Nicky’s pen in his pocket, hands it back.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Thank you.
text: Nicky heads for the door. The Merchant watches, concerned.
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: Blue copy, right?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You were paying attention. Very
dialog: good.
text: And with a wide smile, Nicky’s gone.
text: The Merchant looks to the business card. It’s BLANK. He
text: turns it over. BLANK.
text: Confused, he picks up the blue form. What he sees concerns
text: him: A SMILING CARPET LOGO above a company name- “MISTER
text: STEAMY CARPET CLEANING.” He looks up.
text: The store is EMPTY- every DISPLAY CASE has been cleaned out.
text: Anna emerges from the back, not yet aware...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That policeman gave me a blank
dialog: card. Isn’t that funny?
text: And as the Merchant bolts for the door--
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: “FOCUS”
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - DUSK
text: High above the city in the cool blue gloam of twilight, Nicky
text: takes in the view from the BALCONY. He seems as distant as
text: the lights on the horizon, as he nibbles on a small package
text: of gummy bears.
text: He CRUMPLES the empty bag and returns to his room.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: Nicky waits for the elevator. He notices a MOTHER and her
text: SON approaching from down the hall. He watches them.
text: DING! The doors open. Nicky enters the elevator, presses the
text: lobby button. The mother rushes for the elevator.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Coming...
text: Nicky pays no mind and doesn’t register the woman's
text: astonished face as the doors SHUT on her just inches away.
speaker_heading: MOTHER (0.C.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Really?!
dialog: No reaction.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Nicky approaches a comely CONCIERGE. He turns on the charm.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Hi, how are you tonight?
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: I'm fine, thanks- how can I help
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Weren’t you working this morning?
dialog: You must be exhausted. I hope
dialog: they’re paying you enough.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: Well, no, but thank you for
dialog: noticing.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I know Elegio is reservation only,
dialog: but do they still accept walk-ins
dialog: at the bar?
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: Yes, but at eight it may not be
dialog: worth your time...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: That’s why I wanted to talk to you.
dialog: (smile)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Could you call them and tell them
dialog: Chef Julien Bardolejo of Las Losos
dialog: in Barcelona was hoping they’d save
dialog: a spot for him at the bar?
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: (smiles knowingly)
dialog: I suppose I could give it shot.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You have a wonderful night.
text: He finishes with a wide smile that satisfies her. It quickly
text: fades as he heads for the door- passing a group of TOURISTS
text: posing for a photo. One of them EXTENDS A CAMERA to him.
speaker_heading: TOURIST
dialog: Would you mind...?
text: He keeps walking, pretending not to hear.
scene_heading: INT. ELEGIO RISTORANTE - BAR - NIGHT
text: A high end hotel restaurant with a crowded bar- Nicky seated
text: prominently at the head of it, enjoying a glass of wine as a
text: WAITER places a PLATE of finely prepared food before him.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Gracias, sefor.
text: He cuts into his food, takes a bite.
text: ON THE KITCHEN DOOR: A CHEF and SOUS CHEF sneak looks at him,
text: awaiting a reaction to their food. Nicky reaches for the
text: SALT. The chef is crushed.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Dammit...
text: The sous chef tries to console him as he skulks off.
text: BACK ON NICKY: Looking around the bar, taking in the faces of
text: the strangers. Eventually, at the far end of the bar--
text: A beautiful young woman (JESS BARRETT) shoos off the advances
text: of a DRUNKEN STRANGER. We can’t hear, but reading her lips--
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I'm waiting for someone. He'll be
dialog: here any minute...
dialog: 10.
text: Nicky watches the drunk lean in close to her. She looks
text: around trying to ignore the clingy suitor, making brief eye
text: contact with Nicky. She SMIRKS at him as she gently PUSHES
text: the drunk away with a laugh.
text: Nicky smiles and returns to his food. He salts it again.
speaker_heading: CHEF (0.S.)
dialog: (distant, from kitchen)
speaker_heading: FUCK!
dialog: This amuses Nicky, until-
speaker_heading: JESS (0.S.)
dialog: Are you a serial killer?
text: CUT WIDE to reveal JESS is standing next to him.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No. Not anymore, at least.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Can you be my boyfriend for a
dialog: minute?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Sure. Waiting for someone?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Not really. No.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Join me for dinner?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Love to.
text: He turns to the bartender to order when she suddenly grabs
text: his plate and starts eating.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I was going to--
dialog: (then)
dialog: Never mind.
dialog: (to Bartender)
dialog: Uno mas por favor.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: This is really good.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It is.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Kinda salty though.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Didn’t notice...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I'm Jess.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Nicky.
text: They share a smile.
scene_heading: INT. ELEGIO RISTORANTE - BAR - LATER
text: Near closing time. The crowd has thinned. Jess and Nicky are
text: still at the bar, surrounded by half-empty wine glasses and a
text: mostly eaten dessert, clearly enjoying themselves.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What was this one again?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Montrachet.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Montrachet. And this one?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Gevrey Chambertin. Same region,
dialog: different grape.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Burgundy.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Very good.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Yaaaaay...
text: A mini high five as Jess beams. Even to a guarded man like
text: Nicky, she’s disarming and sexy without trying.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: So confusing. How’d you learn all
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Mostly by drinking. The more you
dialog: drink the more you learn...
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Well then that makes me the
dialog: foremost expert on Jaeger Bombs.
text: They laugh. The bartender gently places the BILL before
text: Nicky. The couple mourns it’s arrival.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: For the wine. Food is compliments
dialog: of the Chef.
text: Nicky nods politely and pulls out a huge roll of hundreds.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Does this mean it’s over? I still
dialog: have so much to learn.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I’m afraid so.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Sad. Well thanks for the rescue...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No problem, although I think your
text: nemesis has lost his sting.
text: He motions across the bar where the drunk guy has nodded off
text: with his head in his hand.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I walk you somewhere?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (pointing upstairs)
dialog: Actually I’m staying here.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: So, yes.
text: A look. A beat.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Nicky and Jess kiss passionately as they back up to the bed,
text: landing on it with her atop him.
text: After a deep, deep kiss Jess sits up with a smoldering look.
text: She starts to remove her top when--
dialog: 13.
text: SLAM! The door WHIPS OPEN to reveal a HUGE MAN with a GUN.
speaker_heading: HUGE MAN
dialog: I knew you were here, bitch!
text: Jess flies off of Nicky who sits up quickly.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: It’s my husband!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You're married!?
speaker_heading: HUGE MAN
dialog: Shut the fuck up!
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Jared wait!
text: Jared rushes toward Nicky and SLAM! PINS HIM AGAINST THE
text: HEADBOARD-- holding the gun to his mouth.
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: I’m gonna fucking kill you!
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: NO Jared! Let him go!
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: No fucking way! You’re dead.
dialog: (gets in his face)
dialog: Give me one fucking reason I
dialog: shouldn't do it?!
text: Nicky, strangely calm, thinks a moment.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I'm drawing a blank...
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I think you should do it. I mean
dialog: let's be honest. You’ve been
text: aggrieved.
text: Jared and Jess are stymied.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Don’t mess around with him Nicky-
dialog: he’s done hard time!
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (to Jared)
dialog: And frankly, if you had any idea
dialog: what I was planning to do to your
dialog: wife before you came in, you’d be
text: really aggrieved.
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: Shut up man!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Dirty stuff. Really dirty stuff.
dialog: Real Apehouse stuff.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Wait a second- what kind of stuff
dialog: are we talking about?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Tommy Lee kind of stuff. You should
dialog: definitely shoot.
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: Stop fucking around! I’1l do it!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You'd be doing me a huge favor.
dialog: Seriously- I’ve got a brain tumor
text: the size of a softball.
text: Jared is surprised to hear this.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: (conflicted)
dialog: Ah shit! You got cancer?
text: He backs away as Jess goes is suddenly defeated.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: He’s onto to us. Are you a pro?
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: Shit. I told you this wasn’t going
dialog: to work.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Just give us the money.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Or what?
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Or he’s gonna shoot you in the
dialog: neck.
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: I don’t want to shoot a guy with
dialog: cancer. Grandma Mikulski had
dialog: cancer...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: He doesn’t have cancer you idiot!
dialog: (to Nicky)
dialog: Just give us the money.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You guys really boned this. You’re
dialog: supposed to wait until she gets my
dialog: pants off so when you come in I
dialog: leave them behind when you tell me
dialog: to run. Then you got the cash and
dialog: I’m never coming back. Second-
dialog: whatever you heard- about how it’s
dialog: not a felony if there’s no bullets
dialog: in the gun? It’s crap. Deadly
dialog: weapon, loaded or not.
text: Jared and Jess completely drop their guard.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: When did you make us?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: When you lifted the drunk guy’s
dialog: wallet.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What? Bullshit.
text: Nicky reaches into her jacket on the bed, pulls out a man’s
text: wallet and tosses it to her.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Couldn’t have been more obvious...
text: She catches it, Nicky heads for the door.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: It was good lift!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Sure it was...
text: Nicky is gone, turns her frustration on Jared.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Why didn’t you wait!?
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: How was I supposed to know when you
dialog: had his pants off!?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: How many times did we go over this?
dialog: I say, “that’s the biggest one I’ve
dialog: ever seen” and then you come
text: through the door.
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: I did hear it! But now I’m thinking
text: it came from across the hall. What
dialog: are the chances!?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I should have never asked you to do
dialog: this!
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: Are you mad at me?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: Can I still be your trainer?
text: Jess cools slightly.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (deep exhale)
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: Are you still gonna come to my
dialog: Zamba class?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: ...Yeah.
scene_heading: EXT. NYC STREET - CHELSEA - NIGHT
text: Nicky makes his way through the chilly night back to his
text: hotel. He’s seems pretty unfazed by the goings on.
speaker_heading: JESS (0.S.)
dialog: That was not a shitty lift!
text: He stops, turns- Jess a few yards behind him and approaching.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: The drummer from Def Leopard could
dialog: take the poke off a drunk. You
dialog: think that makes you special?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: No. This does.
text: She pulls out a DIFFERENT WALLET. Nicky pauses. He pats his
text: breast pocket, it’s his. He’s impressed.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HIGH LINE - OPEN AIR CAFE - NIGHT
text: A romantic open air CAFE atop THE HIGH LINE. Nicky and Jess
text: have coffee at a cozy table. Nicky is mid story.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: ..-my Grandfather used to pay Union
dialog: Pacific twenty grand a year to let
dialog: him run a game on their trains. Not
dialog: to the conductor- the owner
dialog: himself. Cash in hand. Never had a
dialog: problem, until one day the game got
text: held up by a team out of Toledo.
dialog: But one of the players had a little
dialog: derringer- thinks its a good time
text: to defend himself- whips it out-
text: misses. Other guys start firing.
text: Grandpa catches a bullet in the
dialog: eye. Shouldn’t have happened.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Know who knocked over the game?
dialog: My dad.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: No. Did he know?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Of course. He raised my dad in it
dialog: just like my dad raised me in it.
dialog: You see an angle- you play it. He
dialog: didn’t mean for it to go down that
dialog: way- thought he’d impress him later
text: by splitting up the money with him.
dialog: At least that’s what I was raised
dialog: to believe.
dialog: (then)
dialog: He was only eighteen years old...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You do this long enough, you see
dialog: everyone as a player or as someone
dialog: to be played. It’s no life.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What’s your thing? Inside? Roper?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Everything- been in it so long.
dialog: Short grift, Big Store. Work the
dialog: whiz all over too. Cannon...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: That’s what I want to do.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No you don’t.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I want to learn it all. I want you
dialog: to show me.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Look-
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: No- I wasn’t born into this like
dialog: you. I was a dyslexic foster kid-
dialog: no prospects, no future. It’s a
dialog: minor miracle I’m not a hooker
dialog: right now. I was lucky enough to
dialog: have a boyfriend to show me how to
dialog: lift and I’ve done okay. I know I
dialog: have a lot to learn but its not
text: like mentors are falling off trees.
dialog: You’re my shot.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You want advice? Here- Stay off the
dialog: grift and stay away from the whiz
dialog: mobs. Because once you're in,
dialog: you're in. Stick to the pockets,
dialog: work alone. Save your money and one
dialog: day you get out and start a
dialog: business or something. Maybe you
dialog: fall in love or just have a life.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I can pay you. Just teach me.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I don’t do that.
dialog: 19.
text: A WAITER leans in and places the CHECK between them. Nicky
text: reaches for it, Jess stops him.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I got this.
text: The waiter EXITS, revealing Jess has PULLED THE WALLET FROM
text: THE WAITER’S POCKET WITH HER OTHER HAND.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m good. You know I’m good.
text: She pulls out some cash. Nicky smiles.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Not the point. Besides- I’m leaving
dialog: town tomorrow.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Detroit.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Now you're being a dick. No one
dialog: goes to Detroit.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: None of your business.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: At least teach me something.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I gotta go.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Just one thing? Can you show me
dialog: just one thing? Something new I
dialog: could use? Anything? Pleeease?
dialog: (off Nicky’s look)
dialog: I bought you coffee...
dialog: Nicky SIGHS.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH LINE - 23RD STREET LAWN - LATER
text: Nicky demonstrates for Jess. His COAT hangs on a sign and he
text: uses his wallet in the front lapel pocket as an example.
dialog: 20.

dialog: I’1ll teach you how to do a few
dialog: touches but that’s it. I’1l assume
dialog: you can flip a leather on it’s
dialog: feet, throw it over if you need to-
dialog: and pull...
text: Quickly and smoothly he positions the wallet without moving
text: the coat and eventually pulls it out. Something to see. He
text: tosses it in another pocket.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Breast pocket is harder but we know
dialog: you've got that down- at least if
dialog: the guy’s had 6 MacCallans...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Ha ha...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Sneaky is fine, but you can get
dialog: away with much more when you have
dialog: their attention.
text: He turns to her, taking control.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
text: Look him in the eye. Shake his hand
dialog: maybe-
text: He gives her a shake. Once he lets go, he raises his other
text: hand to show her a PAIR OF GLASSES.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you feel that?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (smirk)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: How about this?
text: He holds up her WATCH. She’s shocked.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You took that right off my wrist!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It’s about distraction. It’s about
text: focus. The brain is slow and it
dialog: can’t multitask. You touch him here-
dialog: do what you want here-
dialog: 21.
text: Nicky holds up a MEMBERSHIP CARD.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: You take Zumba?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: That’s not mine.
text: He continues with incredible agility and speed.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Tap him here, take from here. Look
dialog: over there, he follows. Take from
dialog: here...
text: He’s showing her things from her pockets without her even
text: realizing his other hand is pulling out OTHER THINGS. It’s a
text: slick, flirtatious ballet and she’s in the middle of it.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s on your head?
text: Her GLASSES are now on her head. She smirks. How could she
dialog: not feel that?
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you gonna slap me?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: If you knew where my hand was you'd
dialog: want to.
text: She looks down, but it’s too late- he’s already pulled her
text: iPhone out of her back pocket.
text: The show continues, becoming ever more seductive, until she
dialog: can’t take it anymore.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Okay okay okay... I get it.
text: Nicky takes a moment. He steps in close, stares in her eyes.
text: He gently raises her hand into frame...
text: ...and PLACES HER OWN RING BACK ON HER FINGER. She’s wetter
text: than a submarine with screen doors.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Now you've got something to
dialog: practice...

speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Why do I like this place?
speaker_heading: HORST

speaker_heading: HORST
dialog: Sub-junction. We can tie in to

speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: How many bathrooms? Fat Ass Farhad

speaker_heading: HORST

speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HORST

speaker_heading: NICKY

speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NICKY

dialog: going on down here. Every bar,
dialog: restaurant, hotel, wherever...
text: SHOT CONTINUES as a BEARDED MAN bumps into a FAN, quickly
text: apologizing. TILT DOWN as HE TAKES THE FAN’S WALLET.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
text: Guys working alone, working in

speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: You can skim the data off a credit

text: The credit card is returned to the wallet, passed off again
text: and within seconds-- the WALLET IS BACK IN THE FAN’S BACK
text: POCKET and he is none the wiser.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: .--and by the time the mark gets
dialog: wise, he’s back in Youngstown
text: arguing with his wife over the card
dialog: statement.
text: SHOT CONTINUES to REVEAL NICKY AND JESS at the bar-
text: surrounded by a GANG of ROWDY GUYS. Nicky is mid-bet with a
text: one of them, a BALD GUY.
text: Nicky refers to two SHOT GLASSES before him. ONE filled to

speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I’1l make the bourbon and the water
dialog: switch glasses without pouring them
dialog: into anything, including my mouth-
speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: No way. But hell- Fifty bucks? Why
dialog: the fuck not?
text: The other men start waving money around, wanting a piece of
text: the action. Jess COLLECTS it as:
text: Nicky grabs a COASTER, PUTS IT ON THE WATER FILLED SHOT GLASS-
text: turns it UPSIDE DOWN and puts it ON THE BOURBON GLASS.
text: He PULLS THE COASTER OUT SLIGHTLY to open up a little space
text: between the glasses and they all watch as PHYSICS TAKES OVER:
text: THE HEAVIER WATER FLOWS DOWN INTO THE BOURBON GLASS AND THE
text: LIGHTER BOURBON FLOATS UP INTO THE WATER GLASS. The men
text: explode in delighted disbelief.
speaker_heading: ROWDY GUYS

speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: IF YOU THINK I’M GONNA LET YOUR

text: FUCKING CRAZY!
text: THE ENTIRE LOBBY TURNS. Jess stands there perplexed and ready
text: to hit him. But as Nicky keeps YELLING--
text: QUICK CUTS all around the LOBBY as THIEVES DISGUISED AS
text: TOURISTS take advantage of the situation with amazing speed:
text: BY A GIFT SHOP: A passing thief SWAPS OUT a GUCCI SHOPPING
text: BAG at the feet of a rich woman, stealing hers.
text: ON THE REGISTRATION LINE: A “GUEST” places a FALSE BOTTOM
text: SUITCASE over someone else’s SMALLER SUITCASE and calmly

speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Did I miss something...?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - EARLIER THAT DAY

text: double deals, others shuffle cards with staggering dexterity.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: There’s card games everywhere and
dialog: they let anyone with enough cash
dialog: in. Chances are at least one of
dialog: those guys you don’t know is a
dialog: mechanic who can work a deck like
dialog: Jascha Heifetz doing Tedesco...
text: A CARD MECHANIC shaves down the side of a card deck with
text: sandpaper. A HUSTLER passes out STACKS OF CASH to the others.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: Guys will shave down the entire
dialog: deck except for the aces so they
text: can feel them when they shuffle and
dialog: pull them out when they need them.
text: ANOTHER CARD SHARP puts in a CONTACT LENS.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)

speaker_heading: CARD SHARP
dialog: I swear, I’ve never had a four of a

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: BUXOM WOMAN
dialog: No! Just run!
dialog: 31.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS the pants-less mark as he dodges the Bruiser
text: and runs out the door and into the HALL-- PASSING JESS AND

text: clearly inferring that that is how it’s done.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Married guys are the best- who are
dialog: they gonna tell?
text: A second woman SCREAMS from ANOTHER ROOM.
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE (0.S.)

text: running for the elevator as Jess and Nicky round the corner.
text: END MONTAGE as we CUT TO--
scene_heading: INT. NICKY’S CAR - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON NICKY, driving. CLOSE ON JESS next to him. Looking

speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD

speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD

speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD

scene_heading: EXT. BANK - NIGHT
text: A BUSINESSMAN gets cash from an ATM machine and exits. A

speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Wow. He made that?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Few years back he replaced the

speaker_heading: NICKY

speaker_heading: JESS

speaker_heading: JESS

speaker_heading: NICKY (0.C.)
dialog: You can count on me.
text: She slowly pushes through the bedroom door--
speaker_heading: JESS (0.C.)
dialog: Can I?
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: NICKY (0.C.)
dialog: Most would say no.
speaker_heading: JESS (0.C.)
dialog: I don’t know. You seem trustworthy.
speaker_heading: NICKY (0.C.)
dialog: That would be your first mistake.
speaker_heading: JESS (0.C.)
dialog: (laughs)
text: The bedroom is empty. Nicky is not in the room with her.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BUNGALOW BACKYARD - EARLIER THAT NIGHT
text: Romantic tension is palpable as they look at one another.
text: Nicky seems to second guess his impulses for a moment. She
text: picks up on it and lets him off easy.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Maybe I’1l just take a cab.
text: Nicky gives a gentle nod. She walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. SETAI HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Jess stands out on the BALCONY-- taking in the skyline of
dialog: Miami much the way Nicky did in New York.
text: Finally, a hard earned break.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: INT. MALL - DAY
text: OPEN ON 6 inch stiletto heels, shakily walking.
text: REVEAL JESS- dressed provocatively, squeezed into a tight
text: dress, her bustline boosted by cutlets.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Why do I have to do this Horst? I’m
dialog: gonna sprain an ankle or I’m gonna
dialog: sprain a boob- I’m not sure which.
text: CUT WIDER to reveal Jess, Horst, the Bearded Thief from the
text: bar (GARETH) as they walk through a crowded mall.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: HORST
dialog: Any man pickpocket would kill to
dialog: have your figure. No one looks at
dialog: your hands when you’ve got that
dialog: working for you.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I can’t breathe.
dialog: (adjusting cutlets)
dialog: It’s like being felt up by The
dialog: Incredible Hulk.
speaker_heading: HORST
dialog: First things first. We stick to
dialog: rich folks. And no one with a cane
dialog: or a wheelchair- it’s bad luck.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Gareth is the stall. All eyes on me
dialog: until I make the mark. Once I fan
text: him- I’1l tug my lapel. Two fingers
dialog: means the it’s a prat poke, three
dialog: fingers means the leather is an
dialog: insider. If it’s a cordeen or an
dialog: ox tongue I scratch my nose--
dialog: unless I use my thumb which means
text: I’m actually scrathing my nose.
dialog: Anything in the left tail or right
dialog: tail I’1l cock my head but nowadays
dialog: kiester kicks are 95 percent of it
dialog: so just do the touch and I ding the
dialog: poke in the nearest mailbox, okay?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (out of her depth)
dialog: Oh my God- what did you just say?
speaker_heading: HORST
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: Okay, plan B--
scene_heading: INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY
text: MUSIC as Nicky pulls into a parking garage, eventually
text: snagging a spot on Tangerine level.
scene_heading: INT. MALL — DAY
text: MUSIC CONTINUES as Nicky walks through the mall along the
text: UPPER LEVEL SHOPS.
text: He comes to a RAILING, looking down to the LEVEL BELOW.
dialog: 41.
text: Nicky sees Jess admiring a dress in a shop window.
text: Nearby, Horst is eyeing the crowd while perusing his
text: cellphone. He SNAPS a photo.
text: ON JESS-- she receives a TEXTED PHOTO OF A RICH WOMAN ON HER
text: PHONE. She spots the woman in the oncoming crowd. And as the
text: RICH WOMAN passes behind her, Jess FOLLOWS.
text: Nicky watches with great interest, starts WALKING, keeping
text: pace with the action below.
text: NICKY POV: Jess GAINS on the woman, drawing closer until--
text: Gareth ‘accidentally’ BUMPS THE WOMAN’S LEFT SHOULDER as he
text: passes from the other direction. At the same time--
text: -- JESS PASSES HER ON THE RIGHT, effortlessly DIPS HER HAND
text: INTO THE WOMAN’S PRADA BAG and pulls out a leather WALLET.
text: It’s over before the woman even turns to apologize to Gareth.
text: Nicky is intrigued. She’s a natural. He keeps her in his
text: sights as she moves. Whatever she’s doing, it’s not over.
text: NICKY POV: Jess “bumps into” a group of young men, suddenly
text: taking on the body language of an apologetic, klutzy girl.
text: Nicky watches as she uses this as a chance to FAN THE MEN’S
text: CLOTHING as they try to put the ‘klutzy’ Jess at ease.
text: They look to be GIVING HER DIRECTIONS, unaware as Jess DIPS
text: into one pocket, then ANOTHER.
text: ON NICKY: Smirking as she shakes a guy’s hand and TAKES HIS
text: WATCH like Nicky showed her. She’s graceful and deft.
text: Nicky tries to keep her in his view as she moves on and
text: passes Horst. Imperceptibly, she DUMPS THE GOODS WITH HIM AND
text: KEEPS GOING.
text: This ballet continues, as does Nicky’s fascination with her.
text: She's making it look easy but it’s anything but that. He’s
text: never seen anything like her before... he’s enamoured.
dialog: Maybe more.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUNGALOW BACKYARD - DAYS LATER - NIGHT
text: POP! Champagne corks fly as the team celebrates.
dialog: 42.
text: Horst, Farhad, Jess are amidst the crowd of crooks, helping
text: Nicky pour out champagne from a few magnum bottles.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: A record setting week, everybody.
dialog: As of three this morning- One
dialog: point two million.
text: Cheers from the crowd.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t forget to take your personal
dialog: belongings tonight- because by the
dialog: time the big game is over this
dialog: place will be bleached down and
dialog: repainted and everything not bolted
text: down is going in the incinerator.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Horst has your travel money.
dialog: Once
dialog: you're home, I’1l wire you all your
dialog: cut. Congratulations!
text: More cheers as they clink plastic glasses--
text: Farhad takes a swig and raises his glass
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: once again to Jess.
dialog: To the Rookie of the Year. Sorry if
dialog: I was a dick...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Wouldn't have it any other way
dialog: Farhad... you make me smile.
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: You're a cool chick Jess. I dig
dialog: your shit.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Thank you.
text: They clink glasses.
text: LATER THAT NIGHT, Jess mills through the
text: pleasantries with her new acquaintances.
text: She spots Nicky at the edge of the yard,
text: She heads over.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: party, exchanges
text: talking with Horst.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ACROSS THE YARD, Horst hands Nicky a BLACK DUFFLE BAG.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: That all of it? One point two?
speaker_heading: HORST
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Yeah. No ponies or dogs right?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: How long have you known me?
speaker_heading: HORST
dialog: That’s my point. See you when I see
dialog: you.
text: They exchange smiles. Horst EXITS, revealing a nearby Jess
dialog: who overheard everything.
text: Nicky is pleased to see her.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: There she is- I wanted to ask you
dialog: something...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Yeah me too. No big cons? I
dialog: thought you were all big time.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No big cons. It’s a volume
dialog: business. Not sexy, I know- but
dialog: it’s profitable, it’s safe and it
dialog: works. Hell, we may even offer
dialog: health care next year.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Kind of a gyp.
text: Nicky smiles at her forwardness.
speaker_heading: NICKY
text: Maybe on the next one, George Raft.
dialog: But I just made you fifty K-
dialog: where’s the gratitude?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I’m an ingrate, I admit it. But I’m
dialog: ambitious - most people find it
dialog: charming.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Very charming. But if I could steer
dialog: the conversation back to my opening
dialog: line. You feel like going to the
dialog: game tomorrow?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Super Bowl? Really? Like, just us?
text: Nicky offers an affirmative shrug.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah. That’d be great.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Good. Meet you there.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (sincere)
dialog: But, um, seriously- I want to thank
dialog: you for bringing me in on this.
dialog: Thanks for trusting me.
text: She extends her hand. He shakes.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No offense, but I never trusted
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: None taken. I assume you feel that
dialog: way about everybody.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I had a dog once, but yeah.
speaker_heading: JESS
text: Poor wounded bird lining his nest
dialog: with hundred dollar bills...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It’s a sob story, I admit it. I
dialog: feel sorry for myself.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Genius must be such a burden.
speaker_heading: NICKY
text: Crushing.
text: Jess smiles. Nicky too. A long pause. A kiss moment? Again
text: Nicky squelches it coolly.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: So, I’ll see you tomorrow.
text: She walks off, Nicky reaches into his breast pocket.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Wait- I forgot to give you your
dialog: ticket...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: No you didn’t.
text: She waves a SUPER BOWL TICKET over her shoulder as she exits
text: and he puts two and two together. He smirks, loving it,
text: dwelling on her exit.
text: PRELAP MUSIC as we CUT TO--
scene_heading: INT. SUN LIFE STADIUM - VARIOUS - DAY
text: SUPER BOWL. The air is electric, fans pour into the stadium.
text: At the turnstiles, Jess shows her ticket as she comes
text: through. A TICKET TAKER points her toward her destination.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Jess rises to the top of an ESCALATOR- checking her ticket
text: and looking for a sign to guide her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ON AN UPPER LEVEL, a confused Jess approaches an USHER. He
text: leads her to a set of FROSTED GLASS DOORS which SLIDE OPEN.
scene_heading: INT. STADIUM HALLWAY - DAY
text: The din of the crowd is muffled within the enclosed hallway.
text: Eventually her ticket leads her to a door marked “SKY BOX 18”
text: She checks her ticket to be sure, then OPENS THE DOOR to find-
scene_heading: INT. SKYBOX 18 - CONTINUOUS
text: The ROAR of the crowd fills her ears as she enters a LUXURY
text: BOX overlooking the game.
text: The crowd is almost exclusively ULTRA RICH CHINESE MEN AND
text: WOMEN, enjoying the buffet, the bar, and the company of a few
text: SUPERMODELS and CELEBRITIES.
text: Jess wanders in, convinced she’s in the wrong place until--
text: Nicky waves from the BALCONY, motions for her to come over.
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: INT. SKYBOX 18 - LATER
text: The game is in full swing as Nicky and Jess enjoy themselves
text: and watch from their prime seats on the balcony.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: How’d you get these tickets?
text: He points out seven foot six YAO MING inside the suite. They
text: share a wave.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Yao Ming’s a friend.
text: Jess and Nicky turn their attention back to the field.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Is this a bad time to mention I
dialog: don’t really like football? I mean
dialog: it just seems like a lot of
dialog: standing around all the time...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Lots of standing, with brief
text: moments of head trauma.
text: An awkward beat, he looks to the crowd.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, if you don’t like football we
dialog: can still make it fun...
dialog: (sees something)
dialog: Okay, look-
text: He points to the STANDS BELOW where a VENDOR is preparing to
text: toss a HOT DOG to a FAN eight seats down the row.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Dollar says that guy misses the
dialog: catch.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (smiling, game )
dialog: Let’s make it a sawbuck.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Done.
text: THEIR POV: The Vendor THROWS. The fan MISSES the hot dog.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: AH!! How’d you know?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: That guy can’t throw.
text: A ROAR as the crowd starts to DO THE WAVE on the other side
dialog: of the stadium.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (searching the crowd)
dialog: Okay- there- shirtless guy with
text: the body paint. Sawbuck says he’s
text: too drunk to get up for the wave.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You sure? His team is on a drive.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You in or out?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: In.
text: The WAVE COMES AROUND- the man does not get up.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Yessss!! I know my drunks.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Nice.
text: They're having fun. Nicky spots another opportunity.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay- there- the mamacita in the
dialog: short shorts...
text: In the stands below, a shapely CUBANA is making her way from
text: her seat down the row TOWARD THE AISLE.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: How many guys will check her out on
dialog: the way up the aisle? Closest
text: without going over wins.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: End seats only? At least ten.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: There’s a play on. I say three.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Six.
text: They turn to see a CHINESE INDUSTRIALIST sitting nearby.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: INDUSTRIALIST
dialog: Can I get in on this?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Sure. Ten bucks- Mister...?
speaker_heading: INDUSTRIALIST
dialog: Liyuan. I say six guys look. Sure
dialog: thing.
text: They nod in agreement and turn their attention to the
text: Mamacita as she steps onto the aisle. The FIRST GUY she
text: passes checks out her shorts.
speaker_heading: JESS (0.S.)
dialog: That’s one.
text: THEIR POV: A SECOND GUY looks. Then a THIRD. Then a FOURTH.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Damn...
text: A FIFTH, A SIXTH. She climbs to the last step, exiting-
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: It’s six!
text: But at the last second a SEVENTH MAN turns and rubbernecks.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: SEVEN! Yes!
dialog: (to Liyuan)
dialog: You’re over! Whooo! I know my
dialog: letches too!! Money money money!
text: She holds out her hand and Mr. Liyuan pays with a smile.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: (playful)
dialog: I want justice! I want my money
dialog: back! Make another bet.
speaker_heading: NICKY / JESS
dialog: Sure... okay...
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Which team draws the next foul?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Offense.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Uh- I don’t know football... you
dialog: boys play.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: (to Nicky)
dialog: Okay, defense. A thousand dollars?
text: A moment. Unexpected, but Nicky is game.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ON THE FIELD: The play begins. In moments WHISTLES are blown,
text: a YELLOW FLAG FLIES.
text: The LEAD OFFICIAL announces the penalty.
speaker_heading: LEAD OFFICIAL
dialog: Holding! Number 25. Offense. Five
dialog: yards, second down!
text: Liyuan loses, but takes it in stride. Jess is excited.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Whoa!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Wooo!
text: Liyuan peels off 2000 DOLLARS from a big roll.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: No way that was a hold. Double or
dialog: nothing they make the first down.
text: Nicky thinks a beat. He seems to be fighting an urge. He
text: stretches his neck, then...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Okay...
text: ON THE FIELD- The SNAP... the THROW... the CATCH... the
text: TACKLE... FIRST DOWN!
text: ON LIYUAN, cringing with another loss. Nicky reaches for the
text: cash. lLiyuan STOPS HIM, more MONEY in hand.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Five thousand. Do they pass or run?
text: Jess tries to make eye contact with Nicky but in the grips of
text: his affliction he ignores her.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Call it.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: They run.
text: ON THE FIELD: The SNAP, the BLITZ, the QB cocks his arm back-
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (hopeful)
dialog: Oh!
text: BACK ON THE QB: He sees an alley and RUNS. Liyuan WINS.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Yeah!!!
text: Nicky smiles, beaten.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Ouch...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Okay, I’ve learned my lesson.
dialog: (to waitress)
dialog: Can I get a beer?
text: Liyuan is charged up.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: I give you double or nothing. Your
dialog: bet.
text: Nicky takes a deep breath, thinking. As he exhales...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Nah...
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Easy bet, easy bet. They make this
dialog: kick, you win. Good odds right?
dialog: They always make the kick. You
dialog: can’t lose.
text: Nicky considers it. Jess grows uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN (CONT'D)
dialog: C’mon- I like to play. I like you.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Fine. So what’s that?
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Ten thousand.
text: Nicky heaves a breath.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Too much?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I got it. You?
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: I always play big.
text: He points to his BODYGUARD who holds a BRIEFCASE.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Ten thousand they make it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ON THE FIELD: The SNAP, the KICK... DEFLECTED!
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
text: JESS CRINGES at Nicky’s loss. Liyuan GROANS in faux sympathy.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Oh no... sorry... I’m a lucky guy.
text: Nicky looks a little shaken. Jess is concerned.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Maybe we should g-
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Fifty thousand.
text: Heads turn. Nicky has fire in his eyes.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
text: Fifty thousand they down the punt.
dialog: No return.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Ahhh. Now you make things
dialog: interesting.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Okay.
text: ON THE FIELD-- The PUNT flies down the field...
text: ON NICKY, JESS and LIYUAN-- Nerves fraying.
text: ON THE BALL as it descends into the arms of a RECEIVER and...
speaker_heading: HE RUNS.
dialog: 52.
text: ON NICKY, deflating, fifty grand lighter. Jess is sick to
text: her stomach. Liyuan is thrilled.
dialog: And before Jess can console Nicky--
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (defiant)
dialog: A hundred thousand!
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Whoa!
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Hundred thousand? You don’t have a
dialog: hundred thousand...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Sure I do.
text: Nicky reaches under his seat, pulls up THE BLACK DUFFLE BAG
text: HORST GAVE HIM and pulls out TEN BANDED STACKS OF HUNDREDS.
text: Jess recognizes the bag.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You can’t do that.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It’s fine.
dialog: (to Liyuan)
dialog: How about you?
text: Liyuan’s bodyguard pops open the BRIEFCASE next to Liyuan.
text: It’s full of banded stacks of cash. Nicky nods.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Next pass - incomplete.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: (satisfied)
dialog: I say he catches it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ON THE FIELD: The SNAP... The BLITZ... The THROW.
text: ...the CATCH. Nicky loses again.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
text: ON NICKY-- Shaken, absorbing the loss. The room goes eerily
text: QUIET except for the Rolling Stones’ SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL,
text: playing on the suite’s sound system.
dialog: 53.
text: Liyuan smiles. Nicky might be in shock. Jess grabs him.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: We're going.
text: She leads him to the door. Nicky looks like he’s
text: asphyxiating. The walls are closing in on him.
text: Jess reaches for the handle. And as the door opens, NICKY
text: TURNS, marches back and--
text: SPILLS THE WHOLE BAGFUL OF CASH ON A POKER TABLE in the
text: middle of the suite.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: All of it.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Nicky!
dialog: Liyuan comes forward. Interested. It’s a lot of cash.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: (sotto, pissed)
dialog: That’s my money too.
text: Nicky ignores her and grabs a nearby DECK of cards.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Million one. High card takes it.
text: Liyuan is on the spot. He’s uncomfortable for a beat. Then
text: he blurts out a LAUGH--
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: You're crazy! I like it!
text: He motions to his bodyguard to bring more cash.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You first.
text: Liyuan steps up to the table, takes a breath. He reaches for
text: the deck, holds his hand on it- WAITING FOR HIS MOMENT. Then--
text: He CUTS the deck to show THE FIVE OF CLUBS.
text: The guests voice Liuyan’s disappointment with a COLLECTIVE
text: ‘OOOH...’ Liyuan’s face falls. His first vulnerable moment.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: (in mandarin)
dialog: Ah fuck...
dialog: 54.
text: Jess GASPS, semi relieved.
text: NICKY’S TURN. He puts his hand on the deck, staring down
text: Liyuan with an intense predatory stare.
text: Nicky smiles. He looks down. He CUTS and turns over...
text: THE THREE OF HEARTS. Nicky loses.
text: The world goes swimmy. Nicky’s suddenly a fly in Vaseline.
text: Jess's knees BUCKLE and she thuds into the sofa behind her.
text: LARGE CHINESE BODYGUARDS close in around Liyuan and the cash.
text: A walleyed Nicky watches helplessly until suddenly--
text: -he snaps out of it and hastily heads for the door, full of
text: sober self hatred. As he passes Jess-—
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Let’s go. It’s over.
text: He doesn’t even wait for her as marches out. She can’t speak.
text: A bodyguard OPENS THE DOOR wide as Nicky approaches. Then,
text: as he crosses the threshold--
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Sorry friend- that’s what happens
dialog: when you play with the big boys.
text: Nicky stops short. Things slow way down again. He burns.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (off Nicky’s expression)
dialog: Oh fuck me...
text: Nicky turns.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Give me double or nothing.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Oh man dude- what are you doing?
dialog: Just go home.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Double or nothing. I’1l make it
dialog: worth your while.
text: Liyuan is a bit surprised. He thinks about it and--
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: No, I don’t think so. You got a
dialog: problem my friend.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Take those binoculars. I'1l stay
dialog: here. Pick any player on or off the
dialog: field- any one at all. And I’1l
dialog: guess who it is.
text: Jess is aghast.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Any player? That’s 60 to one.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: 2 mill- I’m good for it.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: That's fucking crazy.
dialog: (bothered)
dialog: I don’t like it...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Fine. Pick any player on the field.
text: He points to JESS.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: .--and she’1l point him out.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (agog)
dialog: What!? No-
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: (wowed)
dialog: You're fucking crazy!
dialog: (thinks about it, then)
dialog: But I can’t turn down free money.
text: All are abuzz as Liyuan grabs the binoculars and heads for
dialog: the balcony.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What are you doing?! Don’t drag me
dialog: into this? Its not enough you lost
dialog: everyone’s money. My money?!
text: Nicky puts a hand on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Calm down.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Get your hands off me! You’re sick!
speaker_heading: LIYUAN (0.S.)
dialog: She reminds me of my wife...
text: Nicky tunes her out, turns his attention to Liyuan.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It’s a big bet Liuyan. Take your
dialog: time.
text: Liyuan scans the field. He settles on something. A smile.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: Got one. Want me to write it down?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I trust you.
dialog: (re: Jess)
text: Now it’s her turn.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I’m not doing this.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Just pick.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: He’s crazy, I know. But it will be
dialog: his fault, not yours.
text: With a deep breath, she reluctantly agrees. She joins Liyuan
text: by the balcony and takes the binoculars.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: JESS POV: She pans over the field pausing on various players.
text: ON JESS, the pressure is killing her.
text: ON NICKY, calm but concerned.
text: JESS POV: More scanning of the field, the sidelines...
text: ON JESS, clueless.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Uhhhbh...
text: ON LIYUAN, amused.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell am I supposed to do?
text: Liyuan turns to Nicky.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: I give you a chance to back out
dialog: okay? No hard feelings.
text: Nicky just shakes his head. Tension mounting.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Oh god... I don’t know...
text: JESS POV: She pauses on Player #30 on the sidelines, moves
text: on a few to the right, then back to #30.
speaker_heading: ON JESS:
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Well I guess number... wait--
text: She sees something, she pans back to the right.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: JESS POV: There, on the sidelines, an INCREDIBLY LARGE
text: LINEMAN catches her eye. She readjusts her view...

text: COACH on the sidelines.
text: JESS takes her eyes away from the binoculars, swallowing her
text: surprise. Nicky sees this from across the room, smiles.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Number fifty five.
text: ON LIYUAN. All eyes are on him. He slowly shakes his head. Is
dialog: it a no? Or---
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: I don’t believe it...
dialog: (blown away)
dialog: FUCK! That is unbelievable!!!
text: GASPS from the guests as they grapple with the upset. Jess
text: instinctively jumps into character.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (innocent)
dialog: I'm right?! Oh my God! I’m right?!
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: (wowed disbelief)
dialog: Yes!! You're fucking right!
dialog: Fucking shit!! You’re fucking
dialog: right!!! Crazy!!!
text: Nicky starts collecting the cash and the briefcase.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You’re not mad?
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: (crazed delight)
dialog: Fuck no! We have to go to Vegas
dialog: right now!!! I have a jet!!! That
dialog: was incredible!!
text: Liyuan turns to anyone who will listen as
speaker_heading: LIYUAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you see that!? Did you see what
dialog: she did!??
text: Jess slips over to Nicky as he finishes packing up the money--
speaker_heading: LIYUAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And you dude! You have big fucking
dialog: balls! You are my new fucking hero!
text: Nicky smiles wide. Then--
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Double or nothing?
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: (crazed delight)
dialog: No fucking way!!! Get the fuck out
dialog: of my suite!!!
text: And as they all LAUGH and make their exit--
scene_heading: INT. STADIUM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: ON THE SIDELINES, Farhad is talking to a COACH. We see now IT
text: IS THE MAN WHO LOST THE POKER HAND IN THE CROOKED HOTEL GAME.
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: I think I’m good coach. Consider
dialog: your debt settled.
text: Farhad grabs a Gatorade and walks off the field.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Nicky and Jess walk with hastened pace to a waiting LIMO.
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS
text: Nicky can finally relax as they drive off and Jess can no
dialog: longer contain herself.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I’m going to kill you!!!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You did great.
text: She SWATS him repeatedly and excitedly.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: How did you do that?!!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Liyuan is a legendary gambler.
dialog: Bets on everything. Anything. Huge
dialog: cash bets all the time. Once- the
dialog: Bellagio kicked Bill Gates out of
dialog: the High Roller Suite because they
dialog: heard Liyuan was flying in. He’s
dialog: the perfect vic.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: But how did you know who he was
dialog: gonna pick!?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Because we told him to. We’ve been
dialog: telling him all day long...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FIVE STAR HOTEL CORRIDOR - EARLIER THAT DAY
scene_heading: BEGIN FLASHBACK SEQUENCE of earlier that day--
text: Liyuan exits his suite with bodyguards, enters the ELEVATOR.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: From the moment he left his room
dialog: this morning we've been priming him-
text: programming his subconscious. He’s
dialog: been seeing the number fifty five
dialog: all day long...
dialog: 60.
text: IN THE ELEVATOR, an large ADVERTISEMENT for a WINE BAR in the
text: hotel named “55 Degrees”. Liyuan pays it little mind.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
text: On the elevator, in the lobby...
text: IN THE LOBBY, Liyuan is briefly CUT OFF by a group of FANS
dialog: (actually GARETH and some others we recognize from the con-
text: team). They are all WEARING #55 JERSEYS.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: ...even the stickpin on the
dialog: Doorman.
text: AS HE EXITS, Liyuan is greeted by HORST, dressed as a
text: DOORMAN. PUSH IN ON HIS LAPEL to see a #55 STICK PIN.
scene_heading: I/E. LIMO AND MIAMI STREETS - DAY
text: Liyuan rides in a limo, occasionally glancing out the window.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: .+-Not only that, we loaded his
dialog: route from the hotel to the
text: stadium. He looks out the window,
text: primers are everywhere.
text: VARIOUS CUTS- seemingly EVERYDAY EVENTS outside the limo are
text: given a CLOSER LOOK.
text: Undercover ACCOMPLICES are everywhere: As PEDESTRIANS in
text: JERSEYS, as PROTESTERS wearing matching color TEES with 55 on
text: their SIGNS, BILLBOARDS featuring FARHAD, etc...
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
text: ..-He doesn’t see it, but he does.
dialog: Team colors, fifty fives, even
dialog: Farhad...
text: AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT: HONKING gets Liyuan’s attention. He
text: turns to see FARHAD DRIVING A TAXI- honking and yelling.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: Suggestions are everywhere- the
dialog: number of flowers in a vase, the
dialog: tramp stamp on the hooker we sent
dialog: to his room last night.
text: FLASH CUT TO A NAKED WOMAN’S LOWER BACK as Liyuan fucks her
text: from behind. The number 55 is disguised as a TRIBAL TATTOO.
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: INT. SKYBOX 18 - EARLIER THAT DAY
text: An ACCOMPLICE replaces the iPod in the suite’s iPod DOCK and
scene_heading: PRESSES PLAY.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
text: It’s also what he hears- from the
dialog: words I choose, to the music in his
dialog: suite.
text: FLASHBACK of Nicky challenging Liyuan to the big bet as
text: SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL plays on the iPod DOCK.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: The Mandarin word for five is
text: ‘woo’. There are 124 woo-woos in
dialog: ‘Sympathy For the Devil’...
text: FLASHBACK ON LIYUAN looking through the binoculars, scanning
text: the field and eventually spotting Farhad.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
text: He doesn’t register it, but its all
text: there. And when he looks through
text: those binoculars and he spots the
dialog: biggest guy on the field he’s ever
dialog: seen in his life with the number
dialog: fifty five on his Jersey? Some
text: little voice deep in the back of
dialog: his head says, “That’s it”. He
text: thinks it’s intuition and picks.
text: A sly smile on Liyuan’s face. Then, as we've already seen--
speaker_heading: LIYUAN
dialog: I got one. Want me to write it
dialog: down?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I trust you.
dialog: (re: Jess)
text: Now it’s her turn.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I’m not doing this!
text: And as the scene plays on-
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: And you being in the dark and
text: flopping around like a trout ina
dialog: creel made it even more believable.
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - DAY
text: BACK IN THE PRESENT, Jess’ excitement is unabated.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: You are such an asshole!!
text: He laughs as she continues to swat at him.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s no way that can really
dialog: work!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Quick- what continent is Kenya on?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Africa.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: What are the colors of a chess
dialog: board?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Black and white?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Name an animal.
speaker_heading: JESS NICKY
dialog: Zebra. Zebra.
text: Jess is amazed.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: 85 percent of the time people say
text: zebra. The human brain. Hackable.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: So you had an 85 percent chance?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Farhad had it at about 59%. Better
dialog: odds than Vegas.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What if he picked wrong?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Just double down again until it
dialog: happens. It’s probabilistic.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Well you're still an asshole.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You wanted to learn- welcome to the
dialog: grift.
text: She swats him again. He fights back a little as things become
text: more playful.
text: He gets a hold of her arms, neutralizing her attack until--
text: She darts forward, KISSING HIM HARD. He quickly reciprocates.
text: It’s a long kiss, but they break for air eventually- staring
text: at one another for an extended beat-- heaving breaths, eyes
text: speaking unheard doubts and desires. Then--
text: They resume- passionately and intensely. The chemistry is
text: undeniable, it’s real. It’s intimate. It’s building.
text: They manage the occasional comment between kisses.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve wanted this a long time.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What the hell were you waiting for?
text: They’re consumed by one another instantly. Hands greedily
text: fumbling with clothing.
text: He reaches sensually into her hair and pulls her away from
text: him for a brief moment- admiring her.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Didn't know if I could trust you...
text: He leans in, she holds him back for a beat.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: And now...?
text: It burns in his eyes. He pulls her into a passionate kiss.
scene_heading: INT. SETAI HOTEL - JESS’ SUITE - NIGHT
text: Their two bodies lie still, facing one another, intertwined
text: in the sheets of Jess’ suite.
text: We move in slowly, closing in on Jess’ sleeping face.
text: CAMERA ARCS AROUND to reveal Nicky, awake and gazing at her.
dialog: 64.
text: Jess stirs. Her sleepy eyes opening for a moment to find him
text: there. A small smile, then-
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Go to sleep...
text: She reaches to pull him closer--
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You go to sleep...
text: She gives him a little kiss. She sleepily prods him--
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Such a jerk... made me look like an
dialog: idiot...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Next time you’1ll be in on it.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Promise?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Promise.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Next time, you’re the idiot...
text: She smiles. He gives her a kiss and she drifts back to sleep.
text: Nicky reflects pleasantly. But soon his expression changes.
dialog: There’s concern. Conflict.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: INT. SETAI HOTEL - JESS’ SUITE - MORNING
text: OPEN WIDE as sunlight floods the room, eventually REVEALING
text: Jess in the bed, alone.
text: She wakes, notices immediately he’s gone.
text: Rising slightly, she looks around with concern, but the
text: SOUNDS of milling about in the adjoining room of her suite
text: soothe her concerns.
text: She slips into a robe and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Jess shuffles into the living room with a smile to find a
text: HOUSEKEEPER, not Nicky. Both are surprised.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Oh...
text: Jess turns back as the Housekeeper apologizes in SPANISH, re-
text: entering her bedroom to find--
text: A FEW STACKS OF CASH on the dresser. Her cut.
dialog: A note. “Goodbye”
text: Pain wells in her eyes.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: OVER BLACK
text: “THREE YEARS LATER”
text: The searing WHINE of a 19000 RPM ENGINE and the gut pounding
text: RUMBLE of exhaust builds on the soundtrack until--
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AUTODROMO BUENOS AIRES - DAY
text: A FORMULA ONE CAR screams around the track on a test run at
dialog: the famous racing complex.
text: It zooms past the near empty stands, where a daytime COCKTAIL
text: PARTY is in progress. A few of the fabulous crowd take notice
text: and CHEER, perched over the railing.
text: BACK ON THE CAR, circling the track, passing--
text: IN THE PIT other cars IDLE or are in various states of
text: maintenance. Members of RACING TEAM GARRIGA diligently work
text: their various jobs as their driver gets a feel for the track.
text: IN THE STANDS sits Spanish team owner RAFAEL LAMARCA GARCES
text: GARRIGA-- 40, wildly wealthy and even more powerful. It oozes
text: out of every pore.
text: He sits alone, sipping on an espresso and surveying his team
dialog: from on high.
text: GARRIGA POV: Through the bustle trackside we find NICKY
text: talking to a rather severe and ominous 60 year old WELSHMAN--
text: Garriga’s head of security, WILLIAM OWENS.
text: They huddle around a bank of monitoring equipment and Nicky
text: points out the readings on several LCD screens.
dialog: 66.
text: Owens offers no emotion as he listens. Eventually, he steps
text: away-- headed for the stands.
text: Garriga takes another sip of his espresso, never taking his
text: eyes off the track until--
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: I wasn’t expecting such a kind
dialog: face...
text: Owens is next to him now. He speaks in a thick WELSH BROGUE.
speaker_heading: OWENS
text: The tech says his gizmo checks out.
dialog: But in complete candor I don’t like
dialog: this-- and I don’t like this boy.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: He’s a con man, sir.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: That’s the point.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: I've dealt with guys like him when
dialog: I was at 85 Albert. Slippery fish.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: I did not say you had to trust him.
dialog: Just to be sure he does his job.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: That I will. My eyes are open and I
dialog: keep my 1911 well fed.
text: Garriga is amused.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Invite him to lunch.
text: Owens nods even though Garriga has never removed his eyes
text: from the track.
scene_heading: EXT. RACETRACK LOUNGE - DAY
text: Before the huge windows in the empty dining area overlooking
text: the track, Garriga, Owens and Nicky have lunch.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: You are a man known for great
dialog: skills of persuasion and deception.
text: Nicky nods gently.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA (CONT'D)
dialog: You were very hard for me to find.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I'd been out of it for a while.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: So why did you take my offer?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Ran out of money.
text: Garriga smiles. He’s disarmingly charming.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: I love everything about what we do.
dialog: Drivers risk their lives for glory.
dialog: The competition, the constant
dialog: innovation, new materials, exotic
dialog: fabrication- all of it to gain a
dialog: fraction of a second on your
dialog: competition. It is a sport of
dialog: nanoseconds. Millions of dollars
dialog: to get the slightest edge.
dialog: (then)
dialog: My car- You saw it?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Beautiful...
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Easily $400 million dollars in R
dialog: and D. Ferrari, McEwen, Lotus, they
dialog: spend half of that.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But still I have a problem. Ten
dialog: years ago at LeMans I was young and
dialog: I was drunk and I declared Team
dialog: Garriga would dominate the sport
dialog: within a decade. And over that
dialog: decade we have come very close.
dialog: This year McEwen is the only team
dialog: standing in my way.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But I have something none of them
dialog: have.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: NICKY
text: The EXR. The fuel burn algorithm.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Yes, they all want it. My engineers
dialog: promise it guarantees me a win. But
dialog: that’s not enough for me. Perhaps I
dialog: am paranoid. Or perhaps I am too
dialog: proud. But I will not lose. That is
dialog: why I wanted you.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: This needs to be discreet. It needs
dialog: to be safe. No holes.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: The plan is as we’ve discussed. I
text: pose as a disgruntled contractor
dialog: offering to sell the EXR to the
dialog: McEwen Team. But that’s not what
dialog: I'll give them. I’11l give them a
dialog: fake designed by a friend of mine.
text: They’1l load it into their car's
dialog: tuning control unit. It will test
text: well- but it doesn’t do anything.
dialog: Basically it just gives a false
text: reading to their instruments. It’1ll
dialog: mislead the driver enough to give
dialog: you an added edge.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: How much of an edge?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Not much. Two thirds of a second
dialog: every few laps? Imperceptible.
dialog: Undetectable.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Two thirds of a second is a
dialog: gracious plenty.
text: Owens nods. Then-
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Just because the techs say it
dialog: checks out, what makes you think
dialog: you can convince them you're
dialog: absolutely real? That you’re
dialog: completely authentic? You can’t be
text: dicking around boy.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You don’t need to worry about that.
dialog: I’m well researched. We’re good to
dialog: go.
dialog: (then)
dialog: The Grand Prix Kickoff party at our
dialog: hotel tonight...
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I’ll be there early. I’1l be seen
text: drinking, bragging and boisterous.
dialog: At some point in the evening I'll
dialog: approach you in view of the McEwen
text: team. An argument ensues. I’1l
dialog: throw down my drink, I'll yell,
dialog: I‘1l shove you- Security will throw
dialog: me out. At that point it’1ll have
text: it’s own inertia. McEwen’11
dialog: probably contact me right there. If
dialog: not, I’1l go to him.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Just so we understand. Whatever I
dialog: sell it for- I keep all of it. Plus
dialog: the million from you.
text: Owens and Garriga agree.
scene_heading: EXT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Nestled into the beautiful city of Buenos Aires, a gorgeous
text: hip hotel plays host to a kickoff party of Grand Prix week.
text: Outside is a lavish affair where the race teams, dignitaries,
text: VIP spectators and generally fabulous folks enjoy themselves
text: as music thumps over it all.
text: Nicky arrives, working his way through the crowd. He passes
text: a RACE FAN COUPLE getting an autograph from a FAMOUS DRIVER.
text: The HUSBAND offers his camera to passing Nicky.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: Take our picture?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 70.
text: Nicky gladly grabs the camera and quickly pops off a photo of
text: the couple and the driver.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: One for safety...
text: He snaps another and returns the camera. Moving on, he spots
text: GARRIGA AND OWENS in a distant corner, regards them a moment,
text: then turns his gaze to ANOTHER SET OF VIP’S.
scene_heading: NICKY POV: A burly, ebullient AUSTRALIAN TEAM OWNER (MORGAN
text: MCEWEN, 50’s) hugs his DRIVER who wears a TEAM MCEWEN JACKET.
text: Nicky turns his attention to the BAR. He’s greeted by an
text: Argentine BARTENDER whose name tag reads, “MARCELLO”.
speaker_heading: MARCELLO
speaker_heading: (in SPANISH)
dialog: What may I get you sir?
speaker_heading: NICKY
speaker_heading: (in SPANISH)
dialog: Marcello, is it? I have a favor to
dialog: ask.
speaker_heading: MARCELLO
dialog: Yes sir?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I'm here on business with a client
dialog: who loves to drink. But I'ma
dialog: recovering alcoholic so when I
dialog: order a Vodka martini rocks can you
dialog: just give me water and olives
dialog: instead?
speaker_heading: MARCELLO
dialog: (in English)
dialog: Of course sir. Understood.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Vodka Martini. Rocks.
text: Marcello nods and prepares a drink.
scene_heading: EXT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: MUSIC as Nicky MINGLES at the party, talking to various
text: guests- LAUGHING, CHATTING and most of all, DRINKING.
text: ON NICKY, talking up a guest, “tipsy” and disparaging.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: -.-he’s a real son of a bitch as
dialog: far as I’m concerned. Do you know
dialog: if Garriga is Spanish for thief?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Forget it. I don’t want to ruin the
dialog: party... sorry man...
text: In a BRIEF MONTAGE, we watch him grow increasingly “drunk” as
text: he downs several water Martinis.
text: He LAUGHS loudly and sloppily FLIRTS with a pretty woman-
text: briefly catching MCEWEN’S eye- just enough to make an
dialog: impression.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: (pointing across room)
text: There he is right there. Commander
dialog: in Thief. Stole my designs. Could
dialog: have been millions in it for me.
dialog: Guess you can do whatever you want
dialog: if you're a rich prick...
speaker_heading: PRETTY WOMAN
dialog: Maybe you should slow down a
dialog: little. Drink some water...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No. I’m gonna talk to him. Its a
dialog: free country.
speaker_heading: PRETTY WOMAN
dialog: Just calm down.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I’m going...
text: He staggers off.
text: ON NICKY, heading across the room to Owens and Garriga.
text: Owens gives a subtle nod. Nicky acknowledges him.
text: But as he makes his way across to Garriga, he STOPS suddenly--
text: falling out of character. His face falls.
text: IT’S JESS, looking stunning in a gorgeous dress and making an
text: INCREDIBLE ENTRANCE from across the crowded space.
text: Confident on her heels, confident in all ways, she saunters
text: toward him with smoldering intensity. She seems a completely
text: different woman, but it’s definitely her.
text: Nicky is thrown for a loop as she comes closer. She doesn’t
text: see him but continues on, smiling at the sight of someone.
dialog: 72.
text: Nicky turns to see who, only to find GARRIGA spreading his
text: arms at the sight of her.
text: She walks right into Garriga’s arms and gives him a more-than-
dialog: a-friend kiss.
text: Nicky tries to absorb this shocking development. Shaken, he
text: veers off course and heads for an EXIT.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ON JESS, with Garriga, taking a sip from his drink.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Is this a Pisco Sour? I’1l have one
dialog: of these sweetie.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Of course bonita...
text: And as Garriga orders a drink from a nearby WAITER, Jess
text: catches sight of Nicky leaving the party. She calmly
text: observes him and after a few moments leans close to Garriga.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I’m just gonna run to the ladies...
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Of course...
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL TERRACE - NIGHT
text: Away from the party on a large terrace, Nicky looks out at
text: the beautiful grounds as he tries to process things.
text: After a few beats, the sound of women’s HEELS. He turns to
text: see Jess approaching. They silently size each other up.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Well hello.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Just here for the race.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Should be a good one.
dialog: (then, changing subject)
dialog: Long time.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (then, changing subject)
dialog: So you're with um...?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Rafael Garriga. Yes. He owns one of
dialog: the teams.
text: Nicky pauses. Acknowledgment or a pang of jealousy?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Oh. Great. Is he a mark?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: No. We’re together. Have been for a
dialog: long time. I’m out of the game.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Oh. Good. Good for you.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I--
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I looked for you, you know.
text: Guilt plays behind his eyes.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You shouldn’t have...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What was I supposed to do?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Hate me. Forget me.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Is that what you did? Just forget?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I made a mistake.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What? Sleeping with me? Bringing me
dialog: in? Talking to me in that bar?
dialog: Before he can answer--
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: You left me back at square one you
dialog: know? Wandering. So I did what you
dialog: said- worked alone. Got on the
dialog: party circuit, boosting watches and
dialog: traveling for a year before I met
dialog: Rafael in Valencia. We've been
dialog: together ever since. He’s a good
dialog: guy. Generous. Kind.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Glad to hear it... I’m sorry if I--
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: No, you did me a favor. Rafael has
dialog: changed my entire life. I’m in
dialog: love. I’m happy. I should be
dialog: thanking you.
text: Nicky absorbs this. He smiles half-heartedly.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess I’1ll see you around.
text: She gives a kiss on the cheek. A friend’s kiss.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: But look- he doesn’t know about my
dialog: past so-- you don’t know me. Okay?
text: He gets it, but it seems like it hurts to hear it.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Yeah. Okay.
text: He’s left watching her walk away, regretful.
text: He reaches into his lapel pocket, searching for his wallet.
text: It’s still there.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL BAR AREA - LATER
text: Nicky bellies up to another bar at the party- raising a hand
text: to the BARTENDER.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Vodka.
dialog: 75.
text: The bartender places a drink before Nicky. Nicky takes a
text: gulp, but is quickly disappointed.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is water.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Yes sir. I have spoken with
dialog: Marcello.
text: Nicky looks across the party. Marcello looks back at him with
text: a big thumbs up. Nicky tries again.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Give me a real one.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Sir, I couldn't.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It’s okay. I need a drink. Several
dialog: actually.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: He told me to be strong for you.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I’1ll talk to Marcello.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - MARCELLO’S BAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nicky bellies up to Marcello’s bar.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Okay Marcello, you did a great job.
dialog: We're good now. But I really need a
dialog: drink so I want you to make me real
dialog: one. Alright?
speaker_heading: MARCELLO
dialog: Understood sir.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Actually make it a double.
speaker_heading: MARCELLO
text: Coming right up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Marcello pours a huge one into a glass in front of Nicky. He
text: takes a swig.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: This is water.
speaker_heading: MARCELLO
dialog: (to be heard)
dialog: No sir, it is a real drink.
dialog: Absolutely one hundred percent
dialog: genuine.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Who are you talking to? Just give
dialog: me a drink.
speaker_heading: MARCELLO
dialog: I misunderstood sir. I’m sorry...
text: He turns to make another.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No- do it here. Do it right in
text: front of me.
text: Marcello complies and begins to make the drink right before
dialog: him with the proper ingredients.
speaker_heading: MARCELLO
dialog: What do I care? It is not my life.
dialog: What does it matter if you come
dialog: home at three a.m? If you yell and
dialog: scream at your wife while your
text: children cower under the bed afraid
dialog: for their mother’s life? Until one
dialog: day, one of those children comes
text: out from beneath the bed and pushes
text: YOU against the wall and yells NO
dialog: MORE PAPI! NO MORE! I am the man of
dialog: this family now and you can go to
dialog: hell!
text: Marcello places the drink in front of Nicky. He picks it up,
text: ignoring what he just heard and holds it in front of his lips
text: for a long beat. Then, guiltily-
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Fuck you Marcello.
text: He slams down the drink and storms off. Marcello is proud of
dialog: his tough love.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER
text: ON A WAITER with a trayful of drinks. Nicky CUTS HIM OFF,
text: stopping him in his tracks.
dialog: 77.
text: Nicky grabs the tray- and stares down the waiter until he
text: lets go of it.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS
text: On Nicky, sitting on the diving board, drinking while
text: watching Jess and Garriga from afar. The tray is next to him,
text: half of the glasses are empty.
text: He remains indifferent as Owens joins him.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Are you drunk?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: What part of the plan calls for a
dialog: tray full of Lemon Drops, Apple-
dialog: tinis, and Goldschlager shots? Are
dialog: you pledging a sorority house?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I think I may need to rethink the
dialog: plan.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Why? What’s going on? Something
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No. I’m just not feeling it.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: You're not feeling it? This isn’t
dialog: Jazzfest, Thelonious. What’s your
dialog: reason?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Nothing. Forget it. I’m fine. Just
dialog: waiting for the right time.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: You sure? Mr. Garriga is not a guy
dialog: you want to cross... me neither.
dialog: So if there’s something you need to
dialog: say, say it.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I said it. I’m waiting for the
dialog: right time.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: God damned primadonna delicate
dialog: science bullshit. You’re not
dialog: smashing atoms here. This isn’t
dialog: CERN. Just do what you’re being
dialog: paid to do.
dialog: (mutters )
dialog: Shitheel...
text: Owens exits. Nicky shoots back another drink.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL VIP AREA - NIGHT
text: Garriga and Jess LAUGH at an unheard joke. She swats him.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Rafael!!
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Funny, right?
speaker_heading: NICKY (0.S.)
dialog: Hey you!!!
text: They turn to see a very drunk Nicky standing nearby. Owens
text: is tense. Jess is freaked out.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Oh God...
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Don’t worry. He’s a disgruntled
dialog: engineer.
text: SMASH! Nicky throws down his glass. Many guests, including
dialog: McEwen turn.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA (CONT’D)
dialog: I expect you have to something to
dialog: say to m--
text: WHACK! Nicky knocks Garriga off his feet with a very
text: unexpected punch to the face.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: (surprised by punch)
dialog: Oh shit--
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What are you doing!?
text: Garriga hits the ground as the whole room turns to watch.
text: McEwen is one of them. Owens rushes in as--
dialog: 79.
text: WHAM!! Nicky dives atop Garriga, punching and wrestling with
text: him as Owens tries to pull him off.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: (to Nicky)
dialog: Why are you punching me? (WHACK) I
dialog: thought we were shoving. (WHACK)
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You take my ideas, you claim them
dialog: as you’re own. You stole from me!!
text: ON JESS: Not sure how to react.
text: ON NICKY, wildly attacking Garriga.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’M SO DISGRUNTLED!!!
text: Owens and party SECURITY finally peel him off Garriga as Jess
text: tries to figure out what’s going on.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Get him out of here!
text: MCEWEN watches as they drag Nicky away while Garriga tries to
text: urge the guests to resume enjoying the party. McEwen turns
text: and whispers something to his BODYGUARD standing next to him.
text: ON OWENS, yanking Nicky and whispering in his ear.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Oversold it a bit didn’t you?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I was caught in the moment...
text: Owens shoves him off, letting security take him out the rest
dialog: of the way.
text: ON JESS, icing Garriga’'s face as he sits recovering.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: The racing business bonita. That’s
dialog: all...
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Security escorts Nicky out of the party and across the lobby
text: toward the front door.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You can’t throw me out-- I’m
dialog: staying here.
scene_heading: MASSIVE SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Let’s see your key.
text: Nicky digs in his pocket and produces his KEYCARD.
text: Satisfied, they THROW HIM to the floor and walk away.
text: Nicky lays on the refreshingly cool marble of the lobby floor
text: when TWO FEET settle to a stop next to his head.
text: He looks up to find McEwen’s hulking bodyguard, GORDON,
text: looking down at him.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Mr. McEwen would like to have lunch
dialog: in his suite tomorrow. Information
text: is on the card.
text: Gordon drops a card on his chest and walks off. Nicky smiles
text: and slowly rises to his feet to make his way to his room so
text: that he can spend the night vomiting.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: I/E. MCEWEN’S SUITE - DAY
text: Gordon lets Nicky into the palatial suite and escorts him
text: into the living room area. The drapes dance on the breeze
text: blowing in from the balcony doors.
text: Corpulent McEwen is outside, enjoying the view. MUSIC from
text: the pool area below can be heard as Nicky joins him by the
text: railing. They stare outward, side by side.
dialog: A long pause, then-
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: Ever heard of Udo Pappenphus?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No sir.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: An engineer for Ferrari for many
dialog: years. Brilliant. Moved on a few
dialog: times. McLaren, Toyota, different
dialog: teams. A fun fellow. Curious
dialog: fellow. With a name like Udo
dialog: Pappenphus you’d damn well better
dialog: be fun and curious...
dialog: 81.
text: He has Nicky’s attention.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well one day, Udo Pappenphus was
text: found behind a berm with his throat
text: cut ear to ear. Like a giant grin.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Udo Pappenphus, a corporate spy?
dialog: No. Udo Pappenphus was a good
text: father, a brilliant engineer and a
dialog: stupid cunt. Udo Pappenphus brought
text: home a one inch square of
dialog: experimental honeycomb carbon
dialog: composite to show his 10 year old
dialog: son...
dialog: (by rote)
dialog: ..-and they cut his throat from ear
text: to ear like a giant grin or so the
dialog: story goes.
text: It hangs there.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Why tell you this tale? Other than
dialog: the fact I like the sound of Udo
text: Pappenphus as it strolls across my
dialog: tongue? It’s a warning... of what
dialog: you're getting yourself into. He
dialog: was Garriga’s man.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I want three million dollars.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: That’s a lot of money.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It’s the EXR.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Great God almighty...
text: Nicky stares down at the pool party below.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Mmm hmm...
text: NICKY POV: Jess is walking through the crowded pool area in a
dialog: sexy outfit.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: I thought maybe you’d have some
dialog: shit like a dropped cockpit- blown
dialog: diffuser nonsense...
text: Nicky doesn’t answer, distracted.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN (CONT'D)
dialog: But the EXR? You’re Father Bloody
dialog: Christmas come to me.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Uh huh...
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: It’s mine anyway- God knows he
dialog: stole all my engineers from me.
text: As McEwen talks, Nicky walks along the railing to get a
dialog: better look at her.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m going to need to see proof.
text: Nicky watches as Jess embraces Garriga, leaving McEwen
text: waiting for an answer.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you understand?
text: Still no answer from staring Nicky.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell are you looking at?
text: Nicky snaps out of it as McEwen glances down to see.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: Did the pool go Euro?
dialog: (to inside)
dialog: Gordon! Get my field glasses.
text: McEwen squints, spotting Jess.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ahhh. I see the one. She’s a
dialog: beauty. Bet she’s one of those
text: Formula One skanks who follows the
dialog: circuit.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (offended)
dialog: She’s not a race skank.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: Oh- do you know her?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No, I’m just not getting a skanky
dialog: vibe.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: Oh sure she is. The hotel’s lousy
dialog: with them.
speaker_heading: NICKY
text: She looks like a very nice girl.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: Sure. For the right price.
text: McEwen laughs. Nicky scowls as McEwen keeps leering.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Gah. Look at her buttocks.
dialog: (inside)
dialog: Gordon! Field glasses! Now!!
dialog: (then)
text: Chiseled marble lobes...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (bothered)
dialog: Okay, can we get back to business?
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
text: A little small on top, but who
dialog: cares?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (wanting to punch him)
dialog: That's a very subjective topic.
text: One man’s small is another man’s
dialog: perfection.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: Maybe if you're booking a fashion
dialog: show, but I’m talking about
dialog: slapping balls!!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (annoyed, short)
dialog: Listen- Do you want the stuff or
dialog: not?
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: MCEWEN
dialog: Of course I do. GORDON GET ME MY
text: FIELD GLASSES YOU MOUTH BREATHING
speaker_heading: YABBY!
dialog: (then, to Nicky)
dialog: But I’m gonna need proof first.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You'll have it. I’11 contact you.
dialog: Then it’s three million. Cash.
text: Nicky exits, running into bodyguard GORDON as he’s delivering
text: SMALL BINOCULARS to McEwen.
text: Nicky grabs them from him and quickly breaks them in half.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry.
text: He gives them back and exits.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL AREA BAR —- DAY
text: A cloistered pool bar partially separated from the pool area
text: by tall landscaping. Jess arrives with an empty glass. A
text: BLONDE BARTENDER helps her.
speaker_heading: BLONDE BARTENDER
dialog: Sangria?
text: Jess nods as the bartender tops off her glass. Nicky appears
text: behind her.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Let me get this one...
text: Jess is not pleased.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Just having a drink.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You don’t know me, remember?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Just having a drink. Stranger.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What was that last night? Was that
dialog: about me?
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Well, a little bit about you.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Are you working an angle on Rafael?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No. I’m working for him. It’s
dialog: nothing. Trust me.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Trust you. Of course.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I know. I deserve that-- but...
dialog: when you grow up in this- with a
dialog: father like mine, you don’t just
dialog: trust people. It’s not done. It’s--
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Is that it? It’s all your dad’s
dialog: fault? I get it. I forgive you
dialog: okay? But if Rafael sees us, I
dialog: don’t know what’s gonna happen.
dialog: He’s the jealous type. Goodbye.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You're missing the point.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Oh really? Then tell me- what’s the
dialog: point?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: The point is... I don’t know what
dialog: the point is. A chance to explain?
dialog: Talk? I don’t know- make it up to
dialog: you?
text: She thinks. She’s wrestling with something. A deep breath,
dialog: a big sigh, then-
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: To be perfectly honest. I was kind
dialog: of happy to see you. It’s just-- I
dialog: mean, three years is a long time. I
dialog: guess I should just get over it...
text: Nicky leaves a silence, hoping she’1ll say more.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Things with Rafael are...
dialog: complicated. I was just painting a
dialog: pretty picture. I mean, things are
dialog: fine but... it’s a strange world
dialog: and sometimes...
text: She drifts off in thought for a moment, a vulnerability
text: behind her eyes.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: I could actually use a... a
dialog: distraction. You know? I get
dialog: lonely here. He’s so busy...
text: Her eyes start to well. She gathers herself.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: God- I must sound like such a train
dialog: wreck...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No. No, no... not at all.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: (big sigh)
dialog: It was fun in Miami wasn’t it?
text: Nicky smiles and nods. She moves closer.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: I kind of miss the game. I miss
dialog: you.
dialog: (she thinks)
dialog: If I were to slip away. I mean, if
dialog: I could... do you think...?
dialog: (then)
dialog: It’s a mistake, forget it.
text: He leans in, seeing his chance.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: We can do whatever you want to do.
dialog: I can keep you safe...
text: She leans in even closer, whispering-
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You taught me so much. But I’ve
dialog: learned a lot since then. I'd
dialog: really love to show you all the
dialog: things I’ve learned...
text: Nicky would like that. She moves toward his lips.
dialog: 87.
text: A KISS, gentle but simmering. Once it ends-
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Like how I learned how to play men
dialog: like I just played you.
text: Nicky instantly backs off, chiding himself. Jess smiles and
text: skewers him.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: You're pathetic. I think you’re
dialog: losing it.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: When did you learn that?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: “I'll keep you safe?” BLECH! What
dialog: the hell was that? Does that get
dialog: you laid?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: That was not a line!
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I'm not falling for your shit again
dialog: Nicky. And I’m very happy. Stay
dialog: away from me.
text: She walks away. Nicky admonishes himself. Then--
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: And you're still an easy lift...
text: She tosses back his wallet as she disappears from view,
text: leaving Nicky wanting her more than ever.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: EXT. ALEXANDER MCQUEEN BOUTIQUE - DAY
text: Jess emerges from Garriga’s Escalade and an Argentine
text: SALESWOMAN opens the door to greet her.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: We've been expecting you...
scene_heading: INT. ALEXANDER MCQUEEN FITTING AREA - DAY
text: Splendid dresses all around.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN (0.S.)
text: Seflor Garriga’s assistant called.
dialog: We pulled a few things they said
dialog: you might like...
text: Jess is at the mirror decked out in an amazing dress as the
text: saleswoman stands beside her.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I think this one would just about
dialog: kill him.
speaker_heading: SALESWOMAN
dialog: It’s breathtaking, is it not?
dialog: It is.
scene_heading: EXT. BUENOS AIRES STREET - LATER
text: Jess is laden with bags, continuing her shopping expedition.
text: Passing a BUS STOP where several ELDERLY PEOPLE get on a bus,
text: she notices a PURSE on the ground nearby. She tries to get
dialog: the attention of the boarding passengers...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Whoa whoa-- wait! Hello? Hello!
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: I mean hola! Wait...
text: Too late-- the bus door CLOSES and it pulls away. Frustrated
text: for a moment, Jess is overcome by a touch of her pickpocket
text: past as she picks up the purse.
text: She looks around quickly then digs into the purse. Not much-
text: an ADDRESS BOOK, some KEYS and a WALLET with a few PESOS and
text: PICTURES of a SWEET OLD COUPLE - The wife beaming and the
text: husband in a WHEELCHAIR.
text: She is overcome with guilt. She flips to the first page of
text: the address book and quickly finds the woman’s information.
text: She dials the number. An OLD MAN answers.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Hola?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Hola-- um, hi, your wife, um--
dialog: espousa? She--
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Que?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Habla ingles?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Que? No habla--
text: CLICK. He hangs up. Jess is stymied for a moment, then--
scene_heading: EXT. BUENOS AIRES SIDE STREET/COURTYARD - LATER
text: Jess scans building numbers, referring to the address book
text: periodically. The Escalade follows her slowly. She comes
text: upon a residential COURTYARD, entering to find--
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: So you do still have a heart.
text: Grinning Nicky is seated at a garden table in the courtyard
text: with an open bottle of Malbec and two glasses. Jess is pissed
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Oh God! Seriously?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (as old man)
dialog: Si, estoy muy en serio.
text: She tosses the address book at him.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You are a dick! Stop wasting my
dialog: time!
text: She stomps off. He follows.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: C’mon just sit with me. Have a
dialog: little wine. Isn’t this romantic?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Yes! Stalking really turns my crank
text: She gets inside the Escalade and it drives off.
scene_heading: INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS
text: Jess huffs at her situation when, DING! Her phone receives
text: a TEXT. She looks down to read--
dialog: "Sorry"
dialog: DING! Another text:
dialog: 90.
dialog: “Didn't know how else to get your number"
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Dammit...
text: She’s mad at herself, but also a little amused...
scene_heading: INT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - NICKY’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: It’s late. Nicky lounges on his bed, watching A_La Cama Con
text: Porcel on TV, eating gummy bears and drinking a beer.
text: DING. His phone lights up with a TEXT. It’s Jess.
dialog: “What's the matter? Can't sleep?”
text: He quickly sits up, spilling his beer. He thinks a moment.
text: DING. Another text: “Your light is still on.”
text: He looks to the window. Is she watching?
text: DING. Another text. “Be at the terrace garden in 5.”
text: A smile. He springs into action-- putting on a shirt and
text: quickly freshening up in the bathroom mirror.
text: He EXITS.
dialog: Beat.
text: He re-enters, smelling his armpits. Quickly applies
text: deodorant, leaves again.
scene_heading: EXT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL GARDEN - NIGHT
text: Nicky arrives at the garden on the hotel grounds. He looks
text: for Jess. No sign of her.
text: DING. A text: “Turn around”
text: He slowly turns. He’s facing the hotel.
dialog: DING. “Look up”
text: He does. Scanning upward a few floors until he sees--
text: Jess, in heavy shadow, silhouetted by the light spilling from
dialog: her suite.
dialog: 91.
text: He watches as she slowly undoes the sash of her robe, not yet
text: opening it.
text: She turns and moves inside, diffused by the sheer curtains
text: and warm light inside.
text: Nicky walks with her as she enters the bedroom. He's rapt,
text: not noticing as he walks through a manicured flower bed.
text: She stops, her back to him, still diffused by the curtains.
text: He stops and watches as she DROPS HER ROBE. Although
text: obscured slightly by the curtains, he can see her turn her
text: head and he can discern a sly smile. Then--
text: Garriga enters the bedroom, shirtless, hairy and libidinous.
text: She turns to him and embraces him.
text: Nicky shoulders his disappointment and frustration as they
text: vanish from view.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.

speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD

speaker_heading: NICKY

speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: Don’t question my professionalism.

dialog: every hour?
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: Why? So I can stand in front of a

speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: In my bag.
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE - DAY
text: Farhad carries a small bag as he works his way through the
text: crowded area. He negotiates his way past tables, eyeing
text: passersby wearily.
text: He turns his gaze ahead, locking in then palms the side
text: pocket of his bag, checking for the mysterious contents.
text: FARHAD POV: The crowd parts, revealing his mark at a table--
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: Hey there.
text: It’s JESS. She looks up to see him, pleasantly surprised.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Farhad!
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: Jess.
text: She leaps to her feet and they hug.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Oh my god! You’ve lost so much
dialog: weight!
text: He looks exactly the same.
dialog: They do.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: I did a cleanse.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You here with Nicky?
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: Sort of. Can I bend your ear?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Sure, sit down...
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: You've got Nicky all nuts.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I do? Good.
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: I’ve never seen him like this. You
dialog: know he hasn’t worked since Miami?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: I know he’s an asshole. I mean, a
dialog: really big asshole. But he’s my
dialog: friend and I’m going to bat for
dialog: him. Can’t you give the asshole a
dialog: break?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Okay, he flew you down here just to
dialog: talk to me?
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: He knew you and me hit it off in
dialog: Miami with me showing you pictures
dialog: of my family and my dick and all.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Well yeah, that was special.
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: I don’t know- I think he thought
dialog: that maybe you would listen to me
dialog: being that we was so close.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I don’t know what to say Farhad,
dialog: it’s been a long time.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: He told me you got a thing going
dialog: with this Spanish dude, what’s his
dialog: face...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Yeah well that’s where things get
dialog: complex...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ON NICKY, watching from the car, squinting at Farhad and Jess
text: through the crowd.
text: They gab and eventually LAUGH uproariously.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
text: Farhad and Jess continue their conversation.
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: Nothing in life is easy you know?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Listen- I know what he is. He may
dialog: be obsessed with me now, but he’1l
dialog: forget about me just like he did
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: I don’t think you’ve got that
dialog: right. He seems different... and
dialog: I’ve known him a long time.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Yeah?
text: Farhad pulls a small box from his bag and hands it to her.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: (opening it)
dialog: What is it...?
text: She lifts the lid to find the DECO STYLE GARNET NECKLACE she
dialog: coveted way back in Miami.
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: He kept it for you. All this time.
text: Her eyes say it all.
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMINITO LA BOCA DISTRICT - DAY
text: Jess and Nicky walk along the blocks of brightly painted
text: homes in the historical neighborhood.
text: The mood is a bit awkward, but it’s a start.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: So I’m here. What’d you want to say
dialog: to me?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: This feels like a job interview.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I don’t have all day.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: So cold. You’ve changed.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: No. This isn’t how I treat people,
dialog: it’s how I treat you.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: So you're saying I have a special
dialog: place in your heart?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I don’t know about my heart.
dialog: Something south of that. It might
dialog: be pollups.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You’re making this so easy.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: No problem. I can’t wait for the
dialog: sucking sound of your empty
dialog: platitudes.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You are so mean. I hope you’re not
dialog: a pet owner because you are
dialog: definitely a kick the dog type.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I have a lizard. You'd get along.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Again with the mean. Have pity.
text: She stops him and makes eye contact.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You. Are. A dick.
text: She turns and walks away.
text: She stops.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I totally lost it, okay?
text: Turns around.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Never happened to me before. Never.
dialog: (stream of conscious)
dialog: I was laying there that night and I
dialog: couldn’t sleep and I was just
dialog: looking at you and I was totally
dialog: prepared to tell you anything.
dialog: Whatever you wanted to hear.
dialog: Everything. All my secrets...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Oh Jesus...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: That’s never happened to me. I- I -
dialog: I had images of us, like... like...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Like... together.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Like sexy stuff?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No! Like normal stuff! Like camping
text: at Yosemite. Driving to Big Sur.
text: Eating crab at Fisherman's Wharf.
dialog: It was all in California for some
dialog: reason-- which is weird because
dialog: I’ve only been there once when I
dialog: was eight and I’m allergic to
dialog: shellfish.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I’m allergic to shellfish.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Really? See how well we’re hitting
dialog: it off?
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Okay- we need to find someplace to
dialog: sit ‘cause I think you’re having a
dialog: meltdown.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZOLETA DE LOS SUSPIROS - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: Jess and Nicky sit at the edge of a QUAINT WHARF overlooking
text: a harbor at the edge of the neighborhood. Colorful tugs and
text: fishing boats are moored nearby as Jess PUTS THE NECKLACE ON.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Looks nice.
text: Jess accepts the compliment but changes the subject.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Farhad said you didn’t work for a
dialog: long time...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Couple years, yeah. Didn’t feel
dialog: right. Actually started feeling bad
dialog: about doing it... which is not
dialog: something you want ina
dialog: professional con artist. Empathy, a
dialog: heart... what a disaster.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Yeah. God forbid.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Seriously. Not so much about the
dialog: rich guys. But I think about some
dialog: of the ones when I was little. My
dialog: dad and I would run this scheme at
dialog: these churches. I’d speak in
dialog: tongues and he’d translate for a
dialog: donation. What happened to those
dialog: people? Or when I was 15, I rana
dialog: credit card scam on this video
dialog: store in Pennsylvania- back when
dialog: they had the carbon paper slips? I
dialog: drove back there last year and it’s
text: not there. Video store was gone.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Don’t you think that was online
dialog: streaming? Or Netflix or the big
dialog: red thing at the grocery stores?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: What is that thing?
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Don’t tell me you blame yourself
dialog: for Borders Books too.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No. That was the Kindle.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Wow you really have become a wuss.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It was a crisis of faith.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: All brought on by sleeping with me?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: RedBox! That’s the thing at the
dialog: grocery store.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Did you just say that? Was that a
dialog: naughty inference?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Maybe you’re not such a wuss.
dialog: Smiles. Then--
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I even reached out to my dad.
dialog: Hadn't seen him in years. We
dialog: buried a lot of our crap. Asked him
dialog: if he’d ever gone straight. He was
dialog: like, “I go straight every time I’m
dialog: on parole.” He told me that you
dialog: can’t live this life and then not
dialog: live it. ‘Be a man and move on...’
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I’m working on it.
text: Jess thinks a moment, reflecting.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You said this was no way to live.
dialog: That I’d never be able to trust
dialog: anyone. I didn’t believe you then,
dialog: but I do now. I cut myself off.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: All brought on by sleeping with me?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I was headed that way anyway. It
dialog: wasn't that big of a deal.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Was that a dig?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Just a little one.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Clever.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Why’d you go to all this trouble
dialog: Nicky. Absolution? Forgiveness?
dialog: Piece of mind? What?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I can convince anyone of anything.
dialog: One time I convinced a man that an
text: empty warehouse with a single chair
dialog: in it was the federal reserve. So
dialog: I’m good. A good liar.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Yeah. You’re the best.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: But what I wanted to do was tell
dialog: you the truth. To tell you the
dialog: truth and to look into your eyes
dialog: and...
dialog: (inhales)
dialog: I just need for you to believe me.
text: They stare at one another. Nicky awaits her answer.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I want to believe you Nicky. I
dialog: really do.
text: He’s disappointed.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to go.
text: MUSIC. He watches as she walks away, late afternoon sun
text: warmly reflecting off of her.
text: She approaches a TAXI and gets in. Nicky turns his gaze to
text: the sun setting on the harbor.
text: It’s not long before Farhad ambles up behind him and rests a
text: sympathetic hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: FAT ASS FARHAD
dialog: Let’s get something to eat.
scene_heading: INT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: A sullen Nicky rides the elevator. It stops. A COUPLE
text: boards. Down the hall an ELDERLY WOMAN makes her way toward
text: the door. She looks up just as the door closes.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: Por favor.
text: Nicky put his arm out and holds the door. The woman enters.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Gracias.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: De nada.
scene_heading: INT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: The elevator doors open. Nicky exits and makes his way back
text: to his room when he STOPS--
text: Jess sits at his door. She rises, she looks shaken, possibly
text: roughed up. He goes to her, quick to console.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: What happened? What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I don’t want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Did he--
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Just kiss me.
dialog: 103.
text: He does. A loving kiss that’s been a long time in the making.
text: They quickly lose themselves as he backs her to the door.
text: Never breaking their embrace, Jess reaches into Nicky’s
text: pocket and pulls out his room key. Blindly fumbling for the
text: lock, Jess continues to kiss him as the door opens to reveal
text: a short HALLWAY leading to the bedroom.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS SLOWLY as Jess and Nicky stumble down the
text: hallway, locked into each other, heading toward the BEDROOM.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY as they land on the bed and continue.
speaker_heading: MATCH DISSOLVE:
text: CAMERA CONTINUES to move in as DAYLIGHT fills the bedroom and
text: arrives at the bed to settle on the couple intertwined with
text: one another the NEXT MORNING.
text: MUSICAL INTERLUDE as they look at one another, communicating
text: only with long looks and smiles- each enjoying the other’s
text: company without a word.
text: It’s a simple and pure moment, not cloying or forced. Totally
text: candid and unadorned, they are at once playful and loving.
text: Eventually Nicky’s face grows a touch more serious. There’s
dialog: something he has to say. Then-
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I’m leaving soon.
text: Conflict, concern play across Jess’ face but she says nothing
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come with me.
text: She clearly wants to but doesn’t say. He grasps for a reason.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you think you love him but I
dialog: want you to come with me. Tonight.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Nicky... I don’t love him. But the
dialog: thing is -
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You can’t trust me.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I know and it probably serves me
dialog: right. But I’ve changed and I know
dialog: I can’t prove that but I’ve
dialog: changed.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Nicky there’s something -
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: He’s going to be at the track. Go
dialog: get your stuff and come back here.
dialog: I just have to finish my business
dialog: and we’ll be gone.
text: She sighs. Unsure where to begin. But before she can say-
text: Nicky’s phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit...
dialog: (looks at phone)
dialog: It’s Owens. I gotta take it.
text: She grows concerned. He answers.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: OWENS (0.S.)
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Just in my room.
speaker_heading: OWENS (0.S.)
dialog: Good. I’m at the door.
text: Nicky hangs up, wincing.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: He’s here.
text: Nicky gets up, grabs his pants as Jess puts on a nearby ROBE.
text: ON NICKY, heading down the hall for the front door, passing a
text: DIVIDER WALL that separates the bed and bath section of the
text: suite from the living area.
text: He opens the door to reveal a suspicious Owens holding a
text: SMALL PACKAGE. Nicky plays it cool.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey...
text: Owens comes in uninvited. Nicky leads him to the living area.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Still sleeping? I thought you were
text: meeting with McEwen...
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I’m on it. I have time.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: There’s a lazy Sunday softness to
dialog: your generation-- makes me
dialog: uncomfortable.
text: Owens wanders along the living area. It’s obvious he’s
dialog: looking for something or someone.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: I like to be on my feet. I'11 lay
dialog: down when I get cancer. Or if I
dialog: fuck. Both of which will be done on
dialog: my back in case you were wondering.
text: He heads for the OPEN FRENCH DOORS that lead to the BEDROOM.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I’m glad you decided to share your
dialog: life philosophy with me. I’m
dialog: already seeing the world ina
dialog: different light.
text: Owens arrives at the FRENCH DOORS just as Jess is DUCKING OUT
text: the other BEDROOM DOOR, CLOSING IT as she goes.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Sarcasm. Another pillar of your
dialog: generation. You want to tell
dialog: somebody to fuck off, tell ‘em to
dialog: fuck off. Don’t say, ‘gee, what a
dialog: great jacket.’ It’s weakness.
text: Nicky rolls his eyes as Owens glances through to the bed.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s a messy bed.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I don’t sleep well.
text: ON JESS, heading for the front door.
text: BACK ON OWENS, entering the bedroom.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Someone here?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No.
text: Owens GRABS THE KNOB of the main bedroom door.
text: ON JESS, trying to quietly open the front door when--
text: OWENS OPENS the bedroom door, forcing her to duck into the
dialog: living room.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: You know why you don’t sleep well?
dialog: Added complexity to the point of
dialog: distraction.
text: He closes the door behind him and wanders down the hallway
text: that leads to the front door. JESS is on the other side of
text: the dividing wall in the living area, matching his pace.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: All of you with your phones and
dialog: computers that bring nothing but a
text: barrage of useless information.
text: Nicky gets in front of him, hoping to lead him to the door
text: and facilitate his exit-- not noticing Owens grabbing a SMALL
text: TRASH CAN and setting a trap for Jess by putting it in front
text: of the bedroom door.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Fucking Twitter? Like anyone really
dialog: cares that you’re eating a turkey
dialog: sandwich for lunch.
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Sorry... ‘Panini.’
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Sarcasm?
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Satire.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Are you here for a reason?
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Who'd you pick up at the airport?
text: ON JESS, on the other side of the dividing wall. She catches
text: sight of the trap Owens laid- she can’t go through the
dialog: bedroom again.
dialog: 107.
text: Nicky arrives at the door first, glancing back at the living
text: area and CATCHES A GLIMPSE of Jess SLIPPING ONTO THE BALCONY.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Garriga has you following me?
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: I got people there.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: He’s my computer guy.
text: Owens blows past him and re-enters the living area.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Why? Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: There won’t be. Because he came.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: I got a little red hair on my taint
dialog: that tickles when something's
dialog: afoot. Lately I’ve been scratching
dialog: my nethers like a fucking Macaque.
text: He wanders toward the balcony. Nicky follows.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Look. Nothing’s going on.
dialog: Everything’s on schedule. We’re
dialog: wrapping up. No one should get
dialog: spooked just because we’re near the
dialog: end.
text: This stops Owens for a moment- just short of the balcony. He
text: turns. He sizes Nicky up. Nicky gestures to the front door.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now come on. Let me do my job.
text: Owens stares him down. And just when it seems he’s satisfied-
text: He turns and walks onto the balcony. Nicky cringes,
dialog: following him out to find--
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
text: NOTHING. Jess isn’t there, only Owens. He stares out at the
text: grounds resolutely.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Nice day.
dialog: 108.
text: He goes back inside, leaving Nicky looking around for Jess.
text: He looks to the NEXT BALCONY. The gap is impossibly wide, but-
text: JESS POKES HER HEAD UP. Somehow she made the jump and, from
text: the look of her it was terrifying. She’s rattled to the bone.
text: He mouths, ‘You okay?’ She manages a nod. He pulls his ROOM
text: KEY from his pocket and tosses it to her. She catches it.
text: He pantomimes, “Meet here. 7 O’clock...” then heads inside.
scene_heading: INT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - NICKY’S ROOM -— CONTINUOUS
text: Nicky enters to find Owens placing the small package on the
text: table and LOOKING AT HIS WATCH--
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Call us when you finish with
dialog: McEwen.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Will you stop worrying? I’m on my
dialog: way.
scene_heading: EXT. MCEWEN TEST TRACK — DAY
text: In the pit, Nicky, McEwen and the Tech sit before monitors

speaker_heading: MCEWEN

speaker_heading: NICKY

speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jess?

scene_heading: INT. GORDON’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Gordon drives on a HIGHWAY, tuning in the game on the radio.
text: BEEP. Another TEXT. He reads it out of the corner of his eye.
text: He continues to drive a bit, then puts on his blinker and
scene_heading: EXITS AN OFF RAMP.
scene_heading: INT. GORDON’S CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Gordon drives down a city street, looking for street signs.
text: Eventually he makes a turn and digs through the shopping bag
text: next to him until he pulls out the NIGHT GUARD he purchased.
text: He tries to open the packaging with great difficulty, finally
text: tearing it apart with his teeth. He PUTS THE MOUTHPIECE IN.
text: Still driving, LOUDLY BREATHING through the hole in the
text: mouthpiece. He reaches back into the bag for the NECK BRACE.
text: HE PUTS IT ON, turns up the game on the radio and SLAMS HIS
text: FOOT ON THE PEDAL.
text: VROOM! Within moments he’s moving at INCREDIBLE SPEED down
dialog: the city street.
text: CAMERA HOLDS ON GORDON as the car gets faster and faster, the
text: noise of the engine and the game BUILDING IN VOLUME until--
text: CRASH! The windows SHATTER, the AIRBAG EXPLODES-- absorbing
text: Gordon’s mass as best it can.
text: He stunned for a moment but soon shakes it off. He opens the
text: door and, removing his neckbrace--
scene_heading: EXT. BUENOS AIRES HOTEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Gordon exits the car, shedding the neckbrace.
text: He pulls a PISTOL from inside his jacket and spits out the
text: night guard just as he arrives at the CAR he just hit to find-
text: JESS AND NICKY, bloodied and disoriented in Nicky’s car.
text: They're alive enough to see a gun is pointed right at them.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: A few ominous beats of darkness.
dialog: 114.
text: SLOW, REVERBERANT FOOTSTEPS are heard.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. AUTO WORKSHOP - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON expensive OXFORDS walking across the cold concrete
text: of a dimly lit INDUSTRIAL SPACE-- passing tools and equipment
text: and eventually revealing a disturbing TABLEAU--
text: Jess and Nicky, BOUND and GAGGED with tape, seated on CHAIRS.
text: Gordon sits watch nearby, tending to his own small wounds
text: with the rubbing alcohol and gauze he bought while holding
text: them at GUNPOINT.
text: The TWO DUFFELS OF CASH are opened in front of them.
text: They all look to the newly arrived man who stops before them.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA (0.S.)
text: Remove the tape from his mouth.
text: REVEAL Garriga looking on them with disdain. Owens is a few
text: steps behind him, settling in as Gordon removes the tape,
text: from Nicky. Jess is left gagged. She’s scared.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you really think I’m such an
dialog: amateur that I would not have
dialog: someone on the inside with McEwen?
dialog: Someone to keep eyes on you?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Twenty years in this business teach
dialog: you never to be too careful. He’s
dialog: my secret weapon...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Now imagine my surprise when Gordon
dialog: showed me what you sold to McEwen.
dialog: Not some fake software as we
dialog: discussed. But my plans, my
dialog: designs,
dialog: (explodes )
text: THE REAL EXR! STOLEN FROM MY
text: SERVERS! STOLEN FROM ME!!!
dialog: (then)
dialog: What’s more- You sold it to McEwen
dialog: for three million dollars. But in
dialog: these bags there is 27 million
dialog: dollars which means YOU SOLD IT TO
speaker_heading: EVERYONE!
text: His anger ECHOES through the facility.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA (CONT'D)
text: THIS IS MY REPUTATION. THIS IS MY
dialog: STANDING. YOU'VE MADE ME LOOK LIKE
speaker_heading: AN AMATEUR!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You hired a con man.
text: THWACK! Owens punches Nicky’s insolent mouth.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Theiving piece of shite.
text: Garriga gets a tenuous hold on his rage.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: So- before the inevitable bloody
dialog: end, I want to know how. How did
dialog: you get the information?
text: He DARTS TOWARD JESS in a rage.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA (CONT'D)
text: AND WHAT DID SHE HAVE TO DO WITH
dialog: IT!?
text: He GRABS HER by the throat with one hand, PINCHING HER NOSE
text: with the other.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No no--
text: Nicky is powerless as Jess struggles for air.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: TELL ME!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Stop! I'll tell you! She had
dialog: nothing to do with it! I/’11 tell
dialog: you!
text: He lets go, turns his glare on Nicky.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: She's totally innocent. I have a
dialog: guy- he cracked your encryption,
dialog: found a backdoor into your servers,
dialog: it was easy. You should really fire
dialog: your I.T. guy by the way...
text: This angers Garriga.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: No. You used my login, my password.
dialog: How did you get it?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It’s easy. Just brute force.
dialog: Computer tries all possible
dialog: combinations. Infinite monkeys,
dialog: infinite typewriters-—
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Bullshit! Liar!
text: Garriga whips out a key fob SECURITY KEY (A real device for
text: high end cybersecurity that randomly generates passwords on
text: its small display).
speaker_heading: GARRIGA (CONT’D)
dialog: This generates a new password every
dialog: 15 minutes and it never leaves my
dialog: sight. How did you get it?!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: What’s it matter? It’s done.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Tell me!
text: He pinches Jess’ nose again. Gordon cocks his pistol.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Leave her alone!
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: HOW? !
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Let go!
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: HOW! ?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: ALL RIGHT FINE IT WAS HER!!!
text: Garriga backs off. Jess is shocked, she looks to Nicky.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: But she didn’t know it. She didn’t
dialog: know anything.
text: Jess tries to speak, shocked. Garriga is intrigued.
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Your security is tight- tighter
dialog: than I expected.
text: QUICK FLASH: Nicky in his room, trying to hack into
text: Garriga’s servers with great difficulty.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought I could break the key,
dialog: but I couldn’t. I was ready to give
dialog: up- but when I saw Jess at the
dialog: party-
text: QUICK FLASH: Nicky and Jess talking at the party.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: --once I knew you were together, I
dialog: had something to work with.
text: Jess, still bound, looks on with disbelief. She shakes her
text: head, trying to speak as Nicky’s eyes go cold.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: (cold)
dialog: I used her. I’ve been using her.
text: He looks at Jess’ pained face, he has no sympathy for her.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s a science to winning
dialog: someone over. For a woman it’s all
dialog: about emotion. Connection.
text: QUICK FLASH: Nicky and Jess at the pool bar.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to make them believe you
dialog: feel emotion as strongly as they
dialog: do... It’s what they’ve been
dialog: waiting for all their lives...
text: QUICK FLASH: At the pool bar, Nicky talks about Miami.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: Shared history was my in. After
dialog: that you open her up.
text: QUICK FLASH: Farhad greeting Jess.
speaker_heading: NICKY
text: A friendly face sets her off
dialog: balance, defuses aggression. You
dialog: talk about emotional matters.
dialog: 118.
text: QUICK FLASH: Nicky pouring his heart out to Jess.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Body language- arms down, you’re
text: exposed. They pick up on it. And
dialog: once you get them talking, you move
dialog: into their personal space- not from
dialog: the front, that’s aggression-- but
text: from the side.
text: QUICK FLASH of Nicky and Jess talking in the Boca
text: neighborhood while he slides in next to her.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sociologists call it the Gauchais
text: Reaction. They’re disarmed.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Now they’re open. You know you’re
dialog: there once they start to mimic you
text: unconsciously. A head bob, a hand
dialog: movement. It means you’re in sync.
dialog: Then you seal the deal. Tell her
dialog: she’s changed you. Changed how you
dialog: see the world. And then you
dialog: close...
text: FLASHBACK TO THE WATERFRONT as Jess puts the NECKLACE on.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Give her a talisman, a symbol, or
dialog: in this case, a gift that says ‘you
dialog: were always in my thoughts...’
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ON JESS, tied up, crying as Nicky keeps explaining.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
text: There was a wireless keylogger in
dialog: the necklace.
text: QUICK FLASH: Jess returns to the suite with the necklace box.
text: and hides it in her drawer.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: All she had to do was bring it back
dialog: to the room...
text: QUICK FLASH: Garriga works on his iPad in his room, he
text: glances at the display on his security key and starts typing
text: in a password with his WIRELESS KEYBOARD.
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
text: ...It picked up the keystrokes and
dialog: I got it all.
text: QUICK FLASH: Nicky sits at his laptop in his room, RECEIVING
text: THE DATA on his laptop as JESS SLEEPS IN THE BACKGROUND.
speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: Then I logged into your server as
dialog: you and downloaded everything I
dialog: could find about the EXR...
text: And as he LOGS INTO GARRIGA’S SERVER--
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE:
text: Garriga stares at Nicky, absorbing this. Jess closes her
text: teary eyes, devastated.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It’s not her fault. She had no
dialog: idea. She got fooled, but she’s
dialog: not to blame. Just let her go.
text: He looks to teary Jess.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: She shakes her head.
text: Garriga thinks. He looks to Owens. A beat, then--
text: He starts LAUGHING. Nicky is confused. Owens LAUGHS too.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: What? What’s so funny?
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: I think he’s lost his mind!
text: Laughing continues. Gordon seems perplexed. He laughs anyway.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: What?
text: Unable to talk, Garriga motions for Owens to pull off the
text: tape from Jess’ mouth.
speaker_heading: NICKY (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
text: Owens removes the tape. Jess looks to Nicky.
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Oh my God you really do love me.
text: Nicky is flummoxed.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re so screwed.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: What are you talking about?!
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Garriga’s not my boyfriend. I
dialog: hardly even know him.
text: ON NICKY, absolutely blindsided.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: What the hell were you saying about
dialog: me and her? She’s just a race
dialog: skank!
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Race skank!? What is that?!
text: Nicky can’t believe his ears.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: She's been driving me crazy,
dialog: hanging around, flirting, teasing--
dialog: and the minute I try to get her up
dialog: to my room? A headache, a period.
dialog: The world’s longest period. She’s
dialog: never even been in my room.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Jess? What the fuck?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I was just trying to make you
dialog: jealous.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You did! I saw you in his room.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: It was a hooker. I sent her up to
dialog: his room.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: That’s not true.
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: It’s true, I use prostitutas.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (to Jess)
dialog: I saw your face!
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You saw what I wanted you to see.
dialog: You taught me that, remember.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You are a race skank.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I am not a race skank!
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Not a very good one at least.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Then what the hell were you doing
dialog: with him?!
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I was trying to steal his watch. I
text: was on him for a week, waiting for
dialog: my chance and then you showed up.
text: Garriga holds up his wrist, displaying a gorgeous timepiece.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: This watch?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (to Jess)
dialog: You're still doing watches?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: It’s a Richard Mille! It’s worth
dialog: 500,000 dollars!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You’re so much better than watches!
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I’m good at it- It’s what I like!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: But he roughed you up!
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: He didn’t, he did.
dialog: 122.
text: Jess motions to Owens. Nicky glares at him.
speaker_heading: OWENS
text: She was stealing from him.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: He caught me racking up charges on
dialog: Garriga’s credit line. He scared
dialog: the shit out of me.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: (to Owens)
dialog: This is unbelievable...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (to Jess)
dialog: Just to make me jealous? Were you
dialog: ever gonna tell me?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: I tried to!
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Enough.
speaker_heading: NICKY
text: Like a killer whale playing with a
dialog: baby seal...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Oh that’s rich! Like you’re the
dialog: great communicator!
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Quiet!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: What was I supposed to say? “I’m
dialog: ripping off your boyfriend please
dialog: don’t tell him?”
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Oh that’s a convenient excuse!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It makes perfect sense! If it was
dialog: a lie, it was a white lie!
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: QUIET!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I care about you! I was worried
dialog: about you!
dialog: 123.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You were worried about a duffle bag
dialog: full of cash is what you were
dialog: worried about!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: How can you say that? I just tried
dialog: to save your life!
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: By lying! Like you always do! Black
dialog: lies!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: We're both liars! That’s why we're
dialog: together! And if it wasn’t a white
dialog: lie then it was a grey one! A light
dialog: grey one--
text: BANG! Owens SHOOTS NICKY IN THE CHEST, flipping him backward
text: in his chair.
text: Jess SCREAMS as he lands on the floor, gasping. We’re
text: instantly back to a harsh reality.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Nicky!!
text: Garriga is as shocked as anyone.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: What the fuck are you doing?!
text: Jess continues to SCREAM.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: I couldn't take another fucking
dialog: word.
text: STAY ON JESS as she watches Nicky struggle to stay alive,
text: Garriga and Owens argue in the background.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Control yourself with that cannon!
dialog: It will bring the police!!
text: Nicky is fading quickly. Jess throws herself off the chair,
text: landing on her knees, fighting her bonds to get to Nicky.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Nicky Nicky Nicky- look at me...
text: He’s writhing and gasping and delirious.
dialog: 124.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Toledo...? Is it Toledo...?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What? Nicky it’s me.
text: Nicky is quickly lost in a haze of pain and lack of air.
text: Owens holds the gun to Jess’ head. She’s too preoccupied with
dialog: dying Nicky to care.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: What about her?
text: Garriga thinks. He steps up to her.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA
dialog: Look at me.
text: She ignores him, staring at dying Nicky.
text: Garriga grabs her chin, turning her head to him. She glares
dialog: at him--
text: Then SWINGS AT HIM WILDLY with her bound hands. He bats off
text: her attack easily, quickly gaining control.
text: She burns with hatred and despair.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA (CONT’D)
dialog: Lo siento quierda...
text: He lets go. Headed for the door- motioning for Gordon to
dialog: follow him out.
speaker_heading: GARRIGA (CONT’D)
dialog: (to Owens)
dialog: Kill her. Just do it quietly.
text: Garriga and Gordon EXIT as Jess returns her attention to
text: Nicky, who is slipping away fast.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Look at me look at me-- look at me.
text: Glassy eyed, Nicky barely manages to focus on her voice.
speaker_heading: JESS (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you. I love you. Look at my
dialog: eyes. I believe you. I believe you.
dialog: I love you. I trust you.
text: A long moment and-- he’s gone.
dialog: 125.
text: She collapses on him, devastated. And as she cries, the
text: sound of OWENS rummaging through METAL DRAWERS AND CABINETS
text: is heard.
text: She glances over to see OWENS-- collecting a strange
text: assortment of FRIGHTENING IMPLEMENTS AND DUCT TAPE from the
text: workshop shelves into a tool tray.
dialog: Jess could not care less, the quicker the better. And as he
text: heads over to her, she steals one more longing look at Nicky.
text: Something catches her eye beside his head. A metal PEN from
text: Nicky’s pocket.
text: An idea as Owens approaches ominously behind her. She
text: reaches for it with her bound hands. And as he comes to a
dialog: stop behind her--
text: SHE SWINGS AROUND and STABS him in the leg.
speaker_heading: OWENS
speaker_heading: AHHH! !
text: He drops the tray, showering Jess with the sharp metal
text: objects as he falls to his knees in pain.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: What the fuck!
text: He backhands her in a rage-- swatting her away. He pulls out
text: the pen and grumbles through gritted teeth.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want him to fucking die?!
text: Jess is flummoxed by his words-- WHICH ARE SUDDENLY SPOKEN IN
text: AN AMERICAN ACCENT. His Welsh accent is GONE.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t you know anything?
text: Owens rummages through the tools on the ground-- finding an
text: OIL INJECTOR (basically a large SYRINGE) and turning his
dialog: attention to Nicky’s wound--
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: What kind of piker are you? You
dialog: never heard of a Toledo Panic
dialog: Button? Didn’t he tell you I was
dialog: inside?
text: Jess is absolutely speechless. She can only shake her head.
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Jesus- you must be terrified.
dialog: Must’ve shaved a decade off your
dialog: life with panic...
text: He flips Nicky on his side, rips open his shirt around the
text: exit wound. He tears off some DUCT TAPE and covers the hole.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: You shoot between the third and
text: fourth rib. About eleven O’clock of
text: the left nipple. It misses the
text: heart, all the major arteries.
dialog: Just punctures the lung. Works most
dialog: of the time. Well, fifty five
text: percent of the time. Probabilistic.
text: He flips Nicky on his back and tapes shut the entry wound.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Untreated, you’ve got ten minutes
text: tops before he drowns in his own
dialog: blood.
text: He STICKS the blunt injector needle through the tape and
text: DRAWS BACK the PLUNGER. It fills with BLOOD.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: But patch it up and account for the
dialog: cavity pressure...
text: He PULLS THE PLUNGER OUT completely and--
text: SPLRT-WHOOOOSH. The blood clears as air rushes out of
text: Nicky’s chest cavity.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: +..you got about two hours to get
text: to a hospital.
text: GASP. With a thunderous rush, Nicky DRAWS A MAMMOTH BREATH-
text: filling his lungs with blessed air.
text: Jess fills with hope.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Nicky!
text: Owens beams.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: There’s my boy.... there we go.
dialog: 127.
text: Owens replaces the plunger in the syringe, equalizing the
text: pressure. As Nicky takes a few more breaths, Owens quickly
text: cuts Jess loose.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep an eye on that. Pull the
text: plunger if he can’t breathe.
text: She scrambles to Nicky, scooping him into her arms. He’s by
text: no means in good shape, but he’s alive.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You're alive... you’re alive...
text: Nicky manages his first pained words.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Fuck you Dad!
text: Jess can’t believe her ears.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: (to Nicky)
dialog: Language boy- I just saved your
dialog: life!
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You couldn’t have shot them
dialog: instead?
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: And have the whole world rain down
dialog: on my head? This was your mess!
dialog: You pay for it. Three years I was
dialog: on the inside! For what? So you
dialog: could blow it to make cow eyes with
dialog: some race skank?
speaker_heading: NICKY JESS
dialog: She is NOT a race skank!! I am NOT a race skank!!
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: I brought you in. You said you
dialog: could handle it. I should have
dialog: known with all your talk of regret
dialog: and ennui that you were gimped.
dialog: Live and learn I say.
text: He extends a hand to Jess with a big smile.
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m Bucky by the way.
text: She shakes.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Pleasure.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: I like you. You can take a punch.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Thanks.
text: A moment of calm. Owens looks at the nearby duffels.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Well there it is, the ill gotten
dialog: gain...
dialog: (then)
dialog: We gotta get him to the hospital
text: before that other lung fills up
dialog: with blood.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES SEDAN - DAWN
text: Owens drives as Jess tends to Nicky in the back seat.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: I’ve been working for this prick
dialog: Spaniard for three years. He’s got
text: a guy at McEwen and he doesn’t tell
dialog: me? What the hell happened to
dialog: trust?
dialog: (self-scolding)
dialog: Should have seen it. Sloppy. You
dialog: can be many things in this game but
dialog: sloppy ain’t one of them. Time to
dialog: get out.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: It was a hell of con though. Sorry
dialog: we messed it up.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Beaut wasn’t it?
dialog: (then)
dialog: You know what the hard part was?
dialog: The hard part wasn’t getting him to
dialog: hire a con man.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no- the hard part was getting
dialog: him to think it was his idea to
dialog: hire a con man. Ah, fuck it-- the
dialog: hard part was not laughing. Too
dialog: rich.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You can’t con an honest man. Ever
dialog: heard that? They gotta have
dialog: larceny in their heart. Isn’t that
dialog: right Nicholas?
text: Nicky, bleary, nods.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Larceny in their heart. This guy’s
dialog: heart was black with the stuff. Low
dialog: hanging fruit.
text: He pulls over, parking across the street from a HOSPITAL. He
text: glances in the mirror at Jess and Nicky, happy together.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: This life is no place for
dialog: lovebirds. There’s no happiness
dialog: here with that. Just think about
dialog: this honey-- you tricked my boy.
dialog: That’s no small feat. But the con
dialog: you pulled wasn’t for money. It was
dialog: for love. Now you got me choked up.
dialog: But this game is about the money
dialog: and if you’re not into that you
dialog: need to move to the land of the
dialog: regular people. Where trust isn’t a
dialog: tool to get you rich or get you
dialog: laid... it’s where trust is
dialog: everything.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s all you got and all you’1ll
dialog: ever have. And like it or not,
dialog: that’s who you are now. Both of
dialog: you.
text: Another glance in rear view. They seem okay with his
text: assessment. It softens him a touch.
speaker_heading: OWENS (CONT'D)
dialog: But look at you two. In love. It’s
dialog: a beautiful thing.
dialog: (he turns to them)
dialog: But I’m taking the money. All of
dialog: it.
text: Nicky doesn’t seem surprised as Owens gets out of the car and
text: pops the trunk.
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: That’s Dad...
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Well that explains you...
text: Nicky smiles.
text: KNOCK KNOCK. Owens raps on the window. Jess rolls it down
text: to reveal his curmudegeonly face.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: I‘1l see you at Christmas.
text: He walks off with the two duffle bags of cash and disappears
text: into the gloam.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - DAWN
text: MUSIC as Jess shoulders Nicky’s weight as they walk across
dialog: the street.
text: As they shuffle along, they seem strangely happy. Well
dialog: suited, content.
text: They head to the hospital. They head for the future. In love.
text: A GLINT catches Nicky’s eye. He looks to Jess’ wrist:
text: It's Garriga’s watch.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
