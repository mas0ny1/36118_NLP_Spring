scene_heading: INT. PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: The flicker of film. Footage from a press conference.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: You kill your film several times,
text: mostly by talking about it. A film is
dialog: a dream. You kill it writing it down,
dialog: you kill it with a camera; the film
dialog: might come to life for a moment or two
dialog: when your actors breathe life back
text: into it - but then it dies again,
text: buried in film cans. Mysteriously,
text: sometimes, in the editing room, a
dialog: miracle happens when you place one
dialog: image next to another so that when,
text: finally, an audience sits in the dark,
dialog: if you're lucky -- very lucky - and
dialog: sometimes I've been lucky - the dream
text: flickers back to life again. That's
dialog: why I'm secretive.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (O.S.)
dialog: So what's your favorite pasta?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
text: Finally, a serious question.
text: Laughter. A word:
speaker_heading: NINE
scene_heading: INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - NIGHT
text: A huge soundstage. The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a
text: man into the stage, turns on a working light.
dialog: SUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965
scene_heading: STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT
dialog: Good luck, Maestro.
text: Departing, he closes the soundstage door.
text: As the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of
text: light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard.
dialog: GUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the
text: world. In front of him:
scene_heading: AN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under
text: construction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its
text: unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins.
text: Cracked stone facades, broken columns, open
text: platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase. A
text: lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane
text: surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands.
dialog: p. 2
text: Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts
text: on his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the
text: stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping
text: over to the crane.
text: Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his
text: mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in
text: every sense a jumble of ideas.
text: Guido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the
text: bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands,
dialog: overwhelmed.
text: THE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES
speaker_heading: GUIDO (V.O.)
dialog: Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini...
dialog: How do you begin? How do you begin
dialog: this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page
dialog: 1... Page nothing...
text: In the distance, a figure approaches out of the
text: darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An
text: escape from his tortured reality.
text: The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is
text: gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his
text: film star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she
text: stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face,
text: and kisses him. And with that gesture, the music
text: swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the
text: air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something
text: beautiful, transforms into the interior world of
scene_heading: GUIDO'S FANTASY.
text: As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly
text: appear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the
text: women from Guido's life, past and present. Women from
dialog: his films, women he has loved, the sources of his
dialog: inspiration and creative genius.
text: A grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women
text: in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own
dialog: powerful entrance:
dialog: LUISA, his wife
dialog: CARLA, his mistress
text: LILLI, his costume designer and accomplice
dialog: GUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit
text: STEPHANIE, a fashion journalist
dialog: SARAGHINA, a whore
dialog: p. 3
text: A dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guido
text: and he loses himself and his anxiety in their
text: collective embrace.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY
text: The fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE,
text: as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting
text: Guido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight
text: penetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks,
text: discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures
text: approach with purpose. One of the figures is a well-
text: fed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime
text: associate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure
text: accompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an
text: accountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious
dialog: punctuation:
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: (walking)
dialog: Guido! You're here.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Buongiorno, Dante.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: I've been looking for you all over the
dialog: place. The set's coming along. How
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Bene, grazie, bene.
text: Guido stands to greet him. They kiss on both cheeks.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Bene. My God, you look terrible,
dialog: better go to makeup, forget you've got
dialog: a press conference?
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: (discreetly, to Dante)
dialog: He has no tie.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Yes, makeup and wardrobe.
text: He takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight.
text: Guido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a look
text: and a gesture asks Dante who is he?
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: (overlapping Dante)
dialog: Signor Contini, I'm Fausto. Good
dialog: morning, Signor Contini.
dialog: p. 4
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: He's counting costs, you know. The
dialog: Bank wants him here.
dialog: (to Fausto)
dialog: Don't speak to him, I speak to him.
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: Okay, I have some questions for Signor
dialog: Contini.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: We all have questions for Signor
dialog: Contini.
text: They head outside.
scene_heading: EXT. CINECITTA - DAY
text: Guido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en
text: route to the Production Offices. Behind them is a large
text: poster of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, a
text: failure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guido
text: passes he causes a mild stir, and many people nod
text: deferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: Yes, but please, please, I think it's
dialog: customary for there to be an approved
dialog: script and budget before filming
dialog: commences...
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Is he going to follow us?
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: It's not my intention to be difficult.
dialog: Maestro, I am a huge admirer of
dialog: Maestro Contini's movies, your early
dialog: films are...everybody loves them
dialog: and... I consider it a great honour
dialog: for me to be here now... none the
dialog: less, I need a script and a budget.
text: Neither Dante nor Guido respond. Fausto flounders.
text: They make their way to the Production Offices.
text: Everywhere signs for the movie, ITALIA.
scene_heading: INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY
text: A long corridor, bustling with activity. The trio
text: heads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there are
text: several, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without
text: missing a beat of their solemn conversation.
dialog: p. 5
text: As they progress into and through the open plan office,
text: many of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to
text: get Guido's attention, swelling the procession,
text: interjecting with their urgent requests.
text: There are set models everywhere, in the process of
dialog: being constructed, or painted.
text: JACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a
text: model, hurries over. Nobody stops moving.
text: As a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to
dialog: look.
text: PIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the
text: procession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting
text: through them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a
dialog: partitioned office -
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: Where do you want your messages?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: On my desk.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: There's no room on your desk.
dialog: - into the main office -
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo
dialog: so.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: (waving them at him)
dialog: Some of these are urgent!
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (to Pierpaolo)
dialog: Get me a cigarette.
speaker_heading: JACONELLI
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: We will never be ready to shoot in ten
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Jaconelli -
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: (at the same time)
dialog: Not ready?!
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (continues)
dialog: Ascolta me.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: p. 6
speaker_heading: GUIDO (CONT'D)
text: (he kisses Jaconelli on
dialog: the cheek)
dialog: Careful what you say. He's a spy from
dialog: the bank.
text: Guido carries on moving through the office.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: He's not exactly from the bank, Guido.
text: Now BENITO, Guido's Casting Director, moves towards
text: Guido, Guido tries to duck away from him as they head
text: towards Guido's office.
speaker_heading: BENITO
dialog: Dottore, Dottore. You have actors
dialog: waiting for you in your office.
dialog: Auditions all morning. You should see
dialog: what I've found. I found two sisters.
dialog: Look, they're right...
text: Guido turns through another partition, as they all
text: besiege him with questions. Benito despairs.
speaker_heading: BENITO (CONT'D)
dialog: Dottore, this way...
text: Guido heads towards Wardrobe, goes straight through the
text: door, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him.
text: Dante blocks Benito.
speaker_heading: BENITO (CONT'D)
dialog: Maestro!
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Not now. He's got the Press
dialog: Conference.
scene_heading: INT. WARDROBE, CINECITTA - DAY
text: Guido comes through the door, blows hard from the
dialog: barrage.
dialog: They're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always,
dialog: for Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is
text: Guido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky,
text: indomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without
dialog: any sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido
text: heads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting
text: some fabric.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I need a cigarette.
text: Dante comes in, closing the door behind him.
dialog: p. 7
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli.
text: Guido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to
text: Lilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I need a coffee and a cigarette.
text: He lies down.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: (unimpressed)
dialog: Answer a question, I'll give you a
dialog: coffee. Answer another question, I'll
dialog: give you a cigarette. And so on.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
text: Actually and an aspirin.
text: Dante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some
dialog: drawings.
speaker_heading: DANTE
text: (in the background, on the
dialog: phone)
dialog: We're running late...
speaker_heading: LILLI
text: (turns to Guido and lights
dialog: a cigarette)
dialog: Calm down. Directing a movie is a very
dialog: overrated job, we all know it. You
dialog: just have to say yes or no. What else
dialog: do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should
dialog: this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More
dialog: extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes,
dialog: no, yes, no, yes, no - that's
dialog: directing.
text: Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: That's right: that's directing. And it
dialog: doesn't seem to make a blind bit of
dialog: difference, finally, what the answer
dialog: is...
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: So please, Guido, yes or no, do you
dialog: want any costumes in this film?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Yes.
dialog: p. 8
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: You see - simple!
text: (handing him an espresso
text: fetched by her assistant,
speaker_heading: ROBERTA)
dialog: Might I know what period the movie's
dialog: in?
text: Lilli glances at Dante who has edged closer to the
text: table, he looks at the costumes.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Yes, yes.
dialog: (downs the espresso)
dialog: Soon.
text: Lilli glares at Dante, ushering him away.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: You know I don't allow producers in
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Alright. Two minutes Guido.
text: Lilli is the only person who intimidates Dante. He
text: leaves. Guido pulls out his own tie from his pocket.
text: Lilli walks round and takes the tie off him. Guido sits
text: up. Lilli puts the tie round his neck.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: He's gone. Have you written a word of
dialog: the script?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: Are you in a panic?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Yes.
text: She ties Guido's tie for him.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: Is Luisa going with you to the Press
dialog: Conference?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: No. Nobody. Dante. And his spy.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: You need to shave. You look terrible.
dialog: p. 9
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (looking around,
dialog: desperate)
dialog: Why is there no fire escape in here?
dialog: What if somebody needed to escape? I
dialog: can't face these reporters. I have
dialog: nothing to say.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: You'll be fine. You're a world class
dialog: liar, darling, go out there and lie
dialog: for Italy, lie for Italia.
scene_heading: EXT. ROME - DAY
text: Guido is driving his Roadster through the streets of
text: Rome. An Italian pop song of the day is playing on the
text: radio as he speeds around the Piazza del Poppolo. In
text: front of him in the convoy is Dante with Fausto.
scene_heading: INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY
text: As Guido drives, he turns to see his MAMMA in the
text: passenger seat. He's not remotely surprised. She
text: appears the way he remembers her. Mamma is
dialog: extraordinary.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: What the hell's wrong with me? I
dialog: can't sleep. I can't think. I can't
dialog: write. I can't breathe. My heart is
dialog: racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you
dialog: flowers, I know. I'll come to the
dialog: cemetery at the weekend. You should
dialog: have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I
dialog: could visit you every week. Don't
dialog: look at me like that.
speaker_heading: MAMMA
dialog: (with kindly patience)
dialog: Oh, Guido, Guido.
text: He stops at a busy intersection.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF ROME / INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY
text: This is the Rome of La Dolce Vita, the Rome of Vespas,
text: skinny ties, cool sunglasses, impossibly cool young
text: people. A magnificent fall day, and the cafes are
text: stuffed with the beautiful and chic.
dialog: p. 10
speaker_heading: MAMMA
dialog: This is your Rome, Guido. The world
dialog: sees Rome the way you invented it.
dialog: Your films did that.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (buoyed by her
dialog: encouragement)
dialog: I miss you.
speaker_heading: MAMMA
dialog: I miss you, too.
text: Guido is in his own world. The policeman raps on the
text: bonnet of the car. Guido startles and pulls off, alone
text: in the car.
text: Guido looks across as he drives. Mamma has gone.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL EXCELSIOR, VIA VENETO - DAY
text: The convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the Hotel
text: Excelsior on the Via Veneto.
text: As soon as Guido gets out of the car, the waiting
text: paparazzi snap his picture. Beautiful women look at
text: him. Guido moves quickly by them.
text: Dante and the team hurry after him. Fausto tackles
dialog: Dante.
text: And they hurry after Guido.
scene_heading: INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY
text: A big suite. About fifty reporters, men and women, are
text: in the room, and an array of microphones are on a
text: coffee table next to a long couch. Excited chaos. A
text: RADIO REPORTER narrates in the background.
speaker_heading: RADIO REPORTER
dialog: And we're just waiting for the arrival
dialog: of Contini...any moment now - Could
dialog: this film put the Maestro back on top?
text: A few news cameras are filming. There's a buffet, and
text: a bartender.
text: And Guido comes into the room, shaking hands, patting
text: shoulders, grabbing a glass of champagne. Dante and the
text: team follow him in.
speaker_heading: RADIO REPORTER (CONT'D)
dialog: And here he is..!
dialog: p. 11
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Silenzio, per favore...Thank you,
dialog: thank you...
speaker_heading: RADIO REPORTER
dialog: Dante, Guido Contini's long time
text: producer, is about to speak...
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: I want to say a few words from my
dialog: heart. I am humbled and thrilled to
dialog: be able to announce that I am
dialog: producing Guido Contini's next film,
dialog: Italia, which will star once again
dialog: Contini's longtime inspiration, the
dialog: international film star, Claudia
dialog: Jenssen...
text: A stunning film poster is revealed -- Claudia Jenssen
scene_heading: emerging from the Colosseum: CLAUDIA JENSSEN. UN FILM
scene_heading: DI GUIDO CONTINI. ITALIA. Flashes. Excitement.
speaker_heading: DANTE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...we start shooting in ten days time
dialog: in Cinecitta. That makes it one week
dialog: from Monday.
dialog: (to Guido, handing over)
dialog: Thank you, Maestro, thank you very
dialog: much. This is our ninth film
dialog: together. Guido Contini.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Thanks for coming, everybody.
text: Pretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and
text: kisses Dante on the cheek.
text: He returns to the couch. All the reporters fire their
text: questions at once. The questions come on top of each
text: other, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated
text: energy. He takes his sunglasses off and signals to
text: DINARDO, a harsh-looking woman.
speaker_heading: DINARDO
dialog: Maestro Contini. Maestro Contini.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DINARDO
dialog: Grazie. Maestro Contini, your new
dialog: film is called Italia... big title.
text: Another journalist, Leopardi, vile - sitting next to
text: her, egging Dinardo on - almost sniggers with contempt.
dialog: p. 12
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Actually, it's my shortest title yet.
speaker_heading: DINARDO
dialog: But hardly a modest one.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Films are not modest. They cost too
dialog: much, they take too long, and they
dialog: involve too many people. So they
dialog: should have grand titles.
speaker_heading: DINARDO
dialog: And might you tell the press what the
dialog: film is about?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Why? I still don't know what my last
dialog: film was about.
speaker_heading: LEOPARDI
dialog: (In a loud aside to
dialog: Dinardo)
dialog: That was the problem. Nobody else did.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Of course I can tell you what my film
dialog: is about...I can tell you the story, I
dialog: can tell you who I am going to cast,
dialog: the music I want to use, I can tell
dialog: you everything... but... I... won't.
dialog: I'm afraid that if I say anything, the
dialog: word might get out to the Press.
text: General laughter in the room. He wins a round, but is
text: clearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, steps
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Our next film will be exactly as it
dialog: sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit
dialog: of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a
dialog: woman, Italy as a dream.
speaker_heading: LEOPARDI
dialog: Is this true?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: It sounds fantastic. I can't wait to
dialog: see it.
text: He's still winning. Ignoring the question, he points
text: to STEPHANIE, a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes
text: from American Vogue. Flirtatious and charming, she
text: wants him and he senses it.
dialog: p. 13
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Signor Contini.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Stephanie.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Grazie. Could you tell the fashionable
dialog: women of America who your favorite
dialog: designer is this year?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I'm less interested in the wrapping
dialog: than what might be inside it.
speaker_heading: REPORTER ONE
dialog: Signor Contini! You're a man of the
dialog: world, yes? Educated in Britain, a
dialog: home in Biarritz. With Italia is it
dialog: fair to say that you've come home for
dialog: good?
speaker_heading: REPORTER TWO (O.S.)
dialog: (tries to interrupt)
dialog: What do you think of the New Wave in
dialog: the French Cinema?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: For good?
speaker_heading: REPORTER FOUR
dialog: It's been a long time since you made a
dialog: movie with your wife, do you plan on
dialog: casting her in this new film?
text: Guido is spinning plates.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I told Luisa that when we got married
dialog: I would never again make love to my
dialog: leading lady.
speaker_heading: REPORTER FOUR
dialog: But she hasn't worked at all since
dialog: working with you.
text: Laughter. Everyone starts firing questions at Guido
text: again. Another REPORTER asks a question.
speaker_heading: REPORTER FIVE
dialog: But why are you being so tight-lipped
dialog: about this film? It's a serious
dialog: question. What's the big deal?
dialog: p. 14

scene_heading: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
text: We discover Guido, alone on the soundstage of his
text: unfinished set. A retreat into surreality. He sits on

text: Everyone waits.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: LEOPARDI
dialog: What I'm asking, Maestro, is have you

scene_heading: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
text: As the number progresses, Guido gets up from his chair

scene_heading: EXT. ROME ROAD - DAY

speaker_heading: GUIDO!

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I need a room.
speaker_heading: DE ROSSI
dialog: Of course.

speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: DE ROSSI

speaker_heading: DE ROSSI

speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: DE ROSSI
dialog: (continuing to work)
dialog: Needless to say, I love your films.

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Not the flops.
dialog: (anxious, confidential)
dialog: I need to see a doctor. Do you know

speaker_heading: DE ROSSI

scene_heading: INT. TELEPHONE KIOSK, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY

scene_heading: INT. CONTINI HOME, ROME / TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY
text: We intercut between the phone booth and LUISA in their

speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: LUISA

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Is everybody mad at me?
speaker_heading: LUISA

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I had to escape from the Press

speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: I heard. Dramatic.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Don't tease me. I'm sick, Luisa.
speaker_heading: LUISA

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: No, but this time I'm really sick. I

speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: Are you by yourself?
speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: LUISA

speaker_heading: LUISA

speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: LUISA

speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: LUISA

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (suddenly claustrophobic)
dialog: And, actually, it's hardly worth it.
dialog: I'll be home in a day or two.
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: (all too familiar )
dialog: Yes, it's hardly worth it.
speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: LUISA

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NURSE

speaker_heading: DOCTOR RONDI
dialog: Si?

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: What is she whispering? Is it my

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (to the Nurse, not

speaker_heading: DOCTOR (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. ANZIO, TRAIN STATION - DAY
text: And out of the steam... CARLA comes walking toward
text: Guido, swinging her hips, with a PORTER behind her,
text: pulling five bags on a wagon. Carla is dressed in her
dialog: own style, which is not chic, but it's what Guido
dialog: likes, a little too tight, a little flamboyant. She

speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Guido! Ciao!
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (to himself, remembering
dialog: how much work she is)
dialog: Carla.
dialog: (and now to her, covering

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: CARLA

dialog: happy?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Very happy.

speaker_heading: CARLA

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (avoiding this, looks at

dialog: Carla, all those bags for the weekend?
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Yes, the Bellavista is a very
dialog: fashionable place. You know I stayed
dialog: there with my parents, during the war,
dialog: it was full of Germans.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Carla... I have to tell you... they
dialog: found out who I am at the hotel--
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: ... yes, horrible, but obviously we
dialog: don't want to be followed by the
dialog: press, so I found the most charming
dialog: pensione for you, and it's right here.
dialog: It's charming.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Here at the station?
scene_heading: EXT. PENSIONE FERROVIA - DAY
text: A small pensione across the street from the station.
text: Carla sizes it up, and it's really not at all what she
text: was hoping for, but she doesn't say anything.
scene_heading: INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY
text: Later, Carla, in silhouette, from behind. Wrapped in a
text: sheet, she is looking out the window of the dingy room.
text: The light from the pensione's neon sign spills in. They
dialog: whisper.
speaker_heading: GUIDO (O.S.)
text: Close the curtains, it's too light in
dialog: here.
text: Carla closes the curtains. They continue to whisper.
speaker_heading: GUIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: Perfect. Now, go into the corridor---
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: What?
dialog: p. 28
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Shhh! Yes, count to ten and come back
dialog: in, and pretend you're in the wrong
dialog: room, and I'm a complete stranger--
text: Carla sits on the bed facing Guido.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I love your games!
text: She kisses him.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I'm here on business.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Go, go. Wait. Your face.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Get your makeup.
text: Guido switches on the light, puts on his glasses, and
text: tilts the lamp shade up. He begins to pencil in a
text: beauty mark and darken her eyes. He is meticulous
text: about this, and precise, and takes his time to make it
dialog: exactly as he wants it.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I had a nightmare last night. We were
dialog: in that little alley behind Piazza
dialog: Navona, where I bought you that scarf,
dialog: remember? The same one your wife
dialog: bought you--
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (probably doesn't)
dialog: Don't move, Carla.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: When you wear it, I never know if it's
dialog: hers or mine.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (not really listening)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: So we were there, on the ground,
dialog: naked, kissing, and we didn't care,
dialog: and then my husband arrived and killed
dialog: us both with a shovel! Poor Luigi!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: p. 29
speaker_heading: CARLA (CONT'D)
dialog: He would never do that! He's so sweet.
dialog: He speaks Latin! He knows all the
dialog: Roman Emperors.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (still intent on his
dialog: makeup job)
dialog: Good for him.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Perhaps there's a job for him in the
dialog: movie--
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: You could work well together.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Beautiful. When you come in I want
dialog: you to be my little savage.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (gesturing towards the
dialog: door)
dialog: Go, go.
text: Guido takes off his glasses and puts them on the side
dialog: table..
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: You think I am one of your actresses?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Hurry, please, Carla.
text: Carla gets up and takes Guido's glasses with her. Guido
text: turns out the light and settles into his pillow, for
text: the game. Carla looks at herself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Oh, Madonna!
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I'll pretend to be asleep.
text: Carla turns back to the mirror, she puts on Guido's
text: glasses and turns back to him.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: What if I really found the wrong room?
dialog: Would you be jealous?
dialog: p. 30
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Could you do such a thing?
text: Carla teases him with a look that says, "Why not?"
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: (coyly)
dialog: Hm! Who knows?
text: Carla goes into the hall and closes the door behind
text: her. We HEAR the MATRON who runs the Pensione talking
text: to her. While they talk, Guido removes a crucifix from
text: the wall and puts it in the bedside drawer.
text: Now Carla comes back into the room, giggling, signaling
dialog: for Guido to keep quiet.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: (still giggling)
text: It was the woman from the hotel. She
dialog: wanted to give me towels.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Come here.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: You are a stranger, I don't know you.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Carla, just come here.
dialog: (indicating her sheet)
dialog: Be savage. Show me.
text: She crosses the room and climbs onto the bed and opens
text: the sheet slowly, spreading her arms wide.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Excuse me! I've got the wrong room.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Yes, you have. And I don't have the
dialog: faintest idea who you are.
text: She throws herself on Guido, whose arms enfold her.
dialog: p. 31
scene_heading: INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - LATER

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

text: He walks down the hallway, alone.
speaker_heading: GUIDO (V.O.)

text: IMAGES OF CLAUDIA in his fantasy. Kissing him.
dialog: Walking away...
speaker_heading: GUIDO (V.O.)
text: She takes the man's face and kisses
dialog: him...
text: Guido is surrounded by discarded bits of paper, an
text: outline of Italia. An empty sheet of paper sits in his
text: typewriter on his desk. He is not working on the
text: outline. He is sketching a voluptuous woman...
speaker_heading: GUIDO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...And with that gesture, he's
dialog: suddenly inspired to write
dialog: something... profound.
text: ...he draws in the nipples on the woman's breasts.
text: Guido becomes discouraged. He tosses off his glasses
text: and runs his hands through his hair in frustration.
speaker_heading: GUIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: Mother of God, give me a sign.
text: He's happily distracted by the sound of vehicles

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA LOBBY - DAY
text: As Guido hurries down the stairs, the Cardinal is being

scene_heading: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
dialog: Is Claudia Jenssen with you?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: No.
scene_heading: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
text: Pity. His excellency is a big admirer

scene_heading: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
dialog: Do you think you could find a signed

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: For His Excellency?
scene_heading: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
dialog: Si.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I'm sure that would be possible...
scene_heading: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY
dialog: Truly? What a pleasure. Arrivederci,

text: He heads towards the elevator. Guido watches him go,
text: then a voice calls out his name....GUIDO! Guido can't
text: turn round. He knows that voice.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Guidino!
text: Guido hurries towards the elevator. The elevator doors
text: close. Guido is trapped.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I'm not going to ask how you found me.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Please - it's my job. A producer
dialog: needs to know where his director is at
dialog: all times...even to know the pensione
dialog: where his mistress is staying...
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Oh God.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: I understand, Guido. Rome is
text: absolutely unbearable. The pressure.
dialog: It's no good.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Really? You understand?
text: He takes Guido by the arm and leads him to a stairwell.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BELLAVISTA - STAIRCASE - DAY
speaker_heading: DANTE

speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Thank you, my old friend.

speaker_heading: DANTE

dialog: (heading towards the
dialog: ballroom)
scene_heading: INT. GRAND BALLROOM, HOTEL BELLAVISTA - DAY
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Rome will come to you!
text: Dante opens the door of the Ballroom to reveal a full
scene_heading: PRODUCTION OFFICE, ART DEPARTMENT, COSTUME DEPARTMENT,
text: CASTING OFFICE. The models, costumes, headshots,
text: everything all in place or being put into place. An

speaker_heading: DANTE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a fantastic place for you to
dialog: focus. Everyone is here to help the
dialog: movie. Everyone is here because they
dialog: love you, Guido.
text: He stands watching Guido with genuine admiration as he
text: sets to work with his team. Guido moves through the
text: room avoiding specific questions from everyone. As he
text: does so, Dante makes his way over to Guido with a
text: magnificent girl on his arm.
speaker_heading: JACONELLI

speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: LILLI

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: For which scene?
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: Well I don't know which scene until

speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: CARDINAL
dialog: Try harder.
speaker_heading: GUIDO

scene_heading: SUPERTITLE: Pesaro, Italy, 1926

text: The boys head for a graffiti-covered defensive wall
text: with barbed wire along the top, a leftover from the
dialog: war.
text: They reach into pockets and extract small change, hand

text: They crawl through a small opening in the wall and
text: approach an abandoned bunker...
scene_heading: EXT. SARAGHINA'S BUNKER - DAY
text: ...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker,

dialog: (loudest)
dialog: Saraghina! Sa-ra-ghina!
text: A shadow moves inside the bunker. Now even Young Guido
text: takes a step back, but the boys are taking three steps
dialog: back.
text: And then she comes out. SARAGHINA is a gritty, earthy
text: woman, with a powerful, voluptuous energy. She has
text: darkened eyes and a beauty mark: she is clearly the
text: model for the whore makeup on Carla.
text: She looks at the boys. She may be a crazy whore, but
text: she's not an animal, she's just playing one for the
text: boys, and they don't quite understand that she's having
dialog: her own fun with them.
text: She takes a deliberate step. Young Guido stands his
text: ground. She takes another step and holds out her hand.
dialog: p. 44
text: Young Guido opens his hand with the coins.
text: She looks at the money. Is it enough?
text: But she grabs his wrist, and holds it, and then takes
dialog: the coins.
text: She stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back
text: to her bunker. She returns dragging an old broken
text: chair, places it in front of the boys and sits, ready
dialog: for the "show."

scene_heading: INT. PENSIONE BEDROOM - DAY
text: ...and the cry is now in Guido's mouth, on top of Carla

speaker_heading: CARLA

dialog: Guido. Everybody knows about me. Why?
dialog: Why won't you let me near you?

speaker_heading: CARLA

speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Because it's true.
text: Luisa turns on her bedside lamp and sits up in bed.
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: You told me it was finished.
speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: GUIDO (CONT'D)

dialog: What? What are you laughing about?
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: Nothing. If you could see yourself.
dialog: (raising herself up
dialog: further)
dialog: I couldn't live with it - the
dialog: absurdity of being you, the effort of
dialog: having to hide and lie and cheat. It's
dialog: exhausting, no wonder you've got no

speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: And what truth is that?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: (thinks)

speaker_heading: GUIDO

scene_heading: INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - DAY
text: The door is open as Guido enters. He's confused,
text: worried that Luisa has gone, perhaps. But then he sees
text: a figure moving about in the dressing room, emptying a
dialog: closet.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Darling?
text: Dante appears, stuffing Guido's things into a suitcase.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: We're going back to Rome.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (anxious)
dialog: Where's Luisa?
speaker_heading: DANTE
text: Luisa? She's gone. She's had it with
dialog: you.
dialog: (different tone)
dialog: And quite frankly, so have I. You
dialog: drag a whole crew up here and then you

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: p. 70
speaker_heading: DANTE (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't protect you anymore. And
text: Claudia is in Rome. Makeup tests start
dialog: today. Remember?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (sits)
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: You can't. You must. Don't sit down.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I need help.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: (still packing)
dialog: You've had help. You've seen the
dialog: doctors, you've seen the priests,
dialog: you've taken the cure.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I'm not cured.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: (decisive, no arguments)
dialog: That's enough! The movie calls, your
dialog: star has landed. Fausto - take his
dialog: things please.
text: Dante walks over to the door with the suitcase, passing
text: Fausto. A Bellboy and a luggage cart stand in the hall.
speaker_heading: DANTE (CONT'D)
dialog: (impatient,
dialog: at the door)
dialog: Guido! Andiamo!
scene_heading: EXT. GATES OF CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Guido's Roadster approaches the gates. There are
dialog: PAPARAZZI gathered for the arrival of Claudia, for the
text: beginning of filming. They drive through, solemn faced,
text: ignoring the press.
speaker_heading: GUIDO (O.S.)
dialog: I need more time.
speaker_heading: DANTE (O.S.)
dialog: Forget the script. Claudia's here now.
dialog: She'll inspire you to do what you do
dialog: best, write with your camera.
dialog: p. 71
scene_heading: EXT. CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The whole energy of this return to Cinecitta is hectic,
text: people wanting to work, equipment waiting to work,
text: everybody and everything needing Guido's attention.
text: Guido drives towards the stages. Guido feels the
text: pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a
dialog: movie that doesn't exist.
text: Guido is trying not to panic. He feels as if he's just
text: arrived in prison camp. He drives fast and straight to
text: Stage 4, and as they head towards the studio, they are
text: immediately swamped. Pierpaolo has a hundred requests
dialog: for Guido...
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
text: Maestro, the screen tests are back
dialog: from the lab. Will you watch them now?
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Tonight. We'll watch everything
dialog: tonight and make some decisions.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: Design meeting? Production meeting?
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Tonight.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: Tonight.
text: Dante marches Guido towards the stage. Lilli joins
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: Claudia says where are you? She's in
text: fine form. Feisty.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (knows what that means)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: She asked if she could read my script
dialog: as she didn't have one. I said I
dialog: didn't quite have mine.
text: Lilli peels off and joins her assistant Roberta at a
text: rack of costumes.
dialog: p. 72
scene_heading: INT. INSERT STAGE, CINECITTA - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A couple of huge cameras are being prepared, some
text: lights are being flown up into the grid, the LOADER is
text: preparing the Clapper Board. The Loader has created a
scene_heading: slate: ITALIA, CLAUDIA JENSSEN, HAIR AND MAKEUP TESTS.
text: The gang enters. Guido says a brisk hello to the crew,
text: then leaves the set quickly. Finds the studio
text: telephone behind the flats. He dials.
text: Guido waits. Luisa picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: Pronto.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up.
dialog: (she doesn't respond)
dialog: I want you to be with me in the
dialog: screening room tonight. I want to talk
dialog: to you about the casting, about the
dialog: script. Everything...
scene_heading: INT. INSERT STAGE/CONTINI HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
text: INTERCUT, LUISA at home, listening, inscrutable.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Otherwise I won't be able to start, I
dialog: won't know what I'm thinking...
text: Luisa listens. Pierpaolo appears again, always the
dialog: same, needs him to start.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: Maestro.
text: Guido nods, waves him away.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Are you there? Luisa?
speaker_heading: LUISA
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I'm not asking you to let me come
dialog: home, I just want you to come to the
dialog: screen test tonight. Not for me, but
dialog: for the movie. You always have, you
dialog: always do.
text: Luisa puts down the phone.
dialog: p. 73
text: Guido is in a mess.
scene_heading: INT. INSERT STAGE - EARLY EVENING
text: Guido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly
text: there's a commotion at the studio door, and Lilli and
text: some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only,
text: followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around
text: her. As the others walk towards a holding area with
text: costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman,
text: who is CLAUDIA, of course, simply walks into the light,
text: her home, and stands there waiting for Guido.
text: She looks stunning and glamorous. The epitome of a
text: Sixties movie star. Guido gets up and approaches
dialog: Claudia.
text: Pierpaolo acts as First Assistant Director.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: Silence please. Se gira. And we are
dialog: rolling.
text: Guido gets behind the camera and films Claudia's test.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Could you turn to the right please,
dialog: Claudia.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: Yes, I can turn to my right.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: And can you turn to the left.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: Yes, I can turn to my left.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Now just one slow turn for us.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: (she turns around)
dialog: Okay, one slow turn.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Bellissima. Brava. Cut.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: We've got it. Next costume please.
text: Makeup artists and costume assistants immediately
text: surround her, loosening her hair.
text: Dante is thrilled. Fausto is also mesmerised. She's a
dialog: star, that's the long and short of it.
dialog: p. 74
text: And she's warming up for a fight with her director.
text: Another litany of jibes, half-joking, but dangerous.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: Has anybody got a script? Script
dialog: missing, handsome reward.... Lost, one
dialog: script, title Italia. Can't make a
dialog: film without it...
text: Lilli comes forward, puts a chinchilla fur coat on
text: Claudia, adjusts her hair.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
dialog: So interesting to do hair and makeup
dialog: for a part when you don't know what
dialog: the part is.
text: Guido adores her, her spirit, her feistiness.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
dialog: (shrugs off the coat)
dialog: No! I'm going back to my hotel now.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: (anxious)
dialog: But please, just a couple more
dialog: costumes, Claudia.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: (to Guido)
dialog: I'm going back to my hotel now, my
dialog: darling, and when I there is a script,
dialog: I'll read it and then we'll take it
dialog: from there.
dialog: (calls over to Lilli)
dialog: I love the costumes, Lilli. They are
dialog: beautiful.
dialog: (back to the guys,
dialog: sweetly)
dialog: Ciao Bello.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: That's fair.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Claudia!
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (to Dante)
dialog: That's fair.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Fair?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I'll be back.
dialog: p. 75
text: Guido races after Claudia, taking the chinchilla coat
text: from Lilli with him. Opportunity for escape.
speaker_heading: DANTE

dialog: You've got dailies, Guido.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I'll be right back.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: You've got meetings.
scene_heading: EXT. CINECITTA - NIGHT
text: Guido drives Claudia towards the gates, which swing
text: open. The paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car,
text: flashbulbs popping, men clambering onto the car for a
text: picture of the Star driving away with her Director.
text: Lots of shouting and pleas, lots of remonstration from
text: Guido. They drive away, and are immediately followed
text: by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas
dialog: and little cars.
scene_heading: INT. CAR, ROME OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
text: Guido's Roadster roars away, the papparazzi posse
text: following. Guido glances at Claudia, loves having her
dialog: in the car, she's such a class act. He's always
text: inspired. He's driving fast but distracted by her.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: You look ravishing.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: You're not seeing me, you're seeing
dialog: Lilli's wigs and makeup, I'm somewhere
text: hidden underneath.
text: Guido's a good driver and weaves in and out of the
text: traffic. So do the posse, but as the road opens up,
text: they can't keep up with him and he manages to overtake
text: a car, they speed after him.
scene_heading: EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT
text: Guido stops the car by some narrow streets in the
text: Trastevere, just south of the Vatican. They watch the
text: photographers hurtle past in search of them.
text: They sit for a second.
dialog: p. 76
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: It's good to see you.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: I'm assuming that's code for there's
dialog: no script.
text: Guido is exasperated.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed
dialog: with the script?
text: Claudia listens. She's always seduced by the way he
text: speaks, his passion. They fall in love with each other
dialog: in every movie, that's the way of it. Guido lights a
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: GUIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: Talk to the people who love you in our
dialog: films, they're not interested in my
dialog: script! They're interested in the way
dialog: you turn your head, the way the camera
dialog: looks past you to the moon... the way
dialog: you smile a little as you cry, the way
dialog: you really do blush for the camera -
dialog: how?! -
dialog: (enough examples, sighs)
dialog: who even knows, but whatever else it
dialog: is, it's not my script.
text: Guido has no confidence in what he's saying anymore.
text: They get out of the car and begin to walk away. It's
text: almost deserted here.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: So Lilli says I'm playing a million
dialog: different parts -
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Not a million - you're the muses, the
dialog: incredible women who made Italy what
dialog: it is today, a country run by men -
dialog: who are themselves run by women,
dialog: whether they know it or not.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: (teasing him)
dialog: So I'm the women behind the great men?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (trying hard to tell the
dialog: truth)
dialog: The great women...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: p. 77
speaker_heading: GUIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: In a way - yes - you have this man in
dialog: the story and he's, he wants to take
dialog: hold of everything, to devour
dialog: everything, he can't let anything go,
dialog: or, he doesn't want to, and he changes
dialog: direction every day, because he's
text: lost, he's dying, he's bleeding to
dialog: death...
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: (deflating)
text: And these muses - they fall in love
dialog: with the man?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
text: Exactly! They fall in love with him.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: (decisive)
dialog: I'd rather be the man.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: I'd rather be the man.
text: She grabs his hat, puts it on her head. Saunters down

scene_heading: EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA

speaker_heading: CLAUDIA

dialog: YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO TO ME.
dialog: YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE.
dialog: YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME
dialog: LOOKING AT YOU.
text: IT SCARES ME SO THAT I CAN HARDLY
text: SPEAK.
scene_heading: EXT. MEDIEVAL LANES, TRASTEVERE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: GUIDO

speaker_heading: CLAUDIA

speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I fall in love with you every time.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
text: When there's a camera between us.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: It's not a real person, Guido.

speaker_heading: CLAUDIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
text: IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY,
dialog: I OWE WHAT I AM TO YOU.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT
text: Claudia heads towards a little Piazza with an ancient
text: fountain in the centre of the square. The Piazza is
text: empty except for a few cars parked where the entrances
text: have been blocked off. Claudia steps up onto the
dialog: fountain.
dialog: p. 79
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: There was a time once, we were on
dialog: location, some terrible hotel - and
dialog: you were in the room directly above me
dialog: and I could hear you walking about...
text: Guido sits down at the edge of the fountain.
speaker_heading: GUIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: ...and, all through the night, I
dialog: wanted to rush up the stairs and
dialog: hammer on your door until you opened.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: And why didn't you?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I don't know. I don't know.
scene_heading: INT. "SOUNDSTAGE"
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
text: SPECIAL TO ME IN MY LIFE,

text: IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY,
dialog: YOU'VE MADE ME WHOLE.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT
text: Claudia leaves behind the hat on the fountain and moves
text: closer to Guido. The music continues.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA
dialog: Maybe you should have knocked, maybe
dialog: you should have knocked me right off
dialog: the pedestal. I can't do this
dialog: anymore.
text: She takes off her wig and diamond earrings.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
dialog: This is me. And you have a wife who
dialog: loves you.
text: She hands him the wig and the earrings. She kisses
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll miss you. Wrong girl.
text: The music ends. Claudia turns and walks away.
dialog: p. 80
scene_heading: INT. SCREENING ROOM, CINECITTA - NIGHT
text: A screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting
text: down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the
text: screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup
text: test. People start to comment, all enthusiastically.
text: Guido gets a cigarette off Pierpaolo and lights up.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: (to Lilli)
dialog: Great work, Lilli... Wonderful
dialog: costume...
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: ...and the hair, makeup, fantastic.
text: Guido watches, sitting alone, he turns around as he
text: sees someone come in the door, but it's Gianluca, not
dialog: Luisa.
speaker_heading: BENITO
text: She has a beautiful profile.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Two great profiles.
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: She's a goddess.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: And the back isn't too bad.
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: She came directly from Venus.
dialog: Beautiful.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Fantastic. Guido? Really nice.
dialog: Who's next?
speaker_heading: BENITO
dialog: Actresses.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Okay. Let's see the actresses.
text: The reel finishes. The lights come up, to excited
text: chatter, he looks at Lilli a row or two behind him, she
text: shrugs sympathetically.
text: The room goes dark, the next reel begins. Guido turns
text: back to look at the screen.
dialog: p. 81
text: During the reel, Dante is very decisive... shouts out,
text: as the women appear.
text: They come on, one after the other, say their names.
text: Guido gives them things to do. Pick up the phone and
dialog: argue with your lover. No, make him laugh. Make him
dialog: want you. Walk towards the camera as if you were
text: frightened. As if you were angry. ON ELEANORA - very
dialog: angry on the phone:
speaker_heading: BENITO
dialog: If we like her, we have to call her
dialog: agent right away. Everybody wants her
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Well they can keep her.
speaker_heading: BENITO
dialog: She's a very funny actress.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: She's peculiar. You don't like her
dialog: Guido?
text: Next actress: ILARIA. Someone comes in the door.
text: Guido turns and sees it's Luisa, sitting next to Lilli.
text: She's come. He turns back to the screen.
text: Another actress appears. It's Donatella. Very
text: nervous. She says her name. Guido instructs her. She
text: tries the phone, the walks. She's not a natural.
text: Luisa finds the gentle humor in this situation. She
text: looks at Guido. A little smile. He feels it like
text: sunshine. He turns back to the screen.
speaker_heading: DANTE (CONT'D)
dialog: She's nice.
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: She's very natural.
speaker_heading: DANTE
text: Even better. She's a bit nervous
dialog: here. What do you say, Guido?
dialog: Donatella's nice?
text: Another girl: ALESSIA. Very striking. Keeps looking
text: out past the camera, getting sotto voce instructions
text: from Guido. Her hair is in a chignon. She begins her
text: improv, but Guido interrupts her, suddenly appears in
text: front of the camera. Approaches her, and undoes the
text: chignon, freeing her hair. She's beautiful and
text: innocent. Guido says something to her, a whisper. But
text: what he says and how he says it, the smile it provokes,
text: goes like a dagger to Luisa.
dialog: p. 82
speaker_heading: DANTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's this? I thought we were looking
text: for a blonde.
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
text: She's too tall.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Very tall.
speaker_heading: BENITO
dialog: She's very beautiful.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: It's not the point. Guido wants the
dialog: blonde.
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: She's not bad, but -
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: Shh.
speaker_heading: FAUSTO
dialog: She's beautiful.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: She's too beautiful. For my tastes.
text: As the reel finishes... and the lights come up.
speaker_heading: DANTE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what Guido thinks. I
dialog: think we are happy with Donatella.
dialog: Donatella's better, isn't she?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: DANTE
dialog: (delighted, jumps up)
dialog: Great. Anyway, fantastic day, but we
dialog: have to go home. We have a very, very
dialog: busy day tomorrow. Thank you very much
dialog: everybody. Thank you. Okay, well
dialog: done.
dialog: The screening room empties, a lot of mutual
dialog: congratulations on good work, especially to Lilli, and
text: a hug or a handshake from almost everybody for Luisa.
text: Lilli kisses her, leaves. Just the two of them now,
text: husband and wife, several rows apart in the empty

text: Guido sits in an audience of raucous men who have
text: filled all the seats around him. They start to whistle

scene_heading: GUIDO OUT IN SPACE
dialog: WITH NO DIRECTION,
text: GUIDO AT A LOSS FOR WHAT TO SAY,
text: GUIDO WITH NO INTERVENING ACTORS,
text: GUIDO AT THE MERCY OF DETRACTORS,
text: GUIDO HERE, WITH NO ONE ELSE BUT...
scene_heading: NOTHING HOLDS TOGETHER
text: NOTHING MAKES A BIT OF SENSE NOW
text: IMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP OR UNDERSTAND
text: HOW CAN I GO ON TO WATCH THE WHOLE OF
speaker_heading: MY EXISTENCE
text: END UP BEING NOTHING THAT I PLANNED
dialog: HAVE I LOST MYSELF AND ALL I WISHED

scene_heading: GUIDO, FOR GODSAKE,
dialog: WHO IS THIS GUIDO?
text: GUIDO HERE, WITH NO ONE ELSE BUT
dialog: GUIDO...
text: Guido collapses to his knees.
speaker_heading: GUIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: (honest)
dialog: I destroyed everything, Mamma...
text: Suddenly, his mother appears.
speaker_heading: GUIDO (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I destroyed everything, I just...
dialog: you make one wrong turn and then
dialog: because of that, after it all the
dialog: turns are wrong. And you are so far
dialog: from where you wanted to be...and
dialog: you're lost and then you're lost.
dialog: p. 87
speaker_heading: MAMMA
dialog: No one can help you find your way.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: It's up to you, Guido. Up to you.
dialog: Nobody else.
text: In Guido's face, a soulful recognition that what she's
dialog: said is true.
scene_heading: INT. CINECITTA, STAGE 5 - DAY
text: A HUGE CRASH...
text: ...A large piece of Guido's set comes crashing down.
text: Dante and Guido walk through the empty soundstage,
text: leaving behind the set which is being dismantled by a
text: group of construction workers.
speaker_heading: GUIDO (O.S.)
dialog: Old friends, I have to come clean with
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY
text: REALITY. Guido faces his production team. This is
dialog: hard for him.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: There is no movie. I can't pretend
dialog: anymore. We have to stop.
dialog: (nothing more to say)
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: There is silence in the room.
scene_heading: EXT. CINECITTA, STAGE 5 - DAY
text: The metal soundstage door opens as Guido and Dante walk
text: through and into the sunlight. Guido is defeated. He
text: stops at his car and turns to Dante. Guido gets in his
text: car. Guido drives away. Dante watches him go.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON
text: A cold wind blows. A lonely figure (GUIDO) walks along
text: a deserted beach.
scene_heading: SUPERTITLE: Anguillara, Italy, 2 years later
dialog: p. 88
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH CAFE, ANGUILLARA - AFTERNOON
text: It's the end of the season. Only a few customers left
text: in the cafe, as the waiters close up for the day,
text: pulling down umbrellas, stacking tables.
text: Guido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt.
text: Haggard. He looks out to sea, alone, as the waves
text: crash to and fro. A newspaper sits open in front of
text: him. Scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a
text: theater production in Rome. Guido gets up at this
text: moment, starts to leave, hesitates, takes the paper,
text: folds it under his arm, and exits the restaurant.
text: He heads up the steps towards the promenade and we
text: catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes -
scene_heading: EXT. ROME, THEATER - NIGHT
text: Guido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street
text: from a theatre that's presenting the Pirandello play,
text: DIANA E LA TUDA, starring LUISA ACARI.
text: Luisa exits the theatre with the company of actors, all
text: of them plaited together in post-performance bonhomie.
text: Guido watches from a distance.
text: Luisa takes the arm of a handsome male, as they cross
text: and head down the street.
scene_heading: EXT. ANGUILLARA STREETS - DAY
text: Guido and Lilli walk along the waterfront. People pass
dialog: by occasionally. They talk -
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: I'm glad she's acting again. I made
dialog: her costumes for the play. She's
dialog: funny.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: She seemed so happy. I didn't want to
dialog: interfere... Is she with anybody?
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: Guido, she's my friend. I'm not her
dialog: mother. I don't know. I expect so.
dialog: Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me
dialog: you're going to let me cut your hair
dialog: and get rid of that awful beard.
dialog: p. 89
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I like to get about without everybody
text: pointing at me.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: And where are you getting about?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be
dialog: able to walk.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: Are you seeing anybody?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: No, no. Nobody.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Well, it sounds exciting. Walking
text: around and not seeing anyone, growing
dialog: a beard. I might come up here and
dialog: join you.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Don't tease me, Lilli. My heart is -
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: - I know.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I just miss her. I should have IDIOT
text: tattooed on my forehead.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: Luisa certainly thinks so.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (grasping at this)
dialog: Does she? Did she really say that?
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: Stop! I'm not going to act as a
dialog: postman between you both. Come back
dialog: to Rome. Make a movie. Go to work.
text: He sits. Lilli joins him.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: No. Never. I've spent this time
dialog: trying to learn something, Lilli, to
dialog: not be the person who forgets about
dialog: everybody else, the person who never
dialog: grew up.
dialog: p. 90
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: You're such a dope, aren't you?
dialog: Making movies wasn't your problem. You
dialog: were your problem. Don't stop being
dialog: a child. You'll never make another
dialog: movie! Nobody wants that...
dialog: especially Luisa.
text: She indicates the people who pass.
speaker_heading: LILLI (CONT'D)
dialog: Guido - there probably isn't a single
dialog: person passing by who hasn't been
dialog: touched in some way by one of your
dialog: movies. That's your gift. That's what
dialog: you've been given. Use it. Just use it
dialog: with some grace. For Chrissake.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (doubtful)
dialog: The only movie I could make now would
dialog: be... I don't know... would be about a
text: man trying to win back his wife.
speaker_heading: LILLI
dialog: Sounds perfect.
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: The costumes might not be so bad too.
text: FLASH: Lights from a makeup mirror. A glimpse of a
text: female eye applying false eyelashes.
text: FLASH: A man of the collar applies pancake makeup,
text: while a cigarette dangles from his lips.
text: Young Guido, 9, appears and whispers into Guido's ear.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GUIDO
dialog: We're ready to begin!
scene_heading: INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS
text: A surreal backstage, the cast of Guido's life, whores,
text: models, schoolboys, priests, etc. A show about to
dialog: begin.
text: The music of "Be Italian/Folies Bergere" plays and
text: builds throughout.
text: People run past with props, lights, etc. Showgirls are
text: hurrying. A beautiful confusion.
dialog: p. 91
scene_heading: EXT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY
text: Guido pulls up in his car outside the soundstage. He
text: stops the engine, and sits for a moment in silence.
text: Summoning his courage, he gets out of the car. He is
text: greeted by Pierpaolo. He seems to need and acknowledge
text: his support. Pierpaolo is tender.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I can't remember how you do this.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: You'll remember.
scene_heading: INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS
text: The camera moves through the backstage mayhem.
text: Mamma is in her dressing room preparing. Saraghina is
text: sharing a dressing room with a Priest. He is helping
text: with her corset. Carla and Luigi. Carla fixes her
text: husband's hair. Claudia and Stephanie smoke and talk.
text: Lilli adjusts her own, and other men's wardrobe.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY
text: Guido is in his element again, locked in passionate
text: discussion with an ACTOR and an ACTRESS. In his hand,
text: an actual script. The set surrounding them is modest;
text: a tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets.
text: The vast film Italia has clearly given way to something
text: smaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and a
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: I don't want to say too much. The
dialog: first way that we kill our film is by
dialog: talking about it. But this scene is
dialog: about reconciliation. And within the
dialog: scene I would like you to try and find
dialog: your way to begin that journey back
text: towards each other.
scene_heading: INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS
text: Young Guido rushes by the dressing rooms.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GUIDO
dialog: Presto! Presto! Take your places!
dialog: Andiamo! Andiamo!
text: The dressing rooms begin to empty.
dialog: p. 92
scene_heading: INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY
text: From high above on the soundstage catwalk, Young Guido
text: watches Older Guido at work.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: (Continuing to speak to
dialog: his actors)
dialog: Maybe it's the most important building
dialog: block that we have to begin again...
dialog: We start from the beginning each time
dialog: and I feel today as if I'm starting
dialog: from the beginning. We'll just keep
dialog: asking each other questions, and don't
dialog: look to me for the answers, okay?
text: On cue, Young Guido opens the door behind him and
text: ushers in THE CAST OF GUIDO'S LIFE. They enter with a
text: sense of anticipation and excitement and arrange
text: themselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom
text: behind Guido. They are all dressed in angelic white.
text: But Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task
text: that lies ahead. He talks to his cameraman. Puts down
text: his script. He takes off his jacket and hangs his
text: glasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set
text: in front of him.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: Maestro, should I call final checks?
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO
dialog: Makeup, please! Final checks!
text: A LONG WIDE PAN reveals a tableau vivant looming behind
text: Guido like a glorious choir, his every muse, his every
text: inspiration. They watch him as he begins to work. A
text: part of him now and forever.
text: Guido sits on the crane.
text: The soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure
text: slip quietly onto the set. Tentatively, she steps
text: through the shadows. It's Luisa. From a discreet
text: distance, she watches her husband return to his gift.
text: Pierpaolo calls for silence.
speaker_heading: PIERPAOLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Alora. Silencio per favore. Silence
dialog: please.
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: Gyriamo. E alora motore!
dialog: p. 93
scene_heading: CLOSE UP ON THE CLAPBOARD. WORKING TITLE: NINE. DIR:
scene_heading: G. CONTINI.
text: As the clapboard strikes.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER LOADER
dialog: Slate.
text: At the last moment, Young Guido runs fast, down the
text: maze of steps, across the soundstage and jumps onto the
text: crane with Guido as it begins to rise. Luisa watches.
text: As the last note plays, the crane soars higher,
text: carrying Guido up and up.
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: ACTION.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
