speaker_heading: UPRANGE

text: in the punishing desert heat.
text: While nibbling on a SNICKERS candy bar, Thompson glances over
text: his shoulder noting potential threats: a WOMAN in a VEIL and
text: then TWO MALES in a window - all of whom are watching him

speaker_heading: SANBORN

speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: You'll never get it in if you do

text: quite capable of showing surprising backbone.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Give me a second.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: No. Time is up. My dick.
text: They change places. Thompson now on the controls. They can

speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: See that?
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Nice one-five-five.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: Yeah. That’s going to do some

speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: (calling over his
dialog: shoulder)
dialog: Hey Eldridge, we’re going to need a
dialog: charge.
text: Eldridge is already on it, approaching with the four blocks
text: of C4 plastic explosive. He’s done this enough to know what
dialog: they need.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: Got it. Figured four blocks, gives
dialog: you about twenty pounds of bang
dialog: total. Are we going to be far
dialog: enough away?
text: Thompson takes stock of the situation. We see the IED in the
text: distance -- far, far away.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
text: The blast is going to roll out
dialog: there (pointing) the shell will
dialog: probably kick out there (pointing),
text: and most of the shrapnel is going

text: Sanborn kneels down and guides Thompson’s feet into the

text: to secure the armor, like a squire working on a knight.
text: Thompson twists to get his chest protector on. Eyes tight,

speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: Okay. I’m going to make my

speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Go!

speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: No, they changed the name about a

speaker_heading: JAMES

speaker_heading: SANBORN

scene_heading: EXT HUMVEE MOMENTS LATER
text: Sanborn and Eldridge kneel before James, buckling on the

speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: You know you don’t have to go down

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It will be alright.
text: Sanborn puts the helmet on.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: First day, I was thinking you might
dialog: want to take it easy.
text: Now enclosed in the suit, James is ready to go.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Let’s rock ‘n roll.
text: James heads downrange, a jaunty bounce to his step.
text: In stark contrast to Thompson’s cautious, lumbering gait, he
text: seems eager, almost happy, to approach the bomb.
text: The guys watch him go.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: He’s a rowdy boy.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: He’s reckless.
scene_heading: EXT BAGHDAD STREET

speaker_heading: EXT HUMVEE

speaker_heading: JAMES O.S.

speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: (walkie)
dialog: From what? Is there a threat?
dialog: (to Eldridge)
dialog: Get up on that wall. Tell me what

text: Eldridge leaps onto a nearby narrow stone wall, feet

dialog: 24
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
text: I got him. He’s walking downrange.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: (walkie)
dialog: James, the smoke is killing my

scene_heading: EXT BAGHDAD STREET/INTERSECTION
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (headset)
dialog: Hell, I don’t know. I’1l let you
dialog: know when I’m standing over it.
text: We see the world from James’ point of view: the city takes on
text: an intense, dreamy hue as if somehow we're in some sort of
dialog: fugue state.
text: James walks on and the world returns to normal as he nears an
text: intersection guarded on either side by a HUMVEE and several
dialog: SOLDIERS, when...
text: Suddenly a red-and-white TAXI swerves past the SOLDIERS on
text: the left side of the intersection.
text: The soldiers take cover and shout contradictory commands -
dialog: “Stop the car” “Get Down Don’t Move! Back up! Out of the
dialog: vehicle!”
text: The TAXI BRAKES in front of James.
speaker_heading: EXT HUMVEE
text: Sanborn and Eldridge can hear the shouting but the lingering

speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: (shouting to Sanborn)
text: Car! Car! A car stopped in front of

scene_heading: EXT BAGHDAD STREET/INTERSECTION

scene_heading: EXT BAGHDAD STREET/INTERSECTION
text: James aims at the windshield. The driver is impassive.

dialog: tire.
text: The Driver remains still. Staring back.
text: James gestures with the pistol.
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It’s that way...Back.
dialog: James FIRES --

speaker_heading: JAMES
text: The driver slowly shifts into reverse and eases the taxi back

scene_heading: EXT BAGHDAD STREET/RUBBLE PILE IED
text: One of a million in this city. James draws near. Two wires
text: protrude from the mess.
dialog: Moment of decision.
text: Moving quickly, James removes rubble and trash to expose the
text: wires and the artillery shells.
dialog: 27
text: He kneels down into the rubble pile. Touches the bomb.
text: Then with great care, he removes the blasting cap from the
text: bomb, making sure that it doesn’t make contact with the metal
text: edges of the artillery shell.
text: He cuts one wire leading to the blasting cap.
text: Then he flips the artillery round over and cuts the other

speaker_heading: DOWNRANGE
text: James stands and uses his big boot to clear more rubble,
text: revealing: Another wire snaking out of the ground.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (headset)
dialog: Got a wire. Hang on..
text: James traces this wire, pulling it out of the ground, inch by
text: inch, like extracting a buried root.
text: The more he pulls, the more wire gets revealed.
text: It doesn’t seem to end.
speaker_heading: BALCONY
text: Overhead, a YOUNG FACTORY WORKER on a high balcony studies
text: James as he unearths the wire.
dialog: 28
scene_heading: EXT BAGHDAD STREET/RUBBLE PILE IED
text: James, still pulling the wire, comes to a length that ends in
text: a bundle of wires that spider out in several different
dialog: directions.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (headset)
dialog: Secondary!
text: He pulls on this bundle and unearths a second IED.
text: Then he finds a third IED.
text: Then a fourth bomb.
text: Then realizes he’s surrounded by a ring of IEDs.
dialog: 
text: This is the daisy-chain. One of the deadlier forms of IEDs.

speaker_heading: EXT STREET
text: The worker reaches the bottom of the stairs, opens the

text: He looks at James.
text: James shows him the last blasting cap, indicating that the

text: The worker reveals nothing.
text: He turns and steps down an alley. As he goes he drops a 9-

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That wasn’t too bad, for our first

speaker_heading: SANBORN

text: Eldridge frantically searches a few nearby backpacks.
speaker_heading: RIDGE
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I need that ammo man!
speaker_heading: RAVINE
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: I'm looking. Where is it?
speaker_heading: JAMES O.S.
dialog: Check the dead guy.
text: Eldridge flips over the body of the slain contractor. His
text: chest is pulped.
text: Nestled in the gore are several .50 magazines. Eldridge grabs
text: them with shaky hands and passes them up to James.
speaker_heading: RIDGE
text: James passes the ammo to Sanborn. He slams it into the
dialog: receiver.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Same target.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Got it.
text: Sanborn pulls the trigger. Click.
text: ECU: Hand cycling the weapon. Finger pulling trigger. Bolt
text: catching, jammed.
dialog: 66
speaker_heading: SANBORN
text: It’s jammed. The blood is making it
dialog: jam.
text: Sanborn removes the clip and hands it back to James who hands
text: it back down to Eldridge in the ravine, instructing him:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Eldridge, you got to clean the
text: blood off the bullets. The blood is
dialog: making it jam.
text: Eldridge takes the magazine and rubs the top bullet to no
text: good effect, for the dust on his hands sticks to the blood
text: and the blood sticks to the bullet.
text: He rubs harder, only making it dirtier.
text: James peers down and realizes that Eldridge is lost.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Spit and rub, man. Spit on them.
text: Eldridge tries to spit on the bullets.
text: His mouth is too dry to produce salvia.
text: He tries again. Nothing.
text: James sees his escalating despair and slides down the ridge,
text: coming next to Eldridge.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Use your camel (referring to the
dialog: Camelback water canteen).
text: James squeezes the nipple of Eldridge’s Camel and directs the
text: water to drip on the bullets. It sort of works.
text: Sitting side by side now, they rub away the grime and polish
text: the bullets to a bright shine.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You're doing good, man. You’re
dialog: okay. I’m going to keep you safe.
text: James takes the clean bullets and climbs back to the ridge,
dialog: telling Eldridge:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Scan your sectors.
dialog: 67
speaker_heading: RIDGE
text: Sanborn loads the clean bullets and fires.
speaker_heading: SCOPE POV
text: One figure on the roof is hit. The other man crawls back and
text: out of sight.
speaker_heading: RIDGE
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Nice. You got him. Second one is
text: out of range.
speaker_heading: SCOPE POV
text: Scanning... Another FIGURE, lying on the desert floor.
speaker_heading: RIDGE
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: Twenty meters to the right of the
dialog: building. You got a target.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: I got him.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Fire when ready.
speaker_heading: SCOPE POV
text: Sanborn’s bullet strikes the ground a dozen feet in front of
text: the man, kicking up a harmless puff of dust.
text: The man gets up and runs towards the building while firing
text: his AK-47 back at Sanborn and James. His carbine’s muzzle
text: flash, ineffective at this great range, sparkles in the
text: bright day.
speaker_heading: RIDGE
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: He’s moving to the building. Follow
dialog: him. You got him?
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Got him.
text: Sanborn pulls the trigger.
speaker_heading: SCOPE POV
dialog: 68
text: Sanborn’s bullet strikes the fleeing man in the upper chest,
text: blood spurting as the large round throws him dead to the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: RIDGE
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You got him. He’s down. Good night.
dialog: Thanks for playing.
speaker_heading: SCOPE POV
text: The sniper in the building appears in the window.
speaker_heading: BUILDING
text: The insurgent sniper team leans out the window and fires
dialog: James and Sanborn.
speaker_heading: RIDGE
text: The bullet snaps near James and Sanborn.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Window! Window!
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Got it.
text: Sanborn fires.
speaker_heading: SCOPE POV
dialog: at
text: Miss! Sanborn’s bullet strikes the building just below the
text: window and the insurgent team withdraws inside.
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: He’s still there.
dialog: 69
text: The insurgent, having run to the other side of the building,
text: now appears in the other window, the left window. James sees
dialog: his barrel.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Left window! Left window! Got him?
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Got him.
text: Sanborn turns his head away from the gun and makes an audible
dialog: exhale to release tension: the sniper breath control
text: technique. Then he fires a hit; the insurgent slumps in the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: He’s down.
speaker_heading: SCOPE POV
text: The roof of the tall building in the distance bobs in and out
text: of view; the scope dances at this range.
text: James scans the area. Silence.
speaker_heading: DESERT WIDE
text: We mark the passage of time with dust devils spinning across
text: a horizon of lengthening shadows.
scene_heading: EXT/INT DEEP RAVINE HOURS LATER
text: The sun lower in the sky. Around the pit, the fallen TEAM
text: LEADER has been pushed to one side, and the living are
text: hanging on to their sanity.
text: Eldridge and the remaining contractors have exhausted their
dialog: water supply.
text: Eldridge is in a sentry position facing east, in the
text: direction of the railroad tracks. The other two contractors
text: are in sentry positions facing south and north.
dialog: Sanborn and James are in EXACTLY the same position as when we
text: left them, exposed to the elements. Desert heat and sand have
dialog: taken their toll on Sanborn especially.

speaker_heading: EXT SANBORN POV
text: The scope BLURS as Sanborn’s vision fails for a moment.
speaker_heading: RIDGE
text: James notices Sanborn’s fatigue.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Eldridge, grab me the juice out of
text: an MRE.
text: Eldridge digs around the dead TEAM LEADER'S backpack and
text: retrieves a packet of juice, which he passes to James.
text: James inserts the straw into the juice pack.
text: He hesitates, not sure if Sanborn will accept the gesture
dialog: after all the hostility that’s passed between them...
text: James brings the straw to Sanborn’s lips.
text: At first, Sanborn keeps his attention on the rifle scope.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Drink.
text: with some discomfort, Sanborn opens his sun-scorched lips and
dialog: sips.
speaker_heading: RAVINE
text: Eldridge scans the horizon--
text: --a small HERD of GOATS amble along the railroad tracks.
text: He rubs his eyes, looks again--
text: --Somewhere within the herd a flutter of fabric--
text: Eldridge stiffens.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: At your six o'clock. Movement on

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Deal with it.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: Uh, okay.
text: Eldridge looks down his scope, unsure. James keeps his focus
text: forward on the building.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: Should I fire?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Your call.
text: Eldridge shifts his weight onto his rifle.
text: Another flutter of movement at the edge of the tracks.
text: Eldridge pulls the trigger. Then he pulls it again. And
text: again, emptying his magazine at the distant target.
text: The goats scatter, revealing a lifeless BODY draped across
dialog: the tracks.
text: Eldridge slumps, let’s go of his rifle.
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:

text: Dusk. Shadows fall over James and Sanborn, both of whom
text: remain lying in the exact same sniping position, although now
text: they are covered head to toe in sand.
text: There’s no movement in the house. No movement on the far

scene_heading: INT CAMP VICTORY JAMES’ TRAILER NIGHT
text: Play time: James and Sanborn square off, drunk, swaying, red-
text: faced, fists clenched. When Sanborn nods, James punches him
text: in the stomach.
text: James smiles; he looks good. The unleashed aggression is like
text: a vitamin to him.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That’s what you get for hitting
dialog: your team-leader, motherfucker.
text: With difficulty, Sanborn straightens up and stumbles out of
dialog: the trailer.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Be right back. I gotta piss.
text: James lurches towards Eldridge.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Owen, another round. That’s an
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: (imitating a young
dialog: recruit)
dialog: Yes, Sir, Sergeant James Sir.
dialog: You're not very good with people
dialog: are you -- but you’re a natural
dialog: warrior.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You acquitted yourself well on the
dialog: field of battle today, Specialist.
text: They clink cups. Eldridge gulps his whiskey.
text: James collapses in his chair.
text: Eldridge sits down carefully.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: I was scared.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Everyone is a coward about
dialog: something.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You did good.
dialog: 73
text: As Sanborn loudly stumbles back into the room, he notices by
text: the door something a little odd under James’ bed: a box. It’s
text: odd because there is nothing else in the barren room besides
text: Army-issue furniture, lights, and the whiskey they’ve been
dialog: drinking.
text: Curious, Sanborn retrieves the box out and sets it ona
text: makeshift coffee table to get a better look.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Just what do we have here? Will has
dialog: possessions! I didn’t know you
dialog: owned anything, Will.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: Let’s see what you got.
text: Sanborn pulls out a weathered snapshot of a baby boy.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That’s my son. He’s a real tough
dialog: little bastard. Nothing like me.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: You’re married?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Well, I had a girlfriend. She got
dialog: pregnant and we got married and
dialog: then we divorced. Or, I thought we
text: divorced. She’s still in the house
dialog: and she says we're still together.
dialog: So I don’t know. What does that
dialog: make her?
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Dumb - for still being with your
dialog: ass.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (hotly)
dialog: She ain’t dumb. She’s just loyal,
dialog: that’s all. (beat) What about you
dialog: guys - what have you got?
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: My problem is the girl I like I
dialog: can’t stop from talking about
dialog: babies.
dialog: 74
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Give her your sperm, stud. Make
dialog: babies!
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Nah.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Go on, you chickenshit. Do it!
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: No, I know when I’m ready and I’m
dialog: not ready for that yet.
dialog: (looking around the box,
dialog: finds a circuit board)
dialog: And what do we have here?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (embarrassed)
text: Components. Bomb parts. Signatures.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: I see that. But what are they doing
dialog: under your bed?
text: James pulls out a circuit and gazes reverently at the
dialog: mechanical design.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: This one is from the UN building,
text: flaming car. Dead man switch -
dialog: boom! This guy was good. I like
dialog: him. This one was from our first
dialog: call together. This box is full of
dialog: stuff that almost killed me.
text: Eldridge rummages through the box and finds a gold ring
text: hanging from a cheap chain.
text: He dangles the ring in front of James.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: What’s this one from, Will?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That’s my wedding ring. Like I
dialog: said, stuff that almost killed me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I think it’s interesting to hold
dialog: something in your hands that could
dialog: have killed any one of us.
dialog: 75
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: (looking at the circuit
dialog: board)
dialog: It’s a piece of junk from Radio
dialog: Shack.
text: Eldridge, ever unsure, allies with James.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: It’s interesting.
speaker_heading: JAMES SANBORN
dialog: I agree. I think it’s I think that punch was harder
dialog: interesting, too. than I hit you. Therefore, I
dialog: owe you a punch. So get up
dialog: motherfucker.
text: James leaps up, pleased to end the conversation.
text: Sanborn follows, clapping his hands -- cruising for a
text: bruising.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: Hold on, we need some rules. No
text: face shots.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: There’s gonna be a face shot.
text: Eldridge picks up a magic marker and tells James to take off
text: his shirt.
text: Then he draws a bulls-eye on James’ bared stomach.
text: And as he does, he notices knotty scar tissue.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: My mother dropped me at birth.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE SANBORN
dialog: Looks like frag scars. Let it go, Eldridge.
text: James smiles, raises his arms, exposing his midsection to
dialog: Sanborn.
text: Sanborn winds up for a powerful blow. He leans back, then
text: launches a gut punch that knocks James to the floor.
text: James lies there in a heap, laughing.
dialog: 76
text: When he gets up, he’s laughing so hard that gleeful tears run
text: down his face.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: You like that?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That all you got?
text: Now Sanborn raises his arms, bracing for the blow.
text: James feints a right cross, fakes a jab, then grabs Sanborn
text: by the neck and unleashes a brutal uppercut to the solar
text: plexus. Sanborn collapses, moaning in pain.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: That’s got to hurt.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Get up, bitch.
text: James extends his hand to help Sanborn off the floor.
text: But when Sanborn reaches for help, James rushes him wildly,
text: like a football tackle, knocking him back to the floor, and,
text: in a sudden fit of aggression, he then jumps on Sanborn’s
text: chest, pins his arms with his knees and clasps his throat.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What have you got now?
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Get off me!
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Come on, what have you got.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Get off of me you freak!!
text: Sanborn tries to buck James off but he can’t dislodge the
dialog: former Ranger.
text: Sanborn redoubles his efforts, throwing his weight this way
text: and that. Still, James remains on top -- his face twisted
text: with a macho snarl.
dialog: 77
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We got a wild one here!!
text: Sanborn bucks harder. But instead of knocking James loose,
text: his kicking and struggling to get free spurs James to even
text: deeper levels of male weirdness. And as Sanborn kicks and
text: bucks underneath him, James pumps his hand like a cowboy at a
text: rodeo, crying out:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I'm riding him! That's right!! He's
dialog: a wild one and I’m riding him!!
dialog: COME ON BITCH!!!
text: Now Sanborn reaches for his boot knife.
text: ECU: knife blade snapping open
text: Sanborn jams the blade against James’ throat and their eyes
dialog: lock.
text: James smiles like a child. He pats Sanborn’s head and laughs.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I’m just kidding motherfucker!!
dialog: Shit!!!
text: At last, Sanborn is released. James pats him on the chest.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You're alright, Sanborn.
dialog: (to Eldridge)
dialog: Owen, get this guy another drink.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT CAMP VICTORY HOURS LATER
text: Sanborn, too drunk to stand, is being guided across the
text: barracks square by Eldridge and James. When they come to
text: Eldridge’s trailer, James shoulders Sanborn by himself and
text: Eldridge goes inside.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: Later.
dialog: It’s not easy for James to carry Sanborn alone and Sanborn
text: nearly slips to the ground.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You need to go on a diet.
dialog: 78
text: They walk a little farther to Sanborn’s trailer, passing a
text: SOLDIER who looks at them curiously. Drinking is not allowed
text: on US bases in Iraq. James brushes aside the officious look,
text: saying “he hurt his knee” and guides Sanborn up a set of
text: stairs into Sanborn’s trailer.
scene_heading: INT. SANBORN’S TRAILER
text: James eases Sanborn onto a cot and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Get some rest.

dialog: it takes to put on the suit?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hell no.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Good night, boy.
scene_heading: INT JAMES’ TRAILER LATER THAT NIGHT
text: James stumbles inside, flops on the bed, and takes another
text: swig of whiskey.
text: He lies there and stares at his bomb helmet, which is sitting
text: on a desk adjacent to his cot.
text: He looks at the helmet... and reaches for it.
text: Then he brings the helmet over his head and adjusts the
text: straps and unlocks the glass protective masks, so that it
text: snaps down over his face and his entire head is sheathed in
dialog: the protective metal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A man encased in his armor.
text: He leans back in the bed and we HEAR the rasp of James
text: BREATHING. ..daydreaming...as he re-experiences the feeling of

speaker_heading: CAMBRIDGE
dialog: Stay safe.
text: INT BOMBED OUT BUILDING
text: James, Sanborn and Eldridge enter a landing. The floor is
text: very wet. They cross it, and come to a room that has been
text: severely damaged by a bomb, with rubble everywhere and
text: exposed electrical wires dangling from the ceiling, and
text: busted pipes gushing water. A tea pot sits on a STOVE,
text: steaming hot, and a plate on the table has bread on it.
scene_heading: WATER LOGGED ROOM
text: They gingerly investigate a large cavernous room with leaky
text: pipes dripping water onto an oil-slicked floor. We HEAR their
text: breathing, the water DROPLETS falling. Moving tactically,
text: covering all sides of their approach, they press deeper into
dialog: the building down
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: A dark corridor which the insurgents have strewn with glass
text: as an early-warning system. Advancing slowly, glass CRUNCHING
text: underfoot, they pass through this corridor into
dialog: 81
speaker_heading: CLASSROOM
text: A classroom lined with student’s desks and chairs, beyond
text: which lies another room. James and Sanborn spin quietly into
text: this room, rifles raised, while Eldridge hangs back to cover
dialog: the corridor.
scene_heading: INSURGENT LIVING SPACE
text: They find themselves in a recently used living area. A teapot
text: cooking on a bunsen burner hisses steam. Mattresses and
text: bedding line the walls of the room. The walls are decorated
text: with Jihadist slogans, and a video camera for making
text: recruiting videos has pride of place on a tripod in the
text: center of the room.
text: Sanborn checks under the mattresses for hidden explosives,
text: finds none, and exchanges a worried look with James.
text: Moving as one unit they spin into the next room.
speaker_heading: EMPTY ROOM
text: It’s empty, another forboding large space strewn with rubble
text: and garbage. They pass through this area and push open a door
dialog: to --
speaker_heading: BOMB FACTORY
dialog: Santa’s bomb making factory.
text: In contrast to the spare spaces they’ve just passed through,
text: this room is overflowing with the tools of a an insurgency
dialog: that uses bombs as its primary weapon: electronics and
text: explosives of all kinds are everywhere: artillery shells,
text: boxes of batteries, plastic explosives, military manuals,
text: rockets, grenades, stacks of dynamite, tools, magnifying
text: glasses, and soldering guns.
dialog: Though a few of these munitions bear the stamps of foreign
dialog: militaries, most bear insignias in English. It is,
text: ironically, a cache of armaments that formerly belonged to
dialog: the American military.
text: The men weave through the piles of explosives, slowly
text: checking every space where a human could possibly be hiding.
dialog: At last they’re satisfied:
dialog: 82
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Clear!
text: Eldridge draws near to one desk where a cigarette burns in an
dialog: ashtray.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: This cigarette is still smoking!
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: This is all our shit. Motherfucking
dialog: gold mine. Watch out for trips.
speaker_heading: BACK OF ROOM
text: In the back half of the room, a plastic curtain hangs over a
text: work table, forming a make-shift sterile room.
text: Smelling the copper odor of blood and death emanating from
text: behind that curtain, James pushes the plastic to one side.
text: He draws near to a table, where he sees the DEAD BODY of a
text: YOUNG BOY wearing pants but no shirt. Flies buzz over his
text: bloody bare chest.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I got something.
text: Sanborn and Eldridge come beside him, and approach the body
dialog: cautiously.
text: The dead young man’s chest has been cut open. An artillery
text: shell is shoved inside the cavity where the heart used to
text: beat. Wires protrude from the shell.
text: James shakes his head no as Sanborn moves closer to the body
text: and inspects the wiring in the chest.
text: The boy’s FACE, half in shadow, is so disfigured by bruises
dialog: that it’s hard to identify. But it might be someone familiar
dialog: to James.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I know this kid. His name is
text: Beckham. He sells DVDs.
text: Sanborn ignores that and turns to Eldridge.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: You ever see a body bomb before?
dialog: 83
text: Eldridge shakes his head, pulling his neck scarf up over his
dialog: nose.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: This is disgusting, let’s get out
dialog: of here.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Eldridge, grab all the C4 and det
dialog: cord you can get your hands on.
dialog: Let’s get the rest of it out of
dialog: here and just blow it in place.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Roger that.
text: Sanborn and Eldridge leave James alone with the body.
text: He stares at the boy.
text: EXT BOMBED OUT BUILDING
text: Cambridge, with limited Iraqi language skills, is trying to
text: speak to a MAN piling rocks in the back of his donkey cart.
speaker_heading: CAMBRIDGE
dialog: What are you doing? Moving the

text: The Iraqi peasant replies in Arabic, motioning to the rocks
text: and his cart.

dialog: concerns him.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: You alright man?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Yeah, no one in or out.
text: Eldridge nods. Makes a hasty exit.
text: James pulls C4 blocks from his pack and arranges them around
text: the body. He plugs a blasting cap into the C4. In doing so he
text: finds himself drawn to the dead boy’s eyes, which seem
text: somehow to stare directly at him.
text: James tries to keep his feelings in check and his mind on the
text: task by arranging the charges and preparing the detonation.
text: But he can’t. The war has finally reached him.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (into walkie)
dialog: Cancel the det.

speaker_heading: KALIM
dialog: Be careful! The gun can go off.

text: nightmare of tangled limbs and body parts. Then fires, smoke,

text: stretchers, ambulances, police, fire trucks...the ghastly,
text: frantic aftermath of a major detonation.
text: Their combat flashlights send piercing white beams into this
text: grim spectacle, while in the distance a huge fire, a GLOWING
text: RED INFERNO at the end of the block, lights what we now see
text: is a blast radius that extends for a nearly a mile.
text: Moving towards the glowing fire, past ten foot high flames
text: and the remains of houses pulverized to concrete and glass,
text: rubble piles, past screaming women and more bloody wounded
text: being carried away by IRAQI POLICE...
dialog: 95
text: they pause to try and help Iraqi police save a man pinned

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Oil tanker?
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Yup. Pretty long flight.
text: Moving ahead, the men split up, navigating different paths
text: through this hectic apocalypse:
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
text: A Bhurka-clad WOMAN appears out of the distant flames and
text: haze, looking disoriented, in apparent shock. Behind her is a
text: blazing car.
text: On the ground beside the car lies a single black loafer.
text: Eldridge sees the lone shoe and is at a loss to process its
dialog: significance.
text: Another mind-numbing, soul-numbing casualty of war.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
text: At a gigantic rubble pile, Sanborn reaches down to remove
text: chunks of stone covering a BODY.
text: The stone slides away but another falls in its place.
text: Sanborn looks down, sees a second man, or what’s left of a
text: man: head and torso but no legs -- just stumps, twitching.
text: Around him, GRIEVING FAMILIES pick through the dead and dying
text: with IRAQI MEDICS.
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: Drawing near to the inferno, he moves past burning palm trees

text: And comes at last to the burning steel carcase of...
dialog: 96
speaker_heading: OIL TANKER
text: an OIL TANKER.
text: From what's left of the twisted metal sub-frame flames twenty
text: feet high scorch the night, like the maw of hell on earth.
text: James stares, transfixed by the burning...the imprint of some
text: insurgent’s plan.
text: His face hardens now in a way we haven’t seen before, and as

dialog: war of his own.
text: The insurgents are out there somewhere.
dialog: Ahab and the Whale.
scene_heading: SANBORN AND ELDRIDGE

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: This is the edge of the blast

text: Sanborn comes into view. James nods to him, then stares into

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: So where's our trigger man?
speaker_heading: SANBORN
text: Burnt up in the flames. Suicide
dialog: bomber. You'll never find a body.

text: A really good bad guy hides out in

dialog: You want to go out there?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Yes I do.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: I could stand to get in some

text: Sanborn looks at James and looks at the bandage on his head.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: No, man, this is bullshit.
dialog: You got --what?-- three infantry
dialog: platoons here whose job it is to go
dialog: haji hunting. That’s not our job.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You don’t say ‘No’ to me, Sergeant.
dialog: I say ‘No’ to you. You know there
dialog: are guys watching us right now.
dialog: (on the move)
dialog: We're going.
text: James glowers at Sanborn and Eldridge and moves deeper into
text: an unlit field behind the lemon grove.
text: Eldridge shoots Sanborn a sympathetic glance and follows
dialog: James.
text: Sanborn watches them recede into the darkness. Then he runs
dialog: after his team.
speaker_heading: EXT FIELD
text: They move across the dark field, three abreast into the
text: enveloping night.
text: We gradually lose sight of them in BLACKNESS. Seeing nothing,
text: we HEAR, however, their BREATHING, and gravel CRUNCHING
text: underfoot.
dialog: 98
text: After a long moment of no visibility...they’re faintly
text: visible again in dim florescent light and we see:
scene_heading: EXT PARKING LOT
text: A shadowy parking lot filled with marooned cars, beyond which
text: lies a neighborhood of one-story homes and narrow alleys.
text: Amid the cars, the men come across the bullet-shaped hull of
text: an intact oil tanker. They crouch beside it, whispering:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We know where the oil tanker came
dialog: from.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: It’s the same kind.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We're close. These alleys are
dialog: probably set up in a grid. We’re
dialog: going to split up to flush them
text: out. Sanborn take the first alley.
dialog: Eldridge take two. I got three.
dialog: Rally point at your intersection.
dialog: Ready? Move!
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Wait? Rally point? When?
text: But James has already dashed into the third alley.
speaker_heading: ALLEY TWO
text: Eldridge, walking slowly, not sure he likes being alone.
speaker_heading: ALLEY THREE
text: James runs confidently, sees a few kids in a doorway and
text: tells them to scoot.
speaker_heading: ALLEY ONE
text: Sanborn runs to make up for being the last to leave.
dialog: 99
speaker_heading: ALLEY TWO
text: Eldridge peers into an abandoned house. He thinks he hears
dialog: something.
dialog: Spins.
dialog: It’s nothing.
speaker_heading: ALLEY ONE
text: Sanborn slows. Catches his breath when suddenly --
text: --BLAM, BLAM, BLAM - the staccato of GUNFIRE slaps off the
dialog: concrete--
text: Sanborn dashes full speed back to the alley’s opening.
speaker_heading: ALLEY THREE
text: James turns, runs hard back into--
speaker_heading: SANBORN AND JAMES
text: --the first intersection, where he sees Sanborn and shouts
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You got contact?!
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Who is it?! What’s going on?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What have you got?!
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: It's Eldridge!!
speaker_heading: ALLEY TWO
text: They come to Eldridge’s alley where they see that a body lies
text: on the ground. They run to it.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Man down!!
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: Eldridge!!
dialog: 100
text: As they draw close they see not Eldridge but the BODY of an
text: Iraqi insurgent, dead from gunshot wounds.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It’s not him.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: He’s gone?!
text: A moment of decision.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: That way is towards the tanker,
dialog: troops.
text: They run down the alley into a maze of narrow streets and
text: dimly lit corridors.
speaker_heading: NARROW STREET
text: Turning a corner, they catch a fleeting glimpse of Eldridge
text: being dragged away by TWO INSURGENTS.
text: Before they can fire, the men are gone.
speaker_heading: CORNER
text: They run to this corner and prepare to spin around it and
dialog: shoot.
text: James hands Sanborn his flashlight.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Hit ‘em with both lights. One, two,
dialog: three!
speaker_heading: DARK CORNER
text: They spin around the corner and flash light revealing NOTHING
text: but an empty street.
speaker_heading: NEXT ALLEY
text: They sprint to the next block, and again see Eldridge being
dialog: dragged.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: One, two, three.
dialog: 101
text: Again, they aim and spin: Sanborn shines the light - beams
text: Eldridge and the two insurgents -- and James FIRES two short
text: bursts from his M4.
text: The two insurgents collapse.
text: But Eldridge also goes down.
text: Running up, James and Sanborn see the insurgents are
text: motionless, shot clean.
text: One bullet, however, has gone astray into Eldridge’s leg and
text: he’s bleeding profusely.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Eldridge you okay?
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: I’m hit!
dialog: As James and Sanborn apply first aide:
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: You hit him in the leg!
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: (panting)
dialog: Am I dead?
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: No, you're alright.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You're fine.
text: Eldridge looks to Sanborn for confirmation that wound is
dialog: indeed not mortal.
speaker_heading: ELDRIDGE
dialog: Am I dead? Am I dead? Am I dead?
text: As Sanborn and James yank Eldridge off the ground, he screams
dialog: in pain.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT CAMP VICTORY SHOWER STALLS LATER THAT NIGHT
text: James trudges into an empty bathroom and looks at himself in

dialog: 102
text: His shirt is crimson with Eldridge’s blood.
text: He steps inside a shower stall, still dressed in full battle
text: rattle, and turns on the hot faucet.
text: The water streams over him...and he lets go, punching the
text: wall, thrashing his arms, then sinking down sobbing, broken,
text: as his uniform soaks through and the reddish pink water
text: swirls down the drain.
scene_heading: EXT CAMP VICTORY HEAD SHED MORNING
text: Looking fine and wearing a fresh clean uniform, James strides

speaker_heading: BECKHAM
dialog: Hey, what’s up man? Hey Boomala,
dialog: Boomala, wanna buys some DVDs, play
dialog: some soccer!
text: James stops. He stares. What can he say? The boy is fine.
dialog: His jihad was pointless. Insane.
text: Unable to face the kid and unwilling to explain, James turns

dialog: close.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (to translator)
text: Tell him to open his shirt, slowly.
dialog: I need to see what’s inside.
text: The translator SHOUTS in Arabic.
text: The MAN unbuttons his jacket, revealing...
text: Clamped to his chest is a metal cage, locked with padlocks,
text: and loaded with blocks of C4 wrapped in nails.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (to the soldier)
dialog: I'd need a seventy five meter
dialog: perimeter.
dialog: (to translator)
dialog: Tell him to get on his knees and
dialog: touch the sky. Get down!
text: The translator SHOUTS. The man in the BLACK SUIT, gripped
text: with despair, drops to his knees and raises his hands.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Can we just shoot him?
dialog: As James considers that option when --
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: NO. He's not a bad man. He has a
text: family. The bomb was forced on him.
text: He is asking for help. Only help.
dialog: 106
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (to translator)
dialog: I want you to get back. I got it.
text: Sanborn pulls James aside for a private moment and pleads

speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: We've had our differences.
dialog: Eldridge. It happened. That’s
dialog: water under the bridge. But this --
dialog: this is suicide.
dialog: James considers. Sanborn’s right, of course. But he can’t
text: help himself. Like a moth to a flame, this is what he does.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That's why it’s called a suicide
dialog: bomb, right?
text: Sanborn reluctantly seals James in the helmet.
text: They bang fists.
scene_heading: DOWNRANGE NEAR SUICIDE BOMBER
text: James grabs a nearby soldier’s walkie, then starts the walk
text: downrange. Soldiers moving back to their perimeter...
text: PEDESTRIANS gathering for a look. Soldiers scattering them

text: Black Suit smiles thinly as James nears. James nods at him.
text: The man nods, frightened.
speaker_heading: BLACK SUIT
dialog: Inshalla. Inshalla.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Put your hands up!
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: He says he has a family,
text: James kneels down to get a closer look at the bomb strapped
text: to the man’s belly. He takes out his 9mm and puts it on the
text: guy's forehead. Cocks the trigger.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Look, it would be a lot easier for
dialog: me to disarm this if I just shoot
dialog: you. Do you understand?

text: BLACK SUIT replies in Arabic.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (into walkie)
dialog: What is he saying?
scene_heading: UPRANGE FROM SUICIDE BOMBER
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (headset)
dialog: Tell him to put his hands behind

text: Translator conveys this to BLACK SUIT in Arabic. BLACK SUIT

speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: (over walkie)
dialog: He says, please hurry he has a
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (to translator)
dialog: Look, it’s not what I said. Tell
text: him to put his hands behind his
dialog: head or I will shoot him.
text: James holds the walkie up to the man’s ear, “listen,” “do you
dialog: understand?”
text: Now James sinks to his knees and examines the bomb, all the
text: while keeping his pistol on the man’s head. There is a
text: FOREST OF WIRES. He pushes them aside, revealing a cheap
text: Casio digital WATCH, which is counting down from five
dialog: minutes.

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (headset)
dialog: Sanborn, we got a timer. We got a

speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: (over headset)
dialog: Roger that, what do you need?
text: James feels around the bomb. It’s strapped to the BLACK SUIT

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (headset)
dialog: Bolt cutters. But you got two

speaker_heading: SANBORN

speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: You weren't kidding.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Nope.
text: James works the cutter blade.
text: ECU: Bolt Cutter. It SCRAPES futilely against the metal.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: What is this made out of?
speaker_heading: SANBORN
text: Case hardened steel.
text: James doubles his effort.
text: ECU: Bolt Cutter. The blade bites the steel, but it doesn’t
text: give. James squeezes with all his might.
speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: What’s our time?
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: Two minutes.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We'd need torch to get this off.
speaker_heading: SANBORN

text: ECU: Casio Watch 1:46.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Hold on let me think. We got this.
dialog: I can handle it. I’m going to look
text: at the back.
text: Sanborn nods. His hand is starting to shake.
text: James goes behind the man, and rips open the back of his
text: shirt, revealing the back of the bomb.
text: Here too it is a welded band, but the metal looks thinner.
text: James works it with the cutter.
text: ECU: Casio Watch 1:30.

text: The soldiers turn and run.
text: James strains to clip the metal bar of the lock, putting all
text: of his weight into the effort. Finally, the blades slices.
text: ECU: broken lock falls to the ground.
text: James sees that he has four more locks more to cut. The time
text: is ticking down to 20 seconds.
text: James brings himself face-to-face with the man he can’t save.

speaker_heading: JAMES

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I’m sorry. You hear me? I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: BLACK SUIT

text: James drops the bolt cutter, kneels down in front of the man,

text: The man understands James’ gesture. He reaches forward,
text: grabbing James’ suit.
speaker_heading: BLACK SUIT
dialog: (in Arabic)
dialog: No! No! Please
text: James brushes his hand away.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I’m sorry.

speaker_heading: SANBORN
dialog: I’m not ready to die, James.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You're not going to die out here,

text: shelves of frozen treats glistening behind reflective glass,
text: in the shiny and perfectly sterile cathedral to consumerism
dialog: otherwise known as a supermarket.
text: James looks different here, awkward, less sure of himself.
text: With his hair grown-in and his dreamy expression, he could be
text: just another suburban softy pushing a shopping cart.
text: He’s home but this is clearly not where he lives.
text: A beautiful young WOMAN approaches him from the other end of
text: the aisle. She too is pushing a shopping cart and in it is a
text: small BOY. She smiles at James and says:
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Honey, will you grab some cereal
dialog: and I'll meet you at the checkout.
text: CONNIE JAMES smiles again and pats her husband on the
text: shoulder. As she walks away, he mumbles:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Where’s the cereal?
text: But she’s already out of ear shot.
speaker_heading: CEREAL AISLE
text: James stares at the rows and rows of cereal boxes, a medley
dialog: of different brands all containing the same sugar and
text: coloring and starch.
text: He looks this way and that.
text: Thrown by the abundant choices after the starkness of
dialog: Baghdad, he can’t decide which brand is his.
text: He reaches for a box, then pulls back, still unsure of
dialog: himself.

text: isn’t sure where to go with this..An odd moment for the wild-
text: man of Baghdad: playing the awkward dad to his adoring child
text: James looks into his son’s unconditionally loving eyes.
text: Something he sees there prompts a confession:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You love playing with that, don’t
dialog: you..? You love all your stuffed
dialog: animals. You love your Mommy, your
dialog: Daddy. You love your pajamas... You
dialog: love everything, don’t you?
text: James playfully spins the mobile. The boy laughs at the
text: whirring color.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: But you know what buddy, as you get
dialog: older some of the things that you
dialog: love might not seem so special
dialog: anymore. You know? Like your Jack-
text: in-the-Box.
text: The boy touches the Jack-in-the-Box, smiling beautifully.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Maybe... you'll realize it’s just a
text: piece of tin and a stuffed animal.
dialog: And the older you get, the fewer
dialog: things you really love.

dialog: By the time you get to be my age,
