text: As presentation credits begin, we hear Johnny Cash's "Home

dialog: under that Robert's, under that Quentin's, then under that

text: FADE UP ON A WALL
text: The camera pans down a weathered wall covered with postcards
dialog: from Miami Beach, Florida, the Copacabana, N.Y.C., "Wish You
dialog: Were Here" from Niagara Falls, rickshaws and babes on beaches,
dialog: etc....
text: The camera comes to rest on an old photograph of a 1930s
text: hotel, the "Mon Signor," in its heyday, with a full staff of
text: 30 people posed on the lawn in front.
text: An old guy with a staccato voice delivers a monologue:
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: There used to be a staff of fifty in
dialog: this place. I'm the only one left
dialog: from those days. It all comes down
text: to one sap: the night-shift bellhop,
dialog: that's me. What the hell is a bellhop?
dialog: You know where the name comes from?
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Of course not... It's so simple it's
dialog: stupid. They ring a bell and you
dialog: hop. You hop to front and center. No
dialog: heroes in this line, kid. Just men
dialog: doing a job. No questions asked,
dialog: none answered. I try to keep it
dialog: simple, kid, not too personal...
text: Another voice of a young man interrupts.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You met any of those old stars?
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: Stars! Are you kidding me? I took
dialog: Rin Tin Tin out for a shit, for
dialog: Christ's sakes. I taught Shirley
dialog: Temple how to roller-skate. I saw
text: Fatty Arbuckle regurgitate three
text: cheese sandwiches right on the spot
dialog: you're sitting, kid. What did you
dialog: say your name was?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ted.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: Ted, right. I remember Marilyn used
dialog: to come down at night and doze off
text: in the kitchen. She liked the sound
text: of the fans out back spinning around.
dialog: Sure, these were stars, kid. Errol
dialog: Flynn used to call me "Alibi." You'll
dialog: pick up a few stories yourself, kid.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don't think so, not like yours.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: What do you think a star does when
dialog: he goes to the bathroom, kid?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Beats me.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
text: He pulls his pants down and takes a
dialog: crap just like you and me. Take my
dialog: word for it.
text: A wisp of smoke passes over a napkin pinned to the wall with
text: a lip print on it signed "Marilyn." The camera pulls back to
text: reveal Ted and the Old Guy sitting on a foldout cot in a
text: small back room of the Hotel Mon Signor. The old man is
text: dressed in a striped T-shirt with a bellhop's cap on. He
text: looks like an old pirate. Next to him on the bed sits Ted, a
text: young guy with a bellhop jacket draped over his knees. The
text: old bellhop takes a long drag off a big cigar.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: Camacho!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: The cigar. Cuban. A good cigar,
dialog: wrapped in Miami. I get a box of
dialog: them every Christmas from the chairman
dialog: of the board. I think he sends them
dialog: to me to keep my mouth shut. It's
dialog: tough not to get a little personal
dialog: in this business.
text: The old bellhop takes a hit off his cigar and stares down at
text: his cap, lost in thought.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What do you mean?
text: The old guy passes the cap over to Ted.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: Put it on.
text: Ted puts the cap on.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: Frankly, you look stupid... like the
dialog: Philip Morris guy. I can't believe I
dialog: wore that thing for fifty years. You
dialog: keep it.
text: The Old Guy gets up from the bed and throws a jacket on.
text: Pulls a few postcards off the wall, throws them in an old
text: straw suitcase, and slams the lid down. He heads for the
text: door. Ted follows.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: Stay away from night clerks, kids,
dialog: hookers, and marital disputes.
text: The Old Guy pauses for a second and looks Ted dead in the
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: Never have sex with the clientele.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No way, not me. You got any other
dialog: advice.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: Always get a tip.
text: The door slams shut on the back room.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY--TWILIGHT
text: The big empty lobby of the Mon Signor. You can tell that at
dialog: one point this used to be a swank place. It still is, kinda.
text: It's also kinda decrepit. The concierge -- a snappy, fast-
text: talking, red-haired young woman in a blue blazer named Betty --
text: stands behind the reception desk. The old man, suitcase in
text: hand, makes a beeline through the lobby, heading toward the
text: front door. Betty sees him.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sam! Hey, Sam, wait a minute!
text: The Old Guy stops in his tracks and turns around.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: What?
text: Betty comes from behind the desk.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I just want to say good-bye.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Uhhh, Betty. The concierge. Your
dialog: boss.
text: The Old Guy squints his eyes at the young gal.
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: Oh yeah. Gotta light, sister? Goddam
text: cigar went out.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yeah, sure.
text: She speaks to the Old Guy as she lights his cigar and he
text: puffs away.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I just want you to know, from the
dialog: owner and all the staff, your fifty
dialog: years of service have been an
dialog: inspiration to us all. You're a legend
dialog: in your own time, and the Mon Signor
dialog: will never be the --
speaker_heading: THE OLD GUY
dialog: Just forward my cigars, Red.
text: (He turns around the
text: walks out, saying
text: over his shoulder)
dialog: Aufwiedersehen!
text: Betty is left standing in the lobby. Ted appears behind her
text: in his bellbody uniform, sans cap.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sam the bellboy. Now there was a
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yeah. Oh, hi, Teddy. Ready to start
dialog: the night shift?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, let me buy you a drink.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You wanna buy me a drink? I'm starting
dialog: my shift.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You're not an alcoholic, are you;
dialog: one drink won't kill you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah, sure.

scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM--NIGHT
text: Betty and Ted sit in the back room, both with drinks in their
text: hand. This dialogue is to be delivered rapid fire, Howard
dialog: Hawks style.
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: After fifty years, Sam retires, and
dialog: you're taking over the night shift.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You're filling some mighty big shoes.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, I know.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sam was a legend in the hotel
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, I know...
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: A bellhop's bellhop.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: An inspiration to us all.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: He ran the night desk for fifty years,
dialog: all by himself.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: An amazing man.
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: No desk clerk. No night man. No help.
dialog: Just fuckin' Sam, and his wits.
speaker_heading: TED
text: A man alone.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: And you're gonna do the same.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Tonight.
text: Ted spews his drink.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Tonight!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes, tonight.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes, you can.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No, I can't. I never worked the night
dialog: shift before.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh night shift -- smight shift.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We were supposed to work it together.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I know, but I can't.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Since when?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Actually, I'm not having it. My
dialog: roommate is. And there's this guy.
dialog: German guy. He's gonna be there. And
dialog: so am I.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I can't run this place by myself.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, sure ya can.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No, I can't.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sam ran this place by himself for
dialog: fifty years.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah, and he had fifty years of
dialog: fuckin' practice, too. I haven't had
dialog: a day.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Look, Teddy, calm down --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: -- Don't call me Teddy.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ted, the night's cake. It's easy.
dialog: The day's when it's busy. During the
dialog: night there's nothing to do.
speaker_heading: TED
text: It's New Year's Eve.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Which'll make it less busy than
dialog: normal. Ever worked on Christmas?
dialog: Unless you sell turkeys, business is
dialog: dead. You just got butterflies, that's
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What I have ain't butterflies. I
dialog: can't handle this hotel all by myself.
text: Betty slows the scene down.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Okay, let's calm down a minute. Slow
dialog: it down, cool it off. Let's just
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You can say any goddamn thing you
dialog: want --
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: -- Ted? I thought we were calming
dialog: down? I thought we were cooling off?
dialog: No hostility. Say good-bye to
dialog: hostility. We're just talking.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay... okay... okay... I'm calm,
dialog: I'm cool, let's talk.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ted, in a nutshell, all you have to
dialog: do is hold the fort. It's New Year's
text: Eve. Most of the guests are going
dialog: out. You'll just be giving them a
text: little nod as they come staggering
dialog: in at three... four... five... in
dialog: the morning. Nobody's having any
text: parties, a few get-togethers, but no
dialog: parties. You got about three people
dialog: checking in tonight, that's it. The
dialog: only variable is Chester Rush in the
dialog: penthouse.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Chester Rush? The guy from The Wacky
dialog: Detective?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yeah, him and his entourage checked
dialog: in last night. They're in the
dialog: penthouse. The only reason I refer
dialog: to it as a variable is that he's a
dialog: movie star. Ya never know about movie
dialog: stars. I'm tellin' ya, Ted, it's
dialog: cake.
text: Betty takes a piece of paper and writes her number down.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And look, if you have any problems,
dialog: call me at the party.
text: Ted thinks about it for a moment.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Great --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: -- For fifty bucks.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Fifty bucks!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You're shirking your duties for this
dialog: Nazi. For that you pay a price, and
dialog: the price is fifty bucks.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: One, Horst is not a Nazi. Two, that's
dialog: not a fair price. You're taking
dialog: advantage of the situation. Twenty
dialog: bucks. Now, twenty bucks is a fair
dialog: price.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah, but what you're doin' to me
dialog: ain't fair. And, you are completely
dialog: and totally taking advantage of me
dialog: and your position. So fifty bucks is
dialog: the perfect price.
text: Betty begrudgingly digs in her purse.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Okay, but don't be a pussy. You don't
dialog: bother me unless it's an emergency.
dialog: In fact, for fifty bucks, you better
dialog: not call me unless the fuckin'
text: building's burning down.
text: She gives him the money.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Get ready to take the desk.
text: Betty leaves.
text: Ted sits in the chair, takes another drink, and prepares
dialog: himself for the night.

scene_heading: EXT. THE MON SIGNOR HOTEL--DUSK
text: Ted, the bellboy, meets his first guest of the evening, as a
text: taxi unloads her luggage. To his warm surprise, the guest is
dialog: a Beautiful Mediterranean Goddess (actually, we will come to
text: see she is not technically a goddess, but a High Priestess).
text: She is about 25 years old, speaks with an Italian accent and
text: is dressed in Gypsy garb. She is Athena.
text: Ted takes Athena's luggage onto his cart. But one item in a
text: woven Moroccan bag proves to be unbearably heavy. Athena is
text: concerned as he attempts to lift it.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Pleeze be careful -- my God. You
dialog: have no idea...
text: Ted strains as he uses all his cojones to lift the insanely
text: heavy bag onto the cart. Athena tips the cab driver, stingily.
text: The driver winces and gets in the cab. Ted has now managed
text: with grunts and groans and strained blood vessels to put
text: this thing on the cart. The cab skids away. Athena looks at
text: Ted, who is out of breath.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I'm usually a good tipper, but this
dialog: one -- this cab driver -- he had
dialog: green all around him. I don't like
dialog: that in a man.
text: Ted wheezes and pounds on his chest.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Green? Is that bad? Like you read
dialog: auras or something like that?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah, well what color are you seein'
dialog: around me... how's the tip lookin?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I see purple... in your face, and...
text: As if she can't help herself, Athena's eyes are strangely
text: drawn to his crotch.
text: She frowns, confused by this impulse. Ted appears to be
text: charmingly oblivious.
text: Athena looks back into his face.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: ...you're okay.
text: Ted touches his face -- as if searching for the "purple" in
text: it -- and moves the cart inside, discreetly checking out his
text: crotch and giving her a confused side glance.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT DESK--DUSK
text: Ted shifts hats to check the girl in. He checks her
dialog: reservation.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Athena Z.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (scratching his head --
dialog: weird name, okay)
dialog: You're booked in the Honeymoon Suite --
dialog: just one night? With all this luggage?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I will only need to stay till sunrise.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay... and how will you be paying?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: With gold.
text: He looks at this wacky Gypsy chick numbly -- she pulls out
text: her Gold Card and smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEVATOR--DUSK
text: The doors open and Ted and Athena emerge upon the third floor.
text: Ted follows Athena with the cart down the hallway to her
dialog: room.
scene_heading: AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR
text: Ted opens the door, then lifts the easiest bags first. In
text: the center of the room is a Jacuzzi with hokey plastic cupids
text: poised with urns on each side. A dormant fireplace looms
text: beyond the still hot tub.
text: Ted stares at the heavy bag with anxiety -- then looks in
text: front of him to Athena as she rubs the round plastic head of
text: a little Cupid and mumbles, "Perfect."
text: Then, arms open wide, chin lifted to heaven, eyes closed,
text: she mumbles a faint incantation. Then she does a belly-dance
text: wiggle and turns to Ted, who is truly perplexed.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Well -- the other bag -- I need it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Right.
text: He starts to lift it, again straining and turning purple. He
text: laughs sickly.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What the hell you got in here, lady?
dialog: Nuclear weapons?
text: She relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: The White Cliffs of Dover.
text: Ted is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and
text: pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage. She hands it
text: to him. Ted is grateful and disoriented.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: The others will be coming soon. Send
text: them, pleeze.
text: Ted nods, confused by "the others," and walks off with the
text: cart. Then he turns from outside the doorway.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh -- I forgot to show you how to
text: turn on the Jacuzzi.
text: But Athena is ahead of him -- she flips a switch and water
text: begins to flow from the baby cupids' urns into the hot tub.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I been in dis' place many New Year's.
dialog: So... you send the others to me,
dialog: huh. Go now.
text: As she says this, the door closes with a strange force,
text: shutting Ted out. Athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the
dialog: suite.
scene_heading: IN THE SUITE BEDROOM
text: A round bed with pink tuck'n'roll headboard. It's impossible
dialog: to imagine having an orgasm in this room -- unless it were
text: achieved by laughing.
text: Athena carefully removes a large, beautiful white slab of
text: stone from her tapestry bag. She caresses it and carries it
text: like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center, the
text: head of the rock resting on dusty heart-shaped pillows.
text: Then she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching
text: high-heeled slippers.
text: And these she places with reverence on the bed.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: On this night, oh great goddess Diana,
dialog: we restore your virgin flesh and
dialog: bring you back to real life.
text: CLOSE ON the rock slab. We hold the artifact.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Soon -- I take you to the pond for a
dialog: cleansing. Well, it's a swimming
dialog: pool, but it will be under the setting
dialog: sun, okay?
scene_heading: INT. FRONT DESK--DUSK FALLS
text: Just as Ted is recovering from the mystery of this first
text: guest, Elspeth arrives.
text: She has skin like marble, the body of Venus, piercing blue
text: eyes, blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing, like
text: Honey West in a rubber dress. She carries several bags, and
text: a silver sword on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: May I help you?
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: I... we... have a reservation.
text: Then she snaps, irritated, behind her.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Kiva!
text: ANGLE ON a young punk rocker chick with long orange hair, a
text: long leather coat, wearing a tight T-shirt with studs spelling
text: "PUSSY" across her breasts. This is Kiva.
text: Kiva is kicking the tar and nicotine outta the cigarette
text: machine. Just as Ted's eyes grow wide with anxiety, several
text: packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquent's hands.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: Wait up, gawd! I had to get supplies
dialog: for this boring ass night.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: We have a reservation in the Honeymoon
dialog: Suite.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh yeah... you must be one of "the
dialog: others." And what're you carrying --
dialog: the Rock of Gibraltar?
text: She stares at him without humor. He fumbles for the key. He
text: walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile
text: luggage. Jars clang inside. He is ready to go, but Elspeth
text: turns to lecture Kiva on the hazards of smoking, as Kiva
text: lights up.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: What'd I tell you about smoking?
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: You smoke.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: That's right -- I smoke, and I'm
dialog: addicted to it, and I don't want the
dialog: same thing to happen to you.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: (in game-show host
dialog: voice)
dialog: "Hello -- welcome to this week's
dialog: edition of the Hypocrite of the Year
dialog: Award --"
text: As Kiva goes off on her impression of a game-show host,
text: Elspeth is growing increasingly rageful, like a mother with
text: an unruly child. Ted waits, luggage in hand.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Kiva! That's enough --
text: She cuts Kiva's ramble off. Kiva blows smoke defiantly.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: You're not my mother!
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Yes I am.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: Then why're we sleeping together?
text: Ted looks on uneasily at the relationship that is beginning
dialog: to unfold here.
text: Elspeth checks his reaction and becomes self-conscious at
dialog: his scrutiny.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Well... I didn't mean it... literally.
dialog: I... I happen to be the only one
dialog: who... cares about you --
text: But her wild child looks off, bored. Elspeth turns to Ted,
text: flustered.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Please -- take us to our room!
text: Ted smiles uneasily and reaches to relieve her of her sword,
text: but Elspeth quickly slams her palm on the sword and shoots
text: him a piercing glare. He jumps back with a light nervous
text: laugh. He leads the way to the elevator.
scene_heading: AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR
text: The couch has been set out here in the hall, as well as coffee
text: tables, lamps, and the TV. Elspeth and Kiva enter the room.
text: Athena is gone. As Ted stumbles around the furniture in the
text: hall, he peers in the room and see a transformation. With
text: most of the furniture removed, candles and incense and flowers
text: are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace.
text: But oddest of all is the pink-tinged water swirling in the
text: Jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns. A sprinkle of white
text: powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub. Elspeth hands
text: him a tip as he gawks at the circle.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
text: Flea powder. One of the others is
text: bringing her cat.
text: Ted starts away again, perplexed. He turns for one last look
text: to see Elspeth kneeling before Kiva, who sprawls on the floor.
text: He shakes his head and leaves.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: You're gonna have to wait in the
dialog: other room.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Because I said so.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: I'll watch TV.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: You can't watch TV because the noise
dialog: will interfere with our ritual.
text: Kiva looks around the room and spies the TV in the hallway.
text: She turns to Elspeth with sarcastic concession.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: Okay... Mommy.
text: Elspeth bristles as the brat saunters off to the bedroom.
text: Elspeth enters the sacred circle, stands before the altar,
text: whips out her sword, and makes a ceremonial gesture pointing
text: the sword upward, perfectly centered between her breasts.
text: Kiva, behind Elspeth's back, exits from the bedroom doorway
text: into the hall and comes back in, lugging the TV into the
dialog: honeymoon bedroom.
text: Elspeth kneels before the altar. Athena enters the room with
text: the "cleansed" artifact and lays the slab in the center of
text: the altar upon the heart-shaped pillows as Elspeth lays her
text: sword next to the rock. The women look upon the union with
dialog: tender affection.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Soon -- our goddess will come. I
dialog: will go get her negligee.
text: Athena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she shrieks!
text: Loud TV suddenly blasts from the bedroom and Kiva the brat
text: is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes. Athena takes
text: the negligee off the irrepressible youth.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: What are you doing! Have you no
dialog: respect -- who -- who is dis girl?
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Kiva. My friend. Kiva, turn off the
dialog: TV! I can't leave her at home --
dialog: she's on probation and I gotta keep
text: an eye on her.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Well, Elspeth, your friend cannot
dialog: stay here during the ritual. She may
dialog: be one of your kind, but she is not
dialog: one of us.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: She stays!! Or I go -- along with my
dialog: offering!
text: The women have a stare-down. Then Athena calls out --
speaker_heading: ATHENA
text: TURN OF THE FUCKING TV, MAN!
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: (in a seductive pout)
dialog: Make me...
text: Elspeth becomes anxious with jealousy. Athena is exasperated
text: as she firmly demands from Elspeth --
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Let's not forget -- I am the High
dialog: Fucking Priestess. Deal with dis
dialog: girl!
text: Elspeth defers to Athena with remembered reverence and
text: respect. She bows apologetic and scurries to the bedroom.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (eyes lifted to heaven,
dialog: wearily)
dialog: Tell me -- did we have these problems
dialog: in Salem? I don't think so...
scene_heading: IN THE BEDROOM
text: Elspeth swallows her rage and approaches the brat with a
text: soft touch.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Kiva... you know what I love about
dialog: you?
text: Kiva smirks... yeah, she knows.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Your sweet side.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: And what do I get if I'm sweet?
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: You get whatever you want. And you
dialog: know what else I love about you?
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: (seduced now)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Your nose.
text: And saying this, she kisses Kiva's nose and leaves the room.
text: Kiva is quieted now. As Elspeth closes the bedroom door, she
dialog: has the last word.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: And I saw you checking her out.
text: Kiva slinks back on the bed, put in her place -- for now.
scene_heading: IN THE HALLWAY/EXT. ELEVATOR--DUSK
text: The doors open and Ted pushes a cart of expensive designer
text: luggage -- and lots of it -- behind yet another Gorgeous
text: Gal. This one is Jezebel, a Southern beauty, fawning over
text: her cat, as she carries nothing else, and proceeds down the
text: hall like a Southern princess.
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: (talking to her cat
dialog: in baby talk)
dialog: Oh you little stinker... oh you sweet
dialog: little muffin. Yes... Mama loves the
dialog: baby.
speaker_heading: AT THE DOOR
text: Jezebel bursts in, chattering.
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: Well, this is just darlin'! Just
dialog: darlin' Hi-dee, girls...
text: Ted carries all her bags inside awkwardly. Again, the place
text: has become all the more transformed with wild canopies of
text: exotic cloths and fixings. Elspeth and Athena are hard at
text: work on a strange nature sculpture as Jezebel enters. She
text: stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot tub,
text: which now has dark blue water swirling inside. She presents
text: her cat -- upward toward heaven -- frees the cat, bares her
text: breasts and sucks in the vibes: "Ahhhh."
text: Ted settles the bags down, hoping for a peek at her charms,
text: but her back is to him. The kitty rubs on her leg. She picks
text: it up and presses it against her bare breasts, petting it
text: sweetly. She winks and hands him a tip.
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: Toodle-loo.
text: And saying this, she shoos him away. Through the glass doors
text: to the bedroom, she sees Kiva sprawled on the bed, writing
dialog: on herself.
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: Well -- I see Elspeth has herself a
dialog: new lil' fool -- what the hell is
dialog: she doin' here on our night of annual
dialog: ritual?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: I have sanctioned her presence, as
dialog: long as she behaves. Come on -- there
dialog: is more work to be done to welcome
dialog: our great Diana.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: I WANT ROOM SERVICE!!
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Why do I always attract girls who
dialog: are looking for a babysitter?
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: Well now, honey, maybe Juvenile Hall
dialog: ain't the best place to find serious
dialog: relationship material.
text: Elspeth seethes at her. Jezebel acts blithely innocent.
text: IN THE HALLWAY
text: Ted is walking from the room with the cart. His face is etched
text: in a mask of perpetual frown as he looks at the tip in his
dialog: hand -- at least these lunachicks tip well.
text: Waking him out of his deep mood is Raven. Another female
text: intoxication, she wears a short skirt, all done up in Native
dialog: American, Southwestern themes. No shoes.
text: But she carries a small, old handmade broom. She moves down
text: the hall, blissed-out. Ted makes eye contact, despite himself.
speaker_heading: RAVEN
dialog: I'm looking for the room for making
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You might be referring to the
dialog: Honeymoon Suite. Straight thata way...
dialog: you can't miss it -- see all that
dialog: furniture in the hallway --
speaker_heading: RAVEN
dialog: Oh I know the way. I just wanted you
dialog: to know that I knew where I was going
dialog: and that you needn't bother yourself
dialog: with me. The others are here -- great!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: Oh yeah -- it's so great -- it's
dialog: fantastic.
speaker_heading: RAVEN
dialog: (in deep empathy)
dialog: Ohhh... I know it all seems very
dialog: strange but you're coping with us
dialog: much better than the bellboys of
dialog: past New Year's.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Past New Year's?
speaker_heading: RAVEN
dialog: Oh yes -- we've been coming here
dialog: every New Year... for a long time.
dialog: Thanks for your patience.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh hey -- no problem -- wreck the
dialog: place. Bring in cats. Ruin the carpet
dialog: with flea powder, pour paint in the
dialog: Jacuzzi. Throw the furniture out
dialog: the... where're your bags?
speaker_heading: RAVEN
dialog: I travel very light.
text: Ted looks down at the broom at her side, her bare feets, her
text: thick dark hair. It keeps getting weirder. She wanders off.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT DESK--NIGHT
text: The last of the lovely girls arrives. She is different from
text: the others. She looks like a farm girl, very Earth Mother,
text: with a tablecloth halter top and skirt, sandals, and a simple
text: scarf over her long dark curls. She carries two bags by
text: herself and holds a small black pot under her arm. She is
dialog: Eva.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (already weary of
dialog: these girls)
dialog: Yeah, yeah, Honeymoon Suite.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Oh... yes... I'm late.
text: She lowers her eyes, worried.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: All right -- lemme give ya a hand.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Oh... no, that's all right. I can
dialog: carry them by myself.
text: She is so sweet and sincere that he feels like a heel to
text: have been irritated with her. He picks up her bags.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm a man doin' a job -- no hero.
text: Eva smiles, beautifully.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Well gosh -- thank you!
scene_heading: IN THE ELEVATOR
text: Ted holds Eva's hippy sacks as she holds her black pot. There
text: is a shy quiet tension here.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Tell me, how long have the others
dialog: been here?
speaker_heading: TED
text: About an hour.
text: Eva's heart sinks. They arrive at the door. He carries her
dialog: bags in.
speaker_heading: IN THE SUITE
text: The room is entirely transformed into a beautiful glowing
text: palace with an elaborate altar, both earthly and the other-
text: earthly. The other four girls are arranging the altar as Eva
text: enters.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: You are very late, Eva.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I'm sorry, Athena. I was attending a
dialog: birth and the placenta was late in
dialog: coming.
text: Ted is slightly queasy. She hands him a tip and smiles, then
dialog: takes it back.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Oh, wait, lemme give you a little
dialog: more than that...
text: Ted's no fool, he waits while Eva looks through her change
dialog: purse.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Which birth is more important to
dialog: you, that of a mortal or that of a
dialog: goddess?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: All life is precious... but I do
dialog: apologize for being late, Elspeth.
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
text: Back home, they jist yank on the
text: umbilical cord, do a Karate chop on
dialog: the mama's belly, and them things
dialog: come right out.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: They do that here, too, Jezebel, in
dialog: the hospitals, but it causes
dialog: hemorrhages. I fed the mother a bowl
dialog: of comfrey tea and it brought the
text: afterbirth down perfectly. The couple
dialog: are going to use it for fertilizer
dialog: to plant a lovely tree for their
dialog: baby.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: Oh wow -- if they were really back-
dialog: to-nature, they'd eat it, like other
dialog: mammals do.
text: CLOSE ON Ted's face as he gets thoroughly grossed out.
speaker_heading: RAVEN
dialog: In some Native American cultures,
text: they dry the umbilical cord, grind
dialog: it to a fine powder, and put it in a
text: leather pouch that the baby wears to
dialog: ward off evil. But burying the
dialog: placenta is also a very sound
dialog: ecological practice -- 'cause of the
dialog: oxygen it carries.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (cheerfully to the
dialog: others)
dialog: Yes -- because you see when the
text: placenta detaches from the uterine
dialog: wall...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (wincing in disgust)
dialog: Uh, thank you, ladies -- I'll be
dialog: going now. If you need anything --
text: Eva places a nice tip in his palm.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Wait. We do need a few things.
text: Ted sighs as Eva enters the circle with her black pot. She
text: kneels softly, holds her hands in piety before the altar,
text: and softly incants as she offers her pot and places it on
text: the altar. The stone and sword and flowers now rest here on
text: pillows covered in chiffon scarves. The negligee hangs from
text: the mantel, the slippers underneath as if expecting someone
text: to materialize into the garments.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: We need fresh rosemary from the
dialog: kitchen. Mostly what we need is from
dialog: the kitchen. Hey, are you listening?
text: Ted is watching Eva, enchanted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah, yeah, rosemary.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: And a little bit of sea salt or Kosher
dialog: salt if you don't got no sea salt. A
dialog: bottle of spring water -- Italian
dialog: please, not French shit.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: And some french fries!
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Kiva, shut up.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (irritated)
text: And some ginger, two of the eyes of
text: a trout fish, and a piece of raw
dialog: meat, liver if you have it.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: (whining)
dialog: I want fries -- you dumb jerks with
dialog: your stupid fucking ritual!
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Shut up, you little shit.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Don't talk to her that way!
text: Ted has scribbled down the items as she speaks. He looks at
text: this list and these girls and shudders as he walks away. He
text: turns, points at Eva.
text: Ted smiles at this angel of a girl. She smiles back. But, as
text: she looks him in the eyes, he feels a strange buzzing
text: connection happening. He holds his head, almost swooning
text: with dizziness. Athena smirks.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Get to work, man.
text: Ted comes out of his daze, looks at the list again and huffs
text: off. After he goes, the girls begin to bring forth their
text: most treasured offerings in ornate ancient bottles, vases or
text: vials.
text: Jezebel folds her arms and clears her throat in the direction
text: of Kiva, sitting idly on the edge of the blue water Jacuzzi,
text: with her feet dipping irreverently in the water.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Kiva...
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: You have to go in the next room now.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: Oh, wow, like I'm bummed out that I
dialog: can't watch.
dialog: (whining at Elspeth)
dialog: I'm bored!
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: UP!
text: She climbs up the stairs, trying to pull the brat to her
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: Don't put me in there by myself.
dialog: I'll miss you way too much.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Kiva, don't do this to me.
text: Kiva sees a bit of weakening here; she takes her feet out of
text: the Jacuzzi. She begins to speak softly.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: Please... if you just lemme... I'll
dialog: play dress-up with you, the way you
dialog: like it... you know what I mean...
dialog: remember...?
text: Elspeth begins to weaken. But continues to pull the brat up.
text: Kiva pours on softer seduction.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: We can pretend and I'll do it
dialog: exactly... the way you want it...
text: with the egg whites and the kilt.
text: Elspeth is now fully seduced. Kiva takes Elspeth's hand and
text: presses it lightly on her face.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: You mean... like last week?
text: Kiva nods. Elspeth is enthralled, but from a disgusted "ick"
text: sound from Jezebel, Elspeth realizes she's revealing this
text: side of her life -- in front of her coven. She nervously
text: looks around and see all the coven looking at her: a disgusted
text: Jezebel, an understanding Raven, a preoccupied Eva and an
text: impatient and stern Athena.
text: Elspeth comes to her senses, straightens her posture.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: We'll talk about this later, Kiva.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: No!
text: She turns on Elspeth and bites her hand. Elspeth pulls her
text: arm away and grabs Kiva by the hair.
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: Aw, really now -- child abuse?
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: You stay outta this!
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I demand this stop now, Elspeth!
text: Elspeth lets go of Kiva's hair. Kiva jerks away from her.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: I'm running away from you!
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Fine. Go ahead. And I'll call your
dialog: parole officer and she'll find you
dialog: and send you back to Eastlake!
text: Kiva stomps off into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Now that the fucking melodrama is
dialog: over, can we start the goddamn ritual --
dialog: pleeze?
text: Elspeth enters the powered circle. Each girl takes off her
text: shoes. They anoint themselves with oils.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: We are communing here on New Year's
dialog: Eve to bring to life the great goddess
text: Diana, who was turned to stone in
dialog: this very room forty years ago today.
text: The girls moan in sleepy, eerie agreement as they begin to
text: sway within the circle.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Diana, great beautiful one, we make
dialog: these offerings to you, that we may
dialog: undo the wicked spell which deprived
dialog: you of the seed of your lover, your
dialog: virginal blood, of your very life.
dialog: We now form the symbolic rock with
dialog: our bodies.
text: And saying this, the girls all form a "rock" with their bodies
text: gracefully draped one upon the other. Music begins, and slowly
text: they start to unfold from the rock.
text: The girls each find their place in a semicircle around the
text: Jacuzzi. Some bare their breasts, other strip off a layer of
text: clothes. They anoint their arms with water from the Jacuzzi.
text: They begin a lovely dance, snaking their way around the
text: semicircle. The first one to go from one end to the other is
text: Athena. She then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself
text: between the altar and the Jacuzzi. She steps forth with a
text: bottle to the altar and pours it into the Jacuzzi.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: On this night, in this hour, we Call
dialog: upon the Ancient Power O Goddess
dialog: bride, I offer thee Milk from a
dialog: mother's sweet titty!
text: Each of the girls moans eerily. Athena places the bottle on
text: the altar and bows away. She joins the circle as Elspeth now
text: steps forward with her offering in a vial.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: To reverse the evil which has been
dialog: done I make this offering to the
dialog: Divine One A whore not, an innocent
dialog: was, For whom I seized a virgin's
dialog: blood.
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: Goddess of Light, Goddess of Lust,
dialog: To undo this awful spell is a real
dialog: must. To bring you life and get you
dialog: high I offer the sweat of five men's
dialog: thighs.
text: The girls moan loudly as they sway. Jezebel places her
text: offering in the hot tub and bows out, returning to the circle.
text: Now Raven comes forth with a small leather canteen. She
text: unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor.
speaker_heading: RAVEN
dialog: Diana, oh great one, we live without
dialog: sun Until this wicked curse is undone.
dialog: In hope that you live, and to us
dialog: appear, I have collected a year's
text: worth of tears.
text: She pours liquid into the mix, as the witches moan. Now it's
text: Eva's turn. Eva continues to sway, not moving forth to the
text: altar. The girls keep their eyes closed as they sway, waiting
text: for Eva's offering. Athena finally gives her a push and she
dialog: goes.
text: Eva kneels before the altar. She produces a silver bottle
text: with a chain on its cap and neck. She timidly begins to
dialog: incant.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Great Goddess Diana, fail you I will,
dialog: I was to bring fresh sperm from my
dialog: Bill. I had him erect, and his semen
dialog: would follow But alas I was hot, so
dialog: hot that I swallowed.
text: The moans turn to wails as the girls GASP and SHRIEK! Athena
text: opens her eyes, wildly.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: You stupid little witch! You swallowed
dialog: the sperm! Aye-yi--yi!
text: Elspeth opens her eyes and folds her arms, smirking bitterly.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: It just shows what an amazing lack
dialog: of control you have over yourself,
dialog: Eva!
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: Honey, why didn't you just use your
dialog: hands? Didn't your mama teach you
dialog: not to put them things in your mouth?
speaker_heading: RAVEN
dialog: I understand though...
text: Eva bursts into tears. Athena is firm.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: There is no time to cry over swallowed
dialog: sperms. You're gonna have to get
dialog: some, baby. You have one hour to
dialog: prove what kind of witch you really
dialog: are.
text: Just then: a knock at the door.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: What do you want?!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ted... the bellboy.
text: Athena smiles and turns to Eva.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Mr. Bellboy, come right in!
text: Ted opens the door. His eyes bulge out as he looks upon the
text: fleshly feast. He steps back. They giggle seductively, all
text: except Eva, who sniffles, red-eyed.
text: Amazingly, Ted's attention is captivated by Eva's sorrow,
text: not by the naked charms of the other witches. She shyly covers
text: her breasts. Sensitive to her shame and sorrow, he looks
text: away and steps from the door to fetch the room-service cart.
text: Athena directs the others to put on their shirts. Ted wheels
text: in the cart.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Here's the things you asked for. Oh,
dialog: and uhh, sorry, but I'm not gonna
dialog: pick the eyes outta this dead fish.
text: He points to the trout. Elspeth picks it up, flings the eyes
text: into the Jacuzzi, and tosses the trout out of the window.
text: She smirks at him comtemptuously.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (handing Ted 50 bucks)
dialog: Okay, mister, here's your fifty-dollar
dialog: tip, only, you have to do one more
dialog: thing... make our little Eva smile.
dialog: Can you? We'll leave you alone.
dialog: (to Eva, firmly)
dialog: And don't use your mouth!
text: The girls step out. Athena turns to Eva and points to her
text: watch, then holds up one finger. Eva looks up, worried. The
text: door closes on her and Ted. She looks at Ted and sighs. He
text: covers her with a shawl.
text: IN THE HALLWAY
text: The other witches listen at the door.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: If she doesn't get his goop in ten
dialog: minutes, I'm going to take him myself.
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: Ha! That'll be a first for you.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Oh shit -- Kiva!
text: She runs back in for her bratty girlfriend, who is already
text: sneaking out the bedroom door.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: And just where do you think you're
dialog: going?
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: Well, gawd -- I need a candy bar or
dialog: something -- you haven't fed me all
dialog: day. I'm getting all shaky. My blood
dialog: sugar's really low.
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: Elspeth -- honestly now -- some
dialog: babysitter you're turnin' out ta be!
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Enough, girls. I will collect fresh
dialog: earth. Jezebel, I want you to gather
dialog: damp moss. Raven, you bring me a
text: birch branch.
dialog: Elspeth, you go feed your terrible girlfriend. We meet back
dialog: here in one hour and let's all have faith that Eva can get
dialog: this guy off.
text: The witches disperse.
scene_heading: INT. HONEYMOON SUITE--NIGHT
text: Eva sits among pillows before the altar as Ted stands in
text: front of her. Ted is trying his best to make poor Eva smile.
text: But no matter what his antics, she looks off sadly.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Help me out, lady. I gotta earn this
dialog: fifty bucks!
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Oh look, they don't care if I smile
dialog: or not! All they want is...
text: Ted waits; she sighs and rest her chin in her hand.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: You won't understand, believe me.
text: She begins to cry tearfully again.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Try me. I've been around, y'know.
text: He postures proudly, all puffed out. Eva looks at him
text: helplessly. And he paternally encourages her to explain.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Well... okay. The five of us --
text: Elspeth, Jezebel, Athena, Raven and
dialog: me -- are a coven.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ha, like a coven of witches?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Oh.
text: He looks around the room: QUICK CUTS of candles, iconography,
text: jars of lurid substances, unknown body parts of animals woven
dialog: into the nature sculpture... and are those tongues in that
text: can? Ted's getting the creeps, but again puffs himself up.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I knew that!
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (getting calmer)
dialog: And you see, our coven has spent
dialog: forty years trying to perfect a ritual
dialog: to undo a wicked curse put on our
dialog: goddess Diana.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Gee, you don't look a day over twenty!
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Oh... ha ha... I mean the witches
dialog: before us tried and failed. But
dialog: Athena, our High Priestess, discovered
dialog: a great potion to reverse the evil
dialog: spell which turned our beautiful
text: goddess into an old rock.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (looking at the rock)
dialog: Yeah? Is... is that her?
text: Eva nods, looking lovingly at the stone.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: She was a beautiful virgin. An
dialog: entertainer by trade, but a great
dialog: sorceress by design. It was here in
dialog: this very room, on her wedding night,
text: a jealous rival placed the curse on
dialog: Diana.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: She turned to -- that -- here?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Yes... and her young husband turned
dialog: into a pink fish! They found him
text: swimming in the pool in circles.
dialog: While our dear goddess: a stone in
dialog: her honeymoon bed.
text: Ted frowns as he ponders all this. Eva takes a photo from
text: the altar and hands it to Ted.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: This was Diana.
text: CLOSE ON photo: a Blond Bombshell in full-on Betty Page
text: attire, a bare-tittied pinup girl, playfully spanking a girl
text: in bondage with a spiked high heel.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: This girl here? This is the goddess
dialog: Diana?
text: The photograph slowly comes alive. Diana stops spanking the
text: girl and unties her.
text: She pulls the girl (in the black satin mask) up off her lap
text: and makes the girl stand. The women face each other and break
text: into a cheek-to-cheek tango.
text: CLOSE ON Ted as he shakes his head. Are his eyes playing
dialog: tricks on him?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I hate to tell you this, but I kinda
dialog: doubt she was a virgin.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Oh, but she was! She had lovers, but
dialog: she saved that for marriage. Which
dialog: is the example I've tried to follow:
dialog: to do everything but that till I
dialog: marry...
text: She begins to sob again. Ted comforts her.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hey, don't cry... a virgin is a rare
dialog: and beautiful thing. If you say she
dialog: was a virgin, I'll believe it.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Well, it doesn't matter now... and
dialog: she won't be resurrected tonight
dialog: 'cause I failed her. I let my whole
dialog: coven down!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Wait a sec -- that rock was gonna
dialog: turn back into this?
text: He holds up the photo. Eva nods.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Now, that would be something worth
dialog: seeing!
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Only, not now -- we were each supposed
dialog: to bring something -- a life fluid.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (wincing in disgust)
dialog: If this is gonna be like one of those
dialog: afterbirth conversations, I don't
dialog: think I wanna hear this.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Only... I swallowed it...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You swallowed what?
text: Eva looks off. Ted searches his brains, thoroughly sickened
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You mean, you were supposed to
dialog: bring... like... like a guy's... and
dialog: you...?
text: She nods; he winces, queasy. Eva looks at him, helpless.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: And now, you're my last chance!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Yeah, sure.
dialog: (then -- panic)
dialog: Whoa, what? You want my -- for the --
dialog: witchy poo -- ahh no -- no way --
dialog: nope. Besides, it's against hotel
dialog: policy. I was warned: "No sex with
dialog: the clientele"!
text: Eva sobs, pleading. She throws off her shawl, baring her
text: lovely breasts, and reaches her arms around his neck. He
text: keeps backing off. Unbeknownst to him, he is already doing a
text: ritualistic shuffle.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ha, c'mon now, joke's over.
dialog: (seeing this is no
dialog: joke)
dialog: Hey, we're gonna step in the flea
dialog: powder.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: That's not flea powder, that's sacred
text: dust ground from the horns of Albino
dialog: goats.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Right! I knew that!
text: He is backing away, into the circle, as she comes for him,
text: soft and sweet. Her eyes are again putting the magic hex on
text: him, as he tries to resist her gaze.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What's a nice girl like you doing in
dialog: a coven, anyway?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Well, see, what I really want to do
dialog: is be a midwife. I've attended four
dialog: births already! I can prevent vaginal
dialog: tears and everything.
speaker_heading: TED
text: (trying to dodge her
dialog: hexing eyes)
dialog: Well, that's a good thing! A guy
dialog: doesn't like surprises down there.
text: All the while she is stepping toward him into the circle.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I joined the coven to attain greater
dialog: understanding of my feminine power
dialog: so I could become a truly great
dialog: midwife!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (the hex working now)
dialog: Oh, well, I see you've been gaining
dialog: a lot of insight into your... girl
dialog: powers...
text: Eva sweetly takes his hand and places it on her breast.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Do you really think so?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (buckling under the
dialog: temptation)
dialog: Well, yeah, I'd say that seems to be
dialog: the case...
text: (she licks his neck;
text: his eyes roll back
dialog: heavenly)
dialog: Ohhh, God! Betty's gonna kill me!
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Who's Betty -- your girlfriend?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No. My boss.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Oh good!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh no!
text: They fall into a kiss, as she begins to remove his cap. She
text: moves him toward the Jacuzzi, closer and closer.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY--NIGHT
text: Ted pushes his room-service cart. He is flushed. Puffed up.
text: Lights a cigarette, takes a great big, satisfied drag. Eva
text: runs to the door dreamily, her naked body wrapped in her
text: shawl. She passes him a card.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: My phone number in Topanga. Call me?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (cocky)
dialog: Sure, baby. Yeah, I'll give ya a
dialog: call.
text: She smiles and shuts the door. The other witches are arriving
text: with supplies from the garden. Kiva, now having raised her
text: blood sugar, sucks on a lollipop, a sunny girl. She talks to
text: Raven, who carries a birch limb.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: What's that used for?
speaker_heading: RAVEN
text: It's a birch branch, symbolizing
dialog: eternal life. You can also use the
dialog: bark for a tea which assists in astral
dialog: travel.
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: Hey -- I wanna be a witch!
text: The other girls roll their eyes as Elspeth smiles proudly.
text: Ted blows smoke at them and pushes his cart off down the
text: hall. The witches run inside the room.
speaker_heading: IN THE SUITE
text: Eva sits, blissed-out, in the center of the circle, smiles.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I'm a woman now!
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: But where is his "stuff"?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (pointing to the
dialog: Jacuzzi)
dialog: We did it right there, in the big
dialog: cauldron!
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: Ooohhh honey, you're gonna be sore
dialog: tomorra! Didn't your mama teach you
dialog: that water strips a girl's
dialog: lubrication?
speaker_heading: RAVEN
dialog: Sex in water is great in the movies,
dialog: not in real life... but you will
dialog: learn. As we all did.
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: Yeah, when she can't walk...
dialog: (to Elspeth)
dialog: I guess you wouldn't have those kinds
dialog: of problems -- without penetration.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: No. And virtually no cervical cancer,
dialog: either.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Okay, girls, enough Sex Education
dialog: 101, let's get going with our ritual,
dialog: goddammit.
text: Athena regally leads the ritual as they all bare their breasts
text: again. Kiva throws off her shirt to join in. As she does, we
text: see black bondage tape on her nipples. Elspeth darts a quick
text: look at the tape, looks at the other witches -- not sure she
text: likes this -- but she goes with it. The witches sway in a
text: circle, eyes closed, as Eva makes her offering.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Goddess Diana, I offer you The jism
dialog: of one I wooed for you That you may
dialog: live and know such bliss Of getting
dialog: laid by a guy like this.
text: The witches all incant.
text: ALL OF THE WITCHES
dialog: So must it be. Three times three
dialog: times three.
text: They march half-naked as they moan and revel in eerie cries.
text: The Jacuzzi begins to bubble and boil. Their cries heighten;
text: the potion bubbles over.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: HOURS LATER
text: Athena reads from a huge leatherbound book, The Book of
text: Shadows, full of potions and spells. Four discouraged witches
text: pack their bags. The room has been restored to its worldly
text: under-splendor. Kiva uses the remote on the TV... so much
text: for witchcraft. The slab of rock remains a slab.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I don't understand what went wrong.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: I say Eva pulled one over on us.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
text: Honey -- Eva was wearing the face of
dialog: someone just fucked good... and the
dialog: best actress in this world, or any
dialog: other, can't fake a thing like that!
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Exactly -- if she was fucked so good,
dialog: how could she save his come?
speaker_heading: RAVEN
dialog: It could be done...
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Girls, knock it off.
text: (she looks up from
dialog: the book)
dialog: Maybe... maybe it needed to be the
text: sperm of a virgin male.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (dreamily)
dialog: He was no virgin!
text: The witches sadly collect their things. Athena, deep in
text: thought, strokes the slab.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Let's leave her here, with the sword,
dialog: until dawn. I will come back for her
dialog: before checkout time. I just... feel
text: too sad to carry her away before the
text: sun comes up to warm her.
text: They all agree. They pick up their bags and head out.
speaker_heading: JEZEBEL
dialog: (cuddling her cat)
dialog: I can't believe we have to carry our
dialog: own bags out! My mama would have a
dialog: hissy fit!
speaker_heading: KIVA
dialog: (flirtatiously)
dialog: I'll carry your bags.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: You're carrying my bags!
text: They leave the room. Jezebel's cat leaps from her arms as
text: she hoists her luggage. Eva walks out satisfied, thought
text: perhaps a little sore -- "ouch," she says, and smiles. Athena
text: takes one last look at their goddess slab.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Next year, we try again -- with virgin
dialog: sperm.
text: She closes the door on the Honeymoon Suite (till next New
dialog: Year's Eve!).
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: FOUR ROOMS
speaker_heading: FADE UP ON:
scene_heading: INT. MON SIGNOR LOBBY--NIGHT
text: Ted behind the desk, on the phone. We only hear his side.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, Jesus, what did I tell you? Do
dialog: you want milk and cookies, or do you
dialog: not?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I can't turn on an adult station
dialog: without permission from your parents.
dialog: (pause, he checks his

dialog: That's not what the machine tells

dialog: (pause)
dialog: You be good and you'll get milk and

speaker_heading: TED

text: SUPER: 1:00 a.m.
text: The phone rings again.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Room Service.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 404--NIGHT
text: A small party is going on. A long-haired Yuppie Scum type in

speaker_heading: YUPPIE SCUM
dialog: What room am I in?
scene_heading: INT. FRONT DESK--NIGHT
speaker_heading: BACK AND FORTH
speaker_heading: TED

scene_heading: REAL THEODORE
dialog: How should I know? I just got here.
speaker_heading: YUPPIE SCUM
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: You know, don't you have one of those
dialog: light things?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: If you care to go to the door and
dialog: look on the other side, you'll find
dialog: the room number.
speaker_heading: YUPPIE SCUM
dialog: (to Real Theodore)
dialog: Call my assistant and ask her what
dialog: floor we're on.
scene_heading: REAL THEODORE
dialog: Who's your assistant?
speaker_heading: YUPPIE SCUM
dialog: The girl you party with every night.
scene_heading: REAL THEODORE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm here alone, sir.
scene_heading: REAL THEODORE
dialog: It's room 404, I think.
speaker_heading: YUPPIE SCUM
dialog: I could have sworn we were on the
dialog: fifth floor.
scene_heading: REAL THEODORE
dialog: Right. 404.
speaker_heading: YUPPIE SCUM
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Right. 404.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What do you need, sir?
speaker_heading: YUPPIE SCUM
dialog: (to Real Theodore)
dialog: What do we need?
scene_heading: REAL THEODORE
dialog: Ice.
speaker_heading: YUPPIE SCUM
dialog: Ice?
scene_heading: REAL THEODORE
dialog: Ice.
speaker_heading: YUPPIE SCUM
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Ice.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ice.
speaker_heading: YUPPIE SCUM
dialog: Yeah. Ice.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Right, sir. Ice. 404. I'll be with
dialog: you momentarily.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: STORY TITLE CARD:
speaker_heading: ROOM 404
dialog: "THE WRONG MAN"
scene_heading: INT. DARK HALLWAY
text: Ted saunters down a hallway with a butt hanging out the corner
text: of his mouth and a bucket of ice swinging at his side. He
text: pulls up at a door on which the faded numbers read something
dialog: like "Room 404."
text: Ted knocks on the door. After a moment, the latch is thrown
text: and the door swings open. Ted cautiously steps into the dark
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Anybody home?
text: A DEMONIC CACKLE cuts through the darkness.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: No one here but us chickens.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Say, it's pretty dark in here, sir.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: What do you expect, Theodore, a
dialog: fuckin' floor show?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Do I know you?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I don't know. Do you?
text: In a flash the lights switch on and Ted finds himself staring
text: down the barrel of a pretty intense-looking .357 Magnum,
text: cocked and ready to fire. At the other end of the gun stands
text: a 50-year-old man, Sigfried, who sports a Cheshire Cat smile
text: and a "just try fuckin' with me" look on his face. Sigfried
text: isn't the only person in the room. Directly behind him sits
text: a beautiful young woman, Angela, gagged and bound to a chair.
text: Ted drops the bucket to the floor.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I brought your ice.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: That's cute. In fact, the whole
dialog: getup's kind of cute. The monkey
dialog: suit's a nice touch, honey puss.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: This has to be a mistake. Is this
dialog: room 404?
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Theodore? What do you take me for,
dialog: Theodore?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: A very upset man?
text: Sigfried reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of
text: assorted stimulants into his mouth, chewing on them like
text: they were breath mints. Sigfried thrusts his hand forward,
text: gripping Ted by the throat, and leads him to Angela.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (to Angela)
dialog: I am an upset man, Theodore.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How do you know my name, sir?
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: I'm psychic, Theodore.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look my name is Ted, actually, and I
dialog: have no idea what's going on here,
dialog: but I've obviously come at a bad
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Let's not belabor the fact that you
dialog: have no sense of timing, Theodore.
dialog: The fact is you're here.
text: Sigfried turns to Angela.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And I couldn't think of a better
dialog: time for you to introduce me to your
dialog: beau than on New Year's Eve.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh fuck, there's a mistake. You're
dialog: fucking wrong here. My name is
dialog: Theodore, yes! My mother named me
dialog: that and I hate the name. But I'm a
dialog: fucking bellhop. People call me Ted.
dialog: I work here.
text: Suddenly, with great force, Sigfried slams the butt of his
text: pistol smack into Ted's temple, sending him to the floor.
text: Ted looks up at Sigfried in shock.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Look, I'd love to sit here all night
dialog: with you talking about things like
dialog: when you broke in your first mitt --
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That was insensitive of me, wasn't
dialog: it, T H E O D O R E? But let's cut
dialog: to the chase, okay?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: So apologize!
text: A tense silence fills the room. All eyes are on Ted, who
dialog: can't figure out what the fuck this guy wants.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: For what?
text: Sigfried looks hard with disbelief at Ted, who winces back.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: You are really beginning to annoy
dialog: me, Theodore.
text: Sigfried throws another handful of pills into his mouth.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look, obviously you two are working
dialog: something out and if I could help
dialog: you with your problem I would.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: What are you saying? Are you saying
dialog: I got a problem? Are you trying to
dialog: say I don't give her what she needs?
dialog: That I'm FUCKING INSENSITIVE!!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look, is this about another man? Or
dialog: something?
text: Ted has struck a raw nerve. Sigfried's mood swings
text: drastically; he bends down next to Ted.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Let's get our ABC's right, here,
dialog: Theodore. Theodore, right?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ted's better.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Ted, okay... Are you saying my wife
dialog: cheats on me?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I didn't say that... I...
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Oh, for Christ's sake, Theodore,
dialog: this is about as intimate a situation
dialog: as you can get, you, me, and Angela
dialog: here. It's pretty cozy. To say nothing
dialog: of how stupid an idea it is to lie
text: to a man with a loaded gun without
dialog: considering the possible response. I
dialog: demand an apology!
text: The phone rings.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Don't move. I've got to take this.
text: Sigfried glances at it. Then to Angela. He picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: What?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We ain't got any needles here, kid.
dialog: Just a big fucking gun.
text: He listens to the other line, says good-bye, and hangs up.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: Now, where was I? Oh yeah, I remember.
text: Sigfried kneels next to Ted and assumes a prayer position.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: I want you to pray for forgiveness,
dialog: Theodore.
text: Sigfried, hands clasped together, signals for Ted to do the
text: same. The gun lies at his side. Ted considers a bold move,
text: but thinks better of it. Sigfried's eyes pop open. He cuts a
text: look to Ted, signaling him to assume the pose.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now say after me, "I apologize..."
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I apologize...
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: For what?
text: Ted looks to Angela for help. She can only stare back with
text: intense, wide-open eyes.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: For fucking what?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That I said you might have been
dialog: unfaithful?
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: "That I said you might have been
dialog: unfaithful?" Listen, Theodore, you're
dialog: in church here... you're kneeling in
text: front of an altar. Truth... truth is
dialog: all it hears. Say the following, "I,
dialog: Theodore, must humbly and sincerely
dialog: apologize for saying that you fucked
dialog: another man!"
text: Ted repeats what Sigfried has told him. This appears to have
text: a calming effect on Sigfried, who gets up off the floor,
text: turning his face to Angela.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Satisfied?
text: Angela nods.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Do you accept the fucking apology?
text: Naturally, Angela says nothing.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You always gotta get the last word,
dialog: don't you? It's one way with you,
dialog: Angela, isn't it? I give and I give
dialog: and I get nothing back.
text: Sigfried turns to Ted.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: She just sits there waiting for me
dialog: to jump through hoops...
text: Angela attempts to speak through the gag. Both men wait with
text: bated breath for a response. Sigfried's had enough.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Stupid me, for a second I thought
dialog: you were going to say something...
dialog: something like, "I'm sorry." HA!
dialog: "I'm sorry." You're absolutely right,
dialog: love cakes, I wouldn't want it that
dialog: way. That's one thing you can say
dialog: about Angela. She'll never do anything
dialog: she doesn't want to do. If the feeling
dialog: ain't there, she just isn't going to
dialog: do it. There is nothing in this world
dialog: as fucked as a woman who gives when
dialog: she doesn't want to. Never let that
dialog: happen to you, Theodore. It makes
dialog: you feel very little indeed.
text: Ted beckons Sigfried.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You mind if I...?
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Go ahead. Spit it out.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don't mean to upset you further,
dialog: sir, but I think she was trying to
dialog: say yes.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Are you condescending to me, Theodore?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Absolutely not, I would never do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Why don't you just say it?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Say what?
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: That you think I'm an idiot.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I would never say that.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: You think you're superior to me,
dialog: don't ya, Theodore? You don't think
text: I notice there is a gag in the woman's
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Of course you do.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Naturally "of course." And do you
dialog: know how I know that?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How, sir?
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
text: Because I PUT THE GAG IN HER MOUTH!
dialog: I'm gonna let you in on a little
dialog: secret about communication, Theodore.
dialog: It's all in the eyes...
text: (points the gun at
dialog: Ted)
dialog: Him?
text: (turns the gun on
dialog: himself)
dialog: Or me? Him or me? No one? Okay. Let's
dialog: drag it out.
text: Sigfried empties the last of the pills into his mouth, heaving
text: the empty bottle over his shoulder. He takes off, disappearing
text: into the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM
text: Ted finds himself alone with Angela. They lock eyes. Angela
text: implores Ted to lean forward. Ted sizes up the situation:
text: His chances of making it to the door are slim due to the
text: fact that he would have to pass by the bathroom door. Ted
text: paces back and forth in front of Angela, who struggles to
text: get his attention. He whips around and they face off in what
text: appears to be a game of charades. Ted finally gets the point
text: and cautiously removes the gag from Angela's mouth. Angela
text: spits an old sock out.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What!
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: We don't have time to play charades
dialog: here, asshole! Untie me quick.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Listen, lady, I don't know what in
dialog: the hell is going on here, but I'd
dialog: appreciate it if you would explain
dialog: to that nutcase that he's making a
dialog: big mistake.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Look, whether you like it or not,
dialog: you're in the middle of a situation
dialog: here you can't just wish your way
dialog: out of.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But I've never seen you people before,
dialog: we're complete strangers.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
text: Everyone starts out strangers, Ted,
dialog: it's where we end up that counts.
dialog: Hurry up.
text: Ted wrestles with the idea of whether to untie Angela or
dialog: not.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don't know if I can do this. It's
dialog: too hard.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Life is hard, Ted. You ever stopped
dialog: to consider how many times you change
dialog: your underwear in a lifetime?
text: On nervous impulse, Ted begins the calculations.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: I don't mean literally, you ignoramus.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Forget it, listen to me. There's a
text: gun in my suitcase behind the bed,
dialog: it's loaded...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm not going to shoot anybody.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Fine. Get the gun and I'll shoot
dialog: "anybody."
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And make me an accessory in the murder
dialog: of your husband?
text: Ted collapses to his knees in front of Angela.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's not fair. It just isn't fair.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Get a fucking grip on yourself. First
dialog: off, who says he's my husband? And
dialog: second, we are a long way from fair
dialog: here, fair is back in jolly old
text: England eatin' crumpets and sipping
dialog: on tea.
text: Ted collects himself.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Tut. Tut. Tut. Not so fast. Well,
dialog: maybe there are two sides to this
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
text: There are two sides to a plate, still
dialog: you only eat off of one. Now GET THE
dialog: GUN!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So why's he got you tied up?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: I'm a werewolf, Ted! Get the gun!
text: Ted is at a loss as to what to do. Angela turns on the charm.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Come on, Ted. Come over here just
dialog: for a minute. You can do it. Come
dialog: on, Ted. You look like a good guy.
text: Ted creeps towards her.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: That's it, Teddy. You look so much
dialog: more attractive when you're self-
dialog: assured.
text: Sigfried suddenly comes to life... He's heard from the
dialog: bathroom belting out "Life is but a dream... she-boom, she-
dialog: boom."
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (she panics)
dialog: Quick, he's coming back. Put the gag
dialog: back in, and remember the gun!
text: Ted hurries to replace the sock in her mouth.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Nine thousand, three hundred and
dialog: twenty-two times, to the best of my
dialog: estimation.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM
text: Sigfried coughs, sending a chill up Ted's spine. Ted whips
text: around to discover Sigfried leaning up against the door to
dialog: the bathroom.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: I was just beginning to think I could
dialog: trust you, Theodore. Silly me.
text: Ted's fingers are frozen over Angela's lips.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I was just trying to help her breathe
dialog: a little.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Don't let me stop you, Teddy. You
dialog: don't mind me calling you Teddy, do
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's fine.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: I used to have a little bunny rabbit
dialog: named Teddy, it looked real cute
text: nibbling on Angela's ear. Only problem
dialog: here is you're no bunny rabbit,
dialog: Theodore, and it really fuckin' razzes
dialog: me to picture you doin' it. But don't
dialog: let me stop you, Teddy... no need to
dialog: play sneaky-poo.
text: Ted starts to back toward the door.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look, man, if this is some kind of
dialog: Voodoo thing and you want me to have
dialog: sex with your wife, there is
dialog: absolutely no way.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
text: (shouts at the top of
dialog: his lungs)
dialog: I said, nibble, asshole! Now!
text: The directness of Sigfried's command, coupled with the SOUND
text: of a trigger being cocked, forces Ted to approach Angela.
text: Angela is a stunning beauty, and Ted being kind of a shy guy
text: makes for an awkward situation. Ted leans forward. As he
text: closes in, Angela's eyes close.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Sorry, lady.
text: Ted pulls up short of actually nibbling on Angela.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: What's the matter, no whiz left in
dialog: the cheese? I'm not cramping your
dialog: style, am I?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look, I'm not playing this game
dialog: anymore.
text: Sigfried yanks Ted backwards. He wraps his arms around him.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: It's almost all over, Theodore, and
dialog: soon you can go home to Mommy.
text: Ted struggles to free himself from Sigfried's powerful bear
text: hug and blasts out the following monologue.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: My name is not Theodore, it's TED,
scene_heading: TED, TED, T... E... D... TED... NOT
text: TEDDY, NOT THEODORE... TED... Yes,
dialog: my mother did me the service of naming
dialog: me Theodore and I haven't a clue as
dialog: to how you know that because everyone
dialog: who knows that lives a long way away
dialog: from here. Do you have any idea what
dialog: it's like to go to school where all
text: the other kids' parents are in jail
dialog: doing time for crimes like grand
dialog: larceny, aggravated assault, burglary
dialog: and murder, and you get stuck with a
dialog: mother who names you Theodore and
dialog: dressed you up in little matching
dialog: pink outfits with, get this, a little
dialog: blue bow fucking tie! Well, I'll
dialog: tell you what happens. Pretty soon
dialog: Theodore becomes "Theo the Thumper,"
dialog: and when Theo the Thumper gets old
text: enough, he packs his bags and goes
text: thousands of miles away where he can
dialog: put the whole bloody mess behind
dialog: him. So, if you don't mind, shoot me
dialog: now, because no one is going to call
dialog: me that again. My name is Ted, okay?
dialog: Got it? TED!
text: Sigfried has followed the entire tirade in stunned silence.
text: He takes a step toward Ted and offers him his hand.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Sigfried.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: My name is Sigfried.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sigfried?
text: Sigfried cuts a "Something wrong with that?" look at Ted.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Yah, Sigfried.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Nice to meet you, Sigfried.
text: Ted cautiously takes Sigfried's hand.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Very impressive, Ted. "Theo the
dialog: Thumper?"... Ouch. It's a deal, kid.
dialog: Ted it will be.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Thanks.
text: Sigfried holds onto Ted's hand. The soft sound of distant
text: fireworks pops in the background. Car horns and a muffled
text: countdown signal that it's New Year's.
text: Sigfried moves uncomfortably close to Ted and from out of
text: nowhere bolts forward, planting a wet kiss right on Ted's
text: mouth. Something snaps in Sigfried. He is either really
text: getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure.
text: He doubles back on the floors. Ted and Angela watch as he
text: flops around like a flounder with the cocked gun waving all
text: over the place. Ted wipes his mouth with his jacket sleeve
text: while trying to dodge the barrel of the gun.

dialog: You okay, mister? I'll get help!
text: Sigfried manages to steady the gun and point it directly at
text: Ted. He signals for Ted to go to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: That's the wrong door, sir.
text: Sigfried grabs Ted by the leg and shove the barrel of the
text: gun into his crotch.
text: Sigfried pulls Ted's face closer to his.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Get me the nitro... it's in the
dialog: bathroom cabinet. Now!
text: Ted rushes into the bathroom, leaving Sigfried a babbling
dialog: mess behind.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM--SAME TIME
text: Ted enters the bathroom, which appears shaken by an
text: earthquake. Towels and wet clothes are all over the place.
text: An evening gown is flushed halfway down the toilet and pills
text: are everywhere. Sigfried is shouting from the other room to
text: hurry. Ted checks the cabinet, searching for a bottle marked
dialog: "Nitro." No luck.
text: Ted spots a small window set above the toilet.
text: He figures this is the best chance he's got to make a break.
text: Ted goes for it. He manages to get his head and one arm
text: through the window before he gets stuck. His legs dangle in
text: the bathroom. Struggle as he may, he can only hit the toilet-
text: bowl lever, which sends a loud FLUSH SOUND out through the
dialog: apartment.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED (O.S.)
dialog: (shouting in the
dialog: distance)
dialog: It's no time to take a leak, Teddy,
dialog: I'm fucking dying here!
scene_heading: EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW--NIGHT
text: Outside the window, Ted's in another world. He's almost safe.
text: It's a strange feeling, kind of like bathing in warm water
text: in paradise, knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass
text: off. He can see the flickering red glowing light from the
text: witches' room from the floor below.
scene_heading: EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND BELOW--NIGHT
text: Ted sees Eva bopping naked past the window. He shouts her
text: name out, to no avail.
text: The MUSIC drowns out his voice and they ignore his calls for
text: help. The blood rushes to his head. He lets himself hang
text: there for a moment. He wonders how many other people have
dialog: found themselves in situations like this before him. Probably
text: everyone. Right next to his face, Ted recognizes a bloody
text: hand print. It's not his blood.
scene_heading: EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND ABOVE--NIGHT
text: Ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around,
text: spotting a young man (previously seen as the Yuppie Scumbag
text: on the phone) leaning out of the window directly above him.
text: After a quick moment of sizing him up, Ted gathers himself.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hi...
text: No answer. Something's wrong with the guy, all the blood is
text: drained from his face and he is mumbling something.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Listen, I'm stuck here in a situation
dialog: that I can't even begin to explain,
dialog: but would you be so kind as to get
dialog: help? Could you call the police,
dialog: please?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You okay?
text: The young man manages to belt out the word "ice" just before
text: hurling a mouthful of vomit toward Ted. It takes all Ted's
text: strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into the
text: bathroom. He falls back on the floor.
text: He props himself up and checks for damage. He notices
text: something odd... the room is silent. No Sigfried. He walks
text: into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BEDROOM--MOMENTS LATER
text: Ted looks around the still room. No one's there.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sigfried?
text: He heads toward the door and, from out of the corner of his
text: eye, he spots Sigfried's hairy leg. Sigfried has passed out
text: on the floor. Angela's chair has been knocked on its side.
text: Ted races over to help lift her back up. He pulls the gag
text: from her mouth. Angela jumps all over him.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Where's the fucking nitro?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I couldn't find it!
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: You took long enough. Untie me, for
dialog: Christ's sake, you fucking upset him
text: and he's dying.
text: Ted struggles to untie Angela.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I thought you wanted to kill him.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: You'd make a great cop, Theodore.
dialog: The knots are all over the place and a real bitch to untie.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I can't handle this alone, I'd better
dialog: get help.
text: Ted turns on a dime and runs smack into Sigfried, who's been
text: taking in the whole conversation.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: I tie a pretty good knot, don't I,
dialog: Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Thank God you're okay...
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Never felt better.
text: Angela hears Sigfried's voice from behind her back.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: You bastard!
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (to Angela)
dialog: Come on, honey, don't get mad. It
dialog: was just a little test, and I'm glad
dialog: I did it because now I'll know forever
dialog: that you really do love me. Truly
text: and deeply.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: If the simple fact that I didn't
dialog: want your bloated, dead body lying
text: out on the floor is love, then no
dialog: wonder we find ourselves as we are
dialog: at this very fucking moment.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Oh, no. I heard you and there was
dialog: genuine care in that voice. Can't be
dialog: denied. Can it, Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I think you're right and, if you
dialog: just keep this kind of open dialogue
dialog: going, you'll go a long way to
dialog: resolving this misunderstanding.
text: Ted edges his way toward the door.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You'd be surprised what happens when
dialog: people just listen to each other
dialog: without succumbing to all that pain
dialog: and anger.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: You heard shit, monkey boy. Easy for
dialog: you to say after you fuck another
dialog: man's wife. You should at least have
dialog: the guts to stand by your convictions.
text: Sigfried turns an icy eye on Ted, who has given up all hope
dialog: of ever getting out of the room.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's a lie, Sigfried. I swear to
dialog: God.
text: Angela continues her tirade.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: When I think of all the times you
dialog: were inside me promising me a better
dialog: life, it makes me want to puke.
text: Sigfried slowly raises his gun, pointing it directly at Ted's
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why are you doing this? What have I
dialog: ever done to you people?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: What didn't you do, stick man?
dialog: Unfortunately, you don't have the
dialog: balls to back up the actions of your
text: huge cock.
text: The words hit Sigfried like bullets to the chest... his legs
dialog: weaken.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (whimpering)
dialog: He's got a huge cock?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: She's lying again, mister. It's not
dialog: that big.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Show it to me.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Come on, man, she's lying. Can't you
dialog: see she's fucking with you?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Put it this way, God made up for
dialog: what he did to Gumby with Ted here.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Show it to me.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Show him your cock, Theodore.
text: Sigfried runs over to Angela and kneels in front of her.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Stop talking about his cock, will
dialog: you?!
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: It's hard to stop talking about
dialog: something so huge. I could go on and
dialog: on about his cock, bone, nob, bishop,
dialog: wang, thang, hotrod. Hump mobile,
dialog: Oscar, dong, dagger, banana, cucumber,
dialog: salami. Sausage, kielbasa, schlong,
dialog: dink, tool, Big Ben, Mister Happy,
dialog: prick, disk, pecker, peter, pee-pee,
dialog: wee-wee, weiner, pisser, pistol,
dialog: joint, hose, horn, middle-leg, third-
text: leg, meat, stick, joystick, dipstick.
text: Angela is on a roll. She fires the words at Sigfried, hitting
text: him pointblank. He staggers. He pleads with her to stop,
text: covering his ears. Ted watches the man crumble.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Junior, the little head, little guy,
dialog: Rumple Foreskin, Tootsie Roll. Snake,
text: one-eyed monster, one-eyed wonder,
dialog: shaft, sword, meat whistle, skin
dialog: flute, love muscle, Roto-Rooter,
dialog: instrument, banger, rammer, ramrod,
dialog: cherrypicker, log, pole.
text: Sigfried tries jamming the sock back in her mouth to stop
text: the flow; she manages to give him a "fuck of a bite" in the
text: process. Meanwhile, Ted figures this to be his moment to
text: make a move and bolts for the door, only to be tackled by
text: Sigfried at the one-yard line. After a struggle, the two men
text: rest on the floor, catching their breath in a relaxed embrace.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Please, don't leave me. I'll call
dialog: you Ted from now on.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's not me, mister, I swear.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Personally, I don't give a fuck,
dialog: Ted, it's just I don't want to be
dialog: alone right now. I'm feeling a little
dialog: vulnerable.
text: Sigfried heaves the gun over his shoulder, grabs a half-empty
text: bottle of Jack Daniel's, and passes it to Ted, who takes a
dialog: hit.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: No guns, okay? Just you and me, Ted.
dialog: You know my father used to say that
dialog: forgiveness is the only thing that
dialog: evil can't sink its teeth into.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's beautiful.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Kind of nice down here on the floor,
dialog: isn't it, Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes, actually.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Things take on a whole new
dialog: perspective... You'd like my trust,
dialog: wouldn't you, Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes I would.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: I just got one thing to ask you and
dialog: I'll let you go.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay. Okay.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Tell me straight now.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: What was it like?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What was what like?
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: You know, you and her.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, for fuck sake, Sigfried, what do
dialog: you want me to say?
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Either way you're fucked, right? You
dialog: ever gonna see her again, Theodore?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: If I ever saw her again, I'd run the
dialog: other way.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Promise?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I promise.
text: Sigfried releases Ted and stands up.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: You're lying, but I can respect that,
dialog: Ted. If you told me, it would no
dialog: longer be a secret, and secrets have
dialog: a power, kid. You open that box and
text: they disappear forever. A bad secret
dialog: will rip you apart, but the good one
dialog: are all you got. In the end, when
dialog: all the people you knew are dead and
dialog: gone, all you'll have left are you
dialog: secrets. And when you die, the box
text: is open and it all blows away --
dialog: dust to dust -- all the anger,
dialog: jealousy, desire and love just blow
dialog: away.
text: Sigfried throws his hand out to help Ted up.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: So you know what I say, let's call
dialog: it a truce, kiddo.
text: Sigfried takes Ted by the hand and leads him to an open
text: window. Ted is overcome by the sweetness in Sigfried's voice
text: and follows him to the window willingly.
text: The two men look out into the dark Los Angeles night.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm a man of love, Theodore. Love is
dialog: all I live for.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I can see that.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Maybe to a fault.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Don't beat yourself up over it.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: That's nice of you to say, Ted, but
dialog: I probably should make a clean break
dialog: of it, cut her loose and get my own
dialog: place. I just can't imagine living
dialog: without her. Do you think I should
dialog: seek professional help?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's not for everyone, but maybe in
dialog: your case it could help.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: You ever been out on the ocean at
dialog: night?
text: Ted shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I have... scary as a motherfucker,
dialog: all that darkness around you. It's
text: like a big black carpet rolled out
dialog: as far as the eye can see. Sometimes,
dialog: if you're lucky, you'll see a light.
dialog: It could be as small as a little
dialog: spark, but it will cut a path straight
dialog: through all that blackness, straight
dialog: to you. It could be another boat, or
text: some distant fire on an island, but
dialog: that light will shed a shining path
dialog: of diamonds cutting through mile
text: after mile of darkness to lie at
dialog: your feet. That's love, Ted, it's
text: like a path of light in an ocean of
dialog: darkness.
text: Ted and Sigfried stare out of the window in peace, transfixed
text: by the glimmering lights of the city. A loud SHOT rings out,
text: shattering the still moment. The two men spin around. Angela
text: stands there with a smoking gun hanging at her side.
text: Sigfried drops to his knees. Ted checks him out, no blood.
text: Angela has fired the gun into the floor below. Ted looks up
text: at Angela. Angela opens the chamber of the pistol and hands
dialog: the bullets to Ted.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: You'd better go check to see if I
dialog: killed anybody downstairs.
text: Sigfried is bent over, silently weeping on the floor.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You people gonna be okay?
text: Angela sits next to Sigfried and gently strokes his back.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: We're fine, Ted.
text: Ted points to a tray with half-eaten food on it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Would you like me to...?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Another time, Ted.
text: Ted slowly walks toward the door and takes one last look at
text: the strange couple at rest in the corner of the room before
text: closing the door behind him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY--MOMENTS LATER
text: Ted walks down the hallway, lost in thought. An energetic
text: Young Guy with a bouquet of flowers plows into him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GUY
dialog: Happy New Year, buddy.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Happy New Year.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GUY
dialog: I was just in room 404, what a party!
dialog: You know where room 409 is at?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Beats me. It's somewhere around here.
text: The guy takes off in the direction Ted's walking from. Ted
text: suddenly realizes who this guy is and whips around, shouting
dialog: to the Young Guy.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey, what's your name?
text: The door SLAMS on room 409.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: STORY TITLE CARD:
speaker_heading: ROOM 716
dialog: "THE MISBEHAVERS"
speaker_heading: FADE UP
speaker_heading: THE FRONT DESK
text: SUPER: 10:30 p.m.
text: Ted is relaxing at the front desk. He breathes slowly. He
text: finally has one moment's peace after an already long night.
text: He even has a chance to straighten his tie.
text: The phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: TED
text: Front desk.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ROOM 716
text: CLOSE-UP of a cigarette hanging out of a Man's mouth as he
text: speaks into the telephone.
speaker_heading: MAN
text: Bottle of Moet et Chandon. Fast.
text: Man hangs up the phone and stubs out his cigarette into an
text: already overstuffed ashtray by the bed. Man turns around to
text: face the camera. He is a dark and handsome Latin male in his
text: mid-30s. Dangerous. Impatient.
text: He walks toward the camera as he continues straightening his
dialog: tie.
text: He stops at the door of the bathroom and watches his Wife
text: and two kids get ready for the party. Wife seems to be a
text: beautiful woman in her mid-30s. The children are Sarah, nine,
dialog: and Juancho, six.
text: Man strikes up another cigarette and finishes his tie.
text: He watches his Wife comb Juancho's hair down and to the side
text: like an idiot.
text: Not being able to stand it anymore, Man tears Juancho away
text: from his Wife and snatches the comb.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Give me that...
text: Man begins to slick Juancho's hair back.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: There... see? You look cool with
dialog: your hair up like this. Like me...
text: Juancho is smiling now. He's happy he's going to look like
dialog: his dad.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Not down and to the side, all stupid
dialog: like your mom likes to comb it.
text: Juancho looks over at Sarah, who is going through the tortuous
text: ritual of having her mother brush the tangles out of her
text: long, unmanageable hair.
text: Wife seems to be taking out her aggressions on the tangled
dialog: mess.
text: Man is starting to have problems of his own with Juancho's
text: hair. Juancho's hair is thinner than Man's, so it won't stay
dialog: up.
text: Man puts down his cigarette in order to get a better handle
text: on it. We see the frustration growing in his face.
text: Juancho picks up the cigarette and pretends he's smoking
text: too, just like his dad.
text: Man tears the cigarette away from Juancho and smokes it down
text: to the filter. He looks at his own cool hair, and then down
text: at Juancho's, which won't stay up.
text: Man flicks the cigarette butt into the toilet in frustration.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You've got your mother's hair.
text: In anger, Man starts messing up Juancho's hair.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I can't do anything with it.
text: Furious, Man simply swipes Juancho's hair back down and to
text: the side, the way Wife had it before. Juancho looks like an
dialog: idiot again.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: There. Go.
text: Juancho slouches past everyone as he exits the bathroom.
text: Sarah watches him leave as her own hair is finished.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: (putting a plastic
dialog: clip in Sarah's hair)
dialog: There. Go.
text: Sarah exits.
text: Wife then finishes her own gorgeous hair. Man lights up a
dialog: new cigarette.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: So, are we gonna have fun tonight?
text: Man blows smoke in Wife's face as he walks out of the
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I didn't think so.
text: Sarah has joined Juancho in watching television.
text: Man watches the children watch TV. We can see the wheels
text: turning in Man's head.
text: He turns back to the bathroom.
text: He watches Wife now. Wheels turning. Practically burning
dialog: rubber.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hey.
text: Wife puts the lipstick down and turns to her husband. She is
dialog: beautiful.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Let's just leave the kids here.
text: Wife glances out at the children, eyes glued to the tube.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Here in the room? By themselves?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: No... with the television.
text: Wife thinks about it for a second. She shrugs a "sure."
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You want to have fun tonight, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: They'll be fine.
text: He kisses Wife's face and exits the bathroom. She covers the
text: wet spot with more cake makeup.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hey.
text: The children turn to face him.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You guys are going to stay here and
dialog: watch TV.
text: The children look at each other.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I want you to be in bed asleep before
dialog: twelve. Your mother and I will be
dialog: back later on.
text: Wife goes straight for the door.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Okay?
text: He blows one kiss. One for both of them.
text: As Man and his Wife walk out the door, Man turns back to the
dialog: children...
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Don't misbehave.
text: He closes the door.
text: Sarah stands in the middle of the room. She's looking at the
text: door Man and Wife just disappeared through. Stunned.
text: Her dress looks frilly and beautifully uncomfortable. She
text: touches the edges of the fabric.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Why did we have to get all dressed
dialog: up if we weren't going with them?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Man and Wife are walking down the hall.
text: Man stops in his tracks. Wife stops too and looks at Man.
text: They wait.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ROOM 716
text: Juancho shuts off the television. He drops the remote to the
text: floor. His attention is on the fireworks outside. He leaps
text: to the window and begins unlatching it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
text: Escaping. Stinks in here, anyway.
text: Man bursts through the door of the hotel room and stands in
text: the doorway, glaring at the mischievous Juancho.
text: Juancho bangs his head on the window trying to get back
text: inside. He leaps to the floor and tries to turn on the TV
text: with the remote.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (stern)
dialog: What did I say?
text: Juancho turns to Man as if he'd been sitting there watching
dialog: television the whole time.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Behave.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: Yes, Papa.
text: Ted appears at the door with Man's champagne.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The champagne you ordered, sir.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: No time for this. Leave it on ice.
text: Ted proceeds to place the champagne in the room.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: But I want some now...
text: Ted is torn. Man pushes him into the room.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: There'll be plenty for you and the
dialog: party, baby, you can bomb yourself
dialog: all you want at the party.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: What a waste.
text: Ted places the bucket near the bed. After setting up the
text: bottle, he turns to leave, but now Man closes the door,
text: trapping Ted inside with them.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: Hey.
text: Ted looks around, bewildered. Now what?
text: Man is reaching into his coat pocket.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You want five hundred bucks?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sure!
text: Man hesitates a moment, then pulls out his wallet. That was
dialog: too easy.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: How about three?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Three hundred?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Three's good.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: My children are staying here tonight
dialog: watching TV. I want you to check up
text: on them every thirty minutes.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Check up on 'em?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Make sure they're all right, make
dialog: sure they're fed, make sure they go
dialog: to bed.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We can call out and hire a babysitter.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I don't trust babysitters. My children
dialog: are safer alone than with some fucked-
dialog: up pedophile babysitter I don't know
dialog: from the man in the fucking moon.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: What about him? What makes you think
dialog: you can trust him?
text: Man grabs Ted's face and tilts it torward Wife.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Tell me that's not a face you can
dialog: trust.
text: Man lets go of Ted's face. He feels his jaw. It's still there.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look, sir, I'd like to help you out,
dialog: but I really can't. I'm all alone
dialog: here tonight.
text: Man whips out his wallet and counts out money in Ted's face.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: One hundred... two hundred... three
dialog: hundred...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I thought you said five hundred.
text: Man glares at Ted.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I said three hundred.
text: Ted doesn't back down.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No, you distinctly said five hundred.
text: The angrier Man gets, the quieter he talks.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You calling me a liar?
text: Ted, while not backing down, massages the situation.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No, I'm not saying you're lying. I'm
dialog: saying you accidentally forgot that
dialog: what you first said was five hundred.
dialog: Man has never been challenged like this by a fuckin' bellboy.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I don't do anything accidentally,
dialog: jerk. I might've first said five
dialog: hundred, but what I last said was
dialog: three hundred, and what you say last
dialog: is what counts.
text: Ted not only doesn't back down, but psychologically pokes
text: his finger in the scary Man's chest.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well then, if you say five hundred
dialog: one last time, we got a deal.
text: Man's eyes narrow. He physically pokes his finger in Ted's
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You fuckin' with me, Pendejo?
text: Now Ted takes a step backwards.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No, not at all. It's New Year's Eve
dialog: and I'm here alone. If there was
dialog: somebody else here, no problem, but
dialog: I'm by myself. And looking after
dialog: your kids is a pain in the ass I
dialog: don't need --
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You callin' my kids a pain in the
dialog: ass?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: -- No, they're not a pain in the
dialog: ass, it's the situation that's a
dialog: pain in the ass.
text: Man drops the tenseness.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: No, you were right the first time.
dialog: You win, tough guy, five hundred.
text: Man respects Ted for not backing down, but not insulting him
text: either. A skill Man never learned. Wife shoots a look at the
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: You kids are getting expensive.
text: Juancho turns back to the TV.
text: Sarah stares down Wife.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (looking at name tag)
dialog: What's your name? Ted?
text: CLOSE-UP of name tag.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah. It's Ted.
text: Man tears off Ted's name tag and throws it to children.
speaker_heading: MAN

dialog: His name is Ted. If you need anything,
dialog: dial 0 and ask for Ted.
text: Sarah catches the name tag and reads the name on it: "TED --
dialog: BELLHOP."
text: Sarah looks up at Ted. She clips the pin to her dress and
text: smiles shyly at him.
text: Man puts the money in Ted's pocket and then grabs his ear,
text: pulling him close.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (deadly whisper)
dialog: If something happens to my children,
dialog: I wouldn't want to be you.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Make sure they're in bed before
dialog: midnight.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Before midnight? Then should I wake
dialog: them up for the countdown to the New
dialog: Year?
text: Wife looks disgusted.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: No...
text: As Man and Wife exit, he turns to the kids and says:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Don't misbehave.
text: Man closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Man and Wife book it down the hall before Ted can change his
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: ROOM 716
text: Ted is standing facing the door the Man and Wife just
text: disappeared through. He turns around slowly to face the
dialog: children.
text: His eyes are wide. His face is quiet. Stern.
text: The children are staring at him.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay. These are the rules. Don't
dialog: break the rules and I won't break
dialog: your necks.
text: The kids look at each other.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I always wanted to say that. Someone
dialog: said that to me when I was a kid.
text: Sarah laughs at his joke.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Except they were joking. I'm not.
text: Ted goes to the door.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The rules are simple. Don't do
dialog: anything you wouldn't do if your
dialog: parents were here. If there's an
dialog: emergency, call me on the phone,
dialog: like your dad said.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That's not what he said.
text: Ted's surprised by a challenge this early in the game.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: He said to call if we need anything.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, I've got a lot of work to do
dialog: and I can't have you calling me every
dialog: time you want a drink of water, so
dialog: please limit your calls to emergencies
dialog: only.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We paid you five hundred dollars.
dialog: We'll call you if we need anything.
dialog: You don't want to upset my dad.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay. Please. Try to call only when
dialog: necessary. Watch TV, and if you're
dialog: good, I'll bring up some milk and
dialog: cookies. Bye.
text: Ted leaves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Ted walks briskly down the hall, counting his money the whole
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOM
text: Juancho takes off his socks and shoes and throws them onto
text: the floor. Sarah looks at the discarded shoes and socks.
text: CLOSE ON the shoes and socks.
text: Sarah looks over at Juancho's bare feet. Her nose twitches.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Your feet stink.
text: Juancho smells his feet.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: They don't stink.
text: Sarah throws his shoes and socks behind her. They land on
dialog: the bed.
text: Juancho is flipping channels and finds an interesting show.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: Check it out. T &amp; A.
text: Sarah realizes he found a Nudie station.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Change it. You're not supposed to
dialog: watch this.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: We're supposed to watch TV.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Not this kind of TV. Change it.
text: Juancho rolls up in a ball, the remote tucked in some recess
text: of his stomach.
text: Sarah hits him, then goes to the phone. She punches 0, sits
text: on the bed, and checks the name on the name tag pinned to
dialog: her shirt.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: FRONT DESK
text: Ted walks up to the front desk just as the phone rings.
speaker_heading: TED
text: Front desk.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM
text: Sarah is taking off her white winter tights.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Ted? Hi. It's me, Sarah. You're our
dialog: sitter for tonight.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, Jesus, what did I tell you? I
dialog: said if you don't bother me, you'll
dialog: get milk and cookies. Now, do you
dialog: want them or do you not?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I want you to turn off the Nudie
dialog: station in our room.
text: Ted checks the computer.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (reading stats on
dialog: room 716)
dialog: I can't turn on an adult station
dialog: without permission from your parents.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No.
dialog: (struggling with winter
dialog: tights)
dialog: Not turn it on, turn it off. It's
text: already on.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's not what the machine tells
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Well, stop listening to the machine
dialog: and listen to me. There's naked ladies
dialog: dancing on my TV and I want 'em off.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: If you're good, you'll get milk and
dialog: cookies, so leave me alone, please.
dialog: I'll be up later to put you both to
dialog: sleep.
text: He hangs up.
speaker_heading: ROOM 716
text: Angry, Sarah slams down the phone. She has an unusually adult
text: temper. We know where she gets it from. She looks up and
text: sees that the nudies are still in full force.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Change the channel, now!
text: Juancho turns around. He has a face like someone just laid a
text: fart in his nose.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: Man, you're the one with the stinky
dialog: feet.
text: Sarah smells her feet. Twice.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: They don't stink.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: Yeah, they do.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Here, smell for yourself.
text: She sticks her foot out for Juancho to smell. He's reluctant.
dialog: Fearful.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Go ahead.
text: He slowly, very slowly... climbs onto the bed and lowers his
text: head to her foot. Very slowly.
text: Sarah waits until he's close enough to her foot before she
text: kicks him in the face, sending him somersaulting off the bed
text: and crashing to the floor.
text: She grabs the remote control he left behind and changes the
text: channel to a cartoon.
text: Juancho gets up and realizes his defeat. He decides to wander
dialog: about. Looking for something to do...
text: Sarah tries to ignore him as he stalks the room. It's only a
text: matter of time before he finds mischief.
text: Juancho sees the champagne bucket and Bingo!, he goes for
dialog: the bottle.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: (holding up the bottle)
dialog: Hey, get a bottle opener!
text: Sarah opens her mouth, as if about to tell him to leave the
text: champagne alone. She stops herself when she realizes she
dialog: wants some champagne too.
text: She quickly scrambles about for a bottle opener while Juancho
text: unwraps the bottle top.
text: Sarah opens the dresser drawer with such force that a few
text: hidden contents long forgotten in the back of the drawer
dialog: slide forward.
text: Some coins, a paperclip, and a hypodermic needle. She looks
text: down at the needle that lays beside the Gideon Bible and
text: casually picks the phone back up and punches 0. The phone
dialog: rings.
speaker_heading: FRONT DESK
text: Ted, bucket of ice in his hand, gets ready to go to room
text: 404. As he crosses the desk, the phone rings. He looks at
text: the board and see room 716's light blinking.
text: He sighs in exasperation.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM
text: Sarah sees Juancho shaking the champagne bottle violently.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don't shake it!
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Ted? Hi. It's me. Sarah.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah. Who died? No one? Then don't
dialog: call me.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I thought I'd tell you that your
text: cleaning ladies are doing a bum job.
dialog: There's all kinds of leftover stuff
dialog: around here.
text: Sarah picks up the needle and rolls it over in her hand
dialog: several times.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Needles and things. We're not supposed
dialog: to have needles here, are we? I mean,
dialog: they don't come with the room, do
dialog: they? Send someone up here to clean
dialog: this place up right.
text: The champagne bottle explodes all over Juancho. He looks
dialog: surprised.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (to Juancho)
dialog: I TOLD YOU NOT TO SHAKE IT!
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: I gotta go. My brother just exploded
dialog: the champagne all over the room. Oh,
dialog: and bring us a couple of toothbrushes.
dialog: There's a card in the bathroom that
dialog: says you'll bring free toothbrushes
dialog: if we ask for them.
text: She hangs up.
text: A frustrated Ted hangs up the phone. He walks briskly to the
dialog: elevator.
text: Sarah and Juancho are pouring themselves champagne. They
text: turn up the television and drink. Juancho shudders at the
text: taste, but tries to drink as much as Sarah.
text: Sarah clearly doesn't like it, but tries to pretend she does.
text: Sarah picks up an instruction card near the phone to see how
dialog: to make room-to-room calls.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm calling another room, give me
dialog: three numbers.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: 4-0-9.
text: Sarah punches in the room number. The phone rings.
text: She holds the needle up to the light to examine it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hello? Hi. You don't know me, and I
dialog: don't know you, but... do you have
dialog: any needles? We've got needles here
dialog: and I was wondering if they come
dialog: with the room or not. Don't have
dialog: any? Thanks. Just checking.
text: She hangs up.
text: Juancho puts down his champagne glass and searches his
text: father's coat pocket. He finds a pack of cigarettes and takes
text: one out. He puts it in his mouth and pretends to smoke.
text: Sarah checks out the hypodermic needle carefully. She has an
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
text: In the bathroom, Sarah seeks out her mother's lipstick.
speaker_heading: ROOM 716
text: Sarah stands atop the chest of drawers and uses the lipstick
text: to draw a bull's-eye on one of the hotel art paintings. She
text: writes numbers next to each circle representing points.
text: Juancho is standing at the foot of the bed, cigarette hanging
text: out of his mouth, as he practices his dart-throwing technique.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (pointing out the
dialog: rules)
dialog: The center is the bull's eye, 100
dialog: points, this one's 10 points, this
dialog: one's 20 points.
text: WHACK! The needle lands an inch from her face in the 20-point
dialog: slot.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hey, wait a minute. Let me get out
dialog: of the way!
text: Sarah, a little tipsy now, grabs the needle and staggers to
text: the bed. She hears the key in the doorway and throws the
text: needle into the curtain to hide it.
text: Ted enters the room, somewhat disheveled from his encounter
text: with Sigfried. He has a tray and a new bottle of champagne.
text: He puts the champagne bottle into the empty bucket. He spots
text: the original bottle lying on the floor half empty and dripping
text: into the carpet.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I brought you some milk and cookies.
dialog: If you want some you have to eat
dialog: them now, because you're going to
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We're going to sleep now?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Your parents said put you to bed
dialog: before midnight. Well, it's before
dialog: midnight. Maybe that way you'll leave
dialog: me alone.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Those aren't milk and cookies.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We were out of cookies, so I brought
dialog: you milk and Saltines. Don't complain!
dialog: Now hurry up and eat. You're going
dialog: to bed right now.
text: Juancho bites into a Saltine. Sarah simply examines one.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: These are old.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: They're stale.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Dip 'em in the milk! The milk will
dialog: make them soft.
text: Sarah gives up and throws the cracker back onto the tray.
text: She's a little drunk.
text: Ted picks up the ruined champagne bottle.
text: Juancho dips his crackers and eats them. He makes a face and
text: drops a soggy cracker onto the tray.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No crackers? Okay, fine. Sleepy time.
dialog: Now, I don't want you guys wandering
dialog: around, so if you need to go to the
dialog: restroom, go now.
text: They go to the bathroom. Ted sits on the bed. Waits.
text: He sees the painting on the wall but can't figure out what's
dialog: different about it.
text: The red lipstick blends right into the aesthetic value of
dialog: the painting.
text: Ted smells something funny. He looks down and sees the socks
text: on the bed. He grabs a fork from the tray and uses it to
text: throw the socks across the room.
text: The kids come back out.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: What about our pajamas?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You wanna look nice in case there's
dialog: an earthquake, don'tcha?
text: The children nod.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay. Then stay in those clothes.
text: The kids lie on the bed.
text: Sarah notices a jar of Mentholatum ointment on the dinner
dialog: tray.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, this is just some Mentholatum
dialog: ointment. Come on, under the covers.
dialog: Close your eyes and I'll tell you a
dialog: story.
text: The children close their eyes. Ted opens the jar of the
text: ointment and sniffs it.
text: Strong stuff by the look on his face.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Your dad says he doesn't trust
dialog: babysitters. I don't blame him. You
dialog: know what my babysitter did to me
dialog: once?
dialog: (confiding)
dialog: I never told my parents, either.
text: The children lie in the bed, eyes closed, listening intently.
text: Ted dips his fingers in the jar of vaporous ointment.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I hated going to sleep. You know,
dialog: it's nighttime and you wanna run
dialog: around and act crazy. So what my
dialog: babysitter did to make sure I'd go
dialog: to sleep and not be tempted to get
dialog: up, was, she'd take some of this
dialog: vapor rub stuff... Can you smell
dialog: this?
text: Eyes closed, the kids inhale. They smell the ointment and
dialog: nod yes.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, she'd just dab a little of
dialog: this over each eyelid, so that I
dialog: would be sure and keep my eyes closed
dialog: all night.
text: Ted is spreading the ointment over their eyelids as he says
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: There. Now you've got some, too!
dialog: Don't open your eyes or it'll burrrn,
dialog: burn, burn. The smell helps clear
dialog: your sinuses too, so it's doing double
dialog: duty.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: What happens when it's morning?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: If you keep your eyes closed all
dialog: night, it will wear off by morning.
dialog: But DON'T OPEN YOUR EYES BEFORE
dialog: THAT...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Did you ever open your eyes?
text: Extreme CLOSE-UP on Ted's eyes.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes... I did.
text: The children are quiet.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And now look at me.
speaker_heading: CHILDREN
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: We can't.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Good. You'll do just fine. Sleep
dialog: well and I won't tell your parents
dialog: about the champagne.
text: Ted leaves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: AFTER A MOMENT OF DARKNESS
text: After a moment of darkness, the night is disturbed by the
text: loud crashing of fireworks outside the window.
text: Sarah sits up, eyes closed. Her face feels the warmth coming
text: from the window and she tilts her head toward it.
text: The light of the fireworks dances its reflections off her
dialog: face.
text: She inhales deeply... then makes a sour face. She goes for
text: the bathroom, arms outstretched like a blind girl. She gets
text: to the bathroom, turns on the light, and searches for the
dialog: sink.
text: She begins to wash the ointment off her eyes very carefully.
text: She dries her eyes thoroughly and opens them... checks them
text: in the mirror. A little red, but otherwise fine.
text: She goes back into the bedroom, turns on the television and
text: grabs the new champagne bottle. She shakes it violently.
text: Juancho wakes. He turns his head to her. His eyes are still
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: Are you watching TV?
text: The champagne bottle explodes. She pours herself a glass.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yep. If you wanna watch too, you
dialog: have to go wash your face.
text: Juancho gets up smiling and tries to run to the bathroom. He
text: slams into the wall, hard.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Be careful...
text: Juancho walks into the bathroom a little slower, more
dialog: cautious.
text: Sarah pours herself another glass. She downs the glass and
text: shudders.
text: She smells the bad smell again. Only now she really smells
dialog: it.
text: She smells her feet. Nothing. She smells the champagne.
dialog: Nothing.
text: Juancho enters the room and sits on the bed. Sarah grabs his
text: foot and smells it.
text: She drops his foot.
text: Juancho stares blankly at her.
text: Sarah looks down at the mattress. She smells the mattress.
text: Juancho looks at her as if she's drunk.
text: Sarah leaps off the bed and turns on the room lights. She
text: takes a huge swig from the champagne bottle, then stalks
text: toward the mattress.
text: Juancho leaps off the bed as well and stands back.
text: Sarah pulls the mattress off of the bedsprings enough to see
text: what is underneath it.
text: Juancho screams. Sarah is too stunned to scream. Stuffed
text: into the bedsprings is a woman's dead and beaten corpse.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: Ted's phone ringing.
text: Ted looks at the phone as if pondering whether or not to
text: answer it. He taps his fingers. Finally he answers the phone.
speaker_heading: ROOM 716
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Ted!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What do you want now, for Christ's
dialog: sake! Who died?
speaker_heading: SARAH

dialog: I don't know, but she's in my bed!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You saw the body?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Impossible. You've got ointment on
dialog: your eyes! You can't see shit! Now
dialog: go to sleep!
text: Ted hangs up the phone.
text: Sarah redials.
text: Ted answers.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Godammit, go to sleep!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (crying now)
dialog: I washed it off...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You washed off the ointment?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (pissed, drunk)
dialog: Yeah, didn't you ever think to do
dialog: that?
text: Ted is quiet on the line. Thinking.
text: Juancho lights up a cigarette for real and takes nervous
text: puffs.
text: Sarah carries the phone over to Juancho and snatches the
text: cigarette away from him. She stuffs it in her own mouth and
text: nervously takes a long drag on it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (through cigarette)
dialog: You never tried it, did you? Then
dialog: you agree I'm smarter than you...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: All right. Now you listen to me...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Get your ass up here and call the
dialog: police, because there's a dead body
dialog: in my bed and it smells like shit
dialog: and it looks even worse, and if you
dialog: don't help us, my dad is gonna lay
dialog: you down right next to her, I swear
dialog: to fucking God!
text: She drinks from her champagne bottle. She's pulling the
text: mattress back over the corpse again.
speaker_heading: JUANCHO
dialog: Go, sis.
dialog: She's drunk all right.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (incensed)
dialog: I'm coming up and if there isn't a
dialog: dead body by the time I get there,
dialog: I'll make one myself. You!
speaker_heading: FRONT DESK
text: Ted slams down the phone.
text: As he walks away from the counter, he spots the children's

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh shit!
text: Ted breaks into a sprint and dives into a closing elevator.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ROOM 716

speaker_heading: ELEVATOR

speaker_heading: LOBBY

speaker_heading: ROOM 716

text: onto the floor.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What the fuck is going on??!!
text: He sees Juancho with the cigarette hanging out of his mouth
text: and rips it away from him. The butt goes flying onto the
text: carpet near the spreading champagne spill.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Your parents are on their way up and
dialog: I'm not taking responsibility for
dialog: this mess!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Check under the mattress!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (crying)
dialog: For the body, can't you smell it?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's your feet!
text: Sarah grabs the mattress and pulls it off herself.
text: Ted sees the rotting corpse.
text: Vomit spews out of Ted's mouth.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (gurgles through vomit-
dialog: spewing lips)
dialog: Jesus fucking Christ! What the fuck
dialog: is this?
text: He tears at the phone.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Police, it's an emergency!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Hello, Police, this is the Mon Signor
dialog: Hotel, get someone up here right
dialog: fucking now, there's a DEAD WHORE
dialog: stuffed under the mattress!
text: Tears well in Sarah's eyes as she looks at the body.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don't call her that...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: I'm dead fucking serious, there's a
dialog: dead fucking Whore stuffed in the
dialog: bedsprings of the fucking bed!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Stop calling her that!!
text: Sarah grabs the hypodermic needle from under the curtain and
text: stabs it into Ted's leg.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: FUCK!!
text: Sarah steps back, almost tripping over the champagne bottle.
text: She picks up the bottle and holds it defensively in case Ted
text: tries to retaliate. Ted spins around, now noticing the needle
text: sticking out of his leg.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Jesus!!
text: Juancho lights up another cigarette.
text: The champagne spill has spread to the fallen cigarette butt.
text: The carpet bursts into flames around the spill.

speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: ROOM 716
text: Ted tries to pull the syringe out of his leg, but yanking it
text: makes it break in two, the plunger in his hand, and the needle
text: still stuck in his leg.
text: Ted staggers and grabs hold of the dead woman's foot for
text: support as he steps on the remote control, flipping the TV
dialog: on to the Nudie channel, just as...
text: Man opens the door.
text: Man stands at the door, drunk Wife unconscious on one arm,
text: the door knob in the other hand. He's looking mean.
text: Man's POV: focused on the dead woman in the bedsprings. We
text: pan up the dead woman's leg to find Ted holding her foot. We
text: pan down Ted's leg to find the hypodermic needle jutting
text: out... then pan over to the other hand holding the broken
text: syringe plunger.
text: We pan over to the Nudie channel, then down to the fire
text: blazing behind the children. Pan up to the dripping champagne
text: bottle in Sarah's hand, then over to the cigarette hanging
text: out of Juancho's mouth. Juancho tosses his cigarette out of
text: his mouth to an area behind him. Another blaze starts
dialog: immediately.
text: Man drops his Wife to the floor.
text: In the WIDE SHOT of Ted and the children, we see that the
text: fireworks are bursting big and bright outside the window
text: behind them. Almost as bright as the flames eating through
dialog: the room.
text: Man simply glares at Ted. Finally Man speaks...
speaker_heading: MAN

dialog: emergency.
speaker_heading: GUINNESS GIRL
dialog: Gotcha, Betty from work.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Not Betty from work, I'm calling
dialog: Betty! I'm Teddy. Just say Ted.
speaker_heading: GUINNESS GIRL
dialog: Hi, Ted, I'm Margaret. You sound
dialog: down. Has this not been the happiest
dialog: of New Year's?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (resigning himself to
dialog: talking with Margaret)
dialog: No Margaret, this hasn't been my
dialog: best New Year. This year's starting
dialog: off pretty badly.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Awww, how come?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, Betty -- the chick whose house
dialog: you're at, even though you don't
dialog: know her -- leaves me here all by
dialog: myself on New Year's Eve. And first
dialog: thing right off the bat, I'm fucked
text: by a coven of witches.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: An oven full of witches fucked you?
dialog: Is that like at the circus when they
dialog: stick all those clowns in an itty-
dialog: bitty car?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: A coven. A coven of witches. Well,
dialog: one witch in particular.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Was she an old hag with a mole, with
dialog: hair growing out of it?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No-no-no, she was... quite beautiful.
text: Margaret thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What's the problem?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, admittedly, that was the best
dialog: part of the night. It was pretty
dialog: fuckin' cool, actually. But it was
dialog: still an unnerving way to start off
dialog: the night.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Sounds to me like a pretty great way
dialog: to start off the night.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay, let's just skip over the
dialog: witches.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: -- Skipping over the witches.
speaker_heading: TED
text: So, later, in another room, some
text: crazy sucking maniac sticks a gun in
text: my face and forces me to play out
text: some psychosexual drama with his
dialog: wife.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: He made you have psycho sex with his
dialog: wife?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No, he didn't make me fuck his wife,
dialog: he thought I'd fucked his wife! He
text: held me at gunpoint with a loaded
dialog: gun!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What kinda gun?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don't know, I'm not a gun guy. It
dialog: was big.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
text: Like Dirty Harry's gun.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah, something like that.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Did it have a real long barrel or a
dialog: short barrel?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What difference does it make?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Well, for one thing it's the
dialog: difference between a .44 Magnum and
text: a Magnum .357.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Who cares if it was a .44 or a .392,
text: it was a fuckin' loaded gun, pointed
dialog: at my fuckin' head!
text: Margaret takes this in.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You wanna skip over this part, too?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I want you to get Betty on the phone!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: (yelling to the room)
dialog: Anybody live here named...
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: What's her name again?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Betty.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Betty!
text: The sleepy room stirs. Betty wakes up from the floor.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yeah, whatcha screamin' about?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You're Betty?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yeah, I'm Betty, it's my fuckin'
dialog: place, who the fuck are you?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I'm Margaret
dialog: (hands her the phone)
dialog: And this is Ted.
text: Betty takes the phone.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ted, what's the problem?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What's the problem? I don't got a
dialog: problem, I got fuckin' problems!
dialog: Wanna hear?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (yawning, wiping sleep
dialog: from her eyes)
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, most recently, there's room
dialog: 716. There's a scary Mexican gangster
text: dude pokin' his finger in my chest.
dialog: There's his hooligan kids snapping
text: their fingers at me. There's the
text: putrid rotting corpse of a dead whore
text: stuffed in the springs of a bed.
text: There're rooms blazing afire...
dialog: There's a needle from God knows where
text: stuck in my leg, infecting me with
dialog: God knows what, and finally, there's
dialog: me walking out the fuckin' door right
dialog: now! Buenas noches.
text: A RINGING SOUND happens that we haven't heard before. Ted's
text: head turns toward it.
text: It's the guest board. And the top light, the penthouse, is
text: ringing. It rings where all the others buzzed.
text: Betty can hear it distinctly on her side of the line. The
text: sound fully wakes her up. They start talking Howard Hawks
dialog: style again.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (suddenly alert)
dialog: Is that the penthouse?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: That's the Chester Rush party, they
dialog: want something.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah, well, tough titty. They're
dialog: just gonna have to wait, 'cause I'm
text: out the door.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (panicking)
dialog: Now, Ted, wait a minute. I know you're
dialog: freaked, I know you're stressed.
dialog: You've had a real bad night --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes, Betty, I've had-a-real-bad-night --
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: -- You say there's a dead body in a
dialog: room?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes, I did.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No problem, this is a hotel, we've
dialog: had dead bodies before, it's just
dialog: the price of doing business. You
dialog: said the hotel was on fire. Is it
dialog: still on fire?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No, it's out.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Good, sprinkler system worked like a
dialog: charm. Now, you wanna leave, you've
dialog: had enough. Perfectly understandable.
dialog: I'll take care of everything else.
dialog: The only thing I ask is that you
dialog: take care of Chester Rush. Then you
dialog: can leave.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Now, look --
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ted, he's a very important guest of
dialog: this hotel. In fact, he is the most
text: important guest at the hotel. The
dialog: Mon Signor used to be a haven for
dialog: movie stars. Through the thirties
dialog: and forties, and the first half of
dialog: the fifties, more movie stars -- if
dialog: you break it down on a night-by-night
dialog: basis -- stayed at the Mon Signor
dialog: than any other hotel in Hollywood.
dialog: Now, we had some hard time in the
dialog: eighties, even though we were the
dialog: official hotel of Cannon Pictures,
dialog: but we're coming back strong in the
dialog: nineties. And a movie star clientele
dialog: is important to that comeback. If we
dialog: can keep stars of his magnitude happy,
dialog: we're on our way. So, Ted, just take
dialog: care of him, then you can leave.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look, I don't feel like --
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: He probably just wants some champagne!
dialog: You can do that, can't you? Please
dialog: just take care of him, the entire
dialog: staff of the Mon Signor is begging
dialog: you!
text: Ted crumbles.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay. But get your ass here pronto.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You're a good man, Ted. Thanks.
text: Ted hangs up the phone. And picks up the board phone.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hello, Mr. Rush. Sorry for the delay.
dialog: How can I help you?

scene_heading: STORY TITLE CARD:
speaker_heading: THE PENTHOUSE
text: "THE MAN FROM HOLLYWOOD"
scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY TO PENTHOUSE--NIGHT
text: The elevator door opens and Ted wheels out his tray into the
dialog: hallway.
dialog: There's been a bit of an effort to make himself appear a bit
text: less disheveled than in the last scene. He's only minorly
text: successful in the attempt. His uniform still looks like shit,
text: his hair looks tousled, and he walks with a limp.
text: He wheels the cart up to the penthouse door and KNOCKS at
text: the door.
text: A woman opens the door, it's Angela from Alex's story.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Hi, Theodore.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
text: She holds up the drink she has in her hand.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
text: Having a drink.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Is that crazy husband of yours in
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Are you kidding, he'll be asleep
dialog: till Christmas.
text: From behind her we hear:
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Entrez, entrez.
text: Angela steps aside and Ted wheels in the tray.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE--NIGHT
text: The penthouse is huge, far and away the best suite in the
text: house. And standing in the middle of the biggest room in the
text: hotel is the hottest, newest comedy star to burst onto the
dialog: Hollywood scene in nearly a decade: Chester Rush. At this
text: moment in time, he's the king, and he has the swagger of a
text: new king. After only one movie, he's pulled the sword out of
text: the stone. And the look on his face says, "King's good."
text: Surrounding him is his entourage. They all look like once
dialog: upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp; however,
text: at this late hour, everybody looks about as disheveled as
dialog: Ted.
text: One of the lads, Norman, has planted roots in a comfy chair
text: with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of Jim Beam in
text: his hand.
text: The second guy, Leo, is in the back of the room pacing back
text: and forth on the telephone. He is completely oblivious to
text: the rest of the room's activity.
text: In Chester's hand is an ever present glass of champagne,
text: which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly. Around the
text: room are the leftovers: pizza boxes, fast-food hamburgers,
text: and empty bottles of Cristal Champagne.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: (still sitting)
dialog: Entrez, entrez, come in, come in.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (wheeling in the tray)
dialog: Hi, sorry I took so long, but I got
dialog: everything you asked for --
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: -- Not a problem, my friend Mr.
dialog: Bellboy.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (closing the door)
dialog: His name's Theodore.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Actually, it's not Theodore,
text: (he throws a look at
dialog: Angela)
dialog: It's Ted.
text: Chester rises from the couch.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: So, Ted the Bellboy, as I was saying --
dialog: would you care for some champagne?
dialog: That's not what I was saying, but
dialog: would you care for some champagne?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No, thank you.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Ya sure? Cristal. It's the best. I
dialog: never liked champagne before I had
dialog: Cristal, now I love it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay, yeah, sure.
text: As Chester goes and pours Ted a glass:
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: -- As I was saying, Ted, don't worry
dialog: about being late. For our purposes,
text: promptness is far behind thoroughness.
text: On "thoroughness," he hands Ted the glass.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Chin-chin.
text: They clink glasses and drink.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Whadya say, Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Thank you?
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: No, not thank you. Whadya say about
dialog: the tasty beverage?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's good.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Fuckin' good, Ted. It's fuckin' good.
dialog: Let's try it again, shall we? So,
dialog: Ted, whadya think about the beverage.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's fuckin' good.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: You bet your sweet bippy, Ted. It's
dialog: fuckin' Cristal, everything else is
dialog: piss.
text: Norman in the chair starts yelling at Ted.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Bellboy! Bellboy! Bellboy!
text: Ted knows he's being laughed at, but not why.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: (to Norman)
dialog: Knock it off, you're making my friend
dialog: Ted here uneasy.
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: Pay no attention to Norman here,
dialog: Ted, he's just fuckin' wit' ya, that's
dialog: all. That's from Quadrophenia. Now
dialog: me, myself, when I think of bellboys
dialog: I think of -- "bellboy" isn't an
dialog: insult, is it? Is there another name
dialog: for what you do that I'm ignorant
dialog: of? Bellman, bellperson --
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Bellboy's fine.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Good. I'm glad they haven't changed
dialog: that. There's a friendliness to
dialog: "bellboy." As I was saying, Ted,
text: when Norman thinks of bellboys, he
text: thinks of Quadrophenia.
dialog: But me, when I think of bellboys, I think of The Bellboy,
dialog: with Jerry Lewis. Didja ever see The Bellboy?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: You should, it's one of Jerry's better
dialog: movies. He never says a word through
text: the entire film. A completely silent
dialog: performance. How many actors can
dialog: pull that off? And he has to go to
dialog: France to get respect. That says it
dialog: all about America right there. The
dialog: minute Jerry Lewis dies, every paper
dialog: in this fuckin' country gonna write
dialog: articles calling the man a genius.
dialog: It's not right. It's not right and
dialog: it's not fair. But why should that
dialog: surprise anybody? When has America
dialog: ever been fair? We might be right
dialog: every once in a while, but we're
dialog: very rarely fair.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Where do you want this?
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: You in a hurry, Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (he is, but doesn't
dialog: want to rush the
dialog: movie star)
dialog: No, not particularly.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Good, then stop playing "Beat the
dialog: Clock." Now let me introduce you to
dialog: everybody.
text: He puts his arm around Ted and leads him around the room.
text: Angela crosses frame, drink in hand.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Our friend from downstairs you already
text: seem to be acquainted with.
text: As she snuggles up in a big comfy chair:
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Oh, me and Theodore go way back.
dialog: Don't we, Theodore?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The name's Ted, Angela. I only let
text: people with loaded guns at my head
dialog: call me Theodore.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Angela's like you, Ted, a newfound
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: We met at the pool.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: Have you ever seen Angela in a one-
dialog: piece?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Well, it's somethin' to see.
dialog: (arm around Ted)
text: The Man sitting in the chair, with
text: the bottle of Jim Bean in his hand
text: and the sense of humor, is Norman.
dialog: Norman, say hello to Ted.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What's up?
text: Norman shakes his hand.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: The sociable son of a bitch on the
dialog: telephone is Leo. And the person on
text: the other end of the phone is his
dialog: lovely wife Ellen.
dialog: (to Leo)
dialog: Leo, say hello to Ted.
text: Leo breaks away from his phone conversation for two seconds.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Hi, Ted, glad you could make it.
dialog: (back to phone)
dialog: What?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What does punctuality have to do
dialog: with love?
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Which brings me to me, Chester Rush,
dialog: Ted. Pleased to meetcha.
text: Chester shakes Ted's hand.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I know. I'm sorry I haven't seen
dialog: your movie.
text: Chester stops.
text: Ted wonders if he should have said that.
text: Chester walks over to the table and pours himself some more
text: champagne. When he talks now it's slower and somewhat
text: distracted. The tone of the scene starts changing.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: It's quite all right, Ted, nothing
dialog: to feel sorry about. That's why God
dialog: invented video. But you know, Ted, a
dialog: lot of people did see it.
text: Chester takes a drink of champagne, a disgusted look crosses
text: his face, and he slowly puts it down.
text: His manner gives the room a chill.
text: When he talks, he addresses the room.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Who drank out of this bottle last?
dialog: No answer.
text: Chester walks over to Ted and fills his glass.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Who drank out of this bottle -- not
dialog: the other bottles -- this bottle
dialog: last?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What's wrong, Chester?
text: He spills the champagne from his glass onto the floor.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: It's fuckin' flat, Norman, that's
dialog: what's wrong. The champagne -- the
dialog: fuckin' Cristal's fuckin' flat.
text: Chester improvises a temper tantrum about the flat Cristal.
text: Everyone looks at him, not knowing what to say. Even Leo
text: walks over to witness. The whole room is uneasy and a little
dialog: frightened.
text: When Chester finishes his tantrum, he turns his attention
text: back to Ted. As he talks to him, he opens up another bottle.
text: But it's not the rapid-pace delivery Chester has done so
text: far. It's more troubled and distracted.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: I was saying, Ted, a lot of people
dialog: did see it. And not just on video,
dialog: either. Leo, what was the final take
dialog: on domestic?
text: Leo is still in the doorway making sure his boy's cool.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: 72.1 million.
dialog: (worried tone)
dialog: You okay, champ?
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: (struggling with bottle)
dialog: I'm cool, so talk to your wife.
text: Leo turns his attention back to the phone and goes inside
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: 72.1 million dollars. That's before
dialog: video and before foreign, and before
dialog: pay-TV and before free TV. We're
dialog: talking fuckin' asses in fuckin'
dialog: seats.
dialog: (he pops the cork)
dialog: Before all that other shit, The Wacky
dialog: Detective made 72.1 million dollars.
text: Chester walks over to Ted and fills his glass.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: And my new one, The Dog Catcher,
dialog: it's projected to break a hundred.
text: (he clinks Ted's glass
dialog: with his)
dialog: The Dog Catcher.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The Dog Catcher.
text: They both drink.
text: The tantrum's over, and Chester's back to his fast-talking,
dialog: good-natured self.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Now let's stroll over here and see
dialog: what goodies you brought us.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Do you mind me asking what's all
dialog: this stuff for?
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: One thing at a time, Ted. I'm not a
dialog: frog and you're not a bunny, so let's
dialog: not jump ahead. C'mon, Norman, you
dialog: should be interested in this.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Damn Skippy!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Tell it.
dialog: Ted produces the things they called for.
speaker_heading: TED
text: A block of wood.
text: Chester knocks on it.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: TED
text: Three nails.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Why three nails?
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: That's how many Peter Lorre asked
dialog: for. Continue, Ted.
text: Ted is completely bewildered.
speaker_heading: TED
text: A roll of twine.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: That's definitely a roll of twine.
dialog: Continue.
speaker_heading: TED
text: A bucket of ice.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: (to Norman)
dialog: You into it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (to Chester)
dialog: I'm into it.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: TED
text: A donut.
text: Chester takes it and eats it.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: That's for me. Continue.
speaker_heading: TED
text: And a hatchet.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
text: A hatchet as sharp as the devil
dialog: himself is what I asked for.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, you be the judge.
text: Ted holds the hatchet out for Chester to take. Norman snatches
dialog: it instead.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'll be the judge.
text: Norman touches the end of the blade with his thumb.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Whadya think?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That's a sharp motherfucker. Bring
dialog: all this bullshit over to the bar.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: You heard him, Ted.
text: Ted is completely confused and starting to get a little
text: scared, but he does what he's told.
text: Leo slams down the phone.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Bitch!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You still married?
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Maybe, maybe not, but I don't give a
dialog: flyin' fuck either way. I've had it
dialog: with that Machiavellian bitch! I'm
dialog: too drunk to drive home. I'm sorry
dialog: about that, I'm real sorry about
dialog: that. I got drunk on New Year's Eve,
dialog: cut my fuckin' head off...
dialog: (noticing Ted at the
dialog: bar)
dialog: What's going on here?
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: We now return you to The Man from
text: Rio, already in progress.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Noooo, you're gonna do it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Looks like.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: You guys ain't bullshittin', you're
dialog: gonna really go for it?
text: Angela is still curled up.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: After talkin' about it all night,
dialog: they better. I wanna see a show.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: When we do it, you'll have something
dialog: to see.
text: Leo walks up to Norman and throws his arm around him.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: You are one radical dude.
dialog: Ted doesn't know what anybody's talking about, which is just
text: fine with him. He finishes laying out everything on the bar
dialog: and says:
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, that's everything, so if you
dialog: don't need me for anything else,
dialog: I'll go back downstairs.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Not so fast, Ted. We ain't quite
dialog: done yet. Why don't you take a seat
dialog: at the bar, get comfortable, and
dialog: have an open mind when we explain
dialog: the festivities of the evening to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look, guys, you paid for the room.
dialog: As long as you don't break up the
dialog: furniture, you can do whatever the
dialog: fuck you want. And me personally, I
dialog: don't care if you break up the
dialog: furniture. You don't have to explain
dialog: anything to me. Whatever constitutes
dialog: a good time as far as you guys are
dialog: concerned is your business.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Well, it's your business, Ted. 'Cause
dialog: we want you to take part.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Take part in what?
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Chester, your way of breaking the
text: news to him gently is scarin' the
dialog: shit outta him.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Look at the poor guy. Just spit it
dialog: out.
text: Little by little everybody has gathered around Ted.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: First off, let me say that there's
dialog: nothing homosexual about what we're
dialog: going to ask you to do. There's
dialog: nothing sexual at all about what we
dialog: want. But I was thinkin' you might
dialog: be thinkin' we want you to do some
dialog: sex thing. Pee on us, suck us off,
dialog: shit like that. Let me assure you
dialog: nothing could be farther from what
dialog: we want --
text: Angela interrupts:
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Can I jump in here?
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: No, you can't jump in here, this is
dialog: my story.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Theodore's been here fifteen minutes
dialog: and you've talked about everything
dialog: but.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Hey, if you don't like it, you can
dialog: get the fuck out.
text: Leo taps his champagne glass with a tiny spoon, shutting
dialog: everybody up.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: If it'll please the court, let me
dialog: explain to Ted our intentions.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: I second the nomination!
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Move the nomination be closed!
text: Chester takes the hatchet and brings it down on the bar like
text: a hatchet.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Leo, the floor is yours.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: Ted, did you ever watch the old
dialog: "Alfred Hitchcock Show"?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (totally bewildered
dialog: at this point)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Did you ever see the episode The Man
dialog: from Rio, with Peter Lorre and Steve
dialog: McQueen?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Oh, you'd remember it all right. In
text: the show, Peter Lorre makes a bet
dialog: that Steve McQueen can't light his
text: cigarette lighter ten times in a
dialog: row. Now if Steve McQueen can light
text: his cigarette lighter ten times in a
text: row, he wins Peter Lorre's new car.
dialog: If he can't he loses his little
dialog: finger.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Norman and Chester just made the
dialog: same bet.
dialog: (pause)
text: Norman's putting up his pinky against
dialog: Chester's mint convertible, 1964 red
dialog: convertible Chevy Corvelle that he
text: can light his Zippo ten times in a
dialog: row.
dialog: Pause.
text: Ted looks at all of them, taking in the information, before
dialog: saying:
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You guys are drunk.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Well, that goes without saying, but
dialog: that doesn't mean we don't know what
dialog: we're doing.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'll tell ya what I'm doin'.
text: Norman lays an issue of Hot Classic Cars in front of Ted on
text: the bar. On the cover is a picture of Chester smiling,
text: standing next to a beautiful 1964 red convertible Chevy
text: Corvelle. The headline reads: "Hollywood's Hottest New Star
dialog: Next to America's Hottest Old Car."
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I drive a motherfuckin' Honda my
dialog: sister sold me. You hear what I'm
dialog: sayin'? A little white motherfuckin'
dialog: Honda Civic.
text: (he holds up the
dialog: magazine)
dialog: You see this shit?!
dialog: (reading the magazine)
dialog: "Hollywood's hottest new star, next
dialog: to America's hottest old car."
dialog: (he hands Ted the
dialog: magazine)
dialog: Now you take a good look at that
dialog: machine that this motherfucker over
dialog: here is standing next to. That's a
text: 1964 nigger-red, rag-top Chevy
dialog: Corvelle. And I love that car more'n
dialog: I love hips, lips, and fingertips.
dialog: Cut to we sittin' here celebrating,
dialog: gettin' high, drinkin' champagne --
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: -- Cristal. When you're drinkin'
dialog: anything else, you're drinking
dialog: champagne. When you're drinkin'
dialog: Cristal, you say you're drinkin'
dialog: Cristal.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: -- drinkin' Cristal. Watchin' TV.
dialog: "Rockin' New Year's Eve." When all
text: of a sudden we flip on Steve McQueen
dialog: and Peter Lorre bein' fuckin' badass.
dialog: And I look at this funny motherfucker
dialog: over here, and I say, "I'd do that
dialog: for the Chevelle."
speaker_heading: LEO
text: And Chester replies...
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: "...Oh, really?"
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You guys wouldn't be doin' something
dialog: this stupid unless you were drunk.
text: Everybody breaks into a "here, here" murmur.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I think that pretty much goes without
dialog: sayin'. We'd probably chicken out.
dialog: But when you're fucked-up, you don't
dialog: lie. You tell the fuckin' truth. And
dialog: the fuckin' truth is, my lucky Zippo's
dialog: gonna win me Chester's car.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (to Chester)
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Thrill of the bet. I'm the one with
dialog: something to lose here. 'Cause I can
dialog: pretty near guarantee that I love my
dialog: car more'n Norman loves his pinky.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (to Leo)
dialog: How 'bout you guys, you're just gonna
dialog: sit back and let your friends mutilate
dialog: each other?
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Why not? Life don't get much more
dialog: exciting than this. I mean if Norman
dialog: was puttin' his dick on the choppin'
dialog: block, I'd step in, 'cause, ya know
dialog: in the morning, we'd really regret
dialog: that. But his pinky? Who gives a
dialog: fuck? I mean theoretically, he could
dialog: lose that choppin' onions tomorrow.
text: Life still goes on.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (to Angela)
dialog: How 'bout you?
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Which brings us to your part in this
dialog: little wager.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don't have a part.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Now, Ted, my old granddaddy used ta
dialog: say: "The less a man makes declarative
dialog: statements, the less he's apt to
dialog: look foolish in retrospect." Now
dialog: there're some inherent obstacles in
dialog: this undertaking. First of all, I'm
dialog: not some sick fuck like Peter Lorre
dialog: on that show, travelin' the
dialog: countryside collecting fingers. We're
dialog: all buddies, here. Nobody wants Norman
dialog: to lose his finger. We just wanna
text: chop it off. So if fate doesn't smile
dialog: on ol' Norman, we'll put his finger
text: on ice and rush 'im to a hospital,
dialog: where in all likelihood be able to
dialog: sew it back on.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hopefully.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Eighty percent.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Our side.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: So Norman's protected. His interests
dialog: have been looked after. My interests,
dialog: on the other hand, have not. I am as
dialog: emotionally attached to my car as
text: Norman is physically to his finger.
dialog: I'm putting up a very expensive piece
dialog: of machinery on this wager. Now, if
dialog: I lose, I lose, I have no problem
dialog: with that. I'm a big boy, I knew
dialog: what I was doing. However, if I win,
dialog: I wanna win. If Norman lights his
dialog: lighter ten times in a row, he's
dialog: gonna have no emotional problems
dialog: about taking my car keys whatsoever.
dialog: But if I win, it's not inconceivable
dialog: that Leo or myself, at the last
dialog: minute, might not be able to wield
dialog: the ax. Which brings us full circle
dialog: to you, Ted. Sober Ted. Clear-eyed
dialog: Ted. We want you to be the diceman.
text: Pause as they all look at him. Angela breaks it.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Helluva night, huh, Ted?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I gotta get out of here.
text: Ted abruptly gets up and makes a beeline for the door.
text: Chester whips out a hundred-dollar bill and quickly calls to
text: Ted from his position at the bar.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Ted, I got a hundred-dollar bill
dialog: here with your name on it, whether
dialog: you do what we ask or not, just to
text: sit back down in the chair for one
dialog: minute more.
text: Ted spins in his direction.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm not gonna cut off his finger!
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Maybe you will and maybe you won't,
dialog: but that has nothing to do with this
dialog: hundred-dollar bill in my hand. You
dialog: can tell us all to go fuck off and
dialog: walk right out that door. But if you
dialog: sit back down and wait sixty seconds
dialog: before you do it, you'll be a hundred
dialog: dollars richer.
text: Ted just stands across the room, thinking.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Ted. Take the money.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Ted, you're gonna do whatever you
dialog: want to do. We're just askin' you to
dialog: indulge us for another minute more.
dialog: And Chester's willin' to pay for it.
dialog: Ted thinks.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'll take your money, and I'll sit
dialog: back down. But a minute from now,
dialog: I'm gonna walk out the door, and
dialog: when I do, there'll be no hard
dialog: feelings?
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Well, I want you to have a bit more
dialog: of an open mind than that, but, yeah,
dialog: we'll either convince you or we won't.
dialog: No hard feelings. Right, guys?
dialog: Everybody agrees.
text: Ted wearily sits back down.
text: Chester positions himself in front of Ted at the bar.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Okay, Leo, you be the timekeeper.
dialog: Let us know when one minute begins
dialog: and when it ends.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: You got it.
dialog: (he checks his watch)
dialog: Gentlemen, start your engines.
text: Chester jumps up and down, loosening up.
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Begin!
text: Chester, who talks fast anyway, starts his pitch. It's Chester
text: who now plays "Beat the Clock."
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Okay, pay attention here, Ted, I
dialog: ain't got much time. Now I'm gonna
dialog: make two piles here on the bar.
dialog: (he takes the hundred-
dialog: dollar bill and lays
dialog: it out on the bar)
dialog: One pile,
dialog: (pointing at the
dialog: hundred-dollar bill)
dialog: which is yours. And another pile,
dialog: (Chester whips out a
dialog: money roll fat enough
dialog: to choke a horse to
dialog: death)
dialog: which could be yours.
dialog: (he lays a matching
dialog: hundred-dollar bill
text: on the bar, starting
dialog: a second pile)
dialog: Now, what you have to be aware of is
dialog: we're gonna do this bet, one way,
dialog: (he lays another
dialog: hundred on the end
dialog: pile)
dialog: or the other.
dialog: (he lays another
dialog: hundred on the pile)
dialog: Whether it's you who holds the ax,
dialog: (he lays another
dialog: hundred on the pile)
text: or the desk clerk downstairs,
dialog: (he lays another
dialog: hundred on the pile)
text: or some bum we yank off the street.
dialog: (he lays another
dialog: hundred on the pile)
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You can buy a lot of soup with that
dialog: pile.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: (to Norman)
dialog: Shhhh, I'm the closer.
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: How much is on the bar already? I
dialog: lost count.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
text: Six hundred.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Six hundred. Ted, do you know how
dialog: long it takes the average American
dialog: to count to six hundred?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: (laying another bill
dialog: on the pile)
text: One minute less than it takes to
dialog: count to seven hundred. You know,
text: Ted, a person's life is made up of a
dialog: zillion little experiences.
dialog: (he lays another bill
dialog: on the pile)
dialog: Some, which have no meaning, are
dialog: insignificant and you forget them.
dialog: And some that stick with you for the
dialog: rest of your natural life --
dialog: (he lays another bill
dialog: on the pile)
dialog: -- barring Alzheimer's of course.
dialog: Now, what we're proposing is so
dialog: unusual, so outside the norm, that I
dialog: think it would be a pretty good guess
dialog: that this will be one of those
dialog: experiences that sticks. So, since
dialog: you're gonna be stuck remembering
dialog: this moment for the rest of your
dialog: life, you gotta decide what that
dialog: memory will be.
dialog: (He lays down the
dialog: last bill on the
dialog: pile)
dialog: So, are you gonna remember for the
dialog: next forty years, give or take a
dialog: decade, how you refused a thousand
dialog: dollars for one second's worth of
dialog: work, or how you made a thousand
dialog: dollars for one second's worth of
dialog: work?
speaker_heading: LEO
dialog: Time!
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Well, Ted, what's it gonna be?
text: Ted looks at the pile, then looks up. We dolly into his face.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK
text: We see a quick MONTAGE of horrendous moments from all the
dialog: other stories.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE--NIGHT
dialog: Back to Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Okay.
text: The group cheers.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But when it's over, no matter what
dialog: happens, I get the money?
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: As long as you do your part, you can
dialog: take the pile, walk out the door,
dialog: and not say another word.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Let's do it right now, before I change
dialog: my mind.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Here, here.
text: Everybody gets in their position by the bar. Norman lays his
text: left hand on the block of wood with his pinky sticking out.
text: In his right hand is his Zippo lighter, poised and ready to
dialog: strike.
text: Chester hands Ted the meat cleaver.
text: Ted takes it, raises it up above Norman's finger, in position.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect!
dialog: This is great! This is a moment in
dialog: time none of us will ever forget.
text: Everybody is crowded around the scene, on pins and needles.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Norman, you ready?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Ready!
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Ted, you ready?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ready.
speaker_heading: CHESTER
dialog: Okeydoke. Norman, begin.
text: Norman looks hard at the Zippo in his hand. Ted, holding the
text: cleaver, stares focused on Norman's pinky.
text: Norman readies himself.
text: Places his thumb on the wheel in the Zippo.
text: Takes a breath.
dialog: And strikes.
text: It sparks, but doesn't light.
text: Without missing a beat, Ted brings down the cleaver, slicing
text: off Norman's pinky.
text: Norman lets out a scream.
text: Ted, in one move, lays down the cleaver, scoops up the money
text: and walks out the door.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY--AFTER DAWN
text: CAMERA is positioned at far end of hallway, looking down it
text: at the elevator at the other end.
text: Ted walks out of the penthouse in the f.g. In a MEDIUM SHOT,
text: he takes the thousand dollars in his hand, looks at it,
text: smiles, and sticks it in his pocket. It might've been a bad
text: night, but it's been a profitable one. He chuckles at the
text: irony, and, whistling a happy tune, turns his back on the
text: camera and walks down the hall to the elevator.
text: All the while we hear PANDEMONIUM breaking out behind the
dialog: door.
text: As Ted walks to the elevator, the CREDITS ROLL. He waits for
text: the elevator, it arrives, he gets in, the doors close.
text: As CREDITS CONTINUE TO ROLL, we hold for about two beats...
dialog: then...
text: The door BURSTS open and everybody comes piling out.
text: Everybody's screaming, yelling different things to one
text: another. Norman has a bloody towel wrapped around his hand,
text: he's screaming and crying.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: My finger, my fucking finger!!
text: Chester has the bucket of ice with the finger in it. Leo's
text: trying to direct everything. Everybody's in frantic activity,
text: except for Angela, who stands back, drinks her drink, and
text: watches the show. They all run down the hall, toward the
text: elevator. Somebody trips and they all hit the ground. The
text: bucket of ice with the finger goes spilling. They run around
text: like crazy, looking for the finger and picking up ice cubes.
text: Norman lies on the floor and screams. They pick it all up,
text: get to the elevator, and push the button.
text: When it arrives, they all dive in except for Angela.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: You know, I'm gonna call it a night
dialog: and go back to my room. It's been
dialog: fun.
text: The doors close on the screaming maniacs.
text: Angela walks through a door marked "Stairway."
scene_heading: INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY--AFTER DAWN
scene_heading: MEDIUM STAIRWAY DOOR
text: CREDIT ROLL continues Angela comes through the door; we
text: STEADICAM in front of her as she walks the halls, looking
text: for her room. She finds it...
scene_heading: WE STOP CREDITS
speaker_heading: FOUR ROOMS
text: Angela sticks her key in the door, then stops when she sees
text: something approaching. The look on her face combines strange
text: awe and mild shock.
text: Almost floating ethereally, a mysterious Blond Bombshell,
text: wearing Diana's see-through negligee and slippers, armed
text: with Elspeth's sword slung over her shoulder, wanders toward
text: her. She is in a daze, perhaps lost or drunk.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: You okay, lady?
text: The bombshell looks up at her dizzily.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: I said -- you looking for someone?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (disoriented)
dialog: Uhhh... yes... my husband... I think.
dialog: Have you seen him?
text: Angela and the girl have a strange moment as they connect
text: through the eyes.
text: Having had enough emotional intensity tonight, Angela breaks
text: their eye contact.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Lady, I haven't seen anybody.
text: Diana quietly says, "Ohhh," as she drifts on down the hall
text: in a daze. Angela puts her hand to her temples before opening
text: her hotel door. She does a double-take on the hallway --
text: empty.
text: She pauses a beat, then walks into her room. After the door
text: closes, we hear Sigfried on the other side.
speaker_heading: SIGFRIED
dialog: Where the hell have you been?
text: CREDITS CONTINUE TO ROLL
speaker_heading: THE END
