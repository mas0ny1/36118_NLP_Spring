scene_heading: EXT. PARLIAMENT HILL, NORTH LONDON - DAY (SEPTEMBER)

dialog: secrets.
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY

dialog: diaries dating back to the 1950’s.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: You. Only you.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCHWAY ROAD - EARLY MORNING
text: The roar of traffic. The urban ravine of the Archway Road.
text: The red, black and gold cast-iron ‘suicide bridge’ which
text: straddles it.
text: Barbara driving to work in her old W Polo.
scene_heading: EXT. ST GEORGE’S SCHOOL/CAR PARK —- MORNING
text: The school is a bleak, Victorian building with various modern
dialog: add-ons.
text: Barbara locks her car and heads for the main entrance.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM —- MINUTES LATER
text: Barbara takes out her lesson planner, text books, registrar.
text: She organizes them neatly on her desk.
text: Barbara stares at the rows of empty desks and chairs.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: The first day of a new term.
text: Sound of PUPILS arriving outside. Barbara observes them from
dialog: her high window.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - DAY
text: Kids in school uniform stream through the gates.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: Here come the local pubescent proles.
text: They play football, gossip, fight and skirmish. A diverse
dialog: ethnic mix, about fifty percent white.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: The future shop assistants and plumbers. And
dialog: doubtless the odd terrorist too.
text: A teacher (BRIAN) oversees the general activity.
text: SHEBA HART comes in through the main gates pushing her tatty,
text: old bicycle. She looks a little lost.
text: Brian directs her to the bike racks.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. RECEPTION AREA/MAIN COURTYARD - LATER
text: Barbara watches TED MAWSON (Deputy Head) outside with Sheba,
text: he’s introducing her to MEMBERS OF STAFF passing by.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: In the old days we confiscated cigarettes and
text: ‘wank mags’. Now it’s knives and crack
dialog: cocaine. And they call it progress.
text: The school bell rings and Sheba is whisked away in another
dialog: direction.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY
text: Barbara writes ‘Wittenberg’ on the board. Other stray phrases
dialog: already there: ‘Diet of worms’ ‘Martin Luther’.
text: She’s teaching ‘The Reformation’ to a class of bored 16 year
dialog: olds.
text: The bell rings. The kids immediately snatch up their hooks to
text: leave. Barbara makes a gesture - they sit back down.
speaker_heading: RID
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Fuckin’ poison granny.
text: Barbara surveys her class. Another gesture: ‘you may go’.
scene_heading: INT. SPORTS HALL - AFTER-NOON (A WEEK LATER)
text: A committee meeting of around TWENTY TEACHERS chaired by the
text: Headmaster, SANDY PABBLEM.
text: His secretary (GITA) takes notes. The staff sit in chairs in
text: a circle, Barbara amongst them. In passing we see teachers
scene_heading: ELAINE CLIFFORD and SUE HODGE.
speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: Before we start, can those of you who haven’t
dialog: delivered your reports please lob ‘em in my
dialog: general direction.
text: He goes round the circle. Staff hand him their school issue
text: report files, all thick with their work.
speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: Thanks Bill, Elaine. Thank you, Linda - how’s
dialog: Greg?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: A bit better, thanks.
text: He holds his hands together - a gesture of emotional
dialog: solidarity.
speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: Good, good.
text: Sheba comes in mouthing apologies for her lateness.
speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: Ah! Has everyone met our new Art teacher,
dialog: Sheba Hart?
text: General murmars of ‘hello’ and ‘welcome’.
speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: I’ve invited Sheba to sit in on this meeting.
dialog: As you know, I regard The Arts as absolutely
dialog: central to our policy of ‘reform through
dialog: nurture.’
text: Barbara gestures to the empty chair beside her. But another
text: teacher (BILL RUMER) is comically commanding Sheba to sit
text: next to him. Which she does.
speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: Welcome to you.
text: Sheba takes out a note-pad and pen, looking nervous but keen.
text: Pabblem continues collecting the reports.
speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: Thank you, Sue. Ooh, that’s a big one! I’1ll be
dialog: up ‘til the crack of dawn. Anyone else not
dialog: handed in their homework?
text: He turns to Barbara, a hint of nervousness.
speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: Barbara...?
text: Barbara coolly produces her file. It’s impossibly thin.
text: Pabblem pretends to weigh it on his hand go that others can
dialog: witness its paucity.
text: Encouraged by polite laughter he opens it to reveal a single
text: sheet of typed paper.
speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: This is your report? On the History
dialog: Department? On its entire workings? And your
dialog: general thoughts for its future development?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You’ll find it’s quite thorough, Headmaster.
text: The teachers look tense but one or two are secretly amused —
text: this is vintage Barbara. Gita looks appalled.
text: Pabblem stares at the report; it’s one paragraph long.
speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: (reads aloud)
dialog: ‘The History Department functions much as one
dialog: would expect for a school of this stature and
dialog: intake. Examination results have been
dialog: consistent for thirty years; below the
dialog: national average but above the level of
dialog: catastrophe. Recommendation: no change
dialog: necessary’.
text: Barbara looks innocent, defying Pabblem to explode-
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It took me most of the summer to write it.
text: He stares at her in impotent fury.
text: Barbara sneaks a look at Sheba.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: Hard to read the wispy novice. Is she a sphinx
dialog: or simply stupid?
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND - LUNCH—TIME (A WEEK LATER)
text: Sheba on playground duty, wrapped in a coat, she’s patrolling
text: amongst the children. Barbara lurks nearby.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
text: Artfully dishevelled today. The tweedy tramp
dialog: coat is an abhorrence. It seems to say, ‘I’m
dialog: just like you’. But clearly she is not.
text: Sheba intervenes between two kids sparring for a fight.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: A fey person, I suspect. Fey.
text: suddenly - a roar from some BOYS playing football. The goal
text: scorer, a BOY of fifteen, celebrates by whipping his shirt
text: off and waving it in jubilation - naked from the waist up.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Put your shirt on!
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: I got the winner, Miss!
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Glory be. Shirt.
text: Barbara glances at Sheba. She seems to be looking straight at
text: her. Barbara wonders if Sheba disapproves her ticking off the
text: boy. As he runs away:
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Good goal!
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CANTEEN - DAY
text: Barbara with her tray cating lunch.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: She has certainly rippled the waters of our
text: stagnant pond. They flock to her.
text: She watches Brian approaching Sheba.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0O.)
dialog: Even limp, little Brian had a go. Oh, the ‘
dialog: horror.
text: Other TEACHERS, almost queuing for Sheba’s attention. :
scene_heading: INT/EXT. CANTEEN/COURTYARD - ANOTHER DAY
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
text: And Fatty Hodge has pounced on her.
text: Barbara at a grubby canteen table - watching with a seemingly
text: benign smile.
text: Sheba and SUE HODGE are on a bench outside, bathed in
text: sunlight as they eat their sandwiches.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
text: A dubious double-act; the blonde and the pig
dialog: in knickers.
text: Sue chews like a rabbit as Sheba chortles.
scene_heading: INT. STAFF ROOM - A WEEK LATER
text: Barbara on a break. A few other TEACHERS dotted around. Brian
text: comes in looking a little sheepish.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I just went past the Art Studio...
dialog: Barbara glances up-
speaker_heading: BRIAN .
dialog: It’s bloody Lord of the Flies in there.
speaker_heading: ELAINE CLIFFORD
dialog: Have they gone for her?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (nods)
text: Torn her posters down, full on paint fight,
dialog: they're chanting, ‘get your tits out for the
dialog: lads’. Girls too. It’s carnage.
text: Barbara looks concerned, shares a shake of the head with
text: Elaine. Bill looks up from the coffee station.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How was Madam?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Totally lost it.
dialog: (imitates Sheba)
dialog: ‘Stop it! Stop it you little fucking
dialog: bastards.’
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You should’ve stepped in.
text: Brian looks anxious, thinks she’s right.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: He didn’t want to patronize the little lady.
dialog: She’1l be alright. The bourgeoisie need a good
dialog: pasting now and then, reminds ‘em where the
dialog: true power resides.
text: He lobs a tea-bag in his mug.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: This time next year she’ll be Headmistress.
dialog: Antonia - another teacher - explodes:
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Oh Christ, will you shut up?! I’m trying to
dialog: work!
text: She gestures to a mountain of school books she’s marking.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Sorry, sorry. Char, anyone?
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: Babs?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Milk, no sugar.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sweet enough?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Evidently.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Didn't her father invent inflation?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You what?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Wasn’t her dad that academic; Donald whatsit?
dialog: Economics bloke, he invented the word
dialog: ‘inflation’.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (lying)
dialog: Oh yeah, yeah, I know who you mean.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I think you’ll find that Mrs Hart’s father was
dialog: Professor Ronald Taylor. He didn’t ‘invent
dialog: inflation’, he devised a theory about the
dialog: relationship between inflation and consumer
dialog: expectation.
text: A silence. Brian and Elaine share a look at Barbara’s
dialog: expense.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION AREA - A WEEK LATER
text: The school day over. Barbara walks through the lobby. she
text: hears loud noises from the library and goes to look.
text: A photocopied sign on the door: HOMEWORK CLUB.
text: Through the window she sees TWO BOYS fighting and Sheba
text: desperately trying to separate them. OTHER KIDS encourage the
dialog: fighters. It’s mayhem.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Stop this immediately! Stop it both of you or
dialog: you’1l be up before the Head!
dialog: Barbara waits: let Sheba suffer or be her saviour?
text: The chaos continues - she takes a deep breath then bursts in,
dialog: bellowing:
scene_heading: Int. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: BARBARA
speaker_heading: ENOUGH!
text: Immediate silence. She parts the boys with swift and vigorous
text: force. Sheba is hugely relieved but Barbara’s not finished
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (To the boys)
dialog: Outside. Now!
text: The two boys file out. Barbara surveys the rest of the class.
text: A BOY has a baseball cap on. Barbara points to her head, the
text: boy removes the cap from his own.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (To other kids)
dialog: Get on with your work!
text: Which they do, at once. And then Barbara marches out.
text: Sheba is unsure whether she’s supposed to follow. Barbara
text: gestures for her to come with.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LIBRARY — MOMENTS LATER
text: The boys are looking at the floor, hands in pockets.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Why were they fighting, Mrs Hart?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: The motive was unclear.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (To first boy)
dialog: Davis I know - you’re a little thug, aren’t
dialog: you?
dialog: (To second boy)
dialog: And who might you be?
text: The second boy is STEVEN CONNOLLY (15).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: Steven Connolly, Miss.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Steven Connolly, Miss.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Year?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Year Ten, Miss.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (suddenly remembers )
dialog: The naked footballer. Why were you fighting?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s a perfectly simple question.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Dunno, Miss.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You don’t know. One minute you’re an inert
dialog: lump, the next you’re attempting to castrate a
dialog: fellow pupil. Nothing cccurred between these
dialog: two states?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No, Miss.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (cod Irish accent)
dialog: Don’t be a hero, Connolly, it’s hardly da
dialog: place.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yes? Brain - mouth - and speak.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: He was saying stuff about Miss.
dialog: (nods at Sheba)
dialog: He was bang out of order.
dialog: This is news to Sheba.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (To Davis)
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: I never said nothing-
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (correcting him)
dialog: ‘I didn’t say anything’.
dialog: (To Connolly)
dialog: What did he say? Oh, come on!
speaker_heading: CONNOLLY
dialog: He said she’s a tart...he said he gave her one
dialog: up the arse.
text: Sheba is shocked, Barbara is not.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (To Davis)
dialog: Did you indeed? Odious boy, apologize at once.
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: (To Sheba)
dialog: Sorry, Miss.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
text: Deputy Head in the morning. Now back in, both
dialog: of you.
text: The boys shuffle in to the library. Sheba shakes her head.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Little towers of testosterone, you'll get used
dialog: to them.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Thank you so much. I’d better...
text: She gestures to the library but Barbara holds out her hand.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: oh, sorry, we haven’t met properly, have we?
dialog: Sheba Hart. Art department.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Barbara Covett. History.
text: Barbara watches Sheba go back in. And smiles for the first
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
text: Quite a nice voice, plummy and deep. As if her
text: mouth was pure, as if she’d never had a
dialog: filling.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND - ANOTHER DAY
text: Barbara and Sheba on playground duty. They smile at each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0-)
text: The complexion of a white peach. One can
text: almost see her veins.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CANTEEN — ANOTHER DAY
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0O.)
dialog: Her trendy politics are similarly transparent .
text: Barbara, Sheba and Sue in the busy lunch queue.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: We serve them best if we teach them to read,
dialog: write and add. They don’t need to know about
dialog: the basket weavers of Chile.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Barbara’s very keen on the basics.
text: Sheba helps herself to some sad looking coleslaw.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: (To Barbara)
dialog: But when you started, didn’t you want to give
dialog: them a...a real education? To help them
dialog: overcome - well...
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: -.-the poverty of their backgrounds?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Yes of course but one soon learns that
dialog: teaching is crowd control - we’re a branch of
dialog: the social services.
text: Barbara spots a boy stealing a Kit Kat.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (To boy)
dialog: Put it back!
text: Sheba looks mournful, Sue tries to rally her.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Console yourself with the gems. Every now and
dialog: then you find one with an agile mind and a
dialog: will to learn. That’s when it’s satisfying,
dialog: when you can really make a difference.
dialog: Sheba seems to really ‘hear’ this.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
text: The rest is just cattle prod and pray.
text: They carry their trays to a vacant table. Barbara watches
text: Sheba intently, she seems so defeated by it all. But her
dialog: sadness is beautiful to behold...
dialog: [a
dialog: [3
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: I can see why others are beguiled by her.
scene_heading: EXT. ART STUDIO - LATE AFTER-NOON (ANOTHER DAY)
text: Barbara waiting outside.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: But I wonder if she possesses the requisite
dialog: heft?
text: Sheba emerges pulling on her coat, surprised to see Barbara
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Fancy a coffee?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Mmm.
text: They head off. But then Barbara spots SUE emerging from the
text: other side of the playground. She tries to usher Sheba at
text: speed but Sue is gaining on them. A chase!
text: Fatally, Barbara glances back and Sheba follows suit. she
text: sees the panting Sue and waits for her to join them - much to
dialog: Barbara’s frustration.
scene_heading: INT. GREASY CAFF — LATER
text: Barbara smoking - ever so slightly sulking. Sue and Sheba sip
text: cappuccinos. Sue mock taps the table with her spoon.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Ahem. I’ve got a bit of an announcement:
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You’re leaving St George’s?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: oh, you’re pregnant.
text: Sue registers a moment of anti-climactic sadness.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: That’s fantastic! Congratulations! When are
dialog: you due?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: June the seventh.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: A summer baby, how lovely.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: So you'll be taking maternity leave?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Mmm, can’t wait!
text: Barbara nods, encouragingly.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Rest is so important.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Do you know what it is?
text: Sheba catches Barbara’s eye and suggests she put her
text: cigarette out. Barbara does so but only to please her.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Rog reckons it’s a boy but I'm certain it’s a
dialog: girl. Aren’t they supposed to be iow slung? I
dialog: can’t believe nobody noticed, I’m 14 weeks!
dialog: Didn’t you see how chunky I’m getting?!
text: Barbara notices a dab of froth on Sheba’s nose. She hands her
text: a serviette. Sheba thanks her with a smile.
scene_heading: EXT. CHEMIST/STREET - LATER
text: Barbara and Sheba waiting outside. Sue inside buying a hot
dialog: water bottle.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Do you want to come for lunch, on Sunday?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: To mine, to our house.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Won't you be with your family?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Yes but you’re very welcome. It’s no big deal,
dialog: I’1l just do a lasagne or something.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I adore lasagne.
dialog: 
text: Barbara is almost blushing.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - SATURDAY
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: Bliss!
text: Women's wear. A SHOP ASSISTANT nods as Barbara discusses the
text: virtues of a skirt she’s interested in.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: A merry flag on the Arctic wilderness of my
dialog: calendar.
text: Shoe Department. Five different pairs for consideration.
text: To ANOTHER SHOP ASSISTANT’s relief Barbara finally plumps for
text: a pair of black, low heelers with a strap.
scene_heading: INT. HAIRDRESSERS - SAME DAY
text: Barbara seemingly asleep while the GIRL washes her hair.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: One must make an effort when one receives an
dialog: invitation.
text: She half opens one eye and sees the girl making faces. The
text: gixl at the next sink mocks her own customer similarly.
scene_heading: INT. BARBARA’S FLAT - EVENING
text: Barbara walks into the bedroom in her new heels. She twirls
text: in front of the mirror, ‘catching herself’.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: The art of it is seeming not to.
text: Barbara carefully spray starches her white blouse.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. BARBARA’S CAR/STREET - SUNDAY
text: Barbara cruising down the street looking for a space. Her VW
text: Polo incongrucus amongst the smart cars already parked.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: Lasagne tends to disagree with my bowels...
text: She parks and takes out her compact, touches up her make up.
text: She’s early. And nervous.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: T’1l ask for a small portion.
text: She lights a cigarette. Determined to stay calm.
scene_heading: EXT. SHEBA’S HOUSE ~- TEN MINUTES LATER
text: Barbara walks up the front steps of a large Victorian house.
text: She observes the front garden; a cherry tree, a rusty bike, a
text: mildewed cricket bat handle impaled in the unkempt grass.
text: She stands there, pristine in her grey skirt, white blouse,
text: new black heels. She holds a bunch of flowers.
text: She composes herself and presses the bell. No sound.
text: She tries again. Waits. Nothing. She tries the knocker.
text: The door is opened by a tall, slightly shaggy MAN in his late
dialog: fifties.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I think I’ve come to the wrong house.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (smiles) .
dialog: No, you're bang on. I’m Richard. Come in!
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I’m so sorry, I thought—
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: That I’‘d be twenty years younger and twice as
dialog: handsome.
text: He helps her out of her coat.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Sorry, were you out there long? The bell’s
dialog: knackered.
dialog: /lo
text: He dumps her coat over the bannister. The hall is cluttered
dialog: with junk, boots, bicycles etc.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Bash!
text: A flustered Sheba pokes her head out the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Hi, Barbara! The kitchen’s on fire!
text: Richard raises an eyebrow and ushers Barbara:
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM — CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh, what a splendid room.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What can I get you? We’re semi-pro drinkers
dialog: here; absinthe, hooch, pick your poison.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Could I have a dry sherry, please?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Erm...I might have some apricot brandy
dialog: knocking around...
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Or a dry white wine?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Done. Have a seat.
text: Barbara takes in the room; the look is ‘battered bourgeois’ -—
text: the big sofas, the bare boards, paintings, overflowing
text: bookshelves, Sunday papers.
text: She sits in an armchair and finds herself semi-recumbent such
text: is its hidden depth. A GIRL of 15 drifts in. She quietly
text: observes as Barbara struggles to sit up.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You must be Polly.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Must be. Hi.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I’m Barbara.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Hi, Barbara.
text: Polly’s contempt is instantaneous but she makes a vague stab
text: at concealing it.
text: She flops into a sofa, sips her bottle of Evian.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Are you going somewhere?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: You’re all poshed up.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh...I have an appointment. Later. In town.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Have you always lived here?
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Mum inherited it. It’s her little joke -
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (coming in)
dialog: - I only married her for the property.
text: He carries an opened bottle of wine and glasses.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (To Polly)
dialog: Morning.
text: He hands drinks round.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Did Pete go?
text: Polly nods.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: He was welcome to stay.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: He’s not really into lunch.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (To Barbara)
text: cheers.
speaker_heading: IB
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Mom. What is it?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: A witless Chardonnay.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Are you interested in wine?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Only the drinking part. You?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Well, I spent a portion of the summer on the
dialog: Amalfi coast and I became-
text: She's interrupted by loud thumps as someone thunders down the
dialog: wooden stairs.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Here’s trouble...
text: BEN runs in and leaps head first onto the sofa.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Easy, Rocky! Easy!
text: Ben is twelve. He has Down’s Syndrome. Barbara didn’t know.
text: She watches Richard and his son playfully fighting with each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: I'd anticipated a suave, young lawyer and two
dialog: perfect poppets. Not so. She's married some
dialog: crumbling patriarch - he’s nearly as old as
dialog: me!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER
text: Everyone sat at the big table, eating their slightly burnt
dialog: lasagne and salad-
text: Barbara has a tiny portion, almost untouched. She conceals it
text: with a large lettuce leaf.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: And then there’s the daughter; a pocket
dialog: princess.
text: Polly picks at her food, uninterested.
speaker_heading: ; BARBARA (V.0.)
text: And finally, a somewhat tiresome court jester.
dialog: Ben wolfs his food down, makin hi s i
text: habitually. 1 g a mess which Sheba wipes up
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I’m going to be a wizard.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh? ...Is that when you‘re a growh up...?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: No, he’s just been cast in his school play!
text: Ben beams with pride as Sheba hugs him.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (critic’s voice)
dialog: Amongst next year’s cultural highlights I
dialog: greatly look forward to Benjamin Hart in the
dialog: key role of ‘The Wizard’. Indeed I find myself
dialog: to be beside myself with anticipation for this
text: doubtless auspicious stage debut.
text: As Richard continues...
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
text: A rogue image swam through me, hubby’s pruney
text: old mouth pursed at Sheba’s breast.
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM - LATER
text: Sheba and Ben are dancing to ‘Funky Kingston’ by Toots and
text: the Maytals up loud on the Bang & Olufsen.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
text: After lunch a rather mortifying family
dialog: tradition...
text: Sheba’s quite drunk and having a ball. Richard moves to his
text: own slower rhythm amusing the delighted Ben.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: They do things differently in bourgeois
dialog: bohemia.
text: Polly and Barbara, sour bedfellows on the sofa, both mortally
dialog: embarrassed.
text: Polly offers Barbara a fag which she accepts gratefully.
dialog: 0
text: As the music continues Barbara's expression changes: her
dialog: admiration for Sheba’s enthusiasm, her love for her son, her
dialog: natural warmth, her beauty...
text: As Sheba dances Barbara is almost overcome by her.
text: Richard grooves up and encourages Polly to join in. She bats
text: him away and draws on her Marlboro Light. Now he tries to
text: haul Barbara to her feet, she protests but he's relentless.
text: Polly - the traitor - ‘helps’ her up.
text: Barbara stands in the centre of the room. An awkward moment
text: as she half raises her arms for a formal dance but Richard’s
dialog: not there to reciprocate.
text: Ben grabs Barbara’s hand and they dance.
text: A mobile phone rings - unheard by all except Polly. She
text: passes it to her mother.
text: Sheba goes out into the hallway to speak. Her conversation
text: seems intense, possibly furtive...
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN ~ LATER
text: Richard and Ben are playing French Cricket. The garden is
text: large, rambling and overgrown.
text: Barbara and Sheba head to a partially concealed SUMMER HOUSE
text: at the back. Sheba carries coffee and biscuits on a tray.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about Ben - not
dialog: that it’s - just sometimes people don’t quite
dialog: know how to react.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Wot at ali, he’s charming.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Has it been difficult?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Well, you just get on with it, don’t you?
dialog: Polly’s the tricky one but who isn’t at
dialog: fifteen? I was impossible.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Surely not!
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Wilful and flighty - lethal combination. You?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I think I was rather quiet.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Did you want children?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Mmm. But I never found the time.
text: They reach the large, bashed up Summer house.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: How wonderful.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Richard took me away for our wedding
dialog: anniversary, years ago. When we got back it
dialog: was here, as if by magic.
text: They go inside.
scene_heading: INT. SUMMER HOUSE -— CONTINUOUS.
text: Barbara sips her coffee, conscious she’s in Sheba’s ‘lair’
dialog: and feeling privileged to be so.
text: The ‘studio’ is full of Sheba’s pottery works, drawings and
text: sketches. A comfy, messy den of curios and artefacts.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: It was supposed to be my studio but it’s more
dialog: of a refuge really.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
text: A room of one’s own.
text: There’s a big stack of vinyl LP’s and 7” singles by the
text: stereo. A large photo pinned to the wall amongst a collage of
text: other images. Sheba as a teemager with a gang of friends,
text: exotically dressed in post punk splendour - heavy eye make up
text: etc. Threatening, confident, sexy.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Is this you?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Well...it was.
text: Barbara admires some glazed plates on a shelf.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I like these. Such vibrant colours.
dialog: ae
dialog: 3
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Take one. Take two. Have the lot actually.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh, I couldn’t possibly.
text: Sheba takes a few down and hands them to her.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Honestly, no one else wants them.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I’ll treasure them.
dialog: Too intense, too much - Barbara knows it.
text: Sheba starts wrapping the plates in old newspaper. Barbara
text: carefully sits on a rickety chair.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It must be exhausting, running a family and
dialog: teaching as well?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I can’t wait for term to end. Roll on
dialog: Christmas and a month of sod all. Oh, I
dialog: shouldn’t have kidded myself I could teach.
dialog: I’ve spent the last ten years looking after
dialog: Ben - I was desperate to get out and do
dialog: something - finally we got him into this great
dialog: local school and I'm free to work and...
text: She shakes her head at the difficulty of it all.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You’‘re going to be a terrific teacher.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Thanks, but I’m bloody hopeless and everyone
dialog: knows it.
text: She finishes with the plates and flops into the shabby, old
dialog: sofa.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Children are feral, don’t let them sense your
dialog: anxiety.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: How do you cope?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh, I’m a battle-axe. I’m not popular but at
dialog: least they respect me.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Well, you’re popular with me.
text: Barbara smiles. A hint of therapist and patient. Barbara on
text: her chair, Sheba on the couch - the hip bone exposed, the
text: ankles, her hands waving as she continues to talk.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0)
dialog: She spoke of her ‘vile’ mother, her grief over
dialog: the death of her father, the glory days when
text: Richard scooped her up and then jettisoned his
dialog: wife and children for what she called a ‘non
dialog: stop fuckfest.’ It's a peculiar trait of the
dialog: privileged: immediate, incautious intimacy.
dialog: But Sheba went well beyond the tendencies of
dialog: her class. She was utterly candid; a novice
dialog: confessing to the mother superior.
text: It’s getting dark outside. Richard and Ben have gone in.
text: The atmosphere in the Summer House is intimate now, sisterly.
dialog: Sheba concludes her long speech:
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: But you know, marriage and kids, it’s
dialog: wonderful but it doesn’t give you meaning. It
dialog: gives you an imperative but it doesn’t help
dialog: you...my father used to say - you know on the
dialog: tube - ‘Mind The Gap’.
text: Barbara looks a little confused.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I dunno, the distance between life as you
dialog: dream it and...
dialog: (softly)
dialog: ...life as it is.
text: Barbara stares at her, rapt.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I know exactly what you mean.
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM - THAT NIGHT
text: CLOSE: A gold star on a page of Barbara’s diary-
speaker_heading: WS
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: A gold star day!
text: She sticks the star down with her thumb.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0O.)
dialog: I aiways knew we’d be friends. Out mutual
dialog: reserve inhibited us but now it is manifest; a
dialog: spiritual recognition!
text: As she continues to write we see the strangely anodyne
dialog: possessions of her life: the trinkets, the cat toys, etc.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALL ~ DAY
text: Assembly. Pabblem making announcements. The PUPILS sit in
text: rows. STAFF on a raised platform.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: ‘S’ and I share the ability to see through the
dialog: quotidian awfulness of things. In a different
dialog: (better) age we would be ladies of leisure;
dialog: lunching together, visiting galleries,
dialog: travelling, putting the world to rights.
text: Barbara sits behind Sheba who is casually twirling the hair
text: at the back of her neck. A strand falls into Barbara’s lap.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: We would be companions.
text: The strand of hair taut between her fingers.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALL - LATE AFTER-NOON (DECEMBER)
text: The school carol concert. The last day of term.
text: A school band on stage doing a ‘rap’ version of ‘Hark The
text: Herald Angels Sing’. Toasting each other, the hoods, the
dialog: attitude.
text: Sue Hodge is conducting them, gleefully.
text: Pabblem beams. This is what his school is all about.
text: Brian is into the groove. He wears a Tottenham Hotspur
text: baseball cap and stuffs a mince pie in his gob.
dialog: Gita fakes enjoyment — in common with many other staff_
text: The kids are allowed to ‘dress down’. Some are in festive
text: fancy dress. Some clap along. Others throw food around.
text: Barbara sits at the end of a row. An empty seat beside her.
text: Bill tries to sit in it but Barbara says it’s reserved.
text: She looks around for Sheba. Not here. she slips out of the
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. BARBARA’S CLASSROOM.
text: Barbara goes over to the window and looks out. It’s dark
text: outside. There’s a dim light on in the Art Studio.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR.
text: Barbara heads for the exit. Christmas decorations and
text: children’s art fill the walls.
text: The rap music echoes down the empty corridor.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND.
text: The playground in darkness. Barbara heads towards the Art
text: Studio. The light still on. But then it goes out.
text: Barbara waits for Sheba to emerge. But she doesn’t.
text: Now Barbara approaches, perplexed...
text: She hears a noise - a chair scraping back - male laughter, a
dialog: ‘shhh’ - silence.
text: Barbara sneaks up to a window. Standing on tip toes she can
dialog: just see inside.
text: Darkness. Footsteps. A murmur...
text: And then...a match...a tiny flare of light. And then an
text: orange glow - a cigarette.
text: Still she can’t see properly, her eyes beginning to adjust.
text: She can make out Sheba’s desk now...
text: and Sheba sitting on her chair at the desk...
dialog: er shirt undone to the waist...
text: Barbara holds her breath.
dialog: alo
dialog: ot
dialog: Sheba’s mouth - she’s saying something...
text: And now the orange glow comes back into view.
text: She sees a white shirt. A man holding a cigarette.
dialog: Sheba gesturing - something to do with the cigarette...
text: The man stands in front of Sheba.
text: A playful exchange of words. He puts the cigarette out.
text: Sheba nods and then undoes his zip. Pulls him towards her.
text: Barbara watching as Sheba gives head.
text: The man comes quickly. Sheba’s hand on his mouth, silencing
dialog: him.
text: Barbara’s hand on her own mouth.
text: Distant applause and stamping. The carol concert’s finished.
text: The lovers hear the applause. They kiss passionately.
text: Sheba buttons her shirt. He goes to the door and slips out.
text: Barbara edges round the building to see him...it’s that boy —
text: fifteen year old - STEVEN CONNOLLY.
text: Barbara grips the wall for support.
text: Steven heads towards the school gates pulling his coat on and
text: lugging his school bag over his shoulder.
text: The Art Studio lights flash on.
text: Barbara turns back, sees Sheba picking something from the
text: floor - a fag butt. She wraps it in paper and pockets it.
text: CHILDREN and STAFF start streaming out the school doors.
text: Barbara alone for a moment before she’s engulfed.
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Barbara sat in her armchair, still in shock. Thinking.
scene_heading: EXT. SUPERMARKET CAR PARK - DAY
text: Sheba and Ben loading the car with their shopping. Sheba
text: humps a box of mineral water into the boot.
text: Her mobile rings, she answers.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0)
dialog: It’s Barbara. I need to talk to you about
dialog: Steven Connolly.
dialog: Sheba freezes. The best she can do:
speaker_heading: SHEBA (IN PHONE)
dialog: Who...?
speaker_heading: INTERCUT AS
speaker_heading: NECESSARY
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM - SAME TIME
text: A thin smile from Barbara.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (IN PHONE)
dialog: Let’s not, shall we? I’m afraid I’ve learnt of
dialog: your ‘activities’.
text: Sheba - horrified - before she can respond:
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Doubtless you're aware you could go to jail.
dialog: I’m driving to Eastbourne tonight, I’m
dialog: spending Christmas with my sister. I’1l be
dialog: with you at five.
text: Barbara puts the phone down. Silence.
text: Then, a strange CROAK. Her cat, Portia, has vomited at her
dialog: feet.
scene_heading: EXT. SHEBA’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
text: Before Barbara can knock Sheba comes out in her coat.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Let’s go to the pub, OK?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I brought you this, for all of you.
dialog: a
text: Barbara hands her a bottle of sherry. Sheba looks at. it like
text: it’s a bomb, then deposits it inside the door.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHGATE STREETS/PUB - MOMENTS LATER
text: They walk in silence. Sheba sick with fear. Barbara has to
dialog: double her pace to keep up.
text: They arrive at the pub. It’s festooned with festive cheer. A
text: couple of drunks barge past them singing carols.
text: Barbara gestures to a wooden table with benches, chained to
text: the wall outside - quieter.
scene_heading: EXT. PUB - LATER
text: Sheba and Barbara sat with their drinks - a dry sherry and a
text: hefty scotch. Barbara lights a cigarette. Sheba is shaking
dialog: with fear (and cold).
speaker_heading: ‘SHEBA
dialog: So...when...when will you tell them?
text: Barbara is inscrutable, relishing her power.
speaker_heading: BARBARA,
dialog: I need to know the circumstances. You must
dialog: inform me of everything.
text: Sheba takes a slug of her drink, her only option to comply.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Actually, you were there, when I first noticed
dialog: him...
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND — FLASHBACK
text: A roar. Steven scores his goal then whips his shirt off and
text: points in glory at Sheba.
speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.0O.)
dialog: I think you gave him a telling off.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V-.0O.)
dialog: No, I gave him a slight ticking off.
text: Sheba gives Steven a little smile-
speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.0.)
dialog: Be dedicated his goal to me. It was just a
dialog: sweet thing, it amused me.
text: Steven runs off past Barbara who tells him to put his shirt
dialog: back on.
text: But Sheba continues to gaze at the boy - his smooth skin, his
text: hips, his muscles moving as he pulls the shirt over his head.
scene_heading: INT. ART STUDIO - AFTER-NOON
text: Sheba alone, repairing her torn posters.
speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.0.)
dialog: A few days later he came to see me.
text: steven comes in carrying a large envelope.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Miss, would you look at my drawings, please?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I’1l look at them in class. You do Art, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I’m not allowed...
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: I'm special needs. I gotta do extra reading
dialog: instead.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: You did these at home?
text: He nods and hands her the envelope.
text: Sheba looks at the boy’s ‘work’. Pencil sketches of fruit, a4
text: can of coke, a woman vaguely like herself, his own hands..-
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: These are good. You can draw.
text: Steven is thrilled.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Hands are very difficult, aren’t they?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yeah, they’re a right bastard.
dialog: =O
dialog: 3
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: You have to really study them, the bone
dialog: structure...look...
text: She does a quick sketch of his hands. She's talented, deft.
text: Her sketch is simple but clear.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Can I keep it, Miss?
text: She hands it to him - unsure if she’s already crossed a line.
speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.0.)
dialog: I told him I’d speak to the Deputy Head, look
dialog: into his timetable.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Sheba with Ted Mawson. Kids streaming past between lessons.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: If we started pulling strings for one child
dialog: the whole system would unravel.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: But he’s talented, he’s actually found
dialog: something he believes in!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: ch, they’re all talented!
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PUB - EVENING
text: Sheba and Barbara at their table. Barbara looks steely-
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You’d found your ‘gem’ as Sue would say?
speaker_heading: SHEBA .
dialog: I said I’d teach him after school, but only if
dialog: he felt like it. It’s our job, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: BARBARA |
dialog: Within specified hours and a specified
dialog: curriculum.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: He came every day for two weeks. Yes, i was
dialog: flattered but more than that I was excited to
dialog: find someone who actualiy wanted to learn.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: But you must’ve suspected his motives?
scene_heading: INT. ART STUDIO - DAY
text: Sheba showing Steven a book of Da Vinci’s drawings-
speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.0.)
dialog: I sensed he had a little crush on me but so
dialog: what? It was innocent.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: So he invented a sort of helicopter five
dialog: hundred years ago? Does your brain in.
text: Sheba smiles, charmed by him.
text: ANOTHER DAY: Steven’s new drawing of his hands. A slight
dialog: improvement.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: That’s so much better. Look, you’ve absolutely
dialog: got that knuckle.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (grins )
dialog: Nailed it.
text: She’s pleased for him and ruffles his hair. Mistake. She
dialog: knows it instantly.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Do that again, Miss.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Don’t be silly. off you go-
text: She gets up, starts tidying, pushing chairs under desks. He
text: leaps up to help her.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What you having for tea, Miss?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I don’t know, I’11 probably buy something on
dialog: the way home.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Are you a good cook?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You suck?
text: Pause. She narrows her eyes.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Go home, Steven.
text: He stares at her and then leaves. Sheba puts on her coat.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: That’s when you should've stopped it.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE SPORTS HALL - DAY
speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.0.)
dialog: I did! I told him I wouldn’t teach him
dialog: anymore.
text: Busy lobby area. Sheba comes out of a meeting, carrying
dialog: papers and files.
text: Steven, in sports kit, suddenly throws her a football.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Miss!
text: Sheba catches it and sternly hands it back to him.
speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.O.)
dialog: He wouldn’t accept it. He just kept coming
dialog: back.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - ANOTHER DAY
text: Sheba cycling home. She passes Steven in the street. He gazes

scene_heading: EXT. DELICATESSEN/STREET - ANOTHER DAY
text: Sheba comes out with a bag of shopping. Steven is polishing

speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I live here.
text: He gestures to the tower blocks of a grim looking estate.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: ‘S’‘alright, apart from the crack’eads and
dialog: that. Some bloke got stabbed last week-
text: Sheba looks concerned. He steadies the bike as she fiddles
text: with the chunky lock.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I’m going now. Good day to you, young man.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: D’you wanna come for a walk?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Absolutely not! I‘m going home to my family.
dialog: As should you.
text: She climbs on the bike. He’s still holding the handlebars.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: My Dad’s got the hump. He got sacked, been
dialog: taking it out on me.
text: He gestures with his arm, Sheba looks shocked.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: He hits you?
text: Steven vaguely nods, embarrassed-
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Does your mother know?
dialog: 
dialog: _ a
dialog: She looks at
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (shakes head)
dialog: She's got this kidney problem, been waiting
dialog: months for an operation. I don’t wanna give
dialog: her more grief.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: You could call the Social Services. They’11
dialog: come and see him, give him a warning.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I’11 be alright.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: If he does it again you tell me, OK?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Thanks, Miss.

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You're beautiful, Miss. You don’t know how
dialog: beautiful you are.
text: Before she can respond he’s on his way.
scene_heading: EXT. PUB.
text: Barbara looks at Sheba reproachfully.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: (desperately explaining)
dialog: My heart went out to him...he was so
dialog: vulnerable. I knew it was wrong and immoral
dialog: and completely ridiculous but...I don’t
dialog: know...I just...allowed it to happen.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: The boy is fifteen!
speaker_heading: SHEBA
text: But he’s quite mature for his age.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: ‘But’ is not a helpful word here! He’s a minor
dialog: and you’ve broken the law.
text: Sheba nods, chastened, Pupil to teacher.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: This’1l sound sick but something in me
dialog: felt...entitled.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Between lessons. Staff and pupils coming in and out of

dialog: handwritten note.
scene_heading: INT. ART STUDIO — LATER

speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.0.)

scene_heading: INT. SHEBA’S HOUSE, SITTING ROOM/HALL - THAT EVENING.

speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.O.)
dialog: ‘Why shouldn’t you transgress? You've earned

dialog: 7.45.

speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Sue phoned, OK if I go for a drink?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Sure. I‘1l put bugalugs to bed.

speaker_heading: SHEBA

text: Polly points to her phone ‘I’m busy’ - and slopes upstairs.
scene_heading: EXT. PUB.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Why Sue?

speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Dunno, first person I thought of.
dialog: On Barbara: disappointed.
scene_heading: EX£. RAILWAY ARCH - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.0.)
dialog: I remembered that gorgeous feeling, like being
dialog: sixteen. I’m going to give you what you want
dialog: and you don’t know it yet.
text: Steven is waiting there, smoking.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Evening, Miss.
text: She looks him in the eye.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Have you done this before?
text: He nods but his cockiness is slightly diminished.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Not with someone like you, I mean...a proper
dialog: woman .
text: She touches his cheek, tenderly. They walk together.
scene_heading: EXT. DISUSED RAILWAY YARD ~ NIGHT
text: Sheba follows Steven down an ‘alley’ between a disused train
dialog: and a siding.
text: Steven stops. A clearing. He puts his coat down.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Make yourself comfortable.
text: He looks at Sheba, barely believing his luck.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: It's incredibly important that we keep this
dialog: secret. Does anyone know you’re here?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: You can’t tell anyone, ever.
text: She stares at him. He takes her hand, soothes her...
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Miss, I’m no genius but I aint no dickhead. I
dialog: wont tell anyone. You can trust me.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: (distantly)
dialog: We'd both get into terrible trouble.
text: Steven looks into her eyes. She kisses him. They fall onto
text: the ground. They start making out like teenagers - laughter,
text: gasps and elbow banging.
speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.O.)
dialog: It was easy. Like having another drink when
dialog: you know you shouldn’t.
dialog: Sheba and Steven fucking. Semi-clothed. It’s very quick.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Miss?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: What?
text: He murmurs in her ear.
dialog: 33
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: What?
dialog: (he murmurs again)
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Can I come inside you?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Yes!
text: And he does. Sheba holds him tight.
text: LATER: Steven lies on her stomach. She strokes his hair. He
text: reaches for his cigarettes. Thinks.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Can I smoke, Miss?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: You can do what you want. But enough of this
dialog: ‘miss’.
text: He grins. Lights a fag, offer her one, she shakes her head.
text: Steven cracks open a can of beer and offers her the other.
text: She takes it and swigs some. He watches her intently.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Were you a model once?
text: Sheba shakes her head.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You shoulda been. You’re well fit.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: “Gosh but don’t I know it’.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You're into ‘The Streets’?!
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: My daughter is.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: She the same age as me?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: None of your beeswax.
dialog: He’s smart enough not to persist.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Anyway, the point is you’re fit.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Well, so are you.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You reckon? My sister says I look like a

speaker_heading: SHEBA

text: It’s freezing cold and they start to button up their clothes.
text: But Steven can’t bear to let her go, he stops her doing up
text: her shirt, kisses her.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You wanna do it again?
dialog: Sheba smiles. Men can’t do this.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What? What?
text: She laughs then sees he’s getting upset.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Yes. I want to do it again.
text: She pulls him towards her and feels his cock.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I want to do it again.
scene_heading: INT. SHEBA’S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT
text: Sheba parks her bike in the hall. As she checks herself in
text: the mirror, an angry voice from the sitting room:
speaker_heading: RICHARD (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, you TART! You feckless bitch!
text: Sheba freezes - then realizes he’s shouting at the TV.
text: She goes into the sitting room. Richard is slobbed out on the
text: sofa, remote control perched on his belly. He raises an arm
dialog: in greeting.
speaker_heading: HI
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I’m dying! These people are killing me! I’m
dialog: having a coronary right here on this sofa.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Love one. Add a vat of scotch will you?
dialog: (At TV)
dialog: ANSWER THE QUESTION! It’s ‘yes’ or ‘no’ you
dialog: dozy, old bastard!
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Change channels.
text: She goes in to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I keep flipping back. I'm in an orgy of
dialog: masochism.
text: Sheba starts making coffee.
text: The fridge with its collage of family photos and school
dialog: schedules. The clutter of family life...
scene_heading: EXT. PUB - NIGHT
text: Barbara stubs another cigarette out, she’s realized
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: The day we met, it had already begun?
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR —- (FLASHBACK)
text: The ‘Homework Club’ day. Steven and Davis getting a dressing
text: down from Barbara as Sheba watches.
speaker_heading: SHEBA (V.O-)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0-)
dialog: you had further relations that day?
scene_heading: EXT. PUB-
dialog: Sheba thinks, truth is best policy here.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: We went to the Art room.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Well, I’m glad I was such an aphrodisiac. I
dialog: was trying to help you.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: And you did. I’m incredibly grateful. You've
dialog: been such a good friend.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (quietly)
text: Not reciprocated it seems.
text: Sheba suddenly sees that Barbara’s anger is personal ~— and
text: potentially explosive. She proceeds carefully...
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I desperately wanted to confess to you. But
dialog: how could I? ...Barbara...?
text: She waits until Barbara looks at her.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: It would've put you in an impossible
dialog: situation. But I so wish I had. You’d have
dialog: made me see sense.
dialog: Barbara considers, is Sheba ‘playing’ her? No, impossible.
text: They sit in silence. Barbara watches Sheba - then blinks:
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: And then I realized my fury had blinded me...
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Do we need moxre drinks?
text: Barbara nods, miles away.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: But can we go inside? I’m freezing.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V-.0O.)

scene_heading: INT. PUB -— MOMENTS LATER
text: Sheba at the bax, Barbara at a table.
dialog: Yo
dialog: 43
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: With stealth I might secure the prize, long
dialog: texm, forever in my debt...
text: Sheba heads back to Barbara carrying the new drinks.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V-0.)
dialog: I could gain everything. By doing... nothing.
text: Sheba sits, fraught with anxiety. Barbara lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I..-I know you have to tell them; the head,
dialog: the school, whoever. All I ask is you wait
dialog: ‘til the new year? I’m begging you, please,
dialog: let me have this christmas with my family...?
text: She’s almost in tears. Barbara stares at her. Then smiles.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I think you’ve misunderstood me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm your friend. We’re friends.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I know. Of course. But...
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh, you poor thing, have you got yourself ina
dialog: terrible state? I’m not going to report you. I
dialog: only want to help you, to support you through
dialog: this.
text: She gives Sheba a tender squeeze on the hand.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: You’re not going to tell?
text: Barbara shakes her head. Sheba is overcome with relief.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: You won't tell anyone?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Who would it benefit? Not you nor the boy and
dialog: certainly not the school. No. It’s a private
dialog: matter and we must keep it so0-
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Yes — maybe I should resign?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No, no, no! That might alert suspicion. You
dialog: must stay at the school but the affair has to
dialog: end.
dialog: (Sheba nods)
dialog: Immediately. Your solemn promise. I can’t help
dialog: you unless you promise.
text: Sheba realizes that Barbara means it literally.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I - I promise.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Will it be difficult?
text: Sheba stares into her glass.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: He’ll be very upset. He comes from such
dialog: a...loveless home.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You’re not in love?
text: Sheba looks up, an innocent. She gives a slight nod. Barbara
text: tries not to react but is clearly shocked.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I know it’s appalling and illegal and
dialog: unethical but I’m hopelessly besotted.
text: Barbara looks vaguely sick.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Sorry. When you’re in love you want to tell
dialog: the whole world about it.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I wouldn’t though.
text: They manage to share a grim smile.
speaker_heading: BARBARA .
dialog: But isn’t it..-just a physical thing, mainly?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Well...
dialog: (raises an eyebrow)
dialog: I can’t tell you.

scene_heading: EXT. PUB/STREET - LATER
text: Barbara and Sheba walking.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: I played the maiden aunt but I’m well aware of
text: the proclivities of the fifteen year old male.
dialog: Even I have been the subject of their
text: graffitied yearnings in the school toilets. By
text: law they are children, but their grim, pungent
dialog: urges are entirely adult...
text: They arrive at Barbara’s car.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: So you'll tell him straight after Christmas?
text: Sheba nods, determinedly.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: All for the best.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I know. Thank you so much. You've been so
dialog: brilliant.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: And you’ll tell me when it’s done?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Yes.
text: A big hug. Then, Sheba sees the travelling cat box on the
text: passenger seat. Portia is asleep.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: You never said...
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Standard issue for spinsters.
dialog: (frowns )
dialog: She’s been off her food recently, I’m a bit
dialog: worried about her...
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: There’s a terrific vet up the read, he was
dialog: great with Ben’s rabbit.
text: Barbara lingers, relishing this time with Sheba.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Have you got many people coming tomorrow?
speaker_heading: SHEBA

speaker_heading: BARBARA

speaker_heading: Ylo
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Ha!
text: She tries to steal it from him.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Don’t snatch! Wait ‘til tomorrow!
text: He chucks the present under the Christmas tree.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You’ve been gone ages.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: oh, Barbara was...just some school thing.
text: He pours some wine for them.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: fow’s his nibs?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Still awake, madly excited, I said he could
dialog: wait up for you.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: And her ladyship?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (points upstairs)
text: ‘Depressed’. Pete phoned. They had a barney,
dialog: he’s not coming tomorrow.
dialog: They share a moment of parental sadness-
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Do you think he’s bad news?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well, these older men can be very dodgy.
text: She smiles, suddenly kisses him, passionately. Richard is
text: slightly surprised but responds in kind.
scene_heading: INT. POLLY’‘S BEDROOM - LATER.
text: Polly is lying on her bed, i-Pod on, smoking. She's been

speaker_heading: SHEBA

text: The white stuccoed Regency hotel.
text: Sounds of festive music from a jazz combo.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - SAME TIME
text: A huge ornate room packed with the elderly, the infirm and
text: their families. A smali band playing on a raised area.
text: Barbara surveys the room: an old man spilling his soup, an
text: old woman tottering in on her crutches, an elderly couple
text: struggling to pull their cracker.
text: She's mid~lunch with her family: her sister, MARJORIE, with
dialog: husband, DAVE, also their daughter LORRAINE and her husband
dialog: MARTIN. They all wear paper hats,
text: Barbara is deep in thought, ruminating on Sheba...
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: Her fetish for the boy was simply her snobbery
dialog: manifested; ‘he’s working class and he likes
dialog: Art’. Bs if he were a monkey who’d just
dialog: strolled out of the rain forest and asked for
text: a gin and tonic.
dialog: eee
dialog: a
text: She straightens her paper crown, oblivious to everything.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Ba! Wakey wakey!
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Lorraine was asking if you’d heard from that
dialog: nice friend of yours?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Jennifer.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh...yes. She left the school, she’s teaching
dialog: at a Primary in Stoke. There’s a chap
dialog: apparently. I heard they’re engaged.
text: Lorraine and Martin stifle a giggle but Barbara’s seen it.
dialog: She bides her time...
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: How's your eczema, Martin?
text: He shakes his head, a sad look in his eyes.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Bit grim. But Lorraine's found this top
dialog: specialist in Hastings.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: He’s state of the art. He'll give it a really
dialog: good bash in the new year.
text: She puts an arm round her disconsolate husband. Barbara
text: eyeballs the hapless couple.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It must be so distressing - for both of you.
text: Marjorie squeezes her son in law’s crusty hand.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: You’ve been in my prayers all year.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
text: Fingers crossed for a Christmas miracle.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (raises his glass)
dialog: And so say all of us!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, SHEBA’S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: In contrast: noise, hubbub and mayhem. Booze, food, mess.
text: Round the big table: Richard, Polly, Ben. Richard's first
dialog: wife MARCIA and their daughters SASKIA and CLAIRE. Sheba‘s
text: older brother EDDIE with his WIFE and their infant BoYs.
text: Sat next to Ben, Sheba‘s MOTHER (MRS TAYLOR) ~ a formidable
dialog: woman in her sixties.
text: Sheba gets up, gives Polly a little squeeze then fetches more
text: cream from the fridge.
text: Her mobile beeps, a text message. She reads: ‘happyxmas miss!
dialog: wish i woz fucking u blind rite now’
text: Sheba looks around - her mother is watching her. She deletes

scene_heading: INT. SHEBA'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: Sheba outside the half open sitting room door with a tray of
text: coffees. Sheba’s mother is sat with Marcia.
speaker_heading: MRS TAYLOR
dialog: Her father was an exceptional man.
dialog: Exceptional. Bathsheba’s a loner I'm afraid.
dialog: She’s beautiful (thank God) - and it’s got her
dialog: through —- but it’s not quite the same as
dialog: possessing substance.
text: Sheba listening in horror.
speaker_heading: MARCIA
dialog: Mmm, strong personality, weak character.
speaker_heading: MRS TAYLOR
dialog: She's a time bomb, actually. Non~bonders are
dialog: always dangerous -
text: Marcia nods, knowingly. Sheba is really stung. But she goes
text: in with the tray.
text: The women smile as she serves them theix coffec.
scene_heading: EXT. SHEBA’S HOUSE - EVENING
text: Sheba comes out the front door and down the steps with two
text: black bin bags crammed full of rubbish.
text: As she’s stuffing the bags into the front bins:
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Happy Christmas.
text: Steven is lurking near the car. He hands her a little
text: package. Sheba glances at the house ~ the front door is open.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Everyone’s inside! Please, you have to go!
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Aren’t you gonna open it?
text: She quickly opens the package,
speaker_heading: STEVEN
text: It’s made of real fake gold.
text: It’s a cheap, gold necklace with an ‘S’ on it. It glints in
text: her hand. She’s touched by the gesture.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What’s up? I haven’t heard from you...
text: She motions him back to the side of the house where it’s
text: hidden from the front door.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I - I can’t see you anymore - I’m sorry - I’m
dialog: really sorry.
text: She’s beside herself. He pulls her towards him.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I can’t, it’s over.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: RICHARD (0.S.)
dialog: Bash?!
text: They freeze. Richard’s legs appear above them at the top of
text: the outside stairs. Then a bag of rubbish.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Bash?
dialog: (To someone inside)
dialog: She’s not here!
text: Richard dumps the bag on the doorstep, groaning a bit with
dialog: drunk exhaustion.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh, sod it.
text: He goes inside closing the front door behind him.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: Was that your Dad?
text: Sheba is stunned.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: No. He...he’s my uncle...
text: She stares at Steven. Lost. He returns her gaze.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: D’you wanna end it?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I - I ~ don’t look at me like that.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Have you gone off me?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: No - I - you should go. Please.
dialog: Don’t...just...you have to go now.
text: He strokes her cheek, she catches his hand.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: It’s stupid.
text: He gives her a slight grin.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Go away.
text: He shakes his head-
dialog: Joe
dialog: ae

speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Go.

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE ~ MINUTES LATER
text: Sheba comes in and nearly bumps into Polly who’s heading
text: upstairs - she’s on her mobile.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Is it him?
text: Polly nods happily and climbs the stairs, still talking.
text: Sheba watches her daughter go ~ natural teenage love.
text: Sheba goes into the kitchen, contemplates the necklace. One
text: of Eddie’s kids runs in. Sheba stuffs the necklace into her
text: pocket. The boy runs out with the plastic cup he was looking
dialog: for.
text: Sheba loads dirty crockery into the dishwasher.
text: Family noises from the sitting room.
text: She takes out a sachet of detergent, opens it with her teeth.
text: She stares at the hard tablet, the little ball in its centre.

speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: Writing the old diary? I can’t imagine how you
dialog: keep at it. I'd have nothing to say.
text: Marjorie sits on the bed, settling in for a sisterly chat.
speaker_heading: MARJORIE
dialog: You know you’re welcome whenever you want? Not
dialog: just once a year.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It’s just...I’m rather busy at the moment.

dialog: smart wrapping paper.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh my word, Asprey.
text: She takes out a sterling silver photo frame engraved with the
dialog: name ‘Portia’.

speaker_heading: SHEBA

speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: You’re cocky.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You love it.

dialog: exploring her territory.
text: He turns back, she’s deep in thought, considering what he’s
dialog: suggested...
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I was only making conversation. It’s polite to

speaker_heading: STEVEN

dialog: There's a good girl.
text: Sheba opens her eyes, tries to remain polite...
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I think that’s enough.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Close your eyes.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: I really think that’s enough, Barbara.
text: She stares her out. Barbara stands her ground but is wretched
dialog: with humiliation.
text: But now her focus changes from Sheba’s face to over her
dialog: shoulder:
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: There's someone in your garden!
text: She points through the French windows. Sheba turns. At the
text: foot of the garden a FIGURE jumps down from the back wall and
text: slips into the Summer House.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: A thief - he came over the wall!
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Oh - it’ll be one of the neighbours’ boys,
dialog: lost his ball.
text: Sheba knows it’s Steven - prays he stays put.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No, he’s gone into your summer house - quick,
dialog: phone the police!
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: It’s just a kid from next door, forget it!
text: Sheba’s mobile rings again. They both stare at it - Sheba
text: paralysed - and now Barbara twigs it. She snatches the phone
dialog: and answers:
speaker_heading: STEVEN (V.0.)
dialog: Where are you? I want your hot, sweet cunt
dialog: right now!
text: Barbara listens, sickness rising in her. She hands the phone
dialog: to Sheba.
speaker_heading: SHEBA (IN PHONE)
dialog: Richard just called, he’s on his way - I can’t
dialog: - I’1l call you.
text: As she speaks Barbara collects her bag and storms to the

speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Barbara!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Barbara’s heading for her car, Sheba catches up.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I’m sorry, Ba. I tried to end it, honestly, I -
dialog: I just couldn’t!
text: Barbara fumbles for her car keys, fighting back tears.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I risked everything for you and in return you
dialog: humiliate me.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I - I - didn’t mean to upset you. Please - I
dialog: need your help more than ever now - pleage,
dialog: don‘t go!
text: Barbara opens the car door.
speaker_heading: BARBARA .
dialog: You promised you’d end it, why didn’t you?
dialog: Sheba is too
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Because...
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (witheringly)
dialog: You’re ‘in love’?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I-I-
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: And the child? Do you imagine he reciprocates
dialog: your soppy ‘feelings’? Oh I dare say he’s
text: fascinated by the neurotic compulsions of a
dialog: middle class lady with marital problems!
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Ba-
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: There’s nothing crueller than the adolescent
dialog: boy, I know them! Once he’s had his fill he’ll
dialog: discard you like an old rag -
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Ba-
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: - and revert to rutting with schoolgirls. YOU
dialog: ARE NOT YOUNG!

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: End it now.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Erm...yes - I - I’m thinking...
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Don’t think - DO! Do! DO! bo!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or shall I sit here polishing my nails until
dialog: your husband returns?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: No ~ no - please - I’ll do it, I promise.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: So what are you waiting for?

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - TEN MINUTES LATER
text: Sheba on her bike, speeding towards Steven’s home.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNCIL ESTATE.
text: Sheba gets off her bike, starts pushing it.
text: To her surprise it’s a clean street, well kept blocks and
dialog: houses. Not the sink estate she’d imagined - or been told of.
text: Kids riding around on bikes. She asks them if they know
text: Steven Connolly. They point her in the right direction.
text: She finds his home - not the tower block but an ordinary
text: Maisonette. She rings the bell.
text: MR CONNOLLY opens the door. He’s a slight man without an
dialog: ounce of aggression in him. She’d expected tattoos and
dialog: brutality.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Mr Connolly? I’m Mrs Hart, from St George’s -
dialog: Steven’s not in trouble. I just need to see
dialog: him about...an art project and I was in the
dialog: area S80...
speaker_heading: MR CONNOLLY
dialog: (amiably)
dialog: of course, come in, come in!
text: He shows her in.
speaker_heading: MR CONNOLLY
dialog: Very good of you to give him these extra
dialog: lessons.
dialog: (calls upstairs)
dialog: Steve! Visitor!
text: He’s holding a remote control. He gestures into the sitting
text: room where there’s a massive TV set, the screen image paused.
speaker_heading: MR CONNOLLY
dialog: I’m watching ‘Amelie’.
dialog: (nods, moved)
dialog: Have you seen it?
text: Sheba shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MR CONNOLLY
dialog: (calls up)
dialog: Steve! Mrs Bart’s here!
dialog: (To Sheba)
dialog: Probably on his mobile, usually is. Why don't
dialog: you go up? First door on the right, probably
dialog: best to knock.
text: He goes back into the front room.
text: Sheba climbs the stairs. The house is spotless. Framed school
text: photos line the walls and there are family shots of Steven
text: with his parents and two sisters.
text: She finds his bedroom door. It says ‘STEVE’S GAFF’ in letters
dialog: cut out from different magazines - punk style-
text: She hears his voice, knocks and goes in. He’s astonished.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (IN PHONE)
dialog: Call you back, OK? Laters.
text: They look at each other.
text: Sheba takes in the adolescent room, shocked at its
text: ‘childishness’: the music posters, football paraphernalia,
text: the kid’s duvet and strewn clothes.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNCIL ESTATE —- MINUTES LATER
text: Sheba pushing her bike. Steven smoking, edgy-
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: So that’s your vicious father?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: You wanted a sob story, I gave it you. Made
dialog: you feel like Bob Geldof.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: You lied to me!
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Oooh, sorry, Miss. D’you prefer it if T lived
dialog: in a shit’ole?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: And your mother?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (sniffs)
dialog: I think she’s gonna pull through. What d‘you
dialog: want, what you doing here?
dialog: And now she has to tell him.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYAREA/COUNCIL ESTATE — LATER
text: Steven sits on a swing, flicking at his fag in fury.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: They’re gonna expel me now!
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: No they won’t. I’1l get the blame if she
dialog: tells.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: As if she won't?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: She likes me, she might not.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Likes you how? Like ‘that’? You giving her one
dialog: ‘n’ all?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: Why are you being so cruel? Why, Steven?
text: He’s chastened. He swings slowly to and away from her.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I really like you. You’re a nice person and
dialog: you’ve been cool. And it's been great, OK?
dialog: But it was s'posed to be fun. Now it’s like
dialog: this serious thing. Whatever shit you’re
dialog: working out, you know; your husband, your kid,
dialog: you - I dunno...I can’t help you.
text: Sheba manages a smile. Determined not to show him her pain.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: So you’re seeing someone else?
text: He looks at her, caught. Nods an apology. She stares at him.
text: A stab of intense jealousy.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: So you just - what - you prefer her? Because
dialog: she’s young? Huh? Because she helps you with
dialog: your sums? What - because she’s so nice and
dialog: tight? I risked my whole life for you, you
dialog: little shit!
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I never asked you to!
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I taught. you how to fuck!
text: Sheba is powerfully conscious she’s out of control. She
text: clenches her fists, holds it in, fights back her tears.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Why are you so upset?
text: She can’t answer. He suddenly gets that she loves him. He
text: glances around.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I’d give you a hug but there’s people who know
dialog: me...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I can't deal with this. I’m not old enough.
text: She’s overcome with guilt, tries to be practical.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Steven. Don’t be embarrassed at school. Ignore
dialog: Me, OK? You’re a sweet boy...and I‘ve loved
dialog: our time together. I’m sorry if I ever harmed
dialog: you.
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You never.

scene_heading: INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY
text: Staff buzzing around, comparing their Christmases, moaning

speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh, just a friend. Jennifer. This was our
dialog: haunt.
text: Sheba conceals her discomfort.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: We were quite chummy for a while. But...the
dialog: poor thing suffered from this terrible

speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Did she go to hospital?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No, she got a job in Stoke.
dialog: Sheba thinks, putting it all together...
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: When was this?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Last summer. I did what I could but she was

dialog: more...
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I’m sure she knows you did your best...you’re
dialog: such a sensitive person.
text: Sheba pats Barbara’s shoulder, Barbara takes her hand.
speaker_heading: BARBARA

text: Barbara is still holding Sheba’s hand.
speaker_heading: BARBARA

scene_heading: INT. VET’S SURGERY - DAY

speaker_heading: VET
dialog: Do you want to stay?

speaker_heading: VET
dialog: Sometimes people find it comforting to see

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: Barbara comes out of the vets. A zombie on the busy street.

dialog: friend.
scene_heading: EXT. SHEBA’S STREET - MINUTES LATER
text: Barbara panting for breath, a broken woman desperately
text: needing comfort. She hurries towards Sheba’s house.
text: Suddenly ~ the Hart’s car comes out their driveway nearly
text: knocking her over. Richard is at the wheel, he parks up, the
text: car skewed on the road, engine running...
text: Ben and Polly are in the back. Barbara sees Polly groaning
text: comically, mockingly - and Ben (who holds his wizard hat) is
text: laughing at his sister’s antics. Sheba is shushing them.
text: Sheba sees Barbara is in great distress, says something to
text: Richard and gets out the car.
text: Barbara falls into her arms, sobbing.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Is it Portia? Oh no.
text: Richard gives Sheba a quizzical look from the car, ‘what’s
text: up’? Sheba grimaces, indicates this might take a while.
text: Richard exhales in frustration and points to his watch —
dialog: ‘we're late’.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I have to go back to the vets...after it’s
dialog: done...will you come with me? I just can’t on
dialog: my own...
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Oh, I - of course I would but...Ben’s doing

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: A play??
speaker_heading: Tp
speaker_heading: SHEBA

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Someone has died!
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I - = know...and ~ and it’s terribly sad.
text: Ben is banging on the car window. Richard shouts at Polly to
text: stop him. She shouts back. It’s mayhem in there.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You owe me this.
text: Richard revs the engine, Sheba turns, impossibly pulled in
dialog: both directions. Richard’s face - ‘We have to go’.
text: Ben looks anxiously from the car. Meanwhile, Barbara’s on the
dialog: turn, Sheba pleads:
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: He’s doing a show for the first time in his
dialog: life!
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: That's your choice is it?
speaker_heading: SHEBA.
dialog: Look -— why - why don’t you come? You’re very
dialog: welcome...
text: Barbara doesn’t hear it.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I thought you understood what friendship
dialog: means .
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: He’s my child!

speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: He’s my son, he’s just a little boy!
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Don’t play the good mother with me.
text: Barbara cyes the car — a threat. But now Richard leaps out
text: and shouts across the bonnet.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Excuse me? Can one of you tell me what’s going
dialog: on? Is this some kind of coven?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: Oh, I can explain perfectly. Would you like me
dialog: to?
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: (jumps in)
dialog: It’s just that Barbara’s had some very bad
dialog: news, about her cat.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (To Barbara)
dialog: My condolences. Poor, poor pussy! Now can I
dialog: have my wife back please?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (fixes him)
dialog: I don’t like your tone.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (fo Sheba)
dialog: Why is she always here? What fucking spell has
dialog: she cast on you?!
text: Polly pokes hex head out the car window.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Ben’s getting really stressed! I think he’s
dialog: gonna blow!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (fo Sheba)
dialog: God‘s sake, woman, will you get in the bloody
dialog: car!
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: GIVE ME A MINUTE WILL YOU! I CAN HANDLE THIS!!
text: Richard storms back to the car.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh - oh ~ so I’m to be handled am I? Like
dialog: toxic waste. So you see me on sufferance? I’m
dialog: an imposition, to be tolerated!
text: Emergency! Sheba hugs Barbara.
dialog: +f
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: No! Of course not! I love our time together!
dialog: I’m your good, good friend.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Then stay with me.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I would if I could. And I’m desperately sorry
dialog: about Portia. But you know I have to go.
text: Sheba gently detaches herself. A moment of reckoning:
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Think very carefully, madam. Be aware of the
dialog: consequences.
text: The car starts pulling away from the kerb, slowly making it’s
dialog: way up the road.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Please don’t make this mean more than it is!
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I need you to stay. I don’t know what 1/11
dialog: do...
text: A herculean honk of the horn - and now Sheba runs for it.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: I’1l phone you later! I promise!
text: Sheba gets in the car. Barbara watches it disappear down the
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O-)
dialog: They always let you down in the end...
scene_heading: EXT. BARBARA'S GARDEN — LATER
text: Barbara digging a hole in the ground with a small trowel.
text: She’s exhausted from the effort, has been sobbing for the

speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: Jennifer said I was ‘too intense’. Meaning
dialog: what exactly?
text: Barbara buries Portia’s body tightly wrapped in a blanket-
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: That I am loyal in my friendships?
text: Then she buries the cat toys and the cat bowl. And with a
text: grim last look - the Asprey frame from Sheba.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: That I will go to the ends of the earth for
dialog: someone I admire?
text: She treads the earth down.
scene_heading: INT. BEN’S SCHOOL - SAME TIME

scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTER-NOON
text: It’s getting dark outside. Barbara sat in her chair.
text: She’s still wearing her ‘gardening’ clothes. Dried mud on her

text: The door bell rings. She goes down the corridor - hoping it’s
text: Sheba come to apologize. She opens the door.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Not disturbing you, am I?
text: She shakes her head, still dazed by the day’s events.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It’s just...I need to talk to you about Mrs

speaker_heading: BARBARA

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Tea?

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You haven’t got a biscuit?
text: Barbara produces a tin and hands it to him.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Cheers.
text: As he munches he notices the muddy trowel on a side table.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Would you like me to take your hat?
text: He removes his Tottenham Hotspur hat and scarf.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Been up the lane. White Hart Lane. Home of the

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Were you victorious?
speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: She's dead.

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh, dear. My condolences. Ahhh. Is this not a

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It’s a very good time.
text: They sit at the kitchen table.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Mrs Hart.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah. Well...it’s just...erm...
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Anything you tell me will be in strictest
dialog: confidence.
text: He nods, gratefully.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: The thing is...I was wondering if she’s...ever
dialog: mentioned me?
text: Barbara’s eyes widen-
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Does she ever...mention me?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Let me think...
text: She puts her fingers to her temples, a little theatrically.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No. Never.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Actually - yes! She mentioned you’d invested
dialog: in a new shirt. I think it was last term.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, T lashed out at Nicole Farhi. The thing
dialog: is...over the last few months, ever since I
dialog: met her really, I’ve...
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Brian, are you in love?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I’ve been a bit bloody obvious, haven’t I?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You’ve been utterly clandestine.
text: He senses she’s mocking him but can’t be sure.
dialog: 48
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: So she mentioned the shirt then?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You do know she’s married?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah but she’s quite flirty. You never know
dialog: with people, do you?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Indeed you don’t.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: But I wouldn’t want to make a move if I’m
dialog: gonna get knocked back. What with staff
dialog: politics and the Head being such a stickler -—
dialog: you have to be really careful these days.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
text: It’s a minefield.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: So...would...do you think you could have a
dialog: word with her? suss the lie of the land?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You’d like me to ask Mrs Hart if she’s
dialog: inclined to commit adultery with you?
dialog: He looks at her - could not be more exposed. But she’s had
text: her fun and is tired of toying with him. To business:
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I don’t want you te suffer more than is
dialog: necessary. No one should. I couldn’t possibly
dialog: speak for Mrs Hart but instinct tells me you
dialog: Might not be her type.
text: Brian nods, crestfallen. Then thinks...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: She’s got a type then?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It’s no reflection on your attractiveness. But

dialog: whispers and so on...
text: She’s alone now, turned away from him, as if he were
text: invisible. Or she in confession.
dialog: I think you might know the boy in question
dialog: ..+.Steven Connolly.
speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: nothing.
text: She draws on her cigarette.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.C.)
dialog: What it’s like to construct an entire weekend

scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM, SHEBA’S HOUSE - EVENING

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What the hell is going on! Will you just stop

speaker_heading: MRS CONNOLLY

speaker_heading: MR CONNOLLY
dialog: There’s nothing here for us.
text: He leads his weeping wife down the path back to the car.

text: his pyjamas. Polly’s voice, taut with vulnerability.
speaker_heading: POLLY

speaker_heading: SHEBA

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Things don’t just - people make them happen.
dialog: You think you’re the only one who’s ever

speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: When you met me I was-—

speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: BECAUSE I AM NOT THE CONFIDANTE OF A CRIMINAL!
dialog: Now...tell me about this ‘friendship’ with Mrs
dialog: Hart...
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I think you’ll find that a friendship between

dialog: reproach, the majority of the staff regard me
dialog: as their moral guardian.

speaker_heading: PABBLEM

speaker_heading: BARBARA

speaker_heading: PABBLEM
dialog: She says it’s because you were stalking her.

speaker_heading: PABBLEM

text: He comes up to her, close. Barbara bustles past him and he
text: follows, impassive, it scares her.
text: She rushes down the stairs to her door, fumbling for the key.
text: He follows after. Just as he comes tearing down the stairs
text: she manages to get in and slam the door. He bangs at the
dialog: window in fury.
text: Inside - Barbara clutches herself in fear and shame. Junk

speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)

speaker_heading: Wp

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Sorry about your job.
text: She's over-emotional and speaks needlessly.
speaker_heading: BARBARA

text: Richard faces Sheba, his back to the front door.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I knew who you were when we met. You were

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You’re a good mother. But at times you’ve been
dialog: a fucking lousy wife. Why didn’t you come to
dialog: me? You could’ve told me how lonely you were.
dialog: You never trusted me to help you.
dialog: I’m not saying I’m so fucking fabulous but I

speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: Of course we've had our ups and downs. The

scene_heading: EXT. BARBARA'S FLAT - DAY

speaker_heading: MALE JOURNALIST
dialog: It’s the crone!
text: Barbara comes up the exterior stairs to ground level. They

text: A few give chase but the majority know it’s not worth it.
text: Back at the flat a curtain twitches and the cameras flash.
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM, FLAT.
text: Sheba closes the curtain. She wears a long, ratty t-shirt,
text: knickers and socks.
text: It’s noon. She’s just got up. She starts to fold her sheets
text: and blankets. A prisoner.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM.

dialog: Barbara’s.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: But all things considered we're coping
dialog: admirably. In fact, gold stars abundant!

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR/BEDROOM - SAME TIME
text: Sheba comes out the bathroom and wanders down the corridor

speaker_heading: BARBARA (V-O.)
dialog: There are usually tears - such big, salty
text: tears she cries - and fits of teenage tantrums
dialog: too.
text: Sheba puts on some make up, dark eye liner, red lips. She’s
text: bored out of her brain.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.O.)
dialog: In time she’ll recognize she’s just not the
dialog: mothering kind...
text: Sheba stops, spots another gold star on the carpet. She picks
text: it up and flicks it into the bin.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: And then Barbara will be there to comfort her;
dialog: nurse, beloved friend and wise counsel.
text: The bin is full of fag butts, evidence of a long night’s
text: work. Sheba sees another gold star amongst the detritus.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (V.0.)
dialog: I used to waddle through the world virtually
dialog: invisible but now I seem somehow to shine.
text: Sheba spots a scrap of crumpled paper ripped from a notebook -

scene_heading: INT. BARBARA’S BEDROOM
text: Sheba searches drawers, under the bed, in cupboards, turns
text: out the laundry basket - until finally...in the bottom of a
text: little drawer beneath the mirror she finds the journal.
text: She flicks through: Barbara’s black ink handwriting - mainly

text: mad, margin scrawlings.
text: The gold stars charting the various ups and downs...
speaker_heading: Ibo
text: A photo: Barbara and JENNIFER DODD in Paris, smiling at the

dialog: Beneath the photo Barbara has written, ‘Paris 2003 - before
dialog: the worm turned’.
text: On another page Sheba finds a Pizza Express receipt marked
dialog: ‘Ladies who lunch! !!’.
text: And there are numerous clippings from recent newspaper
dialog: reports on the scandal.

text: ornaments torn from shelves.
text: Sheba is sat on the edge of an armchair. Fully dressed now,
text: wearing her coat, her suitcase by her side.
text: She's savage with rage - clutching the journal. Her make up
text: disturbing, eyes black with mascara, lips a violent red.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: What you say, about me, about Richard. You’re
dialog: not fit to shine his shoes. And Ben and
dialog: Polly-..that I'd be better off without them?
text: Sheba rises. Slowly approaches. Barbara holds her ground.
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: Why did you do it? Because I didn’t help you
dialog: collect your CAT!
text: Sheba slaps her hard across the face. Barbara flinches but
text: doesn’t budge, accepting her punishment.
text: Sheba slaps her again. Barbara stands firm, taking it,
dialog: despite the pain. .
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Let it all out...
speaker_heading: SHEBA
dialog: You’ve cost me my family!
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh, take some responsibility! They’d have
