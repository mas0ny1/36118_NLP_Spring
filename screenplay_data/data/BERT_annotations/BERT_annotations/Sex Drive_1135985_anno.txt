scene_heading: INT. MASSIVE RAVE - NIGHT
text: Techno music thumps as we snake through a crowded party. All
text: we see are people and lights. Everyone is either dancing,
text: talking or making out. Arrive behind a petit brunette with a
text: body that has precipitated many a boner. MS. TASTY turns
text: revealing a sweet, stunning twenty-year-old smile.
speaker_heading: MS. TASTY
dialog: Ian! Hey, sweetie! (Strikes a
dialog: sexy pose) So? What do you think?
text: Reverse to show who she’s posing for, but IAN is silhouetted,
text: backlit by disco lights. He speaks with smug confidence.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Not bad. I’ve seen better, but you
dialog: make it work.
text: She’s not put off by the back-handed compliment. On the
text: contrary, it seems to make her try harder.
speaker_heading: MS. TASTY
dialog: Jerk. So when do I get to check
dialog: out your big, sexy bod? L-O-L!
text: Her face rotates unnaturally ninety degrees on it’s side and
text: winks ;) Pull back hard to reveal thousands, maybe millions
text: of people at this party. The heads become pixels on Ms.
text: Tasty’s MySpace page on a computer in:
scene_heading: INT. IAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The real Ian lies in bed with his laptop, wearing a Darth
text: Vader t-shirt, Chicago Cubs pajama bottoms and reading
text: glasses. He’s eighteen but could pass for sixteen. He's a
dialog: sweet kid with the kind of thoughtful, approachable face you
dialog: might seek when in need of directions.
text: Close on her words on the screen: “JERK. SO WHEN DO I GET TO
text: CHECK OUT YOUR BIG, SEXY BOD? L-O-L!”
text: Ian lets out a nervous giggle. He types his reply, “IT’S NOT
text: REALLY THAT SEXY.” He stops and deletes that.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: (whispering to himself)
dialog: God. Don’t be a dork. Act cool.
dialog: Be a dick. Just be a dick.
text: He retypes, “DAMN, UR SO PUSHY. I’LL UPLOAD MY PIC IN A SEC.”
scene_heading: MAIN TITLES OVER:
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: Ian opens a picture of himself in PhotoShop. He borrows some
text: facial hair from a photo of Brad Pitt and places it on his
text: own face. He opens a folder called “Family Pics,” then a
text: subfolder titled, “REX.” He opens a picture of a cocky tough
text: guy leaning against a shiny orange 1969 GTO Judge. Ian
text: places his own head on the tough guy’s body.
text: As he does this work, we get a look at the room, which is
text: divided by a line of electrical tape running down the wall
text: marked, "DYLAN'S SIDE - IAN KEEP OUT!!!" Ian's side is neat
text: and sparsely decorated with a few band posters and some Lord
text: of the Rings merch. The other side of the room is cluttered
text: and decorated with extreme sports and bikini girl posters.
text: Several motocross and snowboarding trophies are proudly
text: displayed. Ian’s brother DYLAN (14) sleeps in a twin bed.
text: His Tiger Beat face even looks confident while asleep. A
text: clock reads 12:21 a.m.
speaker_heading: END TITLES
text: Ian clicks “Upload Pic” and we return to the:
scene_heading: INT. MYSPACE CYBER RAVE
text: Now some of Ms. Tasty’s MySpace bio stats float in the air
dialog: next to her: "MsTasty, 5' 5" / Age:20 / Home: Knoxville, TN /
dialog: Here For: Friends / Occupation: College Student / Interests:
dialog: Cars, Bikes, Music, Horses, Football and Mad Partying!!!" Ian
text: materializes next to her, now with the cool facial hair and
text: leaning against the car. Before Tasty even turns to see him,
text: LANCE materializes out of thin air, landing between them.
text: Lance is eighteen, good looking, built and dressed cool.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Ian? Dude. What’s with this
dialog: picture!? Holy shit, that’s funny!
text: Next to Lance, FELICIA materializes. Also eighteen, she’s a
text: petit, pretty girl with her own unique, artsy look and a
text: definite edge on her attitude.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Oh my god, Ian. That’s hilarious!
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Yeah. Funny, right? Just a joke.
dialog: Can’t talk right now though.
text: Ian is antsy, trying to see past them to Tasty. Tasty
text: remains oblivious to this entire exchange.

speaker_heading: FELICIA

dialog: prep crap.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Your hot cousin?
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: She’s the Antichrist, Lance.
speaker_heading: IAN
text: She’s still hot.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Well, I NEED to get out.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: We can hang at my house. The whole
text: family is taking Dylan to his moto-
dialog: cross nationals this weekend.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Sweet! You rock.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Thanks. Now I gotta go.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Dude, you working tom--
text: Ian waves a hand at Lance and Felicia. They each disappear
text: with a click. Finally Ian can see Ms. Tasty again.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: So, Tasty. Feast your eyes, sugar
dialog: biscuit.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - IAN’S BEDROOM / MYSPACE CYBER RAVE
text: Back in reality, Ian slaps his own head.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Sugar biscuit? You idiot.
text: Back in cyberspace, Tasty looks over at Ian and his car.
speaker_heading: MS. TASTY
dialog: Nice. O.M.G. Your car is sick!

speaker_heading: MS. TASTY
dialog: (dirty smile)
dialog: Mmmm. I love sixty-nines.
text: Back in his bedroom, Ian is stunned. He stands and nervously
text: paces, muttering to himself. He takes off his glasses.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Whoa. Sixty-nines; she likes those.
dialog: Okay, don’t puss out. Be a dick
text: Back in cyberspace, Ian continues to act cool.
speaker_heading: IAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Whatever. I gotta blow. Coach's
dialog: got us running two-a-days. Peace.
text: Ian disappears - to Tasty’s great disappointment.
scene_heading: INT. IAN’S BEDROOM
text: Ian stares at her picture and her last line, “I LUV 69's.”
text: He checks that Dylan is sleeping. He grabs a roll of toilet
text: paper from under his bed. He reaches into his pajama pants.
speaker_heading: DYLAN (0.S.)
dialog: Are you spankin’ it over there!
text: Ian stops.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: No! I was just scratching my leg.
dialog: It’s itchy...this blanket.
scene_heading: INT. IAN’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Ian wanders groggily out of his room. He opens the bathroom
text: door but stops cold with the door open only three inches.
text: His eyes go like saucers - he’s now wide awake.
text: Ian’s POV through the door: A gorgeous, naked woman is bent
text: over and towelling off her hair. Ian watches with nervous
text: curiosity. She turns toward him but the towel covers her
text: face. As she rubs the towel on her head, her boobs jiggle.
text: Ian is in a trance until...
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Ian!?
text: Ian turns to see that his parents are standing at the end of
text: the hall and looking his way.

dialog: Were you just peeping on your
dialog: sister?
text: The girl screams and the bathroom door slams shut.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: No! I was just gonna use the...
text: His father raises an eyebrow as if to say, “Well, what about
text: that?” A wider shot of Ian reveals that he has pitched an
text: unmistakable tent in his pajama pants.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IAN'S FATHER
dialog: Alright! Family meeting!
scene_heading: INT. IAN’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Ian’s Father, STEPMOTHER and brother Dylan sit at the table.
text: Also at the table is REX, Ian's older brother from the photo.
text: He's a twenty-four-year-old big lug whose thinning hair is
text: highlighted and spiky. Next to him is JESSICA, the hot girl
text: from the shower. She’s about twenty and wearing a pink baby-
text: doll T printed with sorority symbols. She talks on her cell
text: as Ian arrives at the table.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: (into her phone)
dialog: No, I gotta go. My new stepbrother
dialog: was spying on me in the shower and
dialog: playing with himself or something.
dialog: ..-Yeah, I'll call you after.
text: Ian timidly sits. His father sends a stern look his way.
speaker_heading: IAN'S FATHER
dialog: Listen, mister--
speaker_heading: IAN'S STEPMOTHER
dialog: (interrupting sweetly)
dialog: Ian. You and your brothers have
dialog: made me feel so welcome in your
dialog: family. And now that Jessica is
dialog: home from Princeton, I hope you’1l
dialog: be able to see her as your sister.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: No. I do. I just--
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: You don’t look at your sister and
dialog: pop a stiffy, Ian. That is NOT
dialog: normal.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: IAN'S STEPMOTHER
dialog: Rex, please. Let’s just all do our
dialog: best to respect one another's
dialog: privacy. Okay, honey?
speaker_heading: IAN'S FATHER
dialog: Now apologize to Jessica.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Um....I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: IAN'S FATHER
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: I’m sorry for...seeing you naked.
speaker_heading: IAN'S FATHER
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Um...and getting a...um...
speaker_heading: IAN'S FATHER
dialog: That’s it. You’re grounded, bub.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: I gotta go. If you fags want a
dialog: ride, you better hustle up.
text: We track out the window and across the street to:
scene_heading: INT. FELICIA’S HOUSE
text: A modest but nice suburban home. Felicia is coming down the
text: stairs. She wears a black t-shirt that reads, “I’m begging
text: you to shut up.” She stops when she hears voices. She peers
text: around the corner into the dining room. Her MOTHER sits at
text: the kitchen table with AUNT CAROL. Standing on the other
text: side of the table is TIFFANY, a blonde Brittany Spears type
text: about Felicia’s age. Tiffany is arranging some Barbie & Ken
text: dolls in a make-believe wedding ceremony.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: I don’t know. Maybe just six
dialog: bridesmaids?
text: Tiffany removes a black-haired Barbie from the line-up. From
text: her perch, Felicia enthusiastically nods her agreement.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: AUNT CAROL
dialog: Sweetie, marriage is about family.
dialog: Felicia’s your cousin.

speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: (whispering to herself)
dialog: She’s right, I will. Listen to her.
dialog: She’s making some solid points.
speaker_heading: FELICIA’S MOTHER
dialog: Don’t worry, dear. I'’11 speak to
dialog: Felicia.
text: Felicia tip-toes down the steps and sneaks out the front
text: door. She nearly makes it out when her mother spots her.
speaker_heading: FELICIA’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Hon? Come say hi to your cousin
dialog: and your Aunt Carol.
text: Felicia hangs her head, sighs and goes back inside. We pull
text: away and cross the street again to the home next to Ian’s.
scene_heading: INT. LANCE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN
text: We find Lance at the breakfast table working on a bowl of
text: Count Chocula. LANCE’S FATHER enters, talking on his cell
text: phone. He’s dressed a little too cool for his age.
speaker_heading: LANCE’S FATHER
dialog: Judy! What do you want from me?
dialog: The boy’s eighteen now. These
dialog: aren’t my problems anymore. Hello?
text: He looks at the phone. Obviously she hung up. He grabs a
text: bowl, sits down and pours himself some cereal.
speaker_heading: LANCE'S FATHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Your mom’s still batshit crazy.
text: Lance shakes his head, eating and reading Maxim.
speaker_heading: LANCE'S FATHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, what, she never trash talks me?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Actually, she doesn’t. Ever.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: LANCE’S FATHER
dialog: Well, in any case, take my advice,
dialog: chief, never get married. Just an
dialog: endless parade of nonsense. And
dialog: for god's sake always wear a
dialog: rubber. Jesus H.
text: Lance walks out, taking the comment personally.
speaker_heading: LANCE’S FATHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, come on, pal, I didn’t mean it
dialog: that way!
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN ROAD - MORNING
dialog: Cue: “Let’s Get it Up” by AC/DC.
text: THE JUDGE (the shiny orange 69 Pontiac GTO from Ian’s photo)
text: now rumbles aggressively through the Chicago suburbs.
scene_heading: INT. THE JUDGE
text: Rex drives and sings loudly. Dylan rides shotgun. Ian sits
text: in back; he’s now dressed in a purple polo and visor,
text: embroidered with a “Sefior Donut” logo. Rex turns the radio
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Ian - question. And I want a
dialog: straight answer. You queer?
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: God damn it! I knew it!
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: I didn't say anything!
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Exactly. When someone asks if
dialog: you're a pole-smoker, you deny it
dialog: right off. No pause! No fartin'
dialog: around! Jesus, Ian!
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Rex, I'm not gay.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: You're eighteen and you ain't even

speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: I don’t think that’s really how it
dialog: happens. But anyway, I’m not gay.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Well, Dad thinks you’re are.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: You're breaking the old man's
dialog: heart.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Look, there’s this girl I've been
dialog: kinda getting to know on MySpace.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: MySpace? Oh, for fuck’s sake!
dialog: Don't you watch Dateline? She's
dialog: probably a guy, Ian! Some fat old
dialog: dude who wants to pound you up the
dialog: tailpipe!
scene_heading: EXT. MALL PARKING LOT
text: The Judge stops and Ian climbs out.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Have fun at work. Try not to come
dialog: home any gayer than you are now.
scene_heading: INT. MALL FOOD COURT - SENOR DONUT
text: RON is prepping the donut shop for another day. He's a
text: middle-aged man in a tight button-up manager’s shirt that
text: shows off his gut. Ian enters the store.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Ian! So good of you to bless me
dialog: with your presence. Gee, I hope
dialog: I’m not putting you out.
speaker_heading: IAN

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Oh-three. Oh-three, huh? Yeah.
dialog: That's not gonna cut the cheese
dialog: around here, captain. At Sefior
dialog: Donut we plan to be ten minutes
dialog: early. That way if we miss it by
dialog: an oh three, we’re still early by
dialog: an oh-six. Comprendé?
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Right. Sorry.
text: Ian puts on an apron and begins prepping the counter. Cue
dialog: “Got You Where I Want You” by the Flys as several lovely
text: female mall employees arrive and walk by in slow motion. Ian
text: sneaks longing looks at each of them. Several quick close up
text: shots of hair, smiles, exposed thongs and the impressions of
text: bras and hard nipples through tight shirts.
text: Finally a cute, detached girl about Ian's age shows up
text: wearing the same Sefior Donut uniform and looking tired. Ian
text: gives her a friendly smile. She doesn’t return the favor.
speaker_heading: IAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Becca.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Hey. Hey, Ron. Sorry I’m late.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: No worries, girlfriend.
text: Ian gives Ron a “what the fuck?” look.
speaker_heading: RON (CONT'D)
dialog: (lascivious)
dialog: Looks like you had a long, nasty
dialog: night. Ron and Ian want the four-
dialog: one-uno.
speaker_heading: BECCA

speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: (hugging him)
dialog: Oh, Ian. Come on. You’d so be my
dialog: hero. I’d love you so, so much.
scene_heading: INT. MALL FOOD COURT - DAY
text: A giant foam donut walks through the food court, handing out
text: coupons. Sefior Donut wears a small sombrero, black tights
text: and a purple cape. TIan’s right arm sticks out of the suit.
text: The left arm is fake as Ian’s real left arm is kept inside
dialog: the suit to operate the mouth. (Like the Big Bird suit.) He
text: tries to hand out coupons but he’s a soft, timid sell.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Hi. Would you like a coupon for
dialog: six free-- No? Okay, cool. Sorry.
text: Ian turns to find Ron in his way, arms folded.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Hmmm. You don’t sound like Sefior
dialog: Donut. You sound more like Mr.-I-
dialog: don‘ t-take-pride-in-my-job-because-
dialog: I‘m-a-spoiled-suburban-kid-who’s-
dialog: had-everything-handed-to-me-Donut.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Ron, come on. I suck at doing the

speaker_heading: IAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Hola. Theees eeez a coupon for
dialog: seeex free donuts. Es Mui Bueno!
text: The woman stares back uncomfortably and then looks to her
text: left. Ian turns to see what she’s looking at. A Mexican
text: family is standing nearby and glaring at Ian.
speaker_heading: IAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (normal voice)
dialog: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean any...

scene_heading: INT. MALL DRESS SHOP
text: Felicia steps out of a fitting room, wearing a poofy yellow
text: dress with a huge bow. She looks miserable. Tiffany
text: circles, nodding her approval.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: Oh, my, god. That is sooo cute on
dialog: you. You could be hot if you quit
dialog: dressing like so... agro. Now that
dialog: you’re eighteen you should totally
dialog: be thinking about getting those
dialog: boobs done too. You know?
text: Tiff gestures to her own fake boobs, then turns away to flip
text: through a rack of dresses. Felicia mimes plunging a knife
text: into Tiff’s back over and over. Tiff turns to look at
text: Felicia, who stops killing her and smiles back innocently.
speaker_heading: TIFFANY (CONT’D)
dialog: You know?
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Yeah. Boobs. Good. Made a note.
text: Felicia notices Sefior Donut out in the mall, going up the
text: escalator. He’s surrounded by a group of white ten-year-old
text: gang-banger-wannabes. They push Ian and he falls sideways,
text: rolling down to the bottom and out entrance. The kids follow
dialog: him down.
scene_heading: INT. MALL
text: Felicia jogs from the shop, holding her dress off the ground.
text: As she arrives, the kids are stomping Ian like a narc.
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: Aright, piss off, mallrats.
text: They stop. Their leader steps to Felicia with a precocious
text: swagger. He’s a foot shorter than she.
speaker_heading: MALLRAT
dialog: Yo, banana-ass-lookin’ bitch.
dialog: Y'all ain’t gonna roll up on our
dialog: shit and start bustin’ out to-dos.

text: flapping as he speaks.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Ian, why you gotta do that - work
dialog: the mouth when you talk to us?
speaker_heading: FELICIA
dialog: (sarcastic)

speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: (not working the mouth)
dialog: Sorry. Habit. Here, give me a

speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: Becca. Not that great.
speaker_heading: FELICIA

dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FELICIA

speaker_heading: CHURCH DAD

text: Rex pitches a tantrum for the ages. He violently shakes the
text: garage door, tearing it off it’s rails. It lowers enough for
text: him to start kicking it. He breaks it. He reaches inside
text: and pulls out Ian’s bike and starts slamming it against the
text: driveway. Once out of steam, he stomps down the driveway and
text: across the street.
text: As he crosses, he holds up a “halt” hand. Offscreen we hear
text: a car go into a shrieking skid. Rex is unfazed as he marches
text: up Felicia’s driveway. The car rolls by behind him.
text: Rex arrives on Felicia’s porch. He rings the bell and
text: seethes and swears under his breath while he waits.
text: Felicia’s mother opens the door. His face instantly
text: transitions to sweet and neighborly. She smiles back.
speaker_heading: FELICIA’S MOTHER

speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Good, good. Listen, Mrs. Alpine,

speaker_heading: FELICIA’S MOTHER

speaker_heading: REX
dialog: You bet it is. Thanks much, Mrs. A.
speaker_heading: FELICIA’S MOTHER
dialog: Oh, not at all. My pleasure. You
dialog: have a good day, now.
text: The second the door closes, Rex returns to fury. He turns
text: and stomps back toward his house. In the wide shot we see a
text: neighbor watering his yard next door.
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR
dialog: Hey, Knievel! What’s say you get
dialog: your bike out of the freakin’ road!
text: Rex doesn’t break stride; he just turns hard left,
text: redirecting right at the neighbor. (Think Terminator 2) The

speaker_heading: DR. JASPER (CONT’D)
dialog: Now, what are we doing today?
text: Felicia removes her hand from her face and opens up. Doctor
text: Jasper pushes her lower teeth down with the side of his index
