scene_heading: EXT. MARIGOLD PATH - DUSK
text: A path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly
text: arranged in a humble cemetery. An old woman lights a candle
text: as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward...
speaker_heading: CARD: DISNEY PRESENTS
scene_heading: CARD: A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM
text: The smoke lifts up toward lines of papel picado ­- cut paper
text: banners -- that sway gently in the breeze.
speaker_heading: PAPEL PICADO CARD: "COCO"
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: Sometimes I think I'm cursed...
dialog: 'cause of something that happened
dialog: before I was even born.
text: A story begins to play out on the papel picado.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: See, a long time ago there was this
dialog: family.
text: The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a
text: father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: The papá, he was a musician.
text: The papá plays guitar while the mother dances with her
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: He and his family would sing, and
dialog: dance, and count their blessings...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But he also had a dream... to play
dialog: for the world.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And one day he left with his
dialog: guitar... and never returned.
text: The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In
text: another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching
text: her papá leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her
dialog: mamá, hardened.
text: She shuts the door.
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: And the mamá...? She didn't have
dialog: time to cry over that walkaway
dialog: musician!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: After banishing all music from her
dialog: life...
text: The woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and
dialog: records.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: She found a way to provide for her
dialog: daughter...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She rolled up her sleeves and she
dialog: learned to make shoes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She could have made candy!
text: Amongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up
text: piñata which bursts with candy...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: Or fireworks!
text: Fireworks go off in the background...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!
text: Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst
dialog: other linens...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: But no... she chose shoes...
text: On the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: Then she taught her daughter to
dialog: make shoes. And later, she taught
dialog: her son-in-law.
text: She introduces a suitor to the family business.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: Then her grandkids got roped in.
dialog: As her family grew, so did the
dialog: business.
text: In the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in
text: the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family!
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: Music had torn her family apart,
dialog: but shoes held them all together.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You see, that woman was my great-
dialog: great grandmother, Mamá Imelda.
dialog: TILT DOWN from the papel picado to the
scene_heading: OFRENDA ROOM - DAY
text: where a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar. The
text: photo features MAMÁ IMELDA -- serious, formidable. She holds
text: a baby on her lap. Her husband stands beside her, but his
text: face has been torn away.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: She died WAY before I was born.
dialog: But my family still tells her story
dialog: every year on Día de los Muertos --
dialog: the Day of the Dead...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And her little girl?
text: Fade from the face of the little girl to present day MAMÁ
text: COCO (97), a living raisin, convalescing in a wicker
dialog: wheelchair.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: She's my great grandmother, Mamá
dialog: Coco.
text: A boy (12) walks into frame and kisses her on the cheek.
dialog: This is our narrator, MIGUEL.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Holá, Mamá Coco.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO
dialog: How are you, Julio?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: Actually, my name is Miguel. Mamá
dialog: Coco has trouble remembering
dialog: things... But it's good to talk to
dialog: her anyway. So I tell her pretty
dialog: much everything.
dialog: QUICK CUTS of Miguel with Mamá Coco:
dialog: 4.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I used to run like this...
text: Miguel pumps his arms with his hands in fists. Then he
text: switches to flat palms.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: But now I run like this which is
dialog: way faster!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MAMÁ COCO'S ROOM
text: Miguel, in a luchador mask, climbs onto the bed, arms raised.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DINING AREA
text: Miguel leans toward Mamá Coco at the dinner table.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I have a dimple on this side, but
dialog: not on this side. Dimple. No
dialog: dimple. Dimple. No dimple--
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Miguel! Eat your food.
text: Miguel's ABUELITA (70s) runs the table like a ship captain.
text: She gives Mamá Coco a kiss on the head.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: My Abuelita? She's Mamá Coco's
dialog: daughter.
text: Abuelita piles extra tamales on Miguel's plate.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Aw, you're a twig, mijo. Have some
dialog: more.
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No, gracias.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: I asked if you would like more
dialog: tamales.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: S-sí?
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: That's what I THOUGHT you said.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: Abuelita runs our house just like
dialog: Mamá Imelda did.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OFRENDA ROOM - DAY
text: Abuelita adjusts the photo of her beloved Mamá Imelda. Then
text: she perks her ear at a hooting sound.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Miguel idly blows into a glass soda bottle. Abuelita takes
dialog: the bottle away.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: No music!
scene_heading: INT. MAMÁ COCO'S ROOM - DAY
text: Miguel listens as a truck drives by the window, blaring radio
text: tunes. Abuelita angrily slams the window shut.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: No music!!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EVENING
text: A trio of gentlemen serenade each other as they stroll by the
dialog: family compound.
speaker_heading: MUSICIANS

speaker_heading: AUNQUE LA VIDA--
dialog: 6.
text: Abuelita bursts out of the gate and chases them away.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: NO MUSIC!!!
text: Terrified, the musicians stumble as they run away.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)
dialog: I think we're the only family in
dialog: México who hates music...
scene_heading: INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP - DAY
text: We see the Rivera family tinkering in the shoe shop, no music
text: to be heard. Miguel jogs past them.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: And my family's fine with that...
text: He grabs his shine box, and heads out of the shoe shop.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: But me?
speaker_heading: MAMÁ
dialog: Be back by lunch, mijo!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Love you, Mamá!
text: Once outside, Miguel makes his way through the small town of
scene_heading: SANTA CECILIA - MORNING
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: I am NOT like the rest of my
dialog: family...
text: He passes a woman sweeping a stoop.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hola, Miguel!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Hola!
text: He passes a band of musicians playing a tune. Miguel joins
text: with some air guitar and the further down the street he goes,
text: the more instruments and sounds layer in. The bells of the
text: church chime in harmony, a radio blares a cumbia rhythm.
dialog: 7.
text: Running past a food stand, Miguel grabs a roll of pan dulce
text: and tosses the vendor a coin.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Muchas gracias!
speaker_heading: STREET VENDOR
dialog: De nada, Miguel!
text: As Miguel passes all these scenes, the music synthesizes and
text: he can't help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes.
text: The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a
text: different tone like a marimba. Miguel finishes with a SMACK
text: on a trash can, out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless
text: Xolo dog. The dog, DANTE, barks and jumps up to lick Miguel,
dialog: who laughs.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Hey, hey! Dante!
text: Miguel holds the pan dulce over Dante's head.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Sit. Down. Roll over. Shake.
dialog: Fist bump.
text: Dante obeys to the best of his ability.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Good boy, Dante!
text: Miguel tosses the pan dulce to his furless friend who topples
text: back into the trash can.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: MARIACHI PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER
text: Miguel rounds the corner toward the town square. Vendors
text: sell sugar skulls and marigolds, and musicians fill the
text: square with music.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)
dialog: I know I'm not supposed to love
dialog: music -- but it's not my fault!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's his: Ernesto de la Cruz...
text: Miguel approaches a statue of a handsome mariachi at the
dialog: heart of the plaza.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)
dialog: ...The greatest musician of all
dialog: time.
text: A tour group and their TOUR GUIDE are gathered around the
text: base of the statue.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: And right here, in this very plaza,
dialog: the young Ernesto de la Cruz took
dialog: his first steps toward becoming the
dialog: most beloved singer in Mexican
dialog: history!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLIPS of de la Cruz in his hay day: playing as a young man in
text: the plaza, serenading bystanders in a train car...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: He started out a total nobody from
dialog: Santa Cecilia, like me. But when
dialog: he played music, he made people
text: fall in love with him.
text: MORE CLIPS from de la Cruz's films. He leaps from a tree
text: branch onto a galloping horse. He plays his signature skull
text: guitar with flourish and flair.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: He starred in movies. He had the
dialog: coolest guitar... He could fly!
text: A CLIP features de la Cruz dressed as a hovering priest, held
text: up by strings, in front of a cycling sky flat.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: And he wrote the best songs! But
dialog: my all-time favorite? It's--
text: A CLIP of de la Cruz performing in a fancy nightclub.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: (singing)
speaker_heading: REMEMBER ME
dialog: THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE
speaker_heading: REMEMBER ME
dialog: DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY
dialog: FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY
dialog: I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART
dialog: I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU
dialog: EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART
speaker_heading: REMEMBER ME
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D)
dialog: THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR
speaker_heading: REMEMBER ME
dialog: EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD GUITAR
dialog: KNOW THAT I'M WITH YOU THE ONLY WAY
dialog: THAT I CAN BE...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: He lived the kind of life you dream
dialog: about... Until 1942...
text: As the audience swoons over de la Cruz, an absent-minded
text: stagehand leans on a lever. Ropes and pulleys go flying.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN
speaker_heading: REMEMBER ME!
text: De la Cruz is subsequently crushed by a giant bell.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: When he was crushed by a giant
dialog: bell.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MARIACHI PLAZA - DAY
text: Miguel gazes up at the statue of de la Cruz in awe.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O)
dialog: I wanna be just like him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Miguel weaves up to de la Cruz's mausoleum and peeks in the
text: window. He catches a glimpse of de la Cruz's signature skull
dialog: guitar.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (V.O.)
dialog: Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and
dialog: I get this feeling... like we're
dialog: connected somehow. Like, if HE
dialog: could play music, maybe someday I
dialog: could too...
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: EXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - DAY
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: ...If it wasn't for my family.
speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Ay, ay, ay, muchacho.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI
dialog: I asked for a shoe shine, not your
dialog: life story.
text: Miguel comes out of his reverie and looks up at the PLAZA
text: MARIACHI whose shoes he is shining.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Oh, yeah, sorry.
text: He goes back to scrubbing the man's shoe. As Miguel shines,
text: the mariachi plucks his guitar idly.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I just can't really talk about any
dialog: of this at home so...
speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI
dialog: Look, if I were you I'd march right
dialog: up to my family and say, "Hey! I'm
dialog: a musician. Deal with it!"
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I could never say that...
speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI
dialog: You ARE a musician, no?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I don't know. I mean... I only
dialog: really play for myself--
speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI
dialog: Did de la Cruz become the world's
dialog: best musician by hiding his sweet,
dialog: sweet skills? No! He walked out
dialog: onto that plaza and he played out
dialog: loud!
dialog: 11.
text: The mariachi gets an idea. He points to the gazebo where
text: organizers are setting up for a show. They unfurl a canvas
text: poster which reads "TALENT SHOW."
speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah, mira, mira! They're setting up
dialog: for tonight. The music competition
dialog: for Día de Muertos. You wanna be
dialog: like your hero? You should sign
dialog: up!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Uh-uh, my family would freak!
speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI
dialog: Look, if you're too scared, then,
dialog: well... have fun making shoes.
dialog: Miguel considers this.
speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon. What did de la Cruz always
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: ...Seize your moment?
text: The mariachi appraises Miguel, then offers his guitar.
speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI
dialog: Show me what you got, muchacho.
dialog: I'll be your first audience.
text: Miguel's brows rise, surprised. He reaches to take the
text: instrument, regarding it as if holding a holy relic.
text: Miguel spreads his fingers across the strings anticipating
dialog: his chord and...
speaker_heading: ABUELITA (O.S.)
speaker_heading: MIGUEL!
text: Startled, Miguel impulsively throws the guitar back onto the
text: mariachi's lap. He turns to see Abuelita marching toward
text: him. Miguel's TÍO BERTO (40s) and PRIMA ROSA (16), follow
dialog: with supplies from the market.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Abuelita!
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: What are you doing here?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Um...uh...
text: Miguel quickly packs away his shine rag and polishes.
text: Abuelita barrels up to the mariachi.
text: She hits his hat with her shoe and waves him away.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: You leave my grandson alone!
speaker_heading: PLAZA MARIACHI
dialog: Doña, please -- I was just getting
dialog: a shine!
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: I know your tricks, mariachi!
dialog: (to Miguel)
dialog: What did he say to you?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: He was just showing me his
dialog: guitar...
text: Gasps from the family.
speaker_heading: TÍO BERTO
dialog: Shame on you!
text: Abuelita lords over the mariachi, shoe aimed directly between
dialog: his eyes.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: My grandson is a sweet little
dialog: angelito querido cielito -- he
dialog: wants no part of your music,
dialog: mariachi! You keep away from him!
text: The mariachi scrambles away, snatching his hat off the
text: ground before he goes. Abuelita hugs Miguel protectively to
dialog: her bosom.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Ay, pobrecito! Estás bien, mijo?
text: She peppers him with kisses then releases him from the
text: embrace. He gasps for air.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: (distressed)
dialog: You know better than to be here in
dialog: this place! You will come home.
dialog: Now.
dialog: 13.
text: Abuelita turns toward home. Miguel sighs and gathers his
text: shine box. Then, seeing a flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW",
text: he can't help but pocket it. He follows Abuelita.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: Miguel catches up to his family.
speaker_heading: TÍO BERTO
dialog: How many times have we told you --
dialog: that plaza is crawling with
dialog: mariachis!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Yes, Tío Berto.
text: Dante ambles up to Miguel, sniffing and whining for a treat.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No, no, no!
text: Abuelita shoos him away.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Go away, you! Go!
text: Dante darts off, scared.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: It's just Dante...
text: Abuelita throws her shoe at the dog.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Never name a street dog. They'll
dialog: follow you forever.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now, go get my shoe.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP
text: The Rivera workshop is abuzz with family making shoes.
text: WHOMP! Miguel is plopped onto a stool, ready for a lecture.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: I found your son in Mariachi Plaza!
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Miguel...
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ
dialog: You know how Abuelita feels about
dialog: the plaza.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I was just shining shoes!
speaker_heading: TÍO BERTO
dialog: A musician's shoes!
text: Gasps from the family. PRIMO ABEL (19) is so shocked he
text: loses his grip on the shoe he is polishing, which zips away
text: from the polisher and lodges itself in the roof.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: But the plaza's where all the foot
dialog: traffic is.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: If Abuelita says no more plaza,
dialog: then no more plaza.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: (blurting)
dialog: But what about tonight?
speaker_heading: PAPÁ FRANCO
dialog: What's tonight?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Well they're having this talent
dialog: show-
text: Abuelita perks her ear, suspicious. Miguel squirms, deciding
dialog: whether to go on.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: And I thought I might...
text: Mamá looks at Miguel, curious.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ
dialog: ...Sign up?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Well, maybe?
speaker_heading: PRIMA ROSA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You have to have talent to be in a
dialog: talent show.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: PRIMO ABEL
dialog: What are YOU going to do, shine
dialog: shoes?
text: The shoe from the ceiling falls back down on Abel's head.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: It's Día de los Muertos -- no one's
dialog: going anywhere. Tonight is about
dialog: family.
text: She deposits a pile of marigolds in Miguel's arms.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Ofrenda room. Vámonos.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OFRENDA ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Miguel follows his Abuelita to the family ofrenda, holding
text: the pile of flowers as she arranges them on the altar.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Don't give me that look. Día de
dialog: los Muertos is the one night of the
dialog: year our ancestors can come visit
dialog: us.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We've put their photos on the
dialog: ofrenda so their spirits can cross
dialog: over. That is very important! If
dialog: we don't put them up, they can't
dialog: come!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We made all this food -- set out
dialog: the things they loved in life,
dialog: mijo. All this work to bring the
dialog: family together. I don't want you
text: sneaking off to who-knows-where.
text: She looks up to find Miguel sneaking away.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I thought we were done...
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Ay, Dios mío... Being part of this
dialog: family means being HERE for this
dialog: family... I don't want to see you
dialog: end up like--
text: Abuelita looks up to the photo of the faceless musician.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Like Mamá Coco's papá?
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Never mention that man! He's
dialog: better off forgotten.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: But you're the one who--
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Ta, ta, ta-tch!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I was just--
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Tch-tch!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL

speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Tch!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL

speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO
dialog: Papá?
text: They look to find Mamá Coco agitated.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ABUELITA

speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO
dialog: Papá is coming home?
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: No Mamá. It's okay, I'm here.
text: Mamá Coco looks up at Abuelita.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO
dialog: Who are you?
text: Sadness rises in Abuelita; she swallows it down.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Rest, Mamá.
text: Abuelita returns to the ofrenda.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm hard on you because I care,
dialog: Miguel.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Miguel... Miguel?
text: She looks around the room. Miguel is nowhere to be found.
text: Abuelita steps up to the ofrenda.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA (CONT'D)
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: What are we going to do with that
dialog: boy...?
text: She looks to the photo of Mamá Imelda. Abuelita's eyes
text: brighten with an idea.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're right. That's just what he
dialog: needs!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET
text: Tío Berto unloads rolls of leather from a truckbed. Nearby,
text: Dante sleeps under the shade of a tree. He startles awake by
text: a faint TWANGING. The dog scrambles up to the roof.
text: He reaches a shoe sign advertising the Rivera Family business
text: and lifts it up.
scene_heading: INT. ROOFTOP HIDEOUT
text: Dante pokes his head in. Miguel turns and gasps.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon,
dialog: Dante. Hurry up.
text: Dante wriggles into the hideout. Miguel is huddled over
text: something. The dog peeks around his shoulder.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're gonna get me in trouble,
dialog: boy. Someone could hear me!
text: Miguel reveals a makeshift guitar, cobbled together from a
text: beat up old soundboard and random other items.
text: He takes a china marker and sketches a nose on what appears
text: to be his own version of a skull guitar head.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I wish someone wanted to hear me...
text: Miguel tunes the guitar.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Other than you...
text: Dante gives Miguel a big sloppy lick. Miguel gives a grossed-
text: out chuckle. He lifts his guitar and strums.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Perfecto!
text: He crawls to the far side of the attic where he's built his
dialog: own ofrenda to Ernesto de la Cruz. Posters, candles, and
text: songbooks are arranged with care. Miguel lights the candles
text: with reverence, illuminating an album cover of de la Cruz
text: holding his skull guitar.
text: Miguel compares the head of his guitar to the album cover.
text: Then he imitates de la Cruz's pose and smile.
text: He switches on a beat up old TV and pushes a tape into the
text: VCR, "Best of de la Cruz" scrawled on the spine.
text: A montage of the greatest moments from de la Cruz's films
dialog: plays out.
text: A clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: I have to sing. I have to play.
dialog: The music, it's -- it's not just in
dialog: me. It is me.
dialog: 19.
text: Miguel strums his guitar as de la Cruz imparts his wisdom.
text: More clips run in the background as Miguel plays:
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: When life gets me down, I play my
dialog: guitar.
text: In a clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: The rest of the world may follow
dialog: the rules, but I must follow my
dialog: heart!
text: De la Cruz kisses a woman passionately. Miguel cringes.
text: Another clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: You know that feeling? Like
dialog: there's a song in the air and it's
dialog: playing just for you...
text: As Miguel watches de la Cruz play guitar in the video, he
text: repeats the melody on his own guitar.

speaker_heading: I NEVER KNEW I COULD
scene_heading: WANT SOMETHING SO MUCH
dialog: BUT IT'S TRUE...
dialog: As a good-natured priest in "NUESTRA IGLESIA:"
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: You must have faith, sister.
speaker_heading: NUN (FILM CLIP)
dialog: Oh but Padre, he will never listen.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: He will listen... to MUSIC!
dialog: (singing)
speaker_heading: ONLY A SONG
speaker_heading: ONLY A SONG
text: HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE A HEART...
text: Miguel loses himself in the music.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: Never underestimate the power of
dialog: music...
text: Miguel's tune intertwines with the melodies on the TV set.
text: The clip jumps forward:
speaker_heading: LOLA (FILM CLIP)
dialog: But my father, he will never give
dialog: his permission.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: I am done asking permission. When
dialog: you see your moment you mustn't let
dialog: it pass you by, you must seize it!
text: The tape ends with an interview clip.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER (FILM CLIP)
dialog: Señor de la Cruz, what did it take
dialog: for you to seize your moment?
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: I had to have faith in my dream.
dialog: No one was going to hand it to me.
dialog: It was up to me to reach for that
dialog: dream, grab it tight, and make it
dialog: come true.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: ...and make it come true.
text: The tape ends. The words sink into Miguel. He reaches for
text: the flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW."
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No more hiding, Dante. I gotta
dialog: seize my moment!
text: Dante wags his tail, panting happily.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if
dialog: it kills me!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERA COMPOUND - SUNSET
text: Children run by with sparklers as Abuelita opens the doors to
dialog: the family compound.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Día de los Muertos has begun!
text: In the courtyard, two TODDLER COUSINS haphazardly scatter
text: marigold petals from their baskets.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ
dialog: No, no, no, no, no.
text: Mamá corrects them, creating a path from the ofrenda room to
text: the front gate.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ (CONT'D)
dialog: We have to make a clear path. The
dialog: petals guide our ancestors home. We
dialog: don't want their spirits to get
dialog: lost. We want them to come, and
dialog: enjoy all the food and drinks on
dialog: the ofrenda, sí?
text: As Mamá teaches, Miguel and Dante sneak across the roof and
text: drop to the sidewalk outside the compound, Miguel clutching
dialog: his guitar.
text: Suddenly Tío Berto and Papá round the corner carrying a small
dialog: table from storage.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: Mamá, where should we put this
dialog: table?
text: Miguel and Dante back up to avoid the adults, only to find
text: Abuelita sweeping the sidewalk behind them! Miguel and Dante
text: jump into the back into the Rivera courtyard before she sees
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
text: In the courtyard, mijos.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: You want it down by the kitchen?
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
text: Sí. Next to the other one.
scene_heading: INT. OFRENDA ROOM
text: Miguel backs out of the courtyard and into the family ofrenda
text: room. Nearly cornered, he ushers Dante past a sleeping Mamá
text: Coco. He stashes the dog and the guitar under the ofrenda
dialog: table.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Get under, get under!
speaker_heading: ABUELITA (O.S.)
dialog: Miguel!
text: Miguel straightens up to notice the doorway of the ofrenda
text: room darkened by three figures.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Nothing!
text: His Abuelita and parents stare straight at him. A pit grows
text: in his stomach; he's been caught.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Mamá -- Papá, I--
text: Papá lifts his finger to silence his son.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: Miguel...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Your Abuelita had the most
dialog: wonderful idea!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We've all decided -- it's time you
dialog: joined us in the workshop!
text: Abuelita hands Papá a leather apron, which he hangs over
text: Miguel's shoulders.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: No more shining shoes -- you will
dialog: be making them! Every day after
dialog: school!
text: Abuelita shuffles toward Miguel squealing. She squeezes his
text: cheeks, full of pride.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on
dialog: the family tradition! And on Día
dialog: de los Muertos! Your ancestors
dialog: will be so proud!
text: She gestures to the shoes adorning the ofrenda.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll craft huaraches just like
dialog: your Tía Victoria.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: And wingtips, like your Papá Julio--
text: Miguel crosses away from the ofrenda.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: But what if I'm no good at making
dialog: shoes?
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: Ah, Migue... You have your family
dialog: here to guide you...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You are a Rivera. And a Rivera
dialog: is...?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: ...A shoemaker. Through and
dialog: through.
text: Papá swells.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: That's my boy!
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Berto, break out the good stuff, I
dialog: wanna make a toast!
text: Papá heads out of the room, Mamá follows. Last is Abuelita,
text: who smothers Miguel with tons of kisses as she leaves.
text: With the family gone, Miguel deflates.
text: Suddenly, a noise comes from the ofrenda. Miguel turns to
text: find Dante on the bottom tier, licking a plate of mole to his
dialog: heart's content. Miguel is horrified!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Dante! No, Dante, stop!
text: Miguel pulls the dog away from the ofrenda, but the table
text: shakes. The frame with Mamá Imelda's photo sways back and
text: forth, then topples to the ground with a sickening crack.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no, no, no, no! No...
text: Miguel picks up the old photo of Mamá Imelda, which unfolds
dialog: to reveal another portion, hidden all these years;
dialog: 24.
text: the man with no face is revealed to be holding a familiar
text: skull-headed guitar.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: De la Cruz's guitar...?
speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO
dialog: Papá?
text: Miguel turns, startled. Mamá Coco points a crooked finger at
text: the picture in his hand.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO (CONT'D)
dialog: Papá?
text: Miguel's eyes go wide as the connection dawns on him. Could
dialog: it possibly be true?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Mamá Coco, is your papá... Ernesto
dialog: de la Cruz?
speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO
dialog: Papá! Papá!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOFTOP HIDEOUT
text: Miguel goes to his secret ofrenda, to the record album of
text: Ernesto de la Cruz. He compares the guitar in the family
text: photo with the guitar on the sleeve. An exact match!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Ha, ha!
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP
text: Miguel runs to the edge of the roof, overlooking the
text: courtyard, photo in one hand, guitar in the other.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Papá! Papá!
text: His parents stop, looking up at Miguel.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's him! I know who my great-
dialog: great grandfather was!
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ
dialog: Miguel! Get down from there!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Mamá Coco's father was Ernesto de
dialog: la Cruz!
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: Miguel whips off his shoemaker's apron, striking a pose with
dialog: the guitar.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I'm gonna be a musician!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING
text: Miguel's guitar is cast at his feet, along with his de la
text: Cruz albums. The whole family encircles the boy.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: What is all this? You keep secrets
dialog: from your own family?
speaker_heading: TÍO BERTO
dialog: It's all that time he spends in the
dialog: plaza...
speaker_heading: TÍA GLORIA
dialog: ...Fills his head with crazy
dialog: fantasies!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: It's not a fantasy!
text: Miguel hands Papá the photo and points to the skull guitar.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!
dialog: The greatest musician of all time!
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: We've never known anything about
dialog: this man. But whoever he was, he
dialog: still abandoned his family. This
dialog: is no future for my son.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: But Papá, you said my family would
dialog: guide me! Well de la Cruz IS my
dialog: family! I'm supposed to play
dialog: music!
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Never! That man's music was a
dialog: curse! I will not allow it!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: If you would just let--
speaker_heading: MAMÁ
dialog: (warning)
dialog: Miguel--
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: You will listen to your family. No
dialog: more music.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Just listen to me play--
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: End of argument.
text: Miguel lifts his guitar to play when Abuelita snatches the
text: instrument away. She points to the man in the photo.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: You want to end up like that man?
dialog: Forgotten? Left off your family's
dialog: ofrenda?!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I don't care if I'm on some stupid
dialog: ofrenda!
text: Gasps from the family. Abuelita's brow hardens. She lifts
text: the guitar in the air.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: Mamá...
dialog: Abuelita smashes it to bits!
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
text: There. No guitar, no music.
dialog: (softening)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Come. You'll feel better after you
dialog: eat with your family.
text: She reaches out to comfort Miguel, but he is hurt beyond
dialog: repair.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I don't wanna be in this family!
text: He snatches the photo from Papá and bolts out of the
dialog: hacienda.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: Miguel! MIGUEL!
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET
text: Miguel bursts out of the compound, desperate to get away.
text: Dante, nose buried in a trash bag, hears Miguel and chases
text: after him. Miguel runs past a poster for the plaza "TALENT
dialog: SHOW."
scene_heading: EXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - EVENING
text: Miguel approaches a STAGE MANAGER in the gazebo.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I wanna play in the plaza. Like de
dialog: la Cruz! Can I still sign-up?
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: You got an instrument?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No... But if I can borrow a guitar--
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: Musicians gotta bring their own
dialog: instruments...
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: You find a guitar, kid, I'll put
dialog: you on the list.
text: Miguel looks distraught.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER:
text: Miguel approaches any musician he can find.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Excuse me, can I borrow your
dialog: guitar?
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN #1
dialog: Sorry, muchacho.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You guys have a spare guitar?
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN #2
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I need a guitar, just for a little
dialog: bit--
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN #3
dialog: Get outta here, kid!
text: Disheartened, Miguel walks away. He finds himself facing the
dialog: statue of de la Cruz.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Great-great grandfather... What am
dialog: I supposed to do?
text: No answer. Miguel's gaze falls on a plaque at the base of
text: the statue that reads "Seize Your Moment!" Miguel looks at
text: the photo in his hand. He moves his thumb to reveal the
text: skull head guitar. Then, a firework illuminates the skull
text: head guitar that the statue holds. Miguel gets an idea.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER
text: A sea of candles and flowers, families gathered at graves.
text: Miguel sneaks through the cemetery unnoticed, slipping from
text: one shadow to the next.
text: Dante suddenly catches up to Miguel. He barks excitedly.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop!
dialog: Cállate! Shhh!
text: Miguel swipes a chicken leg off a neighboring grave, and
text: chucks it. Dante bounds after the food.
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM
text: Miguel slinks around the side of the tomb. He looks in one
dialog: of the windows.
text: Inside, the famous guitar hangs above the crypt. Fireworks
text: pop; bursts of light glint off the instrument. It seems to
text: beckon him. He tries the window but it's locked.
text: More fireworks shoot into the sky.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I'm sorry...
text: Timing to the explosions, Miguel throws his shoulder into the
text: rusted-shut window pane and forces it open with a scraping
text: KRRRR-LANK! He slinks inside the tomb.
scene_heading: INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM
text: Miguel drops down to the mausoleum floor. The noise from
text: outside is muffled. He climbs onto the crypt, slightly
text: moving the lid. He stifles a gasp.
text: He crawls over the marble sarcophagus and comes face-to-face
text: with the famed guitar. Miguel wipes away a layer of dust,
text: revealing the rich painted wood beneath. He looks up to the
dialog: portrait of de la Cruz.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Señor de la Cruz? Please don't be
dialog: mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great
dialog: grandson... I need to borrow this.
text: Heart in his throat, Miguel lifts the guitar off its mount.
text: Unbeknownst to him, some marigold petals in the mausoleum
text: begin to sparkle.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Our family thinks music is a curse.
dialog: None of them understand, but I know
dialog: you would have. You would've told
dialog: me to follow my heart. To seize my
dialog: moment!
text: He backs up, in full view of the painting.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: So if it's all right with you, I'm
dialog: gonna play in the plaza, just like
dialog: you did!
dialog: 30.
text: Confidence building, he strums it once.
text: The air around him vibrates -- radiating like a shock wave.
text: The petals on the ground whirl and surge with light for just
text: a moment. Miguel is visibly taken aback. What just
dialog: happened?
text: Suddenly, a flashlight shines in the window of the mausoleum.
speaker_heading: VOICES (O.S.)
dialog: The guitar! It's gone! Somebody
dialog: stole de la Cruz's guitar! The
text: window's broken, look.
text: Miguel hears keys jangling and the door unlocking. A
text: GROUNDSKEEPER enters with a flashlight.
speaker_heading: GROUNDSKEEPER
dialog: Alright, who's in there?
text: Startled, Miguel puts down the guitar.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I... I'm sorry! It's not what it
dialog: looks like! De la Cruz is my...
text: The groundskeeper walks straight through Miguel! He doesn't
dialog: even see him!
speaker_heading: GROUNDSKEEPER
dialog: There's nobody here!
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
text: A panicked Miguel runs out, trying to figure out what's going
text: on! But the people in the cemetery walk through him too.
text: Suddenly he hears a familiar voice.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ
dialog: Miguel!
text: Miguel turns to see Papá and Mamá still searching for him.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Mamá!
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: Miguel! Come home!
text: He reaches for his parents, but goes straight through them.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: Where are you, Miguel?!
text: Frantic, Miguel trips and falls into an open grave. A nearby
text: woman gasps and peeks over the ledge of the grave.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Dios mío! Little boy, are you
dialog: okay?
text: She reaches into the grave.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, let me help you.
text: Miguel takes her hand and she pulls him out.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Thanks, I--
text: They see each other face to face. The woman is a skeleton!
dialog: Miguel screams! She does too!
text: Miguel backs away. He turns to see another skeleton. He
text: falls backwards and scoots away frantically. He bumps into
text: another skeleton whose head falls off and lands in Miguel's
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: SKELETON HEAD
dialog: Do you mind?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Ahhh!
speaker_heading: SKELETON HEAD
dialog: Ahhh!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
speaker_heading: AHHH!
text: Miguel tosses the head away from him and turns to see the
dialog: whole cemetery is teeming with skeletons! And they can all
dialog: see him!
text: He races off and hides behind a grave. After a moment, he
text: peeks over the headstone to watch the skeletons engaging with
dialog: their living families.
text: One couple dances.
text: Another man reaches for offerings on his grave, which
text: solidify in his hands when he takes them.
dialog: 32.
text: A couple of skeletons coo over a toddler.
speaker_heading: SKELETON ABUELA
dialog: Look how big she's getting!
text: Suddenly Dante surprises Miguel and licks him on the cheek.
text: Miguel screams.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Dante?! You can see me? W-wait!
dialog: What's going on?!
text: Dante barks, points, and bounds through the crowd.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Dante! Dante!
text: Miguel gives chase until -­ BAM! He runs smack into a
text: mustached skeleton and falls to the ground. The skeleton's
text: bones break apart and scatter. The head pops up.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: Miguel?!
text: Miguel tries to gather the scattered bones.
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: Miguel?
speaker_heading: TÍA VICTORIA
dialog: Miguel?
text: The bones magically pull away from Miguel.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: You're here! HERE here!
text: PAPÁ JULIO reconstitutes himself.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO (CONT'D)
dialog: And you can see us?!
text: TÍA ROSITA charges through Papá Julio, sending his bones
text: scattering again. She grabs Miguel, hugging him tight.
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-ti-to!
text: Miguel, smothered by Rosita's ample ribcage, struggles for
dialog: air.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: Remind me how I know you?
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: We're your family, mijo!
text: Tía Rosita's ofrenda photo flashes in Miguel's memory.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Tía... Rosita?
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: Sí!
text: He looks at Papá Julio, whose head is still turned the wrong
text: way. TÍA VICTORIA straightens it.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Papá Julio?
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: Hola.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Tía Victoria?
text: Tía Victoria pokes Miguel's cheek, skeptical.
speaker_heading: TÍA VICTORIA
text: He doesn't seem entirely dead.
text: A living person ambles through Miguel's non-corporeal form.
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: He's not quite alive either...
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: We need Mamá Imelda. She'll know
dialog: how to fix this!
text: Suddenly twin skeleton gents run, huffing, toward the family.
speaker_heading: TÍO FELIPE
dialog: (huffing)
dialog: Oye!
speaker_heading: TÍO OSCAR
dialog: (winded)
dialog: It's Mamá Imelda--
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: TÍO FELIPE
dialog: (huffing)
dialog: --She couldn't cross over!
text: The others gasp.
speaker_heading: TÍO OSCAR
dialog: She's stuck--
speaker_heading: TÍO FELIPE
dialog: --On the other side!
text: Miguel sees pictures of his Tío Oscar and Tío Felipe flash in
dialog: his memory.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Tío Oscar? Tío Felipe?
speaker_heading: TÍO OSCAR
dialog: Oh, hey Miguel.
text: Tía Victoria turns her gaze on Miguel.
speaker_heading: TÍA VICTORIA
dialog: I have a feeling this has something
dialog: to do with you.
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: But if Mamá Imelda can't come to
dialog: us...
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: ...Then we are going to her!
dialog: Vámonos!
text: Papá Julio grabs Miguel by the arm and the family rushes
text: through the cemetery, trailed by Dante.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Miguel and his family weave through the graves, rounding a
dialog: corner.
text: His gaze falls upon a glowing MARIGOLD BRIDGE arching before
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Whoa...
text: The bridge extends into the mist. A stream of skeletons
text: amble across for the holiday.
dialog: 35.
text: The family passes through an invisible barrier onto the
text: bridge. Their bodies change from ghostly to solid. Miguel
text: hesitates at the threshold.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: Come on, Miguel. It's ok.
text: Miguel follows after the family, the petals glowing under his
text: feet. Dante takes off.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Dante! Dante! Dante, wait up!
text: Miguel runs after Dante, finally catching up to the dog as he
text: rolls in the petals at the crest of the bridge. He sneezes
text: some petals into Miguel's face.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You gotta stay with me, boy. We
dialog: don't know... where...
text: Out of the mist, the sparkling cityscape of the Land of the
text: Dead emerges. It's breathtaking. His family sidles up.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: This isn't a dream, then. You're
dialog: all really out there...
speaker_heading: TÍA VICTORIA
dialog: You thought we weren't?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Well I don't know, I thought it
dialog: might've been one of those made up
dialog: things that adults tell kids...
dialog: like... vitamins.
speaker_heading: TÍA VICTORIA
dialog: Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Well, now I'm thinking maybe they
dialog: could be...
text: As skeletons pass in the other direction, Miguel receives
text: some strange looks. A little skeleton girl gasps, pointing
dialog: at him.
speaker_heading: SKELETON MOTHER
dialog: Mija, it's not nice to stare at--
dialog: (seeing Miguel)
dialog: Ay! Santa Maria!
dialog: 36.
text: The woman goes wide-eyed, her head turning backwards to gawk
text: at Miguel as she walks in the opposite direction. Miguel
text: puts up his hood.
text: The Riveras continue on toward an arrivals area on the far
text: side of the bridge. Miguel sees fantastical creatures
text: crawling, flying, making nests in the nearby architecture.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Are those...? Alebrijes! But
dialog: those are--
speaker_heading: TÍO OSCAR
dialog: REAL alebrijes. Spirit
dialog: creatures...
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: They guide souls on their
dialog: journey...
speaker_heading: TÍO FELIPE
dialog: Watch your step, they make caquitas
dialog: everywhere.
text: They get to the far edge of the Marigold Bridge.
scene_heading: EXT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION
speaker_heading: CANNED LOOP (V.O.)
dialog: Welcome back to the Land of the
dialog: Dead. Please have all offerings
dialog: ready for re-entry. We hope you
dialog: enjoyed your holiday!
text: A sign reads RE-ENTRY.
speaker_heading: ARRIVALS AGENT
dialog: Welcome back! Anything to declare?
speaker_heading: TRAVELER
dialog: Some churros... from my family.
speaker_heading: ARRIVALS AGENT
dialog: How wonderful! Next!
speaker_heading: CANNED LOOP (V.O.)
dialog: ...If you are experiencing travel
dialog: issues, agents at the Department of
dialog: Family Reunions are available to
dialog: assist you.
text: Miguel and family get into the line for RE-ENTRY, along with
text: other skeletons returning from the Land of the Living.
dialog: 37.
text: Nearby, skeletons exit the Land of the Dead through a gate
text: marked DEPARTURES. Miguel watches.
speaker_heading: DEPARTURES AGENT
dialog: Next family, please!
text: An ELDERLY COUPLE steps in front of a camera-mounted monitor.
text: The monitor scans their faces and returns an image of their
text: photos on an altar in the Land of the Living.
speaker_heading: DEPARTURES AGENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, your photos are on your son's
dialog: ofrenda. Have a great visit!
speaker_heading: ELDERLY COUPLE
dialog: Gracias.
text: The couple unites with the rest of their family. They all
text: step onto the bridge, which begins to glow as they gain
dialog: footing.
speaker_heading: CANNED LOOP (V.O.)
dialog: ...And remember to return before
dialog: sunrise. Enjoy your visit!
speaker_heading: DEPARTURES AGENT
dialog: Next!
text: A skeleton man, a smile full of braces, steps up to the
dialog: monitor.
speaker_heading: DEPARTURES AGENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Your photo's on your dentist's
dialog: ofrenda. Enjoy your visit!
speaker_heading: JUAN ORTODONCIA
dialog: Grashiash!
speaker_heading: DEPARTURES AGENT
dialog: Next!
text: HÉCTOR (early 20s), a ragged fellow, steps up to the monitor,
text: disguised as Frida Kahlo.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Shall we skip the scanner? I'm on
dialog: so many ofrendas, it'll just
dialog: overwhelm your blinky thingie...
text: The monitor scans him, but an "X" appears, accompanied by a
text: negative buzzing sound.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: DEPARTURES AGENT
dialog: Well shoot. Looks like no one put
dialog: up your photo, Frida...
text: Héctor peels off his unibrow and throws off his frock.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Okay, when I said I was Frida...
dialog: just now? That... that was a lie.
dialog: And I apologize for doing that.
speaker_heading: DEPARTURES AGENT
dialog: No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing
dialog: the bridge.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You know what, I'm just gonna zip
dialog: right over, you won't even know I'm
dialog: gone.
text: Héctor bolts for the bridge. A security guards blocks the
text: gate. Héctor splits in two and slides past the guard, half
text: going over, half under.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Ha HA!
text: Héctor reaches the bridge at a sprint, but the magic doesn't
text: engage; he sinks right into the petals.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Almost there, just a little
dialog: further...!
text: The guards saunter to the bridge and casually pull Héctor
text: back toward the Land of the Dead.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Upsy-daisy...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Fine, okay. Fine, who cares...
dialog: Dumb flower bridge!
text: Miguel watches as the guards haul him out. Tía Rosita looks
text: up in time to see his back.
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: I don't know what I'd do if no one
dialog: put up my photo.
speaker_heading: ARRIVALS AGENT (O.S.)
dialog: Next!
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: Oh! Come mijo, it's our turn.
text: The arrivals line moves forward. The Dead Riveras crowd
text: around the gate. The arrivals agent leans out from his
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: ARRIVALS AGENT
dialog: Welcome back, amigos! Anything to
dialog: declare?
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: As a matter of fact, yes.
text: The family pushes Miguel to the front, very much alive.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Hola.
text: The arrivals agent's jaw literally drops.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION
text: Miguel and his family are escorted by a security guard across
text: an arching second floor walkway.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER P.A.
dialog: Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos. Marta
dialog: Gonzales-Ramos, please report to
dialog: Level 7.
text: Dante happily trots alongside. Miguel looks up to see
text: gondolas traveling by.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Whoa...
text: Skeletons stare at Miguel as he walks by. Suddenly Miguel
text: notices Tío Oscar staring at his face in deep contemplation.
speaker_heading: TÍO OSCAR
dialog: I miss my nose...
text: At the end of the walkway are doors emblazoned with
text: "DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS." The family passes through.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS
text: Inside, they find case workers helping travelers work out
dialog: holiday snafus.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: DISTRESSED TRAVELER
dialog: C'mon! Help us out amigo... We
dialog: gotta get to a dozen ofrendas
dialog: tonight...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MIFFED WIFE
dialog: We are NOT visiting your ex-wife's
dialog: family for Día de Muertos!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: In a far corner, one traveler in particular is raising hell.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: I demand to speak to the person in
dialog: charge!
text: A beleaguered CASE WORKER cringes as Mamá Imelda tears into
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: CASE WORKER
dialog: I'm sorry, señora, it says here no
dialog: one put up your photo--
text: Mamá Imelda coldly eyes the Macintosh 128k on the woman's
dialog: desk.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: My family always -- ALWAYS -- puts
dialog: my photo on the ofrenda! That
dialog: devil box tells you nothing but
dialog: lies!
text: In a swift movement, Mamá Imelda removes her shoe and smacks
dialog: the computer.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: Mamá Imelda?
text: She turns her shoe on Papá Julio, who leans back and yelps.
text: Mamá Imelda softens.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Oh, mi familia! They wouldn't let
dialog: me cross the bridge! Tell this
dialog: woman and her devil box that my
text: photo is on the ofrenda.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: Well, we never made it to the
dialog: ofrenda...
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: We ran into... um...
text: Mamá Imelda's eyes fall on Miguel.
text: Miguel looks at Mamá Imelda. Her photo flashes before him.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Miguel?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Mamá Imelda...
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: What is going on?
text: Just then, a door opens and a CLERK pokes his head out.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: You the Rivera family?
text: The computer short circuits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLERK'S OFFICE
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Well, you're cursed.
text: The family gasps.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: What?!
text: The clerk searches through a huge stack of papers.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Día de los Muertos is a night to
dialog: GIVE to the dead. You STOLE from
dialog: the dead.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: But I wasn't stealing the guitar!
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Guitar...?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: It was my great-great
dialog: grandfather's, he would have wanted
dialog: me to have it--
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak of
dialog: that...
dialog: (disgust)
dialog: ...musician! He is DEAD to this
dialog: family!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Uh, you're all dead.
text: Dante balances his paws at the edge of the clerk's desk and
text: tries to reach a plate of food.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: ACHOO! I am sorry, whose alebrije
dialog: is that?
text: Miguel steps up, trying to pull Dante away from the treats.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: That's just Dante.
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: He sure doesn't look like an
dialog: alebrije.
text: Tía Rosita gestures to the fantastical creatures fluttering
text: on the other side of the window.
speaker_heading: TÍO OSCAR
dialog: He just looks like a plain old
dialog: dog...
speaker_heading: TÍO FELIPE
dialog: ...Or a sausage someone dropped in
text: a barbershop.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Whatever he is, I am -- ACHOO! --
dialog: terribly allergic.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: But Dante doesn't have any hair.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: And I don't have a nose, and yet
dialog: here we are -- ACHOO!!
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: But none of this explains why I
dialog: couldn't cross over.
text: Miguel realizes something. He sheepishly pulls out the
dialog: folded photo.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Oh...
text: He unfolds the photo.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: You took my photo off the ofrenda?!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: It was an accident!
text: Mamá Imelda turns to the clerk, fire in her eyes.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: How do we send him back?!
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Well, since it's a family matter...
dialog: (flipping pages)
dialog: The way to undo a family curse is
dialog: to get your family's blessing.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Get your family's blessing, and
dialog: everything SHOULD go back to
dialog: normal. But you gotta do it by
dialog: sunrise!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: What happens at sunrise?
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: Híjole! Your hand!
text: Miguel looks at his hand. The tip of one of his fingers has
text: started to turn skeletal. He turns pale. He starts to faint
text: when Papá Julio picks him up and gently slaps him awake.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: Whoa, Miguel. Can't have you
dialog: fainting on us.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: But not to worry! Your family's
dialog: here, you can get your blessing
dialog: right now.
text: The clerk searches the ground near Tía Rosita.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Cempasúchil, cempasúchil. Aha!
dialog: Perdón, señora.
text: Tía Rosita titters. The clerk plucks a marigold petal from
text: the hem of her dress. He hands the petal to Mamá Imelda.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (to Imelda)
dialog: Now, you look at the living and say
dialog: his name.
text: Imelda turns to Miguel.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Miguel.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Nailed it. Now say: I give you my
dialog: blessing.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: I give you my blessing.
text: The marigold petal glows in her fingers. Miguel brightens.
dialog: But Mamá Imelda is not finished.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D)
dialog: I give you my blessing to go
dialog: home...
text: The glow of the marigold petal surges.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D)
dialog: To put my photo back on the
dialog: ofrenda...
text: Each added condition makes the petal glow brighter. Imelda
text: delivers it like a scolding, but Miguel nods.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D)
dialog: And to never play music again!
text: The petal surges one last time.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: What? She can't do that!
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Well technically she can add any
dialog: conditions she wants.
text: Miguel stares her down. Imelda is firm in her resolve.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (to Imelda)
dialog: Then you hand the petal to Miguel.
text: Imelda extends the petal to Miguel, who reaches for it.
text: He grabs the petal. WHOOOOSH! He's consumed by a whirlwind
text: of petals and disappears.
scene_heading: DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT
text: He reappears in a whirlwind of petals. It seems like he's
text: solid. He runs to the window and looks out.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No skeletons!
text: Miguel laughs, relieved. Then, a mischievous smile on his
text: face, he turns and eyes de la Cruz's guitar.
text: Miguel quickly grabs the guitar.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Mariachi Plaza, here I come--
text: He takes two steps toward the door, then WHOOOOSH!
scene_heading: CLERK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
text: Miguel appears back in the clerk's office in another flash of
text: the marigold whirlwind, without the guitar. The family
text: turns, shocked to see him back so soon.
text: Miguel realizes his hands are still in guitar-holding
dialog: position.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Two seconds and you already break
dialog: your promise!
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: This isn't fair, it's my life! You
dialog: already had yours!
text: Miguel grabs another petal, he marches over to Papá Julio.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Papá Julio, I ask for your
dialog: blessing.
text: Papá Julio shakes his head and pulls his hat down.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Tía Rosita? Oscar? Felipe? Tía
dialog: Victoria?
text: They all shake their heads.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Don't make this hard, mijo. You go
dialog: home my way, or no way.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You really hate music that much?
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: I will not let you go down the same
dialog: path he did.
text: Miguel gets an idea. He pulls the photo out and turns from
dialog: the group.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: The same path he did.
text: He gazes at the man with no face.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: He's family...
speaker_heading: TÍA VICTORIA
dialog: Listen to your Mamá Imelda.
speaker_heading: TÍO OSCAR
dialog: She's just looking out for you.
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: Be reasonable.
text: Miguel starts back toward the door.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Con permiso, I... need to visit the
dialog: restroom. Be right back!
text: Miguel sees himself out. The family waits for a beat.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Uh, should we tell him there are no
dialog: restrooms in the Land of the Dead?
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Miguel hustles down a staircase with Dante. Once on the
text: ground floor, they huddle beneath the staircase. He looks to
text: the upper floor. The Dead Riveras are there. Tío Oscar asks
text: a PATROLWOMAN about a boy of Miguel's height. The
text: patrolwoman picks up her walkie-talkie.
text: Miguel scopes the ground floor and spies a revolving door
dialog: exit.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Vámonos.
text: Miguel puts up his hood, tightening it to a tiny eye hole,
text: and heads out. Dante pads after him.
speaker_heading: PATROLWOMAN
dialog: We got a family looking for a
speaker_heading: LIVING BOY.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: If I wanna be a musician, I need a
dialog: MUSICIAN'S blessing. We gotta find
dialog: my great-great grandpa.
text: The exit gets closer when Miguel is stopped by a PATROLMAN.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Hold it, muchacho.
text: Miguel's hoodie loosens to reveal his living face.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Ahh!
text: The patrolman frantically grabs for his walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: I've found that living boy!
dialog: 48.
text: A large family passes between Miguel and the officer, chatty,
text: arms full of offerings.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Uh whoa, excuse me, excuse me
dialog: folks! Excuse me--
text: Once the family clears, Miguel is nowhere to be seen.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NEARBY CORRIDOR
text: Miguel and Dante hide from the patrolman. But Dante wanders
text: off to inspect a side room.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No, no -- Dante!
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
text: Miguel catches up to Dante. He overhears an exchange in a
text: nearby cubicle.
speaker_heading: CORRECTIONS OFFICER
dialog: ...disturbing the peace, fleeing an
text: officer, falsifying a unibrow...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: That's illegal?
speaker_heading: CORRECTIONS OFFICER
dialog: VERY illegal. You need to clean up
dialog: your act, amigo.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Amigo?
dialog: (verklempt)
dialog: Oh, that's so nice, to hear you say
dialog: that, because...
dialog: (misty)
dialog: I've just had a really hard Día de
dialog: Muertos, and I could really use an
dialog: amigo right now.
text: Héctor leans gratefully toward the officer, overwhelmed with
dialog: mock emotion.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: And amigos, they help their amigos.
dialog: Listen, you get me across that
dialog: bridge tonight and I'll make it
dialog: worth your while.
text: Héctor spies a de la Cruz poster at the officer's
dialog: workstation.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, you like de la Cruz? He and I
dialog: go way back! I can get you front
dialog: row seats to his Sunrise
dialog: Spectacular Show!
text: Miguel perks at the mention of de la Cruz.
speaker_heading: CORRECTIONS OFFICER
dialog: Uh--
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I'll -- I'll get you backstage, you
dialog: can meet him!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You just gotta let me cross that
dialog: bridge!
text: The corrections officer pulls away.
speaker_heading: CORRECTIONS OFFICER
dialog: I should lock you up for the rest
dialog: of the holiday...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But my shift's almost up, and I
dialog: wanna visit my living family... so
dialog: I'm letting you off with a warning.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Can I at least get my costume back?
speaker_heading: CORRECTIONS OFFICER
dialog: Uh, no.
text: In a huff, Héctor marches out of the room.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Some amigo...
text: Miguel follows him.
dialog: 50.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Hey. Hey! You really know de la
dialog: Cruz?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Who wants to--
dialog: (noticing Miguel)
dialog: Ah! You're alive!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Shhh!
speaker_heading: CUT INTO:
scene_heading: INT. PHONEBOOTH
text: Miguel pulls Héctor into a phone booth to avoid suspicion.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah I'm alive. And if I wanna get
dialog: back to the Land of the Living, I
dialog: need de la Cruz's blessing.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: That's weirdly specific.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: He's my great-great-grandfather.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: He's your wha-whaat...?
text: Hector's eyes drop into his mouth. He pops them back up with
text: a punch to his jaw. Miguel is a little grossed out.
text: Héctor turns to conference with himself.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
dialog: Wait, wait...
dialog: (gasp)
dialog: Wait, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait,
dialog: wait, wait, wait, wait, wait?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yes! You're going back to the Land
dialog: of the Living?!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: D'ya know what, maybe this isn't
dialog: such a g--
dialog: 51.
text: Héctor snaps his fingers rapidly, pistons firing.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: No, niño, niño, niño, I can help
dialog: you! You can help me. We can help
dialog: each other! But most importantly,
dialog: you can help ME.
text: Miguel suddenly spies his family hurrying down a staircase.
text: Mamá Imelda spots Miguel.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Miguel!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
speaker_heading: AH!
text: Héctor extends his hand.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I'm Héctor.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: That's nice!
text: Miguel grabs Héctor by the wrist and drags him to the exit,
dialog: away from his family.
scene_heading: EXT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION
text: Miguel and Dante burst out the door and rush down the stairs.
text: Héctor's arm snaps to get Miguel's attention. Miguel
text: realizes it's no longer attached to Héctor's body. The arm
text: signals backwards to Héctor who is ten paces behind.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Espérame chamaco!
text: Miguel throws the arm back to Héctor an they disappear into a
dialog: dense crowd.
text: Moments later, the Dead Riveras burst from the revolving
text: doors. Mamá Imelda scours the crowd for Miguel. He's
dialog: nowhere to be found.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Ay, he is going to get himself
dialog: killed... I need my spirit guide,
dialog: Pepita.
text: Mamá Imelda looks to the night sky, puts two fingers to her
text: mouth, and lets out a piercing whistle.
dialog: 52.
text: FWOOOMP! A giant winged jaguar lands in front of Mamá
text: Imelda. She turns to the family.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Who has that petal Miguel touched?
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: Here!
text: Papá Julio steps forward with a marigold petal. He creeps
text: forward, jittery, holding it out for Pepita.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: Nice alebrije...
text: Pepita sniffs the petal's scent.
text: Suddenly Pepita's head darts, narrowing in on the scent. She
text: takes to the air.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: Miguel sits on a wooden crate. Héctor uses his thumb to
text: smudge black and white shoe polish on the boy's face.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Hey, hey, hold still.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look up. Look up. A ver, a ver...
dialog: look up. Up, UP!... Ta-da!
text: Héctor opens a small mirror. Miguel's face is painted to
text: look like a skeleton.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
text: Dead as a doorknob.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So listen, Miguel: this place runs
dialog: on memories. When you're well-
dialog: remembered, people put up your
dialog: photo and you get to cross the
dialog: bridge and visit the living on Día
dialog: de Muertos.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Unless you're me.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You don't get to cross over.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: No one's ever put up my picture...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you can change that!
text: He unfolds an old picture. In it is a young, living Héctor.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: This is you?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Muy guapo, eh?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: So you get me to my great-great
dialog: grandpa, then I put up your photo
dialog: when I get home?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Such a smart boy! Yes! Great
dialog: idea, yes!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: One hiccup: de la Cruz is a tough
dialog: guy to get to. And I need to cross
dialog: that bridge soon. Like TONIGHT.
dialog: (upbeat)
dialog: So, you got any other family here,
dialog: you know? Someone a bit more...
dialog: accessible?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Mmm, nope.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Don't yank my chain, chamaco. You
dialog: gotta have SOME other family.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: ONLY de la Cruz. If you can't help
dialog: me, I'll find him myself.
text: Miguel marches out of the alley, whistling for Dante to
dialog: follow.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Okay, okay, kid, fine -- fine!
dialog: I'll get you to your great-great
dialog: grandpa...!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: EXT. BUSTLING STREET
text: They make their way through a pedestrian path.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: ...It's not gonna be easy, you
dialog: know? He's a busy man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Miguel slink-walks next to Héctor goofily.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I'm walking like a skeleton.
text: Blending in.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: No, skeletons don't walk like that.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: It's how you walk.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: No, I don't.
text: Miguel keeps walking funny.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it!
text: Miguel notices a billboard advertising "ERNESTO DE LA CRUZ'S
text: SUNRISE SPECTACULAR!;" "Remember Me" blares from attached
dialog: speakers.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Whoa..."Ernesto de la Cruz's
dialog: Sunrise Spectacular...!" Qué
dialog: padre!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Blech. Every year, your great-
dialog: great grandpa puts on that dumb
dialog: show to mark the end of Día de
dialog: Muertos.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: And you can get us in!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Ahhhh--
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Hey, you said you had front row
dialog: tickets!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: That... that was a lie. I
dialog: apologize for that.
text: Miguel gives Héctor a withering look.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Cool off, chamaco, come on... I'll
dialog: get you to him.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: 'Cause I happen to know where he's
dialog: rehearsing!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE, BENEATH WINDOWS
text: Héctor uses his suspenders to slingshot his arm to a third
text: floor window. The hand taps on it.
scene_heading: INT. COSTUME ROOM
text: CECILIA, a costumer, turns from a costume to look at the
text: window. Héctor's hand waves. She rolls her eyes and goes to
text: open the window.
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: You better have my dress, Héctor!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Hola, Ceci!
scene_heading: EXT. BENEATH WINDOW
text: She lowers a ladder so Héctor, Miguel and Dante can climb up.
text: Héctor grabs his arm and reattaches it.
scene_heading: INT. COSTUME ROOM
text: They all crawl in through the window.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Hola.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Ceci, I lost the dress--
speaker_heading: CECILIA
dialog: Ya lo sabía! I gotta dress forty
dialog: dancers by sunrise and thanks to
dialog: you, I'm one Frida short of an
dialog: opening number!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Ceci -- I know, Ceci. I know, I
dialog: know. Ceci -- Ceci... Ceci.
dialog: Ceci...
text: As Héctor tries to talk her down, Dante wanders away from
dialog: the costume area.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Dante... Dante!
text: Miguel chases after him.
scene_heading: INT. REHEARSAL AREA
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: We shouldn't be in here...
text: Miguel follows Dante through a giant warehouse, divided into
text: different artists workspaces. He passes papier-mâché
text: sculptures, giant paper cut out banners, a skeleton posing
dialog: nude for a painter...
text: Dante sniffs around. Suddenly an ALEBRIJE MONKEY jumps out
text: at Dante. The monkey starts riding Dante, tormenting him.
text: Miguel hustles after him.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No, no, Dante! Ven acá!
text: The monkey jumps up onto the shoulder of FRIDA KAHLO, the
text: REAL Frida Kahlo, who stands in front of a rehearsal stage.
text: Miguel reins Dante in just as Frida turns to find them.
speaker_heading: FRIDA
dialog: You! How did you get in here?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I just followed my--
dialog: 57.
text: Frida's eyes go wide when she sees Dante. She kneels and
text: takes his head in her hands.
speaker_heading: FRIDA
dialog: Oh, the mighty Xolo dog...! Guider
dialog: of wandering spirits...!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And whose spirit have you guided to
dialog: me?
text: Frida takes a closer look at Miguel.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I don't think he's a spirit guide.
speaker_heading: FRIDA
dialog: Ah-ah-ah. The alebrijes of this
dialog: world can take many forms... They
dialog: are as mysterious as they are
dialog: powerful...
text: The patterns on Frida's monkey swirl and he opens his mouth
text: to breath a blue fire. He fumbles at the end with a chesty
dialog: cough.
text: Then they look to Dante, who is chewing his own leg.
text: Suddenly, Frida turns back to Miguel.
speaker_heading: FRIDA (CONT'D)
dialog: Or maybe he's just a dog. Come! I
dialog: need your eyes!
text: Frida guides him to view the rehearsal space.
speaker_heading: FRIDA
dialog: You are the audience.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Darkness. And from the darkness...
dialog: A giant PAPAYA!
text: Lights come up on a giant papaya prop.
speaker_heading: FRIDA
text: Dancers emerge from the papaya and
dialog: the dancers are all me!
text: Leotarded, unibrowed dancers crawl around the sides of the
text: mesh papaya. Behind the papaya is an even larger half-
dialog: finished mesh structure.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: FRIDA (CONT'D)
dialog: And they go to drink from the milk
dialog: of their mother who is a cactus,
dialog: but who is also me. And her milk
dialog: is not milk but tears.
dialog: (to Miguel)
dialog: Is it too obvious?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I think it's just the right amount
dialog: of obvious?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It could use some music... Oh!
dialog: What if you did, like, doonk-doonk-
dialog: doonk-doonk...
text: Frida, inspired, cues some musicians who start playing the
dialog: tune.

dialog: Oh! And then it could go dittle-
dialog: ittle-dittle-ittle-dittle-ittle-
dialog: dittle-ittle -- WHAAA!
text: The violins follow; a trombone punctuates.
speaker_heading: FRIDA
dialog: And... what if everything was on
dialog: fire? Yes! Fire everywhere!
text: The dancers gasp and look at each other, now concerned.
speaker_heading: FRIDA
dialog: Inspired!
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: You... you have the spirit of an
dialog: artist!
text: Miguel brightens. Frida turns back to the rehearsal.
speaker_heading: FRIDA
text: The dancers exit, the music fades,
dialog: the lights go out! And Ernesto de
text: la Cruz rises to the stage!
text: A silhouette rises from a trap door. Miguel leans forward.
text: A spotlight shines on the silhouette revealing it to be a
dialog: mannequin.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: FRIDA
dialog: He does a couple of songs, the sun
text: rises, everyone cheers--
text: Miguel hustles up to Frida.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Excuse me, where's the real de la
dialog: Cruz?
speaker_heading: FRIDA
dialog: Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals.
dialog: He's too busy hosting that fancy
text: party at the top of his tower.
text: She gestures out a large window to a GRAND ESTATE lit up in
text: the distance, atop a steep hill.
text: Suddenly Héctor rounds the corner, out of breath.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Chamaco! You can't run off on me
dialog: like that! C'mon, stop pestering
dialog: the celebrities...
text: Héctor pulls Miguel away, but Miguel won't be wrangled.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You said my great-great grandpa
dialog: would be here! He's halfway across
text: town, throwing some big party.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: That bum! Who doesn't show up to
dialog: his own rehearsal?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: If you're such good friends, how
dialog: come he didn't invite you?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: He's YOUR great-great grandpa. How
dialog: come he didn't invite YOU?
text: Héctor walks away from Miguel toward the musicians.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Hey Gustavo! You know anything
dialog: about this party?
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: GUSTAVO
dialog: It's the hot ticket. But if you're
dialog: not on the guest list you're never
dialog: getting in, Chorizo...
speaker_heading: MUSICIANS
dialog: Hey, it's Chorizo! / Choricito!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Ha ha, very funny guys. Very
dialog: funny.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Chorizo?
speaker_heading: GUSTAVO
dialog: (to Miguel, re: Héctor)
dialog: Oh, this guy's famous! Go on, go
dialog: on, ask him how he died!
text: Miguel looks to Héctor, eyebrow cocked.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I don't want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: GUSTAVO
text: He choked on some CHORIZO!
text: The musicians laugh. Miguel tries to stifle a giggle.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I didn't choke, okay -- I got food
dialog: poisoning, which is a big
dialog: difference!
dialog: More laughter.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: (to Miguel)
dialog: This is why I don't like
dialog: musicians... bunch of self-
dialog: important jerks!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Hey, I'm a musician.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You are?
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: GUSTAVO
dialog: Well, if you really want to get to
dialog: Ernesto, there IS that music
dialog: competition at the Plaza de la
dialog: Cruz. Winner gets to play at his
dialog: party...
text: Miguel's wheels start turning.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: No, no, no, chamaco, you are loco
dialog: if you think--
text: Miguel looks to his hands, progressed in their skeletal
dialog: transformation.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I need to get my great-great
dialog: grandfather's blessing.
text: Miguel looks up to Héctor.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You know where I can get a guitar?
text: Héctor sighs.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I know a guy...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: Pepita sweeps across the sky, landing in a darkened corner.
text: She casts a shadow on the wall, then lurches into the light.
text: She sniffs out the spot where Héctor painted Miguel's face,
text: finding a canister of shoe polish. She lets out a low growl.
text: The Dead Riveras follow after her.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Have you found him, Pepita? Have
dialog: you found our boy?
text: Pepita breathes on the ground, revealing a footprint. It
text: glows for a moment. The family leans in to inspect.
speaker_heading: TÍA ROSITA
dialog: A footprint!
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: It's a Rivera boot!
speaker_heading: TÍO OSCAR
dialog: Size seven...
speaker_heading: TÍO FELIPE
dialog: ...and a half.
speaker_heading: TÍA VICTORIA
dialog: Pronated.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Miguel.
text: Pepita leans forward, breathes again, and the glow spreads to
text: reveal a trail of footprints.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NARROW STAIRWAY
text: Miguel follows Héctor down a steep stairway. Miguel looks to
text: his bony knuckles, concern on his face.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Why the heck would you wanna be a
dialog: musician?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: My great-great grandpa was a
dialog: musician.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: ...Who spent his life performing
dialog: like a monkey for complete
dialog: strangers. Blech, no, no thank
dialog: you, guácala, no...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Whadda you know?
text: As Miguel descends the staircase, de la Cruz's distant
text: glowing tower is obscured by old forgotten buildings.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: So, how far is this guitar anyway?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: We're almost there...
dialog: 63.
text: Héctor jumps from the stairway and crashes on the ground
text: below. But his bones reassemble immediately.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep up, chamaco, come on!
text: Héctor leads Miguel through a stone archway.
scene_heading: EXT. SHANTY TOWN
text: Graffiti on the archway depicts skeletal angels with wings
text: the color of marigolds.
text: Inside the archway, a group of ratty skeletons huddle around
text: a burning trashcan and laugh raucously. They are gray and
text: dusty, not unlike Héctor, but there's a camaraderie about
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: RATTY GROUP
speaker_heading: COUSIN HÉCTOR!!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Eh! These guys!
speaker_heading: RATTY MEMBER
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR!!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Hey Tío! Qué onda!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: These people are all your family?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Eh, in a way... We're all the ones
dialog: with no photos or ofrendas, no
dialog: family to go home to. Nearly
dialog: forgotten, you know?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So, we all call each other cousin,
dialog: or tío, or whatever.
text: They approach three old ladies playing cards around a wooden
text: crate. One, TÍA CHELO looks up.
speaker_heading: TÍA CHELO
dialog: Héctor!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Tía Chelo! He-hey!
text: Héctor hands them a bottle.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: OLD TIAS
dialog: Muchas gracias!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Hey, hey! Save some for me! Is
dialog: Chicharrón around?
speaker_heading: TÍA CHELO
dialog: In the bungalow. I don't know if
dialog: he's in the mood for visitors...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Who doesn't like a visit from
dialog: Cousin Héctor?
scene_heading: INT. SHANTY BUNGALOW TENT
text: Héctor holds the curtain open. Miguel and Dante walk in.
text: The tent is cramped, dark, and quiet. Piles are organized
text: everywhere: stacks of old dishes, a drawer full of pocket
dialog: watches, magazines, records. This place belongs to a
text: collector of things. Miguel almost knocks one stack over.
text: Héctor spies a hammock piled with old junk, a dusty hat on
text: top. He lifts the hat and finds the grumpy face of
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Buenas noches, Chicharrón!
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: I don't want to see your stupid
dialog: face, Héctor.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: C'mon, it's Día de Muertos! I
dialog: brought you a little offering!
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: Get out of here...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I would, Cheech, but the thing
dialog: is... me and my friend, Miguel, we
dialog: really need to borrow your guitar.
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: My guitar?!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: My prized, beloved guitar...?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I promise we'll bring it right
dialog: back.
text: Chicharrón sits up, incensed.
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: Like the time you promised to bring
dialog: back my van?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Uh...
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: Or my mini-fridge?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Ah, you see­-
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: Or my good napkins? My lasso? My
dialog: femur?!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: No, no, not like those times.
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: Where's my femur?! You--
text: Chicharrón raises his finger to give a tongue lashing. But
text: then he weakens and collapses in his hammock, a golden
text: flicker flashing through his bones. Héctor rushes forward.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo?
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: I'm fading, Héctor. I can feel it.
dialog: (looking to guitar)
dialog: I couldn't even play that thing if
dialog: I wanted to.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You play me something.
text: Héctor looks surprised.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You know I don't play anymore,
dialog: Cheech. The guitar's for the kid--
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: You want it, you got to earn it...
text: Héctor sighs, then reaches over Chicharrón and takes the
dialog: instrument.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Only for you, amigo. Any requests?
text: Héctor begins tuning the guitar.
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: You know my favorite, Héctor.
text: Héctor begins a lovely, lilting tune. Chicharrón smiles.
text: Miguel's eyes go wide at Héctor's skill.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: (singing)
scene_heading: WELL EVERYONE KNOWS JUANITA,
text: HER EYES EACH A DIFFERENT COLOR.
dialog: HER TEETH STICK OUT,
dialog: AND HER CHIN GOES IN,
dialog: AND HER...
dialog: Héctor eyes Miguel.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
text: ...KNUCKLES THEY DRAG ON THE FLOOR.
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: Those aren't the words!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: There are children present.
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: HER HAIR IS LIKE A BRIAR,
text: SHE STANDS IN A BOW-LEGGED STANCE.
dialog: AND IF I WEREN'T SO UGLY,
dialog: SHE'D POSSIBLY GIVE ME A CHANCE!
text: Héctor finishes with a soft flourish.
text: Chicharrón is tickled, joyful. For a moment he's present and
dialog: bright.
speaker_heading: CHICHARRÓN
dialog: Brings back memories. Gracias...
text: His eyes close. He looks at peace. Héctor looks sad.
text: Suddenly, the edges of Chicharrón's bones begin to glow. A
text: soft, beautiful light. Then... he dissolves into dust.
dialog: 67.
text: Miguel is stunned, concerned.
text: Héctor picks up his shot glass, lifts it in honor, and
text: drinks. He places it rim down next to Chicharrón's glass,
dialog: which is still full.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Wait... what happened?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: He's been forgotten.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When there's no one left in the
dialog: living world who remembers you, you
dialog: disappear from this world. We call
dialog: it the "Final Death."
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Where did he go?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: No one knows.
dialog: Miguel has a thought.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: But I've met him... I could
dialog: remember him, when I go back...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: No, it doesn't work like that,
dialog: chamaco. Our memories... they have
dialog: to be passed down by those who knew
dialog: us in life -- in the stories they
dialog: tell about us. But there's no one
dialog: left alive to pass down Cheech's
dialog: stories...
text: Miguel is deep in thought.
text: Héctor puts his hand on Miguel's back, suddenly cheerful.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, it happens to everyone
dialog: eventually.
text: He gives Miguel the guitar.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon "de la Cruzcito." You've got
dialog: a contest to win.
dialog: 68.
text: Héctor throws open the curtain and exits. Miguel looks back
text: at the glasses, then turns and follows.
scene_heading: EXT. LAND OF THE DEAD
text: Héctor and Miguel hang off the back of a moving trolley.
text: Miguel holds Héctor's photo in his hands, scanning it, while
text: Héctor fiddles on the guitar idly.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You told me you hated musicians,
dialog: you never said you were one.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: How do you think I knew your great-
dialog: great grandpa? We used to play
dialog: music together. Taught him
dialog: everything he knows.
text: Héctor plays a fancy riff, but botches the last note.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No manches! You played with
dialog: Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest
dialog: musician of all time?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Ha-ha, you're funny! Greatest
dialog: eyebrows of all time maybe but his
dialog: music, eh, not so much.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You don't know what you're talking
dialog: about...
text: The trolley arrives at the stop for the PLAZA DE LA CRUZ.
text: There's a giant statue of Ernesto de la Cruz in the center.
text: Miguel pockets Héctor's photo.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Showtime, chamaco!
text: Héctor hands the guitar to Miguel.
text: QUICK CUTS: Energetic plaza shots. Lights and colors,
text: beautiful dresses, violins, pyrotechnic bullfight, dancing.
text: A t-shirt vendor is selling "de la Cruz" shirts.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: Llévelo! T-shirts! Bobble-heads!
dialog: 69.
text: A stage is set up in the plaza.
scene_heading: EXT. ON STAGE
text: An EMCEE greets her audience.
speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: Bienvenidos a todos! Who's ready
dialog: for some música?
text: The audience whoops.
speaker_heading: EMCEE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a battle of the bands, amigos!
dialog: The winner gets to play for the
dialog: maestro himself, Ernesto de la
dialog: Cruz, at his fiesta tonight!
text: The audience cheers. Héctor elbows Miguel as they head
dialog: backstage.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: That's our ticket, muchacho.
speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: Let the competition begin!
text: QUICK MONTAGE: Acts perform on stage -- a tuba/violin act, a
text: saxophone player, a hard-core metal band, a kid who plays
text: marimba on the back of a giant iguana alebrije, a DJ with a
text: laptop and keyboard setup, a dog orchestra, nuns playing
dialog: accordions...
scene_heading: EXT. BACKSTAGE
text: Miguel and Héctor stand amongst other contestants.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: So what's the plan? What are you
dialog: gonna play?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Definitely "Remember Me."
text: Miguel plucks out the beginnings of de la Cruz's most famous
text: song. Héctor clamps his hand over the fretboard.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: No, not that one. No.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: C'mon, it's his most popular song!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Ehck, it's too popular.
text: Elsewhere backstage, they notice multiple other acts
text: rehearsing their versions.
speaker_heading: SKELETON MUSICIAN

dialog: REMEMBER ME, THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR,
speaker_heading: REMEMBER ME...
speaker_heading: OPERA SINGERS
dialog: (singing)
speaker_heading: REMEMBER ME!
dialog: DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY!
text: One man plays water glasses to the famous tune. Héctor looks
dialog: at Miguel as if to ask, "Need I say more?"
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Um... what about "Poco Loco?"
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Epa! Now that's a song!
speaker_heading: STAGEHAND
dialog: De la Cruzcito? You're on standby!
dialog: (to another band)
dialog: Los Chachalacos, you're up next!
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: An impressive banda group steps onto stage.
speaker_heading: CROWD
speaker_heading: LOS CHACHALACOS!
text: They burst into a mighty introduction and the audience goes
dialog: wild. They're very good.
speaker_heading: BACKSTAGE
text: Miguel peeks at the frenzied audience from backstage. He
text: looks sick and begins to pace, fidgety.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You always this nervous before a
dialog: performance?
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I don't know -- I've never
dialog: performed before.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: What?! You said you were a
dialog: musician!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I am!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I mean I will be. Once I win.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: That's your plan?!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No, no, no, no, no, you have to
dialog: win, Miguel. Your life LITERALLY
dialog: depends on you winning! AND YOU'VE
dialog: NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE?!
text: Héctor reaches for the guitar.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll go up there--
text: Miguel recoils, keeping hold of the instrument.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No! I need to do this.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: If I can't go out there and play
dialog: one song... how can I call myself a
dialog: musician?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: What does that matter?!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: 'Cuz I don't just want to get de la
dialog: Cruz's blessing. I need to prove
dialog: that... that I'm worthy of it.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Oh. Oh, that's such a sweet
dialog: sentiment... at SUCH a bad time!
text: Héctor looks in Miguel's eyes. The kid is sincere. Despite
text: himself, Héctor softens.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Okay... okay, okay, okay. Okay.
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay you wanna perform? Then
dialog: you've got to PERFORM!
text: Miguel perks, surprised that Héctor wants to help.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: First you have to loosen up. Shake
dialog: off those nerves! Sáquenlo
dialog: sáquenlo, sáquenlo!
text: Héctor does a loose-bone skeletal shimmy and Miguel copies.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Now gimme your best grito!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: My best grito?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Come on, yell! Belt it out!

speaker_heading: EMCEE (O.S.)
dialog: Damas y caballeros! De la

text: The crowd applauds as Miguel is led on stage.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Arre papá! Hey!
text: Héctor's face contorts with a mix of encouragement and dread.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Miguel slowly takes the stage, guitar in hand. He's blinded
text: by the lights and squints out at the audience. He's frozen
dialog: stiff.
speaker_heading: OFF STAGE
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: (to Dante)
dialog: What's he doing? Why isn't he
dialog: playing?
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Panic is painted across Miguel's face.
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER (O.S.)
dialog: Bring back the singing dogs!
text: The crowd begins to murmur impatiently. Miguel looks to
text: Héctor in the wing.
text: Héctor makes eye contact with Miguel and does the "loosen up"
text: bone shimmy.
dialog: 74.
text: On stage Miguel shakes off his nerves. Deep exhale and...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
scene_heading: HAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAI!
text: The sound is full-throated and resonant. People in the
text: audience whistle and whoop. Some return the grito, some
text: applaud lightly. His brows go up and he begins his guitar
dialog: intro.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: (singing)
dialog: WHAT COLOR IS THE SKY?
speaker_heading: AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR
dialog: YOU TELL ME THAT IT'S RED
speaker_heading: AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR
dialog: WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY SHOES?
speaker_heading: AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR

speaker_heading: AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR
text: As the audience warms up, so does Miguel. Héctor perks up,
dialog: he's got this!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: YOU MAKE ME UN POCO LOCO
scene_heading: UN POQUI-TI-TI-TO LOCO
dialog: THE WAY YOU KEEP ME GUESSING
dialog: I'M NODDING AND I'M YES-ING
dialog: I'LL COUNT IT AS A BLESSING
dialog: THAT I'M ONLY UN POCO LOCO...
text: INSTRUMENTAL INTERLUDE. Dante grabs Héctor by the leg and
text: drags him onto the stage with Miguel.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: No, no, no, no...
text: Once in the spotlight, Héctor warms up and busts out some
text: percussive footwork to Miguel's guitar.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Not bad for a dead guy!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You're not so bad yourself,
dialog: gordito! Eso!

speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Hey, you did good! I'm proud of
dialog: you! Eso!
text: Miguel swells and looks back out the crowd when he suddenly
text: spots Oscar and Felipe talking to a stranger. He looks over
dialog: and there is Tía Rosita talking to someone else! Miguel
text: looks to stage right, where he sees Papá Julio talking to the
dialog: Emcee!
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: Otra! Otra! Otra!
text: Panicking, Miguel pulls Héctor off stage. Héctor tries to
dialog: pull back.
speaker_heading: OFF STAGE
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR

speaker_heading: OFF STAGE
speaker_heading: EMCEE (O.S.)

dialog: please contact the authorities.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Wait, wait, wait! You said de la

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You could have taken my photo back
dialog: this whole time?!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: --But they hate music! I need a

speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You lied to me!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Oh, you're one to talk!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Look at me. I'm being forgotten,

dialog: gonna last the night!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm not gonna miss my one chance to

speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: It's not stupid.
text: Héctor grabs Miguel's arm and pulls him toward the stage.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I'm taking you to your family.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Let go of me!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You'll thank me later--
dialog: 78.
text: Miguel yanks his arms away.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You don't wanna help me, you only
dialog: care about yourself! Keep your
dialog: dumb photo!
text: He pulls Héctor's photo out of his pocket and throws it at
text: him. Héctor tries to grab it but it catches a breeze and
text: drifts into the crowd.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: No -- no, no, no! No...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Stay away from me!
text: As Héctor scrambles to catch his photo, Miguel runs away.
text: Héctor looks up but Miguel is gone.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?!
dialog: Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!
scene_heading: EXT. PEDESTRIAN THOROUGHFARE
text: Miguel hustles to get away from Héctor. Dante bounds after
text: him, but looks back and whimpers. He barks to get Miguel's
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Dante, cállate!
text: But Dante is insistent. He tugs at Miguel's pants, pulling
dialog: him back to Héctor.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: No, Dante! Stop it! He can't help
dialog: me!
text: Dante grabs onto his hoodie sleeve. Miguel tries to shake
text: him off, but his hoodie slips off, revealing the arms of a
text: living boy. Dante redoubles his efforts.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Dante, stop! Stop it! Leave me
dialog: alone! You're not a spirit guide,
dialog: you're just a dumb dog! Now get
dialog: out of here!
text: Miguel yanks his hoodie away from Dante, who shrinks back,
text: rebuffed. The scuffle has drawn the eyes of the crowd.
dialog: 79.
text: Startled skeletons see Miguel's arms. He hurries to get his
text: hoodie back on.
speaker_heading: CROWD MEMBERS
dialog: It's him! / It's that living boy! /
dialog: I heard about him. / Look! / He's
dialog: alive! / The boy's alive.
text: Miguel runs and jumps down some scaffolding. In the
text: distance, he sees de la Cruz's tower. After only a few
text: paces, Pepita lands in front of Miguel, cutting off his path!
text: He skids to a stop.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
speaker_heading: AAHH!
text: Then, peeking over the jaguar's head is an even more
text: terrifying sight: Mamá Imelda riding atop.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: This nonsense ends now, Miguel! I
dialog: am giving you my blessing and you
dialog: are going home!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I don't want your blessing!
text: Miguel scrambles upright and bounds for a narrow alley
dialog: staircase.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Miguel! Stop!
text: Not able to get through on her spirit guide, Imelda is forced
text: to pursue Miguel on foot.
scene_heading: EXT. NARROW STAIRCASE
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D)
dialog: Come back! Miguel!
text: He wriggles through an iron gate.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D)
dialog: I am trying to save your life!
text: She is stopped by the gate.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You're ruining my life!
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Music's the only thing that makes
dialog: me happy. And you, you wanna take
dialog: that away!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You'll never understand.
text: Miguel heads away from her up the stairs.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: (singing)
scene_heading: Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE,
scene_heading: LLORONA... NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE...
text: Miguel stops in his tracks. When Imelda finishes, he turns
text: back, confused.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I thought you hated music.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Oh, I loved it.
dialog: (reminiscing)
dialog: I remember that feeling, when my
dialog: husband would play, and I would
dialog: sing and nothing else mattered.
dialog: But when we had Coco, suddenly...
dialog: there was something in my life that
dialog: mattered more than music. I wanted
dialog: to put down roots. He wanted to
dialog: play for the world.
text: Mamá Imelda pauses for a moment, lost in a memory.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D)
dialog: We each made a sacrifice to get
dialog: what we wanted. Now you must make
dialog: a choice.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: But I don't wanna... pick sides!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why can't you be on MY side?
dialog: That's what family's supposed to do
dialog: -- support you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you never will.
dialog: 81.
text: Miguel wipes the corner of his eye, frustrated. Imelda is
text: shocked to see him so hurt, but Miguel turns away before she
text: can answer and ascends the narrow staircase toward de la
dialog: Cruz's tower.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF THE TOWER
text: Miguel arrives at the foot of the hill to de la Cruz's tower.
dialog: Vehicles from all eras (limousines, motor cars, carriages)
text: drop off finely dressed guests who line up to get aboard a
text: funicular that scales the tower to the mansion.
text: A couple at the front of the line show a fancy invitation to
text: a SECURITY GUARD, who then lets them onto the funicular.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Have a good time.
speaker_heading: GUEST
dialog: Oh, how exciting!
text: EL SANTO, the silver-masked luchador, produces a fancy
text: invitation to the security guard.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Oh! El Santo!
dialog: (giddy)
dialog: I'm a big fan.
text: The security guard sheepishly holds up a camera.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: You mind if I--
text: El Santo nods. The security guard removes his head and hands
text: it to the luchador for a selfie. His body proceeds to take
dialog: the photo.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Gracias, señor!
text: The security guard puts his head back on and El Santo heads
text: past the velvet rope. Miguel is revealed waiting in line
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Invitation?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: It's okay. I'm Ernesto's great-
dialog: great grandson!
dialog: 82.
text: Miguel strikes de la Cruz's signature pose with his guitar.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Miguel is tossed out of the line. Just then he sees Los
text: Chachalacos unloading their instruments from their van. He
text: runs up to them.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Disculpen, señores...
speaker_heading: BAND LEADER
dialog: Hey guys, it's Poco Loco!
speaker_heading: BAND MEMBER #2
dialog: You were on fire tonight!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You too! Hey, musician to
dialog: musician, I need a favor...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The Band Leader hands an invitation to the security guard.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Ooo, the competition winners!
dialog: Congratulations chicos!
text: Los Chachalacos file onto the funicular, the sousaphone
text: player angling his instrument away from the security guard.
text: After they get onto the funicular, he turns to reveal a pair
text: of legs hanging out of the bell of the sousaphone. With a
text: deep "TOOT!" Miguel spills out onto the floor of the
dialog: funicular.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Thanks guys!
text: The funicular ascends.
scene_heading: EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION
text: The doors of the funicular open to reveal de la Cruz's lavish
text: mansion. Los Chachalacos all file out.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Whoa...
speaker_heading: BAND LEADER
dialog: Enjoy the party, little músico!
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Gracias!
text: Miguel heads off toward the mansion.
text: On the stairs leading up, the party is bustling --
text: performers, servers and guests dressed to the nines.
text: A fire breather lets out flames that transform into a flurry
dialog: of butterflies.
speaker_heading: GUEST
dialog: Look, it's Ernesto!
text: Miguel catches a glimpse of de la Cruz heading deeper into
text: the party. Miguel pursues.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: De la Cruz...
scene_heading: INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION
text: Miguel heads into the foyer but loses de la Cruz in the
dialog: crowd.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Señor de la Cruz!
text: Miguel elbows his way through the room.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Pardon me, Señor de la Cruz! Señor
dialog: de la--
text: He finds himself in a huge hall with hundreds of guests, the
text: heart of the party. Film clips play all around the room from
dialog: de la Cruz's movies.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: When you see your moment, you
dialog: mustn't let it pass you by. You
dialog: must seize it.
text: Miguel takes it all in. Synchronized swimmers make
text: formations in a sparkling indoor pool. A DJ lays a decades-
text: spanning mash-up soundtrack.
text: A clip of de la Cruz riding his noble steed plays behind
dialog: Miguel.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: We're almost there, Dante.
dialog: 84.
text: Miguel jumps to see above the crowd.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Señor de la Cruz! Señor de la--
dialog: Miguel is unable to get his great-great grandfather's
text: attention. Meanwhile, a clip behind Miguel features de la
dialog: Cruz as a good-natured priest:
speaker_heading: NUN (FILM CLIP)
dialog: But what can we do? It is
dialog: hopeless...
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: You must have faith, sister.
speaker_heading: NUN (FILM CLIP)
dialog: Oh but Padre, he will never listen.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: He will listen... to MUSIC!
text: The passionate words embolden Miguel. He climbs a pillar to
text: the landing of a grand staircase, he stands above the crowd.
text: Miguel takes a breath and throws out a grito as loud as he
text: can. It echoes through the space, and party guests turn.
text: The DJ fades the music.
text: Garnering some attention, Miguel plays his guitar. More
dialog: guests turn.
text: As a hush falls on the crowd, the sound of Miguel's guitar
dialog: becomes singular.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: (singing)
speaker_heading: SEÑORAS Y SEÑORES
speaker_heading: BUENAS TARDES, BUENAS NOCHES
speaker_heading: BUENAS TARDES, BUENAS NOCHES
speaker_heading: SEÑORITAS Y SEÑORES
dialog: TO BE HERE WITH YOU TONIGHT

dialog: FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE
scene_heading: AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA
text: Miguel continues to play and sing as he nervously walks
text: forward; the crowd parting, he moves closer to DLC.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE
scene_heading: AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA
dialog: 85.
text: He passes a movie screen where a clip features de la Cruz
dialog: singing the same song in one of his films, the songs
text: overlapping for a brief moment.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL &amp; DE LA CRUZ
dialog: FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE
scene_heading: AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA
text: Miguel's soul pours into the strings as he approaches his
dialog: hero--
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANG--
text: SPLASH! Miguel tumbles into the indoor pool.
text: The party-goers gasp, but it's Ernesto who rolls up his
text: sleeves, and, in true movie hero fashion, jumps into the pool
text: and lifts a coughing Miguel to the edge.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Are you all right, niño?
text: Miguel looks up, mortified. His painted face begins to run,
text: revealing him to be a living boy. De la Cruz's eyes go wide.
text: The crowd gasps and murmurs.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: It's you... you, you are that boy,
dialog: the one who came from the Land of
dialog: the Living.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You... know about me?
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: You are all anyone has been talking
dialog: about! Why have you come here?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I'm Miguel. Your great-great
dialog: grandson.
text: More murmuring from the crowd. De la Cruz is shocked.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: I... have a great-great grandson?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I need your blessing. So I can go
dialog: back home and be a musician, just
dialog: like you.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: The rest of our family, they
dialog: wouldn't listen. But I... I hoped
dialog: you would?
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: My boy, with a talent like yours,
dialog: how could I not listen?
text: Miguel hugs de la Cruz who sweeps Miguel up onto his
text: shoulders, showing him off to the room.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: I HAVE A GREAT-GREAT GRANDSON!
text: The crowd roars.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF THE TOWER
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Look, it's Frida!
text: The silhouette of Frida Kahlo steps up to the security guard.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.
text: The security guard lets her in immediately. No need to check
dialog: the list.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: It is an honor, señora!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Gracias...
text: Hector steps onto the funicular, readjusting his unibrow to
dialog: maintain his diguise.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION
dialog: Quick cuts over instrumental version of "Remember Me:"
text: De la Cruz barges into several conversations, proudly
text: introducing Miguel. He seems almost giddy. They wedge
text: themselves into a group laughing in the garden (which
dialog: includes Jorge Negrete &amp; Pedro Infante):
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Hey Negrete! Infante! Have you
dialog: met my great-great-grandson?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Miguel chats away with de la Cruz and guests.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No

speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: No dimple!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A film clip is projected in the main hall.

speaker_heading: DON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP) MIGUEL

speaker_heading: MIGUEL DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: Poison! Poison!
dialog: 88.
text: Miguel and de la Cruz gleefully act out the ensuing fist
dialog: fight.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: You know, I did all my own stunts.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A small crowd sways, arms around shoulders, as Miguel and
text: Ernesto lead them in a chorus of "Remember Me."
scene_heading: INT. DE LA CRUZ'S OFRENDA ROOM
text: De la Cruz gestures to the massive piles of gifts from his
text: fans: bread, fruits, flowers, instruments, etc. All piled up
dialog: to the ceiling.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: All of this came from my amazing
dialog: fans in the Land of the Living!
dialog: They leave me more offerings than I
dialog: know what to do with!
text: Miguel takes in the room, it's almost too much to absorb.
text: Something seems to be on the boy's mind.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Hey, what's wrong? Is it too much?
dialog: You look overwhelmed...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No -- it's all great.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: But...?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: It's just -- I've been looking up
dialog: to you my whole life. You're the
dialog: guy who actually did it! But...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did you ever regret it? Choosing
dialog: music over... everything else.
text: De la Cruz kneels down and looks into Miguel's eyes.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: It was hard. Saying goodbye to my
dialog: hometown. Heading off on my own...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Leaving your family?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Sí. But I could not have done it
dialog: differently.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: One cannot deny who one is meant to
dialog: be. And you, my great-great
dialog: grandson, are meant to be a
dialog: musician!
text: Miguel smiles, chest swelling. He feels validated for the
dialog: first time in his life.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D)
dialog: You and I, we are artists, Miguel!
dialog: We cannot belong to one family.
dialog: The world is our family!
text: De la Cruz gestures to the sparkling city beyond his hilltop

speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Ooo, the fireworks have begun!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VERANDA
text: The party guests move outside to watch the light show.
scene_heading: INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION

text: continue to play on the walls.
text: De la Cruz and Miguel descend the staircase into the empty
dialog: hall.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Soon, the party will move across

speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You mean it?!
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Of course, my boy!
text: Miguel's chest swells. Then deflates. He lifts his shirt,
text: revealing the skeletal transition partway up his torso.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I can't... I have to get home
dialog: before sunrise.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Oh, I really do need to get you
dialog: home.
text: De la Cruz plucks a marigold petal from a vase.

speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (O.S.)

speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ

dialog: of this?
text: From the shadows, Héctor, dressed as Frida, steps into the
dialog: light.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Frida! I thought you couldn't
dialog: make it.
text: Héctor takes off the wig and throws his outfit off.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You said you'd take back my photo.
dialog: You promised, Miguel.
text: Miguel turns, backing into de la Cruz's arms. De la Cruz
text: rises to his feet, hands defensively on Miguel's shoulders.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: (to Miguel)
dialog: You know this, uh... man?
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I just met him tonight. He told me
dialog: he knew you--
text: As Héctor steps forward with the photo, de la Cruz slowly
text: recognizes him.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Hé-- Héctor?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Please Miguel, put my photo up.
text: Héctor pushes the photo into Miguel's hands. De la Cruz
dialog: intercepts it.
text: He looks from the picture to the gray, faded skeleton who
text: kneels before him. Héctor looks weak.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: My friend... you're being
dialog: forgotten...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: And whose fault is that?
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Héctor, please--
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Those were MY songs you took. MY
dialog: songs that made YOU famous.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: W-What?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: If I'm being forgotten, it's
dialog: because you never told anyone that
dialog: I wrote them--
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: That's crazy, de la Cruz wrote all
dialog: his own songs.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: (to de la Cruz)
dialog: You wanna tell him, or should I?
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Héctor, I never meant to take
dialog: credit.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D)
dialog: We made a great team but -- you
dialog: died and I -- I only sang your
dialog: songs because I wanted to keep a
dialog: part of you alive.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Oh, how generous.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You really did play together...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Look, I don't want to fight about
dialog: it. I just want you to make it
dialog: right. Miguel can put my photo up--
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Héctor...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: --And I can cross over the bridge.
dialog: I can see my girl.
text: De la Cruz looks at the photo, deliberating.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Ernesto... Remember the night I
dialog: left?
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: That was a long time ago.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: We drank together and you told me
dialog: you would move heaven and earth for
dialog: your amigo. Well, I'm asking you
dialog: to now.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Heaven and earth? Like in the
dialog: movie?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: That's Don Hidalgo's toast... in
dialog: the de la Cruz movie, "El Camino A
dialog: Casa."
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I'm talking about my real life,
dialog: Miguel.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL

speaker_heading: FILM CLIP:
speaker_heading: DON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP)
dialog: Never were truer words spoken.
dialog: This calls for A TOAST! To our
dialog: friendship! I would move Heaven

speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: But in the movie, Don Hidalgo
dialog: poisons the drink...
speaker_heading: DON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP)
dialog: Salud!
text: In the clip Don Hidalgo and de la Cruz drink. De la Cruz

speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
dialog: Poison!

speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: That night, Ernesto. The night I

speaker_heading: FLASHBACK:
scene_heading: INT. MEXICO CITY HOTEL ROOM
text: Héctor throws a songbook in a suitcase, shuts it. He grabs
text: his guitar case like he means to leave.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (V.O.)
dialog: We'd been performing on the road
dialog: for months. I got homesick -- and
dialog: I packed up my songs...
speaker_heading: YOUNG DE LA CRUZ
dialog: You wanna give up now? When we're
dialog: this close to reaching our dream?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HÉCTOR
dialog: This was your dream. You'll

speaker_heading: YOUNG DE LA CRUZ

speaker_heading: YOUNG HÉCTOR
dialog: I'm going home, Ernesto.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hate me if you want, but my mind is
dialog: made up.
text: De la Cruz looks angry. For a moment his face darkens. But
dialog: he composes himself.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Oh, I could never hate you. If you
dialog: must go, then I'm... I'm sending
dialog: you off with a toast!
text: De la Cruz pours a couple of drinks. He gives one to Héctor.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D)
dialog: To our friendship. I would move

scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY STREET
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (V.O.)
dialog: You walked me to the train station.
text: They walk down an empty street at night, Héctor with suitcase
text: and guitar case in tow. Héctor stumbles, de la Cruz steadies
text: him, takes his guitar case.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (V.O.)
dialog: But I felt a pain in my stomach. I
dialog: thought it must have been something
dialog: I ate...
speaker_heading: YOUNG DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Perhaps it was that chorizo my
dialog: friend...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (V.O.)
dialog: Or something I... drank.
dialog: 95.
text: A few more steps and Héctor collapses in the street. FADE TO
speaker_heading: BLACK.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR (V.O.)
dialog: I woke up dead.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You... POISONED me.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ

speaker_heading: FLASHBACK:
scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY STREET

speaker_heading: HÉCTOR

speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION
text: Héctor clenches his jaw. Then he bounds at de la Cruz,

speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: How could you?!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Héctor!
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Security! Security!
text: Miguel watches as Héctor and Ernesto scuffle on the floor.

speaker_heading: HÉCTOR

speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You rat!
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Have him taken care of. He's not
dialog: well.
text: The guards drag Héctor through a wide doorway.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I just wanted to go back home! No,
dialog: no, NO!
text: The doors slam shut and cut off his shouts. Miguel is left
dialog: alone with de la Cruz.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: I apologize. Where were we?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You were going to give me your
dialog: blessing...
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Yes. Uh... sí.
text: De la Cruz pulls up a marigold petal, but hesitates.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ

speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: That you murdered Héctor... for his
dialog: songs?
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: You don't think that. Do you?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I -- no! Everyone knows you're
dialog: the... the good guy.
text: Doubt enters Miguel's mind. De la Cruz darkens, he places
text: the photo of Héctor in his coat pocket, gears turning in his
dialog: mind.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Papá Ernesto? My blessing?
text: De la Cruz crumples the marigold petal.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Security!
text: De la Cruz's guards appear in the doorway.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Take care of Miguel. He'll be
dialog: extending his stay.
text: The guards grab Miguel by the shoulder.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: What?! But I'm your family!
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: And Héctor was my best friend.
text: Miguel goes pale.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Success doesn't come for free,
dialog: Miguel. You have to be willing to
dialog: do whatever it takes to... seize
dialog: your moment. I know you
dialog: understand.
text: Miguel is dragged away.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No, NO!
scene_heading: EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S TOWER
text: The guards drag Miguel out the back of de la Cruz's mansion.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Let go!
text: They throw him into a cenote, an inescapable sinkhole behind
dialog: the estate.
scene_heading: INT. CENOTE
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: NO! AHHHHHH!
dialog: 98.
text: He falls four stories and splashes into the pool at the
text: bottom of the hole. He breaks the surface and swims to a
text: stone island in the center.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Help! Can anyone hear me? I wanna
dialog: go home!
text: Miguel collapses on the stone island.
text: His soaked hoodie sags off his shoulders. The skeletal
text: transition is almost complete.
text: A moment of silence. He is alone.
text: Suddenly, Miguel hears a noise. Footsteps. Héctor emerges
text: from the darkness, looking beat up. Héctor stumbles.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Héctor?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Kid?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Oh, Héctor!
text: They run to each other. Héctor embraces Miguel. But Miguel
text: is overcome with shame.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You were right. I should have gone
dialog: back to my family--
text: Héctor tries to calm him but Miguel is shaking.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Hey -- hey, hey...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: They told me not to be like de la
dialog: Cruz, but I didn't listen--
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Hey, it's okay...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I told them I didn't care if they
dialog: remembered me. I didn't care if I
dialog: was on their stupid ofrenda.
text: Héctor holds Miguel to his chest. Miguel is tense.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Hey, chamaco, it's okay. It's
dialog: okay.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I told them I didn't care.
text: Suddenly, a golden flicker flutters through Héctor's bones,
text: and he falls to his knees.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Hhuuh!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Héctor! Héctor--
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: She's... forgetting me.
text: Miguel looks at Héctor with concern.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: My daughter...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: She's the reason you wanted to
dialog: cross the bridge...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I just wanted to see her again...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I never should have left Santa
dialog: Cecilia. I wish I could apologize.
dialog: I wish I could tell her that her
dialog: papá was trying to come home. That
dialog: he loved her so much.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My Coco...
text: A chill runs through Miguel.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Coco?
text: Miguel reaches into his hoodie and pulls out the photo of
text: Imelda, Coco, and the faceless musician.
text: Miguel shows the photo to Héctor. Héctor is confused; it's
text: like he's seen a ghost.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Where... where did you get this?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: That's my Mamá Coco. That's my
dialog: Mamá Imelda. Is that... you?
text: Gears turn in both of their heads.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: We're...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR MIGUEL
dialog: ...family? ...family?
text: Héctor is as shocked as Miguel. He looks at his great-great
dialog: grandson.
text: He looks to the photo, touches the image of baby Coco, and he
text: becomes saddened.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I always hoped I'd see her again.
dialog: That she'd miss me... maybe put up
dialog: my photo. But it never happened.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know the worst part?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Even if I never got to see Coco in
dialog: the living world... I thought at
dialog: least one day I'd see her here.
dialog: Give her the biggest hug...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But she's the last person who
dialog: remembers me. The moment she's
dialog: gone from the living world...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You disappear... from this one.
dialog: You'll never get to see her...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: ...Ever again.
text: Héctor is quiet for a moment.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You know, I wrote her a song once.
dialog: We used to sing it every night at
dialog: the same time, no matter how far
dialog: apart we were. What I wouldn't
dialog: give to sing it to her... one last
dialog: time.
dialog: 101.
text: Héctor sings softly, plaintively.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: He stole your guitar... He stole

dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You should be the one the world
dialog: remembers, not de la Cruz!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I didn't write "Remember Me" for
dialog: the world... I wrote it for Coco.
dialog: I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a
dialog: great-great grandpa.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Are you kidding? A minute ago I
dialog: thought I was related to a
dialog: murderer. You're a total upgrade!
text: Héctor doesn't smile. Miguel kneels close.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: My whole life, there's been
dialog: something that made me different...
dialog: and I never knew where it came
dialog: from.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But now I know. It comes from you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm proud we're family!
text: Miguel looks up defiantly at the hole in the cenote.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm proud to be his family!
scene_heading: TRRRRRAI-HAY-HAY-HAY-HAAAY!
text: Héctor perks up.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
scene_heading: TRRRRRRAAAAAI-HAAAI-HAAAAAY!
dialog: I'm proud to be HIS family!
text: They trade off their gritos until the cenote echoes with the
text: sound. Soon though, the echoes fade. They're still stuck.
text: Suddenly they hear a distant howling.
speaker_heading: DANTE (O.S)
dialog: Rooo-rooo-roooooooo!
text: Miguel and Héctor look up.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Dante?
speaker_heading: DANTE (O.S.)
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Roooooo-roo-roo-rooo!
dialog: 103.
text: Up at the top of the cenote, Dante pokes his head in the
dialog: opening.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Dante! It's Dante!
text: Dante pants and wags his tail happily. Behind him Pepita
text: peeks down through the hole and gives a powerful roar.
text: Pepita's call shakes the cavern. She lowers her head to
text: reveal Mamá Imelda riding atop her. Miguel and Mamá Imelda
text: laugh with joy. Until her gaze falls upon Héctor.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Imelda!
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: (icy)
dialog: Héctor.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You look good...
scene_heading: EXT. CENOTE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Pepita flies out of the cenote; Imelda, Héctor, Miguel, and
text: Dante ride on her back. She ascends above the clouds.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT SKY
text: Miguel, wind in his hair, hugs Dante fiercely.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Dante, you knew he was my Papá
dialog: Héctor the whole time! You ARE a
dialog: real spirit guide!
dialog: (doggy-praise)
dialog: Who's a good spirit guide? You
dialog: are!
text: Dante smiles at Miguel dumbly. Suddenly, before Miguel's
text: eyes, neon patterns spread outward from the dog's paws.
text: Dante begins to freak out.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Whoa...
text: A pair of little wings sprout on the dog's back. He spreads
text: them. He jumps up to fly... and plummets beneath the clouds!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Dante!
dialog: 104.
text: But then he's back up, flapping goofily and barking his head
dialog: off, a full-blown spirit guide!
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL PLAZA
text: Pepita flies in, landing in a small plaza where the other
dialog: Riveras wait.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: Look, there they are!
text: The Dead Riveras come rushing up.
speaker_heading: FAMILY
dialog: Miguel! / Miguelito! / Ay, gracias
dialog: a Dios! / It's Miguel! / He's all
dialog: right! / Oh thank goodness! /
dialog: Gracias, Dios mío!
text: They dismount from Pepita. Héctor falls off first but gets
text: up and raises his arm to help Imelda. She gives him a
text: withering stare and dismounts without his help. Miguel pets
text: Dante and Pepita gives Miguel a big lick.
text: Imelda rounds Pepita's shoulder and folds Miguel into a tight
dialog: hug.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Mijo, I was so worried! Thank
dialog: goodness we found you in time!
text: Imelda's eyes fall on Héctor, who holds his hat in his hands
text: sheepishly.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: And you! How many times must I
dialog: turn you away?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Imelda--
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: I want nothing to do with you. Not
dialog: in life, not in death!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I spent decades protecting my
dialog: family from your mistakes. He
dialog: spends five minutes with you and I
dialog: have to fish him out of a sinkhole!
text: Miguel steps between Imelda and Héctor.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I wasn't in there `cause of Héctor.
dialog: He was in there `cause of me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He was just trying to get me
dialog: home... I didn't wanna listen, but
dialog: he was right... nothing is more
dialog: important than family.
text: Mamá Imelda looks at Héctor, shocked to hear the sentiment.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm ready to accept your
dialog: blessing... and your conditions.
dialog: But first, I need to find de la
dialog: Cruz. To get Héctor's photo.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
text: So he can see Coco again. Héctor
dialog: should be on our ofrenda. He's
dialog: part of our family--
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: He left this family!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: He tried to go home to you and
dialog: Coco... but de la Cruz murdered
dialog: him!
text: Startled, she looks to Héctor for confirmation.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: It's true, Imelda.
text: Imelda wrestles with her emotions.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: And so what if it's true? You
dialog: leave me alone with a child to
dialog: raise and I'm just supposed to
dialog: forgive you?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Imelda, I--
text: Héctor's body suddenly shimmers, leaving him winded. Imelda
dialog: gasps.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Héctor?
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I'm running out of time. It's
dialog: Coco...
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: She's forgetting you...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You don't have to forgive him...
dialog: But we shouldn't forget him.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: (to Héctor)
dialog: I wanted to forget you. I wanted
dialog: Coco to forget you too, but--
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: This is my fault, not yours.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry, Imelda.
text: Mamá Imelda, holding in her emotions, turns to Miguel.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Miguel, if we help you get his
dialog: photo... you will return home? No
dialog: more music?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Family comes first.
text: Mamá Imelda considers. She turns to Héctor.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: I -- I can't forgive you. But I
dialog: will help you.
text: Miguel smiles.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: (to Miguel)
dialog: So how do we get to de la Cruz?
text: Miguel furrows his brow.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I might know a way...
dialog: 107.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNRISE SPECTACULAR AMPHITHEATER - BEFORE DAWN
text: Crowds are congregated at de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular
text: which takes place in an open air amphitheater. They hurry to
text: their seats as the lights begin to dim.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: Frida's performance piece begins. Dramatic symphonic music
text: plays as a giant papaya appears to ignite on stage. The
text: "seeds" in the body of the papaya unfurl to reveal that they
text: are dancers, each dressed like Frida Kahlo, right down to the
text: painted on unibrow.
text: The dancers roll out of the "flaming" papaya and gyrate their
text: bodies nonsensically.
text: A giant cactus that resembles Frida is illuminated, and all
text: the dancers slink to it.
text: In the midst of this, eight familiar looking dancers (the
text: Dead Riveras and Miguel) inch their way out of the spotlights
text: and to the wings of the stage.
speaker_heading: STAGE WING
speaker_heading: FRIDA
dialog: Good luck, muchacho.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Gracias Frida!
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Dead Riveras congregate in a hidden backstage corridor,
text: shedding their Frida outfits. Miguel rips off his unibrow.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Ow!
text: Dante has snuck in under Tío Oscar's skirt. Héctor sees that
text: Imelda is tangled up in her outfit.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Here, let me help you with--
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Don't touch me.
text: The family joins together in a huddle.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Everyone clear on the plan?
speaker_heading: TÍA VICTORIA
dialog: Find Héctor's photo.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ JULIO
dialog: Give it to Miguel.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Send Miguel home.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Got your petals?
text: Each family member raises a marigold petal. Imelda leads the
text: way out of the corridor.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Now, we just have to find de la
dialog: Cruz--
text: Right around the corner is de la Cruz who turns with a smile.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Ah!
text: The family stops in their tracks, still hidden from de la
text: Cruz's view. It's just him and Imelda. His smile drops.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Don't I know you?
text: Imelda pulls off her shoe and slaps de la Cruz across the
dialog: face with it.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: That's for murdering the love of my
dialog: life!
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: (disoriented)
dialog: Who the?
text: Héctor leaps out from around the corner.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: She's talking about me!
dialog: (to Imelda)
dialog: I'm the love of your life?
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: I don't know! I'm still angry at
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Héctor?! How did you--
text: Imelda slaps de la Cruz again.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: And that's for trying to murder my
dialog: grandson!
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Grandson?
text: Now Miguel leaps out of the corridor.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: She's talking about me!
text: De la Cruz sees the three of them and puts the pieces
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: You! Wait, you're related to
dialog: Héctor?
text: Miguel sees the photo in de la Cruz's pocket.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: The photo!
text: The rest of the Riveras emerge from the corridor.
text: Outnumbered, de la Cruz turns and runs.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: After him!
scene_heading: INT. BELOW STAGE
text: De la Cruz knocks over a group of giant sugar skull dancers.
text: He emerges at a full sprint to where his rising platform is
dialog: set up.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Security! Ayúdenme!
text: The Riveras flood out after him. Héctor jogs next to Imelda.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You said "love of your life..."
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: I don't know WHAT I said!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: That's what I heard...
text: A brawl ensues between the family and the guards.
text: De la Cruz runs to a stage door.
speaker_heading: STAGEHAND
dialog: Places, señor, you're on in 30
dialog: seconds!
text: De la Cruz shoves the stagehand out of the way.
text: As security guards try to wrangle the Riveras, Imelda reaches
text: de la Cruz and gets her hands on Héctor's photo. De la Cruz
text: scuffles with her to get it back, when Miguel tackles de la
text: Cruz to the ground. De la Cruz loses his grip; Imelda
text: tumbles backward, photo in hand.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Miguel! I have it!
text: Miguel turns toward Imelda but is chased by guards.
text: Suddenly, Imelda rises into the air. She is on de la Cruz's
text: rising platform! She is lifted through the ceiling and up to
dialog: the stage.
text: De la Cruz hurries up the stairs after her.
text: Miguel is detained by a security guard when Dante flies in
text: and knocks the guard's head clean off. Miguel, Héctor, Tía
text: Victoria, and Tía Rosita hurry up the stairs after de la
dialog: Cruz.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Hurry, come on!
text: Papá Julio, Tío Oscar, and Tío Felipe block the guards from
dialog: following the others.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

speaker_heading: CROWD MEMBER
dialog: Nesto!
text: Imelda appears onscreen for all to see.
speaker_heading: STAGE WING RIGHT
text: De la Cruz rushes up a staircase and arrives in the wings.
text: He gets the attention of his guards and points to Imelda.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Get her off the stage!
text: His guards hustle onto the stage, scaling the set to get to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: STAGE WING LEFT
text: Miguel, Héctor, Victoria, and Rosita emerge to see Imelda

speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: De la Cruz's guards begin to approach Imelda. She is frozen,

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (O.S.)
dialog: Sing!
text: Mamá Imelda looks down and sees Miguel in the wing.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: SING!
text: Imelda, seeing that the guards are approaching, closes her

speaker_heading: AY DE MÍ, LLORONA
scene_heading: LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE...
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: STAGE WING LEFT
text: Héctor's mouth gapes open. Tía Victoria and Tía Rosita go
text: wide-eyed.
text: Miguel sets Héctor up with a guitar, then adjusts a mic stand
text: in front of him. Héctor plays the guitar, its sound
text: amplified through the stage speakers.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
speaker_heading: AY DE MÍ, LLORONA
scene_heading: LLORONA DE AZUL CELESTE...
text: The guards reach the edge of her spotlight but stop short,
text: not wanting to interrupt the performance.
text: Imelda takes the spotlight with her as she descends the on
text: stage staircase. As she comes down, she makes eye contact
text: with her husband in the wing. He smiles as he accompanies
text: her. Imelda's eyes glint, touched to see him supporting her.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
scene_heading: Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA,
scene_heading: NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE.
speaker_heading: NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE!
text: As Héctor accompanies Imelda, she becomes more confident.
text: The audience begins to clap.
text: De la Cruz grunts in frustration.
text: Soon, the stage conductor joins with more instrumentation,
text: which kicks into high gear.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
scene_heading: ME SUBÍ AL PINO MÁS ALTO, LLORONA,
scene_heading: A VER SI TE DIVISABA.
text: She doubles down on her performance, taking the spotlight
text: with her as she moves to put distance between her and the
dialog: guards.
text: Imelda continues to vamp, trying to navigate away from the
text: guards and toward her family. One guard blocks her way, but
text: she grabs him and forces him to dance. Scared of the

speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
speaker_heading: COMO EL PINO ERA TIERNO, LLORONA

speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ/MAMÁ IMELDA
speaker_heading: AY DE MÍ, LLORONA, LLORONA

text: At the finale of the song, Imelda stomps her heel into de la

text: runs off stage with the photo.
speaker_heading: BACKSTAGE
text: Imelda arrives off stage and, somewhat high on adrenaline,
text: she embraces Héctor.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: I forgot what that felt like.
text: Héctor is taken by surprise. Imelda, realizing the

speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You... still got it.
text: They smile at each other, softening. Miguel, off to the
text: side, clears his throat.
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Ahem.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Oh!
text: Imelda, now reminded, gives Miguel the photo. She pulls out

speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA

speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA

text: The petal surges. Miguel brightens, touched.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You're going home.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: You're not going anywhere!
text: Suddenly Miguel is yanked away from his great-great
text: grandparents by de la Cruz. De la Cruz has grabbed Miguel by
text: the scruff of his hoodie.
text: Imelda lunges at de la Cruz, but he pushes her to the floor.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Imelda--
text: De la Cruz drags Miguel away as his family encroaches.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Stay back! Stay back. All of you!

speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Stay back! Not one more step.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

speaker_heading: HÉCTOR

dialog: Too hard to let him destroy
dialog: everything...
text: In the stage wings, Tía Rosita commandeers one of the cameras
text: and points it toward de la Cruz. Tía Victoria sidles up to a
text: control board and pushes a volume dial up.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: He's a living child, Ernesto!
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: He's a threat!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: STADIUM
text: The image of de la Cruz holding Miguel hostage is projected
text: on the stadium screens, the audience falls to a hush as they
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: BACKSTAGE
text: Miguel struggles against de la Cruz.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: You think I'd let him go back to
dialog: the land of the living with your
dialog: photo? To keep your memory alive?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: You're a coward!
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: I am Ernesto de la Cruz, the
dialog: greatest musician of all time!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Héctor's the real musician, you're
dialog: just the guy who murdered him and
dialog: stole his songs!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: STADIUM
text: The crowd is gobsmacked by what they are hearing.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Murder?
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: BACKSTAGE
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: I am the one who is willing to do
dialog: what it takes to seize my moment...
dialog: (darkening)
dialog: Whatever it takes.
text: Suddenly, de la Cruz throws Miguel off of the structure.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
speaker_heading: AHHH!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: NO!
text: The family runs to the ledge, horrified.
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: TÍO OSCAR/TÍO FELIPE
dialog: Miguel!
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Miguel!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: STADIUM
text: The audience gasps. Some shrieks.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: BACKSTAGE
text: De la Cruz crosses from the ledge, past Héctor, who remains
text: collapsed on the floor, breathless.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Apologies old friend, but the show
dialog: must go on...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Miguel is in free fall, the photo still in his hand. As the
text: wind whips against his face, he hears a faint howling.
text: Dante slices downward through the air, catches Miguel's shirt
text: in his teeth, and opens his wings. He and Miguel jerk
text: upward, but the photo falls from Miguel's hands and is gone
dialog: from sight.
text: Miguel and Dante twist in the air, Dante trying to slow their
text: decent but the two of them are too heavy. Miguel's shirt
text: rips and Dante loses him.
text: Miguel plummets toward the base of the tower. Suddenly
text: Pepita flies in and scoops up Miguel. Dante follows close
text: behind. Miguel looks over the side of Pepita down towards
dialog: the water.
text: The photo is lost.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: BACKSTAGE
text: De la Cruz steps up to the curtain, slicks back his hair, and
text: emerges to his audience.
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
text: De la Cruz is found by a spotlight.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Ha ha!
text: He is met with boos. He looks confused.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Boo! Murderer!
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Please, please, mi familia...
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE MEMBER
dialog: Get off the stage!
text: More booing. De la Cruz tries to kick up the orchestra.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Orchestra! A-one-A-two-A-one--
text: The conductor snaps his baton. More booing.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: (singing)
dialog: REMEMBER ME, THOUGH I HAVE TO--
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hey!--
text: The crowd pelts de la Cruz with fruit and offerings.
speaker_heading: CROWD MEMBER
dialog: Look!
text: Crowd members point up to the screen. Pepita rises above the
text: ledge with Miguel on her back. Miguel slides off her wing
text: and runs to his family.
speaker_heading: CROWD MEMBER
dialog: He's alright!
text: The crowd cheers. There are sighs of relief.
text: De la Cruz, seeing this play out on screen, realizes his
dialog: backstage treachery has been projected to the whole world.
text: He watches horrified as the image of Pepita grows larger and
text: larger on the screen as she prowls past the camera.
text: De la Cruz begins to back up just as Pepita emerges through
text: the curtain, eyes locked on him.
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: Nice kitty...
text: Suddenly Pepita head-butts de la Cruz and lifts him into the
text: sky, flinging the singer in the air like a kitten playing
text: with a ball of yarn.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
dialog: AAAHHHH! Put me down! No, please!
dialog: I beg of you, stop! Stop! NO!
text: She swings him around to gain momentum, then throws him over
dialog: the audience.
speaker_heading: DE LA CRUZ
speaker_heading: NO! AAAHHH!
text: He flies out of the stadium, hitting a giant church bell in
text: the distance. The stadium erupts in cheers.
text: In the midst of the cheering, an unsuspecting crowd member
dialog: returns from concessions.
speaker_heading: CROWD MEMBER
dialog: What did I miss?
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: BACK STAGE
text: Miguel is surrounded by family, safe. He hugs Dante.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Good boy, Dante.
text: Imelda runs to Miguel and embraces him.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Miguel!
text: Behind them, Héctor struggles to get to his feet but stumbles
text: with a flicker. Miguel runs to support him.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Héctor! The photo, I lost it...
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: It's okay, mijo. It's--
text: Suddenly Héctor suffers his most violent flickering yet. He
text: collapses. Miguel kneels by him.
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Héctor! Héctor?!
text: Héctor can barely move his limbs.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Coco...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No! We can still find the photo...
text: Mamá Imelda looks to the horizon, the first rays of sunlight
text: peeking over.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: Miguel, it's almost sunrise!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No, no, no, I can't leave you. I
dialog: promised I'd put your photo up. I
dialog: promised you'd see Coco!
text: Héctor looks at Miguel. The skeletal transformation is
text: creeping in on the edges of Miguel's face. He's almost full
dialog: skeleton now.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: We're both out of time, mijo.
text: The shimmering of Héctor's bones advances.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No, no... she can't forget you!
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: I just wanted her to know that I
dialog: loved her.
text: Héctor musters the strength to grab the marigold petal.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Héctor--
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: You have our blessing, Miguel.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ IMELDA
dialog: No conditions.
text: The petal glows.
text: Héctor struggles to lift the petal to Miguel. Mamá Imelda
text: takes his hand in hers.
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No, Papá Héctor, please!
text: Imelda and Héctor move their joined hands toward Miguel's
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: No...
text: Héctor's eyelids begin to close.
speaker_heading: HÉCTOR
dialog: Go home...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I promise I won't let Coco forget
dialog: you! Aaahh!--
text: WHOOOOSH! A whirlwind of marigold petals, and everything
dialog: goes white.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM - SUNRISE
text: Miguel finds himself back in de la Cruz's tomb.
text: Dazed, he looks through the windows; day has broken.
text: On the floor is the skull guitar. Miguel grabs it. He exits
text: the tomb and takes off out of the cemetery.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA
text: Miguel races through the plaza, past the statue of de la
dialog: Cruz.
text: Miguel races through the streets towards home. He blows
text: right past his Tío Berto snoring and Primo Abel sleeping on a
dialog: bench.
speaker_heading: TÍO BERTO
dialog: (jolting awake)
dialog: There he is!
text: Abel falls off the bench.
text: Papá comes from around a corner as Miguel is running.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: Miguel!? Stop!
dialog: 122.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERA COMPOUND
text: Miguel rounds the corner and follows the trail of marigolds
text: through the front gate.
text: He runs for Mamá Coco's bedroom. Just as he makes it to the
text: doorway, Abuelita steps up and blocks him.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Where have you been?!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Ah! I need to see Mamá Coco,
dialog: please--
text: Abuelita spies the guitar in Miguel's hand.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: What are you doing with that? Give
dialog: it to me!
text: Miguel pushes past Abuelita, and slams the door shut.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Miguel! Stop! Miguel! Miguel!
dialog: Miguel! MIGUEL!
scene_heading: INT. MAMÁ COCO'S ROOM
text: Miguel locks the door and goes up to Mamá Coco. She stares
text: into space, eyes completely vacant.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Mamá Coco? Can you hear me? It's
dialog: Miguel.
text: Miguel looks into her eyes.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I saw your papá. Remember? Papá?
dialog: Please -- if you forget him, he'll
dialog: be gone... forever!
text: She doesn't respond. Miguel's father bangs on the door.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ (O.S.)
dialog: Miguel, open this door!
text: Miguel shows her the guitar.
dialog: 123.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Here -- this was his guitar, right?
dialog: He used to play it to you? See,
dialog: there he is.
text: Still nothing. Her eyes are glazed.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Papá, remember? Papá?
text: Mamá Coco stares forward, as if Miguel isn't even there.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ (O.S.)
dialog: Miguel!
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Mamá Coco, please, don't forget
dialog: him.
text: With a rattle of keys, the door flies open. The family pours
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: What are you doing to that poor
dialog: woman?
text: Abuelita brushes Miguel aside to comfort her mother.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: It's okay, Mamita, it's okay.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: What's gotten into you?
text: Miguel looks down, defeated. Tears drip off his nose.
text: Papá's anger gives way to relief. He embraces his son.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: I thought I'd lost you, Migue...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I'm sorry, Papá.
text: Mamá steps forward.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ
dialog: We're all together now, that's what
dialog: matters.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Not all of us...
text: Abuelita returns from consoling Mamá Coco.
dialog: 124.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: It's okay, mamita.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Miguel, you apologize to your Mamá
dialog: Coco!
text: Miguel looks at Mamá Coco and approaches her.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Mamá Coco...
text: His toe accidentally taps against Héctor's skull guitar, a
text: soft hollow ringing resonates.
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Well? Apologize.
text: He comes to a realization.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Mamá Coco? Your papá -- he wanted
dialog: you to have this.
text: He picks up the guitar. Abuelita steps forward to intervene
text: but Papá places a hand on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: PAPÁ
dialog: Mamá, wait--
text: Miguel starts to sing "Remember Me" the way Héctor sang it...
text: softly, from the heart.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: (singing)
speaker_heading: REMEMBER ME
dialog: THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE
speaker_heading: REMEMBER ME
dialog: DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY
speaker_heading: MAMÁ
dialog: Look...
text: The glimmer in the Mamá Coco's eyes grows brighter with every
text: note. Memories flood in, filling the vacancy of her
text: expression with life. Her cheeks soften and plump. Her lips
text: arc into a smile.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY,
dialog: I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART
dialog: I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU
dialog: EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: REMEMBER ME
dialog: THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR
text: Miguel sings gently, with love.
text: Mamá Coco's brows slope up, delighted. The song seems to
dialog: bring her back to life.
text: Abuelita can't speak. None of them can.
text: Brimming, Mamá Coco joins Miguel in song -- her voice
text: scratchy with age, his clear with youth.
speaker_heading: MAMA COCO MIGUEL
speaker_heading: REMEMBER ME REMEMBER ME
dialog: EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD
speaker_heading: GUITAR GUITAR

dialog: THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN BE THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN BE
dialog: UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN
scene_heading: REMEMBER ME. REMEMBER ME.
text: Tears stream down Abuelita's face; she's witnessing a
dialog: miracle.
text: Mamá Coco looks to her daughter, and is troubled by her
dialog: tears.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO
dialog: Elena? What's wrong, mija?
speaker_heading: ABUELITA
dialog: Nothing Mamá. Nothing at all.
dialog: Mamá Coco turns to Miguel.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO
dialog: My papá used to sing me that song.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: He loved you, Mamá Coco. Your papá
dialog: loved you so much.
text: A smile spreads across Mamá Coco's face. She's waited a long
dialog: time to hear those words.
text: She turns to her nightstand, hand shaking. She opens a
text: drawer and pulls out a notebook.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO
dialog: I kept... his letters... poems he
dialog: wrote me... and...
dialog: 126.
text: Mamá Coco leafs through the book to reveal a torn scrap of
text: paper. She hands it to Miguel. It's the missing face from
dialog: the photo -- Héctor's face.
text: Miguel pieces the picture back together, finally seeing
text: Héctor as he was in life, a young, handsome man.
text: Mamá Coco smiles. She finds the words slowly, but she speaks
dialog: with fondness and love.
speaker_heading: MAMÁ COCO
dialog: Papá was a musician. When I was a
dialog: little girl, he and Mamá would sing
dialog: such beautiful songs...
text: The family gathers close to listen.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM

dialog: 127.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD
text: We travel through the courtyard catching glimpses of holiday

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (O.S.)
dialog: And that man is your Papá Julio...
scene_heading: INT. OFRENDA ROOM
text: Miguel holds his baby sister SOCORRO (10 months) in his arms
text: and points out all of the family members.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT'D)
dialog: ...And there's Tía Rosita... and
dialog: your Tía Victoria... and those two

dialog: just old pictures -- they're our
dialog: family -- and they're counting on
dialog: us to remember them.
text: Abuelita approaches and smiles to see her grandson passing on
text: the tradition. Then she places a picture frame on the

text: his arm around her.
text: Next to Mamá Coco's picture sits the photo of Mamá Imelda and
text: Héctor, taped back together. Restored.

speaker_heading: MIGUEL (O.S.)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: BUT LAST NIGHT IT SEEMED
dialog: THAT I DREAMED ABOUT YOU
text: Héctor's chest swells.
scene_heading: EXT. FOOT OF THE BRIDGE

text: Dante's shadow is cast against a wall. When he rounds the

dialog: the Land of the Living.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERA COURTYARD
