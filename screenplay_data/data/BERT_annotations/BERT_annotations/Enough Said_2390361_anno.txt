speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: She brought cupcakes, I brought cake
text: pops, and she goes “they’re the same
dialog: thing” but they’re not the same thing
dialog: because a cupcake is a cupcake, a cake
dialog: pop is a cake with a stick in it. Anyway,
dialog: the real issue is her daughter because
dialog: she’s not very smart whereas my daughter
dialog: Anna...

scene_heading: EXT. YOUNG MAN'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY

dialog: (to Will)
dialog: Why can’t you just do it?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I always do it. I fired the gardener.
dialog: It's not fair.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (to Eva)
dialog: We want to fire her but he won’t do it.
dialog: (to Will)
dialog: It’s not hard for you. Why does it have
dialog: to be fair?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You should do it because it’s hard for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: oh, please.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Come on Sarah, grow up. You can fire a

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (leaning forward, showing

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Pretty much.
text: Eva looks around.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: There is not one man here that I’m

speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Will, didn’t know you'd be here!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hey Jason. This is my friend Eva.
speaker_heading: JASON

speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Okay! I don’t know why you would make

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You are?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So, do they hit on you?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: You know you're starting to depress me.

speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Are you guys still friends?

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: You watch a lot of TV.
speaker_heading: ALBERT

dialog: No, no. Television history. What’s on

speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Sometimes I think we should all just wear

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What would yours say?
speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: The Container Store?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: A whole store that sells crap to put your
dialog: crap in so you can buy more crap.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I love that store. I love crap!
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: So did my ex wife. And she put it in very

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: They sell those in some manly designs,

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Manly designs?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Yeah, browns. Little cowboys.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Little cowboys? Well, if they did, my

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Living with someone else is not easy.
dialog: Peoples habits.
speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID 17
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Listen to this -
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don’t like onions in my guacamole,
dialog: right? So I would take a chip and kind of
dialog: swirl it around until the onions were all
dialog: on one side and then I could eat it. It
dialog: drove her bananas.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Seems kind of harmless.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Completely. But by the end of our

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Well, that’s not nice.
text: He notices her hands.
speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: We can’t change the volume.
text: The waiter walks away.
speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I find I don’t like younger people.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (with her hand to her ear)
dialog: Eh?
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I'm sorry. I picked the wrong

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Oh I’m having a great time. The food is
dialog: delicious. I mean I can’t hear anything

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You know, just put some in your bowl.

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (putting a pillow under

speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: In a good way? ‘Cause that can sort of
dialog: kill the chemistry.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: No, it was good. Flirtatious. I wasn’t

scene_heading: INT. EVA‘S CAR - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. ALBERT’S WESTWOOD HOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. ALBERT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: ALBERT

text: Eva picks up a Chanel purse sitting on the table.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: You carry a purse?
speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID 27
dialog: She's smart, lovely and funny ~ and she’s
text: moving to New York. Very far away. Going
dialog: to Parsons school of design. I’m very
dialog: proud of her.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I bet.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: But part of me thinks I shouldn’t let her
dialog: go. You know? She’s 18 and this is a
dialog: great opportunity for her but what if
text: something happens to her while she’s in
dialog: New York. I’1l never be able to forgive
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: The whole going away to college thing. We
dialog: send them off? We don’t know where they
dialog: are all the time? And aside from that,
dialog: what’s my life going to look like when
dialog: she’s gone? Lonely and pointless!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you know that she doesn’t even want
dialog: her father or me to take her there? She
dialog: wants to say good-bye at the airport.
dialog: Here. Not even fly with her.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: That’s horrible.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Heartbreaking, that’s the word for it. I
dialog: guess we better develop hobbies.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Yeah. I guess so.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I suppose I already have one. I knit.
dialog: I'll just knit for the rest of my life.
dialog: That’s my plan. What about you?
speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Me, too.
text: Then she looks down at Albert’s crotch and quickly looks
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT‘D)

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Look, I can see your penis.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: (looking away)
dialog: I saw your penis. Your pajama thing is

speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: So, what happened? I don’t mean the
dialog: details, just the general.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I don’t think she liked me very much. We
dialog: never had sex - not my choice, she just
dialog: had no interest in it whatsoever. I’m
dialog: pretty sure she cheated on me. That was
dialog: awful. So obviously she liked sex but
dialog: just not with me. She thought my job was
dialog: stupid. I didn’t understand her. We
dialog: parented very differently. Fought about
dialog: it, always.

dialog: Why are you wrecking my back yard?
speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID 30

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: No, no.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: You are. You’re freaked by my feet.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I have a little problem with feet. I
dialog: think it has to do with my mother.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Oh, she had feet.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Let’s just say they were overly colorful,
text: like a rainbow. Yellow, blue ~ veins and
dialog: blisters...
text: She stares at him, then moves to put her shoe back on.
speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t have to do that.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I think I should.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've never even had a pedicure. I know

speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID BL
speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Well, I’m sure they’re attracted to you.
speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You didn’t actually open your eyes at any
dialog: point, did you?
speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (talking quietly)
dialog: You have no idea. Will refused to fire

dialog: She even seemed like she wanted to be
dialog: fired cuz she was doing such stupid
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Well, good.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So I fired her and she started crying.
dialog: And then I started crying and then we

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: You're nice.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Right? Some people might think that I’m

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That’s our relationship, right there.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Oh come on, it’s so much more than that.

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I think that’s what my ex always wanted

speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID 51
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: I tried really hard. He’d go on so many

speaker_heading: SARAH

text: Will gives his wife a strange look.
speaker_heading: FRAN
dialog: It's kind of true, though. It’s good when

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Maybe second marriages work because

dialog: compromise.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Or behave, perhaps.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Thanks everyone!
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: No one is talking about you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Not you personally. In general. If I got

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Odd conversation.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It’s true. Everyone is crazy.
speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Said the first husband.

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: FRAN

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: What are you guys talking about?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I have a little trouble controlling
dialog: myself when it comes to sweets or bread,
dialog: so when Peter brought something like
dialog: cookies or chocolate or good bread home I
dialog: would eat all of it and then hate myself.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And me, for buying it in the first place.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: So, did you stop buying it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Well, just a little.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: You should be angry.
speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID
dialog: Why should you be deprived because she

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Because she’s his wife and he’s trying to

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But is that really helping her?
speaker_heading: SARAH AND EVA
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Not if we want her to learn how to

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: We??!
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: EVA (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: EVA

dialog: talked about me.
text: He looks at her as if to say “duh.”
speaker_heading: EVA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Probably not.
speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID
speaker_heading: MARIANNE

speaker_heading: MARIANNE (CONT'D)
text: He focuses so much on her and she can

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: Maybe if he had a girlfriend, or

dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE

text: Eva nods, her heart sinking.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: MARIANNE
dialog: He just never got his life together.
dialog: Okay, for instance ~ and this is just
dialog: typical Albert. When I met him he had
text: nothing next to his bed, like a table or
dialog: something. Nothing. He’d put everything
dialog: on the floor. And I thought, this is
dialog: cute, kind of bohemian or whatever. But
dialog: when we got married I got us night
dialog: tables, you know, like normal people.
dialog: Then I was in his house, I don’t know, a
dialog: year ago. And I saw all his stuff on the
dialog: floor again. I mean, I took the night
dialog: tables, granted, but you'd think he’d get
text: some new ones. Metaphorically speaking,

speaker_heading: MARIANNE

dialog: Little stars and moons and suns -
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Oh no.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Right? Why do women like things that look

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I love doll house furniture. I would eat

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: But you must have figured it out. At some
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Well, yeah, at some point.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ALBERT (CONT’D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Come on Tess. You got your phone?
speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID 88
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Yeah. Um. Okay.

speaker_heading: EVA

scene_heading: EXT. EVA'S HOUSE - SOON AFTER
text: Eva walks up to her house and sees Chloe sitting on the front

speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: CHLOE,
dialog: Mom!
text: Debbie pulls Chloe up.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You stay away from my daughter. And keep

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: But - she needs to talk about what’s
dialog: important to her and -
text: Debbie stops her.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Shut. It.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Dyke.
text: The last remark is so random Eva laughs. And then doesn't.
scene_heading: EXT. YOUNG MAN'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Eva climbs the stairs without help, miserably trying to get
dialog: on with her day.
scene_heading: INT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - DAY
text: The man with the bad breath is getting a massage. Luckily for

speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID 90
scene_heading: INT. BRENTWOOD HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: I'll tell him you came by.

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: What are you going to do with that?
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: You want one?
text: Tess sits and Eva sits beside her, taking a Cinnabon. Just

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Eva comes in as he’s putting away the food.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I just want to talk.
text: He gives her a look as if to say “so talk.”
speaker_heading: EVA (CONT’D)
dialog: It really was a coincidence and then I
dialog: wanted to stop but she needed massages
dialog: and we sort of became friends and I
dialog: didn’t know what to do.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You knew exactly what to do. You just
dialog: didn't do it.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I was very torn.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: And while you were being torn she was
dialog: poisoning our relationship? Poisoning
dialog: your perception of me?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: And why would you want that?
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I don’t know! I guess I was trying to
dialog: protect myself. You know, we’ve both been
dialog: married before, and we know how things
dialog: can turn out.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: And what about us? You didn’t protect us.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I didn’t protect us. But it’s not
dialog: poisoned Albert, I still really want us
dialog: to keep seeing each other.
speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID 92
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I wouldn't know how.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I’m so, so sorry.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: This might sound corny, but you broke my
dialog: heart. And I’m too old for that shit. And
dialog: the worst part, the worst part is that
dialog: you made me look like an idiot in front
dialog: of my daughter.
speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: I'm the idiot. I’m the idiot!
text: He looks at her, not sure what to say.
dialog: He goes to

scene_heading: INT. ELLEN’S ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
text: Eva enters Ellen’s room with the finished, hand knitted

text: walls are blank. The bedding is gone.
text: Ellen stands in the doorway and then sits beside her on the
text: bed. Eva takes her hand.
text: They glance at one another - the kind of glance that

dialog: matter how hard we try, it will always win.
scene_heading: INT. LOS ANGELES AIRPORT - SAME DAY
text: Eva, Peter and Ellen stand before the security line.
speaker_heading: EVA

speaker_heading: ENOUGH SAID 94
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I love you guys.
text: Ellen hugs and kisses them both and after a beat, lets go of
text: them. They stand there.
text: Reluctantly they all turn around and head toward the security
text: area. It’s takes an agonizing long time as Ellen gets her
text: ticket checked, and she leaves them, going to the escalator.
text: Eva tries to her best not to cry too much, Peter is doing the
text: same. As Ellen ascends, she turns, seeing her parents grow
text: smaller and smaller. And her parents, at last, see her
text: disappear in the crowd.
text: They turn, walking away. Eva breathes deeply and Peter puts
