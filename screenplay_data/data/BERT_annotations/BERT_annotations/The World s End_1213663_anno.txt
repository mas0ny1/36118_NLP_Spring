dialog: It was June 22nd 1990, our final

dialog: us. Oliver Chamberlain, Peter Page,
dialog: Steven Prince, Andy Knightley and
dialog: me. They called me The King.

speaker_heading: GARY (V.0.)
dialog: Me and the boys, we were
dialog: inseparable: Ollie was funny, he
dialog: fancied himself as a bit of a
dialog: player but really, he was all
dialog: mouth. We called him O-Man because
text: he had a birthmark that looked like
dialog: a six. He loved it.
text: We see a teenage OLIVER, a yuppie in training, with city boy
text: accessories and a brick of a mobile phone. The boys try to
text: distract him. He gives them the finger, mouths "Fuck off".
speaker_heading: GARY (V.0.)
dialog: Pete was the baby of the group. We
dialog: sort of took him under our wing.
dialog: Pete wasn't the kind of kid we'd
dialog: usually hang out with but he was
dialog: good for a laugh and his dad was
dialog: minted.
text: Diminutive PETER gets nudged in the corridor by a BURLY KID.
text: In Peter's garden, Gary cannonballs into a swimming pool,
text: soaking an older man who is apparently Peter's dad.
speaker_heading: GARY (V.0.)
dialog: Steve was a cool guy, almost as

speaker_heading: GARY (V.0.)
dialog: And Andy? Well what can I say? Andy
dialog: was my wing man. The one guy I
dialog: could rely on to back me up. I
dialog: loved him and I'm not being funny,
dialog: he loved me too.
speaker_heading: GARY (V.0.)
dialog: There were a few people we'd miss.
dialog: Mr. Shepherd was cool. I remember
dialog: one time, he asked what I wanted to
dialog: do with my life.
text: MR. SHEPHERD sits across from Gary in a careers office.
speaker_heading: GARY (V.0.)

speaker_heading: GARY (V.0.)
dialog: And so, our attempt at The Golden

text: down their pints together.
speaker_heading: GARY (V.0.)

dialog: we knew as The Reverend Green.
text: The boys buy hash from a SHIFTY LOOKING DEALER. Oliver, too
text: drunk to carry on, throws up and waves them away.
speaker_heading: GARY (V.0.)
text: Pint six put O-Man out of action,
dialog: so we carried on without him. Good
dialog: thing, I bumped into his little

text: bumped into her again.

speaker_heading: GARY (V.0.)

speaker_heading: GARY (V.0.)
dialog: After the Beehive, we had to lay
dialog: low and so we repaired to the bowls
dialog: club or as we liked to call it: The

dialog: I remember sitting up on top of

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Pretty much. She's had a bit of

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You went to the toilet.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you serious? I haven't seen you

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Well the disableds' is out of
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Gary. What happened?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I don't know, maybe one of them put

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. What happened to you?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Nothing. Nothing happened to me.

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: GARY
text: Out of order. It’s a private joke.

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I don’t want to know.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF NEWION HAVEN - LATER
text: The guys walk to the next pub. They pass an obtrusive BRONZE

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Modern art.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s a memorial isn’t it?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Yeah. To modern art.
speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh shit. Look who it is.

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Basil.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Mad Basil! D'you remember? We used

dialog: lizard people and underwater Nazis.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Didn't he spout some bullshit about
dialog: the Bermuda Triangle actually being

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No, he said it was two Isosceles

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: He was your best mate wasn't he
dialog: Steve?
speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: We've got to have one in every pub
dialog: or the whole thing's fucked.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I'd say it was fairly fucked
dialog: already.
text: They leave Gary behind. He spots three glasses of lager on a

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That was a great night.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Didn’t you manage to get off with
dialog: Erica Leekes, Peter?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I did. Something of a personal

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: She of the Marmalade Sandwich fame?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The very same.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Erika Leekes, Tracy Benson and

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I'd say that’s Erica Leekes on the
text: left, Tracy Benson on the right and
dialog: by process of elimination, Becky
text: Salt in the middle. The Marmalade

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That is very spooky.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Let's get them over.
text: Gary stands to go over, Andy pulls him back down.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: No let's not get them over. I don't

dialog: occasions.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Gym kit?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: School uniform.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Classic.
text: Gary again stands to call them over. Andy yanks him down.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Sit the fuck down and leave the
dialog: past where it is. It's bad enough
dialog: having to look at your old mugs.
dialog: Becky Salt? I'll stick with the
dialog: 20th century version, thank you.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You make it sound like we're
dialog: ancient. We haven't changed that
dialog: much. Sure, Steve's let himself go

speaker_heading: OLIVER

dialog: I hear it works for Sisters Of
dialog: Mercy tattoos too.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I still like Sisters Of Mercy.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well, you'd have to, wouldn't you?
dialog: Otherwise you'd never go swimming

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: BURLY MAN

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'd rather not dredge it all up
dialog: again, if that's okay.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Come on man, you can tell us.
dialog: Bottling up past trauma can lead to
dialog: inadequate coping strategies in
dialog: later life... apparently.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don’t know, it’s not even about
dialog: the past. It’s not about the fact
dialog: that he bullied me, that he made me
dialog: miss more school days than chicken
dialog: pox. Its not that he forced me to
dialog: spend entire lessons hiding in a
dialog: toilet cubicle, or that he punched
text: me so hard he dislodged my eyeball.
dialog: It’s not even that he ruined a
dialog: large portion of my childhood.
text: Gary’s attention drifts to a table of teens, downing shots.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s the fact that just then, he
dialog: looked straight through me, like it
dialog: all meant nothing. Probably sounds
dialog: weird doesn’t it?
speaker_heading: GARY (0.S.)
speaker_heading: SHOTS!
text: Gary returns with five full shot glasses.
speaker_heading: GARY
scene_heading: S-H-O-T-S. Shots.

dialog: something that clearly made him
dialog: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s alright, Andy.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It’s not alright, Peter. Secondly
dialog: 12 pints is more than enough and
dialog: thirdly, I DON’T FUCKING DRINK!!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Yeah, but shots don’t count-—
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Gary, you said you wanted to catch
dialog: up and chew the fat. I think you
dialog: just want to drink it. You don’t
dialog: want us here as your friends. We’re
dialog: just your fucking enablers.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Enablers. That's a funny word.
dialog: "Gary King And The Enablers’.
dialog: That's a good name for the new
dialog: band, Steve. Write that down.
speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Is that a thing?
speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You don't need us to get fucked up,

dialog: far.
text: For the first time, Gary has no comeback.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I'm going to see if there's a bus
dialog: going back to London if anyone

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

dialog: year isn't it.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Every year is the anniversary of a
dialog: year!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Exactly, and this is only the
dialog: fourth pub!
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What if it's the twelfth? What's
dialog: the difference? It's not the same
dialog: anymore Gary and it isn't that the
dialog: town's changed, we've changed.
text: Gary checks the time on his phone. Puts it on the table.
speaker_heading: GARY
text: The buses are finished.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Then we'll go back to the B&B. You
dialog: coming?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Could use an early one actually.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I should go and find Sam.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Might see if there’s a gym at the
dialog: B&B. Work this shit off.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That’s settled then.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You know what? I think you’re
dialog: jealous. You got your houses and
dialog: cars and your wives and your kids
dialog: and your job security. But you
dialog: don’t have what I have. Freedom.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (7)
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: And this is what you want? You

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: It’s... it’s just.... Mum died...
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I know and we're all sorry but now
dialog: it’s time to go home.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I thought we were home.
text: Gary, robbed of all vitality, stands and walks to the toilet.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can’t help feeling sorry for him.
text: BRRRRR BRRRRR. Gary’s mobile vibrates on the table.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Don't.
text: We see the caller ID on Gary’s phone. It reads “MUM”.
scene_heading: INT. PUB TOILETS - CONTINUOUS
text: Gary walks towards the urinal, slipping in some piss. Ina
text: rage, he goes to punch the wall, but stops, noticing an
text: existing crack in the tiles. He traces his finger along it.
text: The door opens. One of the FIVE TEENS joins at the urinal.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Careful, the floor's all pissy.
dialog: Wasn't me.
text: No reply. Gary points at the crack in the tiles.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: That was me. Did that back in '90.
dialog: 1990. Punched the shit out the
dialog: wall. Can't remember why. Seemed
dialog: important at the time.
dialog: No reply.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You look like you're having a good

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I'm doing the Golden Mile. You guys
dialog: want to tag along? We'll be like
text: the Six Musketeers.
text: The Teen doesn't answer. He walks to the wash basin.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I said I'm doing The Golden Mile.
text: The Teen still doesn't answer. He just washes his hands.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You think you're so cool don't you?
dialog: But you know what? We were cooler.
dialog: We owned this town. We paved the
dialog: way for you lot. Blazed a trail-
text: The Teen ignores Gary and walks to the hand dryer.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Look at me when I'm talking to you!
text: Gary shoves The Teen on the shoulder. The Teen turns and
text: stares at Gary with unnerving calm, his face blank.
speaker_heading: TEEN
dialog: Please don’t.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Don’t what.
text: Gary childishly shoves the Teen again.
speaker_heading: TEEN
dialog: You don't want to do that.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh don't I?
text: Gary goes to shove a third time. The Teen swats the hand away
text: and in one fluid moment, hits the button on the hand dryer
text: and GRABS GARY BY THE FACE.
text: The ROAR of the air masks the noise of the struggle.
text: A shocked Gary twists free, more in panic than with poise and
text: pushes the Teen against the wall.
text: The Teen recovers with alarming speed, grabs Gary and hurls
text: him across the toilets, with surprising strength.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Gary smashes a mirror with his face. In the cracked
text: reflection, Gary sees the teen striding towards him. Gary
text: flings himself at the Teen in a graceless rugby tackle. The
text: pair stagger backwards, slipping in the piss and fall against
text: the back wall. The teen hits the tiles and-
text: HIS HEAD COMES CLEAN OFF!
text: The DECAPITATED HEAD bounces across the floor, spinning to a
text: stop, eyes staring at Gary. The dryer stops. There is no
text: blood, only an oily BLUE FLUID leaking from the neck.
text: Gary, shocked beyond reason clutches the headless body like a
text: lover. The severed head stares back. It BLINKS. Then-
speaker_heading: ANDY (0.S.)
dialog: YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN THIS NOW!
text: A furious Andy bursts in, brandishing Gary's phone.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: But he...
text: Andy is so focused on Gary he fails to see the whole scene.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Don't change the subject!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I can't...
text: Steven, Peter and Oliver burst in to break up the fight. They
text: see the HEADLESS BODY immediately and are dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You know who I just spoke to? Your
dialog: mum! And not from the afterlife.
dialog: From fucking Bournemouth.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Andy-
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: She says she hasn't spoken to you

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: No Gary, you can't wriggle out of
dialog: this one-
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: The headless body JERKS INTO LIFE. Gary screams like a girl,
text: jumps up and throws the body down. He kicks the decapitated
text: head back into the corner. Then-
text: The HEADLESS TEEN SLOWLY STANDS UP and faces the group, more
text: blue fluid leaking out all over the floor.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: W.T.F!
text: The door behind opens. The FOUR OTHER TEENAGE BOYS come in.
text: Gary and the gang look at the BLANK FACES of the boys. Then-
text: TEEN 2 hits the hand dryer. Again, the roar signals-
text: ATTACK! TEEN 3 pounces on Steve, trying to GRAB HIS FACE.
text: Peter is knocked back into a urinal in the m ™l Oe.
text: TEENS 2, 4 & 5 ATTACK Andy, Gary and Oliver, trying to grab
text: their faces. They are relentless, with dead eyed expressions.
text: The HEADLESS TEEN 1 also grabs Andy from behind.
text: As Steve and Andy struggle, Oliver is knocked back against
text: the wall. He flails against the DEATH GRIP of his attacker
text: with such force that he ends up climbing the wall, trying to
dialog: get purchase against the ROBOTIC TEEN 2.
text: Gary meanwhile RIPS THE ARM OFF the teen attacking him (TEEN
text: 4). It pops out of its socket like an action figure. The
text: DISMEMBERED LIMB continues to flail, still alive.
text: Steve knocks his combatant (TEEN 3) into a urinal, breaking
text: it and the teen's pelvis. The urinal collapses, knocking
text: Peter over. Blue fluid mixes with the urine on the floor.
text: Steven skids around tussling with his opponent.
text: Andy keeps his opponents at bay. His anger builds until he
text: breaks out some wrestling moves against the automatons. He
text: kicks TEEN 5 into a sink and breaks it into two broken
text: pieces, then smashes the HEADLESS TEEN 1 back into the wall
text: behind, before BREAKING ITS BACK over his knee. He throws the
text: now broken teen through the doors of the toilet cubicle.
text: Oliver has now flipped over his attacker and brought him to
text: the floor. Andy drops an elbow on the TEEN 2, SMASHING HIS
text: HEAD INTO PIECES. It is hollow, breaking like a bauble.
text: Gary fights the ARMLESS TEEN 4: Beating it with its own
text: missing limb. He knocks the teen to the floor, stamps on its
text: chest and breaks off the second arm. He then wails on its
text: head with the severed limbs. The HEAD BREAKS INTO PIECES.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: Soon the floor of the bathroom is LITTERED WITH SEVERED
text: LIMBS, smashed heads and blue fluid leaking everywhere.
text: The dryer turns off. The five men hyperventilate in a
text: symphony of wheezing. They speak in hoarse staccato whispers.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: W.T.F. Gary. W.T.F...
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What the fuck does W.T.F. mean?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: This can’t be happening. Can it?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You said it mate.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I can’t believe it... I can’t

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: It was a white lie!
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: How is that a white lie?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Because she’s not dead is she?
text: Andy flails at Gary in an exhausted assault. Steven and
text: Oliver break it up and all four collapse in a heap. Peter
text: runs to the bathroom door. Before he can open it-
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Wait! Pete, where are you going?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: To get help.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Don’t do that!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don’t get help?

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: THE VOICE

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You're never wrong.
speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: That's settled then. The last thing

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: GARY

scene_heading: INT. THE GOOD COMPANIONS - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: But what if he's one of them.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Me and The Reverend had a highly

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah, I think the pronouns are
dialog: really confusing.
speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why did you never say anything?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: About what you said in the garden.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I wanted to, Sam. It just never

dialog: Something always got in the way.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (0.S.)
dialog: Here you go, get these down you.

speaker_heading: OLIVER

text: The crowd parts. Dancing like sirens before them are-
scene_heading: GARY /ANDY/PETER
dialog: The Marmalade Sandwich.

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: BASIL (CONT'D)
dialog: That was them. Nothing happened at

dialog: left, people started to change. One
text: or two at first, then more. They
dialog: replaced people of influence,

scene_heading: INT. THE MERMAID - CONTINUOUS
text: Gary, Andy and Peter, drunk with lust, as the girls work them

speaker_heading: BASIL (0.S.)
dialog: It’s not an invasion, it’s a

dialog: their chain. Which is fine unless
dialog: you say no.

scene_heading: INT. THE CLOAKROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: BASIL (0.S.)
dialog: They can bring you back exactly the

speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: SAM

text: The gang listen intently but are too drunk to take it in.
text: They shuffle and mutter comments as if they are in class.
speaker_heading: MR SHEPHERD
dialog: I know it seems weird and a bit
dialog: scary but believe me, it's quite
dialog: the opposite. They're here to help,
dialog: kids. To straighten us out and
dialog: prepare us for the big league.
dialog: They've seen something in us, a
dialog: potential, like the promise I saw
dialog: in you. There's a vast community of
text: worlds up there, living peacefully,
text: cooperatively together. A network
dialog: of unity and consistency and guess
dialog: what? They want us along for the
dialog: ride. Pretty cool, eh gang?
text: The gang struggle to concentrate. Peter is now asleep.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: So, they're not here to harm us?
speaker_heading: MR SHEPHERD
dialog: Far from it O-Man, they're here to
dialog: help. I'm not saying they're afraid
dialog: to get tough. I've had to
dialog: straighten you all out in my time.
dialog: What one among you wouldn't thank
dialog: me for it? They're much like
dialog: teachers in a way. Stern, yes;
dialog: frightening, sometimes. But it's
dialog: all for our betterment. So, what do

speaker_heading: OLIVER

text: to ape him, but is immediately KNOCKED DOWN and surrounded.
text: Andy smashes Peter's attacker out of the way and wrestles
text: with him. Gary shouts from the touchline.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Twist the melon, man!
text: Andy does so. The blank's head POPS CLEAN OFF. He uses the
text: DETACHED HEAD to smash another blank in the face.
text: Meanwhile, Sam is suddenly attacked by her PARTIALLY HEADLESS
text: BROTHER. Steven sees this and GRABS OLIVER'S ARM.
text: OLIVER'S ARM POPS OUT OF ITS SOCKET. Oliver then punches

text: Oliver turns back to Sam and flatly intones.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Sam, this is no way for a family to

text: Sam is roughly pushed aside. Gary, with drink in hand,

text: Andy meanwhile RIPS ARMS and STOMPS ON FALLEN BLANKS. He is
text: such a whirlwind of anger that he splits the room, leaving

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What does that prove?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Because of what Basil said. They
dialog: make a copy from your DNA. That's
dialog: why he had his birthmark. He was
text: new, like a baby.
speaker_heading: ANDY
text: Like a man-baby.
speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: So the blanks really are blank?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: No wear and tear, no scars.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Steven, in 1987 we were playing
dialog: cricket and I accidentally pushed
dialog: you onto a broken bottle that
dialog: nearly went up your bum.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: So show us your arse.
text: Steven drops his trousers and bends over. He shows off an
text: area of scar tissue just beneath his right buttock.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Very nice. Peter, when you got that
dialog: 50CC Suzuki in 1988, you let me
dialog: have a go and I ran over your leg.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh wait it's my other one.
text: Peter pulls up the other leg to reveal knotted scar tissue.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Andy, in 1986, we re-enacted the
dialog: Knife Game out of Aliens and I
dialog: stabbed you in the middle finger.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Or how about December 1997, when
dialog: you OD'd and I drove you to
dialog: hospital, four times over the limit
text: and ended up rolling the car and
dialog: almost severing my femoral artery
dialog: at which point you made a
text: miraculous recovery and ran off
dialog: into the night leaving me to get
dialog: arrested, after the twelve hours of
dialog: life saving surgery?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Either one of those will do.
text: Andy gives Gary the finger, revealing a distinct scar.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: What about you?
text: Gary proudly reveals his ‘Sisters of Mercy’ tattoo.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That could be drawn on.
speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: ANDY

dialog: put that metal plate in.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I don’t have to show you nothing. I
dialog: know I’m me. If I’m not me how
dialog: would I know that carved into that
dialog: beam above your head are the words
dialog: ‘KING GARY’?
speaker_heading: ANDY
text: It doesn’t say “KING GARY”
speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That was me.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Why?!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: King Gay.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That means fuck all anyway. Mr.
dialog: Shepherd remembered stuff, so did
dialog: Olly. Selective memory, remember?
dialog: We haven't seen you for years and
dialog: you brought us here. You better
dialog: come up with some hard evidence
dialog: that you're human or we're going to

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Whole town's out looking for us.
speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: ANDY

scene_heading: EXT. THE PARK - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ANDY

dialog: nobody's inside?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I mean we can still do this!
speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What? Am I what?
speaker_heading: SHANE HAWKINS
dialog: Look Peter, I know we didn't see
dialog: eye to eye at school. Goodness

speaker_heading: SHANE HAWKINS

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You're out of your mind!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: We’ve come too far, Steve.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It’s fucking suicide.
text: Gary stops and turns to them with a grin.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I’m going to get to The World’s End

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Oh shit.
text: Peter bludgeons Shane Hawkins with the branch, but hears-
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP (0.S.)
dialog: I must say, I'm very disappointed
dialog: in you Peter.
text: The MOTORCYCLE COP steps from the shadows, shakes his head.
text: Peter drops the branch, freaked out. A MASS OF BLANKS,
text: stepping out from the trees and approaching from all sides.
text: The eyes of the blanks GLOW IN THE DARK. Peter looks around
text: him. The blanks close in relentlessly and swallow him up.
text: Andy wants to help but is dragged back by Steven and Gary.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I'll punch their lights out.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: There's too many of them Andy.
text: The GLOWING EYED BLANKS envelop Peter, transforming their
text: limbs into restraints around his arms and neck.
text: The Motorcycle Cop grabs Peter's face and his hand begins to
text: glow. Peter convulses, the life draining from his face.
text: He is beyond saving. Andy's fight ebbs away. Steven and Gary

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Exactly. What?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (furious)
dialog: We’re not going to The King’s Head
dialog: Gary. We're done. We’re going to do
dialog: what we should have done in the
dialog: first place, get The Beast and get
dialog: out of here, we’re fucking leaving
dialog: and NEVER coming back. Now, you can
dialog: come with us willingly or I will

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Okay. Just think about what you’re
dialog: saying. Because, you know, you have
dialog: been drinking.
text: WHAM. Andy knocks Gary the fuck out.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF NEWION HAVEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Andy runs, an unconscious Gary over his shoulder. Steven
text: follows. A BLANK PATROL forces them to hide in a car park.
text: The blank's eyes are spotlights sweeping the streets.
text: On the other side, we see another patrol step into the light.
text: It's the FIVE TEENS from earlier. Now perfectly intact again.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Not them again.
text: Then from behind them, a strange and loud CLANKING OF METAL.
speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: We're trapped. Where's The Beast?
text: Andy whips out the TOURIST MAP from Gary's pocket.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Uh, we're here, so The Beast is

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: How the hell do we get to it?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: We’ll have to go through.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Through where?
text: Andy looks up at the nearest building and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I don’t fucking believe this.
text: Above them, swings the sign for The King’s Head.
scene_heading: INT. THE KING’S HEAD - MOMENTS LATER
text: Andy and Steve kick the door open. It’s deserted.
text: Andy lays Gary unconscious on the bar, leaving the map on his
text: chest. Andy and Steven make their way to the back and see-
text: THE BEAST in the car park of the guest house next door. Blank
text: Patrols run here and there, with growing frequency.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Right, we wait for an opening, then
dialog: leg it to The Beast.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: We need the keys.
text: Andy and Steve look back to Gary. Their jaws drop.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Gary, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Just a little toast.

speaker_heading: ANDY
text: Gary, put the pint down.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: To Oliver, Peter. And, you know
dialog: what? Ten pubs isn't bad.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It's not but we're calling time.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: So close.
text: Gary takes out a blue marker and crosses Pub 10 from the map.
text: He then sinks his pint in one. He smacks his lips, fire in
text: his eyes. He looks at Andy, who knows what he’s about to do.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: No.
text: Gary throws Andy his car keys, then pockets the map.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Gary!
text: Gary LEAPS OVER the bar and runs out through the open door.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Let him go. He left you man.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I can’t.

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: ANDY!

scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF NEWTON HAVEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Gary runs down the middle of the street towards the next pub.
text: GLOWING EYED blanks give chase. A huge spotlight illuminates
text: Gary, the sound of the BRONZE SCULPTURE growing closer.
text: Andy too is on Gary’s tail, screaming at him.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Come back you stupid bastard!
text: Gary barges aside blanks, intent on reaching his goal.
text: We see familiar faces from earlier among the blanks: The same
text: VARIOUS PASSERSBY, all THE PUBLICANS they've met.
text: He rips the arm off PUBLICAN 1 and knocks the head off
text: PUBLICAN 3 with the severed limb.
text: As he nears the eleventh pub, he runs over a picnic table,
text: and kicks the MOTORCYCLE COP in the face on the way down.
text: Andy knocks aside attackers with the same ferocity. He sees
text: Gary up ahead, ducking into The Hole in the Wall.
text: We follow Andy as he makes his way towards the pub, DODGING
text: AND FIGHTING BLANKS of all apparent ages and sizes.
text: The BRONZE SCULPTURE suddenly stands in Andy's path. He skids
text: underneath the legs without breaking his run.
text: Andy then rips the arms from two of THE TEENS and smashes
text: another two with the same dismembered limbs.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOLE IN THE WALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Andy enters The Hole in the Wall at such speed, the door
text: flies off its hinges. Gary is already behind the bar, raising
text: a pint to his lips, he sees Andy and knows he must act fast.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Andy look out!
text: TWO BLANKS pounce on Andy from behind. He barely turns to
text: swiftly and furiously dispatch them with the severed limbs.
text: Andy makes toward Gary but hears the ROAR OF AN ENGINE.
text: THE BEAST SMASHES THROUGH THE WALL. Steven is at the wheel.
text: We see SWARMS OF BLANKS approaching the new hole in the wall.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Gary, Andy, get the fuck in!
speaker_heading: GARY

text: back window. He DIVES THROUGH THE GLASS, smashing it.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: We don’t have much-
text: BANG. TEEN 1 jumps onto the Beast’s roof. Like Andy it has
text: adopted the dismembered limbs as clubs. It flips down to the
text: ground to face Steven as another blank rips the car door off.
text: A jagged shape smashes through the back window. The BRONZE
text: SCULPTURE pulls the Beast back outside with its limbs.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Steven!
text: The Beast is overwhelmed with blanks. The Teen jumps down to
text: menace Andy as the Bronze Sculpture shatters the windscreen.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (0.S.)
dialog: Andy! Go! Now!
text: Andy has no option but to follow Gary through the window.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STREETS OF NEWTON HAVEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Andy lands and rolls on the tarmac. Up ahead he sees:
text: Gary, sprinting uphill towards THE WORLD’S END. Andy follows.
text: The wind whips against Gary. The TOURIST MAP blows out of his
text: jacket and flies into the air landing in Andy’s face.
text: As he casts it aside, Andy sees the Marmalade Sandwich
text: approaching fast. He barges into Tracy Benson, knocking her
text: flying. He shoulder charges Erica Leekes then sees -
text: Becky Salt. No glowing eyes. Looking absolutely perfect.
speaker_heading: BECKY SALT

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Cheers.
scene_heading: INT. THE WORLD'S END - NIGHT
text: A single full pint stands alone on a table. Behind it, the
text: door bursts open to reveal Gary, mad, panting. He approaches
text: the drink as though it were the holy grail.
text: An eerie silence in the bar, as though the world has been
text: reduced to just Gary and the pint. He raises it to his lips.
text: SMACK! It's Andy. He slaps the glass from Gary's hand.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You've had enough!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: This is it, Andy! This is The
dialog: World's End!
speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Stop! This! Now!

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Leave me alone! What do you care?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Of course I fucking care. There's a
dialog: reason I'm angry at you, you idiot!
speaker_heading: GARY

dialog: not even MY fault that I ran off,

speaker_heading: ANDY

dialog: why I'm angry. You were Gary King.
dialog: Gary fucking King. I believed in
dialog: you. I would have followed you to
dialog: the fucking end. Jesus, I have!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Then stop following me!
text: Gary pushes Andy away and runs for the bar. Andy grabs Gary's

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What's it like to be happy, Andy?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You think it's all perfect? She
dialog: left me Gary. Do you honestly
dialog: believe I'd be here if I didn't
dialog: have an empty house? She took the
dialog: kids to her mum's three weeks ago.
dialog: Said I'm not "present" enough. You
dialog: think I gave up? No, I'm trying to
dialog: win her back. God know's, I'm
dialog: losing but I'm gonna keep fighting
dialog: Gary, because that's how we
dialog: survive. For fuck's sake, I just

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Exactly! You keep fighting for

dialog: the coat.
text: Gary desperately wriggles out of his trench-coat and throws a

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You need help Gary.
text: Andy grabs the other hand, revealing not only another bandage
text: but a hospital ID bracelet. Realisation dawns.
text: Gary pushes a shocked Andy onto the ground.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I got help. You know what help was?
dialog: Help was a lot of people, sitting
text: in a circle talking about how bad
dialog: things had got. That is not my idea
dialog: of a good time.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: And this is? It can’t all be a good

speaker_heading: GARY

text: Gary looks at Andy like a naughty schoolboy. Oh shit.
text: Suddenly the entire bar and pub floor and bar sinks into the
text: ground. It's as if the pub has become an elevator, going down
text: into the darkest depths of the Earth. Then with a BOOM -
text: The elevator hits the bottom. Behind the bar, hide Gary and
text: Andy who look out to see-
scene_heading: INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT
text: A section of the pub sits in a dark chamber underneath Newton
text: Haven. Cables and pipes line the walls, evidence of the
text: active network. Only the shaft of light from the World's End
text: above lights the sunken pub floor below.
text: There is a DEEP HUM. Gary and Andy peer into the darkness of
text: the surrounding chamber. Around them, on two higher ledges of
text: the chamber, stand a SHADOWY CIRCLE OF BLANKS looking down.

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Gary, don't go out there-

speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: Gary King.

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh yeah? How'd you manage that
dialog: then?
text: Peter steps out from the shadowy circle, now a smiling blank
text: who speaks in the same WELL SPOKEN VOICE.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We appropriate a small percentage

scene_heading: SPOKEN VOICE.
speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: THE REVEREND

speaker_heading: PETER

text: Now stepping out of the shadowy circle are FIVE INDIVIDUALS:

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh my god! I'm so cute! I'd fuck

speaker_heading: THE LIGHT

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Yeah I have. Because frankly, who
dialog: the fuck are you to come down here
dialog: and tell us what to do?
speaker_heading: THE LIGHT
dialog: We are The Network and we are here
dialog: for your betterment. In the last
dialog: twenty-three years, have you not

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: THE LIGHT

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: THE LIGHT

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: They fucked off. Result!
text: Gary, Andy and Steve cheer and celebrate. They look to see

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Andy, perhaps we should-
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Gary, let's boo-boo.
text: BANG! A huge electrical explosion erupts behind Gary.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Yeah, it's shit here innit?
text: A pipe falls from the ceiling, narrowly missing Gary and

text: escaping up a ladder at the side of the chamber.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STREETS OF NEWION HAVEN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: GARY

text: A HUGE WAVE OF RED PLASMA detonates outward towards the car.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: BACKWARDS!
text: The ENERGY WAVE gains on them, shattering all the nearby
text: windows, causing destruction and chaos.
text: Sam reverses fast, pulls a spectacular J-turn and speeds out
dialog: of Newton Haven.
text: In the slipstream of Sam’s car, Gary’s tourist map is whipped

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: We can make it.
text: The plasma wave gains inexorably, igniting the hedgerows as
text: the car struggles to outrun its fate. Sam drives to escape
text: the burning countryside, a RAPIDLY GAINING TUNNEL OF FIRE.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: We're gonna make it.
text: Sam's car is just ahead of the gaining fire as it shoots past
text: the sign saying 'THANKS FOR VISITING NEWTON HAVEN'.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: We made it!
text: Not quite. The flames of the hedgerows overtake the car. The
text: passengers are engulfed in a BLINDING RED GLOW. Then-
text: BLACKNESS.
text: We hear coughing. We see the car through a cloud of acrid
text: smoke, blackened but intact. Sam turns the key. It is dead.
text: The gang exits the car and start to walk. Gary leads them,
text: stumbling toward an orange light in the distance. Andy
text: follows, Steven and Sam behind him, holding hands.
text: The smoke clears and Gary gazes upon the same panorama he saw
text: in 1990. The valley bathed in orange light. However, it is
text: not the dawn, it's the town and surrounding fields on fire.
text: The flaming hedgerows make a fiery grid as far as they can
text: see. A nearby pylon blazes, showering sparks. They sit down
text: on the brow of the hill looking out across the scene.
text: Gary turns to Andy.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I know.
text: Andy puts his arm around Gary. They sit regarding Armageddon.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:

scene_heading: INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS
text: An older Andy talks to a group of younger people around a
text: fire. He is dressed in a medieval looking mish-mash of
text: contemporary clothing. The look and feel of these scenes are
text: post apocalyptic and neo-gothic, with much swirling smoke.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That morning gave new meaning to
dialog: the word 'hangover'. We decided to
dialog: walk it off, all the way back to
dialog: London, but the headache didn't end
dialog: there - it just went on and on.
dialog: When The Network went down, it
text: triggered a pulse that wiped out
dialog: all our technology and sent us
dialog: here, back to the Dark Ages.
text: We see the Earth reflected in Andy's glasses, we see pulse
text: waves spread out all over the globe and then... black out.
speaker_heading: ANDY (V.0O.)
dialog: There were casualties of course. I
dialog: knew a few. Some guy at work, my
dialog: cousin, Gary's mum. Nobody could be
dialog: sure how many we lost, because we
dialog: never heard from the rest of the
dialog: world again. Things aren't
dialog: connected like they used to be.
dialog: Everyone got cut off.
text: We see Andy on his property with his wife and kids, tending
text: an area of arable land, surrounded by a chain link fence.
speaker_heading: ANDY (V.0O.)
dialog: Some people say it was better when
dialog: they were here. I can see that. It
dialog: isn't easy now but it is simpler.
dialog: I'm back with the wife which is
dialog: something. We decided our problems
dialog: didn't seem as bad in the grand
dialog: scheme. We live off the land,
dialog: provide for the family. We all had
dialog: to go organic in a big way, but if
dialog: I'm honest, I'm hard pressed to
dialog: recall any processed foods I miss.
text: A MINT CORNETTO WRAPPER flutters onto the fence and then
text: flies away. Andy's slavering chops betray him.
speaker_heading: ANDY (V.0O.)

speaker_heading: ANDY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: A week or so after The Network
dialog: pulled out, they just sort of

text: We see blackened figures in the burnt out catacombs come to
text: life. The blanks awake. Peter blinks. Oliver sits up to
text: discover that his head is missing once again. He frowns.
speaker_heading: ANDY (V.0O.)
dialog: They seemed lost at first, children
dialog: cut off from their parents. I felt
dialog: a bit sorry for them to be honest.
text: The blanks stumble through society. Some are pelted with
text: tomatoes. Some reunite with tearful relatives. Oliver passes
text: graffiti reading ‘WE ARE NOT ROBOTS’. He gets dirty looks
text: from passersby. He gives them the finger, mouths “fuck off”.
speaker_heading: ANDY (V.0O.)
dialog: The Network was right about one
dialog: thing. We don’t play nice with
dialog: others. The Network was right about
dialog: a few things to be fair. Oliver
dialog: went back to being an estate agent.
dialog: People still need a roof over their
dialog: heads and the old Olly always had a
dialog: gift for the gab. I guess the new
dialog: one has too.
text: Oliver, now wearing half a football in place of his missing
text: head, shows a young couple into a rough dwelling.
text: He attempts to follow them but bumps into the door jamb.
speaker_heading: ANDY (V.0O.)
dialog: I hear the Petertron went home. He
dialog: remembered enough to know where
dialog: Bishop’s Gardens was. I suppose he
text: just picked up where he left off.
text: We see Peter approach his now overgrown and half-shuttered
text: house in Bishop’s Gardens.
speaker_heading: ANDY (V.0O.)
dialog: I’m not sure his wife noticed.
dialog: Maybe she chose not to. He’s a
dialog: pretty good dad by all accounts.
text: We see Peter sat round the breakfast table with his kids ina
text: burnt out kitchen. He takes off his hand and lets it scuttle
text: round the table. Everyone laughs. His wife enters, Peter

dialog: It’s a pretty nice shack too.

text: looking shack. Sam kisses Steven who slings a shotgun over
text: his shoulder and strides off, presumably to go hunting.
speaker_heading: ANDY (V.0O.)
dialog: As for Gary?
text: Andy looks ruefully into the distance as he remembers his old
text: friend, almost forgetting he is addressing the group.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I don’t know what happened to Gary.
dialog: We got separated and I never saw
dialog: him again. Some say he went back to
dialog: Newton Haven. I don’t know why, I
dialog: think his business there was done.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW ANGLIA - DAY
text: We see Gary, striding out of the smoke, still dressed in his

speaker_heading: ANDY (V.0O.)
dialog: Wherever he is, I hope he’s happy.
dialog: It’s funny but I miss him. I wonder
dialog: if he misses me.
text: Striding behind him, the BLANK TEENAGE VERSIONS OF ANDY,
text: STEVEN, OLIVER AND PETER. They are somewhat blackened, with
text: modifications to their garb. They too carry medieval weapons.
text: Gary leads them to a pub that stands alone in the smoky
text: apocalyptic wasteland: ‘THE RISING SUN’
text: He brings them to a halt at the door of the pub and regards
text: the sign made out of number plates. It reads ‘NO BL4 NKS’.
scene_heading: INT. THE RISING SUN - DAY
