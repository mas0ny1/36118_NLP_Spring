scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY
text: Sun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree. A
text: strong wind bends them back, showing their light green
text: bellies.
text: This is a modest house in a row of modest houses. Propane
text: tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to
dialog: be more rural than suburb.
text: CURTIS LAFORCHE(35) stands in his driveway. His eyes, locked
text: on the sky, narrow as he stares at...
text: A STORM CELL stretching out on the horizon in front of him.
text: It's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and
text: gray clouds. They swirl in and out of one another sending
text: wispy tentacles toward the ground.
text: Curtis stands, awestruck.
text: The clouds move fast overhead. He looks up as they overtake
text: his position. A light rain begins.
text: The rain pats the ground. It makes soft indentions on his
text: cotton shirt. He watches it hit the concrete, falling harder
text: now. He notices something strange.
text: The rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk. He pulls his
text: shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. He holds his
text: palm out flat in front of him. The rain pools.
text: He rubs the water through his thumb and fingers. It's an
text: amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil.
text: Curtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now.
text: Jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead. The wind bends
text: back the trunk of the maple tree.
text: Curtis stands alone at the base of the surging STORM CELL.

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Curtis holds his head under the running shower nozzle. Cool,
text: clean water rushes over his face.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: SAMANTHA(29) stands at the stovetop stirring eggs in a pan.
text: She's still dressed in her sleeping attire, an oversized T-
text: shirt and pajama bottoms with cartoon frogs on them.
text: HANNAH(5) sits at the kitchen table tearing up a piece of
dialog: toast and feeding it to the dog.
dialog: 2.
text: 
text: Hannah is a blonde little girl with a large hearing aid
text: wrapped over her right ear. It clips into her hair near the
text: back of her head. The dog's name is Red, a Rhodesian
dialog: Ridgeback that appreciates the attention.
text: Curtis enters the kitchen and kisses Hannah on the head. In
text: the same motion, he takes the piece of toast from her hand
text: and sets it on her plate.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (takes a seat)
dialog: No, no, no...Don't feed the dog
dialog: darlin'.
text: Hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds
text: it to the dog. Samantha brings the pan over and spoons eggs
dialog: out on everyone's plates.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks babe.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You slept late.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah. I need to go. What you got
dialog: going today?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I've got to finish up some curtains
dialog: for Saturday, and Nat and Cam are
text: coming over.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (MOUTH FULL)
dialog: With the kids?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Yeah. Cammie said she just needed
dialog: to get out of the house.
text: Samantha takes her seat at the table.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Tell Nat to take it easy on her.
text: Curtis gets up and goes to Hannah.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Cam can hold her own. We need to
dialog: send in the deposit for the beach
dialog: condo.
text: He kneels beside his daughter's chair and waits for her to
text: make eye contact. She looks over at him. He speaks using
text: sign language. Three broad, slow gestures.
dialog: 3.
text: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (SIGNING)
dialog: I love you.
text: Hannah puts her arms around his neck and he squeezes her. He
text: stands and grabs a sack lunch off the counter. On his way
text: out, he kisses Samantha on top of the head.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Just write the check, babe. Okay.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Okay. Bye.
text: Samantha sips her coffee as Hannah feeds more toast to the
dialog: dog.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: (as she signs)
dialog: No more food. You, eat.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY
text: Curtis shoulders his way out the front screen door. Keys in
text: his mouth and sack lunch in his hand, he makes his way down
text: the porch steps and onto the front walk.
text: He pops open the chain-link gate and heads for the PICK-UP
text: parked on the street. Clear blue sky overhead.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY
text: Small soybean plants slouch in the noonday sun. A slight
text: breeze picks up, jostling the leaves, but the sound is
text: drowned out by a loud, mechanical rumbling.
text: A spiral drill churns up dark soil as it digs deeper into the
text: ground. Curtis, wearing work goggles, grabs hold of the
text: drill's cabling system and yanks down.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah, let's keep going with that
dialog: bit! It'll go another 10 feet!
text: He yells to DEWART(36), a big guy sitting at the controls of
text: a diesel powered WELL-DRILLING RIG. The truck has a long
text: rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised HIGH on its back.
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: We won't get the gravel pack down
dialog: today!
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Why not?!
dialog: 4.
text: 
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: Those clouds! We're gonna have to
dialog: call it!
text: Curtis looks back to a potential STORM. Gray clouds forming
text: across the horizon.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Happy hour starts at five Dewart!
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Not if it's rainin'...Ready?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Oh, yeah.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY
text: Samantha sits at a table running a long piece of sheer fabric
text: through her sewing machine. She's making curtains.
text: NAT(37) sips a screwdriver from a clear plastic cup designed
text: not to sweat. She's a woman with rough edges.
text: CAMMIE(24) cradles a brown-haired BABY on top of her
dialog: pregnant, eight month belly.
text: As Nat speaks, she looks out a sliding glass door at her two
text: kids, DJ(7) and SUE(5), playing with Hannah.
speaker_heading: NAT
dialog: They were just drinkin' and
dialog: laughin' and oh, my god...it was
dialog: like I was bein' in a museum and I
text: saw the progress from apes to men.
dialog: I saw it. I saw the future.
dialog: Dewart, that was him...that was
dialog: going to be him in 20 years.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Oh my god.
text: Cammie laughs.
speaker_heading: NAT
dialog: Let me tell you, you laugh. You
dialog: laugh. But this little one in your
dialog: arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar
dialog: just like `em. Yep...
dialog: (GLANCES OUTSIDE)
dialog: Hannah!
text: Samantha jumps up from her sewing to see outside. Hannah,
text: with her back to the house, bangs a 2 X 4 with a rusted nail
text: in the end into the ground. Samantha is out the door.
dialog: 5.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Samantha walks briskly, talking to the other children.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You guys okay?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Samantha takes a wide line around Hannah, who continues
text: banging the two-by-four into the ground. As soon as the
text: child sees her mother, she stops.
text: Samantha crouches in front of Hannah, gently taking the board
text: away from her. Samantha signs with her hand and speaks at
dialog: the same time.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: No. Don't touch.
text: Hannah tilts her head, looking off to the side. Samantha
text: touches her chin bringing her eyes back around.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: (signing and speaking)
dialog: You understand?
text: Hannah nods once, "yes".
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oksy. Come here.
text: Samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the
text: back corner of the yard. A STORM SHELTER is buried in the
text: ground just behind the pile. It's a grass covered mound with
text: two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky.
text: She throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her
text: pants. Staring at the pile, she lets out an irritated sigh.
text: Thunder rumbles low in the distance. She looks up at the
text: approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks
text: back inside.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, DJ. Bring the girls inside.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY
text: THUNDER STRIKE.
text: The drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the dark
text: soil into black mud.
dialog: 6.
text: 
text: Curtis holds a rain slicker over his head. He watches as the
text: hole they are drilling fills up with brown water. He lifts
text: his boot, which makes a sucking sound as it dislodges from
dialog: the mud.
text: Looking at the horizon, he sees no sign of the storm letting
text: up. He looks to Dewart, who smiles at him from behind the
text: controls of the rig.
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: What? It's not my fault! I told
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah. All right...All right! I'm
dialog: callin' it! Shut it down!
text: Dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee.
text: 
scene_heading: I/E. LAFORCHE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Samantha holds the front door open as Nat and Cammie leave
text: with their children packed up and in tow. It's raining
dialog: pretty hard outside.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Bye guys. Thanks for coming over.
speaker_heading: NAT
dialog: I'll call next week about the Lions
dialog: Club supper.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Okay. Love you.
speaker_heading: CAMMIE
dialog: Bye Sam.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Bye Cam.
text: Running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat.
text: Samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house. The
text: rain outside is the only noise. She heads to the kitchen.
text: IN THE KITCHEN,
text: Hannah is sitting Indian-style at the glass doors watching
text: the rain. Samantha walks over and kneels down behind her.
text: She wraps her arms around Hannah, who lifts a hand to the
text: glass.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you sign s-t-o-r-m?
dialog: 7.
text: 
text: Samantha puts her hand onto the glass next to Hannah's and
text: signs "s-t-o-r-m". Hannah turns to see her mother's face,
text: and Samantha uses both hands to make the signed symbol.
text: Fingers, spread and bent, moved downward.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Storm.
text: Hannah looks back out the window. They watch the storm
dialog: together.
text: 
scene_heading: I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/DEWART'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The blue top of a small cooler is knocked to the floorboard
text: as Dewart fishes the last Busch tallboy out of icy water. He
text: cracks it open and takes an extended sip.
text: Curtis, sitting behind the wheel of his truck, looks at his
dialog: drunk friend.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I gotta get home.
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: Nat and me been lookin' into a
dialog: threesome. We've been chattin' with
dialog: a girl online from Canton. Yeah.
dialog: Big `ol girl.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What's big?
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: She's about two fifty, two seventy
dialog: five. She can't be no taller than
dialog: 5 foot.
text: Dewart starts laughing, which makes Curtis laugh.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Shit man.
text: The laughing subsides.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't see me and Sam gettin' into
dialog: somethin' like that.
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: No. I don't guess you would.
text: Dewart is staring at Curtis.
speaker_heading: DEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: You got a good life Curtis.
dialog: 8.
text: 
text: Curtis shrugs.
speaker_heading: DEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm serious. I think that's the
dialog: best compliment you can give a man,
dialog: take a look at his life and say,
dialog: that's good. That guy's doin'
dialog: somethin' right.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Well. It ain't always so easy.
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: Hell I know that.
text: Dewart sees something out his window.
speaker_heading: DEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah shit. I gotta go...Manana.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Good night.
text: Nat, in a house robe and slippers, weaves her way through the
text: maze of junk on their front lawn.
text: Dewart passes her without saying a word. Curtis watches as
text: she follows him inside the house, still talking. He shifts
text: into drive and pulls away.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. LAFORCHE HOME - NIGHT
text: The lights are out and the house is quiet. Curtis eases open
text: the front door and steps inside. Standing on the door mat,
text: he slips off his mud-caked boots and gently sets them aside.
text: AT HANNAH'S BEDROOM DOOR,
text: Curtis places his palm flat on the door and lets it open.
text: Hannah is curled up with the covers. He watches her sleep.
text: Samantha, barefoot and wearing a sleep shirt, walks up behind
text: Curtis. He turns his head when she approaches.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Hey baby.
text: She wraps her arms around his waist and he lifts his elbow to
text: make room for her. They whisper.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: She do all right today?
dialog: 9.
text: 
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: She was fine. She's still not
dialog: playin' with the others, though.
dialog: She can't connect. Honey, you
dialog: gotta clean up that trash pile in
text: the back. She fished out a board
dialog: that had nails on it.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I'll get to it this weekend.
text: It's quiet for a moment.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I still take off my boots so I
dialog: won't wake her up.
text: She smiles up at her husband.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I still whisper.
text: He pulls her tight. They stand together in the doorway. The
text: house is silent.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - DAY
text: Curtis loads pieces from the trash pile into a wheelbarrow.
text: He keeps an eye on Hannah as she jumps on a small, plastic
text: playscape in the middle of the backyard.
text: The dog, Red, paces by the back door. He's agitated, but his
text: movement is limited by the length of rope tied from his
text: collar to a nearby post. He barks.
text: THUNDER STRIKES.
text: Curtis flinches at the loud boom. He looks to the sky and
text: sees dark clouds twisting overhead. Hannah plays, unaffected
text: by the noise.
text: To get a better view, Curtis moves from beneath a tree in the
text: corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland
text: that runs up to his property.
text: Chain-link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete
text: culvert that leads out to the open field.
text: A giant STORM CELL gathers force on the horizon there.
text: Red barks incessantly. He winces and strains against the
text: rope tied to his collar.
text: Curtis flinches again as A BOLT OF LIGHTNING streaks to the
text: ground in the distance. Sparks shoot into the air leaving a
text: circle of scorched crops. Another CRACK of thunder.
dialog: 10.
text: 
text: A light rain begins. Red snaps his head around and bucks
text: into the air. He gnashes at the rope.
text: Curtis collects Hannah off the playscape and turns back to
text: the approaching STORM CELL. He holds up his hand and studies
text: the falling rain. It's the thick, amber colored liquid.
text: With Hannah in his arms, Curtis watches, awestruck, as wispy
text: tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of THREE
text: TORNADOS out in the field.
text: Behind them, Red's teeth fray the rope at his collar. He
text: thrashes his head, the rope SNAPS, and the dog flies toward
dialog: Curtis and Hannah.
text: Curtis turns to see Red charging them. He barely has time to
text: set Hannah down before Red catches him by the forearm.
text: They crash to the ground, tangled together. Rain coming down
dialog: hard now.
text: Curtis yells and waves Hannah back. Red, snapping, buries
text: his teeth into the muscles in Curtis' arm. Blood streams
text: from the wound.
text: Curtis screams in pain.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Curtis bolts up in bed grabbing his forearm. He grinds his
text: teeth and doubles over in pain. It takes a moment for him to
text: find his bearings.
text: His breathing slows. He gently rubs his hand over the skin
text: on his arm. Sweat has collected around his collar and
dialog: temples.
text: From the bed, sheets in a twisted mess, he looks around the
text: room unsure of what just happened to him.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Eggs cool on a plate.
text: Curtis sits at the kitchen table dressed for work. He stares
text: vacantly at his breakfast.
text: He looks up at Hannah. She sits on the floor surrounded by
text: toy building blocks and plays with the dog. She rubs under
text: Red's chest and in turn he licks her face. She smiles and
text: gently pushes him away.
text: Samantha sits with her knees up drinking coffee.
dialog: 11.
text: 
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Curtis?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Did you hear me? You got to be
text: home, showered, ready to walk out
dialog: the door by six tonight.
text: Curtis stands up and goes over to Hannah. He grabs her off
text: the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Nothing. I just want her to eat her
dialog: breakfast and stop playin' with the
dialog: damn dog.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: She's fine down there. She had
dialog: toast already.
text: Curtis, against flailing, manages to get Hannah in her chair.
text: Curtis backs off, frustrated. Hannah climbs down from her
text: chair and goes back to the floor and the dog.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hannah. Come here. Hannah.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Curtis?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What?
text: He stops and checks his watch.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm late.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You didn't eat anything?
text: Heading out.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It's okay.
text: Curtis is gone. Samantha looks at Hannah on the floor with
dialog: the dog.
dialog: 12.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. DELTA AGRI-PRO MAIN OFFICE - DAY
text: The main headquarters of Delta Agri-Pro is housed in a giant
text: metal building. A row of cheaply built, 70's style offices
text: with drop tile ceilings line the left of a large warehouse
dialog: that contains all manner of agricultural and construction
dialog: equipment. Tractors, backhoes, welding rigs, etc.
text: A GROUP OF MEN, many of which were represented at Gator's bar
dialog: yesterday, sit in folding chairs or stand in a semi-circle
text: around JIM THOMPSON(53). He speaks, clipboard in hand.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I didn't say you had control over
dialog: the weather Russell, what I did say
dialog: was that the top shelf has to be
dialog: cleared by the 15th. That's non-
dialog: negotiable.
text: Dewart eats from a bag of Sunflower seeds. Curtis stares
text: down at his forearm. He rubs the skin there. Jim runs a
text: finger down his clipboard.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Umm, Curtis. Where we at on that
dialog: east 82nd site?
text: Curtis snaps his head up, takes a second.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yesterday slowed us down. We
dialog: couldn't get the second pilot hole
dialog: drilled.
text: Jim drops his head and the clipboard falls to his side. A
text: melodramatic move.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It rained for two hours yesterday.
dialog: Two hours and our entire schedule
dialog: went in the toilet. We lose the
dialog: permit if you're not out of there
dialog: by end of day.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: End of day Curtis.
text: Curtis nods.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: All right. Valerie tells me that
dialog: the father son pancake cook off...
dialog: 13.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. DELTA AGRI-PRO MAIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Curtis and Dewart walk to Curtis' truck.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hey, I gotta make a stop before we
dialog: head out there.
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: Think we got time?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah. There's time.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY
text: Dewart stands by a flatbed cart with a prefab DOGHOUSE
text: sitting on it.
text: Curtis loads chain-link fencing materials onto the cart.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY
text: The wheels of the well-drilling rig are half sunk into the
text: muddy soil.
text: Curtis stands over the hole being drilled. The turning metal
text: pole suddenly seizes up and stops. Smoke begins to seep up
text: from the hole.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Sonofabitch.
text: Dewart jumps down from the control panel to take a look.
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: We stripped that bit.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah. Well, bring it up. We gotta
dialog: re-set it.
text: Dewart walks back to his controls. Curtis heads to the cab
text: of the drilling rig and checks his watch.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
text: Something catches his eye in the distance. Clearing past the
text: rig, he walks out into the adjacent field.
text: He removes his goggles, eyes fixed on the acres of farmland
text: that stretch for miles in front of him.
dialog: In the sky overhead,
dialog: 14.
text: 
text: AN ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS ROLL IN UNISON.
text: Hundreds of them make up a black swarm that twists and shifts
text: in the air. They dive bomb then ascend in intricate,
text: GEOMETRIC patterns.
text: Curtis watches, mesmerized.
text: Dewart strains a wrench against a bolt as the drill screeches
text: in reverse.
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: Curtis!
text: Curtis acknowledges Dewart but can't take his eyes off the
text: pattern of birds. They shrink and stretch from thick clumps
text: to long cylindrical tubes. A choreography.
text: Curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig, which is shrieking
text: with the SOUND of metal on metal.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You ever see birds fly like that?!
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: (holding his hand to his
dialog: EAR)
dialog: What?!
text: Curtis looks back, giving the birds a final review.
text: 
scene_heading: I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/HOUSE - EVENING
text: The sun has just set adding a purple hue to the sky. Curtis
text: steers his truck up to the front curb of his house.
text: THROUGH HIS WINDSHIELD,
text: He sees Samantha standing by her car, the back door open.
text: She watches him pull up. Hannah is already packed into her
text: car seat.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Shit.
text: PARKED,
text: Curtis climbs out and walks to the driveway.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Come on we gotta go.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Ah, Jesus. I could really use a
dialog: shower.
dialog: 15.
text: 
text: Samantha isn't having it. She climbs in the passenger seat.
text: Curtis makes his way to her car.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM - NIGHT
text: Curtis' work boots are encased in dry mud. Chunks have
text: broken off and pepper the thin blue industrial carpet. His
text: mud-stained fingers tap on the top of a desk. Dirt caked
text: under his nails.
speaker_heading: TEACHER (O.S.)
dialog: So if you continue with the basic
dialog: vocabulary, this will allow you to
dialog: communicate with your children
dialog: better.
text: Curtis sits, filthy, at a school desk he doesn't quite fit
text: into. A TEACHER speaks to a ROOM FULL of PARENTS.
speaker_heading: TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Between the ages of four and seven
text: the focus is more on the sign and
dialog: then later we'll begin adding the
dialog: alphabet as more of a support
dialog: syster. Now in ASL...
text: Curtis looks over at Samantha, who is sitting in the desk
text: next to him. She won't look at him.
text: He cranes his neck around to see toward the back of the room.
text: An ASSISTANT TEACHER sits on a large, colorful rug with a
text: GROUP of CHILDREN, all different ages, playing games that
text: teach hand signs. Hannah actively participates in the group.
speaker_heading: TEACHER (CONT'D)
text: ...the male sign is signed at the
dialog: forehead area. For example, father
dialog: is signed up here like
dialog: this...Father, very good.
text: Curtis turns back in his chair and makes the sign for "dad"
dialog: along with the other parents.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM - NIGHT - LATER
text: Curtis, Samantha, and Hannah sit on the floor in a circle
text: atop the colored rug.
text: Samantha turns over large flashcards with illustrated scenes
text: on them. They take turns making the corresponding sign.
text: Curtis stares at Samantha, but she's still giving him the
text: cold shoulder. Finally, while holding up a card, she looks
text: at him. He signs, "I'm sorry". A fist moving in a circular
text: motion at his chest.
dialog: 16.
text: 
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You're not sorry.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I am sorry.
text: She looks to Hannah and signs, "swim".
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Well, you stink. You smell really
dialog: bad.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I think I smell good.
text: She smiles, begrudgingly, and then signs to Hannah, "Dad" and
text: "stink". Curtis turns to some ladies behind him.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Do I smell good?
text: Samantha laughs and tries to cover his mouth with her hand.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: See. Maybe I should marry her
dialog: instead.
text: They continue to laugh.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Stop.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. CURTIS' TRUCK - DAY
text: Curtis slams the door to his truck, sealing him off from the
text: torrential rainfall outside.
text: He shakes water off, wipes his face. The windows are smeared
text: by thick, dark rain. It's hard to see out.
text: He looks over to Hannah sitting in her car seat. It looks
text: odd on the front bench of the truck. He signs to her.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (signing and speaking)
dialog: You okay?
text: She nods. He cranks the truck and turns on the wipers. The
text: liquid on the windshield streaks into long smudges. Curtis
text: leans forward to get a better view of the street. He checks
text: his blind spot and pulls away.
text: MOVING FAST ON A MAIN ROAD,
dialog: 17.
text: 
text: Stop lights blur into hazy red and green spheres.
text: Curtis checks the rearview, but the back window is covered by
text: the rain. He tries rolling down his window, but water blows
text: in. He rolls it back up and the smudging gets worse.
text: The truck shimmies from left to right, pushed by the wind. A
text: THUNDER STRIKE rattles.
dialog: Suddenly,
text: THE SHAPE OF A PERSON STANDING IN THE ROAD.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: SHIT!
text: Curtis stomps on the brakes and turns the wheel. The truck
dialog: hydroplanes.
text: CRASH! Curtis' head busts against the steering column. The
text: front windshield cracks as the truck jerks to a stop.
text: The HISS of a broken radiator. Curtis winces from the blow
text: to his head. Hannah is crying. He reaches over to her.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Hannah physically looks all right, but she continues crying.
text: Curtis reaches out and places a hand on her head. He's
text: dazed, mumbling.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You're okay.
text: The truck is angled up slightly like the front end has inched
text: up a pole. A cut on his forehead has begun to bleed.
text: He sees movement. A PERSON passes by the hazy side window.
text: A SHAPE moves past the driver's window.
text: The truck shifts as weight is added to the bed. The SOUND of
text: SOMEONE pulling things from the back of the truck. A moment.
text: WHACK! Curtis flinches as a 2X4 pounds the windshield.
text: The truck jostles from the weight of someone jumping on the
text: hood.
dialog: Bump. Bump.
text: The roof caves in with two FOOTSTEPS.
text: Curtis looks around frantically. He reaches over to Hannah
text: and begins to unstrap her from the car seat.
dialog: 18.
text: 
text: SMASH! A BOARD breaks through the Passenger Window.
text: A WOMAN, pale and aggressive, stands in the rain storm
text: staring through the broken glass. She reaches for the lock.
text: Curtis pulls Hannah from the child seat and recoils against
text: his door but is jolted as another board CRASHES through the
text: driver's window.
text: A HAND yanks Curtis by his collar. He's pulled against the
text: door. A pasty forearm wraps around his neck, choking him.
text: He strains against the arm. Sucks air. Needing to breath.
text: The Woman at the passenger door grabs for Hannah. Curtis
text: kicks at her.
text: A MAN's boot KICKS OUT the back window. The Man in the bed
text: of the truck reaches for Curtis' face. He flails and kicks,
text: unable to break free from the forearm at his door.
text: The Woman gets hold of Hannah. The child is yanked from
text: Curtis' arms. He screams.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hannah! Hannah!
text: Hands claw at Curtis' face. Scratching. Blood streaks. The
text: Woman has disappeared into the storm with Hannah.
text: Curtis screams. Fingers swoop into his open mouth, grabbing
text: hold of his cheek. They pull the cheek back. TEARING.
text: He yells in pain.

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/KITCHEN - DAY
text: Samantha walks down the hallway holding Hannah's shoes.
text: Hannah trails behind her.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Here honey. Put on your shoes
text: IN THE KITCHEN,
text: Samantha walks in. Curtis is standing at the counter in his
text: undershirt and boxers pouring a cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Good, you're up.
text: Curtis doesn't turn to greet her. He just stirs a spoon in
text: the black coffee.
text: Samantha walks up to him and puts a hand on his back. She
text: notices that his shirt is soaked with sweat.
dialog: 19.
text: 
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Honey, you're soaked.

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you sick?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I've felt better.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I guess we could stay home if we

speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: It's Saturday, I was going to take

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Oh. Yeah.
text: Curtis walks to the table and takes a seat.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You look really sick honey.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I'm all right. It's just a cold or

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: CURTIS

text: 
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Okay. I got my phone if you need
dialog: anything. Don't forget Sunday

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I'll be all right.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

dialog: Come on. Let's go.
dialog: (TO CURTIS)
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Honey, please.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Okay.
text: Samantha scoops up her bag and takes Hannah by the hand. They

text: Curtis notices the dog, Red, sitting on his haunches looking

text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - DAY
text: The reverse lights shine as Curtis' pick-up rumbles backward.
text: Curtis eyes the side mirror as he maneuvers the truck into
text: his backyard. In the mirror, the trash pile comes into view.
text: Just behind it, the STORM SHELTER doors appear.
text: The truck shutters to a stop. Curtis studies the Shelter in
text: the side mirror for a moment. A grassy bulge with angled
text: metal doors peeking over the trash heap. He climbs out.
text: A blue tarp is pulled from the bed of the truck, floating
text: down to the yard.
text: Curtis slips on a pair of work gloves and continues to eye
text: the Storm Shelter. He yanks a bale of chain-link from the
text: bed of the truck and carries it to the back corner of the
text: yard. He steals another glance back toward the Shelter.
dialog: 21.
text: 
text: Dropping the bale, he sizes up the space. He looks to the
text: sky. It's a beautiful day.
text: He begins counting off steps from the back fence line.

text: -A tackle box is opened revealing a tray of small bills and

text: Hannah kneels in front of a folding chair behind their BOOTH
text: at an open-air flea market. She uses the seat of the chair
text: as a table for a tiny porcelain tea set.
text: Samantha stands over her display table smiling and nodding at

text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - SERIES OF IMAGES - DAY

text: -Chain-link is attached to the stakes with a number of metal

text: -The prefab DOGHOUSE is set down in the back corner.
text: Curtis stands in front of his newly created dog pen. It's

dialog: of the yard so that half of the pen is made up by the
text: existing fencing.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. FLEA MARKET - DAY
text: Samantha turns to see a large woman holding up an intricately
text: embroidered pillow.
text: You can tell by the look of her that she's a flea market pro,
text: a BARGAIN HUNTER(54).
speaker_heading: BARGAIN HUNTER
dialog: How much you asking for this
dialog: pillow?
dialog: 22.
text: 
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: This pillow's fifteen dollars.
speaker_heading: BARGAIN HUNTER
dialog: That's more than I want to spend.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
text: This is all hand stitched. It takes
dialog: a really long time. That's why I
dialog: charge that.
speaker_heading: BARGAIN HUNTER
dialog: I'll give you seven for it.
text: Samantha looks at the woman, who is almost daring her.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I can't go that low.
speaker_heading: BARGAIN HUNTER
dialog: Well that's my offer.
text: The woman sets down the pillow and begins looking over other
text: items on the table. Samantha bites the inside of her cheek.
dialog: She doesn't like to haggle.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: How about 10?
text: The woman doesn't look up.
speaker_heading: BARGAIN HUNTER
dialog: I'll give you eight, but it's in
dialog: change.
text: Samantha forces a smile and motions to Hannah.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: That's fine.
text: The woman smiles and removes a Ziplock bag of assorted coins
text: from her purse. Hannah takes the bag.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Lucky for you she likes to count
dialog: change.
text: Hannah opens the bag and begins to turn it over.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - DAY - LATER
text: Curtis unlatches a piece of the braided wire holding a
text: separated section of fencing that acts like a gate.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Red! Come on.
dialog: 23.
text: 
text: He opens it and looks down at Red, who sits at his feet. He
text: speaks gently to the dog.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Get in.
text: Red walks into the pen.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Good boy.
text: Curtis closes the gate, kneels and places his hands on the
text: fence. Red approaches so that his nose is touching Curtis'
text: fingers. Curtis scratches him.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry about this buddy. We
dialog: just gotta work it like this for
dialog: awhile okay?
text: Curtis stands, wiping his hands off on his jeans. He sees
text: the Storm Shelter poking up from behind the trash pile. He
text: looks down at Red.
text: Curtis walks to the Shelter. Clearing past the trash pile,
text: the shelter appears, the mound fully visible.
text: Curtis stops at the angled doors. He studies them. A rusted
text: padlock is snapped shut across the handles. He reaches out
text: and lifts up the padlock. He yanks on it, then lets it fall.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Coins splash across the kitchen counter. Curtis sets an
text: empty coffee can back on the shelf in front of him and begins
text: sifting through the change.
text: Odd screws, buttons, then he gets to what he's looking for.
text: A small set of brass keys on a matching ring. He grabs the
text: keys from the pile and exits.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Curtis walks back out to the storm shelter, keys in hand,
text: long flashlight in his back pocket.
text: He pulls up the padlock that holds the two rusted doors
text: together. Popping off the rubber cover, he tries a key. The
text: lock pops up. He unhooks it from the doors and lets it fall
text: to the ground.
text: Curtis strains to pull the first door open. It's heavy and
text: sticks from lack of use. Finally, with a creak, the door
text: swings back.
dialog: 24.
text: 
text: Curtis holds his head to the side, a musty odor coming from
text: inside. He forces the second door open.
text: Curtis stands in front of the shelter, a gaping black hole
text: angled up from the earth.
text: He takes the flashlight from his pocket and turns it on. It
text: illuminates concrete steps leading down.
text: The dog, nose at the fence, watches from his pen on the other
text: side of the yard.
text: Curtis enters the shelter.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. STORM SHELTER - CONTINUOUS
text: It's pitch black inside. Curtis makes his way down the steps
text: and holds out the flashlight. An assortment of trash on the
text: ground, empty cans and water bottles, some candy wrappers.
text: The whole shelter is only about 6' X 8'. His head fits fine,
text: but he still ducks like he might bump it.
text: He shines the light on the back wall. A rotted, wooden bench
text: is bolted into the concrete there. Curtis walks to it and
text: takes a seat.
text: He's looking back toward the steps now. A shaft of light
text: cuts a strict beam through the open doors, lighting only the
text: concrete entry.
text: Curtis takes in the quiet of the concrete box. He leans his
text: head back on the wall and closes his eyes.
text: He shuts off his flashlight. Left in the dark, he takes a
text: deep breath. Exhales slowly.

text: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Samantha takes a TIN down from the top of the fridge. It has

text: 
text: She sets the tin on the counter next to the tackle box she

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: But that's what I don't understand.
dialog: If he didn't do anything why did
dialog: you put him out back?
text: Samantha counts out the money earned at the flea market. She

text: something, but it's inaudible.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
text: She opens the tin and removes an envelope with the word
text: "BEACH" written on it in black sharpie. Samantha adds the

text: 
text: 
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear me? I said if he didn't

text: Curtis' attention is on the TV. Samantha sits on the couch.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I just wanted him to be outside for
dialog: awhile.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: He's your dog. He's always been an

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: He's my dog, and that's why he's

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: It's awful.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Eleven hours. No way out.

text: 
scene_heading: INT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY
text: It's daytime, but the house feels dark from the storm blowing
text: outside. The SOUND of rain pelts the windows and roof.
text: Curtis, dressed for work, walks from his bedroom down the
text: hallway. He passes the den and stops at its entryway.
text: IN THE DEN,
text: Hannah sits on the couch with her back to him. She's on her
text: knees looking out one of the front windows.
text: A dull orange glow halos from the bank of windows. What
text: sunlight there is appears diffused by the dark, thick rain
text: smearing down the outside of the glass.
text: A THUNDER STRIKE.
dialog: 27.
text: 
text: Curtis flinches. He shows concern as heavier rain begins
text: battering the house. The wind picks up making wood beams
text: creak on their foundation.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hannah.
text: Hannah doesn't move. She continues staring out the window.
text: The SOUND of the storm outside intensifies. Windows begin to
text: rattle in their frames.
text: Curtis walks over and reaches for Hannah but is startled by
text: the sight of a MAN'S FACE just outside the window. Hannah
text: and the Man have been staring at one another.
text: The Man, hollow eyed and pale, moves out of the window and
text: out of sight.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey!
text: Thunder CRACKS overhead. Curtis scoops Hannah into his arms
text: and heads out of the room.
text: BANG. The front door rattles. Curtis stops and turns back.
text: BANG. BANG. The SOUND of someone kicking at the front door.
text: The storm outside has grown to a deafening pitch.
text: The power goes out.
text: The entire house vibrates, like a freight train running
text: across the roof. The BANGING at the front door continues,
text: frame giving way, as the STORM reaches its apex.
text: Curtis, holding Hannah, kneels and braces himself in the
text: entryway to the den. He covers the back of Hannah's head
text: with his hands and squeezes her tight into his shoulder.
text: Then Silence. A stillness.
text: The rain stops. No more banging at the front door. The SUN
text: moves brightly though the front windows.
speaker_heading: WOOSH.
text: The furniture in the den lifts off the ground. A couch,
text: Lazyboy, coffee table and lamp. It all hangs in the air,
text: floating for a moment. Quietly.
text: Curtis watches, eyes wide. A rumbling. Grows. The SUNLIGHT
text: vanishes.
text: SMASH! The sound of the storm is sucked back into the room as
text: the furniture crashes to the floor, breaking apart on impact.
dialog: 28.
text: 
text: The windows BLOW OUT.
text: Curtis squeezes his eyes shut and pivots his body, trying to
text: protect Hannah. Shards of glass splinter across his face.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Curtis gasps for air. It doesn't come.
text: Gasp. He's sucking for a breath. Hyperventilating.
text: He rises up in bed, gasping. His face flushed and head
text: soaked in sweat. His eyes dart around the room, frantically
text: searching his surroundings.
text: One more gasp, and air enters his lungs. He coughs. More
text: air. Long, deep breaths. He's calming down.
text: His breathing comes under control. His attention turns to
text: something else. Something under the sheets.
text: Curtis pulls back the bed sheets. The mattress is soaked in
text: YELLOW urine. This scares him.
text: His hand trembles as he reaches out to touch his wet boxers.
text: The toilet FLUSHES. Footsteps in heels.
text: Curtis quickly pulls the covers back up. Samantha enters the

text: Kneeling in front of her, Curtis shows her the book and
text: motions with open hands to the ground.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You stay put okay?
text: Hannah begins looking through the book. Curtis stands, he

text: AT THE COMPUTERS,
text: Curtis takes a seat in front of one of the two computers set
text: up on a folding table. He eyes the search screen. Title,
dialog: Author, Subject.
text: He clicks on "Subject" and types the word "DREAMS". He
text: scrolls through a list of titles and writes down a number.
text: He looks back for Hannah. She's still flipping through her

text: He begins another search. He types "MENTAL ILLNESS".
text: AT THE BOOK SHELVES,

dialog: You're not sleepin' at all?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Well some, but real restless.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR SHANNAN
dialog: Well, I think four nights is a

dialog: Cut back on any alcoholic drinks,
dialog: tobacco, caffeine...get some daily
dialog: exercise.
dialog: 36.
text: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Well, I think...
text: Curtis isn't sure how much he wants to say.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I may need to try some
dialog: medication.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR SHANNAN
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (STILL RELUCTANT)
dialog: The reason I've been having trouble
dialog: sleeping is because of some dreams
dialog: I've been havin'. I didn't think
dialog: it was anything at first, but then
dialog: the other day I woke up and the bed
dialog: was wet.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR SHANNAN
dialog: You urinated in your bed?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah. Couple days before that I

speaker_heading: DOCTOR SHANNAN

dialog: It's been about a month.
text: He tears two sheets off and holds the first out to Curtis.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR SHANNAN
dialog: Okay. This is a prescription for a

dialog: Take it and see if it helps. In
dialog: the meantime,
dialog: (holds up the other slip)
dialog: This is the number of a good friend

speaker_heading: CURTIS

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

text: and cups it in his palm.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Oh, honey. Look at this one. It's
text: a 2-1 and it sits directly on the

dialog: think you'd need?
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: Not a lot.
speaker_heading: CURTIS

text: Curtis flinches at the sound.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Dammit.
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: What?

speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: It sounds like thunder.
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: What sounds like thunder?
text: BOOM. ANOTHER THUNDER STRIKE.

text: MORE THUNDER. ROLLING NOW.
text: Curtis steps back from the rig and checks the horizons.
dialog: Nothing. It's a beautiful day.
text: Dewart looks down at him. Curtis' face is pale, scared.

speaker_heading: DEWART (CONT'D)
dialog: Where you goin'? Curtis. Where you
dialog: goin'?
text: BY CURTIS' TRUCK,
text: Curtis stops and rests his hands on the bed of the truck.
text: Another THUNDER STRIKE makes him flinch.
text: Curtis VOMITS next to the back tire.

text: 
scene_heading: I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/RURAL HIGHWAY - MOVING - DAY
text: Curtis studies his face in the rearview mirror as he sails
text: down the rural highway.
dialog: 44.
text: 
text: He rubs his eyes with the back of his hand and looks in the

text: Curtis begins to hyperventilate. Short breaths accompanied
text: by cold sweat. Sucking air. He can't breath. He panics.
text: The truck tires slide on the gravel shoulder as he abruptly
text: slams on the brakes and steers off the highway.
text: Dust settles outside as Curtis begins to get his breathing
text: under control. He rests his head on the steering wheel and
text: shuts his eyes tight.
text: Everything quiets down. His breathing. The road. No more
dialog: thunder.
text: Curtis looks out his passenger window.
text: His truck has stopped in front of a Tractor Trailer Depot. A

text: Curtis stares at this. He climbs out of the truck.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER DEPOT - CONTINUOUS
text: Curtis walks around his truck to get a better look at the

text: He studies the "FOR SALE" sign, then a smaller sign next to
dialog: it that lists available sizes.
text: Curtis turns back to his truck and rubs his face, still

speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)

dialog: all started. Before you had to
dialog: leave.
text: Sarah settles in her chair, understanding the question.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh, I don't know. I remember it

speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: May I have the number for Doctor

text: He begins to outline a rectangle.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. DEN - NIGHT
text: The house is quiet and the den is lit by a single lamp.

text: 
scene_heading: INT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK OFFICE - DAY
text: Curtis blows into a Styrofoam cup and stares through the
text: blinds of an office window. Outside, a flag snaps at the top
text: of a pole next to the FIRST NATIONAL BANK sign.
text: He looks down at a NEWSPAPER laid out on an end table next to
text: him. He flips it over and studies the ads on the back. A
text: big one in the corner catches his eye.
text: It reads, "CUYAHOGA GUN AND KNIFE SHOW!" The ad lists items
dialog: for sell/trade: ...Tactical Gear, Gas Masks, Batons...
text: Curtis focuses in on the words "Gas Masks" and tears the ad
text: out. JOHN MYERS(34) enters with a set of papers in his hand.
text: Curtis quickly tucks the ad into his back pocket.
text: Myers takes a seat in one of two chairs in front of his desk
text: and looks over the papers. He takes a pen out of his pocket

dialog: 50.
text: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS

text: Myers nods, but he carries a look of concern. He confides.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: I gotta tell you Curtis, banks
dialog: aren't loaning money the way they
dialog: used to. We've got you a loan
dialog: today, but the interest rates are
dialog: variable and we have to tie it to
dialog: your house.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: That's fine.
text: Myers sits back, drawing the pen to his lips and tapping it.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Curtis, I've known you a long time.
dialog: We financed your house for you, two

speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: Okay.

scene_heading: I/E. SAMANTHA'S CAR/INTERSTATE - NIGHT
text: Curtis drives while Samantha and Hannah sleep in the back.

text: Curtis, seeing this, repositions to get a better look through
text: the window. It's horizontal lightning that appears to leap
text: from cloud to cloud. Well defined bolts that strobe the
text: night sky silhouetting towering thunderheads.
dialog: 56.
text: 
text: Curtis looks back to Samantha and Hannah, still asleep.
text: He pulls the car over to the shoulder of the interstate and

text: ON THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE,
text: Cars rush by as Curtis gently closes the car door. Keeping

text: It's a fantastic display of light. Hurried and intense. A

text: Curtis sees the traffic continuing to pass by at full speed.
speaker_heading: CURTIS

text: IN THE BACKYARD,

text: A 20 foot by 8 foot wide hole that is 10 feet deep sits in

text: Dewart leans against the propane tank in the back corner of

text: a pocket knife. Seeing Samantha, he waves a hand.
text: Curtis' head appears from the hole. He stops when he sees
text: Samantha. They stare at one another. He can see her
text: surprise. He continues up the ladder and walks over to her.
text: Dewart watches from the back of the yard.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hey. It's all right. Calm down.
text: Samantha takes Hannah into the house without saying a word.

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Not a word. You didn't say one

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Well I'm worried Curtis. How are

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I got a home improvement loan from
text: the bank.
text: Samantha is stunned. She stands and gets in his face.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: How could you do that without
dialog: talking to me? You know the

dialog: want to waste money on a stupid
dialog: tornado shelter?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I'm doin' it...I'm doin' it for us.
dialog: I know you don't understand.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

text: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: It's dark and quiet in the house. Samantha sleeps on her

text: Her head is jostled. More. The bed begins to vibrate. Her

text: He's having a SEIZURE.
text: Samantha reaches for him. Eyes closed, his body convulses
text: violently. Samantha quickly turns on a bedside lamp.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Curtis!
text: She touches his arms. A small amount of BLOOD begins to

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

text: Suddenly, the seizures stop. Curtis' body is still.
text: Samantha freezes.
text: His eyes open and he thrashes up in bed. Samantha jumps,
text: tripping and stumbling backward.
text: Curtis sucks short breaths into his lungs. His head darts
text: back and forth, eyes wild. He sees Samantha staring up at
text: him from the floor. He begins to calm down.
text: Curtis touches his mouth. Sees the blood there.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Honey?
text: Samantha stands up and goes over to him. She sits on the

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Honey? Are you okay?
text: Curtis slowly nods.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I'm sorry you fellows had to come

speaker_heading: EMT

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Curtis turns up a bottle of peroxide and swishes it in his

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I haven't been honest with you.
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: What's goin' on?
speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: And there's always this dark, thick

dialog: Sometimes they go after Hannah.
dialog: First one I had Red nearly chewed
dialog: through my arm.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: That's why you put him out back?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: What was the dream? Tonight.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It was Dewart. We were at the job
dialog: site. The storm started and
dialog: somethin' happened. His face. His
dialog: eyes were different. He came after
dialog: me with a pick ax. And we fought.
dialog: And he ran it through my leg.
text: Curtis zones out for a moment. Samantha says nothing.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's hard to explain, because it's
text: not just a dream. It's a feeling.
dialog: I'm afraid something might be
dialog: comin'. Something that's...not
dialog: right. I can not describe it. I
dialog: just need you to believe me.
text: Samantha's eyes are red. Her nose. She nods slightly and
text: dabs the tissue at the corner of her eye.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been to a counselor. I've
dialog: seen her a few times.

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: No, nothin' like that. He's a good

scene_heading: EXT. ARMY NAVY PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Curtis stands at the driver's door of his pick-up. The box
text: sits on the seat in front of him. He opens it and removes
text: one of the gas masks.
text: He stares into its vacant plastic eyes. He drops the mask
text: back into the box and shakes his head. Sighs, frustrated
dialog: with it all.
text: He checks over his shoulder, scans the parking lot.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - LATER
text: Curtis stands on top of the shipping container that rests in
text: the hole roughly a foot below the yard. Wearing tinted
text: goggles, he cuts a circular hole in the top of the container
text: with a small blowtorch.
text: The sparks stop and Curtis raises the goggles to inspect his
text: work. He kicks at the weld with the heel of his boot and the
text: metal falls into the container.
dialog: 68.
text: 
text: He sets down the torch and removes a roof turbine vent from a
text: cardboard box and holds it up next to the newly cut hole.
speaker_heading: KYLE (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell are you doin'?
text: Curtis smiles to himself. He turns to find KYLE(42) standing
text: at the edge of the hole. His hands are tucked into the back
text: of his jeans and he's sizing up the work.
text: Curtis steps off the roof of the shipping container onto
text: ground level. He holds out a hand and Kyle shakes it, never
text: taking his eyes off the unfinished shelter.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: What you got goin' on here?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Just addin' on to the storm

speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: CURTIS

text: There's a long silence shared between them.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Samantha called me.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I figured.
text: Curtis climbs back onto the shipping container and continues
dialog: installing the roof vent.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Called you to come tell me to quit?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: She called `cause she's worried.
dialog: Says you've been stressed out.
text: Curtis doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Uh, huh...Hey, look. You wanna come

dialog: That's fine. We'll have a beer and

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You can stop that shit right now.

speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: No. I've got it.
text: Kyle nods.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Okay. Call me if you need me okay?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I will.
text: Kyle looks at him for a moment. He turns and walks toward

speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey Kyle?
text: Kyle turns back. Curtis climbs onto the yard and walks over
text: to him.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Actually you could do me a favor.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 71.
text: 
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You still looking for a dog?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Sure.
text: Kyle looks at him.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE HOME/DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: Curtis slaps down the tailgate to Kyle's truck, which is
text: parked in the driveway. Red, tail wagging, hops up into the
text: bed. Curtis closes the tailgate and sets a leash and two
text: bowls into the back of the truck.
text: Curtis rubs Red behind the ears.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: They got a good spot for you, okay

text: Kyle stands at the passenger door to the truck.

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Take care of yourself.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: All right. All right. I will little

dialog: 72.
text: 
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: All right.

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Hannah, fresh from the tub, stands to let Curtis rub her wet
text: head with a towel. He finishes and stands.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: All right. Bedtime.
text: Hannah looks up at him. Curtis signs his hand like a pillow
text: then touches his watch. They move out of the bathroom.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. LAFORCHE HOME/BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Curtis sits on the edge of his bed staring at the window in
text: their room. He's already dressed for work.
text: He watches as the thick, dark rain hits the window and

text: MOVING, down the hall.
text: MOVING, past the den.
text: MOVING, into the kitchen.
text: Curtis stops at the entry to the kitchen. Samantha, wearing

dialog: at the stove.
text: Curtis notices the back door standing open. HARD RAIN slants
text: down outside. He looks down at the tile floor.
text: WET FOOTPRINTS track inside.
text: They lead to where Samantha is standing. She turns to him.
text: She's pale with a vacant look on her face. Her hair is
text: soaking wet.
text: Curtis looks at her, concerned. She stares back,
text: emotionless. She slowly looks down at the counter next to
text: her. A kitchen knife rests there.
text: Curtis looks at the knife. They look at one another again.
dialog: 73.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Curtis sits at the breakfast table across from Hannah. He

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You okay?
text: She touches his hand. Curtis FLINCHES.
text: Their eyes meet. He wants to take it back, and she can see

text: Hannah vocalizes something behind them.
text: Samantha looks at her husband, shakes her head in disbelief.
text: Hannah makes another sound, pounds on the back door.
text: Samantha turns and sees a MAN standing in their backyard.

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Curtis. Dewart told me you took

dialog: at your house. Said that's why you
dialog: wanted him off your crew. I came

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah. It was just a hauler and a

speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)

dialog: do whatever I can to make it right.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You can pick up your last check on

text: Curtis nods. Accepts it.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Did you fire Dewart?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: He's on two weeks leave unpaid...
dialog: I'm sorry Curtis. You did this to
dialog: yourself.
text: Jim turns and walks out of the backyard.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CURTIS

text: doesn't look up.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: What about the health insurance?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: We get two more weeks.

speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry...
text: ...and SLAPS him across the face.

dialog: What happened to Kendra?
speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: ANDY

scene_heading: INT. STORM SHELTER - DAY
text: Curtis hefts a porcelain toilet down the steps of the

text: Curtis goes through it.
text: IN THE SHIPPING CONTAINER SECTION,
text: Curtis sets the toilet on the floor. He picks up the camping
text: lantern and holds it up to the space.
text: The lack of light makes it feel more cavernous than it is.
text: Two cots have been brought down as well as an assortment of
text: supplies. Canned food, a small gas burner.
text: Curtis hangs the lantern onto a hook on the wall and goes
text: about connecting the toilet to a pipe sticking out of the
text: back corner.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY
text: Samantha walks inside followed by Hannah and a WOMAN from the

text: before placing the empty envelope back in the tin.
text: She looks out back and sees Curtis sitting with Hannah.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE,
text: The shipping container has been covered over with dirt. Two

speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You gonna leave me?
text: Samantha looks at his hands. They hang by his sides.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You flinched when I touched your

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I was in one of your dreams?
text: Curtis nods.
speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Can you deal with that?
text: He holds open his hand to her. She takes it.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

dialog: two months with your last check.
dialog: I'm going to get a job. You're
dialog: gonna find another job. I'm going
dialog: to call to see if we can move

speaker_heading: CURTIS

scene_heading: INT. LIONS CLUB LODGE - NIGHT
text: The inside of the club is a musty banquet hall with wood

speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Curtis.
speaker_heading: DEWART
dialog: I told people what you been doin'.
speaker_heading: CURTIS

text: heading for him.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: STOP IT DEWART!
text: Curtis stands and kicks Dewart in the knee. It buckles back

speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Sleep well in your beds. Cause if

text: 
text: Samantha, leading Hannah by the hand, walks to Curtis. He

scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY

text: in the distance. He notices Hannah is gone.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Hannah?
text: He pulls his head out from the hood and sees Hannah standing

speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hannah!
text: A FLOCK OF BIRDS, flying in intricate geometric patterns,
text: swarm above the house at the end of the street. They twist
text: and bend into speckled black shapes.
text: Hannah, watching, walks into the street. Curtis catches her
text: by the hand. He turns away from the birds to see a STORM
text: CELL building on the opposite horizon. He scoops Hannah into
text: his arms, stepping back from it.
text: The SOUND of the birds grows louder. Curtis pivots to find
text: the mass of birds barreling down the street toward him. He
text: turns away as the wall of birds crash past him. The force so
text: powerful it knocks him backward.
text: He covers Hannah's head, dodging the onslaught of wind and
text: wings. The Flock passes. Curtis stands, his face cut and
text: scraped. Hannah cries, clinging to his chest.
dialog: SMASH!
text: The windshield of a car parked next to him SHATTERS. Curtis
text: looks at the broken glass. A dead bird, it's neck broken,

dialog: SMACK!
dialog: 83.
text: 
text: Another bird crashes into the asphalt just in front of him.
text: Then another. Curtis looks up. The Flock of birds are

scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Wind blows fiercely as pellets of hail bounce off the ground.
text: Rain cuts at a sharp angle. The Tornado Sirens continue.
text: Curtis, Hannah in his arms and Samantha close behind, exits
text: the back of the house and heads to the storm shelter. He
text: passes Hannah to Samantha and fumbles with the padlock keys.
text: At the doors to the shelter, Samantha holds her robe up to

text: 
scene_heading: INT. STORM SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Come on. It's okay.

speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay. All right. Come on. Sit
dialog: down.

text: He goes over and kneels in front of Hannah. He tries

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: No. Don't do that.
speaker_heading: CURTIS

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Are you kidding?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Please just do it. Okay?
text: He looks to Hannah and places an oxygen mask over her face..
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: There we go. All right. Keep it out
dialog: of your eyes. Okay?
text: He signs to her.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. I love you. It's okay.
text: Curtis eases on the knob at the top of the tank.
text: He climbs onto the cot and puts his arm around them. He
text: slips on his gas mask.
text: Samantha is hesitant. She looks at her husband in the mask
text: and leans back against the side of the container. Hannah
text: looks up at her. She touches her mother's mask.
text: Samantha slips on the gas mask.
dialog: 85.
text: 
text: The camping lantern on the floor casts long shadows up. The
text: faint boom of thunder rolls softly outside.
text: The family sits huddled together on the cot, wearing their
dialog: masks.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. STORM SHELTER - LATER
text: A CRACK of thunder rattles the shelter. Curtis snaps awake,
text: still wearing his gas mask.
text: Samantha has climbed on the other cot and is asleep. Hannah
text: sleeps under Curtis' arm. He gently lays her down on the cot
text: and stands to stretch.
text: He walks into the original section of the shelter and grabs a
text: small flashlight off the metal shelving. He clicks it on and
text: moves over to the concrete steps.
text: He takes a seat and listens. He places his hand onto the
text: metal door. A BOOM of thunder.
text: He can hear the rain and wind blowing outside.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. STORM SHELTER - LATER
text: Samantha rubs Curtis' shoulder, gently waking him.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Wake up babe.
text: Curtis' head moves. He sees that Samantha and Hannah have
text: removed their masks.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Where's your mask?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: We took them off. It's fine. Take
text: it off.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: No.
text: Curtis hesitates.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: We're fine. Take it off.
text: Curtis slips the mask off his face. Worried, he takes a
text: breath.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: You need to open the door now.
dialog: 86.
text: 
text: Curtis doesn't move. He looks at them.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (MUMBLES)
dialog: What if it's...What if it's not
dialog: over?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: What if it's not over?
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: It's over. Get the keys. Open the
text: door.
text: Curtis slowly gets to his feet. He sees the dark entryway to
text: the original section of the shelter. Taking the lantern, he
text: walks to it.
text: Samantha and Hannah follow.
text: Curtis stops just inside. He holds the lantern up,
text: illuminating the padlocked metal doors.
text: He looks back at his family, then climbs the steps. He
text: places his hand on the door. He flinches.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
text: It's still storming.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: No. It's not.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I can hear it.
text: Samantha stares at him. The room is silent.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I don't hear anything.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Put your hand on the door. You can
dialog: feel it.
text: He takes Samantha's wrist and guides her to the doors. He
text: watches her face as she places a hand against the metal. She
text: looks at him, her eyes getting red, and shakes her head "no".
text: Curtis kneels in front of Hannah and mimics the signs from
dialog: earlier.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (signing and speaking)
dialog: Thunder? Do you feel it?
dialog: 87.
text: 
text: He flinches again. Looks to the ceiling
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (signing and speaking)
dialog: You feel it? You feel it?
text: Hannah walks to her mother. Samantha holds onto her.
text: Curtis steps back from them. They watch him, their backs to
text: the doors. He flinches and covers his mouth.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Baby, there's no storm outside.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Samantha walks over to him.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Curtis. I wouldn't lie to you. We
dialog: love you very much. Please open
text: the door.
text: Curtis is on the verge of tears.
text: He slowly reaches into his jeans pocket. He removes the
text: keys. He holds them out to Samantha.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I'm sorry. I can't.
text: Samantha looks at the keys, then at Curtis. Tears shake from
text: his trembling face.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: I love you, but if I open the door,
dialog: then nothin's gonna change. You'll
dialog: see that everything's fine, but
dialog: nothing will change. Please. This
dialog: is what it means to stay with us.
dialog: This is something you have to do.
text: He looks at Hannah, then Samantha. Curtis steadies himself,
text: trying to control his flinching. He wipes his face with the
text: back of his hands and takes a deep breath.
text: Curtis walks toward the doors. On the steps, he reaches up
text: to the padlock. The keys shake in his fingers. He turns to
dialog: Samantha.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Could you move Hannah back?
dialog: 88.
text: 
text: Samantha picks Hannah up in her arms and Curtis watches them
text: retreat to the rear wall.
text: He goes back to the lock. He inserts the key. The padlock
text: pops open. Curtis removes it. He looks back at Samantha,
text: then flings open the doors.
text: SUNLIGHT.
text: It's blinding. Curtis holds his hand up to cover his eyes.
text: He stares up at a crystal blue sky. Samantha watches as
text: Curtis steps out of the shelter.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Curtis rises through the storm shelter's entryway. Out of
text: the corner of his eye he catches,
text: A MAN PASSING BY.
text: Curtis is startled. He turns to see a CREW of MEN from the
text: power company hoisting a ladder onto the pole at the corner
text: of the house. A power line dangles overhead.
text: He turns to see NEIGHBORS in their yards clearing debris.
text: Leaves and branches clutter the ground. The aftermath of a
dialog: storm.
text: Samantha steps out of the shelter holding Hannah. She
text: surveys the damage.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: It's fine.
text: She walks over to Curtis and hugs him. He kisses Samantha on
text: the head. Curtis looks up at the sky.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - DAY
text: Curtis sits with Samantha in the plush office of a
text: PSYCHIATRIST(56). Curtis rubs his hand over the soft leather
text: upholstery on the couch.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: Do you have any vacation time that
dialog: you could use?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: I don't have a job right now.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: Well, I know that times are hard,
dialog: but I think it's really important
dialog: for you to separate yourself from
dialog: that storm shelter.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: 89.
text: 
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST (CONT'D)
dialog: I think you need to break away from
dialog: it for awhile. We can start you on
dialog: some medication that I think will
dialog: help, but that action alone would
dialog: mean a lot.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: We usually go on a trip to Myrtle
dialog: Beach every summer. We were gonns
dialog: go this month.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: I think that would be okay if we
dialog: start the medication now. It would
dialog: give you all some time to prepare
dialog: as a family, but I want to be
dialog: clear, when Curtis gets back he'll
dialog: need to take more time than that.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: I mean that he'll need hands on
dialog: therapy at a real facility.
text: Curtis looks up for the first time.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: You mean I have to leave my family.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: I think you need to seriously
dialog: commit to some treatment.
text: Curtis processes this. Samantha takes his hand.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH/CONDO - DAY
text: Curtis scoops handfuls of sand out of a foot deep hole on the
text: beach. He slops the wet mixture into a castle shaped bucket,
text: his back to the shoreline of gentle, breaking waves.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: (signing and speaking)
dialog: Hey. Good, huh?
text: Hannah sits on her knees in front of Curtis sprinkling dry
text: sand over castle shaped mounds already formed.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. CONDO - DAY
text: Samantha drops four hotdogs into a boiling pot of water and
text: stirs a bubbling pot of canned chili.
dialog: 90.
text: 
text: The beach condo is small, but brightly furnished.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. CONDO/BEACH - DAY
text: The wooden deck hangs off the back of the beach condo. A
text: picnic table is set with plastic place mats and forks. WIND
text: lifts the corner of a stack of napkins. The wind blows
text: harder, fanning the napkins off the table.
text: ON THE BEACH,
text: Curtis, still working in the sand, puts a top on the sand
dialog: castle.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Good. We put a top on it.
text: Curtis smooths out the sand in the castle shaped bucket and
text: turns it over to top off their sand mound. He hands the
text: bucket over for Hannah to refill.
text: The SOUND of the waves behind them has STOPPED. They don't
text: notice.
text: Curtis takes two fingers and digs a small trench around the
dialog: sand castle.
text: 
text: Curtis looks up ready to sign the letters but sees Hannah
text: staring at the water. She looks at him and signs something
text: with her hands.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it honey?
text: Curtis misses it. He shakes his head, "no", and Hannah signs
text: again, slowly: "S-T-O-R-M".
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
text: Curtis turns to the shoreline, getting to his feet.
text: He looks down at Hannah, who watches, mesmerized. Scared,
text: she looks to her father. He grabs her under the arms and
text: rests her on his hip. She buries her head into his chest.
text: AT THE CONDO,
text: A gust of wind greets Samantha as she walks out onto the deck
text: holding a plate of hotdogs and a bowl of chili. She stops,
text: seeing the horizon. Her mouth falls open.
text: She slowly sets the plate and bowl down on the table, her
text: mind racing. She looks down at Curtis in disbelief.
dialog: 91.
text: 
text: Curtis looks up to the Condo and makes eye contact. He
text: studies her face.
text: Samantha looks at her husband, trying to process it all. She
text: looks out at the horizon then back down to Curtis. Concern
text: on her face, she nods to him.
text: Curtis sees her nod.
text: Samantha's eyes, still locked on Curtis, soften, as if to
text: apologize. After a moment, she mouths to him, "I love you."
text: Curtis nods back to her.
text: She looks back up to the shoreline.
text: ON THE BEACH,
text: Curtis' feet kick up sand as he rushes back toward the condo.
text: AT THE CONDO,
text: Samantha hasn't moved from the porch. A light rain begins to
text: fall. Her hands grip the railing. She turns her left palm
text: up. Dark rain collects there.
text: ON THE HORIZON IN FRONT OF HER,
text: THE WATER HAS RECEDED INTO THE GULF SOME 100 YARDS. THE DARK
text: SANDY BOTTOM LOOKS ODD STRETCHED OUT SO FAR. A STORM CELL
text: SITS MASSED ON THE HORIZON. CHURNING BLACK CLOUDS FILLED
text: WITH LAYERS OF HORIZONTAL LIGHTNING.
text: Behind Samantha, Curtis appears in the open sliding door
text: clutching Hannah. The Storm Cell is reflected in the glass
text: next to him.
speaker_heading: CURTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Sam.
text: Samantha looks down at her palm. She rubs the thick, viscous
text: rain in her fingers. She looks back up at the storm.
text: On Samantha's face,
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Okay.
text: THE END.
