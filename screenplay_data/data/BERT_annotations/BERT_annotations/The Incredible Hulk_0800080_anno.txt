text: BLACK: THE SOUND OF COLD WIND
scene_heading: EXT. DECK OF AN ICE-BREAKING TUG BOAT - ARCTIC SEA - DAY
text: A battered old rescue tug churns north through broken pack ice.
text: A MAN stands in the prow staring at the world of ice. A wasteland.
text: He signals up to CAPTAIN. The boat slows to a halt. The man
text: shoulders a small pack. He climbs over onto a ladder and descends
text: onto the frozen edge of the pack ice. He turns his back on the
text: boat and starts walking toward the distant shore.
text: The CAPTAIN stares at the receding figure, expressionless. He
text: pushes the throttle forward and the boat moves on.
scene_heading: EXT. GLACIER EDGE - DAY
text: Small in the frame the man trudges resolute toward nothing. The
text: wind starting to whip up.
text: He climbs through the maze of ice and rock to reach the plateau of
text: the glacier. He stops and shrugs off the pack, roots around and
text: takes something out, we can't see what. He unzips the parka and
text: puts the object in his waist and zips up and sets off again.
text: Incomprehensibly he leaves the pack behind.
scene_heading: EXT. PLATEAU OF THE GLACIER - DAY
text: The man has been walking a long time. He stops and looks around.
text: Ice. Mountains behind. The green-black of the sea out in front.
dialog: Not a human sign, no life at all. Except...
text: AN ARCTIC FOX, buried almost invisible, watching.
text: The man looks up at THE AURORA BOREALIS - eerie dancing sheets of
text: green and purple flowing across the sky.
text: Tighter on THE MAN’S FACE: looking up..hollowed out, haunted.
speaker_heading: MEMORY _FLASH:
text: A banshee shriek of sound. An image streaked liked a camera moved
text: on a slow shutter. A WOMAN’S BODY on the ground, FLAMES..but we
dialog: probably can't make it out.
scene_heading: EXT. GLACIER - DAY
text: THE MAN’S EYES: wide open. Anguish.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: He takes off the parka and throws it away from him and it is taken
text: by the wind. He falls to his knees, much too exposed now. He
text: stares forward at nothing, gathering his will.
text: And now we see the GUN in his waistband. His hand takes it and
text: points it down and into the snow but he stares ahead.
text: His thumb PULLS THE HAMMER BACK and the heartbeat starts to race.
text: From behind and to the side a bit: THE DULL PULSE OF A GREENISH
text: GLOW IN THE BASE OF HIS SKULL, beneath the edge of his cap.
text: EYES: flaring wide snapping from blue to DEEP GLOWING GREEN.
text: From behind him again: the hand with the gun JERKS UP -
text: THE FOX in the snow: a FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT on the white snow and
text: a muffled report of a GUNSHOT and the fox is gone...
text: From a distance: the man, hard to make out the figure from this
text: far away, hard to get a sense of scale.. still on the knees, head
text: bent, falling forward now but HIS ARM SHOOTS OUT TO CATCH HIM.
text: THE ARM: close on the forearm as it hits the snow, hand
scene_heading: outstretched. HUGE. MUSCLED. GREEN.
text: A clicking sound.metal on teeth..the hand rises toward the face out
text: of frame and the clicking stops. The hand lowers, open. A
text: MASSIVE FLAT PALM WITH A BULLET IN IT. Smashed completely flat.
text: A long beat with nothing but cold wind.
scene_heading: EXT. GLACIER SHELF - DAY
text: Wide: the cliff edge of the whole glacier shelf seen from out in
text: the water looking back.
text: In the wind: A SOUND. Was that a distant ROAR? A HOWL? The wind
dialog: took it away... and then...
text: BOOM: a huge dull reverberation echoing
text: And with it a HUGE PIECE OF THE GLACIER the size of an aircraft
text: carrier cleaves off the shelf and tumbles roaring into the sea.
text: A WAVE, the enormous tsunami ripple from the ice pounding into the
text: water.. we're at water level and it's coming toward us like a
dialog: freight train and over us and we're...
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - ARCTIC SEA - DAY

text: BRUCE BANNER is running. Up in the hills, past the fringes of the

text: He slows to check something on his wrist: A PULSE MONITOR
dialog: It shows: 90 Low for somebody running hard.
scene_heading: EXT. FAVELA STREET - MORNING
text: Banner walking now, anonymous in the teeming streets. Nondescript.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET MARKET - DAY
text: Banner stops at a market stall and picks up a package. He opens it
text: and takes out a BOOK. If we see it we will see that it is a book
text: of rare South American FLOWERS.
scene_heading: EXT. SHOPFRONT - STREET MARKET - DAY
text: Banner greets a SHOP-OWNER he’s friendly with. The man has a

scene_heading: EXT. MARTIAL ARTS STUDIO - DAY
text: BANNER enters a low building, a knapsack slung over his shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. AIKIDO STUDIO - DAY
text: Banner and an INSTRUCTOR train by themselves. Banner practices
text: deflecting aggressive energy and attacks without losing his
text: composure. Just as his instructor seems to be complimenting him
text: on a move and Banner relaxes, the instructor SLAPS him, hard.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: It surprises him and his PULSE beeps up a bit..over 80. But he
text: stays calm and nods, it's a test they practice. The instructor
text: nods and then SLAPS HIM HARDER and SHOVES him.. PULSE pegs up near
text: 100, Banner holds out a hand “Stop”. He takes a deep breath and
text: calms himself. The instructor's fingernail has scratched his
text: cheek. A DROP OF BLOOD oozing... He feels it and immediately dabs
text: it with a cloth from his bag. Then he pulls out a tube of CRAZY
text: GLUE and applies a little to the cut carefully. Puts the cloth in
dialog: his bag.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTLING PLANT - MORNING - (DAYS LATER)
text: The massive ungainly bulk of a Third World factory. BANNER enters

text: working and biding his time.
scene_heading: INT. BOTTLING PLANT —- CHANGING ROOM - DAY
text: The rough locker room of the male workers. Dirty walls, old
text: cracked floors naked bulb. Men pulling gloves and goggles out of
text: lockers, changing shirts. BANNER is among them.
text: FOUR YOUNG TOUGH GUYS are the most boisterous, one shoving the
text: other playfully, BUMPING BANNER slightly. They don’t apologize
text: but it doesn’t matter because he literally doesn’t even react.
scene_heading: INT. BOTTLING PLANT - FACTORY FLOOR - DAY
text: An enormous sprawling forest of machinery, steam pipes, conveyor
text: belts...all in a huge open floor with a high tin-roof ceiling. A
text: catwalk runs around the perimeter up above and across to the tops
dialog: of certain of the biggest machines.
text: BANNER works in the soda bottling plant. His job is rudimentary,
text: carrying supplies of bottle caps or bottles to the workers who man
text: the massive conveyor belts of bottles moving through the process:
text: GUARANA SODA flowing in from massive tanks, caps being sealed on,
dialog: labels being applied:
dialog: “BRMAZONA - with Guarana Kick!”
text: A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN smiles at BANNER as he delivers to her and he
text: smiles back but keeps moving, distant.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTLING PLANT - DELIVERY BAYS - DAY
text: Break time. Seen from a distance, BANNER is by the TRUCK DELIVERY
text: BAYS talking to a SUPPLY DRIVER, an INDIAN from the interior. We
text: can’t hear what they’re saying with the noise all around. The
text: driver has something wrapped in a tied-up leaf... he opens it to
dialog: show Banner...
text: We can’t see it very well, maybe a FLASH OF WHITE
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: But it seems to excite Banner. He has his BOOK...it’s more worn
text: than when he first received it... he opens to a marked
text: page...compares something in the book to what’s in the driver’s
dialog: leaf.
text: He looks up with a HINT OF A SMILE and nods. He takes out money
dialog: to pay the guy...he seems to be asking if the driver has more...
text: but the guy shakes his head.
scene_heading: INT. BOTTLING PLANT - DAY
text: Back at work: The MANAGER has a problem with the machine that
text: fills the soda from above the bottles ; he comes to Banner and we
dialog: can see that Banner speaks a little rough Portuguese.
text: Banner works on a machine, opening the back of one of those
text: “ON/OFF BUTTON” boxes, fixing frayed wires. The BOTTLES FLOW
text: BENEATH HIM ON THE CONVEYOR BELT. The manager likes him, but
text: can’t figure him out. He smiles.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (Portuguese)
dialog: I keep telling you...let me put you on
dialog: payroll. I can pay you what you’re worth!
text: Banner looks up and smiles and shakes his head and in doing so he
speaker_heading: CUTS HIS HAND.
text: c.U. - TWO DROPS OF BLOOD: fall toward the moving bottles.
dialog: BANNER: seeing this...sudden intensity, tracking it.. he MUST find
text: where the blood went. Tracking the bottles he thinks were under
text: him with his eyes...LOCKED on them.
text: He jumps down and starts moving along with the belt, trying hard
text: to track them, YELLING at his friend the manager to stop the belt...
text: The belt stops. BANNER MOVES ALONG IT SEARCHING. And he finds it:
text: a BLOOD SPOT on the conveyor belt. RELIEF. He wipes it off
text: carefully. Not noticing...
text: ANOTHER BOTTLE, with drops of blood dripping just inside the glass
text: lip, down into the soda. He signals “Okay” and the belt starts up
dialog: again.
text: BANNER: taking out the CRAZY GLUE again. Applying some to the
text: cut on the edge of his hand.
text: The MANAGER: laughs and shakes his head. This guy is unique.

scene_heading: INT. BANNER’S APARTMENT —- EVENING
dialog: We can see the details of his essential life, his work, the STRAY
text: DOG he feeds. Oblique details like rope tied to jam of kitchen
text: window and coiled neatly on counter. A Styrofoam head with a wig
text: of dark hair and a baseball cap on it. We notice these things
text: without emphasizing them. A low bed in the corner against a wall.
text: Not much else. He's living like a monk.
text: BANNER is entering, eager to get to work...
text: He sits at his roughly fashioned WORKTABLE. On it seems to be his
text: only possessions of note: rows of various SMALL GLASS BOTTLES
text: with liquid in them, neatly self-labeled and arranged in rows.
text: One DECENT LOOKING MICROSCOPE. A SMALL FIELD SATELLITE LINK
text: ANTENNA and a LAPTOP COMPUTER.
text: He turns on the SATELLITE LINK and the COMPUTER and starts to
dialog: Instant Message:
text: BANNER’S SCREEN: (Banner’s writing in Green, his collaborator’s in

dialog: “Mr. Blue?”
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: “Mr. Green...hello. Did you find what you were looking for?”
dialog: “Yes.”
dialog: “And you have my notes on derivation of the inhibitor?”
dialog: “Yes.”
dialog: “For most cellular exposures a concentration of 50-80 parts per
dialog: million will suffice. Keep me posted. And good luck :)”
dialog: And Banner begins to work:
scene_heading: MONTAGE: BANNER EXTRACTING A CHEMICAL FROM HIS FLOWERS
text: Over many hours, Banner works. Methodically and painstakingly
text: extracting tiny amounts of juice from his precious flowers, mixing
text: it carefully with chemicals from self-labeled bottles and mixing
text: it all in an assortment of glasses doubling as homemade test
text: tubes; cooking it down over a small gas flame. Referring to BLUE’s
text: NOTES on his computer.
text: Finally, all seems ready...a final step.
text: He PRICKS HIS OWN FINGER...so carefully placing ONE DROP of his
text: BLOOD on a glass slide. He slides it under the microscope and
dialog: looks at it:
scene_heading: C.U. - BANNER’S BLOOD: red blood cells fringed with a subtle
text: GLOWING GREEN ENERGY. Like residual radiation.
text: He takes the slide back out. Takes a breath. This is it.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: In a dropper, he extracts some of the PURPLISH LIQUID he has been
text: slowly refining from the very small amount in the glass.
text: Carefully he brings it over the blood sample... and squeezes ONE,
text: TWO THREE drops onto the blood.
text: He places the slide under the SCOPE and looks again:
text: C.U. - BLOOD: The Purple liquid seems to be literally boiling
text: away around the cells. Frying. No change. The GREEN TINGE is
dialog: still there.
text: BANNER pulls back from the scope and puts his forehead against the
text: heel of his hands. He had let himself hope and now he is
dialog: devastated.
speaker_heading: BANNER’S SCREEN:
dialog: Green: “No mitigation.”
dialog: Blue: “None? Your tissue exposure must be relatively high.”
dialog: Green: “Very high.
dialog: Blue: “Try a higher concentration. Slightly. 100 parts per million
dialog: = lethal toxicity.”
text: BANNER leans back and looks at: HIS WILTED FLOWERS. He has milked
dialog: them for all they have.
dialog: Green: “Impossible at present. Supply is limited.”
dialog: Blue: “Not here. We’re making pure synthetic by the gallon.”
dialog: (pause)
dialog: “Why are we doing this backwards? Chasing flowers in the jungle =
dialog: silly. Send me a blood sample.”
dialog: Green: “Not prudent.”
dialog: Blue: “Living with Gamma poisoning not prudent. Most people not
dialog: alive long enough to be helped. Intrigued by your case.”
dialog: Green: “Not safe for either of us.”
dialog: Blue: “You need help. Gamma not something to mess with.”
speaker_heading: BANNER
dialog: You can say that again.
text: He stares at his dead flowers long and hard. Out of options.
text: BANNER MOVES TO THE TABLE AND PROCEEDS TO EXTRACT A VIAL OF HIS
speaker_heading: OWN BLOOD.
text: He labels it “MR. GREEN”
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MARKET - DAY
text: At the PACKAGE STAND, sending the blood to Mr. Blue.
text: BANNER turns and starts away, stops and looks back...he’s taking a
text: big risk. But he has to. So he turns and walks home.

speaker_heading: BLONSKY

speaker_heading: CABOT
dialog: There’s rumors in the street about

speaker_heading: BLONSKY
dialog: That was no gorilla. It was 10 feet tall
dialog: and green...or gray. I couldn’t tell. But
dialog: it wasn’t an animal and you can’t tell me
dialog: that thing is hiding somewhere.
speaker_heading: ROSS

speaker_heading: BLONSKY
dialog: What about Banner?
speaker_heading: CABOT

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: That was Banner.
speaker_heading: CABOT
dialog: You think he led us into it?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: No I mean It...was Banner. It wasn’t an

speaker_heading: BLONSKY
dialog: You’re going to have to explain that

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: No, I’m not. You did your jobs well,

speaker_heading: BLONSKY

speaker_heading: ROSS

speaker_heading: BLONSKY

speaker_heading: BLONSKY
dialog: Super Soldier.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Yes...an oversimplification...but yes.
dialog: Across the hall they’re trying to arm you
dialog: better, we were trying to make you
dialog: better. In all the obvious ways and some
dialog: not so obvious. Banner’s work was very
dialog: early phase, it wasn’t even a weapons
dialog: application. It was radiation mitigation,
dialog: see if we could give our boys built in
dialog: insulation against all that depleted
dialog: uranium nobody likes talking about. It
dialog: was promising but politicians don’t give
dialog: a Flying F about what real soldiers need,
dialog: they like big twin rotor heli-planes that
dialog: don’t work that they can build in their
dialog: states... and so our money was running
dialog: out. Banner was so sure of what he was on
dialog: to that he tested it on himself. It was
dialog: supposed to be very low-exposure and
dialog: something went wrong. Or went very
dialog: right... I still don’t know.
speaker_heading: BLONSKY
dialog: Why did he rabbit on you?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Banner was brilliant, one ina
dialog: generation...but he is scientist, not one
dialog: of us. He doesn’t grasp that to have
dialog: peace and freedom you need Power. That
dialog: people like you and I need instruments to
dialog: do what we do.
speaker_heading: BLONSKY
dialog: So it’d be good to nail him sure, but why
dialog: not just take the data to someone else?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Because he IS the data. As far as I’m
text: concerned, that man’s whole body is
dialog: property of the US Army.
speaker_heading: BLONSKY
dialog: I have real contempt for people like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ROSS

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: It was very promising but none of it
dialog: panned out. Or, it did but it
dialog: was...unstable. Made the subjects
dialog: unstable. I wanted to refine it.. but
dialog: then Al-Haquid happened and Congress
dialog: killed it. No stomach.
speaker_heading: BLONSKY
dialog: You’1l need something special to go
dialog: against that thing. Someone who can
dialog: survive to learn how to fight it. I’d be
dialog: willing.

speaker_heading: BLONSKY
dialog: I don’t want to lead. I’m a fighter.
dialog: That’s all I want to be and I want to be
dialog: the best for as long as I can and I don’t
dialog: want to lose a step and if there’s
dialog: something I can take to give me an edge,
dialog: I want it.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Well, I’m glad to see that all that
dialog: advertising we do actually works. You
dialog: know when I came back from Vietnam I was

text: STAN MOVES AND BLOCKS HER VIEW...THEN MOVES AWAY AGAIN
dialog: AND BANNER IS GONE.
scene_heading: BETTY: FROZEN SHOCK
text: SAMSON'S MOUTH is moving but everything is SILENT. She stares at

scene_heading: EXT. REAR ALLEY OR PARKING LOT BEHIND THE PIZZA PARLOR

speaker_heading: BETTY
speaker_heading: BRUCE!
text: He stops but doesn’t turn and she moves toward him, still not able

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: WIDE looking at the shoulder of the road, RAIN pouring down... and

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: And trimethodine...
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I didn’t think you could synthesize an

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: We’re all a lot further along than we

dialog: on that score. He had some kind of ethics

dialog: didn’t stop him. His work is unbelievably
dialog: brilliant. So, Brazil for the corablanca?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: He’s synthesizing it but I had to try to

dialog: he’s even right...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: And now?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I go find him, I suppose. I don’t know if

speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No, you don’t.

speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: I got in there before they carted it all

speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: BANNER

speaker_heading: SAMSON
dialog: Cryptic. But I’ll take it at face value.
dialog: I’1l confess something to you if you’ll
dialog: clear up some things for me...First, I
dialog: confess, aS a man...as Betty’s lover...
dialog: that I have always hoped you were dead.
dialog: Not because I didn’t like you but because
dialog: I love Betty and I’ve known that unless
dialog: you were really gone, or she believed you
dialog: were, that there would always be three of
dialog: us in this relationship. I’ve dreaded
dialog: the thought of you walking through the
dialog: door. But now that you’re here...I have
dialog: to admit that I’m very happy about it.
dialog: Because I’m also a psychiatrist. And I’m
dialog: very committed to putting light into dark
dialog: corners, so to speak, and I’m very good
dialog: at finding my way into the places people
dialog: hide their secrets. I do it primarily
dialog: because I think it helps them but also
dialog: frankly because I’m interested in what
dialog: people have to hide. Betty has a very
dialog: dark corner that I have never found my
dialog: way into, despite considerable, careful
dialog: effort. And the only thing I know about
dialog: her dark place is that you are in it.
dialog: And I’m wondering if you’1ll be honest
dialog: enough to tell me: why are you something
dialog: that she won’t talk about?
dialog: This is said simply, directly...without threat or malice.
speaker_heading: BANNER
dialog: There are...aspects of my personality

speaker_heading: BANNER
dialog: It’s a little more complicated than that.
dialog: Samson, I’ve been alone for a long time
dialog: now. I have to be. The toughest part of
dialog: it is that I worry about what I’ve done
dialog: to Betty. If she’s happy and you’re a
dialog: part of that, then that makes me very
dialog: happy. Honestly. The last thing I want
dialog: to do is cause any trouble for her...or
