dialog: Moments later...
text: She approaches the shoreline and scans the dark horizon. In

text: One attraction faces her on the beach level underneath the
text: boardwalk. It’s called “SHAMAN’S VISION QUEST”, a Native
text: American mystical themed funhouse with an entrance that faces
text: the water. The facade is painted to resemble a forest with

scene_heading: INT. VISION QUEST. HALL OF MIRRORS. NIGHT
text: Adelaide enters a room that’s still forest themed but also
text: covered in mirrors. She walks past several distorted
text: reflections. A short one, a weird one, and a weirder one.
text: With a RUMBLE OF LIGHTNING the lights go out, and the FOREST
text: NOISE STOPS. What was kinda eerie when lit becomes downright
dialog: terrifying when dark.
text: The only light comes from the glowing red exit sign. She
text: walks towards it but hits a mirror. She looks up. The “EXIT”
text: sign appears forwards and backwards, over and over again in
text: infinite reflections. Adelaide reaches her hands out and
text: tries to make her way down the mirrored wall.
text: She begins whistling “ITSY BITSY SPIDER” again to make her
text: feel at ease, but she stops in near panic when a WHISTLE from
text: the halls overtakes hers. Somebody, somewhere in the mirrored
text: labyrinth is whistling in an attempt to emulate her tune.
text: Something her size SCURRIES QUICKLY across the hallway.
text: Adelaide backs up almost against a mirror. She slowly begins

dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: You can’t help him?
text: Zora is laying on the bed with headphones on. She turns as
text: her mom passes by.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: What happened?
scene_heading: INT. WILSON’S BAYSIDE HOUSE. HALLWAY. DAY
text: Adelaide opens the closet door. Jason sits there.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Oh baby. That’s why you can’t play
dialog: in there.
text: Jason’s tears turn to rage.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: Didn't this happen last year?
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Zora, please...
text: The moment is broken by a DISTANT BUZZ that starts small but
text: gets closer.
speaker_heading: GABE (0.S.)
dialog: Hey!
text: The three of them look at each other..
scene_heading: EXT. BAYSIDE. DAY
text: Adelaide, Zora and Jason stand on the dock by their house.
text: Gabe, a pillar of pride, stands triumphantly at the steering
text: wheel of a small motor boat that buzzes around in circles. He
text: beams while Adelaide, Zora and Jason remain thoroughly
text: unimpressed.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Well... What’dya think?! “Craw-
dialog: Daddy”!
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: (unimpressed)
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: It’s got a cassette player and
dialog: everything... All it needs is a new
dialog: coat of paint!
text: They just watch him. He holds up a life preserver.
speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, “J”, look!. It even came with
dialog: one of these!
text: The boat engine SPUTTERS TO A HALT. Smoke bellows from it.
dialog: Gabe goes
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: (to Adelaide)
dialog: He’s kidding right?
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: He’s not kidding.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Hold up. He told me how to fix
dialog: this.
text: to the back of the boat and pounds it with his fist
dialog: a couple times.
speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t worry. I got it real cheap!
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: I would hope so.
speaker_heading: GABE
text: She veers a little to the left, so
dialog: you have to stay on it, but other
dialog: than that it’s perfect!
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Also, Josh got a boat, so we can do
dialog: a dual-family voyage.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Ah. I see.
speaker_heading: JASON
text: Josh's boat is probably way better.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: He said Josh’s boat is probably
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: It’s not a contest. It’s something
dialog: I thought would be nice for the
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: But will we all fit tho?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Okay, you know what? Y’all are
dialog: spoiled.
text: The engine starts up again. Gabe almost falls. Adelaide and
text: Zora are amused.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON’S CAR. DAY
text: Gabe pouts as he drives through a road lined with redwood
text: trees. The rest of the family chills in their seats. Jason
text: snaps in the back. Zora reads. Adelaide checks in on Gabe’s
dialog: mood.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: Did you know this country produces,
dialog: like twice as much waste per capita
dialog: as any other country in the
dialog: developed world?
text: No one responds. Jason looks at her dryly.
speaker_heading: ZORA (CONT'D)
dialog: I forgot. No one cares about the
dialog: environment.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Since when did you become such a
dialog: tree hugger?
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: I’m not a tree hugger.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: I like it. I’m just saying.
text: Zora watches Jason continue to snap.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: ..-Maybe you could just tell us
dialog: what’s supposed to happen and we
dialog: can picture it.
text: He keeps snapping.
speaker_heading: ZORA (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, at a certain point--
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: --Kiss my anus, Zora.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: What?!?
text: Zora is shocked, and Adelaide tries to hide her smile.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Why are we even talkin’ bout
dialog: “anuses?”
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: “Anus” isn’t a curse word.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: That doesn’t matter.
speaker_heading: ZORA
text: Disgusting.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: See I would’ve preferred a curse
dialog: word in this case.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: (To Adelaide)
dialog: I can see you laughing in the
dialog: mirror.
text: Gabe leans on the horn.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: OK, you know what? We don’t always
dialog: need to be talking. There are
dialog: families that enjoy silence.
text: The rest of them look around “yeesh”. Adelaide knows her
text: family. She turns on the radio. “I Got Five On It” by Luniz
text: is on. Gabe’s mood immediately lifts.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: “I got Five on it...”
text: He grooves in his seat. Zora and Jason share a look.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: What does “I got five on it” mean?
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: It’s about drugs.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: It’s a dope song; don’t do drugs.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Jason. Get it in rhythm.
text: She starts snapping to the rhythm. Jason follows along.
text: Gabe loosens up and sit dances singing along.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: “I got five on it...”
text: Zora and Adelaide share a look through the rearview mirror.
text: Adelaide shrugs. Zora rolls her eyes in pleasant conceit.
scene_heading: EXT. REDWOOD ROAD. DAY
text: The car drives past more redwood trees.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON’S CAR. TRANSITIONAL ROAD. DAY
text: They emerge from the wood-lined road and overlook downtown
text: Santa Cruz’s amusement park, boardwalk and beach. The
text: rollercoaster looms menacingly in the distance.
text: Adelaide hides her apprehension as they head towards the
text: scene of her past horror.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. CROSSWALK. DAY
text: The car arrives at a crosswalk. A CROSSING GUARD steps out in
text: front of the car and stops them. They wait while a line of on-
text: leave sailors crosses the street in front of the Wilson’s
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: Why can’t I drive in the parking
dialog: lot?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: You’re not old enough.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: I’m not talking to you.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Hmm, let me think about that for a
dialog: second... no.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Because I cherish my life.
text: As the sailors pass, Adelaide watches the town go by and
text: remains preoccupied with thought.
text: FLASHBACK...
scene_heading: INT. RAYNE’S CAR. NIGHT
text: Rayne drives away from the rainy beach. We can’t quite hear
text: words but can tell that Russell is drunk. He and Rayne argue.
text: Young Adelaide sits in the backseat in total shock.
scene_heading: PRESENT DAY...
scene_heading: INT. WILSON’S CAR. ROAD TO AMUSEMENT PARK. DAY
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Ahhh. Damn it.
text: Adelaide snaps out of her daydream. They’ve just turned a
text: corner and ended up stuck behind an ambulance and cop car
dialog: that block the street.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: Oh my God.
text: A couple of COPS are taking statements from locals on the
text: sidewalk who witnessed the incident at hand. Two EMTs load an
text: unconscious bleeding homeless man into the ambulance.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Don’t look. Don’t look.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: You gotta be kidding me.
text: A cop waves the car past. Jason watches the man.
dialog: 25.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. BY THE BOARDWALK. DAY
text: The Wilsons, having parked, step onto the sand carrying
text: folding chairs and other beach gear. As they walk, Adelaide
text: fights the urge to look behind her. Eventually she steals a
text: nonchalant glance back in the direction of where the ‘Vision
text: Quest’ was when she was a child. The attraction is still
text: there, but it’s name has been changed to ‘Merlin’s Forest.’
text: It still has the same “FIND YOURSELF” sign, but the Shaman
text: has been replaced with an old white wizard who still points
text: his finger outwards like a bizarro Uncle Sam.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Was that guy dead?
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: The guy in the ambulance?
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Ambulance means he’s alive, right?
text: Jason, unsure, nods and starts snapping again.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. PICNIC. DAY
text: They arrive at the Tyler family’s beach set-up: umbrella,
text: chairs, and a stocked cooler already set up in tidy order.
scene_heading: JOSH TYLER (Caucasian 40) KITTY TYLER (Caucasian 40) sit.
text: Josh and Kitty are both a couple drinks in.

speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Ay!
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Yay!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You said 2:30! Where’s your
dialog: efficiency, man? Efficiency!
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: We got held up.
speaker_heading: JOSH KITTY
dialog: I'm kidding, don’t worry Hey girl.
dialog: about it.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: We made it.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Oh my God. Zora, you’ve gotten so
dialog: big! You look so pretty?
speaker_heading: ZORA JOSH
dialog: (Hates the compliment) Hey, Jason. You want a beer?
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Um...
speaker_heading: KITTY ADELAIDE
dialog: (To Zora) (To Jason)
dialog: Lindsey and Becca will be No. The answer is “no.”
dialog: happy to see you. (To Josh)
dialog: Please give me a couple more
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: KITTY JOSH
dialog: (to Becca and Lindsey) (To Jason)
dialog: Guys, look who’s here! I kid. Here’s a soda.
text: Becca flies a kite, Lindsey does cartwheels. They wave. Zora

text: over to them.
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Hi, Jason!
text: Jason waves shyly as he walks off.
text: LATER...
text: The two families chill on the beach. Zora sits near the twins
text: who practice gymnastics. Jason plays nearby in the sand.
text: Gabe and Josh pal around, pouring beers into plastic cups and
text: cracking each other up.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Have you taken her on her maiden
dialog: voyage yet?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Just rode her home. But we’re gonna
dialog: do the family thing soon.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Cool. We could do a double
dialog: excursion.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Yeah, I mean, it’s small, but it’s
text: a real classic design.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Hey, it’s not about the size of the
dialog: boat...
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: ..-The fuck outta here.
text: Josh laughs.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Kitty!
text: Kitty who is talking to Adelaide looks over.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear Gabe got a boat?
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Oh? Cool.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He says “it’s small.” I said, “It’s
dialog: not the size of the boat...”
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: (to Josh)
dialog: Wow. You thought that bared
dialog: repeating. .?
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: He did though. He really did.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Screw all of you.
text: Adelaide glances back again still distracted by the ‘Merlin’s
text: Forest’. Kitty clocks it.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: ‘Merlin’s Forest’...?
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: I think that changed. It used to be
dialog: called ‘Vision Quest.’
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Oh, how culturally insensitive of
dialog: them...
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Yeah. Totally.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Addy, beer, wine, vodka cran?
dialog: Mimosa? I got everything.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Do you have water?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Um... I’ve got ice.
dialog: 28.
text: He hands her a cup of ice. Then passes kitty a drink. He
text: pulls her drink away before giving it to her.
dialog: practical joke.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: I hate you.
dialog: (to Adelaide)
dialog: It never stops. I honestly think
dialog: about murdering him sometimes.
text: Adelaide laughs.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: So nothing’s new.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Actually. Since you asked...
dialog: The old lame
text: Kitty smiles. She turns her head showcasing her face from
dialog: different angles.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: What..? What...? Oh my God. Did you
dialog: have something “done?";
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Just an itsy-bitsy thing..
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Fuck off. You look exactly the same
dialog: as you did last year.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: That’s the idea. A little bit goes
dialog: a long way. Not that you need it
dialog: you beautiful motherfucker.
text: Adelaide quietly doesn’t accept the compliment. She looks
text: around the beach.
speaker_heading: KITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop. I can already tell the things
dialog: you think are flaws are so
dialog: annoying.
text: Adelaide almost says something, but doesn’t.
speaker_heading: KITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: I'm kidding. Tell me...
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Sometimes I have a hard time...
dialog: talking.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: You ever wonder “what if... What if
dialog: things had happened differently?”
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: I don’t know what you mean?
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: You mean the What-if-I-never-got-
dialog: married-and-had-kids question? Um,
dialog: yeah. I’m having it literally right
dialog: now. Trust me. The girls have just
dialog: gotten to the age where I feel like
dialog: I can finally go to the spa once a
dialog: week for ‘me time.’
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: “Me time?” What’s that?
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: It’s mandatory.
dialog: 30.
text: DOWN BY THE WATER...
text: Becca approaches Jason. Lindsey does cartwheels. She lands on
text: the sand structure he’s making.
speaker_heading: LINDSEY
dialog: (to Jason)
dialog: Oops. Oh shit! My bad.
text: Lindsey continues cartwheeling back and forth.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: It doesn’t matter.
text: Becca offers Jason the kite reel.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Wanna try? It’s pretty dumb, but
dialog: you might like it.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Um. Okay.
speaker_heading: LINDSEY
dialog: The wind’s good.
text: Jason tries to fly the kite. Lyndsey cartwheels over to Zora
text: who reads on the beach.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Your brother's so weird.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: He just has a problem focusing.
text: They look over at Jason who tries to fly the kite while
text: watching his own hand snap.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Are you going in the water..?
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: I’m good.
speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Why not?

speaker_heading: ZORA

speaker_heading: JASON

dialog: right?
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE

speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Didn’t we all?

scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. PORT-O-POTTY - DAY
text: Jason takes a long walk past sunbathers and other people to
text: the port-o-potty near the boardwalk, becoming increasingly
text: remote from the group. When he arrives at the port-o-potty a
text: sour older lady emerges. He lets her pass and then goes
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. PICNIC - DAY
text: Adelaide continues with Kitty.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE

speaker_heading: ADELAIDE

speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Okay, can I tell you? I cry at that
dialog: part every time.
text: Josh interrupts from afar.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You cry? Really?
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: (To Josh)
dialog: No one’s talking to you.
dialog: (To Adelaide)
dialog: You were saying...
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: The ‘Grand Pas’ is supposed to be a
dialog: dance for two, but I turned it into
text: a solo.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Um... that’s badass.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Nerve-racking. I thought I’d get
dialog: disqualified, but when I finished
dialog: the audience went crazy. I won
dialog: first prize. It was the best moment
dialog: of my life...besides Zora and
dialog: Jason's birth.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: The girls don’t make my top ten, by
dialog: the way. I’m convinced I would be a
dialog: movie star if I didn’t have them at
dialog: exactly the wrong time...
text: Adelaide starts watching people on the beach around them as
text: Kitty drones on. A guy chases his girlfriend who screams. A
text: small group of people laugh hard. A teen play fights with his
text: brother. Each vignette seems to make Adelaide increasingly
text: nervous but she hides it well.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I trained at Stella Adler and
dialog: booked two commercials before I met
dialog: Josh, and totally stopped
dialog: auditioning when I got preggers.
dialog: Then the move to San Fransisco was
dialog: like a fucking career killer. The
dialog: whole thing was supposed to be I
dialog: would fly out for auditions but
dialog: that never happened. I put myself
dialog: on tape for like half a year, but
dialog: it’s really not the same. You have
dialog: to be in the room for things to
text: fall into place.
text: A red frisbee falls onto the towel they’re sitting on.
text: Adelaide is startled.
speaker_heading: KITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus!
dialog: (To Adelaide)
dialog: Oh, look.
text: Adelaide looks down. The frisbee has landed perfectly on one
text: of the towel’s large, printed polka dots. Adelaide picks it
text: up, revealing the same colored dot underneath. It really is
text: eerily perfect. Adelaide is quietly concerned.
speaker_heading: KITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa. That’s crazy. We’ve been
dialog: having so many weird coincidences
dialog: happening lately.
text: A guy runs over to claim the frisbee. Adelaide gives it to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Thanks.
text: He leaves. Adelaide looks over and sees the twins playing
dialog: near Zora. No Jason.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: No “I'm sorry”? Dick. Anyway, we
dialog: should go back to our place. I
dialog: think it’s ‘vodka ‘o clock.’

dialog: 34.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH PORT-O-POTTY. DAY
text: Jason comes out of the port-o-potty and starts walking back
text: to the beach but stops when he notices something strange. A
text: man stands facing away from him on the beach about twenty
text: yards away. The man has his arms stretched out at his sides
text: in a relaxed manner, like a yoga pose. Other people walk
text: around him, only occasionally noticing him. Jason is
text: transfixed. He walks slowly and wide around the man trying to

dialog: You know, I was thinking about

text: He notices Adelaide’s stillness.
speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey...

speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: I want to go.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Go? Where?
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Home. I can’t be here. It’s too

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: You serious?
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Being here, it’s like there’s this

speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Well I think you’re you.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Gabe, I need to tell you something

speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: When I was a kid I went to that

speaker_heading: RAGE.

text: Adelaide confides in Gabe.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE

speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know I’m here, right? I mean,

speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah, shit.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: GABE

scene_heading: INT. WILSON BAYSIDE HOUSE. FOYER. NIGHT
text: Adelaide, Gabe and Jason stand out the front door window.
text: Four people stand near the edge of the property silhouetted
text: by the moonlight. Their contour seem to fit the same familial
text: archetypes as the Wilsons themselves. On the left, a boy:
text: hunched and wavering; Next to him, a father: hulking with
text: head tilted oddly; Next, a mother: still and poised. On the
text: right, a daughter: thin and sleek.
text: Adelaide watches in horror.

speaker_heading: ADELAIDE

dialog: Okay, I asked you nice. Now I’m

text: All of a sudden, with a quick and coordinated dart, the “BAD

text: comes directly towards him.
speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, hey, hey...
scene_heading: INT. WILSON’S BAYSIDE HOUSE. FOYER/LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

text: Suddenly the “Bad Son’s” head pops up close. He wears a
dialog: rubber burn mask.
text: Adelaide rushes in with Zora and pulls Jason close.
text: A SHARP WHISTLE cuts through the silence. That familiar tune,
text: “Itsy Bitsy Spider,” terrorizes Adelaide.
text: It’s her. The “BAD MOTHER” walks slowly past the windows
text: towards the front door.
text: A few FOOTSTEPS THUMP on the roof.
scene_heading: EXT. WILSON'S BAYSIDE HOUSE. FRONT LAWN. NIGHT
text: We still can’t see their faces, but the “Bad Mother” arrives
text: at the front door. The “Bad Father” stops BANGING THE DOOR
text: She lifts a rock near the front steps.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S BAYSIDE HOUSE. FOYER/LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: The damn “Hide-a-key!”
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Hide-a-key”? What kind of white-
dialog: shit...?!?
dialog: 
text: The door opens with force. Gabe tries to hold it shut, but
text: the Bad Father opens it anyway. He swings at the “Bad Father”
text: who catches the bat and takes it away, as if Gabe were a
text: child. He brings the bat down on Gabe’s knee with a CRACK.
text: Gabe goes down.
speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: Aaaaahhhhhggg!!!!
text: Adelaide, Zora and Jason back up into the living room. To

dialog: the window.
text: To their right, a Sky light crashes. The “Bad Daughter,”
text: falls into the kitchen.
text: The “Bad Father” and “Bad Daughter” back the Wilsons into the
text: Living room as the “Bad Son” scurries past the windows.
text: Adelaide holds her children close as Gabe tries to get up.
text: Wincing, he stumbles back into the living room in agony. The
text: “Bad Father” follows him in to the room slowly, bat in hand.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It’s okay. Just stay close.
text: The “Bad Daughter” turns into the living room.
text: The “Bad Mother” enters. She is RED, Adelaide’s doppleganger.
text: She walks in a calm erudite manner; the clear head of her
dialog: family.
text: It’s dark. Red arrives at the chair in front of them and
text: sits. She motions for them to sit.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The “Bad Son”, smashes a hole in the back porch door window
text: and enters.
text: The Wilson's sit on the couch. Except for Gabe who tries to
text: stand aided by the arm of the couch.
text: The “Bad Son” lights a match in his hand with a SNAP. The
text: fireplace erupts in flames.
text: The fire backlights the “Bad Family.” The “Bad Son” shuffles
text: to Red's side and sits like a dog. She strokes his masked
dialog: head.
dialog: We still can’t really see their features in full, but at this
text: point it’s clear that these home invaders are DOPPLEGANGERS
dialog: of the Wilsons.
text: ABRAHAM, Gabe’'s doppleganger, seems a little out of it. His
text: attention wanders like a rampage killer lost in some kind of
text: psychotic break.
text: UMBRAE, Zora’s doppleganger, stands with perfect posture,
text: sleeked back hair, and an evil little smirk.
text: PLUTO, Jason’s doppleganger, breathes thick under his mask.
text: He carries himself like an animal.
text: The entire “Bad Family” wear red jumpsuits with and sandals
dialog: and one glove.

speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: What..? What..?
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: It’s us.

speaker_heading: GABE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Once upon a time, there was a girl,
text: and the girl had a shadow.
dialog: The two were connected; tethered
dialog: together. So whatever happened to
dialog: the girl happened to the shadow...
dialog: When the girl ate, her food was
text: given to her, warm and tasty, but
dialog: when the shadow was hungry, she had
text: to eat rabbits, raw and bloody. On
dialog: Christmas the girl received
text: wonderful toys, soft and cushy, but
text: the shadow’s toys were so sharp and
text: cold they’d slice through her
dialog: fingers when she played with them.
dialog: Time passed. They both got older,
dialog: and one day the girl met a handsome
dialog: prince and fell in love. At that
dialog: same time, the shadow met Abraham.
dialog: It didn’t matter if she loved him
dialog: or not, he was tethered to the
dialog: girl's prince after all. Then the
dialog: girl had her first child; a
dialog: beautiful baby girl... but the
dialog: shadow... she gave birth to a
dialog: little monster. Umbrae was born
text: laughing. The girl had a second
dialog: child, a boy this time. They had to
dialog: cut her open and take him from her
dialog: belly. The shadow had to do it all
dialog: herself. She named him Pluto. He
dialog: was born to love fire.
text: Pluto growls at Gabe.
speaker_heading: RED (CONT’D)
dialog: So you see, the Shadow hated the
dialog: girl so much for so long, until one
dialog: day she realized that she wasn’t
text: being punished by the girl at all.
dialog: She was being tested by God.

dialog: How about this. Take me to the ATM.
dialog: I’ll get all the cash I can take

text: Gabe, who has been in denial of the supernatural element at
text: play, loses steam.
speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you people?

text: disappointed with the question.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: What are we...?
text: Red leans in.
speaker_heading: RED (CONT’D)
dialog: ...We’re Americans.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GABE

speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. Don’t touch me. Get off!
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: No!

speaker_heading: RED

speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: (To Red)
dialog: You want me right?
scene_heading: EXT. WILSON’S BAYSIDE HOUSE. FRONT LAWN. NIGHT

speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Okay. Okay. It’s okay. Look at me.
dialog: You're going to be okay. Show him

speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Years ago I had a vision. In this
dialog: vision I saw a line of blood on the

text: Red stands. She slowly walks to Adelaide’s side.
speaker_heading: RED (CONT'D)
dialog: During this vision God spoke to me.

dialog: And his voice... It was the most

scene_heading: EXT. DOWN THE STREET. NIGHT

text: After a few paces, she turns around just as the figure runs

scene_heading: EXT. OPEN WATER. NIGHT
text: The MOTORBOAT BUZZES. Gabe comes to in pitch black. He pokes
text: a hole. He’s in a garbage bag, lying in the back of his own
text: boat. He looks through the torn hole at Abraham who stands at
text: the steering wheel with his back to Gabe. Gabe looks around.
text: The bat is propped up by Abraham who also has his scissors in
text: his hand. There’s a life preserver floatation device attached
text: to a coiled rope and tethered to the boat.
text: Gabe starts slowly and quietly to pull himself out of the
text: bag. He peers behind them. The lights of the shore are far
text: and getting further away.
text: He reaches for the floatation device and slowly pulls it
text: towards him. Suddenly the boat’s motor coughs. It’s failing.
text: Abraham turns as Gabe shrinks back into the garbage bag.
text: Abraham walks over. He doesn’t notice the coil of unwound
text: rope he’s standing inside of.
text: Abraham begins BANGING the motor exactly the way Gabe did
dialog: earlier. It’s being stubborn.
text: Gabe slowly crawls forward and gets the bat. He sneaks up
text: behind Abraham and swings just as Abraham turns around,
text: knocking him off the boat. As he falls, the rope tangles
text: around Abraham’s foot, cinching into a knot. The floatation
text: device and rope goes overboard with him.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Ha, ha..! Fuck you!
text: Gabe hits the motor with the bat in triumph; the motor revs
text: into action. The boat takes off, sending Gabe off the back
text: and into the water. The boat drives away. Gabe wades
text: frantically. He looks around, but doesn’t see Abraham.
text: Then... Suddenly, Abraham surfaces and swings his scissors at
text: Gabe but the boat is now far enough away that the rope around
text: Abraham’s ankle goes taught and he is pulled away.
text: Gabe is left there, bobbing in the water, as the boat pulls
text: Abraham away on his belly, like an unwilling waterskier.
text: Gabe watches, as the boat WHIRS away into the dark, night
dialog: water.

text: Pluto continues to mirror Jason’s wrist. Jason starts his
text: snapping. Pluto snaps, lighting a match. Pluto is intrigued.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The snapping continues, but nothing happens. Pluto’s GUTTURAL

scene_heading: EXT. DOWN THE STREET. NIGHT
text: Umbrae gets closer and closer to Zora.
text: Just then DON, a large old man, comes out of the nearby
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: The Fuck?! Get off my car!
text: Umbrae turns. Zora takes the moment to flee back towards the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: DON (CONT’D)
dialog: Come here. Come here...
text: Umbrae gets off the car ready to pursue Zora. Don walks
text: towards Umbrae.
speaker_heading: DON (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey, kid! I’m talking to you.
text: Umbrae stops at “kid”. Now she’s angry.
text: As Zora runs, huffing and puffing, Umbrae goes down and
text: severs his Achilles tendon with her scissors. He screams and
text: falls to the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN WATER. NIGHT
text: Moments later, Gabe hears the boat’s motor getting louder
text: again. He prepares himself and faces the boat, but when its
text: about 25 yards from him the MOTOR SPUTTERS out again. The
text: boat slows to a glide and stops near him. Gabe looks for
text: Abraham, but doesn’t see him. The life preserver floats by
text: him. No Abraham. Gabe grabs the rope and pulls himself
text: towards the boat.
text: He climbs up the back of the boat just as Abraham attacks him
text: from behind. Gabe hangs on the back of the boat with Abraham
text: hanging onto him. Gabe hits the motor twice and it turns on.
text: Abraham, who's torso is pressed against the propeller gets
text: SLASHED across his chest and face as he falls back into the
text: water. Gabe, exhausted, falls into the boat as it drives
dialog: away.
dialog: 57.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON’S BAYSIDE HOUSE. UPSTAIRS CLOSET. NIGHT
text: As Pluto grunts, Jason begins snapping.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Wait. Wait. Look.
text: Pluto becomes curious and watches Jason’s hand. Jason snaps
text: faster and faster when, suddenly, the trick works! A few
text: sparks fly from Jason’s fingers catching Pluto entirely off
text: guard. He’s startled. Jason uses the moment to knock him over
text: and run out of the closet.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON’S HOUSE. FOYER/LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Red holds Adelaide down. The coffee table cracks even more.
text: Blood starts to pool on the side of Adelaide's face.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON’S BEACH HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: Jason trips and falls into the hallway. Pluto, confused, gets
text: up and lunges towards Jason, but Jason pulls the sock out
text: with his toes and SLAMS the door, just in time, with his
dialog: other foot.
text: Pluto SCREAMS.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S BAYSIDE HOUSE. FOYER/LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Adelaide and Red hear the SCREAM. They watch each other for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: That’s yours.
text: Red's still for a moment. Then, suddenly, she stands and
text: leaves the room headed towards Pluto.
text: Now alone, Adelaide leaps into action. First, she tries to
text: get out of the cuffs, but can’t. She tries to break the table
text: with her foot. She sees the fire poker across the room and
text: goes towards it, but is stopped again by the heavy table.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON’S BAYSIDE HOUSE. HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: Red opens the closet. Pluto’s inside. He stops yelling. He
text: exits and looks around sniffing the air. Jason is nowhere to
text: be seen. Pluto skitters into Jason’s room. Red starts walking
text: down the hallway in search of Jason.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She takes a step into Zora’s room. Red comes out. She sees
text: the basement door is open and goes inside.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S BAYSIDE HOUSE. FOYER/LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Adelaide sees the phone. She grabs it, dials ‘911’ again and
text: drags the coffee table a little.
text: As the phone rings, she slowly pulls the coffee table towards
text: the fire poker.
speaker_heading: RECORDED VOICE
dialog: All of our operators are currently
dialog: busy. Please hang on the line...
text: Adelaide is close enough to almost reach.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Come on...
text: She grabs the fire poker, barely. She darts over to the
text: coffee table and uses the poker and all of her strength to
text: quietly pry the wooden leg off the table.
text: Adelaide does enough damage to the coffee table to free
dialog: herself!
scene_heading: INT. WILSON’S BAYSIDE HOUSE. BASEMENT. NIGHT
text: Red walks through the basement looking for Jason. She finds
text: the box of keepsakes, picks up the stuffed bunny and looks at
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON’S BAYSIDE HOUSE. HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: Adelaide looks down the hallway. She sees no one. She
dialog: whispers.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Jason.... Jason...
text: She sees Jason’s silhouette emerge from the cabinet in the
text: bathroom. Relief but as he comes closer she begins to realize
text: it might not be him. She clutches her fire poker ready to
text: strike, but as he steps through the moonlight. It is JASON.
text: Just then Pluto scrambles out of his room and towards them
text: like a feral raccoon. Adelaide pulls down the bookshelf in
text: the hallway blocking Pluto who tries to scurry around it.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Adelaide grabs Jason and runs to the front door. As Red
text: emerges from the basement.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT LAWN. NIGHT

speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Where’s Zora? Zora...!
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: She ran.

dialog: the keys.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: Mom!!
scene_heading: EXT. WILSON’S FRONT LAWN. NIGHT
text: Zora runs back, out of breath.
speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: She’s crazy... she’s crazy.
text: Suddenly, they hear the familiar BUZZ of the boat.
text: The Wilson's race towards the dock. Pluto takes off after
text: them, on all fours.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK. NIGHT
text: They get to the boat just in the knick of time. Pluto lunges
text: at them, but misses. As the boat pulls away, Pluto stops at
text: the edge of the dock. He MOANS a menacing angry MOAN at them.
text: Red walks calmly down the length of the dock.
text: As the Wilson’s huddle in their boat, Umbrae arrives too;
text: back from her run. Zora SCREAMS. Umbrae paces impatiently.
text: She laughs at Zora. The Wilsons are silent with shock, except
dialog: for Gabe.
speaker_heading: GABE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The boat drives away. Red, Umbrae, and Pluto watch.
text: Abraham washes up on the shore. Blood pours from the gashes
text: on his chest and face. The “Bad Family” watch his body
text: emotionlessly.
text: Umbrae begins to run in pursuit; she disappears into the
text: woods. Pluto stares at his father.
scene_heading: INT. TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: The house has a modern, clean interior and the lights are all
text: on. There are museum-scale, elegant, abstract paintings
text: hanging everywhere. A second level overlooks the large main
text: room below and turns into a hallway leading to the bedrooms.
text: Josh sleeps in a reclining chair holding a glass of whisky.
text: The power dims and then comes right back on. The backup

dialog: drinking.
text: Kitty enters from upstairs.
speaker_heading: KITTY

text: Josh looks up to Kitty on the upper level.
speaker_heading: KITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: I thought I heard something
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Okay... something....
speaker_heading: KITTY
text: A rustling... walking... Like a

speaker_heading: OPHELIA

speaker_heading: KITTY

text: Josh and Kitty both look.

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: LINDSEY
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Jesus. The back up generator went

speaker_heading: BECCA
dialog: Just because we're in our rooms it

speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: --Fine! I don’t care. Go back to

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I just wanna remind everyone that

scene_heading: INT. TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Josh turns to look up at his daughters on the mezzanine
text: level. A THIRD TWIN lurks right behind Becca.
text: There’s a moment of confusion.
scene_heading: EXT. TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: From outside looking in, what commences next can only be
text: described as a seven second massacre.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Three more figures enter from strategic positions. They,
text: along with the “third twin”, are the “Bad” versions of the
text: Tylers. They quickly and efficiently subdue and stab their
text: counterparts in the necks with brass scissors. Blood
text: splatters and sprays against the white walls.
text: The “Bad Tylers” stand looking at each other for a moment.
text: Good Vibrations continues playing.
scene_heading: INT. TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: Kitty Tyler is the still alive. She chokes on blood as she
text: crawls towards her husband's body. TEX, Josh’s doppleganger,
text: moves in front of her and holds out his hand. She reaches for
text: it, but he pulls it away sadistically, pushing it through his
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: (gargled)
dialog: Please, stop.
speaker_heading: OPHELIA
dialog: Stopping “Good Vibrations,” by The
dialog: Beach Boys.
text: The music stops. DAHLIA, Kitty's doppleganger, walks over to
text: her. She has stitches running down both sides of her face and
text: suppresses a laugh with wild-eyed intensity. Kitty is
text: getting weaker. The inevitability is sinking in.
speaker_heading: KITTY
dialog: Ophelia, call the police...
text: Dahlia leans over and finishes the murder.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TYLER’S BAYSIDE HOUSE. NIGHT
text: Adelaide knocks on the front door frantically. “Fuck the
text: Police” by N.W.A. plays inside. Jason and Zora help a limping
text: Gabe up the bayside lawn towards Adelaide and the house. Tex
text: opens the door in Josh's robe.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: Josh, we need help. We were
dialog: attacked in our home...
text: Tex’s jaw drops into a shocked expression; like he can’t even
text: process. As he opens the door, Adelaide sees some blood on
text: his fingers.
text: Adelaide steps back from Tex who projects an overtly
text: sympathetic face and grabs her wrist.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Adelaide swings her fire poker at Tex. It strikes him in the
text: head hard. A trickle of blood rolls down his face, but he’s
text: still conscious.
text: Tex grabs the fire poker and her wrist. He tosses Adelaide
text: over the threshold and onto the floor inside the house.
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Hey!!!!
text: Dahlia and the “Bad Twins,” NIX and IO, pounce on Adelaide
text: and pull her deeper inside, towards the staircase. Josh slams
text: the door behind him, staying outside. He takes out his
text: scissors and drops the fire poker.
text: Zora SCREAMS. Tex looks at her with sadistic glee.
text: Tex starts making his way towards Gabe and the kids. With
text: each step he takes, he makes a different, taunting,
text: exaggerated expression like some kind of evil mime.
speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Zora and Jason)
dialog: Run.
text: Zora and Jason, stunned, begin to run towards the driveway.

speaker_heading: GABE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! What are you doing?! Huh? You
dialog: think you a man?!? Come get some
dialog: then. Come try, Bitch!
text: Tex can’t help himself. He turns away from the kids and
text: obliges Gabe who backs up towards the dock.
text: Tex delighted with the taunt, taunts back. He BELLOWS A WEIRD
text: clicking NOISE at Gabe. Crazy
speaker_heading: TEX
text: Click. Click. Click. !!!!!!!
text: He follows Gabe down the hill.
text: The kids look back at their father who is successfully
text: baiting Tex out towards the Tyler’s dock. They then look back
text: at each other. Jason is about to cry again, but Zora hits him
text: in the chest firmly, startling him out of it. An unspoken
text: agreement; they walk to the house. Zora picks up the fire
text: poker off the lawn.
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: INT. TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE. MASTER BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: Dahlia sits in front of her make up mirror. She’s lost, like
text: in a Marlyn Monroe haze. She applies make up to her crazy
text: face like she’s at the peak of glamorous career.
text: Adelaide sits on the floor, now with both wrists in the cuffs
text: and bound to the dresser. She looks around while Dahlia is
text: mesmerized by her Hollywood dream. Adelaide accidentally
text: makes a noise. Dahlia snaps out of her daydream and looks at
dialog: Adelaide with rediscovery.
text: She approaches Adelaide and puts her scissors up to her face.
text: She tries to decide where and how to cut Adelaide.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK. NIGHT
text: Gabe stumbles down the dock where his boat and Josh’s boat
text: are docked. Tex follows.
text: Gabe steps onto Josh’s boat.
scene_heading: INT. TYLER HOUSE. MASTER BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: Kitty wants to cut Adelaide so bad, but she stops herself.
text: Frustrated, she goes to the window. She’s waiting for someone
text: to arrive; not here yet. She’s getting impatient. Dahlia goes
text: to the dressing room mirror and puts the scissors up to her
text: face ready to cut INTO HER OWN CHEEK. Adelaide looks away.
scene_heading: INT. TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: Zora and Jason open the door. The room is a bloody mess. The
text: original Josh and Kitty Tyler’s bodies lay lifeless.
text: They quietly walk through the living room towards the stairs.
text: They hear a THUMP THUMP from upstairs that stops them dead in
text: their tracks. Jason picks up a heavy geode mounted on a metal
text: stand. He shrugs. They push forward up the stairs.
text: As they get to the top of the stairs they see a red
text: jumpsuited twin cartwheel across the doorway at the end of
dialog: the hall.
text: Zora and Jason hesitate before continuing down the hallway
text: past the dead original Tyler twins on the floor. As they
text: reach a corner A GALLOP QUICKLY APPROACHES. It’s Nix who
text: runs towards them at an alarming speed. She bares down on
text: Zora with her brass scissors, but Zora whacks her hand first
text: sending the scissors skidding across the floor.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Zora hits her again, sending her awkwardly careening over the
text: edge of the mezzanine and SMASHING through the coffee table
dialog: below.
text: They continue past an open closet when Io’s legs lower from a
text: handstand in the closet. She pops out lunging at them, but
text: Zora nails her on the head with the fire poker, knocking her
text: down. Zora winds up and finishes her with two more WHACKS.
text: Done. Their adrenaline spikes from the trauma, but they must
dialog: move on.
scene_heading: EXT. TYLER DOCK. JOSH'S BOAT. NIGHT
text: We see through Gabe’s eyes. Crouched in the small dark cabin.
text: The boat moves as Tex steps onto it. He leans over into the
dialog: boat.
text: Gabe face illuminated red as he shoots a flare gun at Tex.
text: The flare misses but hits the side of the boat and lands in
dialog: the boat.
text: The flare illuminates the entire area as Gabe gets the upper
text: hand and bashes Tex.
scene_heading: INT. TYLER BAYSIDE HOUSE. MASTER BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: The glow from the flare outside illuminates the entire
text: bedroom. Dahlia, rushes to the window with a freshly bloody
text: face. Her eyes widen with excitement and horror. A SILENT
text: SCREAM that loses itself in its own production and somehow
text: ends with a almost tickled glee.
text: The door behind Dahlia slowly opens. Zora takes a couple of
text: steps towards her and swings, but Dahlia sees her in the
text: reflection of the window and turns, catching the fire poker.
text: She overpowers Zora, who screams as Dahlia falls on top of
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ADELAIDE
dialog: No!
text: Adelaide lunges towards them but is stopped by the handcuffs.
text: Dahlia raises her scissors over her head, when all of a

dialog: he picked up.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER...
dialog: 67.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TYLER’S BAYSIDE HOUSE. NIGHT

dialog: of the most brutal and terrifying
text: wide-spread and coordinated attacks
dialog: this country has seen. There is
dialog: obviously a lot of misinformation
dialog: out there, so we’re being careful
dialog: what we report, but what is clear

speaker_heading: ZORA
dialog: Where is she? Did I get her.

speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Oh! She’s there! She’s there!

scene_heading: EXT. SANTA CRUZ STREET. DAY

dialog: dead.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. TYLER’S CAR. SANTA CRUZ STREET. DAY
text: Jason, in the backseat, tries his magic trick. He snaps and
text: eventually a big spark shoots from his fingers. Surprised he
text: did it, he looks around for someone else who saw it. Zora
text: gives him a bloody fist bump. Suddenly, Jason gets a weird
text: look on his face. He looks ahead.
text: The car turns a bend to find that the Wilson’s old car is in

speaker_heading: ADELAIDE

speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: Jason!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: Pluto pulls down his mask. He clenches his scissors.
text: Jason stops outside the car and Pluto matches his

text: takes a step backwards. Pluto follows suit. Jason starts
text: walking backwards; Pluto copies him walking into the fire.
text: Gabe crumples out of the car.
text: Adelaide almost instinctively lunges after him. Pluto goes up

text: She walks through the dark opening Young Red came from. She
text: finds a wall and pushes the surface and it opens a crack and
text: then the door swings open. A white rabbit hops out of the

scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM. DAY

scene_heading: INT. THE UNDERPASS. DAY
text: Adelaide walks down the hallway. She passes the first open

dialog: I believe they figured out how to

speaker_heading: RED (CONT'D)
dialog: But they failed, and they abandoned
