speaker_heading: WHIRLING.
text: SEVERAL NEWS VANS, POLICE CARS, AND AMBULANCES are parked

text: Behind the motel, a BACK-HOE tears into the ground. COPS
text: circle the back-hoe, digging with shovels.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER (V.0.)
text: This is a live shot of the Prairie
text: View Motel, in the eastern side of
dialog: McKinley County. We've been told
dialog: police have been working out here
dialog: for several hours, but the details
dialog: we're getting from them are sketchy
dialog: at best. What we do know is that
dialog: they've borrowed some equipment
dialog: from a local farmer, and started
text: digging in the rear of the
dialog: property. What they're looking for
dialog: though, we're not exactly sure.
text: The camera shot shakily zooms in on the back-hoe, as the

text: As the raccoon checks out the quality of the decaying rodent

scene_heading: INT. BMW - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think the engine made a noise.

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You were really dreaming over there
text: earlier. Mumbling and jerking
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I dreamt you were trying to kill
dialog: me. We were at my parent's
dialog: anniversary party, and my mother
dialog: wouldn't stop talking. You started
dialog: screaming you couldn't take it
dialog: anymore, and you tried to strangle
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'd never do that. Although the
dialog: thought of strangling your mother
dialog: did cross my mind.

dialog: Go on back to sleep. Maybe next

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's not anything.

speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She's lost. I know right where I

text: David squints toward the sound, but it's too dark and too

text: BUSHES RATTLE AGAIN... this time louder
text: David throws another nervous glance into the bushes... still
text: nothing. He leans closer...
text: ...just as a RACCOON darts out of the brush past him.
text: David leaps back, startled. He catches his breath as the

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddamn raccoons are killing me.
text: David turns... trots back toward the road after Amy.
text: In the distance behind David, a FIGURE rises from the bushes

text: make his way down the road with Amy.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE ROAD - LATER
text: David and Amy stand in the gravel parking lot, staring at a

text: L-shape. The Bates Motel... in need of a paint job.
text: A primer painted PICKUP TRUCK sits outside the office, under
text: a "$19.00 A NIGHT" sign that hangs over the office screen
text: door. Above that is a crooked "VACANCY" sign.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We could go back to the car. You

speaker_heading: DAVID

text: Around the room, a few stock scenery pictures hanging on the
text: wall and a STUFFED JACK-A-LOPE, a rabbit with glued-on
text: antlers, resting on the counter. At the rabbit's feet is a
text: DESK BELL, with a sign... "Ring Me".
text: There's some MUFFLED 0.S. SCREAMING from the back room behind
text: the counter.
text: David and Amy hear it... exchange a glance before David taps
text: the bell. There's some RUSTLING, then MASON, (40's), five-
text: foot nothing and hundred thirty pounds in his sweaty t-shirt
text: and jeans, appears from the back room.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Hey, folks. What can I do ya for?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (off the screams)
dialog: Everything okay back there?
text: Mason cocks his head, unsure. David motions to the back

text: button and the SCREAMS SILENCE.
speaker_heading: MASON
dialog: Sorry about that. Gets a little
dialog: boring around here late nights.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I bet so. Listen, our car broke

speaker_heading: MASON

scene_heading: ONSCREEN.

text: behind them. No one's there.
text: Suddenly, the power goes out again, sending the room back
text: into dark silence.
text: David grabs the cactus lamp off the table, ready to swing it.
text: They back against the wall... slide down to the floor
text: The THUMPING ON THE ADJOINING DOOR BEGINS AGAIN... the lights
text: go dark, then burst back on, then off again... repeating like
text: a strobe... flashes of screams erupt from the television
text: couple each time it restarts.
text: And then with each flash of light, a FIGURE BECOMES
text: VISIBLE... standing frozen just inside the bathroom doorway.
text: He doesn't move... just stands there, filling the doorway,
text: only a few feet away from David and Amy.
text: David and Amy don't see him... just stay huddled against the
dialog: wall.
text: The pounding grows louder... the shakes on the door handle
text: harder... the flashes of light over the figure come faster
text: Then suddenly everything falls still. The lights turn on,

speaker_heading: DAVID

scene_heading: INT. PRAIRIE VIEW MOTEL/BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: the sink. HER HALF-EATEN APPLE.
scene_heading: INT. PRAIRIE VIEW MOTEL/HONEYMOON SUITE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: GET AWAY FROM US!

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: COME ON!

text: The men move calmly after them... converging... following.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: They're coming!
text: As Amy runs, her CELL PHONE falls from her pocket and crashes

scene_heading: INT. PRAIRIE VIEW MOTEL/HONEYMOON SUITE - CONTINUOUS

text: David and Amy back away from the door, looking eerily similar
text: to the old couple they watched on the video.
text: 0.S. FOOTSTEPS... heavy feet on gravel... growing louder...
dialog: closer.
text: David and Amy stare at the door, waiting... dreading. Then a
text: SOFT CLICKING AT THE DOOR... like fingernails tapping at the
dialog: wood.
text: The CLICKING TURNS TO CLAWING... long, slow scratches down
text: the door. Then the door THUMPS, like someone has just
dialog: pressed their weight against it
text: David throws his body against the door, holding it secure.

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've got a gun! Get away or I

text: THE THUMPING AGAINST THE DOOR SUDDENLY STOPS. The world goes

dialog: glance... Did it work?
text: And then the room erupts with POUNDING... like clubs beating
text: against the door and windows.
text: Amy throws her hands over her ears... backs into the corner
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: LEAVE US ALONE!

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And there's nothing stopping them

text: Then David presses the button... the image starts playing...
text: ...V.0. BANGING ON THE DOOR. The couple jumps up, rushes to

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)

text: He flips on the light... his eyes scan over the room,
text: searching... until they settle on a MISSING TILE in the

text: David lifts the shower curtain back up, obstructing its view.

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DAVID

scene_heading: INT. CRAWLSPACE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We can't go in that, David. We

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Baby, we have to. Come on, I'll

scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Dark, dank and claustrophobic... hand-dug through the earth.
text: There’s just enough room for them to slide on their stomach.

dialog: This is what it feels like to be buried alive.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on, Amy. It's gonna be okay.

speaker_heading: DAVID (0.S.) (CONT'D)

scene_heading: VACANCY 3-23-06 61.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: DAVID

dialog: them.
text: The tunnel squeezes even tighter... the walls have partially

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: David, please. It’s going to fall.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
