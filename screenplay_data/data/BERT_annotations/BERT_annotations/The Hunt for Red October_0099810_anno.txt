speaker_heading: BEAUMONT
dialog: Tell me, Chief.
speaker_heading: COB
dialog: (taking his time)
dialog: Well, Jonesy here, he's a music freak,
dialog: right? And he figures this sonar system
dialog: is basically just a big old 300 million
dialog: ddllar stereo unit. So he gets this
dialog: piece of Pavarmt3i --
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: it was Paganini.
speaker_heading: COB
dialog: Whatever. It's this piece of music he
dialog: likes so much he wants to share it,
dialog: right? So he re-wires the computer and
dialog: figures how to put it in the water with
text: a gigawatt of juice behind it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Now, the Captain, he don't much care.
text: But about twenty-one boats out of San
text: Diego, including one way out at Pearl,

speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)

speaker_heading: PT TIN
dialog: It's my responsibility to oversee the

speaker_heading: RAMIUS
dialog: And you accomplish this by searching

speaker_heading: PUTIN
dialog: There is no such thing as privacy in

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Gentlemen, the last twenty four hours
dialog: have seen some extraordinary Soviet
dialog: naval activity. The first to sail was --
speaker_heading: (SLIDE)
dialog: this ship, the Red October. A variant
dialog: of the typhoon class, she's some six
dialog: hundred fifty feet long. Thirty-two
dialog: thousand tons submerged displacement,
text: roughly the size of a World War II
dialog: aircraft Carrier.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Unlike the standard typhoon, equipped
dialog: to fire long-range missiles from Russian
dialog: waters, Red October carries fifty-six
text: SS-311s, which is a short-range attack
text: mis it with eight independent warheads.
dialog: That's four hundred forty-eight warheads
text: all spedfically designed to fire close in.
speaker_heading: (ANOTHER SLIDE)
dialog: We believe these doors on the bow, and
text: here again on the stern, enclose a

speaker_heading: PELT
dialog: You would characterize this as a first

text: Ryan glances at Greer. Greer smi reassuringly.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: There's no doubt about that, sir. She
text: is designed to approach by stealth, and
text: fire on a target with little or no warning.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL
dialog: An offensive weapon. The kind you start
dialog: wars with.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Precisely, Admiral..
speaker_heading: (RE: MAP)
dialog: if I may continue. Shortly after the
dialog: Dallas lost contact, there were additional
dialog: Soviet mailings from Pa tjarny, Leningrad
dialog: and the Mediterranean. The Soviets have
speaker_heading: SOME --
speaker_heading: (CHECKING NOTES)

text: Flushed, Ryan sits beside Greer. Pelt turns to Greer:
speaker_heading: PELT
dialog: Conclusions?
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Absence of activity in the Pacific suggest
dialog: this is probably just an exercise having
dialog: nothing to do with the Red October.
text: A General starts to object. He's cut off by JUDGE MOORE, a
text: white-haired civilian near the top of the table:
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: NSA can speak to that, Mr. Pelt.
speaker_heading: PELT
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: I must emphasize the extremi ' sensitivity
dialog: of this information and ask that on no

speaker_heading: (PELT NODS)
dialog: Before sailing, Captain Ramius sent a
dialog: letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin, Chairman
dialog: of Soviet Naval Deployment.
text: Painting at Ramius' wedding picture, Ryan whispers to Greer:
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: That's her uncle!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: Whose uncle?
speaker_heading: RYAN
speaker_heading: (WHISPEG)
dialog: Ramius' wife. Padorin's her uncle!
text: Greer has no idea what Ryan's saying. Moore's still talking:
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: The contents of the letter are unknown,
dialog: but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded
dialog: a meeting with Premier Ligachev and
dialog: within minutes of that meeting, the
dialog: Soviet Fleet sailed with orders to find

speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: And sink her.

speaker_heading: RECOVER:
speaker_heading: PELT
dialog: Sink her?
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL
dialog: My god. They've got a madman on
dialog: their hands. He's gonna start a war.
text: A spirited discussion ensues. Tuning it out, Ryan stares at the
text: picture of Ramius and his wife. Urgently, he whispers to Greer:
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: This is the twenty-gird, isn't it?
text: Greer nods. Order in the room has broken down. Generals and
text: Admirals argue vehemently about appropriate. responses. Staring at
text: the photos, a light goes off in Ryan's brain:
text: SljenCel. Ryan realizes everyone in the room is staring at him.
speaker_heading: PELT
speaker_heading: (DRYLY)
dialog: You've something to add to the
dialog: discussion, Dr. Ryan? _
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Uhhmm...I was just thinking there

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
text: Ramius might be trying to defect.
text: Nobody moves. Ryan glances at Greer. Greer rolls his eyes. Too

speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: Do you mean to suggest -
speaker_heading: PELT
dialog: Go ahead, Dr. Ryan.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Well, Ramius trained most of their Officer
dialog: Corps. He'd be in a position to sect

dialog: Russian.
speaker_heading: (WARMING UP)
dialog: He's Lithuanian by birth, and by heritage.

speaker_heading: ADMIRAL
dialog: Four days.

dialog: Alright. I'll brief the President.
dialog: That will, be all, gentlemen.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Dr. Ryan. Would you stay for a
dialog: moment, please?
text: Everyone gets up to leave. As Greer rises, he winks at Ryan:
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: I said speak your mind, Jack, but
speaker_heading: JESUS --
text: shaking his head, Greer pats Ryan's shoulder and leaves. Ryan's
text: mouth is dry. Pelt gets up:
speaker_heading: PELT
dialog: You slammed the door on the General
dialog: pretty hard, Jack.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It wasn't my intention, sir -
speaker_heading: PELT
speaker_heading: (GRINNING)
dialog: Yes it was. He was patronizing you
dialog: and you stomped on him. In my
dialog: opinion, he deserved It.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Look, I'm a politk:ian, Jack. That
dialog: means I'm a liar, a cheat and when
dialog: I'm nvt kissing babies I'm stealing
dialog: their lallipops. But it also means
dialog: I know people and keep my options open.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Let's assume for a minute that you're
dialog: right and he intends to defect What
dialog: do you think we should do?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Well, somebody has to go out and try- -
dialog: to contact him.
speaker_heading: PELT
dialog: OK. When can you leave?
speaker_heading: RYAN
speaker_heading: (FLUSHED)
dialog: Wait a minute. The General was right.
dialog: I'm just an analyst --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PELT
dialog: Perfect. I can't ask any of these

speaker_heading: (RYAN FROWNS)

speaker_heading: RYAN
