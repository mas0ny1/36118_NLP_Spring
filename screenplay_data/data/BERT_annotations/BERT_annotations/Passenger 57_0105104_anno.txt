speaker_heading: 1A CLOSEUP - MAN'S FACE 1A
text: Handsome. Capable-looking. Sharp, chiseled features. But it's the eyes that grab you. They're the coldest, crudest eyes you've ever seen and they belong to CHARLES RANE, known in the terrorism trade as "Wolfgang." On the Interpol Hit Parade, Wolfgang is number one with a bullet.
speaker_heading: DR. BAUMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Close, please.
text: Wolfgang closes his eyes. A felt-tip pen ENTERS FRAME and begins to make precise marks on Wolfgang's features. These are the marks of a skilled plastic surgeon, mapping out the operation he intends to perform. Everything about Wolfgang's face will change.
speaker_heading: DR. BAUMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Open.
text: Wolfgang opens his eyes. No amount of surgery can change them. They remain cold, cruel and penetrating.
speaker_heading: DR. BAUMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Well?
text: A mirror ENTERS FRAME. Wolfgang smiles at his marked-up image, eyes gleaming with wicked pleasure. This is one scary guy.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: I think I'm going to like the new me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 2 INT. SURGERY 2
text: Darkness. Then -- BOOM! --a big overhead light comes on, illuminating Wolfgang who reclines in a custom operating chair surrounded by gleaming high-tech equipment and a surgical team headed by DR. MICHAEL BAUMAN, the Florida Gulf coast's foremost plastic surgeon.
text: Dr. Bauman looks at the wall clock. Two minutes 'til noon. Bauman wipes some sweat from his lip and adjusts his surgical mask.
speaker_heading: BAUMAN
dialog: Sedate the patient.
text: An enter TANK HISSES to life.
scene_heading: 3 EXT. CLINIC GROUNDS - DAY 3
text: Bauman's beautiful hacienda-style hospital is located high in the Palisades overlooking the ocean. Without noise or fanfare, three SWAT vans arrive ON the SCENE.
speaker_heading: 4 SURGERY 4
text: A nurse prepares to place the ether mask over Wolfgang's nose and mouth. But the patient has other ideas. Wolfgang reaches up and catches the nurse by the wrist.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: (politely)
dialog: That won't be necessary. I intend to stay awake.
text: The surgical team reacts with shocked surprise.
speaker_heading: 5 INT. CORRIDOR 5
text: SWAT commandos are on their way, moving with swift, military precision -- each commando armed with the latest in high-tech weaponry.
speaker_heading: 6 SURGERY 6
text: Bauman is flustered by Wolfgang's refusal to be sedated.
speaker_heading: BAUMAN
dialog: You don't understand. The work I have to do -- the pain involved --
text: Pain is Wolfgang's favorite word. He smiles his Death's Head smile.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Pain is something I've learned to live with.
text: It's all there in Wolfgang's eyes. Not just pain but the pleasure of pain. Wolfgang can't wait for Bauman to cut into him! Bauman realizes he's dealing with one weird motherfucker and wisely decides to humor him.
speaker_heading: BAUMAN
dialog: All right. Let's proceed.
text: A scrub nurse presents an operating tray to Bauman. On it are an assortment of strange scalpels and instruments. Bauman shoots a nervous look at the clock -- thirty seconds 'til noon -- and selects a wicked-looking scalpel.
speaker_heading: 7 CORRIDOR 7
dialog: SWAT commandos converge on the door marked "Surgery."
speaker_heading: 8 SURGERY 8
text: Bauman bends over Wolfgang. He brings up the scalpel, his hand shaking ever so slightly. A drop of sweat falls from Bauman's forehead and lands on Wolfgang's lower lip. Wolfgang's tongue darts out and licks it away.
text: Bauman and Wolfgang lock eyes. Wolfgang knows that Bauman has set him up.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: The patient lived. But I'm afraid we lost the doctor.
text: Wolfgang's hand darts up like a cobra, grabs the scalpel and thrusts it into Bauman's neck. Bauman screams and staggers back, spraying blood. The surgical team recoils in horror.
text: At that moment, the door is kicked open by SWAT.
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
dialog: Freeze!
text: Wolfgang is already on his feet. He takes two long strides, dives through the air and CRASHES through a wall of smoked GLASS.
speaker_heading: 8A ADJOINING ROOM 8A
text: Wolfgang hits the floor in a shower of glass, scrambles to his feet and bursts through a door, knocking over a nurse.
speaker_heading: 8B INT. CORRIDOR 8B
text: Terrified patients and staff flatten themselves against the walls as Wolfgang comes charging down the corridor, half-naked, surgical gown flapping behind him, pursued by a wave of SWAT commandos.
speaker_heading: 9 thru 11 OMITTED
speaker_heading: 12 ANGLE 12
text: Wolfgang rounds the bend. At the end of the corridor is an elevator -- its doors have begun to separate. It's Wolfgang's only chance.
text: Wolfgang races for the elevator, bare feet slapping marble. He's halfway there when the elevator doors slide open to reveal a second team of SWAT cops. They spill out with weapons drawn, ready to open fire.
text: Wolfgang puts on the brakes. The first SWAT team arrives from behind and Wolfgang is caught in the middle. One false move and he gets fragged from both directions. Oh, well. With a shrug of indifference, Wolfgang raises his hands over his head.
speaker_heading: SWAT OFFICER
dialog: You're under arrest!
text: The smile on Wolfgang's face seems to say, "Temporarily." Wolfgang begins to whistle "Pack Up Your Troubles" as SWAT cops rush forward to cuff him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 13 EXT. NIGHT SKY 13
text: Fierce RAIN. Dense clouds. First the awsome ROAR, then we see the massive underbelly of a 707 airliner as it lumbers ACROSS FRAME. Clouds thicken. The big ENGINES work hard against the storm. Suddenly, an EXPLOSION rips out the bulk cargo door and the airliner hurtles to earth -- on fire and out of control -- a symphony of WIND and noise.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 13A INT. BEDROOM (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT 13A
text: JOHN CUTTER sits upright in bed, jolted from the nightmare. His eyes are wide with fear.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Lisa...
text: Cutter's naked chest is soaked with sweat and his heart is pounding like a jackhammer. The annoying sound in his ears is the BUZZ OF his ALARM CLOCK.
dialog: Cutter SHUTS OFF the ALARM. 6 A.M.
text: Cutter looks around. Nothing to worry about. He's alone in his own bedroom, bathed in the blue glow of a TV test pattern. Cutter runs a hand through his damp hair. He's a black man in his late 20s -- handsome and muscular --but unable to shake the nightmare that has haunted him for two years.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: I gotta get some new dreams.
speaker_heading: ANGLE WIDENS.
text: The room is pretty much bare. Bed, nightstand and a Solo-flex exercise set-up. Cutter is a man of few possessions. The walls are covered with a variety of bulls-eyes and target silhouettes -- the kind used by law enforcement. Each one is expensively framed -- Cutter's idea of art.
speaker_heading: The ALARM GOES OFF AGAIN.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I heard you the first time.
text: Cutter SHUTS OFF the ALARM and climbs out of bed. He goes to the Solo-flex and begins a rigorous workout --pumping iron to keep the chaos inside him at bay. As Cutter battles the weights, we PUSH IN ON the nightstand...
speaker_heading: 13B FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH 13B
text: of Cutter and a beautiful young woman in happier times. Perhaps this is "Lisa." Next to the photo is an Amtrack brochure and a ticket -- round trip -- Los Angeles to Orlando. But it's the Amtrak brochure that really catches our attention. It's illustrated with a bold drawing of a powerful locomotive. PUSH IN ON the train as we...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: 13C EXT. TRESTLE BRIDGE - DAY (STOCK) 13C
text: Darkness. Then... a real train bursts out of tunnel and hurtles PAST CAMERA. It crosses a span somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, headed east.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 14 thru 16 OMITTED
scene_heading: 17 INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY LOCKDOWN - NIGHT 17
text: RAIN streaks a window re-enforced with steel mesh. THUNDER CRASHES!
text: Bars slide open with a LOUD CLANG. CAMERA FOLLOWS a distinguished, silver-haired ATTORNEY as he enters the bowels of a prison designed in hell. He travels down a long corridor lined with cells containing the evil and the insane. They jeer, laugh, taunt and spit at the Attorney as he runs their gauntlet of abuse.
text: At the end of the corridor, a stem-faced guard stands in front of an iron door. The Attorney, wiping spit off his expensive suit with a handkerchief, shows the indifferent guard some papers. The guard wheels open the heavy iron door.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS the Attorney into a small dark room. The iron DOOR CLANGS shut behind him. On the other side of a mesh screen sits Wolfgang, stripped naked, wearing handcuffs. His body is hard and muscular, a map of ugly scars. He greets his Attorney with a wolfish smile.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: what's wrong, Martin? Haven't you ever seen a naked man before?
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: How can you be so calm? They know who you are.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Knowing it and proving it are two different things.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: Will you listen to me? They can prove it. They've got the Welshman.
dialog: Wolfgang's eyes cloud. They do that when something displeases him.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: ATTORNEY
dialog: The N.S.A. has him in protective custody. He's connected you to Islamic Jihad, the American Embassy bombing in Beirut and God knows what else. They're flying you to Los Angeles to stand trial.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Then the solution's simple. I must not reach Los Angeles.
dialog: ON Wolfgang's confident look...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 18 EXT. TRANS PACIFIC AIRLINES BUILDING (ORLANDO) - DAY 18
text: The logo of Trans Pacific atop a tower of glass and steel. ANGLE DOWN TO street level as a taxi pulls up to the entrance and stops. John Cutter climbs out. We see him full figure in a dark suit -- ramrod straight --lean, hard and muscular. Cutter pays the driver, hefts his bag and enters the building.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 18A INT. SLY DELVECCHIO'S OFFICE 18A
text: An efficient young SECRETARY looks up from her computer as Cutter steps into the outer office. He tosses his bag on the couch.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: You must be Mister Cutter. Mister Delvecchio's expecting you.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Don't buzz him. I want this to be a surprise.
text: Cutter crosses the room and pushes open the big door to...
speaker_heading: 18B SLY'S INNER OFFICE 18B
text: Cutter is barely through the door when SLY DELVECCHIO jumps him from behind.
text: In a blinding flash of martial arts skill. Cutter flips Sly over his shoulder. Sly hits the carpet with a thud. Swift as a cobra, Cutter is upon him -- knee planted in the center of Sly's chest, hand tight around Sly's throat -- thumb pressed to his jugular.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: You're dead. Sly. Get yourself buried.
text: Through his surprise and pain, Sly smiles back. He's in his early 30s, a friendly, likable guy -- Cutter's buddy from way back.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: (his voice is a rough whisper)
dialog: Okay, I'm dead. Now would you mind getting your big knee off my chest?
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: I can't breathe...
text: Cutter just smiles as Sly continues to gasp. Sly is very convincing but Cutter's not buying. He knows his friend too well.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: Cutter... please... I can't breathe...
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Sly, do the words 'acting lessons' mean anything to you?
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: (really gasping)
dialog: Cutter, no shit... you know I've got this asthma thing...
text: Cutter frowns and steps back. As he does, sneaky Sly tries to hook him with his foot. But Cutter has anticipated this. He catches the foot with one hand and hoists Sly into the air so that he's hanging upside down -- face buried in the rug.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (amused)
dialog: How's that carpet taste?
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: All right! Okay! Uncle!
text: Sly's Secretary appears in the doorway, alarmed to see her boss in this most undignified position.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Mister Delvecchio? Should I call Security?
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: (upside down)
dialog: Ellen, I am Security.
dialog: (then; chuckling)
dialog: Don't worry. It's just a couple of Navy buddies catching up on old times.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: We're bonding.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: (to Cutter)
dialog: You want something? Coffee? Tea?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I'm fine.
dialog: (to the Secretary)
dialog: But you'd better bring Mister Delvecchio some Therapeutic Mineral Ice. He's not as young as he thinks he is.
text: The Secretary nods and backs away. Cutter releases Sly and lets him crumple to the floor. With a groan. Sly gets to his feet. He straightens his suit and tie in a dignified manner.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: Okay. So I'm a little rusty. But you... you sonovabitch...
text: Sly and Cutter regard each other soberly, then break out laughing. They embrace.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I think you put on some weight.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: Corporate life. I think you lost some.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: You ever tried the food at Forrestal?
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: Forrestal. Jesus, Cutter. Teaching counter-terrorism and evasion techniques to a bunch of rich guys' bodyguards and chauffeurs -- it's beneath you. What's next? Church Groups? Cub Scouts?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Maybe. How much do they pay?
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: It's not you. Cutter.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: It's me, Sly -- the new me. And the new me happens to like teaching. It's got some great perks.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: Name one.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: You want to know what I like best? It's make-believe. The danger is pretend. Strictly hypothetical. Nobody gets hurt -- especially me.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: You ever hear that old expression? 'Those who can -- do. Those who can't -- teach.'
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: I know you. Cutter, and you're no teacher.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Then I'm in big trouble because the idea of being a 'do-er' again makes me break out in a cold sweat.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: 'You fall off a horse, you get back on.'
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Sly, don't you know any new expressions?
dialog: The Secretary returns.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Mister Delvecchio -- your meeting with Mister Ramsay.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: (looks at his watch)
dialog: Better hustle.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Look, Sly, I'm not even sure I want this job. The idea of getting back in the shit doesn't exactly thrill me.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: I need you, Cutter -- and you need this job.
dialog: It's the truth. ON Sly's imploring look...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 18C INT. ATRIUM - DAY 18C
text: Sly and Cutter wind their way through an in-door botanical garden that doubles as a dining area for the employees of Trans Pacific.
speaker_heading: SLY
text: Ramsay is Stuart Ramsay, the guy above me -- President of Operations. To get the airlines anti-terrorism unit off the ground, we're gonna need Ramsay's support. He's a slick prick but he can be handled. You've done these dog and pony shows before so you know the drill. Nod. Smile. Jump through a few hoops.
text: STUART RAMSAY rises from a table to greet them. He's in his thirties, handsome, immaculately groomed and styled. Stuart Ramsay's only real interest in life is his own survival in the corporate jungle. In this respect he is ruthless. He can also be quite charming.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: Welcome to the jungle.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: Stuart, meet John Cutter.
dialog: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: (friendly)
dialog: John -- I'm a big fan.
text: Cutter smiles. He knows a shark when he sees one.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 18D SAME SCENE - SOME MINUTES LATER 18D
text: Cutter, Sly and Ramsay are deep in discussion.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: These are facts. Over the last year, there's been a forty percent increase in terrorist actions against Trans Pacific. Most of these incidents occurred in-flight. Most of them could have been prevented.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: By doing what the Israelis do... having trained security specialists 'ride shotgun' on all international and coast-to-coast flights.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: I hope you aren't suggesting we put armed guards on our planes. Our passengers would never stand for it.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I'm not talking about armed guards. I'm talking about trained counter-terrorists -- disguised as passengers. Their identities would be known only to the flight crew. You want to stop terrorism?
speaker_heading: CUTTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Then you gotta send a message. Let the terrorists know you're not afraid to fight back.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Maybe we could use it as an advertising gimmick. 'Fly Trans Pacific -- We'll Get You There Alive.'
dialog: (a friendly smile)
dialog: John... air travel is supposed to be a pleasant and relaxing experience. We don't want the public to think their lives are in danger every time they get on a plane.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: But their lives are in danger.
text: Cutter knows this only too well. Ramsay considers for a moment.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: (turns to Sly)
dialog: He doesn't pull his punches, does he? What do you think?
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: I'm with John. I've worked up some numbers and it's not as expensive as you might think. Not in the long run.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: Well, you guys are the experts... but it seems kind of extreme to me.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Terrorism is a growth industry, Mister Ramsay. It should be your number one priority.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: I can understand why you feel that way.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: You can?
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: You've been a victim of terrorism yourself.
text: Caught slightly off-guard. Cutter turns to Sly.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: I told him about Lisa.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: I'm very sorry for your loss. I know it's got to be painful.
dialog: Cutter nods, remains stoic.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
text: It's been two years. I'm not over it -- I never will be -- but I can talk about it now. Yeah. I'm a victim of terrorism. Pan International Flight 107. The ironic part is, I wasn't on a job. I was on my honeymoon. We were halfway to Buenos Aires when a bomb went off in the cargo hold. One second we're making jokes about the lousy food. The next...
dialog: (too painful; stick to the facts)
dialog: One hundred and forty-two people lost their lives. Twenty-seven survived. They tell me I was lucky but the truth is, a big part of me died in that crash.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: I apologize. I know this is a sensitive area. But I have to know if your own experience has made you a bit... over-zealous when it comes to airline security.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: If anything it's made me realize that terrorism isn't something that only happens to other people. It can happen to any of us... at any time.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: I appreciate your honesty. One more question and we're through.
dialog: (a slight beat)
dialog: Do you always travel by train?
text: Sly sits up like he's been stuck with a red-hot poker. How the hell did Ramsay know that? Even Cutter looks perplexed... until he follows Ramsay's eyes to the Amtrak brochure poking out of his breast pocket. Cutter removes it, playing for time.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: You mean this?
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: (butting in)
dialog: I thought I told you. Cutter took the train so he could have time to relax and work on his presentation. But he's returning to L.A. tonight -- by air.
dialog: (giving Cutter a strained look)
dialog: The six o'clock flight, I believe.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (playing along)
dialog: Right. The six o'clock.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: Well, that's a relief.
dialog: (joking)
dialog: We wouldn't want to hire an airlines security specialist who's afraid to fly.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: We'd have to be pretty crazy to do a thing like that.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Stark raving mad.
speaker_heading: Ramsay's WATCH goes BEEP.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: Guys, I'm late.
dialog: (standing)
dialog: John -- most impressive. Sly and I will run your ideas by Addison Cale and see what the old man thinks. I hope the next time I see you will be to welcome you on board.
dialog: (they shake hands)
dialog: Have a nice flight.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Thanks.
text: But Ramsay is gone. Cutter and Sly exchange uneasy smiles.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: You think he bought it?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: He's an asshole but he's not a fool.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: I know him. He'll check to see if you're on the plane. I'd better make you a reservation.
dialog: (calling to a waiter)
dialog: Phone!
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Don't bother.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: (as if betrayed)
dialog: You gonna make me a liar?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Oh, man. Don't give me that look.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: What look?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: What look? The 'Please, mister, don't shoot my puppy' look. Forget it. Sly. I agreed to come here and take a meeting. That's all. Nobody said nothin' about flyin' on a plane. So don't try to talk me into it because my mind's made up. And don't try any of your blackmail tricks.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: Fine. End of discussion.
text: A waiter arrives with a cordless phone. Sly takes it and punches some numbers.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Honey, it's me. I think you should put the house up for sale...
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Aw, man...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 18E EXT. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - ARRIVAL ZONE - DAY 18E
text: A convertible pulls INTO FRAME and stops. Sly is at the wheel. He turns to Cutter in the passenger seat and tries not to smile.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Get it straight, you smug sonovabitch. I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for me.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: What? You're not even gonna say thanks ?
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: Why should I? You're not doing it for me. You're doing it for you.
text: Cutter shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I gotta get some new friends.
text: Sly breaks into a happy smile.
speaker_heading: SLY
dialog: Thanks, flyboy. You're saving both our asses.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (like it's no big deal)
dialog: Hey, it's just a little plane ride. A couple hours from now we'll be talking on the phone and laughing about it.
text: Cutter reaches over and squeezes Sly's neck affectionately. They shake hands. Cutter gets out, hefts his bag and enters the terminal.

speaker_heading: 19 thru 28 OMITTED
scene_heading: 29 EXT. TERMINAL 5 - PARKING BAY 29
text: A Trans Pacific 747 is being prepped for flight. FROM an OVERHEAD ANGLE the jumbo jet looks like a patient on life support with all the machinery and vehicles hooked up to it -- tow tractor, fuel truck, cargo belt loaders, cabin/galley and lavatory service -- all coming and going with swift, military precision.
speaker_heading: 30 ANGLE 30
text: A Sky Cuisine catering truck is parked alongside the 747. A fat man wearing orange coveralls pushes a food cart into the open cargo door of the plane. Then he goes back for the next cart. Making sure no one's watching, the fat man produces a square metal package, slips it into the bottom tray of the cart and pushes the cart into the plane.
scene_heading: 31 INT. 747 - LOWER GALLEY 31
text: The plane's lower galley is accessible by a small elevator located mid-ship.
text: Two flight attendants steer the food carts into their bays. MARTI SLAYTON is in her mid-twenties -- dark, very pretty, friendly and outgoing. FIONA RITCHIE is Irish, a tall, hard-bodied redhead.
speaker_heading: MARTI

speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Fiona Ritchie. I just transferred from London/Chicago.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: (as they work)
dialog: Single?
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Don't rub it in.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Then you'll like Orlando/L.A.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Pretty good pickings, huh?
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: It's got its rewards --if you can recognize the bullshit artists. Not that I'm an expert. Last week I met this guy. Cute. No ring. Says he's in town for one night and doesn't know a soul...
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Sounds familiar.
speaker_heading: MARTI
text: We go out. Dinner. Dancing. Then a stroll on the beach. The moon's out. Very romantic. He takes my hand, looks deep into my eyes and says --
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: (imitating a male voice)
dialog: 'Uh, Marti, I think I should tell you -- I'm married but my wife and I have an understanding.'
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: (nods)
text: Next thing, he's sitting in the surf checking for loose teeth. Like he's surprised I decked him.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Good for you.
dialog: They both laugh.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: I probably would've cut his balls off.
text: Say what? Marti gives Fiona a look. Fiona smiles brightly as if to say, "Just kidding." Marti nods and goes back to work.
text: The smile fades from Fiona's face. She shoots a glance at the last food cart -- the one with the package inside. Obviously, Fiona knows what's inside it.
scene_heading: 32 EXT. PARKING BAY 32
text: The Sky Cuisine truck drives away. It travels to a deserted spot under the terminal. The fat man gets out, looks around to make sure no one's watching.
text: He sheds his orange coveralls. Underneath he wears slacks and a sports jacket.
text: The Fat Man wads up the cover-alls and stuffs them into a large trash bin. He walks away. CAMERA MOVES CLOSER TO the bin. Beneath the cover-alls is the body of a man. Naked, his throat cut.
speaker_heading: 33 INT. DEPARTURE GATE 33
text: Observing the 747 through one of the big windows is a razor-thin young man wearing a black beret and a leather jacket. His face is sharp, ferret-like. His name is

speaker_heading: 35 WOLFGANG 35
text: is removed from the sedan by two cops and two no-nonsense Federal Marshals, MANNING and DUNCAN. Wolfgang wears a coat draped over his shoulders to conceal the fact that his hands are cuffed and attached to a leather belt around his waist.
speaker_heading: MANNING
dialog: (to Wolfgang)
dialog: When we say walk, you walk. When we say sit, you sit. You want something, you ask. You have to take a leak, we'll hold your dick for you.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Sounds like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
text: As they walk him to the boarding stairs, Wolfgang's eyes casually drift up to the terminal windows. He sees Vincent who flashes him a spooky smile.
scene_heading: 35A INT. TERMINAL - TICKETING AND CHECK-IN 35A
text: Cutter waits while a FEMALE AIRLINES CLERK does the computer thing. Cutter is looking a little anxious. Just being inside an airport has quickened his pulse.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I can get you on the five o'clock flight if you'd like. It'll save you sitting around for an hour.
speaker_heading: CUTTER

speaker_heading: 37 INT. 747 - UPPER DECK 37
text: CAPTAIN, CO-PILOT and NAVIGATOR arrive and enter the cockpit, closing the door behind them.
text: PAN OVER TO Manning and Duncan as they bring Wolfgang on board, showing their orders to Fiona who checks them against the manifest. The upper deck can seat up to fifty passengers but it's empty for this flight.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: We're underbooked so you'll have the upper deck all to yourselves.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: (reading her name tag)
dialog: 'Fiona.' That's Irish, isn't it? I've always loved the Irish. They make such good bombs.
text: Wolfgang gives Fiona a lascivious look.
speaker_heading: 38 INT. MAIN CABIN 38
text: Passengers are boarding. In a SERIES OF SHOTS, we get to know the layout of the jumbo jet's main cabin. There are two different sections down here -- first class and beyond it, the much larger coach section.
text: A staircase behind first class leads to the flight deck and the upper deck (where Wolfgang, Manning and Duncan are settling in). This 747 can carry five hundred passengers but tonight's flight is spotty.
scene_heading: 39 INT. BOARDING BRIDGE 39
text: Cutter walks down the jetway, surrounded by cheerful, chattering travelers. Cutter feels like a lamb on its way to the slaughter.
speaker_heading: 40 INT. 747 - MAIN CABIN 40
text: Marti welcomes passengers onboard, verbally numbering each one to get a head count.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: 55... 56...
text: Cutter appears... "57." He shows Marti his boarding pass. Between them, a slight flicker of attraction.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Hello, Mister... Cutter. Down the aisle and to your right.
text: Cutter moves on. Behind him is a Big American Indian, tall and powerfully built with a long black braid. The guy looks like a mountain of granite -- with a personality to match. Stoically, he shows Marti his boarding pass.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Hello, Mister... Elk Horn. Right down the aisle. Watch your head.
text: The next passenger is a long-haired kid wearing rimless glasses and lugging a big backpack. We'll call him the STUDENT. He smiles shyly and shows Marti his boarding pass.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Hello, Mister... Ernst.
speaker_heading: 41 COACH SECTION 41
text: Cutter find his seat near the rear of the plane. A window seat. His closest fellow passenger is a GRANDMOTHER across the aisle.
speaker_heading: 42 MAIN CABIN - UPPER GALLEY 42
text: The faint WHIRR of a MOTOR. The narrow elevator door opens and Fiona emerges, carrying a tray of complimentary champagne.
speaker_heading: 43 FIRST CLASS 43
text: Vincent finds his seat and settles in paying special attention to the spiral staircase that leads to the upper deck -- and Wolfgang. Fiona serves him a glass of champagne.
speaker_heading: 44 COACH 44
text: Cutter is doing fine until he hears the airtight HISS of the HATCH DOOR being sealed. The jet lurches into motion and backs away from the gate. Cutter remains calm, assuring himself that he'll be fine.
text: At the front of the cabin, Marti speaks into a MICROPHONE .
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, we are now preparing for departure. Please make sure that all carry-on luggage is stored safely in the overhead compartments. Make sure your seatbelts are fastened and please extinguish all cigarettes.
speaker_heading: 45 EXT. TAXI LANE 45
text: The 747 rolls along a strip of concrete that parallels the take-off runway.
speaker_heading: MARTI (V.O.)
dialog: Once we reach our cruising altitude, we'll be serving our complimentary beverages and then a little later, our dinner. Thank you and have a safe, enjoyable flight.
speaker_heading: 46 FLIGHT DECK 46

speaker_heading: TOWER (V.O.)
dialog: T.P. 694, you are clear for take off.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Roger, tower.
text: The 747 starts down the runway, speed increasing knot by knot until everything beyond the windscreen starts to blur.
speaker_heading: 47 UPPER DECK 47
text: Wolfgang sits in a center row between Manning and Duncan. He closes his eyes and settles back to enjoy the take-off.
speaker_heading: 48 EXT. RUNWAY 48
text: The 747 leaves the runway and climbs into a dark and threatening sky.
speaker_heading: 49 INT. 747 - COACH 49
text: Climbing. Cabin vibrating. Cutter's eyes are clamped shut. But sensing something, he opens them. Across the aisle the Grandmother smiles at him, obviously amused by his discomfort.
speaker_heading: GRANDMOTHER

text: The 747 thunders overhead, headed west.
scene_heading: 51 INT. 747 - LOWER GALLEY 51
text: Marti and Fiona are propping the rolling food carts. Marti rolls one into the elevator and closes the door. The ELEVATOR WHINES into service and up she goes.
text: Once Marti is gone, Fiona goes to the special food cart. She squats down, reaches into the lower shelf and nervously removes the package.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 52 EXT. NIGHT SKY 52
text: Just like Cutter's nightmare only this time it's for real. Fierce rain. Dense clouds. First the awesome ROAR -- then we see the massive underbelly of the 747 as it lumbers INTO FRAME. The clouds thicken. The big engines struggle against the mounting storm. There is a flash of lightning.
speaker_heading: 53 INT. 747 - MAIN CABIN 53
dialog: PING! The "fasten seatbelts" light comes on.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (V.O.)
dialog: This is Captain Diehl. Folks, I've turned on the seatbelt sign. We've got some unfriendly weather up ahead and we're apt to bounce a bit. So just bear with us.
speaker_heading: 54 CUTTER 54
text: He's not doing so well. To him, every BOOM OF THUNDER is an exploding bomb. Marti appears in the aisle beside him.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: How are you doing?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (manages to smile)
dialog: Well, I'm not exactly flying the friendly skies.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Is there anything I can do to help?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: How about holding my hand?
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: (smiling sweetly)
dialog: I'm sorry, sir, but we're not allowed to do that. However, there's a three-year-old child up in First Class with a teddy bear. Maybe he'd let you borrow it. Shall I ask?
dialog: Cutter's a good sport. He knows when he's been shot down.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Right between the eyes.
speaker_heading: 54 CONTINUED: 54
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Don't forget. I'm a professional. I know all the lines.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: And all the comebacks, too.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Besides, you're married.
dialog: We see that Cutter still wears his wedding band.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I guess I should take it off one of these days.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Divorced?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Not exactly.
text: Marti looks at Cutter and she knows.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Great. Now it looks like I'm trying for sympathy.
text: LIGHTNING CRACKLES. Cutter reacts.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Damn. Can't you turn off the sound effects?
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: There's really nothing to worry about. Statistically speaking --
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Flying is still the safest form of travel.
dialog: They share a smile.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Heard it before, huh?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Thanks for trying.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Sure you don't want that teddy bear?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: It's tempting but I think I'll tough it out.
text: Marti smiles, rises from her seat and makes her way up the aisle. Cutter checks her out from behind and likes what he sees.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Yeah. Tempting.
text: Another BOOM --a flash of lightning -- and Cutter's had enough. He unbuckles and leaves his seat, making his way to the rear of the plane where he finds an unoccupied lavoratory.
speaker_heading: 55 INT. LAVATORY 55
text: Cutter bolts the door. He stares at himself in the mirror. A nervous stranger stares back.
text: In this tiny space, the SOUND OF the PLANE only increases Cutter's discomfort. He reaches into his pocket and takes out his DISC MAN. He puts on the earphones, punches play and cranks it. Loud R & B MUSIC drowns out the plane ambiance and Cutter closes his eyes, trying to get into the music, hoping it will help him forget where he is.

speaker_heading: 57 INT. 747 - FIRST CLASS 57
text: Dinner is underway. Fiona approaches Vincent. She's carrying a tray of empty glasses. Under the tray is the smuggled package. Fiona bends down and whispers in Vincent's ear-ringed ear.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Sir, it's time for the in-flight entertainment.
speaker_heading: 58 COACH 58
text: Pushing aside the curtain, Fiona leaves first class and enters coach, heading for the rear of the plane. The Indian leaves his seat and follows. So does the Student. Vincent brings up the rear, licking food off his fingers.
text: Fiona steps behind the partition wall that separates the main cabin from the rear lavatories (one of which is occupied by Cutter). There's only one person back here, a businessman who finishes up a call on one of the air phones and returns to his seat.
text: The Indian, the Student, and Vincent arrive. They acknowledge each other in a curt, professional manner.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (eager)
dialog: Unwrap the present and let's get this party started.
text: Fiona opens the metal package. Inside are several automatic pistols and a grenade.
speaker_heading: 59 UPPER DECK 59
text: Duncan holds a spoonful of spinach to Wolfgang's mouth.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Eat your spinach or no dessert.
text: Manning chuckles. We RACK FOCUS. Behind them, silently ascending the spiral staircase is Vincent. Vincent raises his gun and takes aim at the back of Manning's head. The plane is bouncing and he'll have to be good to make a shot like this. He is.
text: Manning is to take his next bite when -- POP! --a BULLET enters the back of his head and comes out between his eyes. He slumps forward.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: He shoots, he scores!
text: As Duncan reacts to his partner's death, Wolfgang clamps his teeth down on the spoon, rips it free of Duncan's fingers and lunging forward, drives the end of the spoon into Duncan's left eyeball, savagely tearing upward into Duncan's brain.
speaker_heading: 60 BELOW - FIRST CLASS 60
text: The GUNSHOT has caused a chain reaction of panic throughout the entire ship. Fiona appears in first class.

speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Put your heads down!
speaker_heading: 61 UPPER DECK 61
text: Wolfgang pulls away from Duncan, the spoon (now bent) still clamped between his teeth. As Duncan writhes in agony, Vincent steps up and FIRES a bullet into his chest, finishing him.
text: Wolfgang spits out the spoon and smiles at Vincent, his teeth flecked with Duncan's blood.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: I hate spinach.
speaker_heading: 62 COACH 62
text: The Indian and the Student aim their guns at the now hysterical passengers.
speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Put your heads down! Heads down now!
text: A macho man passenger stands up to protest and the Indian treats him to a brutal pistol whipping. Terrified, the other passengers put their heads down.
speaker_heading: 63 UPPER DECK 63
text: Vincent finds the key in Duncan's pocket and unlocks Wolfgang's handcuffs. Wolfgang tosses the cuffs away and stands, stretching like he just got up from a restful nap. He holds out his hand like a surgeon awaiting a scalpel. Vincent slaps a gun into it.
speaker_heading: 64 FIRST CLASS 64
text: A terrified WOMAN turns to the passenger beside her --a burly, florid-faced Catholic PRIEST who, oddly, is casually sipping a cocktail and popping peanuts into his mouth.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Father --do something!
text: The Priest pats her thigh in a most un-Priestlike manner. *
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Excuse me. I'm needed by the man upstairs.
text: The Priest downs his drink, stands up and brushes the crumbs off his garment. He smiles at Fiona who allows him to climb the staircase to the upper deck, passing Vincent on his way down. They nod at each other in recognition.
speaker_heading: 65 FLIGHT DECK 65
text: The Captain reacts to a throbbing emergency light.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: We've got a security problem.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG (0.S.)
dialog: Not anymore.
text: They turn as Wolfgang steps into the cockpit and FIRES three perfect headshots. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. He's just executed the flight crew!
text: Priest, still chewing peanuts, enters the cockpit. He shoves the Captain's corpse aside and settles into his seat. Priest puts on the Captain's headset and starts punching a new flight plan into the ship's computer.
text: Wolfgang puts on a headset and activates the P.A. SYSTEM. His voice BOOMS through the airliner. We INTERCUT:
speaker_heading: 66 SHOTS OF TERRIFIED PASSENGERS 66
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG (V.O.)
dialog: Your attention please. By now you've noticed four people with automatic weapons. A word of advice for those of you too dense to grasp the obvious. These people are killers. Obey them and you will live. Disobey them and you will die. Have a nice flight.
speaker_heading: 67 FIRST CLASS 67
text: At gunpoint, Vincent and Fiona herd first-class passengers into the coach section.
speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: FIONA

dialog: Sit down, bitch, or I'll blow your tits off.
text: She means it, too. Marti sits down.
speaker_heading: 69 INT. LAVATORY 69
text: Cutter, eyes still closed, hasn't heard a thing in here, grooving on the music from his Disc Man. The last track comes to an end and Cutter opens his eyes. He looks at himself in the mirror. He smiles, feeling relaxed and relieved. The music has worked so well he's wondering why he was ever nervous in the first place.
text: Cutter removes his earphones. Feeling confident now, he opens the door, ready to return to his seat and ride out the flight. But before he's halfway out, he hears...
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (to the passengers)
dialog: Just be cool and maybe you'll live!
text: Instinctively, Cutter ducks down and crouches behind the partition. What the hell's going on? Cutter eases over to the edge and peers around the comer. He sees that the terrorists have re-located all passengers to the Coach section of the main cabin.
dialog: Cutter ducks back. Talk about a worst case scenario.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: This is not happening.
text: But it is happening and Cutter knows he's got to do something. Thinking hard, his eyes drift up to the air phones.

text: Staff are busy dealing with the problem, shouting at each other and into phones. Video and communications equipment arrives. In the middle of this madhouse Stuart Ramsay arrives in mid-conversation with a top EXECUTIVE.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: Who authorized his transit on our airline?
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: You know how it works. The fucking F.B.I, shows up at the airport, they flash their badges and bully their way on board whatever flight they like. We're powerless to stop them.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: They'll take full responsibility for this one, believe me.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Unfortunately, Stuart, the public will blame us.
text: Ramsay turns as a tall, imposing gray-haired man in his early seventies enters... ADDISON CALE, the Chairman and C.E.O. of Trans Pacific. Cale does not look pleased.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: Addison.
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Who fucked up?
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: Isn't it a little early to start looking for a scapegoat?
speaker_heading: CALE
dialog: Stuart, in my experience, it's never too early.
dialog: Ramsay sees a way out.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: Sly Delvecchio's our V.P. in charge of airline security. Talk about a coincidence. Just today I was telling him how we need an anti-terrorism unit to handle situations like this.
speaker_heading: CALE

speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Four terrorists have taken over the plane.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: Cutter, don't do anything rash.
speaker_heading: RAMSAY
dialog: Just follow my instructions. I want you to make your presence known and contact the leader. Tell him you have the President of Trans Pacific on the line. I'm here with the Chairman and we're willing to negotiate.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Ramsay, you don't negotiate with terrorists.
dialog: (the truth)

speaker_heading: RAMSAY

speaker_heading: SLY

speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (shouting like a crazy man)
dialog: I'll kill him! Swear to God I'll blow his goddamn brains out!
text: Passengers scream and duck as Cutter frog-marches the Student up the aisle. Vincent, Fiona and the Indian are unsure what to do. Cutter looks positively rabid.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Don't fuck with us, man! Let him go or we start offing people!
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (raving)
dialog: You think I give a shit about them? Hell, I may take out a few myself just for kicks! Now pull those curtains and move back! Move back or I'll blow a window and suck everybody's ass into space!
text: Cutter aims his gun at a window.
speaker_heading: VINCENT

text: Vincent opens the curtains to first class. He, Fiona and the Indian retreat into the empty area, keeping their guns on Cutter who shoves the dazed Student in front of him.
speaker_heading: 81 FIRST CLASS 81
text: As Cutter and the Student enter, Vincent shouts up the stairway to the flight deck.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Wolfgang!
text: Wolfgang. Cutter recognizes the name and realizes he's in very dangerous company. Marti, up and out of her seat, watches from a position near the upper galley.

speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: I see we have a hero.
speaker_heading: CUTTER

speaker_heading: CUTTER

speaker_heading: MARTI

speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Get down and cover your head.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: You were faking!
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: No shit! Get your ass down!

speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Stay alive.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Good plan.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG (O.S.)
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Hero! Throw out your gun or I'll start executing passengers!
text: Big problem. If Cutter throws out his gun, he and Marti are dead. If he doesn't, the passengers are. That's when Cutter notices the little elevator.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: All right -- here it comes!
speaker_heading: 83 FIRST CLASS 83
text: Cutter's gun sails out of the upper galley and lands in the aisle. Wolfgang nods at the Indian and together, they rush the upper galley.
speaker_heading: 84 UPPER GALLEY 84
text: It's empty! Wolfgang and the Indian look at each other in confusion. Then, they hear the ELEVATOR MOTOR. Wolfgang grabs the elevator door but it refuses to open.
speaker_heading: 85 LOWER GALLEY 85
text: The elevator door opens to reveal Cutter and Marti, face to face, wedged against each other like sardines.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I guess this is what they mean by 'Fly United.'
text: They untangle themselves and pop out. Cutter grabs a food cart and jams it into the doorway, making the elevator inoperative.
speaker_heading: 86 UPPER GALLEY 86
text: The Indian tries to pry the elevator doors apart with his superior strength but they won't budge. Wolfgang doesn't seem particularly upset. He gives calm instructions to Fiona and Vincent.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG

speaker_heading: MARTI

speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: We've got to find a way to bring this plane down.
text: Marti looks at Cutter in horror. Maybe he is crazy.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Down? This is a jumbo jet. You don't just bring a jumbo jet down.
text: Cutter finds the handle to the avionics compartment. He opens the hatch.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: Hey! You can't go in there.
text: Cutter ignores her and enters.
speaker_heading: 88 AVIONICS COMPARTMENT 88
text: Marti grabs Cutter from behind. They struggle and he pins her against the wall.
speaker_heading: CUTTER

speaker_heading: MARTI

dialog: Five older brothers. Let go.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Not until you promise to cool out.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: All right. I promise.

speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Now that I know I can't trust you...

speaker_heading: MARTI

speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (with conviction)
text: I'm trying to save lives. The people who've taken over this ship are killers. Their leader is a man called Wolfgang and he's only the most dangerous fucking terrorist in the world. He kills hostages and he'll wipe out everybody onboard if we don't find a way to change his plans. Yeah, bringing the jet down is dangerous. But staying in the air with that psycho is even more dangerous.
dialog: Marti considers... and decides to trust him.
speaker_heading: MARTI
dialog: So what do we do?
text: Cautiously, Cutter lets her go. Marti makes no move to attack. So Cutter crouches down and opens a small panel. Inside is a river of bright circuits and wires.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: We cut some wires.
text: Cutter searches his pockets for something sharp but has nothing that will work. Marti taps him on the shoulder. From her pocket, she produces a knife, fork and spoon sealed in plastic.

speaker_heading: 101 MID-WAY 101

dialog: Wolfgang's services are available to any group or government willing to meet his price. He hasn't got a political bone in his body. In my opinion, he is all the more dangerous because he does not align himself with any particular cause other than his own survival. And Wolfgang has the survival instincts of a cockroach.

text: Cutter turns and allows the tide of humanity to carry him toward the terminal. At the last moment, he breaks away and disappears around the side of the building.
scene_heading: 128C EXT. FRONT OF TERMINAL 128C
text: More cars are arriving. Most of them contain locals who've come to the airfield to rubberneck at the spectacle.
text: Cutter sees what he's looking for. A big BIKER and his woman come ROARING up to the curb on a monster HARLEY. The woman dismounts as Cutter arrives.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: (to Cutter)
dialog: We seen all the cars. What's goin' on?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: You'll never believe it. Some crazy black guy just stole a big redneck's motorcycle!
text: Cutter shoves the Biker to the pavement, hops into the seat, REVS the BIKE and ROARS off into the night. The Biker, sitting stupidly on the ground, can't fucking believe it.
speaker_heading: 129 EXT. FIELD 129
text: Wolfgang, Priest, Vincent and Fiona, wearing borrowed coats and hats, hurry for the light of the fairgrounds.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (curious)
dialog: What'll happen to Mister Elk Horn?
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: He'll babysit the passengers until the police rush the plane. Then he'll detonate the grenade and blow everything to kingdom come. With all those mangled body parts, no one will know we weren't on board.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: He'll do. that? Kill himself for you?
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Of course. Wouldn't you?
dialog: Priest looks uneasy.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Too bad we can't stay and watch it go 'boom.*
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Why bother? It'll be on the news for the next six months!
text: They come to a tall cyclone fence. Without hesitation, the four terrorists hit the fence, scale it and clamber down to the other side. A pasture separates them from the fairgrounds.

text: The last of the freed passengers escape to the terminal. On the 747, hatch doors close.
speaker_heading: 131 INT. 747 - MAIN CABIN 131
text: Keeping his gun trained on the fifty or so remaining passengers, the Indian seals the final hatch with his free hand. All eyes are on him. With the same hand, he pulls the grenade out of his pocket. The passengers shriek and cower. The Indian says nothing but the message is clear. "If I pull the pin, we all blow up."

text: Standing at the window, Chief Biggs is satisfied that the first half of the transaction has gone smoothly. Frank Alien thinks something's fishy.

speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: You complaining?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You gotta admit it's odd.
speaker_heading: BIGGS

dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: 132A EXT. PASTURE 132A
text: Cutter rides the HARLEY, rocketing cross-country in the direction of the fairgrounds. He's running without lights but the ROAR of the bike beneath him is like a warning bell. Wolfgang and company appear in the near distance. Cutter guides the bike with one hand. In his other hand -- the stolen gun, up and ready for action.
speaker_heading: 132B ANGLE 132B
text: Wolfgang and his crew turn and react to the fast-approaching Harley. The moonlight reveals the rider as Cutter.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: It's that crazy fucker from the plane!
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: He's not crazy.
dialog: (impressed by Cutter's moxie)
dialog: He's dead.
dialog: (whipping out his gun)
dialog: Take him out!
text: Wolfgang, Vincent, Priest and Fiona OPEN FIRE, lighting up the night.
speaker_heading: 132C ANGLE 132C
text: Cutter bears down on them, RETURNING FIRE. They scatter as Cutter comes over a rise -- and goes airborne. Vincent keeps PUMPING lead at him. One of his shots hits the FUEL TANK and it EXPLODES beneath Cutter.
text: Cutter and the flaming BIKE go CRASHING down into a deep ravine. Cutter is thrown from the Harley and hurled into the darkness.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Bullseye.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: See that he's dead and meet us at the fairgrounds.
dialog: (to Priest and Fiona)
dialog: Let's go.

text: Vincent arrives. He sees the bike -- but no Cutter.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Don't be a shy guy. Come out and play.
text: As Vincent turns to look for him, Cutter comes flying out of the darkness. He tackles Vincent and slams him to the earth. Two quick punches and Vincent is out like a light.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: You're 'it,' motherfucker.
text: Cutter stands, out of breath. He sees Wolfgang, Fiona and Priest in the distance, entering the fairgrounds. At Cutter's feet is the mangled Harley. One of the saddle-bags is open and a leather jacket is hanging out. Cutter reaches down and grabs it for a disguise.
speaker_heading: 132E EXT. FAIRGROUNDS 132E
text: CLANG! A softball hits a bullseye, RINGS a BELL and a board drops out from under a clown, dumping him in a tank of water. The crowd cheers and laughs. As the soggy Clown climbs back on his perch, we see Wolfgang, Priest and Fiona coming down the midway.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: How far to the rendezvous point?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Port Arthur, Texas? Maybe two hundred miles.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Secure some transportation. I'll call the rendezvous team and instruct them to hold their position. We'll come to them. Move.

dialog: Chief, we've got reports of gunfire coming from over near the fairgrounds.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: (rising anger)
dialog: Put them both together they spell 'Cutter.' Get some men over there and nail his ass.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 132G EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - MIDWAY 132G
text: ANGLE DOWN FROM a big banner that proclaims "COUNTY FAIR -- FIREWORKS TONITE!" In the crowd, we find Cutter on the hunt, effectively disguised in the leather jacket.
text: A LOUD SCREAM. Cutter reacts but it's only a couple of teenagers on the ferris wheel. Cutter continues on, pushing through the dense crowd. The gun in his pocket is a reassuring weight but he's clearly worried. Wolfgang and innocent people are a lethal combination.
text: We RACK FOCUS. Behind Cutter, Wolfgang steps out of a telephone booth. Like a shark, he glides silently up behind Cutter and ever so gently pokes his gun into Cutter's back. Cutter stiffens.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: (in Cutter's ear)
dialog: Lovely night. Let's go for a walk... hero.
text: Cutter does as he's told, wondering how the hell Wolfgang recognized him.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Nice 'disguise.' How did you resist wearing a neon sign?
text: They walk past a distortion mirror. Cutter glances at his reflection and sees that the back of his leather jacket is decorated with big letters that spell out "ARYAN ARMY."
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (feeling like a chump)
dialog: I gotta get some new brains.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: (amused)
dialog: I'm curious to know how a black man got into a Neo-Nazi bike gang.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I promised to introduce them to Michael Jordan.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: A sense of humor. I like that in a corpse.
dialog: (as they walk)
dialog: Now, very gently, remove the pistol from your pocket and drop it into the nearest trash receptacle. Any hesitation and I'll blow a hole through your spine. And if that's not incentive enough, I assure you I have no problem with wasting a few bystanders.
text: As they pass a trash can. Cutter carefully removes his pistol and drops it in.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Very good.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: We walk and we talk. Get to know each other. I don't usually care who I kill but in your case I'm willing to make an exception. You fascinate me. But first things first. What happened to the young man I sent to kill you?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: He's taking a nap in some cow shit.
text: They pass the carousel with its HURDY GURDY MUSIC, spinning lights and happy children. For a brief moment, Wolfgang savors the scene with an almost child-like wistfulness.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Quite a fascinating place, wouldn't you agree? I've never actually been to a county fair before. I've never even been on a carousel.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: You poor little thing. I'll bet you had a deprived childhood.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: My childhood was a nightmare.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: You're adulthood's no golden dream.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: And you're no ordinary passenger. Who are you?
dialog: (poking Cutter with the gun)
dialog: If you don't tell me, somebody will die. Maybe you... maybe one of them.
text: Cutter's blood freezes. He looks around at the happy, unsuspecting people on the midway. Teenagers. Toddlers. Moms and Dads. A whole cross-section of humanity.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Let's see. Who shall it be? The fat girl with the ice cream cone? Too easy. How about the sailor trying to impress his girl friend? Wait. Just the thing. A pair of identical twins...
dialog: Cutter simply has no choice.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: My name's John Cutter.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Don't lie. I'll know if you lie.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I'm a security specialist working for Trans Pacific. I asked the local cops to let me take you down without causing a scene. They're watching us right now.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: I hardly think so. You're a lone wolf. Cutter. I know the breed. I assume you know who I am.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: I'm your biggest fan.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: You're very clever. Very resourceful. Dumping the fuel was quite brilliant.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Thanks. I've never been complimented by a psychopath before.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Well, it takes one to know one. I could use a man like you. Cutter, but I'm sure you're hopelessly tied to some sense of morality. We're not really that different, you and me. We're both killers.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: The people I've killed were scum. They had it coming. The people you kill are innocent.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Innocent? Who says they're innocent? I'm surprised at you, Cutter. Haven't you figured it out by now? The world is a hell. It doesn't matter what we do in it.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Wolfgang, I hope you won't take this the wrong way... but you are one sick fuck... and it's gonna be a pleasure to kill you.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: (can't believe Cutter's nerve)
dialog: Kill me? Cutter, you need a reality check.
text: Fiona comes toward them. She recognizes Cutter.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Back from the dead?
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Vincent failed. Where's Priest?
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Waiting with the bus. We borrowed it from a Baptist church group.
dialog: (indicating Cutter)
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: We'll kill him on the bus and dump his body in the swamp. Let's go.
speaker_heading: 132H ANGLE 132H
text: Fiona leads Cutter and Wolfgang down the midway. In the distance sits a battered yellow church bus on the edge of the parking area, belching black exhaust fumes,
text: Cutter notices police arriving on the scene. The Cops are mingling with the crowd, obviously on the lookout. Wolfgang sees them, too.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: They're looking for me.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: They can't have you. I found you first.
text: They continue along the midway, careful not to attract attention, approaching...
speaker_heading: 132I OPEN-AIR STAGE 132I
text: Where a pie and cake auction is underway. A folksy AUCTIONEER in a cowboy suit examines the next item, a pit displayed by its creator, a twelve-year-old Cajun girl.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: (into a microphone)
dialog: What do we have here? Looks like a lovely pecan pie baked by Suzanne Belreve, a sixth grader from Natchitoches . Mnunnun, that do smell good. I'm gonna start the bidding at five dollars. Who's gonna gimme six?
text: As Cutter moves past the assembled crowd, flanked by Wolfgang and Fiona, he realizes he has to take a chance,
speaker_heading: MAN IN CROWD
dialog: Six!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER MAN
dialog: Seven!
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Seven. Do I hear eight?
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Fifty bucks!
text: The crowd lets out a collective gasp. Heads turn, seeking the owner of the voice. It's Cutter, wearing a big grin. Wolfgang and Fiona are momentarily flummoxed. They can't believe it. On stage, the Cajun girl's eyes light up with excitement. Fifty dollars!
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Did you say fifty bucks?
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (feeling generous)
dialog: What the hell, make it a hundred!
text: A bigger gasp. This attracts the attention of other people strolling the midway. They drift over to see what's going on. Even the Cops are pressing closer to see who the big spender is. Wolfgang feels his power slipping away:
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: (hissing in Cutter's ear)
dialog: Enough.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: What's that? Two hundred? Hey! My buddy here bids two hundred!
dialog: Now everybody's looking at Wolfgang!
text: Just what Cutter wanted. He takes advantage of the situation and steps away, burrowing deeper into the crowd. Wolfgang squirms. He looks like a rat trapped in a corner. This is the first time we've ever seen him flustered.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: (to Wolfgang)
dialog: Is that right, sir? Are you bidding two hundred dollars?
text: Wolfgang is in a cold fury. Even the Cops are looking at Wolfgang now, waiting for his response.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: What a cheap ass!
dialog: (stirring up the crowd)
dialog: You gonna let him get away with that?
text: Wolfgang shrinks back as people begin to jeer, giving him shit for being a phoney bidder. He gives Cutter a deadly look. Cutter returns it with a look of his own. Wolfgang turns and takes off with Fiona.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: (to Cutter)
dialog: What about you, friend? You're still at two hundred.
text: Cutter may have solved one problem but in doing so, he's created another. In the crowd. Cutter sees the Burly Airport Cop -- the one he beat up. Uh oh. The Burly Cop sees Cutter and signals the other Cops to close in.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Three hundred!
text: The Cajun girl looks at her pie. Three hundred dollars. It never occurs to her that this is a bluff.
speaker_heading: AUCTIONEER
dialog: Come on now. Fun's fun but we're talking about a pie.
text: The Cops are all around Cutter. He realizes his only avenue of escape is the stage itself.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (pushing forward)
dialog: You're right! Let me get a better look at it!
text: Cutter leaps up on the stage. That's it. The Cops have had enough. Guns come out. Wrong move. The crowd panics as the Cops rush the stage.
text: Without fear, the Cajun girl steps up happily to offer her pie to Cutter.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Hang on to that pie, kid. I'll be back for it.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: I hope.

text: Priest shoves the bus into gear. But just as it lurches into motion, two military transport trucks arrive on the scene, blocking their getaway.
text: The loading doors of the transport trucks roll open, discharging COMMANDOS with assault weapons and "FBI" stencilled on their back and chests. In their black body armor and night vision goggles, they look like invaders from hell.

text: The Cops have manged to get the Wolfgang and Fiona skulk past a games -- ring toss, water race, crowd under control. row of contests and shooting gallery, etc. Wolfgang stops at the entrance to "The House of Mirrors.' He turns to Fiona.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Are you prepared to do what's necessary?
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Wolfgang indicates the House of Mirrors.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: Go inside. In thirty seconds I want you to blow the fuck out of the place. Break every mirror and make a lot of noise. That'll bring the cops and buy me a chance. Hold them off for as long as you can, then execute yourself.

speaker_heading: CUTTER (O.S.)
dialog: Stewardess?
text: Fiona whirls and sees Cutter behind her. She FIRES and Cutter EXPLODES! Surprise! He's a mirror reflection. Before Fiona can recover, the real Cutter is upon her. He slams a fist into her beautiful, snarling face.
speaker_heading: MIDWAY
text: Wolfgang is now some distance from the House of Mirrors. He wonders why Fiona hasn't started the diversion. But it's a moot point because he's got trouble -- Commandos are coming up the midway. Wolfgang turns and looks behind him. Cutter -- fifty feet away.
text: Cutter stops. He and Wolfgang lock eyes. They hold it for a long moment. Faintly, we hear the HURDY GURDY MUSIC of the carousel. Wolfgang's eyes drift in its direction. Cutter's do likewise.
speaker_heading: 149E LONG SHOT - CAROUSEL 149E
text: With its gaily spinning lights and happy children. As Wolfgang and Cutter know, children make the best hostages.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: No. . .
text: But Wolfgang is already running for the carousel. Cutter takes off after him. He's got Fiona's gun but there's no way he can take a shot. Too many people.
text: Wolfgang collides with the ticket taker, knocking him down.
speaker_heading: 149F CAROUSEL 149F
text: Round and round go the colorful carved horses and their merry young riders. The MUSIC is LOUDER here. It seems almost demented. Suddenly Wolfgang is on board -- a wolf among sheep, seeking a victim. He zeroes in on a five-year-old boy astride a bucking bronco.
text: Wolfgang grabs the child by the back of his T-shirt, lifts him out of the saddle. In the center ring, the ride operator sees Wolfgang, the child and Wolfgang's gun. Terrified, he panics and yanks the brake -- too fast.
text: The sudden braking is too much for the over-taxed MOTOR. It BLOWS. Gears fly apart, showering sparks. The carousel begins to spin out of control, shimmying and shaking. Children scream and cling to their horses for dear life.
speaker_heading: 149G CROWD 149G
text: It watches in horror. Cutter pushes through the throng and races to the madly spinning carousel. He throws himself on board and smashes into a horse. He bounces off, crashes into another horse and is knocked around like a pinball.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Wolfgang is thrown forward against a pole. He loses his grip on the boy who drops to the spinning platform and rolls toward the edge. The ground beyond is a dangerous blur. The boy is just about to roll off when Cutter dives INTO FRAME. He grabs the boy just in time and pulls him back to safely.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (to the terrified boy)
dialog: You're okay.
speaker_heading: WOLFGANG
dialog: You should've let him fall.
text: Wolfgang is now standing over them, one hand clinging to a striped pole for support, the other clutching the gun -- aimed at Cutter and the boy. Cutter cocks his leg and kicks the pole Wolfgang is using for support. The pole splinters and Wolfgang loses his balance. He falls off the ride.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Wolfgang hits the ground and rolls for several yards. The gun flies out of his hand. It skitters across the dirt and Wolfgang lunges after it like it was a life line. As his fingers close around the gun stock, a foot comes down, trapping hand and gun.
