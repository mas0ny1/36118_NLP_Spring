dialog: Did I put it back wrong?

scene_heading: INT. MUSIC BUILDING - CONTINUING 129

text: PIANOS being played in PRACTICE ROOMS. 20 pieces at once.
text: He stops outside a door, recognizing the playing within. aA
text: smile fans across his face. He peeks through a tiny window:
text: Sure enough, Juliana is inside, practicing in this tiny room.
text: She doesn't see him. He reaches for the door.
text: Then his CEL-PHONE RINGS. Shit.
text: An instinct tells him to throw the damn thing into a trash
dialog: can. All he wants is on the other side of this door...
text: Instead, he answers the phone:
speaker_heading: ERIC (INTO CEL)
dialog: This is Eric.
speaker_heading: KATE (THRU CEL)
dialog: How fast can you get to the Field

scene_heading: INT. WFO - 5TH FLOOR - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT) 130

speaker_heading: KATE

text: So much for hello. Eric freezes in place.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're driving him?
speaker_heading: ERIC.
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Follow me.
text: She moves away. Eric hurries out of the elevator. We follow:
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I've got about five minutes; case is
dialog: ratcheting up and the Director needs
dialog: to be briefed on it.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What was on the Palm Pilot?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Everything.
text: We TRACK THEM through the 5th floor of the W.F.O. It's empty.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: The arrogant son of a bitch actually
dialog: kept a record of all of his
dialog: correspondence with the KGB, GRU, and
dialog: SVR. Last drop was two months ago.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: So he's active...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Very much so.
dialog: (they keep walking)
text: Most of the datacard is still

dialog: six-hundred thousand in cash so far,
dialog: with another eight hundred thousand

dialog: in Moscow.

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Bigot-list just got a little bigger.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We're starting air surveillance,
dialog: picket surveillance, monitoring his
dialog: phones and computers. We'll also be
text: buying the house across the street
dialog: from him and putting two agents
dialog: there.
dialog: (soberly: )
dialog: As long as he's active, every single
dialog: source we're working has to be
dialog: considered at risk: Counter-Intel and
dialog: Counter-Terrorism. He knows all their
dialog: names and locations.
dialog: (Eric nods)
dialog: Okay. Tomorrow. You'll drive him in a
dialog: Bureau vehicle. Make sure you keep
dialog: him out of the office for at least
text: three hours. We're sweeping his car.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Need to get some hard evidence on

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Ya know, he doesn't think you're
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We walked by the SIOC once; he knew
text: there was a molehunt going on in

text: ...until we find Hanssen himself, at his desk, his back
text: turned to us, holding a CORDLESS PHONE.
text: Sitting, conflicted... until he dials a number, and:
speaker_heading: HANSSEN (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Victor? Bob Hanssen... Fine, fine.
dialog: How are you?
text: We MOVE IN on him now, slowly - his face still hidden to us.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN (PHONE, CONT'D)
dialog: I have a proposal for you, Victor...
dialog: Yes, I think I've seized upon a sure-
dialog: fire way to put you into business
dialog: with the Bureau, to get a contract
text: out of them for Invicta's technology.
dialog: (pauses, then:)
dialog: Hire me as a consultant.
text: We see a quarter of his face now - just enough to know how
dialog: much he hates having to pitch himself. But...
speaker_heading: HANSSEN (PHONE, CONT'D)
dialog: No one understands your systems like
dialog: I do, no one can be a more effective
dialog: advocate for them. And I don't think
dialog: I have to tell you how much influence
dialog: I have in terms of I.T. and case-
dialog: management-security around there.
dialog: These guys are at sea without my
dialog: input, and they know it.
text: He laughs, a bit forced. CAMERA SETTLES on his profile...
speaker_heading: HANSSEN (PHONE, CONT'D)
dialog: My timetable? Well, that would be now
dialog: actually.
dialog: (trying to sound breezy)
dialog: Yes, I wanna get out of there before
dialog: my fellow Agents start inflicting a
dialog: bunch of farewell parties on me.
text: Another forced laugh... then he tightens - just heard a
dialog: polite version of "No, Thanks."
dialog: 132
dialog: 133
dialog: 134
dialog: 84,
speaker_heading: HANSSEN (PHONE, CONT'D)
dialog: I see. Well...
text: Suddenly he's become Willy Loman; it sickens him...
speaker_heading: HANSSEN (PHONE, CONT'D)
dialog: I suppose I should have been more
dialog: precise, Victor. I'm not looking for
dialog: a rich deal. And whatever you paid me
dialog: would be more than offset by the
dialog: monies I'd be bringing through the
dialog: door. It's a very lucrative contract
dialog: I'd be securing for you.
dialog: (a beat...)
dialog: Will you? Good. That's all I ask. I
dialog: know the logic of it will appeal to
dialog: you if you consider it long enough.
dialog: (it's dead, he knows it)
dialog: Thank you for your time, Victor. I
dialog: apologize for having bothered you at
dialog: home... Good night.

dialog: You gotta get back in the truck, Sir.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: Haven't you made enough mistakes for

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: it's Juliana; we've been fighting all
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Your church.
text: There it is - a big, fat lie... rooted in truth. And Hanssen,
text: despite himself, is hooked.
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: She didn't like it, Boss. It
dialog: didn't... speak to her. So I wanted
dialog: to go back to that Reading Room. I
dialog: thought there might be some books I
dialog: could get for her, to help her see
dialog: things better. I thought you might
dialog: tell me which ones to buy.
text: A long beat, cars honking all around them now...
text: And Eric can't tell if he's dead or not... until:
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Swear to God.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Swear to God that everything you just
dialog: told me is true.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Sorry, Sir. I'm not gonna do that.

dialog: I don't lie about my wife. Or the
dialog: church. If you don't know that yet

scene_heading: INT. THE SUBURBAN ~ CONTINUING 159
text: Eric's silent. Books from the "Catholic Information Center"
text: sit beside him. Hanssen eyes the Taurus, thinking...
dialog: 94,

text: Again, it's addressed to "Jack Hoschouer" in Bonn, Germany.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: This needs to be mailed.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You're not coming in, Sir?
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: I_don't have to account to you, do I?
dialog: That came out sharper than either had anticipated. Hanssen

scene_heading: 160 INT. ERIC & JULIANA'S APT, — NIGHT 160
text: Eric sits at that crappy formica table, alone. A kettle is
text: heating up on the stove. Another glass of Scotch awaits.
text: Before him is that MANILA ENVELOPE, addressed to "Jack
text: Hoschouer." Eric stares at it, conflicted.
text: Then a SHRILL WHISTLE from the kettle pierces the silence,
text: startling him. Steam pours from its spout.
text: Eric grabs the envelope, carries it to the stove...
scene_heading: 161 INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 161
text: We're on an unmarked VHS CASSETTE, with a Post-It attached:
dialog: “Jack, Think you'll like this one. Bob."
dialog: It's not too late to stuff this tape back into its envelope,
text: (which sits beside the stove in the kitchen.) Instead Eric
text: turns on his TV, and shoves in the cassette.
text: First image on the screen shocks the hell out of him: It's
text: the Hanssen bedroom, as seen from behind a DOOR of some kind,
text: shot in Hi-8 video. Bonnie lies in bed, asleep...
text: And a pit begins to form in Eric's gut.
text: On the monitor, Hanssen crosses into frame, his mid-section
text: filling it entirely. He opens the door that's been blocking
text: our view: (we now see that it was the door of their ARMOIRE. )
text: Hanssen crosses to the bed, behind Bonnie, and peels back the
text: sheets. Bonnie's in a camisole.
dialog: 162
dialog: 95.
text: He crawls in so that her body obscures our view of his, and
text: begins to fondle her. We hear AUDIO now - her soft moans...
text: Eric wants to look away, but can't.
text: Hanssen tugs her panties down. Clearly, she doesn't know
text: she's being taped. He pulls the camisole above her breasts
text: and frees himself from inside his Pajamas...
text: ++-aS a sudden SOUND startles the hell out of Eric. And us.
text: It's the front door. Juliana just came home. She has GROCERY
text: BAGS in her arms.
text: Eric leaps for the VCR, hitting STOP just as she enters the
text: room. He doesn't have time to turn the tv off... and doesn't
text: know if she caught the sound of moaning when she walked in.
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: JULIANA

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THEIR BLDG, — MOMENTS LATER 163
text: Eric emerges into the alley, disturbed as hell by what he's
text: just seen, but equally relieved that he won't have to explain
dialog: it to Juliana.
text: Then he freezes in his tracks. Just Saw something horrible:
text: Their Jeep. There aren't any grocery bags inside.
text: And he just heard the sounds of BONNIE'S MOANING coming from
text: his bedroom tv; (the room looks up into this alley.)
text: He's dead, and he knows it. He races back toward:
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THEIR BLDG. — TRACKING ERIC - CONTINUING 164
text: We're right on his back as he runs around the corner,
text: crossing their thimble-sized lawn to a walkway.
scene_heading: INT. THEIR BLDG. "LOBBY" — TRACKING ERIC - CONTINUING 165
text: He races into the building. Then down two steps, and into:
scene_heading: INT. ERIC & JULIANA'S APT, -— CONTINUING 166
text: He bursts in, breathless...
text: Juliana is right where he expected her to be: sitting on the
text: edge of the bed... watching that tape. He hurries in.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Jule...
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Honey, it's not what you're--
speaker_heading: JULIANA
text: She doesn't know she's being filmed,
dialog: does she? Look at her,
text: He hits STOP. And EJECT. She's still reeling... He throws the
text: tape and its envelope into his gym bag, zipping it shut, as:
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You shouldn't've opened this, Jule;
dialog: it could've been Classified for all
dialog: you knew.
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: If it was Classified it wouldn't be
dialog: sitting on our sink. Did he give it
dialog: to you?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: Do you find it exciting?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: God, no.
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: Is there a tape of us floating around
dialog: out there somewhere?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What?! Of course not.
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: Then can you tell me why you have it?
text: A long beat, his face working... until:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You know I can't do that.
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: Oh. "Needs of the Bureau," is that
dialog: it? This is a case of some kind?
dialog: She said that sarcastically... But he just tightened, without
text: meaning to. And that tells her something.
dialog: ..-which means he'd better get out of here.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (heads for the door)
dialog: I gotta go.
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: Wait a minute.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I'm not sure when I'll be back.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: Is this what you want, Eric?
text: That threw him. He stops at the door.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: This. Doing a job where lying to your
dialog: wife is just business as usual. Is
dialog: that who you want to be?
dialog: That's a larger question than he was prepared for...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: This ds ass special circumstance.
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: I'm not talking about Hanssen. He's a
dialog: creep, I knew that already. I'm
dialog: talking about the Jife,
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: There's gotta be some other way you
dialog: can serve your country where you
dialog: wouldn't have to lie to me every day.
dialog: Wouldn't that be better?
dialog: Yes, it would be better - but he can't say so. In fact right
dialog: now he can't say much of anything, except:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I never said this was a case. Right?
text: Juliana sags. She just gave up on him.
speaker_heading: JULIANA
dialog: No. You didn't.
text: They study one another, then he goes...
scene_heading: 167 INT. KATE'S APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER 167
text: A hand raps hard on an apartment door, repeatedly. Then the
text: door is opened by Kate.
text: Eric stands in her doorway, too wound-up to say hello:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I think my wife just read herself
dialog: into the case...
dialog: 168
dialog: 99.
text: Kate throws a glare at Eric that is Hanssen-like in its
text: disdain. Eric nearly staggers from it,
text: Then she opens the door wider. He enters,
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S APARTMENT — CONTINUING 168
text: It's a clean, efficient one-bedroom, looks like it's not used
text: very often. Kate closes the front door, calmly.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm assuming that you know what a
dialog: massive fuck-up that would be.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Look, she's smart, okay? She puts
dialog: things together.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You're as much to blame as anybody,
dialog: ya know that? I'm telling so many
dialog: lies now I can't keep 'em straight
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Wanna make things easier? Next time
dialog: Hanssen gives you a package and tells
dialog: you to mail it, mail it!
text: That made his jaw drop. Utter silence. She eyes him...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: How did you...?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That was a Bureau vehicle you were in
dialog: today, Hot-Shot. It had ears.
dialog: 
text: He doesn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Jesus. Agent Burroughs, I'm... It's
dialog: what I came over to--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: The package has been re-sealed as you
dialog: found it, right? No trace that it was
dialog: ever opened, nothing that would
dialog: arouse any suspicions on the other
dialog: end?
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No. I posted it from the Bureau five
text: minutes ago. It was pristine,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We'll see.
text: There's nothing to say. He's beyond embarrassed now.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I understand that you're stressed,
dialog: Eric. Cover-cases are like that. But
dialog: Agents learn to withstand it; that's
dialog: what makes them agents. Okay?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I'm sorry. It was a--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Just so happens, we don't think
dialog: you'll have to withstand it much
dialog: longer, maybe just days.
text: Wait. That almost sounded encouraging. Eric pauses...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What makes you think so?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We pulled 300 pages of classified
text: materials out of a Lawn & Leaf Bag in
dialog: his trunk today. His next drop
text: appears to be imminent. Then he's
dialog: ours.
dialog: From despair to hope, just like that...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I'm sorry you're having problems at
dialog: home. I'd offer you some advice but
dialog: it wouldn't be worth much - I don't
dialog: even have a cat. Best I can tell you
dialog: is keep your head on and do your job;
dialog: it's your best shot at getting this
dialog: over with. Understand?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 169
dialog: 170
dialog: 101.
text: An awkward pause. There's not much to say...
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: I should go. I'm sorry to've--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's fine. I'm supposed to be the one
dialog: you bring problems to.
text: He heads for the door. She escorts him, opens it.
text: But he turns, just before leaving:
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Is it worth it?
dialog: (she's silent)
dialog: Being an agent, what it costs. Is it
dialog: worth it?
text: She weighs that one for a second, then:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Ask me when we've caught him.

speaker_heading: PLESAC
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Pull ‘em back.
text: A beat. Plesac thinks he might've heard that wrong...
speaker_heading: PLESAC
dialog: Why would I wanna do that?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I think I can still work him, Sir. I
dialog: think I can get him comfortable
dialog: enough to make that drop.
speaker_heading: PLESAC
dialog: Have you been listening the last few
dialog: hours? There is no drop. He's going
dialog: to ground. He said so in the letter.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: The letter is why he still has to
dialog: make the drop.
text: Plesac doesn't understand. Neither does Kate.
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: He wrote it ten days ago. And he
dialog: doesn't use e-mail with these guys.
dialog: That means it hasn't been sent yet.
dialog: If he doesn't make another drop, he'd
dialog: be disappearing on them without
dialog: explaining why. He'd never do that.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: They make him feel too important.
text: Not a bad point. Kate looks to Plesac.

speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Five minutes, as promised. Caught me
text: coming right out of the Metro.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Why didn't you drive?
text: That sounded drunk. And angry.
dialog: 203
dialog: 204
dialog: 205
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Juliana needed the car. I felt like
dialog: walking anyway.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Why? Something on your mind?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Not especially.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Get in. I want some company.
text: Eric pauses... asa non-descript SEDAN pulls by them. Geddes
text: is_driving it. The sedan vanishes. Eric is on his own now...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Sure.
text: Eric opens the door, climbs in. we do too.
scene_heading: INT. HANSSEN'S CAR - PARKED — CONTINUING 203
text: Eric looks Hanssen over, searching for a weapon: in Hanssen's
dialog: jacket? Inside that ankle holster?
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Where're we--
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Can I trust you?
text: Eric freezes. That was so stark, so direct...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Of course... Don't you know that?
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: I don't know what I know anymore,
text: Then Hanssen hits the gas. We move OUTSIDE ERIC'S WINDOW as
text: the Taurus pulls away. Looks like we're going for a ride...
scene_heading: EXT. D.C. - 16TH AND MORROW - MOVING - LATER NIGHT 204
text: The Taurus glides by us, against the backdrop of ROCK CREEK
text: PARK. It's huge, vast... and dark.
scene_heading: INT. HANSSEN'S CAR - MOVING - SAME 205
text: Another Andrews Sisters song plays. Hanssen taps a finger to
text: it, definitely drunk, and looks over his shoulder, out the
text: back window. They've been silent for ten minutes.
dialog: 
dialog: 206
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: It is against Bureau policy for an
dialog: Agent to consume alcohol. Ever. Even
dialog: off-duty... because an FBI Agent is
dialog: hever off-duty. That's Director
dialog: Freeh's "BrightLine Policy."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What's wrong with your car?
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Why. Ya hear something?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No. You asked me to meet you at your
text: mechanic in the morning.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Oh. I'm having it Swept. For
dialog: electronic devices.
text: Eric shrugs. Hanssen checks his rear-view mirror now.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been sensing signal bursts
dialog: coming through the radio lately. And
text: car alarms go off when I drive past.
dialog: (Eric nods)
dialog: It's not beneath the Russians to
dialog: track me. I'm tailed all the time.
dialog: They know how much I know.
text: Then, without warning, Hanssen turns left, from the middle
text: dane, into Rock Creek Park. That feels ominous.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: We goin' to the park?
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
text: It's a clear night.
text: Eric's CEL-PHONE RINGS. Hanssen glares at the sound. Eric
text: silences it quickly. They drive on,
scene_heading: INT. HANSSEN'S CAR ~ MOVING - MINUTES LATER 206
text: We drive in darkness, a frozen creek and THICK WOODS around
text: us. Eric looks around, trying to guess what's coming...
speaker_heading: HANSSEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I had eggs for breakfast this
dialog: morning, I'm behind on my tithing to
dialog: the church, I own eighteen guns.
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: My list. Thought we might see if
dialog: you'd learned enough to catch me.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Should I go on?
dialog: (Exic nods...)
dialog: Last night Victor Sheymov offered me
dialog: a job with Invicta. Two-hundred—and—
dialog: fifty-thousand a year, starting
dialog: immediately. When I was a kid my
dialog: father liked to leave me bound on our
dialog: Living Room floor until I wet my
dialog: pants... And I don't believe anything
dialog: actually happened to your mother the
dialog: night Bonnie and I came over. I think
dialog: you were somewhere else and just
dialog: didn't want to tell me.
text: That was a mouthful. Eric pauses, assessing it all as road
text: rolls under them. Awfully dark out here.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Y'ever notice how often you try to
dialog: catch me in a lie, Boss?
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: I wonder why that is.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Maybe you've spent so many years
dialog: studying spooks you can't imagine
dialog: anybody telling the truth.
dialog: (Hanssen doesn't react)
dialog: Jule and I have an Anniversary coming
dialog: up. That night I was out arranging a
dialog: surprise for her. I made up the mom
dialog: thing so she wouldn't know.
dialog: A beat. No idea if that flew or not...
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: And I'm sorry about your father.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Maybe that's the part I made up.
dialog: 207
dialog: 208
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I don't think so.
text: Hanssen breathes out a bitter laugh, then pulls the car over
text: at a secluded spot.
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: What're we doing?
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Agent-training. That's what you
dialog: wanted, right?
text: And he gets out, waiting for Eric to follow. Eric does so.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCK CREEK PARK — ROAD — CONTINUING 207
text: Hanssen crosses the road, toward a small CLEARING by the
dialog: creek. Eric follows. Cold enough to see your breath out here.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCK CREEK PARK - CLEARING - CONTINUING 208
dialog: Not a bad place to dump a body, (Chandra Levy will be found
text: here in less than a year.) Eric follows Hanssen, twigs and
text: snow crackling under their feet. Otherwise, there's SILENCE.
text: ++-until Hanssen stops, and pulls his .38 from a holster.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN (CONT'D)
dialog: They test you at 25 yards, 15 yards,
text: seven yards, and five yards,
text: With that, he aims at a branch and FIRES, a deafening sound.
text: (Eric is beside him.) The branch is decimated.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Prone, left hand, right hand, five-
dialog: yards-with-gun-in-holster. You get
text: three seconds to fire five shots.
text: He turns and FIRES AGAIN, blowing away another branch. But
text: this time the gun is just a foot from Eric's face. Eric drops
text: to his knees out of instinct.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: FBI's a gun-culture, I told you.
dialog: Can't advance here unless you can
dialog: shoot.
dialog: 116.
text: He extends a hand. Eric rises... Then BANG! Another blast,
text: mere INCHES from Eric's face this time. Eric spins away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What're you doing?!
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: Who was calling you before?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What?!
text: Hanssen steps toward him, then another SHOT, right beside
text: Eric's ear now. Eric spins away again, scared witless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: I need to know if I can trust you.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Put the gun down, Boss.
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: (another shot)
dialog: Who was on the phone?
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: PUT THE FUCKING GUN DOWN!!!
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: I NEED TO KNOW IF I CAN TRUST YOU!
text: Hanssen's fires again, but... CLICK. His .38 is empty.
text: There's a surprised silence for a moment.
text: Then Eric knocks the gun from his hand. It falls into snow.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Can I trust you? Jesus!
text: Hanssen doesn't answer... and Eric finally erupts:
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Ya know something, Boss? You do test
dialog: people too much, and I've had it! Who
dialog: the hell d'you think was calling me?
dialog: My handlers in the Kremlin? Once and
dialog: for all, for the record: I don't have
dialog: any. I'm not a foreign agent! Is that
dialog: official enough? ‘Cause I'm getting
dialog: really tired of having to prove
dialog: myself to you every five minutes. And
dialog: by the way, if I were SVR don't you
dialog: think I'd be working my way through
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 209
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Intel by now, instead of wasting my
dialog: time in some do-nothing I.T.
dialog: Division? Look around you, Boss: it's
dialog: just us out here. There's no one
dialog: tailing you, there isn't any GPS on
dialog: your car. You don't matter that much.
text: There it was - the perfect dodge, a lie that is 100% true.
dialog: And Hanssen doesn't know what to do with dbs 5
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: The call was from Juliana, obviously.
dialog: My wife. She's trying to reach me
dialog: because I told her I'd be home by now
dialog: and because we're in another fight,
dialog: caused by you as usual. Thanks for
text: dropping by unannounced and lecturing
dialog: her about Opus Dei, that was real
dialog: helpful. And thanks for staring at
text: her in church like she was from Mars.
dialog: That also worked out great. Lemme
dialog: guess, you were testing her too. Ya
dialog: know she asked me this morning why
dialog: you're like this, why you grind
dialog: everybody so hard. And I had all
dialog: these answers ready: "He's
dialog: misunderstood." "He's trying to fix
dialog: the Bureau and no one'll listen." "He
dialog: was born in the wrong century." "His
dialog: father was a prick." I've got a whole
dialog: list. But ya know something? At the
dialog: end of the day it's all crap. You are
dialog: who you are and you do what you do.
dialog: The why doesn't mean a fucking thing.
dialog: Does it?
text: Hanssen considers that, his face a blank...
text: +..then he turns without a word, and starts a slow, drunken
text: walk back toward the car. Conversation over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HANSSEN
dialog: I matter plenty.
text: He vanishes into a thicket of woods. We hear his shoulders
text: rubbing against the brush...
text: Eric doesn't move. He can't.

scene_heading: INT./EXT. HANSSEN'S CAR — PARKED - DAY (4 P.M.) 211
text: Hanssen, sitting in his Taurus, parked at a curb on Fairway
text: Drive in Vienna, Va. We DRIFT IN toward him, a slow zoom, as
text: he stares out the window, at the trees.
text: Hard to say exactly what he's thinking just now, but there's
text: a certain resignation on his face, a yielding to something
text: inevitable. We land on a CLOSE-UP. He sighs...
scene_heading: INT. WFO - CONF. ROOM - KATE'S CUBICLE - SAME 212
text: Kate sits, staring at a VIDEO MONITOR. On it, she's picking
text: up a LIVE FEED from inside a vehicle of some kind. Looks like

scene_heading: EXT. HANSSEN'S CAR - PARKED - RESUMING 213

scene_heading: EXT. FOXSTONE PARK - ENTRANCE - CONTINUING 214

scene_heading: EXT. FOXSTONE PARK - FOOTBRIDGE — MOMENTS LATER 216
text: Through bare trees we see the houses that overlook this park.

text: lawn & leaf bag there... and walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. FOXSTONE PARK -— TRAIL — CONTINUING 217
dialog: 
text: Hanssen walks on a thin trail, footbridge at his back. Sounds
