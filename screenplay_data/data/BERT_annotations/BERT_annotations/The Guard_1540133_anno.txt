speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: What the fuck is he doing here?
speaker_heading: MCBRIDE

speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Sure it’s all good clean fun,

text: He pats his camera and hustles out the door just as

speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: I’m worried about that lad, now.
dialog: He has an interest in the photographic

speaker_heading: (examining the DEAD MAN)
text: He looks like Brendan Foley.
text: MCBRIDE produces a pad and pen, noting the name.
speaker_heading: MCBRIDE

speaker_heading: MCBRIDE
dialog: Ah...Should you, ah...Should you be

speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: From the Bible, looks like. I knew

speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: He was a good-looking lad.
dialog: Lovely lips.

speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: The significance of the pot-plant

speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: I have the gift. Did nobody tell ya?
speaker_heading: MCBRIDE is confused.

speaker_heading: MCBRIDE

speaker_heading: BOYLE

speaker_heading: MCBRIDE
dialog: Maybe this is the killer's five and

speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: (feigning interest)
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: MCBRIDE
dialog: Maybe he’s killed four people before
dialog: now, and he’s maimed another lad.
dialog: Cut off his legs maybe. Which would
dialog: be the half. So this would be victim
dialog: number five and a half.
speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: Interesting theory. So what you're
dialog: saying is, we may very well have a
dialog: serial killer on our hands.
speaker_heading: MCBRIDE
dialog: It’s a distinct possibility.

speaker_heading: BOYLE

speaker_heading: OLEYUWO

speaker_heading: BOYLE

speaker_heading: GABRIELA
dialog: Why do they kill themselves?
speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: Ah sure, why does anybody kill
dialog: themselves? It's mostly young men.
dialog: The drink. Depression. Lack of sex.
dialog: That’s the main one, in my view.
dialog: I bet you now, if I opened a brothel

dialog: in half.
speaker_heading: GABRIELA
