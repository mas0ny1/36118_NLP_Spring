dialog: get."
text: Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's
dialog: shoes.
speaker_heading: FORREST

dialog: I wish I had shoes like that.
speaker_heading: BLACK WOMAN
dialog: My feet hurt.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Momma always says there's an awful
dialog: lot you could tell about a person by
dialog: their shoes. Where they're going.
dialog: Where they've been.
text: The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his
dialog: own shoes.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I

text: around the room awkwardly.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: How do those feel? His legs are
dialog: strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've
text: ever seen. But his back is as crooked

speaker_heading: FORREST (V.O.)
dialog: She said we was related to him in
dialog: some way. And, what he did was, he
dialog: started up this club called the Ku
text: Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in
text: their robes and their bedsheets and
dialog: act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks
dialog: or something. They'd even put
text: bedsheets on their horses and ride
dialog: around. And anyway, that's how I got
dialog: my name. Forrest Gump.
scene_heading: EXT. GREENBOW
text: Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street.
speaker_heading: FORREST (V.O.)

text: old men. Mrs. Gump holds tightly onto Forrest's hand.
speaker_heading: MRS. GUMP

dialog: God intended everybody to be the
dialog: same, he'd have given us all braces
dialog: on our legs.
speaker_heading: FORREST (V.O.)
dialog: Momma always had a way of explaining

dialog: attend public school, Mrs. Gump.
dialog: He's gonna have to go to a special
dialog: school. Now, he'll be just fine.
speaker_heading: MRS. GUMP
dialog: What does normal mean, anyway? He
dialog: might be a bit on the slow side, but
dialog: my boy Forrest is going to get the
dialog: same opportunities as everyone else.
dialog: He's not going to some special school
dialog: to learn to how to re-tread tires.
