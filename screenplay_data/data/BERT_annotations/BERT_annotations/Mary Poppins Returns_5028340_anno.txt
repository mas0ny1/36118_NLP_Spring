scene_heading: EXT. THE DOCKS NEAR THE EMBANKMENT —- CONTINUOUS
text: Dropping down from the rooftops of London, we discover

text: docks. Jack slaloms through it all as he continues on his
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: THOUGH THE LAMPS I'M TURNING DOWN
scene_heading: PLEASE DON'T FEEL BLUE
scene_heading: FOR IN THIS PART OF LONDON TOWN
text: THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH
text: Jack stops at a lamppost and dims the lamp. Ahead, NEEDY
text: LONDONERS stand on a soup kitchen queue that snakes around
text: the corner. VOLUNTEERS hand out food to them.
dialog: DON'T BELIEVE THE THINGS YOU'VE READ
dialog: YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S UP AHEAD
scene_heading: UNDERNEATH THE LOVELY LONDON SKY
text: Jack grabs an apple as he swerves past a fruit cart and

scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD PUB - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. CHERRY TREE LANE - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack whistles as he rides onto Cherry Tree Lane, a street
text: lined with 19th-Century homes.
text: He passes the neighboring MILKMAN, giving him a wave.
speaker_heading: MILKMAN
dialog: Mornin’, Jack!
text: Jack glances up to a rooftop that has been fitted to look
text: like the deck of a ship - at the moment, though, no one is at
text: the helm. He looks up, worried.
text: Finally, the rooftop door creaks open and ADMIRAL BOOM
text: appears, pushed in a wheelchair by his First Mate, BINNACLE.
speaker_heading: BINNACLE
dialog: (Blows whistle: )
dialog: Admiral... above decks!

scene_heading: SOME BRIGHT NEW SONG
text: He sets up his ladder at the lamppost that stands before 17
text: Cherry Tree Lane - a modest house which has fallen slightly
text: into disrepair.
text: A BOY AND GIRL appear at the window in the upper floor of the
text: Banks home, waving.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont'd)
dialog: Y’awright, children?
text: Jack waves to the children. They wave back and exit. Jack

scene_heading: LOVELY LONDON SKY...
text: Jack dims the light and glances up into the sky. He slides
text: down the ladder, climbs onto his bicycle and rides off.
text: BIG BEN TOLLS eight o’clock in the distance. A black car
text: pulls up as Jack rides off.
text: Two men in suits get out of the car: GOODING and FRYE. The
text: men set their watches by the toll of the bell, then walk up
text: the path to the house.
text: UP ABOVE, the Admiral and Binnacle have just made it across
text: the rooftop. The Admiral is outraged.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL BOOM
dialog: Great steaming clams - they’ve done
dialog: it again! Those blundering blowfish
dialog: have rung Big Ben too soon!
speaker_heading: BINNACLE
text: Storm clouds on the horizon, Sir.
text: Heading straight for Cherry Tree
dialog: Lane.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL BOOM
text: Batten down the hatches, Mr.
dialog: Binnacle. Rough seas ahead, I fear.
text: Both men react as a SCREAM comes from the Bank’s household.
speaker_heading: ELLEN (0.S.)
speaker_heading: AAAHHH! !!
scene_heading: INT. THE BANKS FRONT ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Inside the Banks family home, the house shows some signs of
dialog: wear and inattention.
speaker_heading: ELLEN (0.S.)
dialog: (The scream continues: )
speaker_heading: AAAHHH! !!
text: The door that leads into the kitchen flies open - water can
text: be seen spraying the room. ELLEN, the housekeeper, runs into
text: the hall in a panic and calls upstairs.
speaker_heading: ELLEN (cont'd)
dialog: MICHAEL! JANE!
text: JANE and MICHAEL BANKS rush in from the parlor behind Ellen.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What is it, Ellen?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: The bloomin’ sink’s exploded!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Not again!
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Oh dear.
text: Michael rushes into the kitchen. The boy and girl we saw
text: earlier, ANNABEL and JOHN, run down the steps.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE (cont'd)
dialog: Oh - Annabel, John - !
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: We heard, Aunt Jane - I'll ring the
dialog: plumbers!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’ll turn off the water at the mains!
text: John runs down into the cellar.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: (Going into the kitchen: )
dialog: Thank you, darlings - Ellen, fetch
dialog: us a mop and towels, will you?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (Grumbling to herself:)
dialog: I told ‘im to get them pipes fixed.
dialog: They been there since the Romans
dialog: ruled.
text: Ellen disappears into the cellar. GEORGIE comes down the
text: stairs, carrying his stuffed giraffe, “Gillie.”
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: What’s happening?
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Don’t go in the kitchen, Georgie -
dialog: not without your Wellies -—
dialog: (On phone: )
dialog: Yes, hello. We’ve had a burst pipe.
text: (There is a TAPPING at the
dialog: front door. On phone:)
dialog: Excuse me —
dialog: (Calling: )
dialog: Ellen, could you please get the
dialog: door? I’ve got the plumbers here.
text: Ellen comes out of the cellar with the mop and towels.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: That was quick work, wasn’t it?
text: Hands full, she gives the towels to Georgie.
speaker_heading: ELLEN (cont'd)
dialog: Here Georgie - take these.
dialog: (Heading to the door:)
dialog: Alright, alright - I’m coming.
text: Gooding and Frye stand outside, tacking up a notice.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Ah. Good morning, mum.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
text: They don’t look like plumbers.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (Looks over.)
dialog: I meant on the phone.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: We are not plumbers - we’re
dialog: lawyers.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Lawyers? Here’s me, hopin’ you'd
dialog: prove useful.
text: She absentmindedly hands the mop to Gooding and shuts the door.
dialog: Aunt Jane
dialog: her dress
dialog: She wraps
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Water’s off!
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (hanging up)
text: And the plumbers are on their way.
text: comes out of the kitchen, her hair and the front of
text: drenched with water.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Well done, everyone. Phew! Such
dialog: excitement!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: What are you doing here, Aunt Jane?
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
text: (She takes a towel from
dialog: Georgie to dry off:)
dialog: We’re handing out breakfasts at the
dialog: union hall. I snuck away for
dialog: morning hugs. Come here.
text: the towel around Georgie and gives the three
text: children a hug.
text: Aunt Jane takes the towels and heads back into the kitchen,
text: Georgie picks up a towel she has accidentally dropped,
text: following her into the kitchen.
text: There’s a knock at the door. Ellen goes over and opens it.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Will you stop that bangin’? It’s
dialog: barely eight o’clock on a Sunday
dialog: mornin’!
dialog: (more)
speaker_heading: ELLEN (cont'd)
text: (She sees her mop, grabs
dialog: it:)
dialog: Wot’cher doin’ with my mop?
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: Forgive the intrusion, mum. Our
dialog: current workload prevents us taking
dialog: weekends off.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: We would like to have a word with
dialog: Mr. Banks, if he is available.
text: Ellen finally sees the notice on the door.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: “Notice of... Repossession?”
text: Frye, by far the more sympathetic of the two, sighs loudly
text: and nods sadly, looking genuinely pained. Ellen glares.
speaker_heading: ELLEN (cont'd)
dialog: Wait there.
text: She goes back inside. John and Annabel quickly turn away,
text: pretending not to be paying attention. The lawyers peer
text: through the door as Michael re-enters from the kitchen,
text: thoroughly soaked, followed by Georgie. As Michael takes off
dialog: his jacket:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'll be cleaning up that mess all
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (Reaching for the jacket:)
dialog: Here. Let me take that, father.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, thank you, darling.
text: Annabel runs upstairs with the jacket.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (Undisguised contempt: )
dialog: “Scuse me, sir - the wolves are at
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What do they want?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: A good thrashin’, if you ask me.
dialog: (She looks into the
text: kitchen, sighs.)
dialog: Looks like the River Thames in
dialog: there.
text: Aunt Jane comes out as Michael takes the mop from Ellen.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Don’t worry - I’ll clean up, Ellen.
dialog: Why don’t you see to breakfast?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Suppose someone ‘as to - ‘less we
dialog: all want to starve.
text: She goes into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: (Aside, to Michael: )
dialog: Why don’t you let Ellen clean up?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (A resigned sigh:)
dialog: I'm afraid lately that means more
dialog: work for me. The other day I found
text: a butcher’s sack hanging on the
dialog: coat rack - and my hat was in the
dialog: larder.
text: Aunt Jane catches sight of her damp hair in the hall mirror.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: I need a brush - I look a fright.
dialog: (As she goes upstairs: )
dialog: Don’t forget you have guests at the
dialog: door, Michael.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Right -
text: (He goes to the door,
dialog: dodging the children)
dialog: I'm sorry. We're struggling through
dialog: a bit of chaos this morning -
text: They take a step into the hallway. Michael closes the door
text: behind them.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: So it seems. Unfortunately, Mr.
dialog: Banks, our business cannot wait.
text: Ellen reappears from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Excuse me, sir - how exactly am I
dialog: supposed to make breakfast when
dialog: there’s nothing in the larder but
dialog: pickled herring and marmalade?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (Hand to forehead: )
dialog: The groceries - I meant to go
dialog: yesterday.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
text: (She nods, turns to go.)
text: Very well, then. Pickled herring
dialog: for breakfast, marmalade for lunch.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (Once Ellen has gone:)
dialog: That little shop across the park
dialog: will be open. The three of us can
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, thank you, John.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (Aside, to Annabel: )
dialog: But you said we would go to the
dialog: park today!
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: We'll cut through the park on the
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: But -
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Enough, Georgie. Come along.
text: John takes the mop from Michael.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'll take that, Father.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Thank you.
text: Aunt Jane comes back downstairs as the twins lead Georgie
text: into the kitchen. Michael gestures for the lawyers to join
text: him in the parlor. Aunt Jane follows, putting on her coat.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (cont'd)
dialog: Please, come through -
scene_heading: INT. THE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Now, what is it I can do for you?
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: I am Hamilton Gooding; this is Mr.
dialog: Templeton Frye. We are solicitors
dialog: with the law firm of Gordy, Cordry,
dialog: Gooding and Frye.
text: Aunt Jane suppresses a laugh.
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: GOODING (cont'd)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Nothing.
text: Gooding notices the poster sticking out of Aunt Jane’s
dialog: notebook.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: SPRUCE? Is that your garden club?
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: No, it’s the “Society for the
dialog: Protection of the Rights of the
dialog: Underpaid Citizens of England.”
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: A labour organizer?
dialog: (Archly polite, to Frye:)
dialog: She's a labour organizer.
text: Gooding and Frye sit on the sofa. Michael sits in the
text: armchair opposite. Aunt Jane moves round, tying her belt.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Well, yes - we also run soup
dialog: kitchens - it’s a never-ending job
dialog: these days.
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: I’m sure it is, Mrs. Banks.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Miss Banks, actually. I’m Michael’s
dialog: sister.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: My wife passed away this last year.
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: That’s awful! Those poor children.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Our deepest condolences.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Thank you. Forgive me - what brings
dialog: the two of you here this morning?
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: I’m going to say my good-byes.
text: Aunt Jane kisses Michael on the cheek and heads out.
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Mr. Banks, you took out a loan with
dialog: Fidelity Fiduciary Bank last year
dialog: against the value of your home.
text: Aunt Jane stops and steps back to Michael.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: You did what? Michael!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I had to, Jane. I didn’t have much
dialog: choice, what with Kate and the
dialog: bills piling up -
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: Hard enough these days, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Yes, well, it seems you’ve fallen
dialog: three months behind in payments -
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I am sorry. Kate, my wife, used to
dialog: handle all our finances, you see,
dialog: and I’ve been a bit off my stride.
dialog: (Stands, walks to desk:)
dialog: How much is it I owe you exactly?
speaker_heading: GOODING
text: Unfortunately, the bank is now
dialog: demanding you pay back the entire
dialog: loan in full.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The entire loan?
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Yes - it’s all in the contract.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That’s more than I make in a year. I
dialog: couldn’t possibly.
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: Oh dear!
text: Gooding stands to leave, picking up his hat and briefcase.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: You have five days. If you are
dialog: unable to pay in full by Friday at
dialog: midnight, I’m afraid we will have
dialog: to repossess your home, and you
dialog: will have to vacate the premises.
text: Frye sighs, distraught. Gooding glances over, irritated.
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But I work at Fidelity Fiduciary!
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Not as an accountant, I presume.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, as a teller - I took a part-
dialog: time position there this past year.
dialog: You see, I’m really an artist -
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Be that as it may -
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But my father, George Banks, was a
dialog: senior partner there!
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: (A realization: )
dialog: Father left us bank shares! You
dialog: could use them to pay off the loan.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I was saving those for the
dialog: children, but -
text: Frye stands.
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: Shares? In the bank?
dialog: (Brightly, to Gooding: )
dialog: That does change things, doesn’t it?
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Do you have the share certificate?
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Sorry? The what?
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: The document —
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: The document proving you own shares
text: in the bank.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ... I suppose it must be somewhere
text: among father’s old papers.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ADMIRAL’S ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
text: On the rooftop next door, the Admiral and Binnacle are
text: finally prepared to fire off the 8 a.m. cannon.
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL BOOM
dialog: Primed and ready, Mr. Binnacle?
speaker_heading: BINNACLE
dialog: Ready and charged, sir.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL BOOM
dialog: On my mark. Three, two, one - FIRE!
speaker_heading: BOOM!
scene_heading: INT. THE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Inside, the cannon fire rattles the walls, knocking
text: everything askew and terrifying the lawyers. A clock and an
text: urn land in Gooding’s hands. Ash flies out of the fireplace.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Good heavens! Are you housing
dialog: anarchists?
dialog: Michael and Aunt Jane behave as though this is perfectly
text: normal; they begin pushing all the furniture and belongings
text: back into place as they speak.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: No, that’s the Admiral. He fires
text: off a cannon to mark the hour.
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: (He checks his watch:)
text: But he’s over five minutes late.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes, I’m afraid he’s been running a
dialog: little behind these last few years.
text: Michael and Aunt Jane push the piano back in place.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: As are we, this morning. You’ve
dialog: been given notice;
dialog: (Hands Michael the notice)
dialog: We'll see ourselves out. Come along,
dialog: Mr. Frye.
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: (putting on his hat)
dialog: I hope you find that share
dialog: certificate. I really do.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Good day to you both.
dialog: (As they leave, to Frye:)
dialog: You really have chosen the wrong
dialog: profession, you know...
text: The door shuts.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Why didn’t you tell me you had
dialog: taken out a loan, Michael?
text: Michael moves away from Jane.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I didn’t want to worry you - or the
dialog: children. I kept thinking I would
dialog: catch up. Kate always managed.
dialog: (He shakes his head:)
dialog: Of all the thick-headed mistakes...
dialog: I can’t lose our home, Jane. She’s
dialog: everywhere here.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Well then we aren’t going to let
dialog: that happen. But, Michael, you know
dialog: we neither of us have enough money
dialog: between us - so we just have to
dialog: find that share certificate. Do you
dialog: have any idea where father might
dialog: have kept it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Up in the attic, I suppose...
text: (He tucks away his
dialog: emotions, smiles.)
dialog: «+. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to
dialog: bring you into all this.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: (Exasperated: )
dialog: Michael! This is our family home,
dialog: and you're about to lose it - so
dialog: stop pretending everything’s fine.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE (0.S.)
dialog: Are we going to lose our home?
dialog: 14
text: Michael and Aunt Jane turn. Georgie and the twins, having
text: entered from the dining room in their coats and wellies, have
dialog: been listening to them.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, no - no, of course not,
dialog: Georgie.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: I was saying you won’t have to
dialog: worry, because your father owns
dialog: shares in the bank.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: But you said we don’t have enough
dialog: money.
text: Michael grabs paper and pen and sketches something.
dialog: 15
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, I can make more - I ama
dialog: banker now, aren’t I? That’s what
dialog: bankers do - make money.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: But you’re not a banker - you’re a
dialog: painter.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes, well - painters don’t make
dialog: money. Not these days. Here, you
dialog: see? The day has hardly begun and
dialog: I’ve already made you 10 pounds.
dialog: 
text: Michael hands Georgie what he’s drawn - a decent likeness of
text: a 10-pound note. Annabel and John exchange a glance, seeing
text: through Michael's false cheer instantly. Georgie smiles.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (Looking at his watch:)
dialog: We'd best be going.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Let’s get your hats on then.
text: Annabel goes to the front hall coat rack to get their hats.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: (With a wink, handing a
dialog: few coins to John:)
dialog: John, one moment. Georgie shouldn't
dialog: have to spend his 10 pounds on the
dialog: shopping - here you are.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Thank you, father.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (Entering: )
dialog: Off to the park now, I see.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Yes - that’s right, Ellen.
text: Ellen helps the children with their hats. Aunt Jane takes off
text: her coat as she heads for the stairs.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: (To Michael: )
dialog: Shall we search the attic, then?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Don’t you have to go to work?
dialog: 16
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: (Rolling up her sleeves: )
dialog: Work can wait.
text: Michael follows her up the stairs.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Thank you, Jane - yes, I’1l1 look in
dialog: the attic. Why don’t you check
dialog: father’s old wardrobe?
text: Ellen follows the children to the front door.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We’ll make lunch when we get home,
dialog: Ellen.
text: Annabel takes Gillie from Georgie, handing it to Ellen.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Gillie stays here.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (As the children leave: )
dialog: Blimey - such little grown-ups
dialog: you've become.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PARK - DAY
text: Annabel reads over the shopping list as the children walk
dialog: through the park.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Father didn’t give us enough, did he?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Not nearly.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: We can ask for day-old bread at half
dialog: off; that’s what mother used to do.
text: Georgie smiles, seeing MISS LARK, the children’s wealthy
text: neighbor, walking her dog WILLOUGHBY.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Hello, Willoughby! Hello, Miss Lark!
speaker_heading: MISS LARK
dialog: Hello, Georgie! Twins.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Come on Georgie, we haven't got
dialog: time for this.
dialog: 17
text: Willoughby barks. Georgie notices a woman selling balloons
text: (BALLOON LADY) in the distance. He cuts across the grass
dialog: toward her:
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: The balloon lady! Can we get
dialog: balloons?
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: No, Georgie - we haven’t enough for
dialog: groceries as it is.
text: The Park Keeper appears, calling to Georgie.
speaker_heading: PARK KEEPER
dialog: Oi, Georgie Banks - keep off the
dialog: grass! I don’t spend all day caring
dialog: for it just to see my work get
dialog: trampled on! Go on, hop it!
text: Georgie sighs and reluctantly returns to the path.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Sorry.

dialog: What if Father does lose the house?
speaker_heading: ANNABEL

dialog: would do.
scene_heading: INT. THE ATTIC - DAY
text: The attic is a complete mess. Michael’s easels, canvases and
text: art supplies are all piled up in a corner. Michael goes over
text: to an old desk. He searches through its drawers, then picks
text: up a wooden storage crate.
text: Inside the crate, Michael finds a jewelry box with an
text: engraved “K” on its lid. When he opens it, a gentle melody
text: plays. He takes out a necklace of his wife’s, gazing at it a
text: moment. He sets the box aside and continues searching the
text: attic, still holding the necklace - but he can’t get the
text: gentle melody out of his head...

scene_heading: FOR EVERYTHING'S IN DISARRAY

scene_heading: WHEN GEORGIE NEEDED EXPLANATIONS
dialog: YOU ALWAYS KNEW JUST WHAT TO SAY
scene_heading: AND I MISS OUR FAMILY CONVERSATIONS
dialog: IT'S SILENT SINCE YOU WENT AWAY
text: Michael looks out of the window.
speaker_heading: WINTER HAS GONE
dialog: BUT NOT FROM THIS ROOM
dialog: SNOW'S LEFT THE LANE
text: BUT THE CHERRY TREES FORGOT TO BLOOM
text: He reminds himself to keep searching.
dialog: The certificate... The
dialog: certificate...
dialog: I'LL CARRY ON THE WAY YOU TOLD ME
dialog: I SAY THAT LIKE I HAVE A CHOICE
dialog: AND THOUGH YOU ARE NOT HERE TO HOLD ME
dialog: IN THE ECHOES I CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE
text: BUT STILL ONE QUESTION FILLS MY DAY DEAR
text: THE ANSWER I'VE MOST LONGED TO KNOW
dialog: EACH MOMENT SINCE YOU WENT AWAY DEAR
dialog: MY QUESTION, KATE, IS "WHERE'D YOU GO?"
text: As Aunt Jane enters, Michael puts away the necklace and
text: closes the lid of the jewelry box, turning away to hide his
dialog: emotions.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
text: Nothing in the wardrobe.
dialog: (Gazing around the attic:)
dialog: Oh my goodness.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: (He turns back, smiling: )
dialog: Yes, it’s quite a mess, isn’t it?
text: Aunt Jane notices Michael's art supplies.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: What are all your art things doing
dialog: up here?
dialog: 19
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I wasn’t using them anymore. I
dialog: should probably get rid of it all.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Have you looked in father’s old
dialog: desk?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (pulling out an old
dialog: snowglobe)
dialog: I honestly don’t know why we kept
dialog: most of this stuff to begin with.
text: He reaches into a nearby box and pulls out an old, patched-up
text: kite with a suffragette banner for a tail.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (cont'd)
dialog: I mean, why on Earth did we save
dialog: this old broken thing?
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Don’t you remember that kite? We
dialog: used to love flying that with
dialog: mother and father.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, it won't fly anymore. Out it
dialog: goes - no looking back.
text: Michael throws the beaten kite into the rubbish box and
text: carries it to the door.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOUSE AT 17 CHERRY TREE LANE - DAY
text: Michael carries the trash bin out to leave by the side of the
text: house, then goes back inside. A beat, and then the wind
text: stirs. The kite shudders and lifts into the air, blown out of
text: the trash bin.
text: It skitters across the lane, past Jack, who is riding his
text: bicycle. He stops in his tracks, watching the kite skip by.
dialog: The behavior of this kite strikes him as unusual, to say the
text: least. He glances up, sensing something in the air.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (Singing softly:)
text: HOLD ON TIGHT TO THOSE YOU LOVE
text: AND MAYBE SOON FROM UP ABOVE...
text: He pedals off in pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PARK —- CONTINUOUS
text: In the park, Willoughby the dog sees the kite tumble past and
text: barks madly.
dialog: 20
text: The kite swings up to hit a MAN ON A PARK BENCH in the back
text: of the head, knocking off his bowler hat. Barely reacting,
text: the man calmly sets his hat back in place and continues
text: reading a newspaper.
text: Up ahead, the twins are poring over their errand list;
text: Georgie, lagging behind, sees the kite tumble past - he
text: chases after it.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: How long do you think it will take
dialog: us today?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, let’s see. It’s a nine minute
dialog: walk to the shop. If it takes about
dialog: ten minutes to purchase each item,
dialog: we should be back home by-
text: Jack races past John and Annabel on his bicycle.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ‘Scuse me, children - coming
dialog: through!
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Georgie! Come back!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Georgie!
text: The twins start after Georgie, but the Park Keeper sees them.
speaker_heading: PARK KEEPER
dialog: You two - off the grass!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But our brother -
speaker_heading: PARK KEEPER
dialog: You heard me - now!
text: A gust of wind sends the kite over a hedge. Georgie scrambles
text: through the hedge into a CLEARING, getting his clothes
text: covered in mud. The kite is there, leaning against a stone
text: bridge as though waiting for him. Georgie runs to it, pulls
text: out the spool of string that’s been tucked in its frame and
text: raises the kite into the air. Clouds gather and roil. The
text: wind grows violent, dragging Georgie off his feet as the kite
text: shoots up through the clouds.
text: John and Annabel are rushing along the path when they hear:
speaker_heading: GEORGIE (0.S.)
dialog: Help!
text: The twins charge out across the grass and dive under the
dialog: hedge.
dialog: 21
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: WE’RE COMING GEORGIE!
text: Jack, meanwhile, stops his bike on the nearby path and
text: hurries over to rescue Georgie.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hold on...!
text: Jack grabs hold of Georgie, pulls him down. They both pull on
text: the kite string with all their might. The sky begins to calm,
text: the clouds part, and a figure, holding onto the kite’s tail,
text: comes into view...
dialog: It is MARY POPPINS!
text: Dressed in a long coat, scarf, and eccentric hat, Mary
text: Poppins carries a carpetbag in her free hand and has a parrot-—
text: headed umbrella tucked under her arm.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont'd)
dialog: As I live and breathe...
text: The twins scramble through the bushes just in time to see
text: Mary Poppins glide the last five or so feet to the ground.
text: The moment Mary Poppins lands, she addresses Georgie. Jack
text: reels in the kite string. Brusquely:
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: You need to be more careful when
dialog: the wind rises, Georgie - you
dialog: nearly lost your kite.
dialog: (As the twins approach: )
dialog: And you two nearly lost your
dialog: Georgie. He might have got away
dialog: completely had I’d not been holding
text: on to the other end of that string.
text: She brushes herself off, taking note of the children’s
dialog: appearances.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: My goodness, Annabel - what have
dialog: you done to your clothes? You could
dialog: grow a garden in that much soil.
dialog: And John, you're just as filthy.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: How do you know our names?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (Beaming: )
dialog: Because she’s Mary Poppins, of
dialog: course! And may I say you look
dialog: lovely, as always.
dialog: 22
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: You really think so?
dialog: It is nice to see you, Jack -
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good to see you too, Mary Poppins.
dialog: (To the children: )
dialog: I was just your age when we first
text: met, working for a chimney sweep.
text: Jack hands the kite back to Georgie.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: How is dear old Bert?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Traveling the world he is, off to
dialog: points unknown.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Well, now I am off to speak with the
dialog: father of these children - this
dialog: family is clearly in desperate need
dialog: of a nanny.
dialog: (To the children: )
dialog: Now, quick march and best foot forward,
dialog: and I’ll thank you not to dawdle.
text: Mary Poppins marches off, Georgie at her side. The twins
text: exchange a puzzled glance.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Go on.
text: The twins then hurry after their brother. Jack follows behind
text: and picks up his bike off the ground.
scene_heading: INT. THE STAIRCASE/FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Georgie charges into the hall, and shouts up the stairs.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Father! Aunt Jane - come quick!
text: Michael rushes to the top of the steps. Georgie stands at the
text: base of the stairs holding the weatherbeaten kite, excited.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What is it, Georgie?
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Has something happened?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I was flying a kite and it got
dialog: caught on a nanny!
dialog: 23
text: Michael and Aunt Jane come downstairs.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Whatever are you talking about?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Come look!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wait - where did you get that kite?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I found it in the park.
dialog: (Pointing to the door:)
dialog: She kept it from blowing away.
text: They look toward the front door as Mary Poppins steps into
text: the house for the first time in decades. Michael is so taken
text: aback that he drops the papers he holds.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Mary... ?
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: -+. Poppins?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Close your mouth please, Michael.
dialog: We are still not a codfish.
text: Aunt Jane giggles. Mary Poppins gives her a sidelong glance.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Jane Banks - still rather inclined
dialog: to giggle I see.
text: This stops Aunt Jane. Michael beams. Annabel and John run in,
text: closing the door behind them.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: -+. Good heavens, it really is you!
dialog: You seem hardly to have aged at
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Really! How rude. One never
dialog: discusses a woman’s age, Michael. I
dialog: would have hoped I had taught you
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean -
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: You came back! I thought we’d never
dialog: see you again.
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It is wonderful to see you -
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (Admiring herself in the
dialog: mirror: )
dialog: Yes, it is, isn’t it.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: You know her then?
text: As Mary Poppins crosses away from the mirror, her reflection
text: remains behind, watching her go.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes. Mary Poppins used to be our
dialog: nanny.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: What brings you here after all this
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: The same thing that brought me the
dialog: first time: I’ve come to look after
dialog: the Banks children.
text: The twins exchange a look.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Us?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (Turning: )
dialog: .«.. Oh, yes - you too.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (A little huffy: )
dialog: But we don’t need a nanny. Mother
dialog: taught us to look after ourselves.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: You did just misplace Georgie, I
dialog: might point out.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Only slightly. We got him back.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: We can do anything a nanny can.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
text: Mary Poppins flew here on a kite.
dialog: You can’t do that, can you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What are you talking about,
dialog: Georgie? Don’t be silly.
dialog: 25
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Oh, let him believe what he likes.
dialog: (To Georgie: )
dialog: When your father and I were young, we
dialog: used to imagine Mary Poppins could do
dialog: all sorts of impossible things.
text: Georgie alone notices the parrot on the handle of Mary
text: Poppins’ umbrella coming to life.
speaker_heading: PARROT UMBRELLA
dialog: (Squawking: )
dialog: Actually -
text: Mary Poppins calmly pinches the parrot’s beak shut.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ‘Actually,’ what?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Actually, I’d like to get back to
dialog: the matter of my employment.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Your umbrella talks!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Georgie, please - we're in the
text: midst of a grown-up conversation.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Why don’t we go upstairs, Georgie?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: But it did talk! I promise -
text: The twins lead Georgie upstairs. Once they’ve gone:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm afraid sometimes Georgie suffers
text: from an excess of imagination.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: As I recall, you had the same
dialog: affliction yourself when you were
dialog: young.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Did I, really? Well, those days are
dialog: long behind me.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Are they, indeed?
dialog: (She nods, confirming
dialog: something to herself.)
dialog: About my employment, then -
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes, about that - the truth is, I
dialog: simply can’t afford -
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: We can settle on terms later,
dialog: although I will want my old room
dialog: back, as long as it’s not a
dialog: complete disaster, and I insist on
dialog: having every second Tuesday off.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But I’m afraid -
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Of course, Mary Poppins.
text: Michael shoots Aunt Jane a look.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Good, good. That’s all settled.
dialog: Then I’1l stay. Now, if you'll
dialog: excuse me, the children have turned
dialog: themselves into dustbins; my first
dialog: order of business is to see them
text: properly bathed and dressed.
text: Michael pulls Aunt Jane into the living room.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Have you gone completely mad, Jane?
dialog: I can’t afford to take on anyone
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Mary Poppins isn’t just anyone.
dialog: Don’t you see, Michael? No one’s
dialog: hiring nannies anymore. The poor
dialog: woman has no place to go.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Neither will we by the end of the
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Oh, don’t be so grumpy. You sound
dialog: just like father.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I do not!
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Give Mary Poppins a chance. You need
text: help just as much as she does.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh... very well. She can stay for
dialog: the time being, I suppose.
dialog: (more)
dialog: 27
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (cont'd)
dialog: (Ironically: )
dialog: After all, she did fly all this way
text: on a kite.
text: They share a laugh. Aunt Jane smiles, hesitates.
text: Behind them, Mary Poppins hops on the bannister and glides up
text: the stairs, leaving her bag and umbrella behind.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Those things, when we were young -
dialog: they didn’t really...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (With a smile:)
dialog: Happen? No...
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: No, of course not.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Ridiculous.
text: They laugh.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Mary Poppins glides up the bannister past Ellen, carrying an
text: armful of fresh towels.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Oh hello, Mary Poppins.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Hello, Ellen.
text: Mary Poppins hops off the bannister. Georgie is waiting for
text: her. His jaw drops as the parrot umbrella and her carpetbag
text: float down from above and into her hands.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: How did you do that?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: And why didn’t father believe you
dialog: flew here on a kite?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Because it’s complete nonsense, of
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: PARROT UMBRELLA
dialog: (Squawking: )
dialog: Grown-ups forget. They always do.
dialog: 28
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (A sharp look: )
dialog: That will be quite enough of that.
dialog: I should have left you in the
dialog: umbrella stand.
speaker_heading: PARROT UMBRELLA
dialog: (Aghast: )
dialog: Not with the canes!
text: Mary Poppins marches into the nursery, Georgie behind her.
scene_heading: INT. THE NURSERY - CONTINUOUS
text: John and Annabel are huddled together, talking in hushed
text: tones, when Mary Poppins arrives.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: What are you two whispering about?
speaker_heading: JOHN AND ANNABEL
dialog: (Coming to attention: )
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (removing her hat)
dialog: “Nothing” is such a useful word, isn’t
dialog: it? It can mean anything and
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: It’s just that -
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: - you don’t require the services of
text: a nanny.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, we have grown up a good deal
dialog: in the past year, after all.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Yes, yes. We’ll have to see what
dialog: can be done about that.
text: Mary Poppins straightens the items on the fireplace. She
text: reaches to adjust a china bowl on the mantelpiece.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: That was our mother’s - be careful.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (Haughtily: )
dialog: I am always careful.
text: Mary Poppins unties her jacket belt.
dialog: 29
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (Anxious: )
dialog: So... you’re staying?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (removing her jacket belt)
dialog: Yes, I’1l stay... until the door
text: opens.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (Looking to the nursery
dialog: door.)
dialog: That door is always opening.
text: Mary Poppins unbuttons and removes her coat.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Not that door - another one.
text: Mary Poppins opens the cupboard doors and takes out some
dialog: clothes.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (Incredulous: )
dialog: The bathroom door?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That’s just silly, Georgie.
dialog: (To Mary Poppins,
dialog: uncertain: )
dialog: Not the bathroom door?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (As she heads off:)
dialog: No. But a bath would prove useful.
dialog: Come along - time for a good, clean
dialog: start.
scene_heading: INT. THE BATHROOM - DAY
text: Steam clouds fill the air. Georgie and the twins stand in
text: their 1930's-style long underwear, watching as Mary Poppins
text: draws a bath. The twins aren’t in the least happy about it.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Our mother always had us take our
text: baths in the evening.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: In my experience, the perfect time
dialog: of day to have a bath is when one
dialog: needs a wash. Georgie will go
dialog: first.
dialog: 30
text: Mary Poppins gathers towels and washcloths, shampoo and a
text: fresh bar of soap, which she places beside the tub.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We are perfectly capable of drawing
dialog: our own baths.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: How very helpful John. In that
dialog: case, you may turn off the tap.
dialog: (He reaches to do so.)
dialog: But not quite yet - we still have
dialog: to put in the bubbles.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But I don’t like soap bubbles.
text: Mary Poppins goes off to retrieve her bag.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (0.S.)
dialog: Then you shall have to try to avoid
dialog: them at all costs.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (Quietly, to Annabel:
dialog: She's a tough nut, isn’t she?
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (Aloud: )
dialog: Alright then, but we’ll have to get
dialog: this done quickly.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Right, we still have to get to the
text: grocers - and it looks as though it
dialog: might rain.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I know who you should ask.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Her umbrella can’t talk, Georgie.
text: Mary Poppins returns with her carpetbag, shaking her head.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: The very idea.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: How do you know it can’t?
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Because it can’t. The very notion
dialog: is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Exactly right, Annabel. It’s
dialog: nonsense. Foolishness.
dialog: 31
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It makes no sense. And if it makes
dialog: no sense it can’t be true.

speaker_heading: I SUSPECT
scene_heading: (AND I’M NEVER INCORRECT)

text: As she pours the soap bubbles into the bath, a dolphin peaks
text: it's head up out of the water, much to the children’s
dialog: amazement. To the dolphin:
dialog: Not yet.
text: Mary Poppins gently pushes the dolphin back underwater.
text: SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SPLASH AND PLAY
dialog: CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?!

speaker_heading: TOO MUCH GLEE

scene_heading: TAKE THAT JOY

text: AND GIGGLE THROUGH THE DAY
text: THEY THINK THE WORLD’S A BRAND NEW SHINY TOY

speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
text: AND IF WHILE DREAMING IN THE CLOUDS
dialog: THEY FALL AND GO KERSPLAT
text: Mary Poppins searches in her bag for something, snapping her

text: over and pulls a large beach umbrella out of the sink with a
text: flourish, then slides it into the tub as well.
text: ALTHOUGH THEY’RE DOWN AND BENT IN HALF
text: THEY BRUSH RIGHT OFF AND START TO LAUGH!
dialog: CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?!
dialog: On second thoughts, perhaps you’re
dialog: right. It makes no sense to have a
dialog: bath this early -
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I want to take a bath!
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (Mildly surprised: )
dialog: Oh, really? Very well, then... Up
dialog: you go... and in you go!
text: She sets Georgie on the edge of the tub. He throws up his

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Georgie!
text: John lunges forward, grabbing Georgie’s hand at the last

speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: John!

text: Georgie and John are nowhere to be seen.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL (cont'd)
dialog: What happened? Will they be
dialog: alright?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: It is just a bath, after all. But
dialog: then again, it’s not my tub.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Shouldn’t you go after them?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: I had my bath this morning, thank

scene_heading: EXT. BENEATH THE MAGICAL OCEAN - CONTINUOUS
text: Georgie, the twins and Mary Poppins plummet past, all of them

speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: I remember that jar - with those

speaker_heading: MISS FARTHING
dialog: Of course, sir.
speaker_heading: WILKINS

speaker_heading: WILKINS

scene_heading: INT. WILKINS’ OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: If I had known George Banks’ son had

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Our father did leave us shares in

text: This is news to Wilkins. He looks up, smiling with interest.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Oh, well, that is good news.
dialog: 40
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Yes, it is, but the trouble is, we
dialog: can’t seem to find the share
dialog: certificate.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You wouldn’t happen to have any
dialog: record of our father’s shares, would
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: I would think so.
dialog: (Tapping his intercom: )
dialog: Would you bring in the
dialog: shareholder’s ledger, Miss
dialog: Farthing?
speaker_heading: MISS FARTHING (INTERCOM)
dialog: Right away, Mr. Wilkins.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: What about your uncle, Mr. Dawes,
dialog: Jr.? He would know if our father
dialog: received shares, wouldn’t he?
text: Wilkins sighs, gesturing to a portrait of his uncle.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: I'm afraid dear old Uncle Dawes is
dialog: getting on in years.
text: (He taps his temple.)
dialog: “Non compos mentis"” - which, sadly,
dialog: is why I had to take over for him.
dialog: Ah - thank you, Miss Farthing.
text: Miss Farthing has entered. She hands Wilkins the ledger and
text: leaves. Wilkins flips pages, runs a finger along the columns.
dialog: Aunt Jane
speaker_heading: WILKINS (cont'd)
dialog: Let’s see. Babcock, Baker. hmm.
dialog: There’s no listing of George Banks
dialog: here. But don’t despair.
dialog: (Pointing out the window
dialog: to Big Ben:)
dialog: You still have until that big fellow

dialog: keep searching here as well.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Thank you so much, Mr. Wilkins.
text: They shake hands. As Michael and Aunt Jane head to the door:
dialog: 4l
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Yes, thank you. It was such a
dialog: pleasure to meet you.
text: Michael and Aunt Jane leave. Wilkins absently takes out his
text: pocket watch, swinging it. He hits his intercom button.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Bring me all of George Banks’ old
dialog: files, would you?
speaker_heading: MISS FARTHING (INTERCOM)
dialog: Of course, Mr. Wilkins.
text: Wilkins walks round to his chair, swinging his pocket-watch,
text: and reopens the ledger. He turns to a page with the name
text: GEORGE BANKS written in bold letters. He tears the page out
text: and tosses it into the flames.
scene_heading: INT. THE NURSERY - EVENING
text: The children are already in bedclothes and robes when Mary

text: clothing. She sees Georgie jumping on the bed.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Georgie! This is a nursery, let me
dialog: remind you, not a music hall.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Can we have another bath?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Oh, pish posh.
dialog: (Turning: )
dialog: John, you'd best go downstairs and -
text: CRASH! From downstairs comes the sound of breaking glass.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: - help Ellen put away the dishes.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yes, Mary Poppins.
text: He goes. Mary Poppins heads for the wardrobe. Annabel
text: intercepts her, reaching for the clothes.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Here - I can put those away myself.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Very well.
text: Mary Poppins glances to the broken kite which leans against
dialog: Georgie’s bed. Sternly:
dialog: 42
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Georgie Banks - if you’re hoping
dialog: I‘1l let you take this sadly-
dialog: neglected kite to the park
dialog: tomorrow, you had better start
dialog: patching it up this instant.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (Smiling: )
dialog: Yes, Mary Poppins.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING
text: Ellen is on a chair, doing her best to put dishes on a high
text: shelf in the china cabinet. John enters just as Ellen is
text: about to drop them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Here - let me help you with those.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Oh - there’s a good lad. Such a
dialog: help you are.
dialog: (She kicks the broken
dialog: plates away:)
dialog: I only wish I could do somethin’ to
dialog: ‘elp your father save this old
dialog: house.
dialog: (A beat. She considers.)
dialog: I could sell my broach and
dialog: necklace, I suppose - matching set,
dialog: my old mum gave ‘em to me.
text: Ellen picks up a large platter and holds it out to John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You'd do that for us?
text: Ellen pulls the platter away and holds it to her chest.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What?? Sell my prized possessions?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh no, I didn’t mean it like that.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Oh, don’t worry.
dialog: (She hands him the
dialog: platter. Confidentially: )
dialog: I think they’re fakes, anyway.
dialog: (hands over serving bowl)
dialog: There’s plenty in this house worth
dialog: more than them old trinkets.
text: John stares at the china soup tureen he’s holding. He quickly
text: passes it back to Ellen and rushes out of the room.
dialog: 43
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: If you'll excuse me, Ellen -
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What’s got into ‘im?
scene_heading: INT. THE NURSERY - EVENING
text: Georgie sits on his bed, Gillie at his side. He uses scissors
text: to cut up his father’s drawing of the family and patches his
text: kite with the pieces. Annabel is putting toys back in the toy
text: chest when John comes rushing back in.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (With quiet urgency: )
dialog: Annabel - I know how to save the house!
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: What do you mean?
text: Mary Poppins enters from her room, crossing to shut the
text: drapes.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: If you two are going to keep up all
dialog: this whispering, I would like you
dialog: to practice doing so as loudly as
dialog: possible. It will still be bad
dialog: manners, but at least then we’ll
dialog: all be in on the secret.
text: Mary Poppins notices Jack polishing one of the brass lamps on
text: the front portico of the house. She opens the window.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Hello, Jack!
text: Jack smiles. He swings himself up onto the portico, climbs
text: along the ledge to the nursery window and onto the balcony.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Mary Poppins! How are you this fine
dialog: evening?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Settling in quite nicely, thank you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (Climbing up:)
dialog: Y’know, when I was a lad, I used to
text: wave up to the boy and girl who
dialog: lived here.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: You mean Michael and Jane.
speaker_heading: 44
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Miss Jane Banks, that’s right. I
dialog: see Mr. Banks about now and again -—
dialog: it’s been ages since I’ve seen her.
text: Now that Mary Poppins’ back is turned, John taps Annabel on
text: the shoulder and hurries over to the mantelpiece. They talk
dialog: in whispers.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
text: She lives in a flat on the other
dialog: side of town now. I’m sure you’ll
dialog: bump into her one of these days.
text: Across the room: John takes the china bowl off the
text: mantelpiece. It has an illustration of an autumn scene in a
text: park, with leaves falling from the trees. A carriage drives
text: along a winding path. A CLYDESDALE HORSE in mid-gallop is
text: hitched to the carriage. We see the COACHMAN from the back;
text: he wears a top hat and high collar, and holds a whip in his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (Whispering: )
dialog: What are you doing? We’re not
dialog: supposed to touch that.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (Looking closely at the
dialog: bowl: )
dialog: This is authentic Royal Doulton
dialog: china, Annabel. Mother always said
dialog: it was priceless, and I bet it’ll
dialog: be enough to pay off father’s debt.
text: Annabel grabs the bowl off John. He grabs it back from her.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: That’s a terrible idea, John.
dialog: Mother loved that bowl.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But she’d sell it herself to save
dialog: the house.
text: Georgie sees John holding the bowl and hurries over.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: That was mother’s - put that back!
dialog: (Grabbing for the bowl:)
dialog: Put it back!
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Here - give it to me.
text: Jack now sits on the windowsill, chatting with Mary Poppins.
text: He lowers his voice, leaning in:
dialog: 45
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It’s a good thing you come along
dialog: when you did, Mary Poppins.
text: As they tussle, the bowl slips and hits the floor, cracking
text: it and breaking a wedge-shaped piece from the rim.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont'd)
dialog: (Wincing: )
dialog: That didn’t sound good, now did it?
text: John picks up the bowl. Mary Poppins doesn’t turn.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: What are the three of you up to?
text: The children look at one another in a panic. John looks at
text: the bowl, and sees a piece missing.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (An urgent whisper: )
dialog: Give me the missing piece!
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: I haven't got it!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well look for it then!
text: John places the bowl back on the mantelpiece.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Which of you broke the bowl?
text: The three turn back around. Mary Poppins stands before them,
text: Jack behind her. She holds the missing piece in her hand.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Georgie did.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I did not! It was Annabel.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: If John hadn't taken it off the
dialog: mantel!
text: The children all starting arguing at the same time.
text: A voice comes from the bowl behind them.
speaker_heading: 1ST VOICE (HORSE - 0O.S.)
dialog: (Working-class accent: )
dialog: Actually, it was all three of them.
text: The children turn, bewildered, glancing over to the door and
text: the window, wondering where the voices came from.
dialog: 46
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Who said that?
text: Mary Poppins walks up and peers at the bowl.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Oh, dear.
text: They all peer at the bowl. THE ILLUSTRATION HAS CHANGED - the
text: crack has caused one of the carriage wheels to fall off, and
text: the carriage has tipped onto its axle. The Horse now stares
text: directly out of the bowl at the children, while the Coachman
text: peers down at the broken wheel.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Look - the picture’s changed.
text: We see Mary Poppins and the group peering into the bowl from
text: the horses’ “fish-eye lens” point of view.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
text: It looks as though they’ve broken
dialog: your carriage wheel.
speaker_heading: 2ND VOICE (COACHMAN - O.S.)
dialog: (Irish accent: )
dialog: That they have. It’s useless now.
speaker_heading: HORSE (0.S.)
text: Useless as a chocolate teapot.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The bowl is speaking!
speaker_heading: COACHMAN (0.S.)
dialog: And who do we think is going to fix
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ay, there’s the riddle. Them what
dialog: broke it fixes it. That’s what I
dialog: say. What do you think, Mary
dialog: Poppins?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (Irritated: )
dialog: I suppose we have no choice.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (Wide-eyed: )
dialog: But how are we going to do that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I know a bit about fixing carriages.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: We can’t fix their carriage wheel.
dialog: It isn’t possible!
dialog: 47
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Everything is possible - even the
dialog: impossible.
text: Mary Poppins takes the bowl, sets it on a small table in the
text: center of the nursery and presses the missing piece back in
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Now, gather ‘round everyone - spit,
dialog: spot!
dialog: They do so.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Georgie, don’t forget Gillie! Are
dialog: we ready?!
text: The children watch in astonishment as Mary Poppins SPINS THE
text: BOWL on the table. Colorful leaves fly out of the bowl in all
text: directions, filling the air and swirling around everyone,
text: covering them completely. When the leaves fall away, they
dialog: find themselves in...
scene_heading: EXT. A PATH THROUGH THE PARK (ANIMATED) - DAY
text: ... the ANIMATED WORLD of the Doulton china bowl. Jack and
text: the children are stunned to discover they’re now wearing turn-
text: of-the-century dress. Mary Poppins holds an elegant parasol.
text: While they are still very much real, everything around them
text: is animated.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Wow!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What just happened?
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Where are we?
text: Jack lifts a finger, tapping the air behind him - we hear the
text: ‘tink, tink' of his finger against the bowl.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Looks like we’re in China, so to
dialog: speak.
text: Mary Poppins slides down a porcelain slope to the carriage.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Over here, everyone - this wheel
dialog: won't fix itself.
text: The others manage the slope much less gracefully;
dialog: 48
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Tread lightly, please - this is
dialog: fine porcelain, we don’t want to
text: chip the glaze.
text: Georgie loses his balance completely and tumbles down to the
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Oh Georgie - head up and feet
dialog: beneath you.
dialog: (Turning to the carriage: )
dialog: Excuse me, driver, would you help
dialog: us?
text: The Coachman turns. The children see that he’s actually an
text: IRISH SETTER in uniform.
speaker_heading: COACHMAN
dialog: Well, Mary Poppins! Is it yourself?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But he’s - !
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: But you’re - !
speaker_heading: COACHMAN
dialog: That's right: I’m Irish - also part
dialog: poodle.
dialog: (barks )
dialog: Woof!
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: How wonderful to see you, Shamus.
dialog: So sorry about all this. Would you
text: help Jack lift the carriage while
dialog: the children put the wheel back on?
speaker_heading: COACHMAN
dialog: With pleasure!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (Amazed: )
dialog: She's talking to a dog!
speaker_heading: HORSE
dialog: Well, of course she can talk!
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Take your places, everyone. Ready?
dialog: ... And LIFT!
text: Jack and the Coachman lift the carriage. The children put the
text: wheel on. Mary Poppins uses her scarf to tie it in place.
dialog: 49
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: (As she ties the scarf:)
dialog: Let’s see now, this should do it.
dialog: There we are - shipshape.
speaker_heading: COACHMAN
dialog: Not a bad job at all.
speaker_heading: HORSE
dialog: S'pose it’1l have to do.

speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Back to the nursery we go.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Back already?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Can't we stay in the bowl for a
dialog: while?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I want a carriage ride.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I wouldn’t mind one m’self.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: I suppose it wouldn’t do any harm.
dialog: Shamus, would you mind?
speaker_heading: COACHMAN
dialog: Not in the least. Climb aboard,

scene_heading: ANNABEL, JOHN AND GEORGIE
dialog: Hooray!
speaker_heading: COACHMAN

text: The crowd cheers. In the audience, Georgie notices that
text: Gillie is gone. He looks around; the Wolf is CASTING A LARGE
text: SHADOW onto the canvas wall of the tent as he swings his

text: Weasel come into view as they cross back and forth carrying
text: things. Georgie recognizes one of the items as Gillie.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Gillie!
text: As Mary and Jack take their bows, Annabel suddenly realizes
dialog: that Georgie is gone.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Where's Georgie?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don’t know.
text: They look over just as he leaves through a tent flap. They
text: panic and rush after him.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND THE MUSIC HALL TENT (ANIMATED) - NIGHT
text: Georgie comes out of the tent. The Wolf, Badger and Weasel
text: stand near a period moving van - a motorized cab with an old-
text: fashioned steam engine that pulls a slatted wagon.
dialog: 59
text: They are loading the wagon with all the real belongings from
text: the children’s nursery (not animated).
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Well, well - if it isn’t the boy
dialog: who cracked the bowl. We've waited
dialog: a long time for you Banks children
dialog: to come and visit us - so we could
dialog: pay a visit to your nursery.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: But those are our things!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Not anymore, they aren't.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Give Gillie back!
text: Georgie rushes at the wagon, grabbing Gillie out of the back.
text: The Badger tries to grab it back, but Georgie won't let go.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE (cont'd)
dialog: He’s mine! My mother made him for
dialog: me!
text: John and Annabel run out from the tent, shouting.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Hey! Leave our brother alone!
text: The Wolf cranks the engine and climbs into the cab.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Time to go, boys!
text: The Badger and the Weasel throw boy and giraffe together into
text: the wagon. They slam the slatted door and jump into the cab.
text: The moving van roars off through the back gates, engulfing
text: Annabel and John in exhaust smoke...
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Annabel! Help! John!
speaker_heading: ANNABEL AND JOHN
dialog: Georgie!
text: John and Annabel chase after Georgie...

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We're coming Georgie!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (Shouts: )
dialog: Let me go! I want to go home!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: (Calling back: )
dialog: What home? You’ve lost your home!
text: The twins give chase, but the moving van is getting away -
text: they slow down, exhausted, when suddenly the carriage driven
text: by the Coachman appears out of the shadows behind them.
text: John and Annabel gasp.
text: A hand reaches down and pulls them into the carriage. Seamus
text: turns around to them.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Shamus!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Clyde!
speaker_heading: COACHMAN
dialog: That's right - it’s us!
speaker_heading: HORSE
dialog: Let’s go get your brother back!
text: The chase is on. The two vehicles screech and slide on the
text: china’s glazed surface.
speaker_heading: COACHMAN
dialog: We're gaining on them!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Give it more speed!
text: The Badger shovels more coal into the steam engine. As the
text: van banks up the side of the bowl, Georgie is thrown to the
text: side of the tipping wagon. The carriage is closing in.
speaker_heading: COACHMAN
dialog: Giddy up, big fella!
text: The carriage tips and drives up the side of the bowl. The
text: Wolf swerves left and right cutting them off. The carriage
text: closes the gap.
speaker_heading: COACHMAN (cont'd)
dialog: (To horse: )
dialog: Almost there.
text: John reaches out to Georgie.
dialog: 61
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Georgie!
text: The carriage manages to pull alongside the moving van. The

speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
scene_heading: READY, AND - NOW!
text: - and they leap onto the wagon.
speaker_heading: COACHMAN
dialog: Well done children!
speaker_heading: HORSE
dialog: Give ‘em what for!
text: The carriage recedes into the distance.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Get rid of them!
speaker_heading: WEASEL
dialog: But, sir -
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: You heard me!
text: The Weasel and the Badger climb out and crawl towards the
dialog: children.
text: John and Annabel look down at Georgie.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Oh Georgie! Are you alright?
text: John looks up.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Annabel, look.
text: Annabel turns and sees the Badger and Weasel closing in. She
text: reaches down, grabs a cricket bat from the nursery belongings
text: and swings at the Weasel. The bat misses them and goes
text: flying, chipping the bowl. The chip hits the Badger, who
text: slams into the Weasel, knocking both off the wagon.
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: (To Annabel: )
dialog: Stay with Georgie.
text: Annabel lowers herself into the wagon. She hugs Georgie. They
text: watch as John crawls forward.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Be careful!
dialog: 62
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: What are you doing?
text: John pulls out the pin, detaching the wagon from the cab.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: He did it!
text: John makes his way along the bar back towards the wagon and
text: climbs into the carriage.
text: The Wolf grabs the stoking shovel and swings it hard, hitting
text: the bowl and creating a deep crack in the bowl which travels
text: towards the children’s wagon.
text: The wagon wheel hits the crack which splinters off. They fly
text: up the side of the bowl like a runaway roller coaster. The
text: Wolf loses control of the cab and careens off a bridge into
dialog: the water.
text: The frightened children see an ominous sign ahead: “Caution:
dialog: Edge of Bowl!”
speaker_heading: ANNABEL (cont'd)
dialog: OH NO...!
speaker_heading: THE CHILDREN
text: THE EDGE OF THE BOWL!
text: The children scream as the wagon flies off the edge. They

speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: It’s alright, Georgie, it’s
dialog: alright. You were been having a
dialog: nice sort of nightmare, I must say.
text: Mary Poppins turns on his bedside lamp.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE

speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: But it was real! They stole all our

speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: That’s absurd.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But I had a nightmare like that,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (Turning on light:)
dialog: So did I. It seemed awfully real.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE

text: Georgie moves over and sits on Annabel’s bed, cuddling
dialog: Gillie.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You see, Georgie? That’s why we
dialog: wanted mother’s bowl; we were going
dialog: to sell it to save the house.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (After a beat.)
dialog: I miss mother.
text: The room falls silent. Something flickers ever so briefly in
text: Mary Poppins’ eyes, and then she speaks.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Listen to the three of you. You’re

speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Oh, it’s alright - thank you -
text: Mary Poppins appears at the nursery window above.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Good morning, Jane - I see you’ve
text: bumped into Jack. The children and
dialog: I are heading into town to get
dialog: something fixed. Would you like to
dialog: come with us?
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Work calls, I'm afraid. We have a
dialog: rally today.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: That's right. You ought to give
dialog: Jack one of those flyers.
text: Mary Poppins disappears from the window. As Jack continues
dialog: rescuing Aunt Jane’s flyers:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're Miss Banks, aren’t you? I
dialog: don’t know if you remember me, but
dialog: I used to wave to you when I’d see
dialog: you up there in that very window.
text: In the background, Ellen peers through the letter box.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: (Smiling: )
dialog: Why, yes - Jack. I remember. Call
dialog: me Jane, please.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ‘Course I was much younger then -
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: True - but your smile hasn’t
dialog: changed a bit.
text: (She hands him a flyer.)
dialog: It’s this afternoon, if you can come.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: SPRUCE, eh? Good for you, Jane
dialog: Banks - all us lamplighters know
dialog: what a fine job you’re doing for
dialog: the workers.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: We do our best.
dialog: 67
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You ever need a ladder raised or a
dialog: lamp lit, consider it done.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Why thank you, Jack - Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. THE BANKS FRONT ENTRY HALL — CONTINUOUS
text: Ellen is still peering out through the letter box at Jack and
text: Aunt Jane when Mary Poppins comes down the stairs carrying
text: the Royal Doulton bowl in a cloth bag. She comes up behind
dialog: Ellen.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Polishing the keyhole?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Look at that: Miss Jane’s chattin’
dialog: with that ‘andsome lamplighter -
text: looks as though he’s lit ‘er up as
dialog: well, don’t it? Not that anythin’1l
dialog: ever come of it - she says that
dialog: ship has sailed.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: And I say there are always other
dialog: ships.
text: Michael rushes down the stairs with his briefcase, panicked.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: My alarm clock didn’t ring!
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Oh, dear - let me help you.
text: Mary Poppins puts the bowl down on a side table and TAKES
text: MICHAEL'S BRIEFCASE, handing it to Ellen. Michael gets his
text: coat from the rack and puts it on while Mary Poppins
text: retrieves his hat and umbrella.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m going to be late! That’s all I
dialog: need.
text: Mary Poppins hands him only his hat and umbrella.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: You’re not late yet. Off you go!
text: Mary Poppins opens the door as Michael runs out.
dialog: 68
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOUSE AT 17 CHERRY TREE LANE - CONTINUOUS
text: Michael hurries out the front door of the house, barely
text: noticing Jack and Aunt Jane as he passes them. An ELEGANT
text: WOMAN approaches from the opposite direction, holding a piece
text: of paper with an address on it.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Good morning, Michael.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (Glancing back: )
dialog: Hello - I have to run, forgive me.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Watch where you're going!
text: Michael nearly runs into the ELEGANT WOMAN on the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sorry, excuse me —
text: He dodges the woman and hurries off down the street.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Michael!
speaker_heading: ELEGANT WOMAN
dialog: No it’s fine. I’m looking for
dialog: number nineteen...
scene_heading: AUNT JANE AND JACK
dialog: (together)
text: Just two doors down.
text: They share a laugh.
speaker_heading: ELEGANT WOMAN
dialog: Many thanks. Sincerely.
text: As the Elegant Woman continues on her way, Ellen rushes out
text: holding his briefcase, followed by Mary Poppins, carrying the
dialog: bowl, and the children.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Michael - your briefcase!
dialog: (Too late. He’s gone.)
dialog: He’d leave his ‘ead on the
dialog: breakfast table if it weren’t
dialog: screwed on.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Here - I'll take the briefcase. The
dialog: children and I are heading that way
dialog: on an errand; we can stop by the
dialog: bank afterwards.
dialog: 69
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll give you a lift. My rounds are
dialog: done.
text: He turns his ladder sideways, setting it astride and
text: fastening it to the rear fender of the bike. He buckles it
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Wonderful.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: All aboard - come on.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: On the bicycle?
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: But there are five of us. We can’t
dialog: all fit.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The weight on those wheels alone -
dialog: Mary Poppins, how much do you weigh?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: How...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (Quickly interceding. )
dialog: Never you mind about that - it’s a
dialog: question of balance.
text: Jack kicks off the bike guard as Mary Poppins puts the
text: briefcase in the front basket then holds the bicycle steady.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont'd)
text: (He lifts Annabel onto the
dialog: bike.)
dialog: Annabel here, and then John here.
text: He balances them on one side of the ladder.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Careful!
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (To the twins.)
dialog: Sit up straight. You're not flour
dialog: bags.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Georgie, you’re up front...
text: (He sets Georgie on top of
dialog: the briefcase.)
dialog: And Mary Poppins, you here...
dialog: 70
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Thank you.
text: Mary Poppins hops up onto the other side as Jack gets on the
dialog: bike.
text: ON THE ROOFTOP —
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL BOOM
dialog: Primed and ready, Mr. Binnacle?
speaker_heading: BINNACLE
dialog: Ready and charged, sir.
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW -—
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ready everyone?
speaker_heading: THE CHILDREN
dialog: Ready!
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: (To Mary Poppins: )
dialog: Are you sure this is quite safe?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Not in the slightest. Ready!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Steady...
text: ON THE ROOFTOP —
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL BOOM
dialog: Three, two, one... FIRE!
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW -
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Go!
text: BOOM! Jack launches forward. The bike teeters, looking certain
text: to crash, then Jack gets it under control and pedals off.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STREET IN FRONT OF COUSIN TOPSY’S SHOP - DAY
text: Jack, Mary Poppins and the children ride the precarious
text: bicycle along a city street.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Pull over right ahead. Thank you,
dialog: Jack.
text: Jack stops at the entrance to a narrow alley. Mary Poppins
text: takes the bowl as Jack helps the children off the bike.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Off we go, jiggity-jog!
dialog: 71
scene_heading: EXT. THE ALLEYWAY, COUSIN TOPSY’S SHOP
text: They go down a narrow alleyway past a series of eccentric-
dialog: looking shops.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Never noticed this alley before.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Clearly you’ve never had a Royal
dialog: Doulton bowl that wanted mending.
dialog: (Gestures: )
text: Straight ahead.
text: They arrive at Topsy’s repair shop - a little house at the
text: end with a front door so low that everyone except Georgie
dialog: would have to duck to go inside.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Here we are.
text: Annabel reads the sign that hangs above the little door:
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
scene_heading: “TOPOTREPOLOVSKY’S - All Repairs
dialog: Large and Small Fix-it Shop.”
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Looks as though it’s just a Small
dialog: Fix-it Shop today.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: That’s just what we want. The bowl
dialog: only needs a small fix, after all.
text: She raps on the door with the parrot head of her umbrella.
speaker_heading: PARROT UMBRELLA
dialog: So now my head is a door knocker? I
dialog: suppose my beak might be useful for
dialog: opening cans —
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: “Fuss, fuss, fuss” - don’t be so
dialog: dramatic.
text: Mary Poppins raps on the door again, hears nothing. She
text: pushes the tip of the umbrella through the letter box.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Cousin Topsy?
speaker_heading: TOPSY (0.S.)
text: (A strangely untraceable
dialog: Eastern European accent: )
dialog: Mary Poppins - NO! For the love of
dialog: all that is holy, do not come in!
dialog: 72
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Don’t be so rude!
speaker_heading: TOPSY (0.S.)
dialog: Please stay away, - it is Second
dialog: Wednesday today!
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Second Wednesday... Oh dear, I'd
dialog: forgotten. Still, today or never -
dialog: that’s my motto.
text: Mary Poppins forces the tip of the cane into the keyhole and
text: thwacks the parrot on the top of the head.
speaker_heading: PARROT UMBRELLA
dialog: Ouch!
text: She twists the umbrella, opening the lock, and goes inside.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (To the others: )
dialog: There we are.
scene_heading: INT. TOPSY’S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: They pass through the tiny door into a narrow entry hall, the
text: workshop just ahead.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Follow me.
speaker_heading: TOPSY (0.S.)
dialog: (Annoyed: )
dialog: So in you come. You do not listen
dialog: to Topsy.
text: Mary reaches the doorway to the workshop.
text: Almost instantly, the entire room begins to rotate, FLIPPING
text: UPSIDE DOWN. Nearly everything stays stuck in place.
dialog: TOPSY (dramatic, Bohemian, a restorations artist of the
text: highest order) is at the top of a spiral staircase on the far
text: side of the room; she grips the railings as the room spins.
speaker_heading: TOPSY (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, no - it has begun!
text: The room comes to a stop with the floor where the ceiling
text: should be. Topsy now sits on the ceiling. A chandelier juts
text: up like a fountain in the middle of the room.
speaker_heading: TOPSY (cont'd)
dialog: Now, what do you want?
dialog: 73
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: You have guests, cousin. You might
text: at least greet them at the door.
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: And how am I to do that, please,
dialog: when I am down here up on the
dialog: ceiling?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (With a sigh:)
dialog: Very well, we will come to you.
dialog: Excuse me please, Georgie.
dialog: (To the children: )
dialog: Now this way please. Be very
text: careful on the way - up.
text: Mary Poppins makes her way gracefully down the piles of
text: broken things, the children and Jack following her.
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: Why be careful? Leave it all for
dialog: Topsy to fix. Climb on my shelves,
dialog: step on the toys, kick the little
dialog: china dolls in their faces -
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: John, Annabel, Georgie and Jack -
dialog: this is my cousin -
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: Second cousin - many times removed.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Tatiana Antanasia Cositori
dialog: Topotrepolovsky.
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: But you may call me Topsy.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (To Topsy: )
dialog: That’s an unusual accent you’ve got
dialog: there - where are you from?
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: Well, it’s an interesting story...
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (Cuts her off:)
dialog: We have no idea.
dialog: (Taking the bowl: )
dialog: We need you to fix this bowl, dear.
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: (Reeling back: )
dialog: No, no, no no - }
dialog: (more)
dialog: 74
speaker_heading: TOPSY (cont'd)
dialog: It is, as I have told to you, the
dialog: second Wednesday of the month, when
text: everything is turning turtle.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Turning turtle? What exactly does
dialog: that mean?
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: It means my whole world goes
text: flippity-flop like a turtle on its
dialog: back and I don’t know my up from my
dialog: down, my East from my West -
dialog: (Flirting with Jack:)
dialog: - my Topsy from my bottom-sy -
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Yes, I think we’ve all grasped the
dialog: concept.
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: Oh, good. That’s quick for you.
text: Topsy picks up an instrument that has been badly repaired and
text: shows it to the children.
speaker_heading: TOPSY (cont'd)
dialog: You see, my little ones? Anything I
dialog: fix on Second Wednesday goes
dialog: kerflooey.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (Rolling her eyes:)
dialog: Kerflooey...
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: (Nods, grim: )
dialog: Yes. Kerflooey.
text: Topsy throws the instrument across the room.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Please, cousin, you’ve always said
dialog: you could fix anything -
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: (Turning to Annabel: )
dialog: Sweet girl - you tell Mary Poppins,
dialog: who doesn’t listen, that any other
dialog: day, Tatiana Antanasia Cositori
dialog: Topotrepolovsky can fix anything...
text: “TURNING TURTLE”

speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS

speaker_heading: TOPSY
text: LET’S DO “THE TURTLE SWING!”
text: They all play a hot jazz chorus - with John on bass, Annabel
text: on violin, Georgie on xylophone and Jack going wild on the
text: drums. Mary Poppins conducts; Topsy dances like a whirling
text: dervish. Soon they are all dancing. As the music builds,
text: Topsy floats up in the air and lands on her head, upside down
text: and thoroughly distraught.
speaker_heading: TOPSY (cont'd)
speaker_heading: OH, WOE IS ME
dialog: NOW I’M ON MY HEAD
dialog: HOW CAN THAT BE?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS

speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: that angle.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sounds like fun.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Can we?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Very well. Flippity-flop.
text: Mary Poppins tosses her umbrella into the air and everyone

speaker_heading: ALL

text: Topsy reaches for the bowl. Jack hands it to her.
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: Come. Give your bowl to me. No more
dialog: am I afraid with this new point of
dialog: view.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Good!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (To Topsy: )
dialog: Excuse me, but do you have any idea
dialog: how much our bowl might be worth?
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: In money?
text: (She looks at the bowl,
dialog: considers for a moment: )
dialog: Not very much, I’m afraid. But that
text: doesn’t make it any less beautiful.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: But our mother said it was
dialog: priceless.
speaker_heading: TOPSY
dialog: Yes, I am sure it was - to her.
text: Disappointment is visible in the eyes of all three children.
speaker_heading: TOPSY (cont'd)
dialog: Mary Poppins is right - for once.
dialog: It is all in the way you look at

speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Thank you cousin. Now come along,

text: The children all collect their hats and head out.

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes, spit-spot!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice meeting you, “Topsy Turvy.”
speaker_heading: TOPSY

scene_heading: EXT. THE ALLEYWAY, COUSIN TOPSY’S SHOP - DAY
text: Mary Poppins and Jack come out of the alleyway, the children
text: lagging behind, the twins talking quietly to one another.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Now what do we do?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Well, like Topsy said, maybe we
dialog: should start looking at things
dialog: differently -
text: Everyone looks back as they hear LOUD CREAKS AND CRASHES
text: coming from inside Topsy’s shop. Mary Poppins turns back and
text: continues walking.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
text: Marvelous. It looks as though
text: things are starting to turn around
dialog: for my cousin.
scene_heading: EXT. A STREET NEAR THE BANK - DAY
text: Jack, Mary Poppins and the children ride down the street.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mary Poppins, this is not the

speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (Curtly: )
dialog: Well it is today.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Look, there’s Aunt Jane!
dialog: 80
speaker_heading: THE CHILDREN
dialog: Aunt Jane!
text: Aunt Jane walks just ahead, carrying arm-loads of rally
text: posters and banners. Jack pulls over, the children waving.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Off to the rally, are you, Jane?
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Yes - hello, everyone! All still
dialog: here thank goodness. No one fell
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Say, I could come back and give you
dialog: a hand with all that once I’ve
text: dropped the others at the bank.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Oh no, no - please don’t worry. I’m
dialog: perfectly fine. Really.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Oh, nonsense. The bank is just
text: around the corner, and the children
dialog: and I have plenty of legs to get us
dialog: there. Climb off, everyone - ready,
dialog: and - jump.
text: They do. Jack takes the banners and posters from Aunt Jane,
text: tying them to the back of the bicycle.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Are you sure you don’t mind, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Of course not. I was hoping to stop
dialog: by that rally of yours, anyway.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: You were? Oh, good!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: You should ride up in the front
dialog: basket.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I think she’1ll be better here. Up
dialog: you go now!
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Here, is it? Yes.
text: Jack helps Aunt Jane sit side-saddle on the bar of the

dialog: 81
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE (cont'd)
dialog: Where should I hold on?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (To Aunt Jane:)
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Yes, as ready as I’ll ever be. Oh-!
text: Aunt Jane bursts out laughing, holding on for dear life as
text: Jack pedals off down the street.
text: Mary Poppins and the children watch them cycling away
text: together before Mary Poppins decides-—
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Right, that’s enough.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BANK - DAY
text: WIDE SHOT - Outside, the bank is thronged with people as Mary
text: Poppins leads the children up the steps.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Step along, children.
scene_heading: INT. THE BANK - CONTINUOUS
text: Inside, the bank is a beehive of activity. Mary Poppins
text: enters with the children and strides purposefully toward the
text: Information Desk, the children hurrying to catch up.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (Walking with Annabel: )
dialog: There must be someone at this bank
dialog: who could help us save our house.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: I’m sure father has already asked.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, we haven't. Maybe we can get
dialog: them to see things from a new point
dialog: of view.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Sit over there children.
text: Mary Poppins guides the children over to a bench, gestures
text: for them to sit, then crosses to the INFORMATION DESK CLERK.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Good afternoon, I’m looking for Mr.-
text: A POSTMAN interrupts, his arms full of parcels.
dialog: 82
speaker_heading: POSTMAN
dialog: I‘1l need a signature for these,
dialog: sir.
scene_heading: INFORMATION DESK CLERK
dialog: Of course - excuse me a moment.
text: Mary Poppins purses her lips, nettled. As she waits, she
text: adjusts her hat, gazing into the reflection of a brass lamp.
text: ON THE REFLECTION: The children are visible. Gooding and Frye
text: also appear, having just entered the bank.
text: Frye sees Georgie, smiles and waves. Georgie waves back.
text: Annabel pointedly pushes Georgie’s hand down. Frye’s smile
text: disappears; his face clouds with guilt as he follows Gooding
dialog: upstairs.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (To Annabel: )
dialog: What did you do that for? You hurt
dialog: his feelings.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: You do know who those men are,
dialog: don’t you, Georgie?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: They're the lawyers. He’s the nice
dialog: one.
text: A beat. Annabel turns to John.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Maybe we could convince him to help
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Worth a try.
dialog: (Glancing to the stairs:)
dialog: Today or never. That’s my motto.
dialog: C'mon.
text: ON THE REFLECTION: Mary Poppins watches the children as they
text: lean in together, clearly plotting something.
text: The postman leaves, and the clerk turns back to Mary Poppins.
scene_heading: INFORMATION DESK CLERK

scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE/OUTSIDE WILKINS’ OFFICE - DAY
text: The children hurry up the stairs, following Gooding and Frye,
text: who turn at the top of the steps and disappear around the
text: corner. The children sneak around the corner in pursuit,
text: spying on the lawyers as they go into Wilkins’ office. Miss
text: Farthing sees them.
speaker_heading: MISS FARTHING
dialog: Is there something I can do for
dialog: you, children?
text: The twins freeze; Georgie, though, sees the new jar of
text: toffees on Miss Farthing’s desk.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: May I have a sweet, please?
speaker_heading: MISS FARTHING
dialog: Yes of course, dear. You all can.
text: She takes the lid off the jar, gesturing for them to come
text: over. As they do so, the muffled voices of Wilkins and the
text: lawyers can be heard emanating from behind the office door...
speaker_heading: GOODING

speaker_heading: FRYE

speaker_heading: GOODING

scene_heading: INT. WILKINS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: How many repossessions so far this
dialog: month?
dialog: 84
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: 19, sir - and we have nearly that
dialog: amount scheduled for next week
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Who would have thought this Slump
dialog: would be so good for business, eh?
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: (Gathering his courage: )
dialog: I wonder, Mr. Wilkins, if, perhaps,
dialog: as Michael Banks is an employee,
dialog: you might consider giving him a few
dialog: more weeks to pay off his loan.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: And lose our chance to get that
dialog: house? I don't like to lose, Mr.
dialog: Frye.
dialog: (Hitting the intercom: )
dialog: Didn't I ask for tea, Miss Farthing?
scene_heading: INT/EXT. WILKINS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: MISS FARTHING
dialog: (On the intercom: )
dialog: Yes, sir. Right away, Mr. Wilkins.
dialog: (To the children: )
dialog: Why don’t you all help yourselves?
text: Miss Farthing goes off to get the tea. The children creep
text: over to Wilkins' door. Annabel points to the sign on it.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (Whispering: )
dialog: “Office of the Bank Chairman.” We
dialog: can’t go in there.
text: The children peer through the crack in the door, listening.
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: (Nervously: )
dialog: It’s just that, well, his family
dialog: has suffered tremendous hardship
dialog: this past year, and -
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: You're not giving Banks one second
dialog: longer to pay off that loan - do I
dialog: make myself clear?
text: Wilkins swings his pocket watch. From Georgie’s POV, he can
text: see Wilkins’ shadow on the wall - as the firelight flickers,
text: it changes into THE ANIMATED SHADOW HE SAW ON THE CIRCUS TENT
dialog: and back again.

speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Look!
speaker_heading: JOHN
speaker_heading: SHHH!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE

speaker_heading: WILKINS (0.S.)

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: You can’t steal our house! I’m

speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Steal your - ? Who are you?
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: These are the Banks children.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: ... Are they?
dialog: (He smiles. To Georgie: )
dialog: Come here, boy. I think you may
dialog: have misunderstood -
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Let’s go, Georgie!
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: RUN!
text: Miss Farthing backs in, carrying a large tea tray.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Close that door, Miss Farthing.
text: Georgie and the twins race past Miss Farthing, ducking
text: beneath the tea tray, nearly sending it flying.
speaker_heading: WILKINS (cont'd)
dialog: Fool! STOP THEM!

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: GEORGIE
speaker_heading: FATHER, HELP!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What is it? What’s happened?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What on Earth are you talking about?
text: Wilkins crosses directly to Michael.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: I'm afraid your children burst into
dialog: my office just now, Banks -
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What??
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: I was just seeing if anything could
dialog: be done about extending your loan,
dialog: when they came in claiming I was
dialog: trying to steal your house.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: He is - we heard him!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Mr. Wilkins is trying to help us!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Then why was he chasing us?
text: Wilkins digs into a pocket, pulling out a handful of toffees.
dialog: 87
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: I just thought they might stop

dialog: I offered them some sweets.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I am so sorry, Mr. Wilkins.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Let’s just see it doesn’t happen
dialog: again -
text: He places a toffee in Georgie’s hand, one in John’s and one
dialog: in Annabel’s.
speaker_heading: WILKINS (cont'd)
dialog: (To the children: )
dialog: After all, you don’t want your
dialog: father losing his position on
dialog: account of you, now do you?
dialog: (Stepping close to
dialog: Michael, kindly: )
dialog: Now, I know time is running short,
dialog: Banks, but I want you to have every

dialog: stay in my office on Friday evening
dialog: until the last stroke of midnight,
dialog: you have my word.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: (Turning to the lawyers: )
dialog: Gentlemen -

speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (To her father: )
dialog: But Father, he really did it -
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Not another word!
dialog: (to Mary Poppins)
dialog: Take them home this instant. We’1l

speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Now we’ve done it, haven't we? I
dialog: don’t think I’ve ever seen father
dialog: that upset with us before.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: But we were telling the truth!
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: That doesn’t matter, Georgie. We
dialog: got him into trouble - and he
dialog: doesn’t even know we broke mother’s

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Everything we’ve tried to fix,

scene_heading: EXT. THE STREETS OF LONDON - DUSK
text: The children walk through the fog, deep in thought. Mary

text: They come to a crossroads. Annabel pauses, looking around.
text: The fog is getting so thick it’s difficult to make out the

speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Which way do we go, Mary Poppins?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Why would you ask me? The three of
dialog: you are leading the way, after all.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Us?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But we were -
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
text: - walking around in a fog.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: No, we weren’t - I mean, yes, we

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: - we were only talking.
dialog: 89
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Yes - too focused on where you’ve
dialog: been to pay attention to where
dialog: you're going.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But father told us to go straight
dialog: home!
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: He'll be furious if we’re late.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Not much to be done about that now,
dialog: is there?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: (Worried: )
dialog: Are we lost, then?
speaker_heading: JACK (0.S.)
dialog: That would depend on where you want

text: A light appears through the fog. Jack smiles down at them
text: from a streetlamp that hangs from an archway behind them.
speaker_heading: JOHN/ANNABEL/GEORGIE
dialog: Jack!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: At your service.
text: Jack climbs halfway down and sits on a ledge just above Mary
text: Poppins and the children, peering down at them.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont'd)
dialog: Say, what’s with all the glum faces?
dialog: Lost sixpence and found a penny?
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: We've made a mess of everything.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Father’s furious with us.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: And we can’t find our way home.
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why, it’s what we lamplighters call

text: He flickers the streetlamp on and off in a rhythmic pattern.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont'd)
dialog: Time to send out the call to arms:

speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Just as Jack said - we follow the
dialog: light.
text: She steps onto the base of the lamp, which magically

text: DANCE SEQUENCE - which includes Jack and all the leeries

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Kick and prance - it means “dance.”

dialog: more time, we're about to lose this

text: them rustling down the cobblestones.
text: At 17 Cherry Tree Lane, Jack, Angus, and two other leeries
text: search through boxes in the back of a moving van filled with
text: the family’s possessions. Aunt Jane comes out of the house,
text: carrying a box. Jack hurries over to help Aunt Jane with it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Here, Jane - let me help you with
dialog: that.
text: He takes the box. Aunt Jane nods toward the van.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Thank you. No luck?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (Shaking his head: )
dialog: We can look through everything
dialog: again if you like.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: There’s no point. It’s nearly
dialog: midnight - we tried our best. Thank
dialog: you, Jack. And thanks to your
dialog: friends for helping us.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Of course. Anything for you.
text: Aunt Jane smiles.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: We'll be out in a moment.

scene_heading: INT. THE BANKS SITTING ROOM/FRONT ENTRY HALL - NIGHT
text: Michael stands in the entryway to the sitting room. The
text: furniture is gone; the curtains have been taken down. Aunt
text: Jane comes in and crosses to Michael’s side.
text: A pause as their situation sinks in. They look around the
text: empty sitting room one last time.
text: The children come downstairs with suitcases, followed by Mary
text: Poppins, carpetbag in hand.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
text: The children have packed up the
dialog: last of their things themselves.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well done, all of you.
text: (Putting an arm around
dialog: Georgie: )
dialog: Have you got Gillie?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: Yes, father.
text: Ellen comes out of the kitchen with suitcases.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Good riddance to that old kitchen.
dialog: Never could figure out that stove.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, then... we’ve spent every
dialog: last moment we can here. It’s time
dialog: to say goodbye.
dialog: (His voice echoing: )
dialog: Goodbye, old friend!
scene_heading: AUNT JANE AND THE CHILDREN
dialog: Goodbye, old friend!

scene_heading: EXT. THE HOUSE AT 17 CHERRY TREE LANE - CONTINUOUS
text: The family steps outside, surprised to discover a handful of
text: neighbors and friends coming over from the Admiral’s house -
text: Miss Lark and the Milkman are there, along with the Admiral
dialog: and Binnacle.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (Knowing the answer: )
dialog: What are you all doing here so late?
dialog: 102
speaker_heading: BINNACLE
dialog: We've been waitin’ to see you off.
speaker_heading: MILKMAN
dialog: We'd be here no matter what the hour.
speaker_heading: MISS LARK
dialog: If you and your family should ever
dialog: need a place to stay, Willoughby and
dialog: I would be happy for the company.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Thank you, Miss Lark. Jane has
dialog: offered to put us up in her flat, at
dialog: least for the time being.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: For as long as you like.
dialog: (To Ellen: )
dialog: I wish you’d come with us, Ellen.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Don’t you worry ‘bout me. I got a
dialog: nice room fixed up at my sister’s.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: You won’t leave us, will you, Mary
dialog: Poppins?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Oh, don’t be silly.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: She says she’s not leaving until
text: the door opens.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (He laughs, perplexed: )
dialog: In any case, your home is with us.
dialog: (To Georgie, smiling: )
dialog: I’m pleased she got caught on your
dialog: string, Georgie.
text: Georgie hurries forward as Michael is about to lock the door.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: My kite - I forgot my kite!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Very well - but be quick about it.
text: Georgie runs into the house. Binnacle pushes the Admiral’s
text: wheelchair over to Michael.
speaker_heading: BINNACLE
dialog: The Admiral has something he would
dialog: like to give you, Mr. Banks, Sir.
dialog: 103
text: The Admiral hands him a beautifully-wrought ship in a bottle.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL BOOM
dialog: The H.M.S. Glad Tidings - I
dialog: commanded her myself. May she guide
dialog: you safely into port.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Thank you so much, Admiral.
dialog: (He salutes: )
dialog: I’ll take good care of her.
text: The Admiral checks his pocket watch.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL BOOM
dialog: It’s nearly eight bells, Mr.
dialog: Binnacle. Time to man our posts.
speaker_heading: BINNACLE
dialog: Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Banks, sir.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Goodbye, Mr Binnacle.
text: As Binnacle wheels the Admiral off, Georgie comes out of the
text: house, his arms wrapped around his kite.
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I found it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m not so sure that will get off
dialog: the ground anymore - it looks more
dialog: glue than kite.
text: Michael takes a few steps toward the house, then glances back.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (cont'd)
dialog: Georgie, did you patch that up with
dialog: one of my old drawings? It looks
dialog: like you've done a fine job, there.
text: Michael gestures for Georgie to hand him the kite. He runs a
text: hand over the patches that Georgie has made from his sketch
text: of Michael, Kate and the children.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (cont'd)
dialog: (kneels )
dialog: Look at that - all of us together
text: in front of the...
text: As he holds up the kite, light from the streetlamp hits it
text: from behind. Printed lettering, upside down and backwards,
text: shows through the patches. Michael blinks. He turns the kite
text: over and pieces together the words written on the patches...
scene_heading: CERTIFICATE OF SHARES.
dialog: 104
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: What is it, father?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wait..!
dialog: (Stunned and elated: )
dialog: “Certificate of Shares!” This is it -
dialog: this is what we’ve been looking for!
dialog: (Suddenly panicked: )
dialog: We have to get to the bank! What
dialog: time is it - anyone??
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (Checking his watch: )
text: Seven minutes to midnight.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Seven minutes? It’s not enough. We
dialog: need to make it to the bank by
dialog: midnight.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Take the van.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No, it’s no good. You still won't
dialog: make it in time.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: What can we do?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (Defeated: )
dialog: Nothing. We can’t turn back time.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: (After a beat: )
dialog: Why not? “Everything is possible -
dialog: even the impossible.”
text: She looks to Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins smiles.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Can we do it, then, Mary Poppins?
dialog: Can we turn back time?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: I don’t see why that couldn’t be
dialog: arranged.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That’s ridiculous.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Indeed it is, Michael. It’s nonsense.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Foolishness!
dialog: 105
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It makes no sense! And if it makes
dialog: no sense-
speaker_heading: JOHN/ANNABEL/ GEORGIE
dialog: It can’t be true!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What are you all talking about?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Never you mind. You just get to the
dialog: bank as fast as possible with that
dialog: kite, and leave the rest to us.
text: Mary Poppins guides Michael and Aunt Jane over to the van. As
text: they climb into the cab:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But how will you - ?
speaker_heading: THE CHILDREN
dialog: Go!
text: Michael nods. He closes the door and they drive off. Mary
text: Poppins turns to Jack. They walk to his bicycle.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: We'll need a lot of help, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good as done! Angus, gather the
dialog: leeries!
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Children, help me ready the
dialog: bicycle!
text: Angus and the leeries run to their bicycles. Georgie and the
text: twins hurry to Jack’s bicycle, flipping the ladder sideways
text: across the rear fender. Mary Poppins hikes her skirts and
text: climbs onto the bicycle seat sidesaddle.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: I'll take the reins this time -
dialog: speed is of the essence.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Have you ever ridden a bicycle like
dialog: this before?
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: (An impatient sigh: )
dialog: Oh, please - how different can it
dialog: be from riding an elephant?
dialog: (more)
dialog: 106
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS (cont'd)
dialog: Climb aboard everyone. Ready,
dialog: and... up! Now all we have to do is
dialog: turn back time.
text: The bicycle rockets down the lane, Mary Poppins leading the
text: leeries, not bothering - and somehow not needing - to pedal.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MALL AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT
text: HIGH ANGLE as Mary Poppins, Jack and the children race down
text: the Mall with Angus and the other two leeries behind them. At
text: each turn, more leeries appear, swerving bicycles around
text: corners, squeezing through hedges and leaping curbs to join
dialog: the pack.
scene_heading: INT. WILKINS’ OFFICE - NIGHT/CONTINUOUS
text: Wilkins, meanwhile, is in his office with Gooding and Frye.
text: Big Ben can be seen through the window behind them.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: A good week’s work, gentlemen.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Thank you sir.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
text: (Pulls out his pocket
dialog: watch, checks the time.)
dialog: Looks as if Banks won't be joining
dialog: us tonight.
speaker_heading: FRYE
text: He does have a few more minutes.
dialog: You said you’d wait until the last
dialog: stroke of midnight.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Of course. I know that. So we'll
dialog: wait - I’m aman of my word.
text: Wilkins unwraps a toffee and pops it into his mouth, handing

scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BIG BEN - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT/INT. RESIDENTIAL STREET/VAN - TRAVELING - NIGHT

speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: There’s only five minutes left, I
dialog: think!
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP OF PARLIAMENT/BIG BEN - NIGHT/INTERCUT
text: Twenty leeries, Mary Poppins and the twins stand on the
text: rooftop of Parliament next to Big Ben. Angus helps Georgie
text: climb up the last few rungs of a ladder, Jack right behind.
text: John gestures to one of the Leeries for his cap.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (Hushed urgency: )
dialog: Good - now over to the tower!
text: The leeries all grab ladders and rush to the tower. John,
text: head down in his Leerie cap, lifts a ladder and starts to
dialog: follow them.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont'd)
dialog: Sorry - this is as far as you go.
dialog: (Taking the ladder: )
text: Back in a flash.
text: Jack hurries to the tower throwing his ladder to Angus.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont'd)
dialog: C’mon.
text: Jack runs up to the wall and begins to climb. Angus splits
text: the ladder and throws up the top half to jack.
text: Jack jams the ladder diagonally against the wall. Angus
text: throws up another ladder is passed up to him. He places that
text: on the opposite diagonal to the first, and start to climb up
text: the ladder as Angus starts to climb below him.
text: The others put their ladders against the wall and climb up
text: behind him, passing ladders overhead.
text: It is a hair-raisingly dangerous process that looks almost
dialog: certain to end in disaster.
text: Mary Poppins and the children watch from THE ROOFTOP as Jack
text: climbs up to a ledge. A pigeon suddenly rushes out at him,
text: making him drop his ladder. He loses his balance and hangs
text: from the ledge.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: I can’t watch!
text: Mary Poppins shakes her head in disapproval.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: You would think they’d never done
dialog: this before.
dialog: 108
text: BACK ON THE TOWER, Jack climbs into an arch, having nearly
text: reached the clock’s face. He looks up, realizing the overhang
text: prevents them from reaching it.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: (Calls up to him:)
dialog: What are we going to do?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (Shouting down: )
dialog: I've got an idea! C’mon!
text: Jack jumps into the arch. Angus climbs up onto the ledge
text: outside the arch. Jack calls down to the Leeries below.
speaker_heading: JACK (cont'd)
dialog: Ladder!
text: Another Leerie climbs up, a second passes up two ladders,
text: jumping up behind him.
text: They interlock the ladders. Jack places it out over the edge,
text: like a diving board.
text: He walks out onto the end of the ladder, as two Leeries hold
text: it steady from inside the arch.
text: Jack turns round at the very edge, a huge drop below him. He
text: steadies himself.
text: ON THE ROOFTOP - the children gasp as they watch Jack fly up
text: into the air, backlit by the glowing face of Big Ben’s dial.
text: AT THE TOWER - Jack lands on the ledge beneath the clock’s
text: face. He opens a small hinged window set into the face of the
text: clock and squeezes inside.
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE BIG BEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack squints around the tower, finding the gas main. He
text: cranks it closed, shutting off the gaslights that illuminate
text: all the faces of the clock.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP OF PARLIAMENT/BIG BEN - CONTINUOUS/INTERCUT
text: The children watch as Big Ben goes dark.
text: Jack sticks his head out of the open window. Angus calls up
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: You can turn the time back now!
text: Jack peers up at the enormous face of the clock.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How? I can’t reach the hands.
dialog: 109
text: Down below, Mary Poppins sighs, growing exasperated.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Ohhh - ! Honestly!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: They’d better hurry. We have less
dialog: than a minute to go.
text: Up on the tower, the leeries seem to have run out of ideas.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: We’re too late, Jack!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There’s got to be a way!
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
speaker_heading: LOOK!
text: Suddenly, Mary Poppins appears, floating before the clock
text: face, holding her umbrella. As she descends, she pushes the
text: minute hand backward five and a half minutes. The leeries
dialog: cheer.
scene_heading: INT. WILKINS’ OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Wilkins sits at his desk, flanked by Gooding and Frye, eying
text: his pocket watch.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Three, two, one and...
dialog: (Pause. )
dialog: Why hasn't Big Ben chimed?
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: Perhaps your watch is running fast.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Don’t be a simpleton - my watch has
dialog: never run fast.
text: Wilkins rises from his desk, pushing Frye out of the way, and
text: turns toward the window. The clock face on Big Ben is dark.
speaker_heading: WILKINS (cont'd)
dialog: What’s happened? Big Ben’s gone
dialog: dark.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP OF PARLIAMENT/BIG BEN - CONTINUOUS/INTERCUT
text: Mary Poppins calls down to Jack.
speaker_heading: MARY POPPINS
dialog: Relight the clock, Jack - quickly!
dialog: 110
text: Jack rushes back inside to relight the clock.
scene_heading: INT. WILKINS’ OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Wilkins paces in frustration. Suddenly, the clock face on Big
text: Ben relights in the distance.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Look! They've relit Big Ben.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: But that time is wrong - the clock
dialog: must have stopped.
text: Wilkins glances out the window to the street below, noticing
text: a van pulling up. He sees Michael getting out.
speaker_heading: WILKINS (cont'd)
dialog: That’s Banks!
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: (Excited: )
dialog: He’s made it in time!
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Not yet he hasn’t! Go down there
text: and see that he doesn’t get inside
dialog: until that blasted clock strikes
dialog: twelve.
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: But, sir -
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Now, Mr. Frye!
scene_heading: INT/EXT. THE FRONT DOOR OF THE BANK - CONTINUOUS
text: On the street down below, Michael grabs the kite from the
dialog: van.
text: Michael and Aunt Jane hurry over to the bank.
text: Just as Michael starts to open the door, though...
text: Gooding and Frye rush through the lobby and grab the door’s
text: handles from the INSIDE.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: Lock it, Mr Frye.
text: OUTSIDE, Michael thinks the door is locked. He knocks.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL/AUNT JANE
dialog: Hello! Let us in please! We need to
dialog: get in!
dialog: 111
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Somebody let us in, please. Hello -
dialog: is anyone there?
text: INSIDE, Frye grows increasingly distraught.
text: OUTSIDE, Michael glances at the kite in his hands.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Jane - let’s go fly a kite!
text: Michael and Aunt Jane run back round the side of the bank and
text: desperately try to fly the kite up to Wilkins office.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (cont'd)
dialog: (Points at the window: )
dialog: There it is! It’s the one with the
dialog: light.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Is he there?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I think so, the light’s on.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Ok, here - let me hold it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I‘1l unspool it. You run. Go on -
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: One, two, three...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Go!
scene_heading: INT/EXT. WILKINS’ OFFICE/BANK DOORS - CONTINUOUS/INTERCUT
text: As Wilkins settles into his office chair, the kite flies into
text: view outside the window behind him.
text: DOWN BELOW, Michael and Aunt Jane are flying the kite, trying
text: to position it outside the balcony so Wilkins will see it.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: It won’t work - He’s never going to
dialog: see it!
text: As BIG BEN BEGINS TO TOLL MIDNIGHT, Mary Poppins appears in
text: the sky behind Michael and Aunt Jane, umbrella in hand. She
text: takes a breath and gently blows. The wind rises, the windows
text: fly open and the kite breaks free from its string...
text: «+. floating into WILKINS’ OFFICE. It hits Wilkins in the
text: back of the head, before landing on his desk.
dialog: 112
text: DOWN BELOW - Michael and Aunt Jane rush back to pull on the
dialog: bank doors.
text: INSIDE, Gooding continues to resist - but Frye can’t take it
text: anymore. He lets go of the handle and steps back. Gooding
text: goes sprawling as the door swings open and Michael and Aunt
text: Jane rush inside, thinking the men have unlocked the door.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh - thank you so much.
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Thank you!
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: Hurry, Mr. Banks!
text: Frye catches Gooding glaring at him.
speaker_heading: GOODING
dialog: What!
text: In the OFFICE, Wilkins stares at the kite on his desk,
text: bewildered. He sees the words “Certificate of Shares” peering
text: through a hole in the kite.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: What is this?
text: Michael bursts through the open door just as Big Ben chimes
dialog: its final note.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It’s what we’ve been looking for.
scene_heading: EXT. CHERRY TREE LANE, THE ADMIRAL’S ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: ADMIRAL BOOM (cont'd)
dialog: Mr. Binnacle - Big Ben has finally
dialog: got it right.
scene_heading: INT. WILKINS’ OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Michael gently peels a piece of the share certificate off the
text: kite. Wilkins, Aunt Jane, Mary Poppins, Jack, the children,
text: and the lawyers watch as he places it with the rest of the
text: share certificate, which lies on the desk - in fragments, but
text: nearly complete.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And this one goes here...
dialog: 113
speaker_heading: AUNT JANE
dialog: Does it matter if it’s all cut up
dialog: in bits? Is it still worth
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: It’s valid so long as all the
dialog: pieces are there.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: (Through gritted teeth: )
dialog: Is that so?
text: Michael examines the kite, searching for the final piece.
dialog: It’s not there.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Georgie, there was one more piece -
text: a corner piece with a lot of
dialog: signatures. Do you remember it?
speaker_heading: GEORGIE
dialog: I must have thrown it out. I’m
dialog: sorry, father.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, it’s alright, Georgie -
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: No, it isn’t. I’m afraid you have a
dialog: problem, Banks. Without those
dialog: signatures, you have no bank
dialog: shares, no house - you have
dialog: nothing.
text: Michael turns, looking at Wilkins with new eyes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: But he knows you have bank shares!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He’s been planning this all along!
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Take your children out of here,
dialog: Banks. I’ve heard enough of their
dialog: lies.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (Eyes blazing with anger: )
dialog: Don’t you dare insult my children -
dialog: don’t you DARE! They’re not lying
dialog: and you know it. I only wish I had
dialog: believed them sooner.
dialog: (Turning to his children: )
dialog: (more)
dialog: 114
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (cont'd)
dialog: You all had him pegged right from
dialog: the start.
dialog: (To Wilkins: )
dialog: Take the house - go ahead.

dialog: the children: )
dialog: I have everything I need right
dialog: here.
text: A double door that leads into an adjacent boardroom swings
text: open. MR. DAWES, JR. enters (80s - full of vigor).
speaker_heading: MR. DAWES, JR.
dialog: He has you there, Willie.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Uncle Dawes?? What on earth are you
dialog: doing here?
speaker_heading: MR. DAWES, JR.
dialog: A little bird told me that you’ve
dialog: been trying to cheat the Banks
dialog: family out of their shares in
dialog: Fidelity Fiduciary.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That he has, we heard him.
text: Dawes glances over to Mary Poppins’ parrot umbrella. The
text: umbrella gives him a sly wink.
speaker_heading: MR. DAWES, JR.
dialog: I also hear you've been telling the
dialog: whole of London I’ve gone loony. The
dialog: only loony thing I did is trust you
dialog: to look after this bank.
speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: You can’t be serious! I’ve nearly
dialog: doubled the profits of this bank.
speaker_heading: MR. DAWES, JR.
dialog: Yes, by wringing it out of our
dialog: customer's pockets. Their trust in
dialog: us built this bank - and now you've
dialog: squandered every last bit of their
dialog: good will. So I’m back, and you're
dialog: out.
dialog: (To Gooding and Frye:)
dialog: See my nephew to the door, would
dialog: you, gentlemen?
speaker_heading: FRYE
dialog: Yes, sir, Mr. Dawes.

speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Get your hands off me -
dialog: (Shrugs them off:)
dialog: You’re not fit to run this bank!
text: They are gone.
speaker_heading: MR. DAWES, JR.

speaker_heading: MR. DAWES, JR.
dialog: I'd like to tell you a little

text: They gather beside him. As “FEED THE BIRDS” plays under:
speaker_heading: MR. DAWES, JR. (cont'd)
dialog: Once upon a time there was a man
dialog: with a wooden leg named Smith - Oh
dialog: no, no, no. Not that one. There was
dialog: little boy named Michael who wanted
dialog: to give his tuppence to a bird lady
dialog: - but in the end, and after a
dialog: little persuasion, he decided to
dialog: give it to his father instead.
dialog: Michael’s father - your grandfather
dialog: - gave that tuppence to this bank
dialog: and he asked us to guard it well.
dialog: We did just that, and thanks to
dialog: several quite clever investments -
dialog: if I do say so myself...
dialog: (Turning to Michael: )
dialog: That tuppence has grown into quite
dialog: a sum!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MR. DAWES, JR.
dialog: (With a smile:)
dialog: Really, Michael. Enough, in fact,
dialog: to pay off that loan you took. The

speaker_heading: WILKINS
dialog: Why not - I’ll give it a go.
speaker_heading: BALLOON LADY
