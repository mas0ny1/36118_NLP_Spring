scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: FRANK MOSES lies awake in bed, waiting for the beginning
text: of the day. 4:59 AM changes to 5:00 and he gets up.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN
text: Wearing a tattered bathrobe, Frank watches his coffee
dialog: brew.
text: He's compact and in good shape with broad shoulders and
text: close-cropped hair. He could be 50s, could be 60s - he
text: has this grizzled quality that makes it tough to tell.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Like the rest of the house, the living room is only
text: nominally furnished: a sofa, lamp, and a shelf of records.
text: Frank cranks out a set of pushups.
text: Frank cranks out jumping jacks.
text: Frank cranks out sit-ups. Not crunches... sit-ups.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Frank eats two eggs and dry toast at the small table.
text: One small frying pan, one plate, one knife, and one fork
text: are set in the rack to dry.
scene_heading: EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Wearing a devastatingly uncool sun hat, Frank picks a
text: lone weed from the dirt around his roses, then stands
text: back to admire them: they're withered and sickly.
text: He looks over sourly at the roses next door: a dazzling
dialog: array of color.
text: A young MOM comes out of the house with a baby ina
dialog: stroller.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Hi, Mr. Moses.
text: Frank puts on a smile and gives her a wave.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

speaker_heading: CHECKOUT COUNTER
text: A teenage CASHIER eyes Frank as she rings him up.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They're all right.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Frank puts his groceries away, revealing that his cabinets
text: are already filled with cans. He carefully places the
text: new ones in back, rotating his stock.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Frank goes through his mail, tossing the junk, leaving
text: only one letter: a green envelope. He tears it open: a
dialog: check from the U.S. Government.
text: Pulling an LP from a shelf of vinyl records, Frank drops
text: it onto the stereo and lowers the needle.
text: Picking up the phone, he takes a deep breath and dials.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.0.)
dialog: May I have your social?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Five four three, six six, two two
dialog: nine one. Pension services please.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.0.)
dialog: Thank you Mr. Moses. Please hold
dialog: for your representative.
text: There's a series of CLICKS as the call is transferred.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - INT. HUGE OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Rows of cubicles stretch out beneath the fluorescent
text: lighting, filled with operators on headsets.
dialog: 3.
dialog: SARAH ROSS, older then 30, but we won't say more than
text: that, sits in a cubicle spruced up with spider plants,
text: postcards, and pictures.
text: She's pretty, conservative looking, and bored.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hi, this is Sarah.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey. It's Frank Moses.
text: She immediately brightens.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hey Frank. What's going on?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nothing really. I was just calling
dialog: because I didn't get my check again.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh jeez. I can't believe they
dialog: haven't worked this out. I'll
dialog: make sure they get another one out
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's no big deal. Whenever you
dialog: get around to it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm just sorry this happened again.
text: Frank leans back, tearing up his check.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What are you gonna do?
text: A pause draws out between them.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: Well, I guess...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So how are your roses doing?
text: Frank hurriedly answers...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's a massacre. I've got rust
dialog: and mold. Now I've sprayed them
dialog: so much they have chemical burns.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You try soapy water?
dialog: He lights
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That works?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I swear. Hey what are you listening
dialog: to?
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's The Chirping Crickets; Buddy
dialog: Holly's first album in '57.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Never heard it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's before your time. Hell, it's
dialog: before my time, but it's an amazing
dialog: record. It has the first released
dialog: version of "That'll Be the Day."
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You have a lot of free time, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Little bit. Yeah.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't have the foggiest idea
dialog: what to do with myself.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What did you do before you retired?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I was in the diplomatic corps.
text: This strikes a chord.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Really? I'd give anything to travel
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Believe me, it's not so fun when
dialog: it's business.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I just want to quit my job and
dialog: move to Spain for six months.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You should. You'd have an amazing
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I can see why retirement would be
dialog: hard. Maybe what you need is to
text: fall in love with something new.
text: Frank smiles.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah. I guess so.
text: An annoying looking woman with a pinched face appears at
text: the edge of Sarah's cubicle.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: My supervisor. I gotta go.
text: Sarah hangs up and aggressively stares the woman down.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)

scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Heading inside, Frank sorts through his mail. Two pieces
text: of junk and another green envelope. He smiles.
scene_heading: INT. HUGE OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Sarah's on her headset.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You need excitement. A passion.
dialog: Something that makes you feel alive.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - LATER
text: Frank dumps a can of spinach into a pot.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Excitement is overrated.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How can you say that? Everyone
dialog: needs excitement. The most I get
dialog: is fighting with my mother.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: She keeps trying to set me up on
dialog: blind dates with her bridge
dialog: partners' kids. She just told me
dialog: she's worried I'm gay.
dialog: (suddenly concerned)
dialog: I'm not, by the way.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good to know.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I think we need to talk about
dialog: something else.
text: Frank can't help but grin.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What are you reading this week?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Just a romance.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Come on.
text: There's a long guilty beat.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's called Love's Savage Secret.
text: Frank mulls this over.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is it good?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's terrible! I love it! The
dialog: lead is a sort of a Britney/Lindsay
dialog: character marooned on this island
text: with her tennis pro and a prince.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Who's Britney Lindsay?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Very funny.
text: Frank was serious, but lets it go.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey, hold on a second, I want you
dialog: to hear this.
text: He carefully puts on a record and drops the needle. Buddy
text: Holly's THAT'LL BE THE DAY echoes out.
text: They both listen.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I like this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's cool, right?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah.
text: They listen for another minute.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: I better be getting back to work.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, course. I didn't mean to
dialog: keep you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm glad you did. I'll talk to
dialog: you soon?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You bet.

scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Frank climbs into bed and turns out the light.
text: The clock changes from 10:59 to 11:00. He lies in the
text: darkness, staring up at the ceiling, waiting to get tired.
text: THAT'LL BE THE DAY, fades to a close.
speaker_heading: BUDDY HOLLY (V.0.)
dialog: That'll be the day-ay-ay that I

scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Frank lies on his bed, staring at the ceiling.
text: It's 3:22.
text: He picks up the glass beside his bed, but it's empty.
text: Getting up, he shrugs into his tattered bathrobe.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
text: Frank shuffles out of his bedroom and down the hall to
dialog: the bathroom.
text: But as he passes the stairs, the CAMERA HOLDS on the
text: darkness of the stairwell...
text: ...and the darkness suddenly comes alive with motion: THREE
text: COMMANDOS in hi-tech body armor, night-vision, and weaponry
dialog: are right there.
text: From a small case, the leader takes out a full syringe.
text: The second reaches past him with a snoop scope linked to
text: his heads up display: the hall is clear, the door at the
text: far end swinging closed.
text: They move silently into the hall, listening to the WATER
text: RUN: the leader with the syringe, the second empty-handed,
text: ready for the take down, the third with a machine pistol.
text: The bathroom door stands ajar, spilling out bright light.
text: The commandos lift their night-vision as they move down
text: the hall, past the guest room, closing in.
text: WHAM! They kick in the door revealing...
dialog: ...the empty bathroom...
text: ...as Frank steps out of the darkened guest room behind
text: them in his robe and bare feet.
text: The three men whip around, startled...
text: WHAP! The commando closest to Frank goes down.
dialog: 9.
text: The second swings, but his legs are swept from under him,
text: Frank's heel crushing his throat as he hits the floor.
text: The leader lunges with the syringe, but it's twisted out
text: of his hand and suddenly in his arm... plunger pressed.
text: Staring at Frank, the commando's eyes flutter and drop.
text: Frank is left standing alone amidst the bodies. He isn't
text: even breathing hard.
text: He crouches down, looking them over without emotion.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Frank grabs a sledge hammer at the bottom of the stairs,
text: steps to the middle of the room and swings.
text: CRACK! A thin layer of cement shatters.
text: Sweeping fragments away, he pulls out a buried locker.
text: Inside are bricks of cash and an array of passports.
text: Frank quickly stuffs a satchel. Then he unwraps an old
text: 1911 model .45 semiautomatic and adds it as well.
text: Finally he grabs an old set of miliary dog tags and puts
text: them in his pocket.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Frank finishes dressing, picks up the phone, and dials.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.0.)
dialog: May I have your social?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Five four three, six six, two two
dialog: nine one. Status RED.
text: He hangs up and heads out.
text: But the phone RINGS.
text: He stops, listening to it ECHOING EERILY through the house.
text: Finally he picks it up, holding it to his ear, waiting.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.0.)
dialog: Frank Moses?
text: Without answering, Frank moves beside the window, up
text: against the wall, slightly pulling back the drapes and
text: glancing out.
dialog: 10.
text: A white van is parked at an odd angle across the street,
text: the back door open.
scene_heading: EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: POV from inside the van: WE SEE the bit of curtain move.
text: CLICK: Suddenly it's the same view IN INFRARED, Frank's
text: heat signature clear as day.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank catches a glint of light from the van.
text: Exploding into motion, he drops the phone and runs all
text: out down the hall as...
text: PFFT! PFFT! PFFT! Three 40mm grenades are launched
dialog: into the house and...
text: BOOM! A fireball roars down the hall as...
text: Frank SMASHES through a second floor window...
scene_heading: EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: .. hits the roof, and spills into the yard in a shower of
dialog: glass.
scene_heading: EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Stepping from the back of the van, a FOURTH COMMANDO slings
text: his six-round grenade launcher and raises binoculars,
text: surveying the destruction.
text: Catching a glimpse of motion he lowers the lenses...
text: ...Frank is twenty feet away, charging straight at him...
text: The commando scrambles for his sidearm but... WHAM!
text: ...-he's tackled straight back into the van.
text: The rear doors are pulled closed, the engine starts, and
text: the van pulls out, disappearing in to the night.

speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Aren't you going to invite me in?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sorry Fred. Say hi to your mom
dialog: for me.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kicking off her shoes, Sarah slides out of her dress and
text: pulls on an oversized shirt already laid out on a chair
text: beside Love's Savage Secret.
text: Settling in, she cracks the book, but then thinks again
text: and gets up.
text: Walking into the kitchen, she grabs a glass, ice, and a
text: pour of bourbon. Then she shakes her head...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Fred.
text: ...and pours a little more.
text: Heading back to her book, she passes Frank.
text: Shrieking, she jumps, the glass smashing on the floor.
text: Sarah grabs a vase to defend herself as Frank puts up his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey! Hey! It's Frank Moses.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Stay back!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You eat Tasty Cakes for lunch and
dialog: your mom thinks you're gay.
text: She stares, worlds colliding, her fear turning to anger.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: She protectively pulls down her shirt to cover more of
text: herself, backing away.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
text: Frank steps forward, hands still up.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You have to get out of the house.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's not safe here. It's my fault
dialog: and I'll explain, but right now, I
dialog: need you to come with me.
text: She stares at him nervously.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I think you'd better leave.
text: He picks up a small suitcase from the floor.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: That's my bag.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I packed for you.
text: She looks around, reeling.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Did you... do my dishes?
text: Frank's clearly guilty.
text: Pulling it together, she puts on an authoritative tone.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Frank. I always liked you. But
dialog: I'm not about to...
text: Sarah freezes in fear as he draws his .45.
text: But he's staring past her out the window, where a car
text: pulls up across the street.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Right now, out the back.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm not going anywhere!
text: Frank's torn, feeling the seconds ticking by, not sure
dialog: how to handle this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I was never a diplomat. I was in
text: the CIA, and someone is trying to
dialog: kill me. That means there's been
dialog: surveillance. They've listened to
dialog: our phone calls and they're going
dialog: to come after you as leverage.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm calling the police.
text: The car doors open and three men get out, crossing the
text: street toward Sarah's.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT
text: Frank's behind the wheel with Sarah's purse on his lap,
text: going through it as he smoothly drives, tossing a nail
text: file and her can of pepper spray out the window.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This couldn't be more different
dialog: from how I hoped to meet you, you
dialog: know, if we ever even did meet.
text: He comes up with her cell phone and tosses it out too.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: But things happen and I think it's
dialog: important to be flexible.
text: He pauses, taking a breath, knowing it's not going well,
dialog: but really trying.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: You know what I mean?
text: Frank glances back for reassurance.
text: REVEAL Sarah, tied and gagged in the back seat, staring

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You want some water?

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm not kidnapping you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What do you think you just did!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You were in danger.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No I wasn't! Even if you aren't

dialog: me.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They know I call you. They've
dialog: listened.
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: ; FRANK

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't know how these guys found
dialog: me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I have to see someone. I need you
dialog: to stay here until I get back.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You just want me to sit here?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You'll be perfectly safe. No one
dialog: knows where you are.
text: He picks up the tape and tears off a fresh piece. She

speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: I'll be back soon.

speaker_heading: SARAH

text: Joe coldly eyes them in the mirror, slipping the paper

text: She nods, unnerved by his intensity.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What happens now?
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I told you: he sectioned out.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How am I supposed to know what
dialog: that means?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Trust me, Marvin's the guy you
dialog: want watching your back when
dialog: everything goes to hell.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: He said he tried to kill you!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I always felt bad about that.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He thought he was the subject of a
dialog: secret government mind control
dialog: experiment. I told him he was
dialog: nuts. He thought I was in on it
dialog: and tried to kill me.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, but later I found out they
dialog: were actually dosing him with LSD
dialog: for a decade.
text: Marvin walks back in with a stack of papers,
dialog: Sarah.
speaker_heading: MARVIN

speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0.) (cont'd)

text: They exchange a concerned look.
text: Stepping over bodies, they approach Special Forces CAPTAIN
text: McGINTY waiting for them beside a CIVILIAN, 30s, who
text: incongruously wears a short-sleeved button-down.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What the hell happened here?
text: But the civilian steps in front of him.
speaker_heading: CIVILIAN
dialog: Your orders are to make this

scene_heading: INT. BUNKER - LIVING ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You think everyone on this list

text: Marvin shrugs, flipping through military records.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Even if there was some massacre,

speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: You sure it's the CIA?

dialog: Frank and

text: watching Sarah talk on a pay phone across the street.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: What if they've tapped every data
dialog: source that exists on this Loeb
dialog: guy and are backtracing every
dialog: connection that comes in on those
dialog: sources and somehow filter those
dialog: millions of calls and know it's us
dialog: and then tag us with a chemical
dialog: marker, or put a satellite on us,
dialog: or fry us with Y-rays?
text: Frank thinks it over.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Even for you that's pretty paranoid.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I guess.
text: Marvin glances up at the sky, then pulls out a tattered
text: napkin and makes some urgent notes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: Nothing.
text: Sarah hangs up and heads over.
speaker_heading: MARVIN (cont'd)
dialog: What's with the girl, anyway?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I like her.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: No seriously. What's the angle?
text: Frank lets it go as Sarah walks up.
speaker_heading: SARAH

dialog: WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?
speaker_heading: BUSINESSWOMAN
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: Coldwell Banker! I'ma real estate

dialog: don't hurt me!
text: Furious at the lie, Marvin cocks the pistol, putting it
text: to her eye, sending the woman erupting into tears as Frank
text: and Sarah burst around the corner.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Marvin! What are you...
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: SHE'S ONE OF THEM!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: One of who?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
text: SHE WAS FOLLOWING US, MAN! She's

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: No... please...
text: Marvin holds up his left hand to block the splatter...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Frank!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just hold on!
text: He grabs the woman's purse and dumps the contents onto
text: the ground: there's a wallet, cosmetics, a cell phone.
text: Frank rips the purse apart: there's nothing.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Where's the camera, Marvin?
text: Marvin hesitates, suddenly unsure.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: She was... following us.
text: Frank pushes down the barrel of Marvin's gun and snaps
text: the woman's cell phone in half.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to the woman)
dialog: Go.
text: She runs off. Frank gives Marvin a hard look.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)

scene_heading: EXT. AIR CARGO TERMINAL - DAY

text: Sarah's quiet. Angry.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Are you upset?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: "She's got a camera hidden in her

dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Everyone makes mistakes.
text: He stands, cutting off Sarah's retort as three PILOTS
text: enter the terminal.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: Gabriel Loeb?
text: The oldest pilot looks over. He's Frank's age with that
text: classic ex-military look: tight haircut, thin, good shape.
text: The other two pilots pause as well, but Gabriel nods to
dialog: them to go on ahead.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: You have a minute?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: (Texas twang)
dialog: What's this about?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Afghanistan. 1981. Near Ghazni.
text: There's a tense beat.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I can't talk to you.
text: He pushes past, but Marvin steps in front of him.

text: Gabriel smiles.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL (cont'd)
dialog: Pair beats ace.
scene_heading: INT. AIR CARGO OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Nothing! I didn't tell her a damned
dialog: thing!
text: Frank looks at him coldly.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: She's dead. And everyone on her
dialog: list is dead except for you, me,

dialog: everyone who was there.
text: Gabriel's stunned.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Oh Christ.
text: Frank stares at him realizing...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know why...
text: Gabriel sits down heavily, unable to look at him.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: Tell me.
text: He glances up with fear and resignation.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: They had me fly this guy out there
text: from the gulf. Middle of the night.
text: Hairy little airstrip in the middle
text: of nowhere. He picked up a package
dialog: and we flew back out.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Who was the guy?
text: Over by the windows, Marvin starts MUTTERING as he fidgets
text: with his tattered napkin. Sarah glances over nervously.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
text: CIA. Dorky little spook in short
text: sleeves straight out of some office.
dialog: The whole thing was super hush hush.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What about the package?
speaker_heading: MARVIN (0.S.)
dialog: Frank! Frank! Frank
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: What?
dialog: 48.
text: Marvin runs over, pointing out the window.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: A helicopter!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We're at an airport for Christ's
dialog: sake.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Two four seven seven one. It's
dialog: following us. I write down all
dialog: the numbers, see?
text: Frank stares at Marvin, then looks at the tattered napkin,
text: filled with dozens of rows of tiny, smeared numbers.
text: He squints at the chopper then back at the napkin.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's a four.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: It's a seven!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Who makes a seven like that?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Let me see it.
text: Suddenly the window SPIDERWEBS.
text: Sarah looks around, startled.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Whoa! What was...?
text: She realizes Frank, Marvin and Gabriel are on the floor.
text: Frank pulls her down as...
text: WHUMP! A bullet hits the wall where she was standing.
text: Gabriel lies motionless, blood on his shirt.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: Oh my God!

speaker_heading: MARVIN

text: They dive behind a dumpster, bullets SLAMMING all around.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSWOMAN (0.S.)
dialog: I'm going to fuck you up, old man!
text: Marvin gives Frank a look.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Can I kill her now?

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Move!

scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE ALLEY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (re: pifiata)
dialog: Give me the pig.
text: Sarah hands it over and... WHACK! Frank punches in the
text: side, pulling out extra magazines.
text: Marvin reaches in, coming up with a machine pistol.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Old man? I'm in my prime!
text: Frank scoffs.
text: Pissed, Marvin jacks a cartridge out of his gun, catches
text: it in the air and holds it out.
speaker_heading: MARVIN (cont'd)
dialog: Bet you can't take this bullet out
dialog: of my hand.
text: More bullets SLAM around them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not now, Marvin!
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Bet you can't.
text: Quick as a flash, Sarah grabs the bullet.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Can we go now!
text: Marvin is stunned.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: WAIT! I wasn't ready. Do it again.
text: Under a barrage of lead, Frank leans around the scissor

text: incoming fire.
text: Suddenly BLAM BLAM BLAM... bullets fly out of the wall,
text: beside them, just missing.
text: Stunned, Frank and Marvin FIRE BACK THROUGH THE WALL.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That's not good.
text: Frank grabs her, running all-out down the alley.
text: FFFSST! KABOOM! The scissor-lift explodes like a toy.

text: Reloading, the woman levels the launcher again at the
dialog: prone figures.
text: But suddenly Marvin steps from the burning debris, standing
text: his ground, facing her down like a gunfighter.
text: The woman's finger tightens on the trigger...
text: And in a single clean motion, Marvin raises his pistol
dialog: and fires.
text: KA-BOOOM! A massive explosion rocks the alley as his

text: As debris rains down on Frank and Sarah, a figure appears

speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Old man, my ass.

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: No way! Not them!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Who?
text: Marvin jumps out of the car. Resigned, Frank gets out.

speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Godless bastards!
text: He runs off down the street.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Marvin tends to be ruled by his

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You're not really going in there?

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Tell Ivan Siderov that Frank Moses

speaker_heading: IVAN

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: I miss the old days. We could

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK

text: A beat.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Have you tried gardening?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Didn't work out.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: I can't stand it either. If it's

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You try soapy water?
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Does that work?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So I hear.

speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
dialog: I told you everything was going to

text: She whips around as he appears from the shadows.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No you didn't! You said, "Hold

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I can't do this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just relax and smile. I'll get us

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm not a hacker.
speaker_heading: FRANK

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - DAY

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What makes you think the Russians

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Faith?

dialog: button.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Actually it's more like hope.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH-SECURITY ELEVATOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

dialog: 61.
text: Frank bends close and she puts the contact...
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No.
text: He pulls out a matt knife and cuts a hole in the drywall
text: beside the door, then reaches in and opens the handle.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: God love forced low-bid government
dialog: contracts.
text: He tapes a single sheet of paper over the hole in the

scene_heading: INT. SECURE SERVER - DAY

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Depending on what they charge you
dialog: with, either life in prison or death.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Awesome.
text: She brings up the profile for the killer dressed as a

speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: There.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Work the assignment tree back and

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Who is it?
text: Thomas looks from his screen in confusion...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: It's internal. Directorate on five.

speaker_heading: COOPER

text: Frank looks at Cooper across the room, still on the phone.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You.
text: Cooper stares. He almost laughs.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Unbelievable.
text: Frank closes in on him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What did they pull out of
dialog: Afghanistan?
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: You think you can just walk in
dialog: here and everyone'll just roll
dialog: over?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Actually, I figured I'd have to
dialog: beat it out of some snot-nosed
dialog: button-pusher.
text: Frank swings on him, but Cooper blocks and counters.
text: In a flurry of fists, Frank is hit once and then again.
text: Face bloodied, he stumbles back, stunned. Cooper smiles.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Not quite as fast as you once were?
text: Frank spits blood.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Kordesky trained you?
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 65.
text: Cooper closes again, attacks, blocks, and delivers two
text: more brutal body-blows...
text: ...but suddenly Frank spins around him, catching an arm
text: and slamming Cooper onto a desk, pinned.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I taught Kordesky.
text: Frank brutally twists his arm, tighter.
speaker_heading: COOPER
speaker_heading: AAAAGH!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Who ordered these hits?

speaker_heading: COOPER

text: CRACK! Frank breaks his arm.
speaker_heading: COOPER (cont'd)
speaker_heading: AAAAAAAAAGH !
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You come after one of your own and
dialog: you don't even ask why?
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: It doesn't come to me unless it's
dialog: been vetted all the way up the
dialog: line. There's not a doubt in my
dialog: mind you've earned what you've got
dialog: coming.
text: Frank grabs his chin, cranking his neck to the edge of
dialog: breaking.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The minute you learned who I was
dialog: you should have walked away.
text: Gasping, Cooper wrenches out a reply.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Would you?
text: Suddenly wrenching to his left, Cooper slides off the
text: desk, hitting the floor, catching Frank by surprise with
text: a kick, knocking him down.
text: Jumping up, Cooper grabs a phone with his good arm,
text: clobbering Frank...
dialog: 66.
text: ...but Frank kicks him, catching Cooper in the gut, sending
text: him flying backwards through the glass wall of his office.
text: Frank's up in a second, but Cooper's in his desk, coming
text: up with a gun.
text: Frank ducks, running for the door as Cooper UNLOADS.
text: Rounds chew up the wall behind him...
text: then slam into him, spilling Frank out the door.
text: Cooper races after, bursting into the hall...
text: But it's empty except for a spatter of blood.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Frank's hit in the shoulder and the side, in pain, forcing
text: himself down the stairs.
text: Stepping into the 4th floor hall, he pulls the first fire

text: As ALARMS RING, he presses forward through the rapidly
text: filling corridor and catches a woman by the arm:
speaker_heading: FRANK

text: Rounding a corner, they are suddenly right in front of
text: Frank standing beside a Halon canister with a fire axe.
text: Frank takes a deep breath and swings, snapping the valve.
text: PRESSURIZED GAS ERUPTS and suddenly Sarah and her escorts
text: are writhing on the ground gasping for air that doesn't
text: seem to be there.
text: Frank wades in, cuts Sarah's zip cuffs and picks her up.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - DAY
text: Frank drags Sarah up the stairs.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Breathe out then in. You're fine.
dialog: Just breathe.
text: Gasping, she follows his directions, gaining control.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You're bleeding!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Do you have the download?
text: She pulls a memory stick from her bra.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: They emerge into the open hall overlooking the four story

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What are we going to do?
text: Frank leads her forward to where he's stashed a second
text: canister of Halon.
speaker_heading: SARAH (cont'd)
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: It binds up oxygen in the air.
text: Kicking it over he gets it rolling and...
text: SMASH! The canister breaks through the glass panel under
text: the railing, falls three stories and...
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: POOF !

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Sir...
scene_heading: DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: VICTORIA

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: The relationship wasn't sanctioned.

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You give yourself up. I'1l take

text: Frank smiles grimly.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sure I will. Even if you brought

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If you actually believe that, you're

speaker_heading: COOPER (cont'd)

speaker_heading: COOPER (cont'd)

speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Does anyone want to discuss the

speaker_heading: MARVIN

speaker_heading: VICTORIA

speaker_heading: IVAN

speaker_heading: IVAN (cont'd)

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: COOPER (cont'd)

speaker_heading: COOPER (cont'd)

speaker_heading: COOPER

speaker_heading: COOPER

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I have visual contact. Front of

scene_heading: EXT. THE ALLERTON HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Bursting from the hotel, Cooper races down the steps, gun

text: Jackson and Thomas run after their boss, closing the gap
text: until they reach him at the corner where the figure was.
text: Cooper's looking around wildly, but there's no one there,
text: no one retreating, nothing.
text: Except... on a window ledge where Frank was standing,

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Back inside! Now!
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Moves like that could get you

speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Oh. Yes. Of course.
text: He takes it, kisses her hand, and melts into the crowd.
text: Victoria sits, flushed, and for the first time we've seen
dialog: her, not totally cool.
speaker_heading: IVAN

text: his side, covertly spraying a PUFF here and there.
text: People begins to SNIFF and a low murmur rises.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA

speaker_heading: VICTORIA

speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I'm sure I'm allowed.
speaker_heading: LONE AGENT
dialog: Ma'am. Stop. This area is off
dialog: limits!
text: She continues forward, completely unfazed as the agent
text: draws his weapon.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (amused )
dialog: Put that away. Do you know who I
dialog: am?
speaker_heading: LONE AGENT
dialog: Stop or I will be forced to treat
dialog: you as a threat.
text: She smiles even wider.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Look at this dress. Where, exactly,
dialog: is the threat?
text: The agent looks her over as she puts up her hands and
text: closes the rest of the distance and...
text: WHAM: the gun is twisted out of his hand as he takes a
text: chop to the side of the neck and goes down.
text: Victoria takes a moment to fix her boobs as Marvin enters
text: the hall with two duffel bags.
text: They step into the elevator, she inserts a fireman's key,
dialog: and hits G.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Burbacher's point men burst out of the stairwell, covering
text: the garage and pulling open the doors of the waiting car.
text: Burbacher and close security pile the VP into the car and
text: it peels out, rounding a corner and...
dialog: 108.
text: Is ripped apart by automatic fire, heavy rounds pulverizing
text: the front of the car, sending it smashing into a wall.
text: Screaming commands, Burbacher forces the VP out, using

scene_heading: POINT MAN AGENT

speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: 109.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: SOOTHING MUSIC plays in the background.
text: AS Ivan descends, he begins to hum the RUSSIAN NATIONAL
text: ANTHEM, quietly at first, then louder and more
text: enthusiastically, conducting with his drink until...
text: DING: the doors roll open onto chaos:
scene_heading: INSERT - GARAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: ...where a huge fire-fight is unfolding: the Secret Service
text: team pinned down as another ARMORED LIMO moves in to get
dialog: them cover.
text: Culminating the anthem, Ivan pulls a remote from his jacket
text: and presses the button: a huge explosion rips out the
text: front end of the back-up limo.
scene_heading: RETURN TO SCENE
text: The elevator doors roll back closed on the DEAFENING
text: ACTION, and Ivan leans back, sips his drink, and listens
text: to the SOOTHING MUSIC once again.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: As smoke from the limo explosion fills the air, Burbacher

text: Workers duck as the team crosses the room.
text: But Burbacher sees something, shoving the VP down...
text: ...as AUTOMATIC FIRE rakes the counter.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MARVIN AND VICTORIA
text: In a side corridor. She empties the magazine and he hands
text: her another as they watch kitchen workers scatter and the
text: Secret Service return fire.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I remember the Secret Service being
dialog: tougher.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Me too.
text: But suddenly they're taking fire from behind, bullets
text: SLAPPING in to the wall around them.
text: Marvin ducks, drawing a machine pistol and spraying the
dialog: corridor.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I think it's SWAT.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (0.S.)
dialog: We have a problem, Marvin.
text: He looks over.
text: Victoria's on the floor, her dress awash in blood from a

text: Marvin's instantly in motion, delving into a duffel bag,
text: pulling cans of smoke, yanking pins, tossing them out.
dialog: 111.
text: With smoke adding a new layer of confusion to the SHOUTING
text: and GUNFIRE, he picks up Victoria, heading up a different
dialog: corridor.
text: He hustles forward as fast as he can, but the SOUNDS OF
text: PURSUIT rise behind him.
text: Marvin fires back down the hall, then pulls open a door
text: revealing a utility closet and leans her inside.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (cont'd)
dialog: What the hell?
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: No choice.
text: She look at him, realizing he's right.
text: Stripping off his jacket, he puts it around Victoria.
text: Stepping back REVEALS he's wearing a vest, covered in
dialog: plastic explosives.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Good luck.
text: He gives her a wink.
speaker_heading: MARVIN

scene_heading: AGENT BURBACHER

scene_heading: INT. SUB LEVEL ONE - HALL - NIGHT
text: Victoria makes her way forward, weak but deliberate, her

text: Rounding a corner she finds herself at a steel security
text: gate pulled across the concrete corridor.
text: SHOUTS and FOOTSTEPS rise behind her.

speaker_heading: IVAN (0.S.)
dialog: Perhaps I can be of some assistance?

scene_heading: AGENT BURBACHER
dialog: I don't know yet, sir.

dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: OTHER AGENT
text: Looks clear.
speaker_heading: DRIVER (0.S.)
dialog: Copy that.
text: THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES FORWARD to REVEAL that FRANK is
dialog: the driver.

scene_heading: AGENT BURBACHER
dialog: Why are we stopping?

dialog: Stanton senses this is bad.
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
dialog: I'm sure we can negotiate
dialog: something...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So now it's coming back to you?
text: Stanton pipes down.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: Or have there been so many that

dialog: you don't even think about it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I was prepared to live my life in
dialog: peace. You couldn't even let me

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Afghanistan. I was there.

scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
dialog: Can we talk about this?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You can talk all you want.

dialog: there.
text: Frank unholsters his old .45 and crouches down to look
text: the VP in the eye.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's not that I want revenge. I
dialog: don't care about you. But there
dialog: are rules about how you treat your
dialog: tools. The people who do things
dialog: for you do it because they believe
dialog: in the greater good.
text: Frank holds up his set of dog tags. Now we see that the
dialog: name and number have been filed out.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: I joined up when I was seventeen
dialog: and took an oath to defend this
dialog: country. They stamped these tags
dialog: with the name my mother gave me.
dialog: Later the Company erased that name
dialog: forever. These are a symbol of
dialog: that sacrifice.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I guess I'm okay with that.
text: He starts to move, but Cooper pulls Sarah from the car,
text: covering her with his weapon.
text: She and Frank lock eyes. So close but so far.
dialog: 117.
text: He looks between her and the VP.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I love you too.
text: Frank looks at Cooper.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: She goes free.
text: Cooper nods.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: Swear it on your family's life.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I do.
text: Sarah looks between them, horrified.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No...
text: Frank slowly lowers his .45.
text: It CLATTERS to the ground.
text: Jackson and Thomas move in on him, guns ready.
text: Frank puts his hands above his head, and as the chopper
text: lands, kicking up dust over the scene, his eyes never
text: leave Sarah's as he's cuffed.
text: Stevens gets out of the chopper.
text: Approaching Cooper, he eyes Frank and the VP.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
dialog: That's him?
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: That's him.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
dialog: Good work.
text: Cooper gives him a nod.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Yes sir.
text: The VP approaches Stevens, still shaking, furious...
dialog: 118.
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
dialog: What the hell have you done? I
dialog: asked you to find out who knew
dialog: about Afghanistan to see if we
dialog: could control the story.
text: Frank watches this, trying to figure it out.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
dialog: Which is exactly what I did. I
dialog: protected this administration and
dialog: made this campaign possible. With
dialog: the stroke of a pen, I gave you a
text: shot at the presidency.
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
dialog: You had people killed!
scene_heading: DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
dialog: No one who mattered.
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
dialog: Americans!
scene_heading: DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
dialog: Nobody cares!
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
dialog: This isn't what I wanted!
text: Stevens smiles coldly.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
dialog: These aren't details you need to
dialog: be concerned about. All you need
dialog: to remember is that you owe me.
text: The VP starts towards him.
scene_heading: VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
dialog: Is that why you did this?
text: Cooper steps between them, stopping the VP.
text: He nods to Jackson and Thomas.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Escort the Vice President to the
text: chopper.
text: They pull him away, leaving Cooper and Stevens alone with
dialog: Frank and Sarah.
text: Cooper takes out a syringe.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No!
dialog: 119.
text: Cooper steps to Frank who stares him down, unflinching.
text: Lashing out, Cooper jabs it into Stevens' neck.
text: He gasps, eyes bugging.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You disgust me.
text: Clutching his chest, Stevens collapses to the ground.
text: Sarah looks away. But Frank's eyes never leave Cooper.
text: Uncuffing Frank, Cooper holds out his .45.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe there's some hope for the
dialog: Company after all.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Maybe.
text: Frank takes the gun.
text: Sarah leaps into Frank's arms and they embrace.
speaker_heading: COOPER (cont'd)
dialog: I want you to come back home.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Home?
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: A chance to work again. To train
dialog: the next generation.
text: Frank considers, then tosses Cooper his tags and takes
text: Sarah's hand.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm retired.
text: Cooper watches them walk away.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Where are you going to go, Frank?
dialog: What else do you have?
text: But suddenly a figure steps out of the darkness to meet
text: Frank: Marvin, carrying a RPG.
text: And then another figure emerges: Victoria, rifle slung.
text: A car starts in the darkness and pulls close: Ivan's behind
text: the wheel, still dressed in his tux.
text: Frank and Sarah embrace their friends.
dialog: 120.
text: Frank looks back at Cooper, then slips into the car and
text: is gone.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT
text: Frank and Sarah kiss...
text: And Ivan leans back, totally interrupting.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: So Frank. I was wondering if you
dialog: would go on little errand with me.
text: Victoria turns from the front passenger side.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: His timing is terrible.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Is just a tiny little nuclear
dialog: problem in Moldova. A day or two,
dialog: no big thing. Sarah, you will
dialog: love the countryside.
text: Frank looks at him, stunned.
text: Marvin, squeezed in next to him, elbows him in the side.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Come on, man, it's just the safety
dialog: of the world.
dialog: Frank's about to answer and we...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
dialog:
