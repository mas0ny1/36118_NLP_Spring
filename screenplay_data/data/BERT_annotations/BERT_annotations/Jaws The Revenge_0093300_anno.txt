scene_heading: TITLE SEQUENCE: UNDER WATER - NIGHT
text: As titles and music play, we move
text: slowly beneath the water off the
dialog: coast of Amity.
text: We swim beneath a dock, threading
dialog: our way through pilings...
text: We move through the water, swimming,
dialog: just swimming, with all the time in
dialog: the world.
dialog: We move over some junk -- the
text: rusting front end of an automobile...
dialog: We're going somewhere...
dialog: The water becomes shallow and we
text: stop. Up through the surface, the
text: images distorted, we see the lights
dialog: of a town...Amity...
text: We move on, swimming again, just
text: swimming, moving through the water
text: until, suddenly, the water swirls
text: with motion around us. We experience
text: the sensation of turning and then
dialog: we see it, THE EYE...And, for a
dialog: moment, we think we're going to
dialog: see more...
dialog: But all we see, as titles end, is
text: THE EYE...
speaker_heading: JAWS:
speaker_heading: THE REVENGE
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: 1	AN ENORMOUS BLACK EYE
dialog: 1
text: casts its deadly stare straight at us. Waves of heat, like
text: ocean currents, rise up around it. A sound like that of
text: the fires of hell fills our ears.
speaker_heading: ELLEN (O.S.)
dialog: Stop that....
speaker_heading: SEAN (O.S.)
dialog: Stop what?
speaker_heading: ELLEN (O.S.)
dialog: That....
speaker_heading: SEAN (O.S.)
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I'm not doing anything.
text: A hand is heard being slapped lightly.
speaker_heading: SEAN (O.S.)
dialog: (feigning
dialog: pain)
dialog: That hurt....
speaker_heading: ELLEN (O.S.)
dialog: Serves you right.
dialog: (laughing
dialog: despite
dialog: herself)
dialog: Will you please stop....
speaker_heading: SEAN (O.S.)
dialog: Can't help myself....
text: The huge eye rises up toward us, then turns away and
text: disappears, to be replaced by another just like it.
scene_heading: 2	INT. BRODY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 2
text: The eye belongs to a fish and the fish is frying in a pan
text: and Ellen has just turned it. She glances at Sean, her
text: son, who's dressed in an Amity police uniform. He's
text: munching a piece of lettuce from the salad, which he's been
text: picking at. It's winter and she's wearing a bit of wool.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You're almost as fast as your
dialog: father. He could snatch a tomato
dialog: out of a salad faster that a rabbit
dialog: makes love.
text: Sean grins at his mother and slowly tries to take more
text: lettuce without being seen.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I see what you're doing....
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I'm hungry, Mom....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Let me finish dinner before you eat
dialog: it...Chop the peppers....
text: He lines up a red and green pepper and eyes them sympatha-
dialog: tically.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Sorry fellas....
text: He starts chopping them up and Ellen grabs her glass of wine
text: and sits herself on a stool to watch him. Showing off a
text: little, he starts adding some professional panache to his
text: chopping.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Watch your fingers....
text: He cuts himself.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Shit....
text: The phone rings.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Adds flavor....
text: He sucks at his finger as she answers the phone on its
dialog: second ring.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We don't want any....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (picking up
dialog: the phone)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (smile
text: broadens as
dialog: she listens)
dialog: Thea who?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I know it's Thea Brody. How many
dialog: grandchildren do I have? I know you
dialog: can use the phone by yourself.
dialog: You're a big girl. I know you're
dialog: five.
text: Sean, still sucking at his finger, eager to talk with his
text: niece, moves to the phone and leans in close to the
text: mouthpiece.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hi ya, kiddo. How you doing down
dialog: there in the sunshine?
text: Ellen shares the mouthpiece with her son.
speaker_heading: THEA (O.S.)
dialog: I'm fine, Uncle Sean. I went swimming
dialog: today. I'm taking lessons.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
text: She already swims like a fish.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hey, Michael!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, bro....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (to Sean)
dialog: The fish. Check it....
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You check it....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'm on the phone....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: I'm paying for the call....
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (to Ellen)
dialog: Not if you let me have it.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: In a minute....
speaker_heading: THEA (O.S.)
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (to Thea)
dialog: Your grandmother's a slave driver.
dialog: Tell her to be nice to me.
text: Sean makes a face at his mother, who smiles at him, then
text: continues her conversation with Thea.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Did you get the book I sent you?
dialog: (listens)
text: Sean studies the fish as it fries in the pan, not sure
dialog: what to do with it.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Ask the big doctor about his work.
dialog: (yelling so
dialog: Michael can
dialog: hear him)
dialog: Tough life you Bahamian beach bum...
dialog: Playing in the water all day....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: He heard that.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Good.
text: He turns to the fish.
speaker_heading: 3	OMITTED
dialog: 3
scene_heading: 4	AMITY - DUSK
dialog: 4
text: It's the next day and the main business street of Amity
text: is ablaze with Christmas lights and decorations. The
text: streets are busier than usual with traffic. People move
dialog: about with that extra sense of purpose and good cheer
text: which accompanies the holiday season.
text: Sean, Ellen and Tiffany, the young woman to whom Sean is
text: engaged, are just leaving Ellen's real estate office, a
text: storefront on the main street. They're carrying Christmas
text: packages. Ellen's partner, Agnes Taft, is seen at her desk
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (as she leaves)
dialog: Tomorrow we have to get the ads for
dialog: the paper straightened out. And if
dialog: Mrs. Blodget calls, tell her we'll
dialog: have the final offer tomorrow....
speaker_heading: MRS. TAFT
dialog: How come you get to leave early?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (smiling)
text: My desk is closer to the door....
text: Mrs. Taft grins and goes back to work as Ellen, Sean and
text: Tiffany start across the street. The sign above the door
text: behind them reads: 'BRODY AND TAFT, REAL ESTATE.'
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (continuing
dialog: their earlier
dialog: conversation)
dialog: A big one....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: A small one...Your brother won't be
dialog: here....
text: The Mayor sees them as he moves along the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: THE MAYOR
dialog: Merry Christmas.
scene_heading: ELLEN			 SEAN/TIFFANY
dialog: Merry Christmas, Jim....	Merry Christmas, Mayor....
speaker_heading: THE MAYOR
text: Eggnog time...Thursday night.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'll be there....
text: The Mayor offers a large grin and hurries on.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (to Ellen)
dialog: We're having a big tree and we're
dialog: getting out all the old ornaments
dialog: and we're going to do it right....
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: We'll put stockings on the mantel....
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: And we're putting out a sandwich and
dialog: a bottle of beer for Santa....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: All right...We'll do it all...Tiffany,
dialog: you have no idea what kind of mad man
dialog: you're marrying....
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: (smiling at
dialog: Sean)
dialog: Oh, yes I do....
text: They approach the front of the police station.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I've got to check in....
text: He kisses his mother on the cheek and plants one on
text: Tiffany's lips.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Don't be late.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I won't....
text: Sean heads for the station. The two women watch him for a
dialog: moment, then move on.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (with good
dialog: humor)
dialog: He has the messiest room in America....
speaker_heading: TIFFANY
dialog: I know...but he's all mine....
text: Ellen gives her a look, then smiles and the two women
dialog: continue on.
scene_heading: 5	INT. POLICE STATION - DUSK
dialog: 5
text: Sean moves into the front office, taking off his gloves
text: and blowing into his hands. The secretary, Polly, who is
text: close to retirement, is going through a filing cabinet.
text: There's a framed picture of Martin Brody on the wall near
text: her. It has a plaque beneath it which reads, MARTIN BRODY,
text: POLICE CHIEF, 1973-1985. She slams the drawer shut in her
text: frustration at not being able to find what she's looking
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: That bad, huh?
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: We're out of decaf...We're out of
dialog: petty cash...And we're out of
dialog: requisition forms....
text: He smiles sympathetically and pours himself a half cup of
text: coffee and waits for the rest of it.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You have the safety talk at school,
dialog: one o'clock tomorrow....
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Anything to do before I go home?
text: He sips at his coffee, eager to be gone. Polly opens
text: another file and searches.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: That man keeps calling about his
dialog: training film. I can't convince him
dialog: we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Good night, Polly....
text: He takes a final sip of coffee and puts the mug down and
text: heads for the door. The phone rings. Polly moves to her
dialog: desk.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: George called about the softball
dialog: league. He wants you to organize a
dialog: team for next summer....
text: He disappears as she picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Amity Police Department...
dialog: (listens;
dialog: then yells
dialog: at Sean)
text: Hold it! There's an old dock piling
text: drifting in the channel.
text: Sean reappears in the doorway looking quizzical.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (continuing;
dialog: on the phone)
dialog: Maybe it will just keep drifting
text: until it goes away.
dialog: (to Sean)
text: It's stuck against a channel marker.
text: He starts away again, trying to ignore it.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (continuing;
dialog: listening;
dialog: then yelling)
dialog: Hold it again! Coast Guard's busy
dialog: and it has to be cleared before the
text: fishermen come back.
text: Sean moves back to the doorway.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Where's Lenny?
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (hand over
dialog: the mouthpiece)
text: Gone to Ben Masters' place. Cow
text: tipping.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Cow tipping?
speaker_heading: POLLY
text: Claims kids come around at night and
text: tip over his sleeping cows. They're
dialog: not giving milk.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: I'll take care of it.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (on the
dialog: phone)
dialog: Deputy Brody will take care of it
dialog: personally.
text: She hangs up and eyes Sean, who's still framed in the doorway.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Call my mother. Tell her I'll be
dialog: late.
text: He shakes his head and disappears at the door.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Cow tipping....
text: 6	THE DOCKS - DUSK TO NIGHT
dialog: 6
text: A huge banner is stretched above the docks. It reads:
scene_heading: AMITY ANNUAL CHRISTMAS PAGEANT.
text: The combined forces of the high school band, chorus and
text: dramatic society are in the process of rehearsing their
text: musical version of the birth of Christ. Their director,
text: Mr. Tarkanian, is jumping about, trying to organize things.
speaker_heading: TARKANIAN
dialog: Come on people. Come on. We go on
dialog: at eight o'clock tomorrow night
dialog: and...
dialog: (voice rising
dialog: to a scream)
dialog: No one's ready....
text: This gets him some attention and his kids begin taking
dialog: their places -- Mary and Joseph, the Three Wisemen, the
text: shepherds...the sheep, the camel, which is a horse with an
text: artificial hump.
speaker_heading: TARKANIAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You shepherds, find your places.
dialog: And don't forget the sheep....
text: Sean pulls up in the police vehicle, gets out and, grinning
text: and shaking his head at the confusion, begins to make his
text: way through it.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (yelling at
dialog: Tarkanian)
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: TARKANIAN
dialog: I'll need it with this bunch....
text: Sean pushes on, moving out on the dock.
speaker_heading: TARKANIAN (O.S.)
dialog: Where's the Frankincense? This is
dialog: supposed to be a dress rehearsal....
scene_heading: 7	THE POLICE BOAT - NIGHT
dialog: 7
text: Sean gets the engine started and casts off and the small
text: boat makes its way from the dock.
speaker_heading: TARKANIAN (O.S.)
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: You're supposed to be in costume,
dialog: Joseph. Where's your robe? Jesus!
speaker_heading: A KID (O.S.)
dialog: Here I am....
scene_heading: 8	THE BAY - NIGHT
dialog: 8
text: The boat moves slowly toward the channel. Sean looks
text: back and sees the lights and activity on the dock and
text: smiles a little, then turns his attention to the job at
text: hand, switching on the boat's spotlight, using it to cut
text: through the accumulating darkness.
scene_heading: 9	THE CHANNEL - NIGHT
dialog: 9
text: Sean brings the boat to the channel marker, with its small
text: blinking red light, and kills the engine and examines the
text: huge piece of dock piling, most of which is beneath the sur-
text: face. It's lodged against the marker, so heavy in the water
text: that it's not moving an inch. Hardly more than a shadow,
text: his face just barely illuminated by the occasional dull red
text: light, Sean gathers the towline and begins trying to secure
text: it to the piling, a difficult job in the cold, which
text: requires him to lean out over the side as far as he can.
text: The band is heard starting up on the dock, gradually col-
text: lecting itself until it sounds like one, playing "The First
text: Noel." A few moments later, the choir begins singing it.
text: Suddenly the water explodes up around him violently and the
text: boat rocks in the shock of it and a dark form is seen, for
text: an instant, and Sean disappears from our view. The boat's
text: spotlight rocks crazily. Then the turmoil of the water dies
text: and all is calm and the singing from the dock is heard
text: clearly again.
text: Sean, holding onto his shredded sleeve and coat, bleeding
text: profusely, has fallen to a corner of the stern. He looks
text: off toward the dock and opens his mouth to call for help,
text: but nothing comes out. The music grows louder as the band
text: and chorus find their confidence.
text: Then a tremendous surge of water explodes upward and the
text: dark form is seen again, for an instant, and our view of
text: Sean is lost. When we can see again, Sean and a corner
text: of the stern are gone.
text: For a moment, Sean is seen holding onto the piece of dock
text: piling with his remaining arm. He cries out for help but
text: it's lost in the swelling sound of the Christmas Carol
text: coming from the dock. Then Sean and the pole disappear
text: beneath the surface. He's just gone. A few moments later,
text: the pole pops back to the surface. In the rocking
text: spotlight from the boat, the clear outline of the shark's
text: jaws can be seen where it's taken a chunk of it. In the
text: stillness of the night, the band and chorus suddenly stop.
speaker_heading: TARKANIAN (O.S.)
dialog: (yelling; his
dialog: patience
dialog: exhausted)
dialog: Get the star higher. Higher! And
dialog: where the hell are the Wisemen?
scene_heading: 10	INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
dialog: 10
text: Ellen in shock, moves down a corridor with Lenny, Sean's
text: boss, the Chief. He holds her arm as they move to a back
text: room of the station. Polly and a handful of townspeople
text: watch sadly from the other end.
speaker_heading: LENNY
dialog: If I didn't have to, I wouldn't.
dialog: (hates this
dialog: conversation)
dialog: There's not enough...Law requires a
dialog: positive identification and there's
dialog: not...
dialog: (can't finish)
text: He holds the door open and Ellen goes inside.
scene_heading: 11	THE BACK ROOM - DAY
dialog: 11
text: A sheet covers the table in the center of the room.
text: There's a slight bulge beneath it. Ellen moves to the
text: table. Lenny moves to get ahead of her.
speaker_heading: LENNY
dialog: I wish there was some way to make it
dialog: easy....
text: Ellen, still in shock, watches as Lenny pulls back the sheet.
text: She goes rigid, staring at Sean's remains without expression.
text: He glances at her, then puts the sheet back. She doesn't
text: move. He moves to an old desk which sits in a corner and
text: takes up a package. Sean's service revolver, in his holster,
text: and his badge are on top of it. He brings them to her.
speaker_heading: LENNY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: His things....
text: She looks dully at Lenny, then at the package, staring at
text: the service revolver.
speaker_heading: LENNY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I thought you'd want them....
text: She takes what he offers and leaves.
speaker_heading: 12	THE CORRIDOR
dialog: 12
text: Ellen stops and uses all her strength to compose herself.
text: Her expression is etched with controlled rage.
dialog: 13
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: and	OMITTED
dialog: and
dialog: 14
dialog: 14
scene_heading: 15	EXT. BRODY HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 15
text: A taxi pulls up in front and Michael Brody, in his late
text: twenties. Carla, his wife, mid-twenties, and Thea, their
text: five-year-old daughter, get out. As the driver gathers their
text: luggage, they look sadly at the house, then start for it.
text: Thea doesn't really understand what's going on.
scene_heading: 16	INT. HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 16
text: Michael and his family move into the house.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Mom?
text: There's no answer and he looks in the living room. It's
text: empty.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Anybody home?
text: Polly moves into the hall, followed by Mrs. Kintner, Agnes
text: Taft, and another woman. They all look as though they've
text: been working in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Michael....
text: He moves to her and they embrace. Polly looks at Carla and
text: the two women exchange sad smiles.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Where's Mom?
text: Polly points out toward the beach.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: She's been out there for hours....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How's she doing?
text: Polly gives him a look, as if to say, not very well.
scene_heading: MRS. KINTNER
dialog: We just came from Tiffany's house....
speaker_heading: MRS. TAFT
dialog: Poor girl...The doctor's had to sedate
dialog: her....
text: Michael nods and leaves. Polly smiles at Thea.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: I hardly recognize you, Thea. You're
dialog: so grown up....
speaker_heading: THEA
dialog: Uncle Sean is dead, you know.
dialog: (to Carla)
dialog: Will he ever come back?
speaker_heading: POLLY			 CARLA
dialog: (to Thea)			 (to Thea)
dialog: You want something to eat?	We'll talk about it some
dialog: more later.
speaker_heading: THEA
dialog: (to Polly)
dialog: I had a hamburger on the plane.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: We can do better than that.....
text: Polly offers her hand and Thea takes it and they head for
text: the kitchen. Polly and Carla exchanging the knowledge of how
dialog: difficult this all is for a child.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: How about a funny bone sandwich?
text: Thea giggles and they disappear into the kitchen.
scene_heading: 17	THE BEACH - DAY
dialog: 17
text: Ellen stands at the shoreline, looking out toward the bay,
text: her expression empty of feeling; stoic suppression of her
text: feelings. Michael moves down the beach toward her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Mom....
text: She turns and, for a long moment they look at each other,
text: then he moves to her and takes her in his arms. They hold
text: onto each other for a long time. Tears begin to well up in
text: his eyes. She looks at him, then kisses him gently, then
text: looks back out at the water.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (with deadly calm)
dialog: It came for him. It waited all this
dialog: time and it came for him....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Mother....
text: But she doesn't hear him. Her mind and heart are somewhere
dialog: else.
scene_heading: 18	INT. BRODY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 18
text: Carla is organizing the evening meal. Michael moves into
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: She's putting Thea to sleep.
text: He gets a can of beer from the refrigerator and pops the
text: top, then looks at it. She studies him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I bought him his first legal drink.
dialog: He got so pissed that night....
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: He told me you both did....
text: They look at each other, sharing their grief.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: He told me a lot about you two....
text: Carla catches Ellen entering from the corner of her eye.
text: Michael follows her gaze.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sit down, Ma....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You guys must be starving....
text: Ellen moves to the counter and starts pulling out pots and
text: pans, as though she's lost control of herself. Carla moves
dialog: to calm her down.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I'm making dinner. You should....
text: Ellen pulls herself free from Carla's hand and continues
text: pulling out the pots. She stops suddenly, holding one in
text: her hand. She lets it drop and turns to look at Michael.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I want you to get out of the water....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I want you to give up that terrible job.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (her voice
dialog: rising)
dialog: You're damn right I'm serious....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm just getting started....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I don't want you in the water anymore....
text: She stops suddenly, aware that Michael and Carla are
text: staring at her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Mom, you're upset. Sit down...Please....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I won't have anyone in my family any-
dialog: where near the water....
dialog: (coming
dialog: unglued)
dialog: Never again...Never....
text: Michael moves to her, trying to take her in his arms,
text: trying to comfort her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey, come on, you can't believe that
text: voodoo. Sharks don't commit murder.
dialog: They don't pick out a person....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (pulling away
dialog: from her son)
dialog: It picked Sean...It killed your
dialog: father....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Dad died from a heart attack....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: He died from fear...From having to
dialog: go out there after it....
text: She starts from the room unable to control herself, not
text: wanting to unravel completely in front of Michael and Carla.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (a last attempt
dialog: to reason with
dialog: her)
dialog: There's never been a great white
dialog: where we live. It's warm water...
dialog: They don't like it....
speaker_heading: ELLEN (O.S.)
dialog: (as she moves
dialog: away)
dialog: Your brother's dead...Your father's
dialog: dead....
text: Michael and Carla look at each other with grave concern.
scene_heading: 19	THE BEACH - DAY
dialog: 19
text: The sand is hard from the cold and it's empty of people.
text: The water is calm. The day is sunny and peaceful.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: He was such a good-natured kid...
dialog: Always going out of his way....
speaker_heading: CARLA (O.S.)
dialog: He was doing his job....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
text: It was a piece of wood. A shitty
dialog: piece of wood. It's not fair....
text: Michael and Carla move into view, their backs to us,
text: bundled against the cold.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: He was just doing his job, Michael.
text: They walk on in silence for a moment and we see them coming
text: toward us. Michael is deeply troubled. Carla is concerned
dialog: about him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: God, he could make me laugh sometimes.
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: He was always tagging after me when
dialog: we were kids. He wanted so much to
dialog: do what I was doing....
text: Suddenly Michael starts running. Carla watches him for a
text: moment, then starts running after him.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Nowhere....
text: He starts running flat out and Carla runs with him, stopping
text: finally because he's too fast and she can't keep pace. She
text: watches as he works every muscle in his body, trying to
text: exhaust himself, trying to rid himself of what he feels.
speaker_heading: 20	OMITTED
dialog: 20
scene_heading: 21	INT. BRODY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (FROM JAWS)
dialog: 21
text: Sean, a small boy, and Martin are at the table. Martin is
text: lost in thought, reflecting on his dilemma about the
text: appearance of a great white shark in Amity and the refusal
text: of the town fathers to shut down the beaches. Sean imitates
text: his father's every move, mimicking him in every way.
speaker_heading: MINISTER (V.O.)
dialog: To everything there is a season
dialog: And a time to every purpose under
dialog: the heaven;
dialog: A time to be born, and a time to
dialog: die....
scene_heading: 22	THE CEMETERY - DAY
dialog: 22
text: Ellen is smiling, her expression reflecting her memory of

text: clothes, thread their way through the throng, moving like
text: Salmon upstream against the flow of the mass of humanity
text: moving the other way. She's fascinated by the music and
text: noise and color of what's around her.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: A few more streets....
text: She casts a smile at him, then returns her attention to the
text: parade. Hoagie navigates them through the crowd.
scene_heading: 71	A STREET - DAY
dialog: 71
text: Hoagie leads Ellen up a street no wider than an alley. The
text: old houses seem to lean toward each other. The street is
text: empty because its residents are all at the festival, whose
text: noise follows them as they move away from it.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: A few more houses....
text: They move on.
scene_heading: 72	EXT. HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 72
text: Ellen watches from the street as Hoagie and Charles
text: Townsend, an islander, black, talk quietly on the porch.
text: She sees Hoagie take a small, bulging envelope from his
text: pocket and give it to Charles, who looks inside, smiles,
text: then puts it in his pocket. The two men shake hands.
scene_heading: 73	THE BARGE - DAY
dialog: 73
text: Michael and Clarence are sitting at the edge of it, their
text: feet in the water. William is flanked out near the winch,
dialog: reading.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (on the horn)
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Stop busting my hump....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, it's okay for you, but not for
dialog: me....
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: I've struck the mother-lode. I'm
dialog: counting... spade work....
scene_heading: 74	BENEATH THE SURFACE - DAY
dialog: 74
text: Jake maneuvers the sub above an enormous group of conch,
text: trying to take measure of what he's come across.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: I wish you wouldn't say that....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Spade's a garden tool....
text: Jake looks up from his clipboard and sees staring at him,
text: the dead black eye of a fish whose pupil looks to be about
text: the size of a bowling ball. He freezes, staring back at it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Trouble with you, Jake, is you have
dialog: no sense of humor....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (finding
dialog: his voice)
dialog: Holy shit!
text: The eye disappears and Jake starts looking for it.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Got a big fish down here....
scene_heading: 75	THE BARGE - DAY
dialog: 75
text: Michael stands to scan the water and the shark explodes out
text: of the water, over the low side of the barge, passing within
text: a few feet of Clarence, who freezes, his mouth open with
text: terrified surprise, and goes straight for Michael, who
text: throws himself to the deck. The shark misses him by inches,
text: unable to close its great jaws about him because of the
text: width of the barge. As quickly as it appeared, the shark
text: is gone.
scene_heading: 76	THE STREET - DAY
dialog: 76
text: Hoagie and Ellen fight their way across the street, through
text: the festival parade. The noise is deafening.
text: Suddenly Ellen stops. She shudders as she did on the beach.
text: Hoagie looks back and sees her and threads his way to her,
text: bumping into several dancers as he goes. She's staring off
text: into the distance, seeing something beyond the reach of her
dialog: vision.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Nothing....
text: She looks at him and manufactures a smile.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: No, you're not....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'm terrific... Come on....
text: She grabs his hand and pulls him into a group of dancers,
text: picking up their rhythm, trying desperately to get into
text: it. He's forced to dance with her, though every bone in
text: his body resists the idea.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (yelling above
dialog: the din)
dialog: Give it up....
text: She ignores him, throwing every ounce of energy she has
text: into the dancing.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing;
dialog: yelling)
dialog: You can't keep doing this....
text: Again she ignores him and he's bumped into and they lose
text: each other for a moment. She dances on and he has to run
text: to catch her. He takes her arm and stops her.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I can't keep doing this....
text: The merrymakers pass around them like a river rushes past
text: a rock. A band passes them and they can hardly hear
dialog: themselves think.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: You promised me a drink....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (shouting back)
dialog: Sharks come and go, Ellen. People
dialog: don't have anything to do with it....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: The kind with an umbrella in it....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Give it up... Kick it in the ass...
dialog: Get on with your life....
text: The band passes and the noise settles, momentarily, to a
text: dull roar as more dancers move around them.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I know what you're going through.
dialog: The nightmares will go away...
dialog: (grins)
dialog: I ever tell you about the time I flew
dialog: the pandas from China to a Zoo? The
dialog: lady panda fell in love with me....
text: Ellen starts to laugh. She can't stop herself. The music
text: grows louder. He holds out his hand and she looks at it,
text: then takes it and they look at each other for a long moment.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
text: A drink with an umbrella in it....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: A big one....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: A big one....
text: They push their way through the parade until they disappear
dialog: from view.

dialog: Why would it come up...?
text: Michael is still shaky, trying to get control of himself.
text: Jake's not buying any of it.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: What the hell's it doing in warm
dialog: water anyway...?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What difference does it make? It's
dialog: here....
text: Michael turns from the water and looks at Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You guys are making this into some-
dialog: thing that just isn't so... It's just
dialog: a shark. A great big bloody wonderful
dialog: shark. Don't say anything to anyone.
text: The locals find out they'll panic.
dialog: They'll want to kill it.
dialog: (his excitement
dialog: growing)
dialog: We've got us a great white, Michael.
dialog: We're going to do us some real
dialog: research....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (quietly;
dialog: matter-of-
dialog: factly)
dialog: Don't say anything about this to my
dialog: mother....
text: Michael looks back out over the water.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh, shit, man, I'm sorry....
text: He moves to Michael.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I didn't mean to run off at the mouth
dialog: like that. She's going through a lot.
dialog: I know you re hurting about your
dialog: brother....
text: Michael doesn't answer. He continues to stare at the sea,
text: his expression filled with ambivalence. Jake puts his arm
text: around him.
scene_heading: 79-A	EXT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 79-A
text: Headlights break the darkness as a car pulls up. Ellen gets
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Good night....
text: She shakes his hand and starts to take it back and he holds
text: it, looking at her in a way that suggests he'd like more.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Please, Hoagie....
text: He smiles and lets go of her hand.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Good night, Ellen....
text: The car pulls away and Ellen starts for the house.
speaker_heading: CARLA (0.S.)
dialog: Come to bed....
scene_heading: 79-B	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT - BEDROOM
dialog: 79-B
text: Michael stands at the window, in the dark, watching his

speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: He took her sightseeing. You
dialog: work.. .I work... She needs someone to
dialog: help take her mind off things....
text: He looks at her, his expression troubled. She smiles and
text: pats the bed next to him.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'll take your mind off things,
dialog: sailor....
text: He finds a small smile and moves to her open arms.
text: can be heard moving into the house.
scene_heading: 80	INT. CASINO - NIGHT
dialog: 80
text: Playing cards settle softly on a felt table. Blackjack
text: hands are being dealt to five players.
text: Louisa deals, her fast hands expertly distributing the last
text: of the "up" cards. She deals her own, then glances past the
text: players as they study their cards.
text: Jake, Carla, Ellen and Michael, all dressed for a big
text: night out,. stand in back of the players. Jake points to
text: his watch impatiently.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (mouthing the
dialog: words silently)
dialog: How much longer? This is supposed
dialog: to be your party.
speaker_heading: LOUISA
dialog: (mouthing back;
dialog: smiling)
dialog: In a few minutes....
text: Louisa starts dealing the first "hits."
text: Michael glances about. He seems on edge.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'll check the table....
text: Michael leaves, heading for another room. Ellen watches
text: him go, exposing her concern for his troubled mood.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: (to Ellen)
dialog: You want to try your hand at
dialog: something...?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'd be afraid of losing....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm afraid of winning. I wouldn't
dialog: know what to do with the money....
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Fat chance, cowboy....
text: Jake grins as a groundswell of excitement carries across
text: the room, which is filled with gamblers and decorations
text: for New Year's Eve. The joint is jumping. They look
text: for its source and see Hoagie at the crap table, accepting
text: the congratulations of those around him. He smiles as a
text: large pile of chips is raked in front of him, adding to
text: the pile he already has. Irma, an Islander, light-skinned
text: who's dressed in a low-cut satin gown with sequins, is
text: hanging on him.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Come on... I want to see....
text: Jake, Ellen on one arm, Carla on the other, moves across
text: the room as Hoagie rolls again, and wins again.
speaker_heading: 81	THE CRAP TABLE
dialog: 81
text: Hoagie sees them approaching as the pile of chips in front
text: of him grows. He smiles at Ellen, as he's given the dice
text: again. Irma gives Ellen a look. The excitement at the
text: table is high. Bets are being placed. Everyone is eyeing
text: Hoagie, who is slightly "pissed" and has a mischievous glint
text: in his eye.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Couple of more passes and I'll buy
dialog: my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own
dialog: airline....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (eyeing the
dialog: chips)
dialog: You're not going to bet it all....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: All or nothing. You want to roll
dialog: them for me?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: No!
text: Irma doesn't know what to make of Hoagie's interest in
text: Ellen. Hoagie grins, closes his eyes for a moment, making
text: his secret incantation, then opens them, smiles once more
text: at Ellen and rolls. The dice skip down the table, bounce
text: off the other end and settle. A soft moan goes up from
text: the people around the table. Hoagie's grin wavers, then
text: is restored. Irma has just seen her big night go up in
dialog: smoke.
speaker_heading: HOUSE MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Snake eyes....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Is that bad?
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Depends on your point of view....
text: He pushes his chips toward the center of the table, accepting
text: condolences from a few of the players, then steps away..
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It was theirs anyway. I 11 buy us
dialog: all a drink....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We'll buy you one. We're having a

speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Louisa's birthday....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: On New Year's Eve?
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Beats Halloween....
text: They all start for the lounge. Louisa is seen talking to
text: her relief dealer. Irma takes Hoagie's arm.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (to Jake)
dialog: When do you and Louisa get to see
dialog: each other? Between your working
dialog: days and her working nights. ...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I get her at two in the morning,
dialog: when she's at her best. Besides,
dialog: how many marine biologists can cut
text: cards with one hand and fan a
dialog: deck....
text: They thread their way through the gaming tables.
speaker_heading: JAKE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: SHIRLEY
dialog: On the house....

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I knew there was a reason I could

dialog: To the woman of my dreams.. Who
dialog: grows more beautiful....

speaker_heading: LOUISA
dialog: Oh, Jake...
dialog: (smiles)
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Happy birthday, darling. ...
text: They raise their glasses in a chorus of "Happy Birthday,"

speaker_heading: LOUISA
dialog: Don't go weak in the knees on me
dialog: tonight....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I just want to make an honest woman
dialog: of you....
speaker_heading: LOUISA
dialog: I'm not going to marry you until you
dialog: straighten out your life and your hair.
text: Irma watches it all, her gaze shifting from face to face as
text: though she's watching a tennis match.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: At least he doesn't have a beard....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (to Louisa)
dialog: Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: She's in management....
speaker_heading: LOUISA
dialog: I'm training to....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Manage the whole damn place some day.
dialog: I'm looking forward to living in the

speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: I knew a piano player once who....
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Never mind.
text: Michael eyes Hoagie, none too pleased that he's joined them.
text: Hoagie smiles at him and Michael smiles back steadily, a
dialog: kind of challenge.
speaker_heading: LOUISA
dialog: You want to marry me, you' re going to
dialog: have to straighten out your life....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (getting
dialog: into it)
dialog: He looks perfectly responsible to me....
speaker_heading: LOUISA
text: Jake's idea of responsibility ends with

speaker_heading: ELLEN

dialog: Well, I think he's cute....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Woman has taste....
speaker_heading: LOUISA

speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (to Ellen)
dialog: Would you suffer through a dance with
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (standing)
dialog: You'll be sorry.
text: Michael shifts his gaze from Jake, who he's angry at, to
text: Hoagie and his mother, a situation that's creating fresh
text: alarm. They're moving to the dance floor. Irma is
text: abjectly unhappy.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: I have two right feet.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Good. I have two left....
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: (to Michael)

speaker_heading: LOUISA
dialog: My party....
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: He's depressed because he's started
dialog: to count conch when he goes to

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Excuse me....

scene_heading: 83	THE DANCE FLOOR
dialog: 83
text: Ellen smiles at Hoagie, caught up in the story he's started
text: telling her. He stops when he sees Michael heading for
text: them. She sees her son.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (as lightly as
dialog: he can)
dialog: Mind if I cut in? Your date's
dialog: lonely....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: The world would be a better place if

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (finally; a

dialog: sarcasm)
dialog: You're having a good time....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I am.

text: getting caught up in their conversation.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Stop pouting. You look like you did

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: ELLEN

dialog: And that's ridiculous....

speaker_heading: ELLEN

dialog: I've been a pain in the ass and I'm
dialog: sorry.
text: He looks at her quizzically.
speaker_heading: ELLEN

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're not a pain in the ass....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Will you let me finish. I've been
dialog: working on this all day.
text: She smiles at him, then becomes serious.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Your brother's death almost killed
dialog: me. I m not sure I'll ever get over
dialog: it. But I can't allow myself to
dialog: keep on believing it was intentional.
dialog: I'm not going to let an obsession
dialog: run my life.
text: Michael stares at his mother uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's not easy. None of it is. I
dialog: have to find some way to get on with
dialog: my life and I'm going to try. I
dialog: finally figured that out. I'm going
dialog: to do my best....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Good.

speaker_heading: ELLEN

dialog: No more sharks. I'll stay for another

dialog: life, Michael. I have to live it.
dialog: Besides, I'll be back. Now show
dialog: your mother what a good dancer you
dialog: are.
text: She rests her head on his shoulder and they dance on. His

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: We'll never get this chance again....
dialog: It's what we were trained for, for

text: She starts for her studio.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, okay. Now I understand. All
dialog: you had to do was explain it.

text: moves inside. Then he starts after her.
scene_heading: 88	INT. STUDIO - DAY
dialog: 88
text: She grabs her welder's mask, then fires up her torch. He
text: enters.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (before he's
dialog: seen)
dialog: I take out the garbage, because...I'm
dialog: glad we got that straightened out....
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: We don't have anything straightened
dialog: out. You're uptight about something
dialog: ...what's wrong?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why should there be anything wrong?
dialog: I'm sitting around the house,
dialog: enjoying my day off and you start
dialog: yelling at me about garbage....
text: She gives him a hard, steady look which says, there's more
dialog: to it than garbage.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing;
dialog: quietly)
dialog: What the hell are we arguing about?
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I don't know...You...I don't know.
text: He moves toward her and she holds the torch toward him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No fair, I'm not armed.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Then don't come any closer.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Turn it off....
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: No....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Off....
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I have work....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I've always wanted to make love to
dialog: an angry welder. I've dreamed of
dialog: nothing else since I was a small boy.
text: She can't help smiling. She turns the torch off and he
text: moves the rest of the way to her and kisses her.
speaker_heading: CARLA

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: They're at the beach....

scene_heading: 59	THE BARGE - DAY
dialog: 59
text: Jake is secured to the davit with a line. Michael is tying
text: another line around his waist. Clarence and William are
text: chumming the water with meat and blood. Several large
text: chunks of horse meat are on lines, over the side. Jake
text: holds a long pole to which the heart monitoring device,
text: with its barbs, is attached. The big boat, their floating
text: lab, is secured to one side of the barge.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You sure you've done this before?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Lots of times....
text: Michael tests the knot, then Jake moves to the edge of the
text: barge and leans out as far as he can.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And it's always worked?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (grinning
dialog: back at him)
dialog: So far..
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: It's coming....
text: They see the fin making its way toward the barge. Michael
text: tenses, moving back toward the center of the barge until
text: the line he's holding goes taut.
text: Jake, the pole held high, watches as the shark gets closer,
text: his body tensing as he gets ready.
text: Michael is rigid, mesmerized with the approaching shark, his
text: expression filled with what he's wondering -- will it try to
dialog: get him?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You remember how to pull a rope...?
text: Michael looks at Jake blankly, then stares at the oncoming
text: shark, which comes closer and closer, then, at the last
text: moment rolls to its side and opens its great jaws and goes
dialog: for the horse meat.
text: Jake waits until the shark's underside is at its most exposed,
text: then rams the pole into it, then pulls it back quickly.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hot damn! We got it!
text: Michael is still transfixed. Jake looks back at him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Now would be a good time....
text: Michael remembers his job and pulls Jake back to the barge.
text: The shark, a thirty-pound piece of horse meat in its mouth,
text: rolls away, disappearing beneath the surface.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Let's see if the damn thing works....
scene_heading: 90	WATERFRONT CAFE - DAY

text: Ellen stares out at the water, her expression wistful.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You don't have to do anything you
dialog: don't want to....
text: She turns to Hoagie, who's sitting across the table from
text: her. He sips his coffee and studies her. She looks past
text: him to the others who are still eating lunch.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Our little island seems to agree
dialog: with you....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I have my own little island.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: But it gets cold in winter....
text: She smiles at that and sips her coffee.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I tried winter once. Burlington,
dialog: Vermont. Flew a run to New York. I
dialog: have a bone in my foot that still
dialog: hasn't thawed. When I was a small
dialog: boy....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: That's hard to imagine....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: I dreamed about always being warm...
dialog: Stay a while....
text: His tone of voice causes her to look at him quizzically.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I could take some time off....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You're always taking time off....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: I like to travel....
text: She smiles and he returns it.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'll nick the boss' plane again....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: I borrow it without telling him....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Won't you get in trouble...?
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Only if he finds out... It's a short
dialog: hop to the Caribbean. We could take
dialog: a few days....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: There must be plenty of women who
dialog: would be glad to go....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: There are...I'm tired of one-way
dialog: conversations....
text: They look at each other for a long moment.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I have this overwhelming desire to
dialog: kiss you, Ellen Brody.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (her cheeks
dialog: flooding with
dialog: color)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Because it wouldn't occur to you to
dialog: know why. Blushing suits you....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'm sorry...I....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: There's nothing to be sorry about.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: The whole idea is preposterous....
text: His expression takes on the color of his feelings. He
dialog: likes this woman, a lot.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: I don't think so....
text: She's flustered and unsure how to respond.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (finally;
dialog: trying to
dialog: make light
dialog: of it)
dialog: You sure you don't need glasses?
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: My vision is perfect....
text: He leans across the table and kisses her.
scene_heading: 90-A	NEPTUNE'S FOLLY - DAY
dialog: 90-A
text: The shark's heartbeat is heard, then seen on the scope.
text: Jake glances at it, then at Michael, who's at the wheel.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What are we getting out of this old
dialog: bucket?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What she's got. Nine knots....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Shit....
text: He turns his attention back to the scope. The heartbeat
text: line is beginning to flatten. Jake climbs up on the boom
text: and scans the water. Michael does the same from his position
text: at the wheel. He looks to Jake, who's shielding his eyes
text: against the glare, holding the mast with his other hand.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (finally)
dialog: How long have you known Hoagie?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How long have you known Hoagie?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What the hell does Hoagie have to do
dialog: with this?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: As long as he's been here....
text: Jake turns his attention back to the water. The sound of
text: the heartbeat is growing weaker.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Bring her to starboard.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (turning the
dialog: wheel)
dialog: How long has he been here...?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hoagie.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't remember. One day he was
dialog: just here....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What do you know about him?
text: Jake checks the EKG scope. The line is nearly flat. The
text: heartbeats are a whisper.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: He's after my mother....
text: Jake laughs, looking at Michael as though he's crazy.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's so funny about that?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You think he's not good enough for
dialog: her? You're right. If she was my
dialog: mother, I'd send her home right now.
text: He turns his attention back to the scope, then scans the
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Bring her about. We're headed in
dialog: the wrong direction....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Half the pilots down here fly drugs
dialog: ...He's always going off....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Half don't...Bring her about....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I am...You must know something about
dialog: him....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: He gambles...He likes a good time...I
dialog: see him around....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I hear he flies a lot of private
dialog: charters....
text: The heartbeats have stopped and Jake snaps around to look
text: at the scope. The line is dead flat. He's stunned.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We lost it....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Maybe the gear crapped out....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: If you hadn't been gassing about
dialog: Hoagie....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Maybe it's gone....
text: Jake gives him an angry look, then starts fiddling with the
text: gear. Finally, in his frustration, he bangs it with his
text: hand. Michael seems quietly relieved.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We'll look for it tomorrow....
text: Michael doesn't respond.

dialog: nuts.
speaker_heading: ELLEN (0.S.)
dialog: All he did was kiss me....
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: It's beginning....
text: Ellen is at the base of the sculpture, watching Carla, her
text: back to the door.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Beginning of what?
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Whatever happens next.....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I always thought when I grew up I'd
dialog: know what to do about things like
dialog: this...I don't even know if he's
dialog: serious....
text: Neither of them sees Thea, who's moved into the studio and
dialog: has decided not to announce herself.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Give it some time, Ellen...See what
dialog: happens.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Part of me wanted to go off with
dialog: him, the rest of me couldn't...I
dialog: don't know why he wants me....
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Maybe he's got good taste...I don't
dialog: think he's spent much time with a
dialog: woman like you....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I don't know what he thinks...I don't
dialog: know what I think...I don't even know
dialog: why I'm talking about it...
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: It's silly...I'm getting too old for
dialog: this sort of thing....
text: She spots Thea and stops suddenly. Carla follows her gaze.
speaker_heading: THEA
dialog: You said it wasn't polite to interrupt
dialog: people....
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Yes, I did.
speaker_heading: THEA
dialog: It's time for tea, Grandma.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I almost forgot....
speaker_heading: THEA
dialog: I didn't.

speaker_heading: THEA

scene_heading: 90-C	INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
speaker_heading: 90-C
text: Michael stands at the window, looking out at the night.
text: He's troubled. He clasps his hands behind his back,
text: unaware that Thea is standing behind him, her troubled
text: expression a mirror of his, her hands behind her back, her
text: tiny feet spread apart exactly like his. He scratches his
text: cheek unconsciously and she does the same. She checks his
text: facial expression and resets hers.
text: He sighs and she sighs and he hears and looks down,
text: surprised to see her, then noticing that she's assumed his
text: body posture in every way. He makes a funny face and she
text: makes one back and he smiles and she returns it.
speaker_heading: THEA
dialog: Uncle Sean could make funny faces....
text: He snatches her up off the floor and hugs her, holding onto
text: her tightly.
text: Ellen watches from the doorway, unobserved, her concern for

text: offers a quick smile.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (to Thea)
dialog: Time for bed, peanut....
text: Michael gives his daughter a kiss and puts her down and she
text: moves to her grandmother.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'll be in to read you a story.
speaker_heading: THEA
dialog: Good night, Daddy....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Good night, dear heart....
text: Thea leaves and Michael takes a beer from the refrigerator
text: and moves to the table where three empty cans are lined up
text: neatly. He pops the top of the new one and takes a long
text: drink, then sits and returns to the writing of his report
text: on their conch project. There are several open textbooks
text: and several notebooks in front of them.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (finally)
dialog: It's late....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Trying to write our report....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You look tired....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm fine....
text: She studies him as he tries to write.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I saw you and Thea....
text: He looks up, making it clear that he doesn't want to talk.
text: She sees it but presses on.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You and Sean used to make....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I have to get this finished.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I'm leaving in a few days. I don't

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: There's nothing to worry about....
speaker_heading: ELLEN

text: He offers a small smile, then goes back to work.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You looked just like your father...
dialog: The first time the shark came to
dialog: Amity....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don't want to talk about that.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: It's a terrible thing to know some-
dialog: thing no one else wants to believe.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (angry)
dialog: I'm tired of hearing about it.
dialog: There's no shark. Sean wasn't
dialog: killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't
dialog: die because of it...It's all wrong...
dialog: Some fantasy you've concocted...You
dialog: keep bringing it up.
text: He goes back to work, ignoring her. She wants to say more
text: but stops herself. Instead she starts looking through the
dialog: refrigerator.
speaker_heading: ELLEN

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: 90-D
text: The surface is searched, as though something is being
text: looked for. The shark is seen, swimming, just swimming,
text: its fin slicing through the water as though it's hearing
text: its own music. Then, without warning, it attacks, coming
text: straight at us, its great jaws opening wide, rolling to one
text: side as it comes for the kill -- its great rows of teeth
text: enveloping us, closing down on us, consuming us, until it
text: goes dark.

text: Michael pushes the sub to its limit, when suddenly it's hit
text: and Michael's teeth are rattled as the sub is knocked
text: through the water.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Jake! Jake!
text: The shark hits the sub again, his great jaws tearing into the
text: canopy and prop, damaging the sub badly. It turns then and
text: almost leisurely swims away, its mouth bleeding, its head
text: raked with cuts. Michael eyes it, then the nearby wreck
text: and pushes himself free of the sub, swimming as fast as he
text: can toward the freighter. The shark turns and starts after
text: him, closing the distance rapidly as Michael makes for an

speaker_heading: JAKE (0.S.)

dialog: Michael! Can you hear me....
scene_heading: 94	NEPTUNE'S FOLLY - DAY

scene_heading: 95	BENEATH THE WATER - DAY

text: The shark is gone. He looks up and down the corridor, then
text: starts swimming away from the light.
text: The corridor begins to turn dark as a huge black shadow
text: fills the other end.
text: Michael senses something and looks back and sees the shadow
text: of the shark against the wall. He freezes as the shadow
text: moves toward him, finally covering his face.
text: The shark comes closer and Michael starts backing up. The
text: shark moves closer, almost lazily opening its jaws as it
text: prepares to devour him. Michael keeps backing up, then
text: trips and falls backwards through a door, his arms coming
text: up as he tries to stop himself.
text: His fall takes him down into a room. Light floods into it
text: from above. He gathers himself and looks up.
text: There's no sign of the shark. He looks about quickly, taking
text: measure of his situation, then the light above is blacked out
text: as the shark swims slowly over the room. Michael watches,
text: barely breathing, until the light returns. He listens and
text: looks and waits. The silence builds. Where the hell is it?

dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, Carla Brody....
text: Applause greets her introduction and she nods and smiles

text: Ellen eyes Thea as the banana boat makes a sweeping turn
text: and heads back across the water in front of them.
text: As Mr. Witherspoon and Carla pull the cord, Ellen sees the
text: fin pop up out of the water behind the banana boat. As the
text: cloth comes free of the statue, the crowd breaks into loud,
text: anticipatory applause. It covers Ellen's scream. She
text: starts running for the beach, yelling as she goes. The fin
text: moves closer to the boat. The applause begins to trickle
text: away as the crowd begins to realize the nature of the huge
text: abstract work of art. They don't understand it.
text: Mr. Witherspoon looks at it quizzically.
text: Ellen's screams are heard now and Carla sees her running

dialog: 119
text: Margaret's mother sees what's going on on the beach and
text: finally looks in back of her and sees the fin and then the
text: shark as it comes up out of the water for Thea. She
text: grabs the child, pushing her forward, putting herself in
text: the way. The shark rips into her and she's pulled into the
text: water, then beneath it. Thea screams, but nothing comes
text: out. Air starts leaking from the inflatable boat. The
text: water around it starts filling with blood.
text: Ellen watches her granddaughter, horrified.
text: Dozens of people line the water's edge around her, yelling,
text: crowding around as the speedboat brings what's left of
text: the banana boat to shore. Thea and the other two kids
text: and remaining adult are holding on for dear life as they're

text: Carla, with Louisa at her heels, wades out toward them,

speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Thea...I'm here, Thea...Mommy's

text: Ellen stares at the sea, then at her granddaughter, who

dialog: the other side)
dialog: Give me a hand here for Christ's
dialog: sake....
text: They turn and see Hoagie struggling to climb aboard and
text: move quickly to help him.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing;
dialog: grinning)
dialog: That thing has terrible breath....
text: They pull him aboard and he smiles at Ellen, who is very
text: happy indeed to see him.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What say we get the hell out of
dialog: here, Ellen Brody. ...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Get her started....
text: Hoagie and Michael start for the engine. Ellen watches
text: them, then looks out over the water for the shark. Jake
text: turns on the heart monitor and EKG scope and a moment later
text: the sound of the shark's heartbeat, which is faint, starts
text: coming through the speaker, and the sight of its rhythmic
text: beating is seen on the scope.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It's working....
text: Hoagie watches as Michael tries to get the engine started.
dialog: It won't turn over.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Not the engine, pal....
text: Jake heads for the cabin.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (as he goes)
dialog: Get it going, Hoagie. Michael....
text: Michael follows Jake below. Hoagie jumps down into the
text: engine pit and starts checking the fuel line.
text: Ellen stares out to sea, waiting for what she knows will
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: (from below;
dialog: yelling)
dialog: They spend half their lives looking
dialog: for food and the other half eating
dialog: it They don't care what it is....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: It's not food it's after....
text: The distant sounds of the shark's heart continue to be heard.
scene_heading: 152	BELOW DECKS - DAY
dialog: 152
text: Jake takes the top off an underwater strobe light and
text: begins rewiring rapidly, changing connections. Michael
dialog: watches.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (in the
dialog: midst of it)
dialog: If it works, if we can get it inside
dialog: the bastard and set it off, it'll
dialog: shock the hell out of it. We'll
dialog: need a slave switch to set it off.
text: Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
text: Michael starts pulling the battery.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: All the time....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It'll work....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Theory, partner...If it responds to
dialog: external electrical impulse, it
dialog: might respond to one coming from
dialog: inside it...Confuse it...Drive it
dialog: away....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: If we're real lucky, it'll eat
dialog: itself....
scene_heading: 153	ABOVE DECKS - DAY
dialog: 153
text: Hoagie hands Ellen sparkplugs, which she dries with a rag.
text: She continues to glance at the sea, her expression set with
text: the inevitable. The shark's faint heartbeats are heard.
scene_heading: 154	BELOW DECKS - DAY
dialog: 154
text: Jake is taping a cover over the strobe base. Michael is
text: wiring another strobe light to the battery.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Wait for the sucker to charge, then
dialog: hit the switch. Just like taking a
dialog: picture.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The big picture...If we can't get
dialog: him to swallow it, we'll shove it
dialog: up his....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I forgot my rubber gloves. Let's do
dialog: it.
text: They head for the deck
scene_heading: 155	ABOVE DECKS - DAY
dialog: 155
text: As Michael and Jake move topside, they see Hoagie and Ellen
text: staring at the speaker and EKG scope. The heartbeats have
text: stopped. The line on the scope is flat.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Your equipment has crapped out
dialog: again....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: My equipment doesn't crap out....
text: Jake grabs a pole from the deck and throws it to Michael,
text: then starts tying the device to the end of it. His hands
text: are trembling.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Maybe it had a heart attack. Too
text: much fatty food. Humans are full of
dialog: cholesterol.
text: Hoagie gets the last sparkplug screwed back in and tries
text: the engine and it kicks to life.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Son-of-a-bitch!
text: Jake starts for the bow.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (to Michael)
dialog: Get a line....
text: Michael grabs a coiled line from the deck and follows Jake
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (to Ellen)
dialog: We're going to make it....
text: She just stares at him, not believing it for a moment.
text: Jake is standing at the bow, looking out over the water.
text: Michael reaches him with the line.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'll do it, Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No way....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's my fault...I have to....
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We need it to eat electronics, man
dialog: ...Not you. Get it on me....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (a plea)
dialog: Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: I'm the one who wanted to study
dialog: it....
text: Michael relents and quickly ties the line around Jake's
text: waist. Jake makes his way out to the end of the bowsprit,
text: using the guy wire from the mast for support. Michael
text: passes him the pole with the device at the end of it.
text: Ellen and Hoagie watch from the stern. He's underway.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (continuing;
dialog: yelling back)
dialog: Keep it steady....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Aye, aye, Captain....
text: The shark explodes up completely out of the water, clearing
text: the surface, opening its jaws as it comes directly for
text: Michael, who leaps back.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Michael!
text: Jake moves back on the bowsprit, getting in the shark's
text: way, and as the shark flies up toward Jake, he rams the
text: pole down its throat. The pole snaps and the shark takes
text: the device, Jake and a piece of the bowsprit.
text: Ellen screams.
text: The guy wire flies loose and the already weakened mast
text: begins to fall.
text: Michael pulls at the line, which goes limp in his hands.
text: Jake, in the shark's mouth, goes crashing into the water.
text: The mast crashes into the boat and water.
text: Ellen and Hoagie are running forward.
text: Michael watches as Jake and the shark disappear beneath the
dialog: surface.
text: In the distance, the three of them see the shark rise up
text: out of the water. Part of Jake is seen in its jaws. Then
dialog: they're gone.
text: The heartbeats are heard again.
text: Michael opens his mouth and a great wail of anguish comes
text: out and carries out over the water.
text: Hoagie dashes back toward the controls. Ellen, taking
text: strength from her son's need, grabs his arm, hard.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Michael!
text: There are tears in his eyes.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Get that goddamn gizmo of Jake's
dialog: working....
text: Michael stares at the sea. Ellen looks at her son
text: compassionately, then Michael starts for the cabin and
text: Ellen follows to the deck near Hoagie, where she watches
dialog: the water.
text: The shark's heartbeats are getting louder and closer
text: together. Hoagie eyes the speaker as he opens the throttle,
dialog: giving it everything its got.
scene_heading: 156	BELOW DECKS - DAY
dialog: 156
text: Michael grabs the slave switch and turns it on and it
text: begins to whine as the strobe unit in the shark's stomach
text: begins to charge.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE (O.S.)
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: It's coming....
text: He hits the switch too soon. Nothing happens. He can hear
text: the heartbeats thumping a frenzy as the shark begins its
dialog: attack.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: HOAGIE (0.S.)
dialog: Nothing! What the hell are you doing
dialog: down there?
text: The whine begins to build again.
scene_heading: 157	ABOVE DECKS - DAY
dialog: 157
text: The heartbeats sound like an invitation to hell. Hoagie
text: grabs Ellen's arm.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Take the wheel....
text: He leaves it before she does and runs to the cabin. She
text: takes his place, glancing at the water, seeing the fin.
text: Her expression floods with rage and she turns the wheel
text: toward the shark, trying to meet it head on.
scene_heading: 158	BELOW DECKS - DAY
dialog: 158
text: Hoagie sticks his head in the door.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: The damn thing is going to have our
dialog: asses....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It needs more time to charge.
text: They start topside. Michael brings the slave switch with
dialog: him.
scene_heading: 159	ABOVE DECKS/THE WATER - DAY
dialog: 159
text: Ellen is bringing the boat directly toward the shark, which
text: is coming straight for them. The heartbeats are deafening.
text: As Hoagie and Michael move topside, the boat and the shark
text: collide head on, sending shock waves from stem to stern.
text: Ellen holds onto the wheel with both hands and keeps her
text: feet. Michael and Hoagie are knocked on their asses.
text: The heartbeats retreat, then start growing louder and
text: stronger again. The whine of the strobe has stopped.
text: Michael hits the switch several times and it starts again.
text: Ellen sees the fin and steers toward it. The shark is
text: coming again, like an old boxer looking for the knockout
text: punch in the fifteenth round.
text: The boat and the shark are heading for each other, the
text: distance between them closing fast.
text: Ellen drives the boat toward it.
text: The slave switch makes a popping sound, and Michael hits the
text: switch and the flash in his hand goes off.
text: The water explodes as the shark receives an enormous jolt
text: of electricity. It thrashes about wildly then, in slow
text: motion, some twenty-five feet from the boat, right in front
text: of it, the shark rises up out of the water, exposing half
text: its body. It seems suspended there, its great head pointed
text: right at Ellen, its dead black eyes seeming to stare
text: straight at her.
text: Holding fast to the wheel, her expression set hard, Ellen
text: drives the boat straight at the shark. She pushes the
text: throttle forward, hard, getting the last bit of speed from
text: the engine, driving straight into the beast, impaling it in
text: the throat with what's left of the sharp jagged end of the
dialog: bowsprit.
text: The shark goes crazy, its weight pulling the bow down into
text: the water as it tries to free itself, thrashing about so
text: violently that it turns the bow into splinters.
text: Ellen, Michael and Hoagie are thrown into the water.
scene_heading: 160	THE WATER - DAY
dialog: 160
text: They watch as the shark dies its violent death, taking what
text: remains of the boat beneath the surface with it.
scene_heading: 161	BENEATH THE SURFACE - DAY
dialog: 161
text: The shark and the boat sink slowly to the bottom.
scene_heading: 162	THE SURFACE - DAY
dialog: 162
text: Ellen, exhausted, emptied of everything, begins to sob.
dialog: Everything she feels, everything she's suppressed about
text: Sean's death pours out of her. She begins to slip beneath
text: the surface. Hoagie grabs her.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I can't....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Yes you can....
text: Michael reaches them and together, helping Ellen, they swim
text: to a large piece of the boat which is floating nearby.
text: Holding it, catching their breath, Ellen still crying, they
text: look out across the water, silently remembering Jake.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It's over....
text: Ellen stares at the sea, her expression etched with
dialog: uncertainty. Is it over? Will it ever be?
text: Our vision shifts from Ellen to her point of view of the
text: endless expanse of ocean. In the distance the clouds seem
text: to be reaching for its surface. Slowly, almost
text: indiscernibly at first, the closing music begins. Another
text: sound, that of airplane engines is heard.
speaker_heading: 163	OMITTED
dialog: 163
scene_heading: 164	THE AIRPORT - DAY
dialog: 164
text: The noise of the air taxi's engines, as they're warmed up,
text: is loud. The music, which builds slowly, relentlessly,
text: continues. Closing credits begin, like punctuation marks.
text: Hoagie is in the cockpit.
text: Ellen, who's dressed for travel, Michael, who carries Thea,
text: and Carla approach the plane.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (yelling
dialog: to be heard
dialog: above the
dialog: noise)
dialog: I want you all to come to Amity this
dialog: summer.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: There's a lot...I want to talk about
dialog: it....
text: He's having trouble.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: We will...We'll have a lot of time
dialog: together.
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: What are you going to do now?
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: We'll be there....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (to Thea)
dialog: You make sure they come?
speaker_heading: THEA
dialog: (yelling;
dialog: liking the
dialog: excitement)
dialog: I will. I'll miss you, Grandma.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I'll miss you....
text: They've reached the plane and Hoagie and Ellen make eye
dialog: contact.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (eyeing
dialog: his mother
dialog: and Hoagie)
dialog: Promise me you'll be all right....
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (turning
dialog: to him;
dialog: yelling)
dialog: Promise me....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful
dialog: ...I'll be....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (yelling;
dialog: grinning)
dialog: Mothers and sons...Mine used to tell
dialog: me to wear clean shorts....
speaker_heading: ELLEN/HOAGIE
dialog: (both yelling;
dialog: both enjoying
dialog: the moment)
dialog: In case you got hit by a car....
text: They laugh above the noise. Michael and Hoagie eye each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (yelling
dialog: at Hoagie)
dialog: You know, you try harder not to give
dialog: a damn than anyone I've ever met?
text: Hoagie, straining to hear, grins.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: What?
text: Michael moves closer, Thea still in his arms.
speaker_heading: THEA
dialog: (before
dialog: Michael
dialog: can repeat
dialog: himself;
text: yelling).
dialog: Can I fly the plane again...?
text: The music dips now, as Hoagie takes a long 1ook at Thea,
text: his smile building warmly.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: Absolutely...Any time....
text: He beckons her with his finger and Michael holds her closer.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Can you keep a secret? Something no
dialog: one else knows?
speaker_heading: THEA
dialog: (still
dialog: yelling at
dialog: the top of
dialog: her lungs)
dialog: Yes I can....
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (yelling
dialog: back)
dialog: I own the airplane. I can do
dialog: whatever I want. I'm the boss.
text: Michael, Ellen and Carla react.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Which means I have to go a lot of
dialog: places to pay my debts and borrow
dialog: money to keep it going....
text: He looks at Michael with mischief in his eye. The music
text: begins to build again, toward its climax. Credits continue.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (continuing;
dialog: yelling louder)
dialog: Remind me when I get back to tell
dialog: you about the time I flew a hundred
dialog: nuns to Nairobi....
text: Michael and others laugh, but it's lost in the sound of the
text: engines and the music. The family moves to the plane's
text: door. Ellen kisses Carla and Thea good-bye, then turns to
dialog: Michael.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (above the
dialog: noise)
dialog: We never had that talk, did we?
text: He looks at her, troubled, and she smiles at him.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We will...We'll have a lot of time
dialog: together, Michael....
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: I'm going to finish what Jake and I
dialog: started. I owe him that. Hell, I
dialog: owe him everything....
dialog: (shouting;
dialog: hardly heard)
dialog: I'll get something important done
dialog: for both of us....
text: Ellen and Michael embrace, then kiss each other good-bye.
speaker_heading: HOAGIE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: There they were, all hundred of
dialog: them....
text: His last words are drowned out by engines and music and he
text: shrugs as he and Ellen smile at each other. She takes a
text: last look at her family, then boards the plane and the door
text: closes behind her.
scene_heading: 165	THE AIRPORT/THE PLANE - DAY
dialog: 165
text: As music and credits continue, the plane takes off and
text: starts out over the ocean, heading for Nassau.
text: Michael, holding Thea, and Carla, her arm through his,
text: watch as the plane becomes smaller and smaller, until it is
text: lost in the vastness of the sky and the sky is transformed
text: into ocean and music and credits end.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
