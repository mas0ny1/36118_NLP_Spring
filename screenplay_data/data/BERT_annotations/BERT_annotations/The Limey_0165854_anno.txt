text: NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS.
text: THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS SOFT COPY.
dialog: Wilson's first impression of Los Angeles was blue. He was in
text: the sky at the time, so it was a curious reversal, looking
text: down rather than up at the color he had always felt was
dialog: nature's finest.
text: Swimming pools. Hundreds of them. Pockmarking the landscape
text: like miniature lakes. A flat landscape of straight streets
text: and square blocks and sparse grass that didn't look quite
dialog: green enough.
dialog: As far as Wilson could remember, he had only ever seen seven
dialog: or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been
dialog: public ones. Here everyone had their own. Marvellous.
dialog: There was the one at the Butlin's holiday camp where he had
dialog: enjoyed his last legitimate employment -- as driver of a tour
dialog: bus. And there was the one at Crystal Palace he had gone to
dialog: once or twice when he was younger. He was most familiar,
dialog: though, with the Chelsea Baths as he had lived for some time
text: in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years
dialog: -- before he'd gone grey, went to prison, and found himself in
text: a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of
dialog: his daughter.
text: WHOOSH! The sound of automatic doors opening and --
scene_heading: EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL. L.A. AIRPORT. AFTERNOON.
text: WILSON steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the
text: day. A slow-motion moment while he gets acclimatized. He
dialog: wouldn't have ever felt quite this kind of heat before.
text: After such a rigorously air-conditioned interior. Or seen
text: cops wearing guns on their belts. Or black cops, for that
text: matter, with guns on their belts. Or seen people as fat as
dialog: Americans on their home turf. Things someone from England
text: notices immediately, whether consciously at first or not.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL. EVENING.
dialog: Wilson's not here for comfort. Shown to a shitty room, round
text: the corner of a typical 2nd-level outside walkway. Airport
text: close by.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. EVENING.
text: He draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy
text: glide. His moves are neat. His expressions just as
text: economical, not giving much away. Outside the planes are
text: practically on top of us. The sunset colors strange and
dialog: chemical.
text: He's only got one light bag. Unzips, unpacks a few things.
text: Change of clothes, a travel kit, and some familiar items
dialog: (shaving foam/toothpaste/deodorant} bearing unfamiliar
dialog: British brand names.
text: Goes into the bathroom. Turns on the shower in there.
text: Comes back to sit on the bed. Takes an envelope out of his
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: ENVELOPE
text: Turns it over to see the return address on the back.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI. NIGHT.
text: Wilson in the back. Stares at the impenetrable name on the
text: driver's posted ID. Glances at the driver.
text: DRIVER glances back at his quiet passenger in the rearview
dialog: mirror.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Wilson walks up a cracked little path to the front door.
text: Lower middle-class street. Two cars in the driveway, one
text: behind the other. Lights on inside the house -- as he rings
dialog: the bell.
speaker_heading: ED RAMA
text: Answers it. Hispanic. Late 30's. Chairman Mao on his T-
dialog: shirt notwithstanding, an easygoing sort of fellow. Not
dialog: looking for any trouble -- anymore. But once did, and able
text: to handle himself if any shows up. Which it has.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Edward Rama?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Eduardo.
dialog: (rolling the R)
dialog: Rama.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: You're home, then.
text: He turns, waves away the taxi he's kept waiting. While
text: Eduardo Rama waits for an introduction.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: My name's Wilson.
text: Accent speaks for itself. Hard, working-class.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Wilson?
text: Knows the name. But just now it's unexpected. He's holding
text: a hot TV dinner, hand protected by a dish towel.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: You wrote to me about my daughter.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. ED'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Ed takes Wilson inside.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I didn't expect anyone.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: No reason.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I mean, what has it been -- six months?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Round about, yeah.
text: They've entered a cauldron of family life. TV blaring
text: (SHOWBIZ TONIGHT!). A couple of younger KIDS yelling "Mama".
text: Their MOTHER shouting back at them from the kitchen (in
text: Spanish) that she only has two hands. A sullen TEENAGER
text: walking by.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I didn't even know who I was writing to --
dialog: just someone with the same last name.
dialog: She never talked about any family.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: It was better than a telegram.
text: Ed opens a screen door to the backyard.
scene_heading: EXT. ED'S BACKYARD. NIGHT.
text: They sit at an outdoor table. Wilson with a TV dinner in
text: front of him now too. Sounds from inside MUTED. Even this
text: little house has a little pool.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Who done it, then?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Snuffed her.
text: Ed surprised at Wilson's directness. Ed stands nervously.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Now, wait up a second, man.
text: And paces back and forth.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I never said nothin' about nothin' like
dialog: that. No, no, no. That's not what I
dialog: wrote to you.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: No, but between the lines, eh?
dialog: Mysterious circumstances, and that.
text: Ed stops pacing.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Look, I sent you that newspaper clipping,
dialog: all right? I told you what I know. It
dialog: was an accident. I didn't say anything
dialog: about anybody being "snuffed."
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: This bloke she was bunked up with. This
dialog: Terry what'sit.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Terry Valentine.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Valentine. What's he got to say for
dialog: himself?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I dunno. What's he gonna say? They had
dialog: a fight that night, she drove away, she
dialog: was upset? I don't even know the guy.
dialog: Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were
dialog: friends, but we didn't travel in the same
dialog: social circles. She had her life, I had
dialog: mine.
dialog: Makes a kind of scoffing gesture: and you can see what my
dialog: life is.
speaker_heading: ED
text: Valentine came into the restaurant where
dialog: I work with Jenny a couple times. He's a
dialog: money guy. Jenny would say, hey, here's
dialog: my friend Eddie and he would shake my
dialog: hand and everything, but he wouldn't even
dialog: see me, you know what I mean.
text: Wilson gazes up at the sky. Clear night. Stars.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: How long had she been in the States?
dialog: (as if to himself, somewhat
dialog: wistful)
dialog: Near on ten years, wasn't it? Long
dialog: enough to know her way about, I reckon.
text: Ed leans down, palms on the tabletop, facing Wilson.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: There was an investigation, okay? The
dialog: car was totalled. Jennifer was ... Her
text: neck was broken. On impact, they said.
dialog: So she wouldn't have ... felt the effects
dialog: of the fire.
dialog: (helpless shrug)
dialog: It happens up there. Happens a lot.
dialog: What more can I tell you.
text: Wilson taps out a cigarette from a pack of "Silk Cut" he's
text: produced from his pocket.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: What more is there.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep
dialog: hillside. There was no moon that
dialog: night ...
text: Wilson's quiet stillness is getting to him.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Coulda happened to anyone, man. I never
dialog: knew her to be reckless. I mean, sure,
dialog: she would smoke a little grass, or
dialog: something, have a few drinks. But that's
dialog: it, nothing more than that.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: No, not my girl. Self-control, she had.
dialog: Point of pride.
dialog: (smokes)
dialog: And people don't change, do they.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I dunno ... Maybe they do.
text: Wilson notes the tattoos on Ed's forearms.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Going straight, are ya.
text: Ed looks at him. Sits down again. Keeping his forearms under
dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (looks away)
dialog: Boomerang.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Y'what?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I knew when I was droppin' that letter
dialog: into the mail slot it was gonna come back
text: and smack me in the face.
dialog: (looks at Wilson again)
dialog: I did my time, okay? My sister, her ol'
dialog: man's up in Chino right now doin' eight
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (re the family inside)
dialog: This ain't your lot?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You kiddin', man? I don't need a wife
dialog: and screamin' kids. I still got my
dialog: youth.
text: And yet -- he lives here. Wilson declines to pursue the
dialog: matter.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I go to work, try to keep my life
dialog: together, put all that shit behind me,
dialog: man. What d'you want from me.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (calmly smoking)
dialog: I only asked.
text: Ed sighs. Reaches for one of Wilson's cigarettes.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Couple weeks before she died, Jennifer
dialog: asked me to drive her downtown. Said she
dialog: was meeting -- her boyfriend --
dialog: Valentine. But I think she was looking
dialog: for him.
scene_heading: <i>FLASH CUTS:
text: ED AND JENNIFER. In a car, downtown. She has the same steely
text: intensity as her father. Ed looks a little worried.</i>
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (lighting Ed's cigarette)
dialog: What, tryin' to catch him with another
dialog: bird?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That's what I thought, man. But it was
dialog: not a hotel or nothin' that we went to.
dialog: It was someplace else.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Where abouts?
scene_heading: <i>FLASH CUTS:
text: JENNIFER. Talking to a beefy SUPERVISOR. Or talking at him.
text: Either way, he isn't happy.
text: MEAT PUPPETS. Watch instead of working.
dialog: ED. Taking all this in.</i>
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bad place, man. Bad people. Some guys
dialog: loading some trucks. Some kinda deal
dialog: goin' down.
dialog: (anticipating Wilson's next
dialog: question)
dialog: I don't know and I don't care. Maybe
dialog: they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Did Jenny know?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Valentine wasn't even there. If he was
dialog: into something, if she was involved --
dialog: who can say.
dialog: (stands up again)
dialog: But I'll tell you something. She stood
text: in front of these dudes, man. Eyeballing
text: them. Checking them out.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I felt like she was covering my ass that
dialog: day.
text: Unconsciously rubbing his arms where his tattoos are.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I drove her back to Valentine's house.
speaker_heading: <i>FLASH CUT:
text: VALENTINE. Standing in front of his house. His expression
dialog: says: We have something to discuss.</i>
speaker_heading: ED
text: He was standing outside waiting for her.
dialog: That's the only other time I ever saw
dialog: him.
dialog: (a short sad note)
dialog: Last time I saw her.
text: He meets Wilson's gaze. As hard and pointed as a drill
text: through his skull.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. ED'S CAR. NIGHT.
text: Ed drives Wilson back to his motel. Wilson silent. Ed still
text: not quite sure who he's dealing with. Is this really or
dialog: merely a grieving dad?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What you gonna do, man? You gonna go to
dialog: the cops?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Those streets up in the hills, man.
dialog: Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on
text: the ball. Two o'clock in the morning,
dialog: it's dark, your mind is all agitated,
dialog: you're drivin' a little too fast ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Those curves don't kid around.
text: Could be talking about the girl. Wilson doesn't move. But
text: touch him, he'll explode. Out the window lights are passing,
text: but no landmarks. He might as well be on the moon.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You should talk to Elaine. That was her
dialog: best friend.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: She didn't write to me, did she.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: She didn't know what to say.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I thought someone should say something.
dialog: To someone. With me it was, I don't know
dialog: -- Jenny liked me for some reason. I
dialog: felt like I owed her.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass
dialog: or whatever?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (self-conscious again)
dialog: Not me, man. I'm no drug dealer, what
dialog: you think.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (re Ed's tattoos)
dialog: I think you didn't get that lot in the
dialog: Navy, doing your National Service.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I already told you, man. Corcoran. Know
dialog: what that is? State prison.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Nick's a nick, n' it? No matter what
dialog: state you're in. State of remorse, most
dialog: likely -- for gettin' caught.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But that's not me anymore. That's when I
dialog: was into the gang lifestyle. That's not
dialog: who I am now. Five years in the joint --
dialog: that's it for me, man.
text: Now Wilson drops the clanger.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Just got out meself, didn't I.
text: And Ed turns. Looks at Wilson. Fellow ex-con.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. WILSON'S MOTEL. NIGHT.
text: Wilson out of the car, shuts the passenger door. Ed on the
text: other side, looks over the roof at him.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Go home, man.
dialog: (plane taking off in
dialog: background)
dialog: Get on a plane.
dialog: Wilson has other plans.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I'll be needing a shooter.
text: Makes his fingers like a gun. And a clicking sound.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (comes quickly over)
dialog: You're kiddin' me, right?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: What do I do, then, look in the bleedin'
dialog: Yellow Pages?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (an urgent whisper)
dialog: These are not guys you can just go run a
dialog: number on, man.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing
dialog: machines, you know. Bung in your coins,
text: come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
text: Ed throws up his hands, walks back to his driver's side door.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Are you a resident of California?
dialog: You gonna fill out forms, man? Do the
dialog: background check? Go through a three-day
dialog: waiting period?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Sod that. Gotta get back before my
dialog: probation officer wonders where I've
text: skived off to.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Probation? Man, you crazy. They
dialog: shouldn't've let you outta your country,
dialog: much less prison.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
text: Walks round to come face to face with Ed once more.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Which is why I thought, save some time,
dialog: get what I need under the table, like.
speaker_heading: ED
text: As if resigned and mulling the problem over:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Under the table?
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. GUN SHOW. DAY.
text: Hundreds of tables. Under bright lights. Displaying every
dialog: kind of firearm. Handguns, rifles, shotguns, parts to make
text: machine guns. A weapons bazaar.
speaker_heading: WILSON AND ED
text: Walking around. Even a cool customer like Wilson can't help
text: but be impressed by America's loving embrace of senseless
dialog: mayhem.
speaker_heading: DEALERS
text: Touting their wares.
speaker_heading: VISITORS
text: Trying out pistol grips -- or pushing baby carriages. Guys
text: in fatigue jackets with toddlers on their shoulders. Women
dialog: in stretch pants looking for a little something in personal
dialog: protection.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Doesn't know where to look. At the booth featuring "Classic
dialog: Cowboy Collectibles" -- or the most OBESE COUPLE he's ever
text: seen who just walked by.
speaker_heading: PA SYSTEM
dialog: Attention: the long-range vermin-
text: shooting panel is due to commence in two
text: minutes in the blue room at the rear of
dialog: the Convention Center.
text: ... and other anomalous oddball ANNOUNCEMENTS in the
dialog: background as long as we're here.
speaker_heading: DEMONSTRATION
text: At a booth selling laser attachments.
speaker_heading: BEAM SALESMAN
dialog: BeamSight II is easily mountable on any
dialog: shotgun, rifle, or sidearm and will
text: project a small, bright red dot directly
dialog: onto the point where your weapon is
dialog: aimed ...
text: For purposes of display, a smiling YOUNG WOMAN is the
dialog: "target."
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Walking past, almost subliminally noting the Young Woman with
text: the symbol of death on her.
speaker_heading: TABLE
text: A .45 passed from a DEALER's hand to Wilson's.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Man knows what he likes.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (he'll talk if Wilson won't)
dialog: Lookin' good.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: (while Wilson checks)
dialog: That's a high-end item. Total
dialog: reliability.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What'd you call that -- the Protector?
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Yes, sir. Won't find a better CQC on the
dialog: market.
text: Wilson's eyes glance up -- but Ed asks the question.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: CQ what?
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Close Quarters Combat. Keep one in my
dialog: own home.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Trouble is, I'm not at home, see.
dialog: Fancied a bit of target shooting, y'know,
dialog: while I'm here -- with me mate.
dialog: Nods at Ed.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Oh really? Where you from?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: England.
dialog: (sighting the weapon)
dialog: Only, we saw there was a show on, thought
dialog: I might pick something up for a price,
dialog: type of thing.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: You came to the right place, sir. My
dialog: wife's second cousin is English. Well,
dialog: Scotch-Irish. Can I interest you in a
dialog: holster?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Just luck, this, really. Never been to
dialog: one of these before.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: You're in gun country now, my friend.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (picks up another, checks it
dialog: out)
dialog: Been to the Boat Show.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: (re Wilson's new selection)
text: Packs a punch, but it's compact, has
dialog: accessible features -- makes a nice
dialog: concealed-carry piece.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (playing the reluctant buyer)
dialog: He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Don't have time for a lot of paperwork,
dialog: y'know. Just popped over on a quick
dialog: visit.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: I can take care of the paperwork.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: No problem. If you don't have a problem
dialog: with me reporting this gun stolen.
text: A look of understanding between them.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: No. Not at all.
dialog: (to Ed)
dialog: Do we?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Not me, man.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what
dialog: you said -- four hundred for this one?
speaker_heading: DEALERS
dialog: Well, I'll have to add another two
text: hundred on top of that.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Oh, aye?
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: (another look)
dialog: ... for the paperwork.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. ED'S CAR. DAY.
text: Ed drives. Nervous at Wilson handling his new gun purchase
text: beside him.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Violation of my parole, this.
dialog: (a perfect pause)
dialog: -- Goin' abroad.
text: Ed shakes his head at Wilson's sense of humor.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You hadda show up on a weekend. This
dialog: weekend. Wouldn't've even been a gun
dialog: show ... for another month.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Fucking out of order, that. Shouldn't be
dialog: allowed.
text: As he puts away a box of ammo.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Now what. You gonna take your new
dialog: arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just
dialog: like that? Boom bam boom.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: It's only insurance. Can't be too
dialog: careful. This Terry Valentine, he's
dialog: probably a wonderful fella. They were
dialog: together how long?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Five years, I think. Long time.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Well, there you are. Jen must've liked
dialog: him.
dialog: Doesn't make Ed feel any better. Nor does the way Wilson
text: seems now to be studying Ed's driving techniques. Paying
text: attention to the way traffic lights and left-turn lanes and
text: cars without clutches work over here.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: Jenny told me she met him at the beach.
text: Got blinded by his smile.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You believe that shit? Son of a bitch
dialog: never smiled at me. Buried her at a
dialog: "private" service. Private for who.
dialog: Him?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Hang about. I thought you said he come
dialog: into the restaurant where you worked with
dialog: Jenny.
speaker_heading: ED
text: He came in with Jenny to the restaurant
dialog: where I work. That's not where they met.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: And that's where you met Jenny.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, no -- Jenny used to work as a
dialog: waitress. Before she met him. But
dialog: that's not where she met me. Not in my
dialog: restaurant.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: How'd the two of you hook up, then?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR. DAY.
text: Wilson at the wheel himself. Getting the hang of L.A.
text: Driving downtown. Along one of the major boulevards.
text: Glances at a street sign as he goes by. Picks up the map
text: book on the seat beside him to check his route.
scene_heading: EXT. BOULEVARD. DAY.
text: Wilson makes a sudden lane change to avoid getting fed in the
text: wrong direction. Gets HONKED by another driver.
scene_heading: EXT. A STREET DOWNTOWN. DAY.
text: Wilson cruises past a particular building. We don't have to
dialog: really clearly see it just yet (we saw it in the flash cuts) --
dialog: more important we see him seeing it. Casing it with the eyes
text: of a professional. Sniffing it out; the instinct of a
dialog: predator after prey.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. DAY.
text: Parks it. Produces the little leather travel kit we saw him
text: unpack at his motel. Unzips it. Under the usual assortment
text: of clippers, razors, etc., is a hidden layer -- storing still
dialog: more personalized items: a set of select slim
dialog: lockpicking/cutting tools.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET. DAY.
text: Wilson locks the car. Walks away. STAY with him.
scene_heading: AROUND THE CORNER
text: He walks down the block. A nice long walk. What we get out
text: of it besides a sense of Wilson -- cool cat; ambling along;
text: loner; sun beating down; not bothered; his shadow doubling
dialog: him -- is this:
text: The building approaching. The one he has his eye on. The
text: target. It's across the street. A kind of flat windowless
text: warehouse with adjoining loading yard. Loading yard
text: surrounded by a chain-link fence -- topped with barbed wire.
dialog: The actual geography of where he left his car in relation to
dialog: this building. Safely around the corner. And how he might
dialog: practically get back to it, either this same way or via a
text: more circuitous route round another block.
dialog: The sense you get in downtown L.A. on a lazy Saturday
dialog: afternoon that you're in a ghost town. Particularly in this
dialog: shabby kind of industrial section.
text: EXT. THE BUILDING.
text: Wilson crosses over to it now. From sunny to shade.
text: Walks past the chain-link fence. The padlocked gate, big
text: enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within
dialog: the compound.
text: Walks past the closed security door which would appear to be
text: the building's main entrance.
text: Round the next corner -- SEES there's a steel back door as
dialog: well.
text: Comes around this block again. Looking surreptitiously around
text: now. Streets here utterly deserted. Not even a passing car.
text: Crappy residential building on an opposite corner, SPANISH
text: MUSIC blaring from one of the open windows, but not with a
text: direct view on the loading yard fence on this side. Wilson
text: nearing it now -- taking something out of his pocket. One of
text: the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit. Snaps his
text: wrist, unfolding the tool with a CRACK. Wire cutters.
dialog: He doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might have
text: thought. He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the
text: fence meets the adjoining building. SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SNAP,
text: SNAP -- so quick, with great dexterity, though his face
text: grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each
dialog: application of pressure -- he cuts just as many links as he
text: knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll
dialog: under. Whole thing accomplished in seconds.
speaker_heading: LOADING YARD
text: Walks fast to the cover of the trucks. Passes. Looks
text: around. Cement loading docks and bays. Shuttered doors. He
text: jumps up to one, puts his ear to the metal. Listens awhile.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Scans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything.
text: Then cocks an ear upwards... CAMERA CRANING UP to show us
text: what he hears: an air-conditioning unit HUMMING away. Which
dialog: means someone must be inside.
text: Wilson looks back at his entry options. Not the loading
text: doors -- but a conventional door at one end, with a
text: conventional lock his eye zeroes in on. Gets out his tools,
text: going over.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY.
text: A SCRATCHING at the door. It opens. He's in.
text: Waits. Cautious. Nothing. He starts along the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE.
text: A SUPERVISOR (the one from the flash cuts) does a double take
text: as Wilson passes.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Hey!
text: Wilson stops and turns. Says nothing.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: How'd you get in here.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Walked.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: You walked.
dialog: (coming over)
dialog: What the hell are you doing here.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Looking for a bloke named Valentine.
dialog: Know him?
dialog: MEAT PUPPETS (who we saw before as well) who work here
text: gathering. The Supervisor and the Meat Puppets exchange
dialog: glances.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: He's expecting you?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I doubt it.
text: The Supervisor moves toward Wilson.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: So why would he want to see you.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I have a message for him. About Jennifer
dialog: Wilson.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Jennifer Wilson.
text: More looks are exchanged.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: You know her?
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Yeah. I know her, all right. She came
dialog: down here once, stirred up a shitstorm.
dialog: We lost a full day's work, took me weeks
dialog: to get back on schedule. If she hadn't
dialog: a' been Terry's woman I would've broke
dialog: her jaw. 'Course, she's nobody's problem
dialog: now.
text: Wilson stares at him.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Is Valentine here?
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: What do you think?
text: Wilson looks at the Meat Puppets, the loading area.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Where is he, then?
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Listen, get the fuck out of here before
dialog: you get hurt. Who the fuck do you think
dialog: you are, waltzing in here, asking
dialog: questions?
text: Wilson just looks at him.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Do you hear me, asshole?
text: The Supervisor shoves him. The Meat Puppets move a little in
text: anticipation. Wilson isn't giving any indication that he's
text: going to leave.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Jesus, you really want your ass kicked,
dialog: don't you?
text: He pushes Wilson again, hard.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Go on, get outta here.
text: He pushes Wilson again. Still, Wilson won't leave.
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR
dialog: Fuckin' nut. Go on.
text: This time he tries to slap Wilson. Wilson blocks the
text: Supervisor's hand and then punches him, hard. The Supervisor
text: stumbles back and falls to the floor.
speaker_heading: THE MEAT PUPPETS
text: Move to Wilson. He tries to fend them off, but there are too
text: many. They beat him. When they find that he's armed, they
dialog: beat him harder.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING. DAY.
text: Wilson is taken outside and dumped. After a moment, he gets
text: to his feet. Dusting himself. Reaches for ANOTHER GUN tucked
text: in his lower back. He re-enters the building.
text: A beat. We hear several SHOTS.
text: Seconds later, one of the Meat Puppets comes stumbling out of
text: the door, terrified. He runs past us, fast.
text: A moment later, Wilson emerges, gun in hand.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: You tell him. You tell him I'm coming!!
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. DUSK.
text: A series of images that prove Valentine (whoever he is) has
dialog: taste, wealth, and influence, stretching back a good three
dialog: decades at least.
text: Walking through some of these shots is a young beauty in a
text: bathing suit named ADHARA. She advances slowly, not entirely
text: sure of herself, and stops to look at things just like we do.
text: At one point she looks to see a BEEFY GUY (GORDON) sitting at
text: the kitchen counter, flipping through a magazine. He looks
text: her up and down, more from reflex than anything.
text: She continues on. Eventually she emerges through sliding
text: glass doors and on to a patio.
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: A figure by the pool, talking on the phone. His back to us.
text: The pool is spectacular, mosaic tile bottomed.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
text: Approaches, then sits beside him. His voice is soothing, but
text: with the tiniest hint of exasperation that comes with being
text: slightly ahead of everyone.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Not before. Not before. Think about it.
dialog: What does it mean? What -- no, I'm not.
dialog: Think. Yes. See? You figured it out
dialog: all by yourself. I know. Are we done?
dialog: Okay.
text: He hangs up, stands, still doesn't turn.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Adhara. I told your father, if you're
dialog: looking for a name, you can't go wrong
text: with a constellation.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: I used to hate it. Now I like it.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Could be worse, he could've named you
dialog: Reticulum.
text: He turns and we see him for the first time.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Polished. Handsome. Charismatic. Especially when he's
text: smiling like he is now. He leans over and kisses her.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Is there anything in the world that you
dialog: want or need?
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: I want to know why you need that scary
dialog: guy in your house.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Gordon? He's been with me for years.
text: He's not as tough as he looks.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Then what good is he?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Is it possible that you're too young to
dialog: be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Is that a problem?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Not for you, clearly.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Am I a thing?
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Well, you're certainly not a person.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: No. You're not specific enough to be a
dialog: person. You're more like a vibe.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I'm so glad we're having this chat.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: It's not a knock.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: It's not a compliment.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: It's an observation. Like: I'm hungry.
dialog: When are we eating?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: As soon as you get dressed.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: What kind of food?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Anything but Japanese.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I'm not into finger foods. Too fussy.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Like you.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine.
text: Buffets. Salad bars.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: You demand to be served. A fork
dialog: fetishist.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: It's just fuel to me. I'm not there for
text: distractions.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: For some, eating is a sensual experience.
dialog: The sensual experience.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: That's what Gordon's always saying.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Oh, god.
text: His cell phone rings.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes.
text: He listens, then looks up at his balcony, where a MAN (AVERY)
text: stands holding a phone, obviously talking to Valentine.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I'll be there as soon as I can.
text: He hangs up.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE (cont'd)
dialog: We can leave as soon as you're ready.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY. EVENING.
text: Valentine approaches Avery.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: There's been some trouble downtown.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: What kind?
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: What the papers used to call a "gangland
dialog: slaying."
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Our black friends?
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: No, Terry. They don't work like that.
dialog: Jenny Wilson's father paid a little
dialog: visit, left a message.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I thought he was in prison, in England.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Well, either they have a very liberal
dialog: work-release program, or he's out,
dialog: because he's here in L.A., looking for
dialog: you.
text: Valentine is a little ruffled. Maybe Avery likes that.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: What do we do?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: We wait, and we watch.
text: Valentine just looks at him.
scene_heading: EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. POOLSIDE. EVENING.
text: Adhara approaches Valentine, who stands staring at the pool.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Italian?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Italian.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Not who, food. Should we get Italian.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Sure.
text: Turns to her.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE (cont'd)
dialog: Yes. Are you ready?
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: As long as I don't have to pass Gordon
dialog: again. I'm never ready for that.
text: He smiles, rises, and offers her his hand.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: No. I know another way out.
text: She takes it.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING. EVENING.
text: ELAINE on her way in. Handsome woman. Intelligent, capable-
text: looking. Passes Wilson who's leaning somewhere smoking.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
text: Aware as a wary woman will be of a strange man's presence
text: without necessarily having looked at him. Well aware too
text: that he stayed where he was -- so she unworriedly unlocks the
text: building's security gate and goes through to the inner --
speaker_heading: COURTYARD
text: -- and closes the gate behind her, now seeing him amble up,
text: arriving as it CLICKS shut between them. He's looking at her
text: a certain way. She looks back. And knows.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You're Jenny's father.
dialog: And the recognition on his part:
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Had a feeling it was you.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You look alike.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (cigarette in hand)
dialog: Perhaps it was the smoke.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Not her brand.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: She used to pinch 'em off me.
text: (trying to defuse Elaine's cold
dialog: stare)
dialog: Funny that. One thing she never tried to
dialog: get me to stop.
text: Elaine doesn't soften.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Why did you come here?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: No, why did you come here?
dialog: America.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Sort a few things out.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Been busy, have you.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: How d'you mean?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: It's been a while.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I was skint -- didn't have no money to
dialog: get here.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: That's not what I heard.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: What was that, then?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I heard you were -- what's that adorable
dialog: phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: It was the bars, then.
text: Indicating his face, viewed by Elaine through the barred
text: security gate that divides them.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: In any case, I don't suppose the salary
dialog: you make sewing mailbags is really
dialog: commensurate with international airline
dialog: travel.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Sewing mailbags? Me? Never did an
dialog: honest day's work in my life, dear.
dialog: Wasn't about to start when I was in stir --
dialog: not with all that leisure time on my
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: And not with all that buried loot you had
dialog: waiting for you when you got out. From
dialog: the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it? Pink
dialog: Floyd concert receipts. Jenny would've
dialog: been ... fourteen at the time?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (trying to conceal his
dialog: surprise)
text: Hardly buried. Earning interest, love.
text: Earning interest in an offshore account.
dialog: Tidy little premium per annum, that.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Well, that kind of security can't be
dialog: bought. Must be more comforting than a
dialog: daughter to greet you.
text: She turns to walk away.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (without looking back)
dialog: Try calling me again.
scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT. EVENING.
text: She comes in. A modest studio apartment. Puts her bag on
text: the kitchenette countertop. Glances at her answer machine to
text: see if she has any messages. The phone RINGS. She sits down
text: glumly on her couch, holds her head in her hands.
scene_heading: EXT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT BUILDING. EVENING.
text: Wilson gives up, starts to walk away. The gate BUZZES.
scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT. EVENING.
text: Elaine opens the door. Wilson in the hall.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I was just going to toss some vegetable
text: rolls in the microwave, open a can of
dialog: diet soda.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Want to take me out?
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT.
text: Wilson and Elaine at a table.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: ... No, I went in for more improving
dialog: pastimes. Philosophy classes, language
dialog: courses, European history, all that lark.
dialog: Did you know that in Paris in the
dialog: Eighteenth Century there were more rats
dialog: in people's houses than there were people
dialog: in people's houses.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Sounds like Beverly Hills.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Here, are you always this sarky?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Sarcastic, moi? Maybe I'll mellow when
dialog: my ship comes in. It's expected any day
dialog: now. I'm all packed and ready to go.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Weren't you on a television series?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (has he seen it?)
dialog: If it played in England somebody owes me
dialog: money. Who told you that -- Eddie?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (yes)
dialog: Said it went on for donkey's years.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Three seasons. They found that's the
dialog: limit of human tolerance when it comes to
text: following the adventures of a family of
text: Mormons on the Chisum Trail.
dialog: (blinks coquettishly)
dialog: I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Oh, it just ended, then.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Now who's being sarcastic?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: When you've lost as many years as I have,
dialog: love, puts things in perspective, know
dialog: what I mean.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I'm sorry. I guess the rest of us have
dialog: no excuse for wondering where the time
dialog: went.
dialog: (raises her drink)
dialog: It must've been the bars.
text: Their food arrives.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
text: It's a kind of prison, doing a series.
text: Early to bed, early to rise, no time off
dialog: for good behavior, you grab the boodle
dialog: for as long as it lasts.
dialog: (the kicker)
dialog: Only difference is you can't get arrested
dialog: afterwards.
text: Wilson appears fascinated by the cold glasses of water on the
text: table. Ice cubes CLINKING as he holds his. A BUSBOY
text: bringing them to other people, too, just like that, without
dialog: anyone even asking.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I can't believe Jenny told you all that.
dialog: About me. She was always so embarrassed.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Not embarrassed.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (correcting)
dialog: Ashamed.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Not ashamed.
text: Wilson looks at her. Okay. What then.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
text: Disappointed.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: She never told Eddie, though.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: She never told anyone else.
dialog: (making light now)
dialog: About the convict strain -- or is it
dialog: stain? No, I was privileged. I was
text: someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: How'd you manage that, then.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: When I'm not honing my craft in episodic
dialog: television I do double-duty as a voice
dialog: coach. Not that her accent would have
dialog: hobbled her progress. Not with that
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yeah, well, she started all that in
dialog: London.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
text: Modelling.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.
dialog: (putting it on a bit there.
dialog: Then, upper crust:)
dialog: Central School of Speech and Drama.
dialog: It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know.
dialog: At seventeen. They offered her a place
dialog: at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait
dialog: till the next session and she was always
dialog: in hurry to get on, was Jenny. She could
dialog: talk posh without any training, when she
text: was knee-high to a grasshopper.
dialog: (indicating himself)
dialog: Show up the old man, you know.
text: Elaine smiles slightly. None of this information new to her.
dialog: But warming to this man.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You weren't disappointed in her, then.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: In Jenny? 'Course not. How could I be.
dialog: 'Course I wasn't.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: She was twenty-one when she came to me.
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: ... Straight from leaving you.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Footloose and fancy free.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: She was happy here. However the two of
dialog: you might have parted. Don't think she
dialog: wasn't.
dialog: It's because Wilson thinks the opposite that he's here.
text: Looks at Elaine.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: That's the trouble, n' it.
dialog: (hard as nails again)
dialog: She enjoyed life.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEANFRONT. NIGHT.
text: They walk along the seafront. We HEAR the ocean but can't
dialog: see it.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: When did you get in?
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Yesterday. Afternoon.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (occurs to her)
dialog: You haven't been lurking outside my
text: building all day.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: No, I had -- some other matters to attend
dialog: to, you know. Getting a car sorted ...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I might've been away for the weekend.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you
dialog: were goin' out, you'd probably have to
dialog: come home first.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: And you've seen Eddie Rama.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah. Me and him are
dialog: muckers.
text: Mates. Friends. Makes a kind of bonding gesture.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I should really give him a call. He's a
dialog: character, isn't he. Well, not to you.
dialog: I meant to us squares in the outside
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: He give me your address.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I gave him yours. Said, here, you want
dialog: to write, I think this is a relative. I
dialog: guess I thought I was being true to
dialog: Jenny. Who told me she didn't have a
dialog: father -- before proceeding of course to
dialog: tell me why.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Well, don't suppose she did, really, most
text: of her life. On her own after her mum
dialog: died. Aunts and uncles for a time -- and
text: then the bright lights beckoned.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Were you still married at the time -- to
dialog: Jenny's mother, I mean?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Nah, we split up when Jenny was six. Her
dialog: second husband done a runner after she
dialog: got sick. They give me compassionate
dialog: leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in
dialog: hospital. We were always mates, me and
dialog: Jenny's mum. I like to think they're
dialog: together again now. Y'know. Heavenly
dialog: choir.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a
dialog: prison, was it?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Nah, accommodation address.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What's that, like a P.O. box.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Something like that, yeah.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Where you get your bank statements.
text: Wilson gives a laugh.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Well, you gotta have something permanent,
dialog: don'tcha. Even if it's a hole in the
dialog: wall. No matter which jug I might be
dialog: transferred to, I always got someone on
dialog: the out checks up on it for me, see.
dialog: Anything I need to know, comes round on
dialog: visitor's day -- word in my ear.
text: Elaine pauses.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Some word.
text: Wilson leans on the wall overlooking the black ocean. Sound
text: of WAVES gently lapping the beach.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I already knew. Knew beforehand. When
dialog: was it supposed to have happened? -- two
dialog: o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (watching him)
dialog: That's what was estimated.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Eight hours difference between here and
dialog: London. Would've been, what, ten in the
dialog: morning, my time. I was just coming out
dialog: on the yard. Now, I was in the habit of
dialog: saving my newspaper till then. Bit of
dialog: fresh air, stretch me legs -- well,
dialog: stretch the day out, really, that's what
dialog: you wanna do. And I'll tell ya: I
dialog: couldn't open the paper. Could not pry
dialog: the pages apart -- it was like they was
dialog: glued together. That's how weak my hands
dialog: went. Thought I was having heart attack,
dialog: only I knew I wasn't. Bloke come up to
dialog: me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone
dialog: all white. I said, fuck me, I've been in
dialog: prison half my life, what d'ya expect.
dialog: But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel
text: the blood drain right out of me head.
dialog: And I knew ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Something had happened to Jen.
text: They stand here a while. Listening to the BREAKERS hit the
dialog: shore.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.
dialog: They come in.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Make yourself at home. Steal something.
text: That gets her a look.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: There's nothing I can't afford to lose.
text: She goes to make coffee. Wilson looks around.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Well, I gathered something from the
dialog: article what Eddie sent me. Some sort of
dialog: pop music producer, wasn't it.
text: Maybe a smile from Elaine at the quaintness of "pop" music.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Rock n' roll, is what we called it. He's
dialog: sort of a forgotten figure now, but back
dialog: when the West Coast was the grooviest
dialog: place on earth, Terry Valentine was where
dialog: all the happenings happened. More of a
dialog: kind of promoter, I guess, whatever that
dialog: means. Just took that whole Southern
dialog: California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with
dialog: it. Packaged and sold it. Made out like
dialog: a bandit.
scene_heading: <i>FLASH CUTS:
text: VALENTINE. At home. Watching as Adhara undresses, either
text: deliberately for him, or just casually. She smiles as she
text: notices he's looking.</i>
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: What's he done lately.
text: That line pregnant with meaning. Elaine looks at him.
dialog: Avoids answering the question actually implied there.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (brings a tray over)
text: Lives high off the hog and waits for the
dialog: next big thing. Like me -- but on a
dialog: grander scale of failure.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Now, you shouldn't run yourself down. My
dialog: employer, Mr. Lindgren --
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: -- Your employer?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: -- Mr. Lindgren.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Who's Mr. Lindgren?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: My employer.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What line is he in.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Proprietor of a London firm. Of
text: longstanding.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Based in London, but with international
dialog: concerns.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I bet.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Various enterprises, style of thing.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I thought you said you never did an
dialog: honest day's work in your life.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is
dialog: dishonest, exactly.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (she gets the picture)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave,
dialog: never run yourself down, son -- 'cause
dialog: there'll always be plenty of people
dialog: willing to do it for you.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: In what capacity are you employed by this
dialog: Mr. Lindgren?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: This and that. Y'know. Ways and means.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: -- When he wants someone run down, you're
dialog: willing to do it for him.
text: They sort of come together -- in mutual understanding -- and
text: sit down. Coffee steaming.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: So what's the deal. You and Terry
dialog: Valentine at twenty paces. Is that what
dialog: this is about.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Why not.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Are you serious.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Have you ever known me not to be.
text: Elaine looks away:
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: What'd you want me to do. Stay at home,
dialog: twiddlin' me thumbs. Doing sweet F.A.
dialog: [Fuck All].
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You don't believe it was a car accident.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: What do you think.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Terry's never going to give you
dialog: satisfaction. Not the type.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Depends, don' it.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: On what. What makes you so certain.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I'll bloody well ask him.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: There's the phone. You want his number.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: That look again.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I got his number.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Past caring.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I'm not going to help you.
text: She goes into a bathroom. Shutting the door behind her.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Sips coffee. Bites into a cookie.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE. UNDERBRUSH. LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Thickets part and we SEE Wilson scrambling up a rather steep
text: hill. Coming to a ridge where he settles down to look at
text: something O.S. His expression changes by degrees from
text: curiosity to dawning realization to a kind of frustrated
dialog: disappointment.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S CAR (ON THE ROAD BELOW). LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Ed sits in here, RADIO on. Wilson appears out of the brush,
text: gets in. Ed turns the radio down.
speaker_heading: ED
text: (mindful of the odd car driving
dialog: past)
dialog: Told you you wouldn't be able to see
dialog: through that gate.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Gate's open. I had a butcher's at the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: Who'd you butcher at the house?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Butcher's hook. Look.
dialog: (doesn't anyone speak English
dialog: in this fucking country?)
dialog: I don't much reckon those minders of his.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: He's brought in the heavy mob.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Extra muscle. Bodyguards.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Has he?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: They look a right load of wallies.
text: Patrolling back and forth outside the
dialog: gate, all ponced up like the fuckin'
dialog: Household Cavalry.
dialog: (ducks suddenly)
dialog: Watch it.
text: As one of the "bodyguards" runs by, only fleetingly glimpsed
dialog: by us.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That was one of them?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (sits up again)
dialog: See what I mean? Wearing bloomin'
dialog: uniforms n' all.
text: Off Ed's perplexed look ...
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE UNDERBRUSH. LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Wilson settles into position again, this time with Ed.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Look at that.
text: Ed just laughs.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: What's so fucking funny?
speaker_heading: ED
text: Those aren't guards. They're valets.
speaker_heading: POV
dialog: Now we SEE what Wilson had mistaken for Valentine's private
text: army. Half a dozen VALETS outside Valentine's hilltop home.
text: Dressed in matching attire, a couple of them wielding walkie-
dialog: talkies.
scene_heading: RESUME WILSON AND ED
text: Ed's still laughing.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Valets. What d'ya mean valets. What is
dialog: he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
speaker_heading: ED
text: Valets. They park cars. He's having a
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.
text: Wilson's car pulls up. He and Ed get out. Wilson engages in
text: a mini tug-of-war with a Valet over his car key, it so rubs
dialog: him the wrong way having to give it up.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Keep it handy, mate, all right? We're
text: not stopping long.
text: He gestures, apparently getting the message across that he
text: wants the car kept close by.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Cheers.
text: Exchanges the key for a card -- which he turns over in his
text: hand and studies curiously as they head inside.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Valets, eh? Aren't we all la-de-da.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (nervous being here)
dialog: I thought you just wanted to check out
dialog: the house, man.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
speaker_heading: ED
text: No one else is even here yet.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: First in, first out, that's me.
text: Looking over to note the multi-car GARAGE off the main house.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.
text: Wilson and Ed are among the first to arrive. A smattering of
text: other GUESTS. Elaborate catered cuisine. They mosey over to
text: the wet bar.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Gentlemen. What can I get you.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (suggesting Ed take first
dialog: crack)
dialog: Dubonnet with a twist? Baby sham?
dialog: Tomato juice and Tabasco sauce?
text: By now his whole dynamic with Ed is a verbal tease.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (to Bartender)
dialog: Got a Coke?
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S BEDROOM. AFTERNOON.
text: Valentine is checking himself in a full-length mirror. TV on
text: in background, sound low (ENTERTAINMENT WEEK!). Not quite
text: satisfied, Valentine crosses to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
text: Valentine takes one more closer look.
speaker_heading: ADHARA (O.S.)
dialog: You have the same posters.
text: Valentine turns.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: ADHARA
text: Is lounging in the large tub. Staring dreamily at a couple
text: of framed posters on the walls: more 60's psychedelia.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: That you have down at your office.
text: Valentine sits on the edge of the tub. With a nostalgic air
text: as he looks at her: the embodiment of youth.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Different ones.
text: He strokes her wet skin. They kiss lightly.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: I like the colors.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: We all did.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: It must've been a time. A golden moment.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Have you ever dreamed of a place ... you
dialog: don't really recall ever having been
dialog: to ... a place that probably doesn't even
dialog: exist except in your imagination ...
text: somewhere far away, half-remembered when
dialog: you wake up ... but when you were there you
dialog: spoke the language, you knew your way
dialog: around ...
dialog: (significant pause)
dialog: That was the 60's.
text: With that exit line (practiced?), he starts to go.
text: Then pauses, turns again.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: No, it wasn't. Wasn't either.
text: Comes back to her. Faraway look in his eyes.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: It was '66 ... early '67.
dialog: (comes back to now)
dialog: That was all.
dialog: He goes.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY. AFTERNOON.
text: Wilson wanders around, exploring the house. Comes to a wall
text: of photographes. Casually scanning them as he passes slowly
text: by, he's caught up short by one.
speaker_heading: POV
text: A framed photo of JENNY, his daughter.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: A series of emotions play over his face. He turns -- SEES
text: Valentine coming down the stairs. Valentine joins the party
text: without noticing him.
text: BY THE BUFFET TABLE
text: Ed peruses the available food. Valentine comes over to check
text: it out. Glances at Ed without recognizing him.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Hi.
text: And goes away. Leaving Ed more nervous than ever.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. AFTERNOON.
text: Wilson has come up here. Peeks into one room. Moves along to
text: another: the master bedroom. Opens the door gently.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BATHROOM.
text: Adhara is still enjoying her bath.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM.
text: Wilson enters. Careful. Aware that someone's in the adjoining
text: bathroom. The soft RIPPLE of WATER from in there. Perhaps he
text: even glimpses her through the door as he boldly looks around.
text: He notices a video camera on a tripod, a cord running to the
text: television. Suddenly we hear the CHIRP of a cellular phone.
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
text: Adhara reacts.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Shit.
text: She gets out of the tub and goes for the nearest towel.
text: Quickly wrapping herself, she exits.
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
text: Adhara enters and goes for her purse. She pulls the RINGING
text: phone out and answers it.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Hello? Hey! Great. You got my message?
dialog: Yeah. No, Crestview Terrace, not
dialog: Crestview Place. Yeah, there's like three
dialog: different ways up the hill; the quick way
dialog: is to bear to the right. Sure. Okay.
dialog: Okay. 'Bye!
text: She hangs up and begins toweling her hair. After a moment
text: she stops. Something isn't right. She looks around the
text: room, and her eyes stop on the TV. Her brow furrows, trying
text: to place the familiar image on the screen: a girl towel-
text: drying her hair by the bed.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: That's me.
text: She looks over to see the video camera, which has been turned
text: on and pointed toward the bed. She's not sure if it's funny
dialog: or creepy.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. DOWNSTAIRS. AFTERNOON.
text: Valentine mingling, all smiles and movement.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: At the foot of the stairs. Watches him, all stillness and
dialog: intensity.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Catches Wilson's eye for a nanosecond, does a subtle double
dialog: take, then moves on.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. AFTERNOON.
text: Adhara, dressed, looking great, exits the bedroom and heads
dialog: for the stairwell.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. DOWNSTAIRS. AFTERNOON.
text: Adhara descends the stairs.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Turning to SEE her as she comes down.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
text: Makes her way across the room to Valentine.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I'm a gracious host.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Watching them, when --
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Excuse me?
text: Wilson looks at him. Reluctantly.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Don't you work with Ian?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Ian?
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I could swear I met you with Ian at the
dialog: EMI offices in London.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Sorry. Wasn't me.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Unless I'm not who I think I am.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: That's too bad. Ian's got a good thing
dialog: going over there.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Turned that place completely around. 180
dialog: degrees.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: No kidding.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: What I like about Ian, he believes in a
dialog: chain of command, but not a chain of
dialog: respect, you understand what I'm saying?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Right. Chain of respect. That's good,
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Yeah. I really admire the guy. Well.
dialog: Good to meet you.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yeah. Cheers, mate.
text: The Guy leaves. Wilson sees that Adhara is now on the other
text: side of the room, separated from Valentine. He heads for
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Still dealing with people desperate to be the focus of his
text: attention. He notices:
speaker_heading: WILSON AND ADHARA
text: Talking in a corner. She seems attentive.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: In a SERIES OF CUTS, still being the gracious host, still
dialog: keeping his eyes on:
speaker_heading: WILSON AND ADHARA
text: Who, in a SERIES OF CUTS, continue to talk. Finally, they
text: separate, Wilson heading outside onto a deck.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Excuses himself from a group of sycophants and goes to her.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
text: Valentine approaches and begins talking to her, low. After a
text: few moments of conversation, they both look toward:
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: On the deck outside. Joining Ed, who's taken refuge out here
text: with a plate of food. What Wilson can't belleve when he SEES
text: it -- is that behind Valentine's house, which is on top of a
text: high hill, is nothing but desolate scrub canyon. On the other
text: side of the railing around the deck, which is surely less
text: than regulation height, is a sheer drop into an abyss.
speaker_heading: WILSON (cont'd)
dialog: (jumps back with only slightly
dialog: affected vertigo)
text: Flipping heck.
text: Ed, a little more accustomed to L.A. architecture, nods in
dialog: agreement.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: If you could afford a house like this you
dialog: would buy a house like this.
text: Wilson edges forward to the rail again.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: What are we standing on?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Faith.
dialog: They stand there looking out. Quite a view once you get used
text: to it. Breeze.
speaker_heading: ED (cont'd)
dialog: (nods to the hazy distance)
dialog: You could see the sea from here if you
text: could see it.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Could you?
text: But now Ed gives Wilson a nudge -- SEEING that Valentine
text: inside the house is making his way out here.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Why don't you go nick one of those little
dialog: cooker what's its warming up the sausages
dialog: cocktail and meet me in the garage. Look
dialog: about for a toolbox while you're at it.
dialog: Ed considers. His is not to reason why.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay.
text: Ed moves off. Valentine steps up, smile fully loaded.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Hi. Terry Valentine.
text: He extends his hand. Wilson shakes it.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Pleasure.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Have we met? There's something I can't
dialog: quite --
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: EMI in London. I work with Ian.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: You must know Ian.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Great bloke. Really turned things around
text: there. 180 degrees.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I suppose that's good, unless things were
dialog: fine the way they were.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Oh, I think a shake-up was in order.
dialog: Definitely. Otherwise, people get lazy,
dialog: don't they? Forgetful. Start thinking
dialog: they can get away with things. Gotta
dialog: shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay
dialog: attention.
text: Wilson looks at him. Valentine looks back. Something about
dialog: those eyes ...
speaker_heading: EXCITED GUY
dialog: Terry, Terry ...
text: The Excited Guy appears, tugging at Valentine.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Glad I got to meet you.
speaker_heading: EXCITED GUY
dialog: Ter ... Ter ... you gotta ...
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Thanks. You, too.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Be seein' you.
text: The Excited Guy ushers Valentine away. Wilson watches him
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: EXCITED GUY
dialog: Charles Grodin is here.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S GARAGE. AFTERNOON.
text: Ed, waiting. Wilson enters.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Got it?
text: Ed displays the Sterno.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Toolbox?
text: Ed points to a table, where a toolbox sits. Wilson crosses
text: to it, begins going through the contents.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Put the Sterno on the ground, near the
text: center of the garage.
text: Ed does. Wilson pulls a brace-and-bit from the toolbox and
text: crosses to the rear of one of the cars. Dropping to the
text: ground, he bores a hole in the gas tank. Ed raises his
text: eyebrows and moves toward the door. Wilson crosses to the
text: other car and puts a hole in that gas tank as well. Then he
text: puts the brace-and-bit back in the toolbox and heads for the
text: exit, Ed right behind him, giving a quick backward glance.
speaker_heading: THE GASOLINE
text: Spills out, slowly but steadily, and slithers toward the
text: garage door.
scene_heading: EXT. BETWEEN VALENTINE'S HOUSE AND GARAGE. AFTERNOON.
text: Wilson and Ed walk briskly along the path.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (gives Ed parking ticket)
dialog: Bring the motor around. Bang out in
dialog: front, right?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You goin' back inside?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: One thing I need.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. DOWNSTAIRS. AFTERNOON.
text: Valentine is talking to Gordon, his beefy bodyguard, and
text: looking around. He stops as he sees Wilson once again
text: stepping onto the deck. He points Wilson out to Gordon, who
text: nods and heads for the deck.
scene_heading: EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.
text: Ed hands the ticket to a Valet. He exchanges looks with a
text: couple of the other Valets.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. DOWNSTAIRS. AFTERNOON.
text: Valentine is talking to Adhara, who is introducing her
text: Girlfriend. As Valentine greets her, he glances outside
text: where Gordon is approaching Wilson on the deck.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK.
text: Wilson SEES Gordon approaching. Gets ready to greet him.
text: Removes cigarette from mouth, drops it to floor of deck,
text: presses it out under his shoe. Limbers up his shoulders in a
dialog: subtle way.
text: Gordon coming towards him. As if to challenge Wilson's
text: legitimacy as an invited guest. Closer. About to speak.
text: But Wilson doesn't even give him a chance to do that. In
text: quick succession: Wilson HEAD BUTTS Gordon, splintering his
text: nose; KNEES him in the groin; then, using the knee for
text: leverage, grabs Gordon by the lapels -- and heaves him over
dialog: the railing!
dialog: It happened so fast that if anyone else is nearby they
dialog: probably didn't even notice -- or didn't readily grasp what
dialog: they saw.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.
text: Valentine had turned his attention back to Adhara and her
text: Girlfriend. When he glances back to the deck he's a little
dialog: concerned not to see Gordon anywhere out there anymore --
text: just Wilson coming back in.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Adjusting his jacket, walking back through the house. Behind
text: him, people are rushing to the railing and looking over. A
text: few yells of "Call an ambulance!" etc. are heard.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Moves that way.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Moving across the room towards the front door. They are
text: heading right toward each other.
scene_heading: WILSON AND VALENTINE
text: Pass each other, eyes locked, almost dream-like. Wilson's
text: eyes cold, though with the hint of a smile. Valentine throws
text: a last look back before reaching the deck.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK.
text: Valentine pushes through to look over the railing.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Gordon -- a crumpled, inert heap way down the hill below.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Turns to look toward the front door. Wilson not to be seen.
text: Valentine pushes through the crowd toward the door.
scene_heading: EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.
text: Valentine emerges in time to see Ed and Wilson pulling away.
text: Wilson looks at him, impassive, through the passenger window.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Is just arriving in his car. Valentine gestures at him.
text: Suddenly we HEAR a loud, bass-heavy WHHUUUMMMPPP.
text: Valentine (and a few others) turn toward the sound, which
dialog: came from:
speaker_heading: THE GARAGE
text: There is smoke coming from under the door.
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON ROAD. AFTERNOON.
text: Wilson's car practically tobogganing back down the hill.
text: BOOM! We hear an explosion from back UP the hill.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S CAR.
text: Ed jumps -- though he's driving. The gas pedal his most
text: pressing concern. Negotiating the dangerously winding road
text: comes second. Exhilaration mixed with panic.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Steady on.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You steady on, man. What the fuck else
dialog: did you do back there.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD.
text: An especially sharp curve looms ahead.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Flinches, grabs a handhold.
speaker_heading: CURVE
text: Car makes it around on two side wheels.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Gulps.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Bloody hell.
text: Ed regains control.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: In his car, takes a different turn.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD. CAR.
dialog: Swerves some more curves. Should be some sense here that a
dialog: similar skyline route would have been taken by Wilson's
text: daughter on her final drive.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S CAR.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why didn't you just kill him, you had the
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: That would be too easy.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Too easy?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: He's gotta know why.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You think a fuckin' guy like that ever
dialog: will? What more do you want, man?
text: Suddenly out of nowhere -- (a side street) -- BAM! -- another
text: car shoots out to cut them off, sideswiping them.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD.
text: Wilson's car SKIDS into a spin from the impact.
speaker_heading: THE OTHER CAR
text: It's Avery. Chased them via a shortcut down the mountain.
text: Now jumps out of his car, levels a shotgun at them and pumps
text: off a BLAST.
speaker_heading: WILSON'S CAR
text: BAM! -- the trunk pops open as the car rights itself. Avery
text: FIRES again, but the upended trunk is a kind of shield,
text: deflecting the shot.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S CAR.
text: Despite the fact that Ed is still in the driver's seat (and
dialog: managed rather skillfully to avoid crashing) -- Wilson acts
text: like he's not there, grabs the steering wheel, jams the car
text: into reverse, virtually sitting on Ed as he pounds his own
text: foot onto the gas pedal -- and with his ferocious eyes
text: monitoring the door-mirror, steamrolls the car backwards
text: towards Avery.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD.
text: Wilson reverses his car like a speeding tank: SMASHING into
text: Avery's car. Pushing it right off the edge of the road.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Falls backwards to the ground as he gets the hell out of the
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Jumps out of his car. Gun drawn. Advancing on Avery with it
dialog: pointed.
speaker_heading: AVERY'S CAR
text: CRASHING through underbrush down the steep bank of the
text: hillside.
speaker_heading: WILSON'S FACE
text: SOUND of the divebombing car OVER. Another pointed echo of
dialog: his daughter's fate.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Their eyes meet momentarily. And before Wilson can shoot,
text: Avery rolls over the edge of the road himself.
speaker_heading: ED
text: Calls frantically to Wilson from their car.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: C'mon, man! C'mon!
text: SIRENS in the distance.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: That consuming rage overtaken him again for a second. But
text: the exigencies of the moment snap him out of it.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Turns on a dime, goes back to the car. Before he's halfway
text: in, Ed's driving them away again. Trunk at the back BANGING
text: up and down, up and down.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Pulls himself back up to the road. Brushing himself off.
dialog: Looking the way they went.
text: He gently tosses his shotgun down into some thick brush where
dialog: maybe he'll retrieve it later.
scene_heading: EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.
text: Avery returns, sweating, walking back up the road to where
text: all the action is. Party guests milling outside, waiting for
text: their cars so they can leave. A fire truck, a police car.
text: SMOKE pouring out of Valentine's garage.
text: Valentine finishes talking to a couple of COPS. Walks over to
dialog: Avery.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: You should have let me do the talking.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Why, because you're my security
dialog: consultant?
dialog: (insecure)
dialog: This cocksucker nearly burnt my house
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: (more concerned about police
dialog: presence)
dialog: What did you tell them.
text: Valentine blows air, runs a hand through his hair.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I told them a long-time employee flipped
dialog: out. Had a drug problem, refused
text: counselling. Set the garage on fire,
dialog: then committed suicide. One of my
dialog: "guests" tried to stop him -- but how do
dialog: you stop Gordon.
dialog: In this context meaning how did that rangy Englishman do it.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four
dialog: hundred pounds.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Heavier than that now. But are there any
dialog: drugs in that stomach to back up your
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: As it happens. I didn't make that part
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: And where is this guest? Don't they want
dialog: to interview him.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I don't know everyone here. He was so
text: traumatized he split.
dialog: (another notion)
dialog: Maybe he was Gordon's pusher.
text: Avery stares at Valentine. Impressed at him thinking on his
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Where do you think he is, Mike.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: (already turning)
dialog: We'll find him.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: (stops him)
dialog: No. I mean. Not even your people should
dialog: be involved. Right? It's too close now.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: You could use a few of my prime
dialog: shitkickers up here.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: You think I'm staying?
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: There's already gonna be talk about how
dialog: people close to you keep falling into
dialog: canyons.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Well, can we make it one more. Nowhere
dialog: the fuck near me.
text: He's being glib, but he's being serious. His open-handed
dialog: gesture inquiring of Avery: are you up to the task?
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: I have other resources.
text: He turns to go.
scene_heading: EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. CANYON. AFTERNOON.
text: The huge dead bulk of Gordon hoisted back up to the deck by a
dialog: paramedic team.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.
text: Valentine comes back in. In the living room beyond, Adhara
text: stands anxiously, where she's been waiting for him. Cops
text: visible outside on the deck, peering over the edge.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Heading that way. Then stops. Backtracks. Something
text: peripherally had caught his eye and he returns to it. His
text: wall of photographs.
speaker_heading: AN EMPTY FRAME
text: The one that had contained the picture of Jenny.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S CAR. AFTERNOON.
text: Safely down the hill. Driving away in traffic, Ed calmer
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Pulls the rolled-up photograph of his daughter out of his
text: jacket and looks at it.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. POOL HALL. NIGHT.
text: Two characters stand, leaning, against a back wall. Staring
text: ahead, without purpose. Halfheartedly watching a game of
text: pool in progress. Just hanging out. Strange, threatening
text: characters. One of them is young. Lean, hungry-looking.
text: STACY is his name. A shrewd, scheming kid. But definitely a
text: little unhinged. Weirder is his companion. UNCLE JOHN. The
dialog: title isn't one of courtesy. He's an actual blood relative.
text: Maybe 25 years older than Stacy. But intellectually younger.
text: Physically, much bigger. The man is huge. Nevertheless, the
text: safer of the two -- until Stacy tells him otherwise. Way
text: they're standing next to each other suggests the ease they
dialog: feel in each other's company. Tight bond. They're good
dialog: buddies.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Walks in. Stops to look around. Spots his two freaks.
text: Walks toward them.
speaker_heading: DOORWAY
text: A mysterious black man has followed Avery in. THOMPSON is
text: his name. He hangs back and watches.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Makes contact.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Stacy.
text: Stacy turns to see him. Uncle John looks vacantly.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (bored)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Come over here.
text: That was in the way of an order. He nods around the corner
text: where it's less crowded. Stacy stops Uncle John from
text: following, and goes after Avery.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
text: At the bar. Keeping his eye on them.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Speaks softly. Alone with Stacy.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: How they goin', kid?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Not bad.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: How'd you like to kill someone for me?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Okay.
text: Avery gives him an envelope.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Same as last time -- the rest after.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (pockets it)
dialog: Where do we go?
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: When you find the guy, you'll know.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: What shit is this. I just do it. I
dialog: don't prepare it.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: I'll point you in the right direction,
dialog: but you'll have to take it to the end-
dialog: zone. He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I
text: figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: This is un-fucking professional.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: See, a successful man like me has
dialog: limitations -- I lose touch at a street
dialog: level. So I have to depend on a smart
dialog: boy like you who's closer to the nitty
dialog: and the gritty than I am.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is.
dialog: This is a lifestyle I embrace.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: That's why I'm letting you take care of
dialog: this. I'm the one with appearances to
dialog: maintain. But who gives a shit about
dialog: you? Not even God.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S MOTEL. NIGHT.
text: Wilson on the bed. Watching TV (ACCESS HOLLYWOOD!). KNOCK
text: at door. He turns down the TV. Takes a .45 from the springs
text: under the bed. Looks carefully through the peephole in the
dialog: door.
text: Opens it. Elaine has come to visit. Lets her in. After
text: closing the door resumes his position on the bed.
text: Elaine looks around.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I was in the neighborhood. I come down
dialog: here quite a bit. Watch the planes
text: taking off.
dialog: (re this motel)
dialog: Study the architecture of early David
dialog: Lynch.
text: But she doesn't really have it in her to be ironic right now.
text: Leans back against the door.
text: Wilson remains silent. He's done the same to Elaine now that
text: he did to Ed. Almost magically induced her to a confessional
dialog: verge.
text: Elaine, too, isn't sure she wants to be complicit in this
dialog: revenge tragedy. But here goes:
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Jenny was supposed to come to my place
dialog: that night. She called me, asked if she
dialog: could come over. She and Terry had been
dialog: -- having some trouble. Lately. I don't
dialog: know about what. On this occasion, it
text: reached some sort of crisis point.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: She told you all about my details but not
dialog: about his. Lovely.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: She'd never called me like that before.
dialog: She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry --
dialog: than upset or afraid. But she never
dialog: turned up. I called the house but only
dialog: got the answer machine. When they found
dialog: her ... she'd been going the wrong way.
dialog: Not the direction she'd have gone if
dialog: she'd been coming to see me. Or coming
dialog: straight to see me. Who knows. Maybe she
dialog: just wanted to drive.
dialog: She looks at Wilson. Shrugs. That's it. That's all. Isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (measured)
dialog: How did you come to have my address?
dialog: Found it, did you. Among her things.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You think Terry gave me access to her
dialog: things? Probably sold her clothes.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (gently urging)
dialog: And how did you get it?
text: Elaine looks at him.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: She gave me your address.
text: Wilson nods.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (cont'd)
dialog: (starting to realize)
dialog: Not long before ...
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: She said if anything ever happened ...
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: That's how you know. That's why you're
dialog: so sure.
dialog: (realization)
dialog: Jenny's telling you.
text: She's sitting on the bed now.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. MEAN STREET. NIGHT.
text: Stacy, putting on a jacket that says "Bomb Hanoi" comes out
text: of the pool hall. Uncle John in tow.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: How much.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Five thousand.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (taps pocket)
dialog: I got half.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: Makin' trouble for someone?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: Which kind?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: The forever kind.
speaker_heading: BEHIND THEM
text: Thompson, the mysterious black man, watches them from the
text: hall doorway.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. WILSON'S MOTEL. MORNING.
dialog: Early.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S ROOM.
text: Wilson and Elaine. Getting dressed. She's in pantyhose.
text: Fastening a bra. He's got trousers on, reaching for a shirt.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: How long've you lived here?
text: Elaine sits on the bed, fastening her skirt. Her bra strap
text: cuts across her bare back.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: This town's been chewing my flesh
dialog: since ... what we now refer to as "the
dialog: early 70's."
dialog: (thinks back)
dialog: Christ, my past became nostalgia and no
dialog: one even asked me.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Early 70's. I was away.
dialog: (tries to remember)
text: Maidstone. Possibly Brixton.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: These more highlights from the Zagat
dialog: prison guide?
text: Wilson looks at her: she's the one who goes to bed with ex-
dialog: cons.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: You don't seem bothered.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You don't know how I've compromised my
dialog: standards.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Tell us about it.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: It's too involved; a lifetime of non-
dialog: involvement. Anywhere else I'd be an
dialog: interesting little number, here I'm just
dialog: SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Oh, I was gonna say ...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Still, there have been rewards. It's
dialog: sunny. And some of the producers who
dialog: call even have credits.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I can see the attraction.
text: She glances up at him to try and see how he means that. Is
text: he looking at her or out the window?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What did you do? To make them take the
dialog: early 70's away from you.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: A jeweller's up the West End. We
text: tunnelled our way under the shop floor
text: from the public lavatory down the road.
dialog: Filthy work. Trouble was, the bloody
dialog: thing collapsed -- after we'd made the
dialog: grab, 'n all. Would you Adam n' Eve it.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You mean if they'd nabbed you before you
dialog: actually broke and entered you would only
dialog: have been charged with making a mess.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: We were lucky to be nicked. Me and the
dialog: lads went down there Sunday evening, we
dialog: weren't discovered till the Monday. Good
dialog: job we were still breathing.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: It didn't discourage you, though.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Hey?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: From pursuing your chosen profession.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I'll tell ya something: it made me a
dialog: model prisoner. Put me right off any
dialog: escape attempts. Tunnel my way to
dialog: freedom after that experience? Not
dialog: bloody likely.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
text: I was inside once. I punched a cop at a
dialog: demo.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Did you. What was that in aid of?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Who remembers.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Get seven years, did you?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Overnight. What about just now?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Just now?
text: (playful, goes over, ready for
dialog: more)
dialog: Overnight?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You have been away.
text: (lies back, regards him
dialog: carefully)
dialog: Or is all this just new to you?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: It's true. Has to be said. I got off to
text: a slow start.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I don't believe it.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Honest. Didn't know where to look till I
dialog: was 21.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
text: Pushing the legal limit even then.
text: He stands again, vaguely disappointing her.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Me mate introduced me to a woman up the
dialog: street. Funnily enough, she was married
dialog: to a milkman. Straight up. I said,
dialog: "Good is she? Been around?" He said,
dialog: "Good? Listen, mush, it's not that she's
dialog: been around, it's that she's been around
dialog: hell of a long time."
text: He laughs uproariously at that. But the point is: he's sort
dialog: of complimenting both Elaine and himself. They've been
dialog: around, had their knocks, they've lasted. Elaine remains
text: unsmiling.
text: Still leaning back on her elbows on the bed, in bra, skirt,
text: hose, no shoes. She asks again the question Wilson avoided
dialog: answering.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Your most recent incarceration. What was
dialog: that for?
text: And again he evades the answer she wants.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: It was for nine years.
dialog: (buttoning his shirt)
dialog: The last nine years.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY. MORNING.
text: For the first time, we see the Pacific coastline. Impressive.
text: And a sleek Italian sports car. Heading north.
scene_heading: INT. SPORTS CAR.
text: Valentine at the wheel. Adhara besides him.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've
dialog: never done this drive.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: All your life. That happened while I
dialog: swam the length of my pool.
text: Adhara looks back over her shoulder. Checking the road
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Nothing. I guess it's hard to pass on
dialog: this road.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain
dialog: majesty.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
text: Just feels like the car behind has been
dialog: following us the longest time.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I sure hope so.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAR BEHIND.
text: A big utility vehicle. With Avery in the front passenger
text: seat. And three bodyguards he's brought along to protect
text: Valentine. RICK driving, TOM and LARRY in the back.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: All I'm sayin' is travel time shouldn't
dialog: be the same rate. Travel time is down
dialog: time, right? I mean, we're not even in
text: the same car as the client.
dialog: (to Avery)
dialog: You told me the job was at the house.
dialog: When we get to it. Well, are we shadowing
dialog: the client right now or are we just going
dialog: the same way? The company I was with in
dialog: Seattle, these distinctions were made.
dialog: Now, I don't dispute him getting the full
dialog: whack.
dialog: (he means Rick, who's older)
dialog: Seniority and all that. But if I'm
dialog: getting paid the same hourly rate when
dialog: we're at the house as I am in this car,
dialog: that doesn't sit well with me and I feel
dialog: obliged to say so. 'Cause in Seattle
dialog: what you're paying now for so-called
dialog: travel time was half what we got for
dialog: actual clock-time with the client. So I
dialog: just feel we should get more when the job
text: actually commences.
text: After this spineless whining weak-willed sob story, Larry
text: just turns to him and says:
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: ... I'd really like to eat your pussy.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. ELAINE'S NEIGHBORHOOD. DAY.
text: Stacy and Uncle John sitting on a bench in a beach setting
text: (though we still don't see the ocean). Or on some grass,
text: maybe, in a little park -- opposite Elaine's building.
text: People-watching. In their own unique way. Stacy commenting
text: on fellow humanity all around them. TIME CUTS between each
dialog: comment:
speaker_heading: STACY
text: (after laughing loudly at a
dialog: handicapped person)
dialog: I believe in mocking the afflicted. Good
dialog: for 'em. Makes 'em stronger.
text: Uncle John picks at the grass or sand. As they kill the day.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (spotting a woman with a dog)
dialog: Ever take a look at the women who work in
dialog: pet stores? Wow.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (as a fat jogger passes)
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (watching someone else go by)
dialog: Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: (barely out of earshot of a
text: black woman with dyed blonde
dialog: hair)
dialog: Very attractive. Good idea. Now I
dialog: really want to fuck you.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: (after a long time in silence,
dialog: just staring at someone)
dialog: ... you can always tell the ones who'll do
dialog: anal.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (regarding some other
dialog: beachgoers)
dialog: Kinda makes you wonder why more people
dialog: don't put a bullet through their fuckin'
dialog: skulls, doesn't it.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (reading a newspaper)
dialog: Looks like they just airbrushed the dick
text: out of his mouth.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (leaning back on his elbows)
dialog: Why don't they have TV shows about people
dialog: whose daily lives you'd be interested in
dialog: watching. Y'know. Like SKINNY LITTLE
scene_heading: WEAKLING. Or BIG FAT GUY. SICK OLD MAN.
text: FAMILY OF LOSERS. Wouldn't that be good?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (sitting up)
text: Two blacks and a Mexican in a car. Who's
dialog: driving?
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: STACY
speaker_heading: The L.A.P.D.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (observing a "fast-walker")
dialog: Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's really
dialog: healthy.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: (his gaze following another
dialog: unfortunate)
dialog: Can't you do something about your ass?
speaker_heading: STACY
text: (his head turning after someone
dialog: else)
dialog: Other people's lives scare the shit out
dialog: of me.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: (watching some guy rooting in a
dialog: trash bin)
dialog: "Homeless" people. Fuck them. Remember
dialog: when they were just bums? Everyone with
dialog: an axe to grind. Like to grind in their
dialog: face. Pretty soon there'll be shit-in-
dialog: your-pants rights groups. Stupidity
dialog: activists.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (glad he's who he is and not
dialog: who he's looking at)
dialog: Wonder what it's like being a dumb guy in
text: a dumb suit trying to cross the street.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: (staring at another sad couple)
dialog: Life sure is a minefield.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (clocking another female)
dialog: Look at that one. She's really been
dialog: used.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (in a contemplative mode)
dialog: I'd love to be famous so I could snub
dialog: ordinary people. Imagine, you're famous,
dialog: you're sitting in a restaurant, some fool
dialog: comes up to you, wants you to sign your
dialog: name on his napkin, his wife is there, it
dialog: would be something these poor saps would
dialog: cherish the rest of their lives, talk
dialog: about to their cretin friends. Bam! You
dialog: tell 'em to FUCK OFF! God, I'd love
dialog: that.
text: Suddenly Uncle John speaks.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: Is that her? I bet that's her.
text: Stacy turns.
speaker_heading: POV
text: Across the street, Elaine comes out of her building. (We're

dialog: street, or only street parking.)
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. SOME STREET. DAY.

scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S CAR.

text: An "8x10" of Elaine on their back seat. Another picture of

speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: Maybe she doesn't even know the English
dialog: guy.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (driving)
dialog: Avery said she was tight with his
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: That don't mean nothin'.
text: Stacy knows better than to argue with a moron.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: She's nice lookin'.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: So what.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: I dunno. I just said she's nice lookin'.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: And I said so what. You think she's any
dialog: happier?
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: What d'you mean, any happier?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Any happier than any other asshole in

speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. SOUND STUDIO. DAY.
text: On screen: A BEAUTIFUL MODEL -- but speaking in ELAINE'S
speaker_heading: VOICE.
speaker_heading: ELAINE

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY.

speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. SOUND STUDIO. DAY.

speaker_heading: ELAINE

dialog: One thing I can't do is English.
dialog: Americans can't. Shouldn't even try.
dialog: And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: You ever been to London?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Only in the movies.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I've 'ardly ever left it.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Yeah, well, you're here now --
dialog: (re Wilson's accent)
dialog: -- where hurricanes hardly ever happen.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I've got the hang of the driving. Found
dialog: this place all right.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Stick with me, kid. Looks big when you
dialog: get here but you can cover it in five
dialog: minutes.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (cont'd)
dialog: So, is there anybody in your family who's
dialog: not a criminal?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Not that I recall.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What about your grandmother?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Nah -- she was married to me grandad --
text: he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to
text: make knuckle-dusters down the shop.
dialog: Crafty old sod.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: He alive to see this?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (shakes head)
text: Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon,
text: Muswell Hill. Watching Doris Day.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What'd your father do?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Black market during the war.
text: Elaine shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I guess you're just habitual.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: You sound like my fucking probation
dialog: officer.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Won't he be looking for you about now?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Good luck to him. He couldn't find his
dialog: prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Minor officials bother you, don't they?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Do us a favor. Can't even go have a

scene_heading: EXT. ELAINE'S BUILDING. DAY.

speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. ELAINE'S BUILDING. DAY.
text: Wilson and Elaine turn the corner into the corridor
text: approaching her apartment door. Pause to kiss. Walk closer.
text: And Stacy appears at the other end of the hall. Both arms
text: stretched out with the .38 at the end of them.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Hi, kids.
text: Starts to squeeze off a shot. As Wilson pushes Elaine to the
text: floor. As another SHOT rings out from further along the hall
text: behind Stacy. Catching him across the cheek. Only skimming
text: him. But knocking him down. Bullet chipping the wall.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
text: Across from Stacy. Freezes, his own gun in hand.
scene_heading: AT THE STAIRS
text: Three BLACK GUYS. Including Thompson. They approach. Guns
text: pointed at Stacy and Uncle John.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Hand on his .45 now. But a fourth Black Guy coming up behind
text: him. Wilson lowers the .45.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
text: Flattened herself back against a wall. Petrified.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: Sits on the floor. Holds his hurt face. Thompson walks over
text: and picks up Stacy's gun. One of the other blacks relieves a
dialog: reluctant Uncle John of his.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: (stops at Wilson)
dialog: Come with us.
dialog: If there's any doubt whether Wilson will -- one of the blacks
text: gently puts the muzzle of a gun to Elaine's head. Cocks the
dialog: hammer.
text: They all go off down the stairwell. Except Stacy and Uncle
dialog: John.
text: Hit men wondering what hit them.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM. DAY.
text: Like Wilson's motel room, another version of a cell.
text: A small window, high up. Bricks and debris around the floor.
text: And Wilson and Elaine. Sitting, leaning against opposite
text: stone walls.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Tell me you wouldn't prefer a steady
dialog: income.
text: Wilson takes a cigarette pack from a pocket. Lights himself
text: one. Then tosses the stuff over to Elaine.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (lights up)
text: A leech on the welfare state in addition.
dialog: You don't miss a trick.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I fiddle it. They got me down as an
dialog: immigrant with five kids.
text: Elaine sort of shares a laugh at that.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Yeah ... Jenny spoke fondly of her
dialog: imaginary siblings.
dialog: Though real ones might have been nice. This an unspoken
dialog: thought between them.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (cont'd)
dialog: Do you remember the last time you saw
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Last time might as well've been the
dialog: first. I remember all the times, don't
dialog: I. Watching her grow up --
dialog: (finding the word)
text: in increments.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: She told me you were a ghost in her life.
dialog: Daddy the friendly ghost. Coming back to
text: haunt her.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Well, she twigged by the time she was
dialog: eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the
dialog: Royal Marines or doing scientific
dialog: research in the jungles of Borneo or
dialog: playing Iago in a worldwide tour of
speaker_heading: OTHELLO.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Still, you could never ... do what she
dialog: wanted.
text: Wilson shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: She used to tell me she'd turn me in.
dialog: (tries to laugh about it)
dialog: Little kid. Ten year old. "If you're
dialog: naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya." She
dialog: didn't want me sent down again, see.
dialog: When I was planning some job. "I'll tell
dialog: 'em, Dad, I promise I will. Here, look,
dialog: I'm calling the Old Bill right now" --
text: picking up the telephone. I can see her,
text: the phone in her hand. Became a sort of
dialog: joke between us. Only it wasn't a joke.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: She never would have turned you in, not
dialog: in a million years.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I know that. But as time went on ...
dialog: well, it wasn't a joke, was it? She had
dialog: a feeling about it -- about the last job
dialog: -- how long I'd get the hook for. Said
dialog: she wouldn't be there this time when I
dialog: got out.
text: DOOR opens. Thompson. Gun in hand.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. DAY.
text: Thompson leads Wilson past a row of windows. Dockyards,
text: harbor activity outside. Toward a door with things
text: stencilled on it. One of them: US DEPT. OF CUSTOMS.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE.
text: A man named FEATHER. Black. Half sitting on the edge of a
text: table. Wilson is shown in.
text: Wilson at the door. Sizes Feather up at a glance.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: This is where I come in.
text: He walks confidently in. Outside, through the window, an
text: image of a foreign sports car being hoisted in the air by a
dialog: crane.
text: There's a chair. Wilson sits in it.
text: Feather squints a little. Seems ready to listen to whatever
dialog: Wilson has to say.
speaker_heading: WILSON (cont'd)
dialog: How's it going, squire, all right? Now
dialog: listen -- when I was in the nick --
dialog: second time, it was -- no, third. Third
dialog: stretch, yeah. There was this screw had
dialog: it in for me. That geezer was top of my
dialog: list. Two years after I was slung, I saw
text: him. He was sitting on a bench in
dialog: Holland Park. There was no one else
dialog: about. I coulda gone up behind him and
dialog: snapped his fucking neck. But I left it.
dialog: Coulda nobbled him, but I didn't. 'Cos
dialog: what I thought I wanted wasn't what I
dialog: wanted. What I thought I was thinking
dialog: about was something else. This berk on
dialog: the bench wasn't worth my time. See what
dialog: I mean? It didn't matter. It meant sod
text: all in the end.
text: Feather has been listening to this, expressionless. Now he
text: raises a finger as if there's a point he wants clarified.
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: There's one thing I don't understand.
dialog: (wants to make this clear)
dialog: The thing I don't understand ... is every
dialog: motherfucking thing you're saying.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I
dialog: can see that, I'm on your manor now,
dialog: right. So there's no need to get out of
dialog: your pram. I'm Johnny-come-lately to all
dialog: this. Whatever the bollocks between you
dialog: and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing
dialog: to do with me. I don't wanna know.
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: Well, I'll tell you. I believe this
dialog: Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I can well believe it. I'm sure he has
dialog: done, son. He's about as straight as a
text: dog's hind leg.
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: But I can't be sure. I don't even know
dialog: who he is. He's too insulated. Too many
text: layers around him.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Your guess is as good as mine, mate. I'm
dialog: here on another matter entirely.
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: (moves to window)
dialog: Yeah, I guess you are.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Good job your lot showed up when they did
dialog: or it would've been me for the high jump.
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: That dude who works for Valentine. He's
dialog: the one sent those guys after you. You
dialog: know that.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yeah. Shouldn't wonder. Must've done.
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: So what's your beef, pal?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Nothing financial. Strictly personal.
dialog: (moves to window)
dialog: I can see how all this import-export
dialog: malarkey might give rise to confusion
dialog: where I'm concerned. A foreigner,
text: showing up unexpectedly, like.
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: It was you. Downtown.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (all innocent)
dialog: Eh?
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: Because that wasn't anything to do with
dialog: me. And suspicion has been cast in my
dialog: direction.
dialog: (pondering)
dialog: Didn't make any sense. Choosing those
dialog: shitheads over me, cutting me out of the
text: deal, then screwing them over too.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: No, I can reassure you on that point.
dialog: Valentine was just as surprised by that
dialog: turn of events as you.
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: He'd already grabbed more than his
dialog: allotted cut. Didn't think he'd be so
dialog: bold as to take all of it.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: All of what?
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: Of the deal, man.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Oh, yeah, right. The deal.
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: But if you're mad at him too and he's mad
dialog: at you ... that must make us pals.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: As you prefer, squire. As you prefer.
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: (weary of his life)
dialog: In which case I'll just do what I usually
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: And that is?
speaker_heading: FEATHER
dialog: What am I doing?
text: He's standing at the window, staring out. As if Wilson isn't
text: even in the room any more. A ship being loaded out there.
text: Inspectors with clipboards. Trucks like the ones we saw at
dialog: that warehouse downtown.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Looking the other way.
dialog: (turns to go)
dialog: Gotcha.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. INN. DAY.
text: Along the way up the coast.
text: Through a window we SEE Valentine and Adhara enjoying a
dialog: pleasant lunch.
text: The bodyguards hang out by the cars outside with fast food
text: bags and drinks.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (to Rick)
dialog: I mean, how much are you getting? Just
dialog: as a point of interest. See, I didn't
dialog: realize there was a sliding scale.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: At a payphone. His idiots in the background. Dials a
dialog: number.
scene_heading: INT. POOL HALL. DAY.
text: Stacy. Nasty bruise on his cheek. Takes a cue off the rack.
text: Chalks up.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Straight rotation, no shit, call your
dialog: shot.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: Lemme break.
text: They're playing against a couple of other creeps.
speaker_heading: CREEP
dialog: You broke last time.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Let him break - he likes to break.
speaker_heading: CREEP
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I wouldn't talk.
speaker_heading: CREEP
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I saw your mother on the Strip last
dialog: night. She went up to three guys, said
dialog: she'd like 'em to stick one in each,
dialog: know what I mean?
text: Creep rushes Stacy. But doesn't get past Uncle John. Who
text: drops him with one punch. Flooring him between two pool
text: tables. Stacy then goes over. Supports himself with a hand
text: on each table, swings his boot into the thug's face.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Stacy.
text: Stacy looks. Bartender holds up phone. Stacy goes over.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER (cont'd)
dialog: I can do without you inhibiting my
dialog: business.
text: Stacy just scowls, takes the phone.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
text: Breaks.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: Hangs up. Goes back to Uncle John. Picks up his cue again.
speaker_heading: STACY (cont'd)
dialog: We've been fired.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. L.A. DAY
dialog: Someone we've never seen before and will never see again
text: stands in Valentine's driveway. His name is FIELDING.
text: A car comes up. Another guy, GRAMMS, sits in it. He waits.
text: Eventually Fielding walks over.
speaker_heading: GRAMMS
dialog: (re: the burnt garage)
dialog: Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
speaker_heading: FIELDING
dialog: (by rote)
dialog: My client has already given a statement
dialog: regarding yesterday's events.
speaker_heading: GRAMMS
dialog: A statement? I wouldn't mind getting a
dialog: statement. You see, my client -- the
dialog: United States Government -- would love to
dialog: get a statement about a few of the deals
dialog: going down with your client.
speaker_heading: FIELDING
dialog: Deals? My client is involved in any
dialog: number of deals at any given moment.
dialog: You'd have to be more specific.
speaker_heading: GRAMMS
dialog: Your client have a deal in Long Beach?
dialog: How about downtown? There's some folks
dialog: there -- oh, wait, they're all dead. Any
dialog: of this ring a bell?
speaker_heading: FIELDING
dialog: My client is an entrepreneur. I am his
dialog: lawyer, not his business manager.
speaker_heading: GRAMMS
dialog: So you wouldn't have any idea how your
dialog: client continues to make so much fucking
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: FIELDING
dialog: He's always been very forward-thinking.
dialog: He invested wisely.
speaker_heading: GRAMMS
dialog: Where is he now?
speaker_heading: FIELDING
dialog: He had urgent business in the north.
text: Gramms just laughs. Just laughs and laughs. And we leave him
text: laughing. And Fielding not.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT. KITCHEN. DAY.
text: Ed takes off an apron, heads out the door. It's clear that
dialog: he's not the head chef here -- because the HEAD CHEF, an
text: Anglo, turns, wondering where he's going. Over this we hear:
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (over)
dialog: Where's Big Sur?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (over)
text: Up the coast.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (over)
dialog: How far?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (over)
dialog: I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (over)
dialog: Fancy it?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (over)
dialog: I could use a vacation. Of course, I
dialog: keep forgetting, for you this is a
dialog: vacation.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (over)
dialog: Never thought of that.
dialog: (grunt of laughter)
dialog: Busman's holiday.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (over)
dialog: What's in Big Sur?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (over)
dialog: That's where Valentine's scarpered.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (over)
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: (over)
dialog: Bloke told me.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WILSON (cont'd)

dialog: You shouldn't go back to your place. Not
dialog: till ... this is resolved.
text: Another beat.
speaker_heading: ELAINE

dialog: I hear it's a nice drive.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT. BACK ALLEY.

speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. COAST HIGHWAY. DAY.

scene_heading: INT. CAR.

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What d'you say, Elaine?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Not much -- you?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Same.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Last time I saw you, weren't you up for
dialog: some equity-waiver thing?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Probably.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I was gonna be in that Michael Mann
dialog: movie, you know -- with Pacino and
dialog: DeNiro. Got three callbacks.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Didn't get it.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Well, those are the breaks.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Not no more, they ain't. I quit that
dialog: acting shit, man.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You just cooking then?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hell, no. I started writing.
text: Elaine and Wilson exchange glances.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY. DAY.

speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: We coulda used the other two-and-a-half

speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: There's more than a measly few grand in
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: There is?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Something's on.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever-
dialog: his-name-is than he thinks I know about
dialog: him and his operation.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: You bet.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: Like what.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Like he'd never hire me for real. Not
dialog: week-to-week. I don't have the
dialog: credentials. He thinks I'm just a
dialog: sociopath, someone he can turn to when he
dialog: needs "plausible denial."
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: Well, we blew it, didn't we? He ain't
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (savage mimicry)
dialog: "He ain't wrong." Listen, I know this
dialog: asshole who did just go to work for him.
dialog: Full-time. And this dickhead's parents
dialog: just told me he took a road trip up the
dialog: coast. That's the type of individual gets
dialog: hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off
text: to his family while on the job.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I don't know who that English guy is.
dialog: Some kind of --
dialog: (finding the word)
dialog: -- courier or something. Maybe a seller.
dialog: Maybe a buyer. But Mr. Avery wanted him,
dialog: those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha
text: there's a briefcase somewhere.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: What's in it?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Drugs? Cash? Both if we're lucky.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: How we gonna get that lucky?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: While they're all fucking each other

scene_heading: INT. WILSON'S CAR.

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I've been wondering something.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Again?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Do you have any friends, man?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yeah, I suppose. Call 'em that, yeah.
dialog: Down the boozer Saturday night. Meet
dialog: some of the lads.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (a little more pointed)
dialog: Friends and colleagues.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: You can't count on very many people,
dialog: that's the trouble. Number of times a
dialog: decent job's been cocked up ...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Poor baby.
text: Little back-seat sarcasm there. Wilson looks kind of bitter.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Useless gits. I was gonna do the Post
dialog: Office once.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What post office?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: The lot. The whole British bloody Post
dialog: Office. I had a brilliant plan -- all
dialog: worked out -- work of genius, it was.
dialog: Could I get anybody interested? No --
text: they're too busy pinching orange squash
text: from the milkman. Lazy sods. Jumble
dialog: sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the
text: crack of dawn.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
text: Flicks some cigarette pack paper out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY.
text: The car speeds along.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE. BIG SUR. DAY.
text: An impressive clifftop dwelling. Isolated on a winding road.
text: On a beautiful promontory overlooking the sea. Valentine
text: RINGS the DOORBELL (actually CHIME). It's opened by his ex-
text: wife. SUSAN. Very well-maintained. 50-something.
text: Surprised to see him. But not overjoyed.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Hello there.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Exercising my visitation rights.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Since when?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: I miss my kids.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: They're at college. Or doesn't your
dialog: accountant even tell you where the money
dialog: goes anymore.
text: Valentine goes inside.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE.
text: He looks around. She doesn't shut the door.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: You've made it ... brighter.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't want you here, Terry.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Sure you do.
text: He turns to look at her. Smiles. Somehow it doesn't work on
dialog: her. One of the reasons she divorced him. Just one. She
text: sighs. Resigned to his presence. Starts to close the door.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE (cont'd)
dialog: Don't shut the door -- I have people with
dialog: me.
dialog: Now she gets it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What kind of trouble are you in?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: No trouble.
text: Susan SEES Adhara get out of the sporty car parked in the
text: drive and stand against it in a posture of younger chick
dialog: defiance.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Surely you can think of somewhere else to
dialog: take one of your chippies for a quick
dialog: getaway.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Susan.
text: He actually puts his hands on her arms. To hold her firm
text: while he locks onto her eyes. And doesn't smile.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE (cont'd)
dialog: I just need ... somewhere remote. Away
text: from L.A. For a couple of days.
dialog: (now the kicker)
dialog: I pay for this house too.
text: Susan reads him. He's not claiming ownership rights. He's
dialog: telling her this house, because of the connection to him, is
dialog: a target of some kind.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What have you done?
text: The Land Cruiser pulls up outside. Avery emerges, comes
text: over, comes in. Susan notes the bodyguards out there as well.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: (to Valentine)
dialog: We weren't followed.
dialog: (to Susan)
dialog: Susan.
text: Valentine lets Susan go. Knowing she's now speechless at
text: what's turned into, as far as she's concerned, a home
dialog: invasion.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: (moving, looking around)
dialog: Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: -- You know his name is Frank.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Is he here?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You know I don't live with him.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Go to him. Go to his studio, or writers
dialog: workshop or artists colony, Esselin
dialog: retreat, nudist camp --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Are you finished?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: In a couple of days this whole thing --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Who's looking for you?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Go now.
text: Encouraging, if not in fact ushering, her towards a bedroom.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It's been five minutes and I'm packing to
dialog: leave again. I can't believe this.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm
dialog: to blame. It's that simple.
text: That does it. Susan turns on him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It is that simple. I blame you for
dialog: everything. Losing inhibitions and
dialog: chicks without bras didn't have to lead
dialog: to hardcore porno in every American
dialog: household: that was you. The first on
dialog: your block to turn on a camera in a hot
dialog: tub and peddle it to your friends. A
dialog: little recreational pot didn't inevitably
dialog: have to lead to the eventual devastation
dialog: of the inner cities: you made that
dialog: happen, the first time you bought a
dialog: bigger stash than you yourself meant to
dialog: smoke. It happened when you made your
text: first buck hyping some so-called "event"
dialog: that was over before it began or marketed
dialog: some "product" whose only value was its
dialog: instant disposability. You were the
dialog: first person to see there was a lot of
dialog: money to be made selling Navajo rugs --
dialog: you've even stolen from the fucking
dialog: Indians! You looked at Charlie Manson
dialog: when all he had to show for himself was a
text: guitar instead of a knife and saw another
dialog: merry prankster, the freedom of the
dialog: frontier. Your pal here --
dialog: (Avery)
dialog: -- He saw gated communities. Rich people
text: coming to him with their money, terrified
dialog: of what people like you had left of this
dialog: society. Why invest in a marriage and
dialog: children when you had him? He's your
dialog: oracle. But you couldn't even trust in
dialog: friendship, could you? Still he's the
dialog: dog you call for its dinner. Because
dialog: everything that might once have been fun
dialog: or nice or sweet you had to turn mean and
dialog: cold and sour. That was your "genius,"
dialog: Terry. Haven't you read your own press?
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL. EVENING.
text: Wilson and his friends pull in. Get out of the car.
dialog: Stretch.
speaker_heading: ELAINE

dialog: What is it, you just like the reassuring

text: Wilson just heads for the motel office. Elaine and Ed follow

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. DECK. BIG SUR HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Adhara sways in a hammock. Staring at Valentine. Wanting to

speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: (finally, to Avery)
dialog: Do any of these guys cook?
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL PORCH. EVENING.
text: Wilson at the car. Elaine and Ed watching.
dialog: Ed has gathered that something has developed between Wilson
text: and Elaine. The way she's looking at Wilson.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ... Reminds me of Jennifer.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (barely perceptible nod)
dialog: Hard to miss.
text: Ed sighs. Awkward.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I thought maybe you just came for the
dialog: ride.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I'd rather be with him than without him.
dialog: I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
text: Wilson walks back to them. Looking at Ed as if to say, ready
text: to go? At her as if to say ... maybe farewell.
scene_heading: EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Tableau. Evening has descended. Surfaces glisten from a
text: light drizzling rain.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE HOUSE, BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: Adhara, dressing. Behind her, outside, way out of focus, a
text: figure slithers by.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Valentine and Avery sit watching TV (CELEBRITY REPORT!). Tom
text: is behind them in the kitchen, flipping through <i>Marie Claire</i>
dialog: magazine.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Turns to look through the sliding glass doors.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Beyond the deck stands Larry, his back to us, facing the
dialog: ocean.
scene_heading: EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE. BACK YARD. NIGHT.
text: Looking toward the house, Larry in the foreground, facing us.
text: He takes a bite from a cinnamon granola bar, then looks at it
text: unhappily as he chews.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Fuck.
scene_heading: EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE, ANOTHER ANGLE. NIGHT.
text: Looking at the house from the top of the hill. Rick stands
text: in the driveway next to Valentine's car, smoking a cigarette.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Wilson and Ed watching him. Wilson nods his head to the
text: left, and Ed moves in that direction. Wilson moves quietly
text: off to the right.
scene_heading: INT. VALENTINE HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Valentine and Avery, still watching TV.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: (re: the channel)
dialog: Check the news.
text: Avery starts looking around.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Where's the remote?
text: Suddenly, we hear a CAR ALARM. Tom looks up from his
text: magazine. Valentine looks to Avery, who shakes his head:
dialog: It's nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE. DRIVEWAY. NIGHT.
text: Rick turns and looks up the driveway toward the sound. He
text: puts his cigarette out.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE. BACK YARD. NIGHT.
text: Larry has turned toward the sound as well. Through a
text: partially obscured side entrance, he sees Rick walking up the
dialog: driveway.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE. DRIVEWAY. NIGHT.
text: Rick walks away from us, toward the vehicle (the Land Cruiser
text: they drove here) parked up the driveway. We lose sight of
text: him as he crosses to the driver's side. The alarm goes off.
text: We hold for several beats. He doesn't emerge.
scene_heading: INT. BIG SUR HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Valentine and Avery are still looking for the remote. Avery
text: stops, his attention drawn to the fact that he hasn't heard
text: anything from Larry. He crosses to the window.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: The driveway, car at the top partially visible. No sign of
dialog: Rick.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: His brow furrows.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Notices this, looks out toward the backyard.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Same as before, except Larry isn't there.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Moves to the sliding glass door to get a better look at the
text: deck and back yard. Still no Larry.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Where's Larry?
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Leaves the window and moves to Valentine. Tom has joined
text: them. After a beat:
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Turn all the lights out. I'll get Adhara.
text: Tom begins looking for the light switches.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: What's happening?
text: Avery is already heading for the bedroom.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Stay away from the windows.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE. BACK YARD. NIGHT.
text: Tableau. Avery exits the kitchen and takes the surrounding
text: porch to the bedroom. Are we seeing this from someone's POV?
scene_heading: INT. BIG SUR HOUSE. BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: Adhara, finished dressing, looking at herself in the mirror.
text: The lights behind her go off. She turns to see Avery coming
text: toward her to turn off the lights by the mirror.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Uh, you've heard of knocking?
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: I need you to come with me.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Why, what --
text: He takes her by the arm. Firmly, but not roughly.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Please.
text: She sees in his expression that something is up.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: INT. BIG SUR HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Tom and Valentine have finally found the light switches, and
text: the room is dark. Valentine moves slowly to the window,
text: takes a tentative peek.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: The driveway. Hard to see. Is there something moving out by
dialog: the shed?
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: (off)
dialog: I thought I said stay away from the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Entering the kitchen with Adhara in tow. He brings her
text: around behind the counter.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Everybody in the kitchen.
text: Valentine and Tom move to join Avery and Adhara.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Behind the counter.
text: Everyone moves behind the large counter in the center of the
text: kitchen and crouches down. They have a wall behind them and
text: all the windows in front of them.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: (scared)
dialog: What's going on?
text: Avery and Tom have drawn their guns.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: We think someone is here.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: We think?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: We can't find ...
dialog: (what are their names?)
dialog: ... two of our guys.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (fucking typical)
dialog: Larry and Rick.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Did somebody call the cops?
text: Tom snorts. Avery looks at Valentine: Haven't you told this
dialog: girl anything?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Because --
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Because I'm taking care of it.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: You guys are fucking nuts, I'm calling --
text: She starts to stand. Valentine pulls her down.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Mr. Avery.
text: Avery looks to Tom, who nods toward the back porch.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: A silhouetted figure is tentatively making its way along the
text: porch, trying not to be seen. We don't get a very clear
dialog: glimpse.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Draws his gun and takes aim.
speaker_heading: THE FIGURE
text: Careful not to become fully visible, but growing more
text: courageous with each step.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Locked on him, waiting.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Puts Adhara's hand to her ears.
speaker_heading: THE FIGURE
dialog: We see a little more now than we have before.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: He sees enough. Squeezes off a series of SHOTS, the muzzle
text: flash strobing the kitchen area like a flashbulb, Adhara and
text: Valentine flinching.
speaker_heading: THE FIGURE
text: Hit. Spinning and collapsing to the ground.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Lowers his gun. Turns to Tom.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Watch my back.
text: Avery moves out from behind the counter and heads for the
dialog: body.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE. BACK PORCH. NIGHT.
text: Avery makes his way to the figure, which is on its stomach
text: and writhing slightly.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Careful. Takes the gun and turns the body over.
speaker_heading: STACY
text: Stares up at him, choking on his last few breaths.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Puzzled. What the hell is this guy doing here? He starts
text: feeling around Stacy's jacket for anything useful, but is
text: interrupted when his hand EXPLODES, accompanied by the sound
text: of a gunshot. He screams in pain.
scene_heading: INT. BIG SUR HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
text: Valentine and Adhara drop to the floor. Tom, gun raised and
text: pointing, tries to see who shot Avery.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE. BACK PORCH. NIGHT.
text: Avery is turning toward his assailant, but not fast enough.
text: A shot rings out and part of his neck disappears in a blossom
text: of blood. Stunned, he falls on his side, gasping.
speaker_heading: AVERY'S POV
text: Uncle John. Close by, huddled by the lip of the cliff. He
text: starts to move cautiously toward Avery and Stacy.
scene_heading: INT. BIG SUR HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
text: Tom squints, trying to see.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Fuck.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Avery's down.
speaker_heading: TOM'S POV
text: A piece of Uncle John's silhouette appears.
speaker_heading: TOM
text: Fires at it. Didn't hit anything.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Fuck this.
text: Tom jumps up and runs for the living room, firing his gun in
text: front of him toward where he last saw Uncle John's
dialog: silhouette.
speaker_heading: LIVING AREA
text: Tom runs through and reaches the sliding doors to the back
text: porch. A portion of the frame SPLINTERS from a gun shot as
text: he gains access to the other side of the back porch.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE. BACK PORCH. NIGHT.
text: Tom is through the sliding doors and trying to make his way
text: around to the driveway.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
text: Crouched behind the opposite end of the porch, sticks his
dialog: head up.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Tom crossing to the steps, slips on the damp wood, tries to
dialog: right himself.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
text: Squeezes off two shots.
speaker_heading: TOM
text: Is shot in the ankle as he is about to reach the steps. He
text: yelps in pain, tries to raise his gun.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
text: Crouched down. A shot flies over his head.
speaker_heading: TOM
text: Stops shooting. Tries dragging his shattered ankle to the
dialog: steps.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
text: Looks over the edge of the porch.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Tom turning toward the steps.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
text: Fires at him.
speaker_heading: TOM
text: Screams again as his elbow of his gun hand disintegrates. He
text: slips on the first step and tumbles down, the gun bouncing
text: beside him.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
text: Sees this. Stands up to cross the back porch. Takes a step
text: forward but is stopped by a bullet in the chest (about the
text: only clean shot anybody makes). He looks down at himself.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
dialog: Shit.
text: He looks up to SEE:
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Near death. Gun in his good hand. He squeezes the trigger
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: UNCLE JOHN
text: A small black hole appears in his cheek. He blinks, begins
text: to raise his hand to his face, and collapses.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Exhales and rolls over.
speaker_heading: TOM
text: Still trying to get to his feet. He gives up and just lies
text: there, panting.
speaker_heading: A HAND
text: Reaches for the gun beside Tom. Tilt up with it to reveal:
speaker_heading: ED
text: He puts the gun in his jacket and slides away.
scene_heading: INT. BIG SUR HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
text: Valentine and Adhara are still stuck behind the counter.
text: Valentine sees the shadowy shape of Ed slipping behind the
text: back porch.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Decides to make a run for it, following Tom's route, away
dialog: from Ed.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Valentine runs to the sliding door, smack into:
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Standing there. Wet. Mad. He grabs Valentine by the shirt
text: and pushes him back into the room.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Bounces off the couch and onto the floor.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Comes toward him.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Grabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at Wilson. It
text: careens off Wilson's arm and shatters.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Is almost on him now.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Tries to scramble away. Throwing anything he can get his
text: hands on at.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Who keeps coming. He grabs Valentine, pulls him up, then
text: throws him into the television.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Crashes into the TV face first and bounces to the floor.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Goes to him, grabs him by the neck with one hand and pulls
text: out his gun with the other. He seems about to speak when
text: suddenly he screams instead.
speaker_heading: WILSON
speaker_heading: AAAAGGGGHHHH!
speaker_heading: ADHARA
text: Has just stuck a kitchen knife into Wilson's back.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Turns instinctively and whips the pistol around, smashing
text: Adhara in the mouth.
speaker_heading: ADHARA
text: Hits the ground. She won't be retaliating.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: In agony, spinning, trying to reach the knife in his back,
text: but IT'S JUST BEYOND HIS REACH.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Scrambles through the sliding glass door.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE. BACK PORCH. NIGHT.
text: Valentine stumbles out. Notices Avery slumped on the deck,
text: mortally wounded. Goes to him -- as if concerned -- but
text: actually just to take the gun. Then runs off the porch
text: toward the STEPS that lead down to the sea.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Comes out after him, the knife still in his back. So intent
text: on catching Valentine he fails at first to notice Avery lying
text: in the shadows.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Has just barely managed to reach Stacy's pistol. Raises it
text: weakly. Points it at Wilson.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Seems to feel it. Turns. Locks eyes with Avery. Avery
text: could already have shot him. But there's a momentary sense of
dialog: recognition: both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats --
dialog: and Avery's is not worth saving.
speaker_heading: AVERY
text: Lowers the gun. Nods in the direction Valentine went.
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: ... that way ...
text: Wilson moves on. Avery just lies there, presumably to die.
scene_heading: EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE. STEPS. NIGHT.
text: Valentine hurries down the rickety steps. Trying not to slip
text: in the darkness, though there are tiny Malibu lights
text: illuminating the steep and winding wooden framework.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. NIGHT.
text: A rocky cove. Valentine looks back up the way he came,
text: HEARING the FOOTSTEPS coming down after him. Backs away a
text: few paces on the slippery rocks. Falls.
text: Lands on the crumpled, dead body of LARRY, the bodyguard, who
text: was thrown off the cliff. Valentine recoils. When Wilson
text: appears, Valentine FIRES at him. A wild shot that only makes
text: Wilson duck momentarily. Valentine scrambles to his feet,
text: runs on.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Jumps down from the steps. Stops for a moment and leans his
text: back against the railing. Bends at the knees slightly.
speaker_heading: THE KNIFE
text: The handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Grimacing, pulls the knife out and discards it.
text: FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH
text: Valentine runs. Or tries to. It's dark and the ground is
text: treacherous. The beach runs out pretty soon. Now just
dialog: rocks. Maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the
text: point at the other end. But he can't see very far ahead.
dialog: And the tide is in, water making any escape extremely
text: difficult. He tries to scramble over some rocks. They're
text: wet, slippery. He falls, cries out as he literally breaks an
dialog: ankle.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: A dark figure. Coming into focus. Walking inexorably this
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Painfully rights himself. A small bone protrudes from his
text: broken ankle. He FIRES at Wilson, gun in one hand, other
text: hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it. Doing his best
text: to aim. But the SHOTS miss their mark.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Steadily coming.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
text: Out of bullets now. Gun CLICKING crazily on empty. He
text: simply drops it.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Now stands before him.
speaker_heading: THE TWO OF THEM
text: Both breathing hard.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Tell me.
dialog: This is not what Valentine expected.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Tell you ...
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: About Jenny.
dialog: (closer)
dialog: Tell me about Jenny.
dialog: (closer)
dialog: About the deal. Whatever fucking deal
dialog: you had to kill my daughter for when she
dialog: found out about it, you bastard.
text: Wilson drops to the ground too, in a passionate fury, starts
text: strangling Valentine.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Tell me. Tell me about it, you fucking
dialog: bastard.
text: Easing up just enough for Valentine to sputter out a
dialog: response.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: She could've had the deal! I would've
dialog: handed it to her if she wanted. I would
dialog: have given her everything.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Why then. Why did you do it!
text: They're locked in a kind of embrace. Sprayed by the waves
text: crashing into the rocks. Sweating and gasping and exhausted
text: and hurt and furious.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: She didn't want to share it, she wanted
dialog: to stop it. To stop me. She said she'd
dialog: turn me in.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Shock of recognition on his face. At those words.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: She said, "You go ahead with this, I'll
dialog: turn you in, Terry."
text: Wilson sits back. Panting. Totally spent. The two of them.
text: Both on the ground now. Whatever energy they had left drained
text: -- Valentine from his confession, Wilson from hearing it.
text: Valentine shaking, sobbing. Still not realizing the pathetic
dialog: folly of his actions.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: She was serious. She would have done it.
text: She had the phone in her hand. She was
dialog: going to do it.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Knows that the girl he loved ... loved Valentine, too. Having
text: heard the truth, the last vestige of revenge has vanished.
text: He gets up and walks away. Leaving the quivering shell of
text: Valentine behind.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. BIG SUR HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Adhara wakes up. Hand to her smashed cheek and mouth. But
text: it's not her hand. It's Valentine's. She sort of shuffles
text: away from him along the floor. Sits against a wall holding
text: her face. Valentine sits back against an opposite wall.
text: They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: CUT.
scene_heading: INT. PLANE. DAY.
text: Wilson, lost in thought. Accepts a drink from a FLIGHT
text: ATTENDANT. We can see it pains him to reach for it.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Ta.
text: After setting the glass down, his other hand goes to the
text: shoulder where his stab wound was no doubt only temporarily
dialog: dealt with.
scene_heading: <i>FLASH CUTS:
text: WILSON. At the roadside hotel, grimacing.
text: ELAINE. Cleaning his wound.</i>
text: Wilson rubs his shoulder. The AMERICAN LADY in the seat
dialog: beside him heard the way he said thanks to the Flight
dialog: Attendant.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: You're English.
text: A small beat (which he takes each time he responds).
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yeah, that's right.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: I can never decide what I like better.
dialog: Leaving home, or coming back.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Takes this in.
scene_heading: <i>FLASH CUTS:
text: WILSON. Shaving in the mirror at his L.A. motel. He stops.
text: WILSON. In the car leaving Valentine's house. Fingering the
dialog: picture of Jenny.</i>
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I would have preferred staying home, me.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: You're a reluctant traveller, then.
text: Wilson nods.
scene_heading: <i>FLASH CUTS:
text: WILSON. In the car with Elaine and Ed, driving back from Big
dialog: Sur. Everyone in their own world.
text: WILSON. At Ed's house. Saying goodbye.
text: WILSON AND ED. Shake hands.
text: ED. Watching him get into Elaine's car.</i>
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Got called out to L.A., unexpected like,
dialog: to do a job of work.
scene_heading: <i>FLASH CUTS:
text: WILSON. At the airport, staring at Elaine.
text: ELAINE. Staring back.
text: WILSON AND ELAINE. She embraces him.
text: ELAINE. She watches him leave.
text: WILSON. Disappearing into the terminal.</i>
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: You'll be looking forward to getting
dialog: back, then.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yeah. Another little matter needs
dialog: attending to soon as I return.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: No rest for the wicked.
text: Wilson nods, exhales.
speaker_heading: <i>FLASH CUT:
text: WILSON. In the cab on the way to Ed's, at the beginning of
text: the film. Watching the lights go by.</i>
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Been away a lot.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Where else?
text: Longer beat. He actually turns to look at her now. Takes
text: her in, then looks forward again.
speaker_heading: WILSON
text: Out on a oil rig. In the North Sea.
dialog: Nine years.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: Nine years?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Is that legal?
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Well, time off for good behavior, you
dialog: know. I shouldn't have even been there
dialog: -- it was these other blokes who shoulda
dialog: gone in my place. I got lumbered with
dialog: the job they were responsible for. I
dialog: don't mind pulling me own cart, but not
dialog: someone else's, know what I mean.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: But you stuck it out, anyway, all that
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: I had to, didn't I. Nothing else for it.
dialog: Then just when I'd finished my nine years
dialog: -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger
dialog: off to the States.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: (reacting slightly to his
dialog: "colorful" language)
dialog: Sounds like you need a rest.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Could do, yeah.
text: Another beat.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: But first I gotta give these lads a
dialog: talking to, these geezers what sent me up
text: the river, in a manner of speaking.
speaker_heading: LADY
dialog: The ones whose burden you took upon your
dialog: own shoulders.
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Yeah.
text: And he turns away, to the window. Looks at the blue sky.
text: Sips his drink. Then, hard:
speaker_heading: WILSON
dialog: Them next.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: THE END.
dialog:
