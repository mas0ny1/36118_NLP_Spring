scene_heading: INT. JOE'S ROOM - DAY
text: Joe enters and takes out his pad and pencil. He sits on the
text: bed. On the pillow, he sees and picks up a black and red
text: hunting jacket, onto which the one foot short sleeve has been
text: knitted in baby blue. There is a card in the picket that
text: reads "Better than new -- it's got a story!" He puts it
dialog: down.
text: He picks up his notebook, in which he has written: "The
dialog: Purpose of the Second Chance is to allow you to make the same
dialog: mistake twice."
text: He stops by the mirror on the chiffonier into which he puts
text: the lure, which still has the attached card reading "The
dialog: truth may not always set you free, but it's always the truth
dialog: - Joseph Turner White."
text: Joe goes to the bed. On the bed is a small package tied with
text: ribbon. Joe opens it.
scene_heading: ANGLE INS.
text: It is a small thing of maple syrup. Attached to it is a card
dialog: reading: "It is your invention which makes everything sweet."

scene_heading: ANGLE INS.
text: The back of the card reads: "How about an Associate Producer
dialog: credit...?"
text: He takes the paper, balls it up and throws them into the
text: trash. He picks up the fishing lure which is resting on the
text: typewriter. Puts it into his pocket, thinks again, throws it
text: in the trash. Shakes his head, and picks up his suitcase and
text: starts packing...

dialog: true?
speaker_heading: DOC WILSON
dialog: It's the truth that you should never
