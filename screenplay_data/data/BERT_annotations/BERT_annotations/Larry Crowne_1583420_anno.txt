text: Hurley takes over, as blank as a tax-form.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HURLEY

dialog: horizons.
text: Larry Crowne has no idea what that means.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

text: Larry ponders this moment for as long as he can. He

dialog: Bang.
dialog: 
text: It's a pretty good whammy kiss. Makes her splay her arms and
dialog: everything.
text: Larry pulls back. After a bit, though. She could have kept
text: at it, too.
speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE
dialog: Wow...
speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT
dialog: Pretty dang good. I still got it,

speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE

speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT

dialog: P.O.V.

scene_heading: EXT. E.C.C.C. TEACHERS' PARKING LOT - MORNING
text: Mercy feels terrible, stepping from her car, brutally

text: As she straightens up, her eye catches...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE
dialog: 
text: On his scooter. Heading towards the Scooter parking.
dialog: 
text: She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the
text: memory of last night warrants it. She heads in that

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: direction.
scene_heading: EXT. E.C.C.C. CAMPUS - SAME
text: Mercy is trying to 'accidentally' run into Larry, but is
dialog: caught by surprise when..
text: He is walking right towards her. Oops. That would be
text: uncomfortable. She DUCKS behind a pillar.
text: Still wanting to 'bump' into the man who kissed her last
text: night, she circumvents his path, stalking Larry like a
text: birdwatcher tracks a blue-tailed swallow.
text: Hopping behind a tree, Mercy's SHOE gets caught in some mud.
text: Bending down, a branch catches her sweater and RIPS a seam.
text: Stepping onto the pavement, the tree branch SMACKS her in the
dialog: head.
text: Still, she keeps and eye on Larry. And pursues...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENCH AREA
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Staying out of his eye line, Mercy navigates her way around
text: to the other side of the Bench Area and preps her appearance

dialog: with Larry.
text: Then she sees her.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: 
text: Sitting with others, greeting Larry with laughter and hugs

speaker_heading: MERCY
dialog: Is crushed. For the obvious reasons sh s ill can't

speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE
dialog: Epilog. School today.
speaker_heading: TALIA
dialog: Lance! A Betty on your Scooter
dialog: after midnight? Holding on, her
dialog: arms around you, pressed against
dialog: your back, is a license to at least
dialog: cop a feel.
speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE
dialog: If we had ended up making out, you
dialog: still wouldn't hear it.
text: Talia slugs him. All in play...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCY

scene_heading: INT. SPEECH 217 - DAY
text: Mercedes is in the back, wearing the darkest glasses allowed
text: a teacher in a classroom, hiding the fact that Mercy is
text: looking at Larry.
text: Larry is listening to Lala with delight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PINEDO
dialog: Seeing them -- the Northern Lights,
dialog: the Aurora Borealis -- should have
dialog: been beyond me, but I was a little

text: somewhere over Greenland with a
text: shimmering curtain of emerald,
dialog: gossamer light dancing just for me.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: That is something I will remember
dialog: forever.
text: The SPEECH is over. The class erupts in applause for Lala,
text: who has hit a home-run. Foremost of the fans, Larry, who
text: rises in applause for the once quiet classmate.
text: Then the applause is over.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The teacher says nothing. DIBIASI
dialog: 
dialog: That was a knockout speech, Lala.
dialog: Made the news. Caused riots

text: The students look at each other, shrug their shoulders, and
dialog: head ou .
speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT
dialog: Mr. Crowne? A moment please?
speaker_heading: CALIMERIS
dialog: Why doesn't she just throw herself

speaker_heading: PINEDO
dialog: This is bordering on harassment

speaker_heading: DIBIASI

speaker_heading: MACK
dialog: Why doesn't this ever happen to me?
dialog: 89.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT
dialog: I need a few moments alone with Mr.

speaker_heading: DIBIASI

speaker_heading: MACK
dialog: You want I should close this door,

speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE

speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT
dialog: Last night was a confluence of too
dialog: many things happening in too short
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: a time span.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE
dialog: Last i ht? Let's see, what was I
dialog: doing? Studying some. Working
dialog: some. Can't recall. I've forgotten
dialog: everything that happened last night
dialog: as best a gentleman can.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT
dialog: I had no right to judge you or your
dialog: relationships. Date who you want.
text: Larry has no idea what that means.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
dialog: But what happened last night --
dialog: between adults -- was
dialog: inappropriate. If gossip were to
dialog: circulate, the problem could be
dialog: more than just embarrassing. My
dialog: status as a professor could be
text: tarnished.
speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE
dialog: I wouldn't want that.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT
dialog: happened before.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
text: With parking attendants. Strangers

dialog: first time with a student.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I hope the entire thing will be
dialog: forgotten.
text: Larry has just had his feelings hurt by his teacher.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE
dialog: Sure. Nothing happened. At all.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT
dialog: So there will be no bravado among

speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE
dialog: None.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Crowne.
speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: winning the lottery.
speaker_heading: LAMARR
dialog: I read how the universe is
dialog: expanding, Larry, taking us along

speaker_heading: LARRY CROWNE

dialog: Are we making a mistake here?
speaker_heading: DEAN TAINOT

speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT
dialog: Point made. We could change
dialog: things. We could start right now.
speaker_heading: DEAN TAINOT
dialog: We could. Why should we?
speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT
dialog: Because we have history, Dean. But
dialog: first, my thoughts... I've got to
dialog: address drinking. I should be
dialog: able to comprehend and respond to
dialog: both sides of our conversations. And
dialog: the morning shower should be
dialog: refreshing, not a hangover cure.
speaker_heading: DEAN TAINOT
dialog: I'd like that too.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DEAN TAINOT
dialog: You're not a pleasant woman after a

speaker_heading: MERCEDES TAINOT

speaker_heading: (THEN)
