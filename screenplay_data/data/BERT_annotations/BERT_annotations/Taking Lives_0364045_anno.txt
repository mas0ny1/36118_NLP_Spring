scene_heading: INT. BUS STATION - DAY
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: 17 YEARS AGO
text: Small, Canadian, rural. Just the Native American CASHIER
text: jotting down sports stats from the paper. MARTIN, 16,
text: enters. Slight, pale and frail, new clothes, a tag still
text: hangs from his stiff work jacket. Martin stands in front
text: of the Cashier a beat. Nervously tugs an earlobe.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Sir. Sir, may I have a ticket to
dialog: Montreal please?
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I need a ticket to Montreal.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Montreal?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes, sir. Please.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Forty-three dollars.
text: Martin pulls out an envelope filled with crisp twenties
text: and carefully counts out three. The Cashier gives Martin
text: his ticket and change. Points at a bus outside. The
text: DRIVER loading bags.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - DAY
text: A half dozen PASSENGERS. Martin steps aboard, takes a
text: seat. DAN SOULSBY, Martin's age, sits next to him,
text: offers a hand. Martin shakes.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Dan Soulsby.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Martin. Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Where you heading to?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Away from here.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Dan produces a couple beers from his pockets. Offers
dialog: Martin one.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Pisswater.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: At least it's cold pisswater.
dialog: Here's to getting away.
text: They CLINK CANS. The Driver enters the bus. Unlocks the
text: airbrakes. Puts the bus in reverse, gives it gas.
text: BOOM! The ENGINE throws a rod. Horrible GRINDING.
text: Smoke wafts into the windows. The Driver KILLS the
text: ENGINE. Silence. Martin and Dan trade looks.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That was bad.
dialog: (bummed)
dialog: It's gonna take all day to get
dialog: another bus here.
text: Martin sighs, looks out the window.
scene_heading: WHAT MARTIN SEES
text: A car rental place.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Martin fingers the envelope of cash in his pocket.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: You have a license?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Had one. They took it away.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I got one. Let's go.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Dan drives. JOURNEY ON the RADIO. Martin checks out
text: Dan's guitar. Dan shows Martin his teeth.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: See that? They're all fake.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: You take a hockey puck in the
dialog: face?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: A fist. My stepdad socked me. I
text: flew across the room and dented
dialog: the sheetrock in the kitchen. My
dialog: mom saw everything and still took
dialog: his side.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: You got cracked good.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I hate that guy. Two hundred
text: pounds of worthless grease.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Why'd he hit you?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I wrecked his sixty-five Mustang
dialog: and his boat in the same week.
dialog: His babies. I totaled them.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I would have popped you too.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: It was worth it. But I didn't
dialog: deserve the tour in hell.
text: Dan rubs his close-cropped hair.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Don't ever go to military school
dialog: if you can help it. It sucks.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I jumped the wall two days ago.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: You going back?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I'm done with that racket. I'm
dialog: going to Seattle and playing
dialog: music.
dialog: Martin tries the guitar, he's not that good.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I know some chords.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Think you can learn drums?
dialog: 4.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - DAY
text: The land rolls endlessly. Martin drives. Dan plays his
dialog: guitar. He's really good.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I'm the next Billy Squire. Krokus
dialog: will be opening for me one day.
text: POW! The CAR HITS a BOTTLE. A front tire deflates.
text: Martin guides the crippled vehicle to the curb.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The middle of nowhere. Martin flips a coin. Heads.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Shit.
text: Dan hauls the spare from the trunk. Sets the jack under
text: the bumper.
text: A PICKUP TRUCK approaches. Still a mile away.
text: Martin watches Dan lean in the trunk for the tire iron.
text: The pickup gets closer, a big one. Heavy with bags of
text: animal feed. Speeding.
text: Martin looking at Dan's back. Martin shoves Dan hard,
text: into the highway. In front of:
text: THE GRILL OF THE PICKUP
text: WHAM! It plasters Dan. He goes over the hood, SHATTERS
text: the front WINDSHIELD. Bounces off, spins like a rag doll
text: into a ditch.
text: The pickup has lost control, it rolls. Several times, a
text: heaving mass of steel.
text: CRASH! The TRUCK folds itself around a husky tree. No
dialog: survivors, that's clear.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
text: He can't believe what he has just done. He takes in the
text: carnage, tugs at his ear.
scene_heading: EXT. MONTREAL - DAY
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: PRESENT DAY
text: ESTABLISHING the river-bound city. Beautiful.
dialog: 5.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. LAWRENCE RIVER - DAY
text: A large Ferry plies the unstoppable waters. Gliding
text: toward skyscrapers.
scene_heading: EXT. FERRY PIER - DAY
text: The signs in French. Crowded with PASSENGERS waiting to
text: board. As more PASSENGERS pour off the just-docked ship.
text: A WOMAN runs through the crowd. Terror etched in her
text: face. She knocks aside several PEOPLE. Runs toward a
text: row of restaurants. Even in her turmoil, she is
text: patrician, elegant.
scene_heading: EXT. PIER-SIDE CAFE - DAY
text: Two BEAT COPS eat at an outdoor table. Laid back. The
text: WOMAN approaches them, frantic.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I just saw my dead son get off the
dialog: ferry.
text: The COPS trade looks.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Listen to me; he's been dead
dialog: eighteen years. He just walked
dialog: right past me.
scene_heading: INT. MONTREAL PD OFFICE - DAY
text: An INSPECTOR pours the Woman tea. She has calmed down.
text: He takes his pen, looking at her statement.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You need to open that grave. It
dialog: can't be my son in there.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: I lost my mother two years ago.
dialog: Every day I think I see her.
text: Driving to work in the car next to
text: me. At mass. Shopping, I see
dialog: her, but this is someone else's
dialog: mother. You see?
text: The Woman lays a hand on his arm, looks him in the eye.
dialog: There is something formidable about her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Inspector, I'm saddened by your
text: loss and touched by loyalty. But
dialog: let's focus on the matter at hand.
text: He walked right past me. We made
dialog: eye contact. I know he recognized
dialog: me. It was my son. A mother
dialog: knows these things. I will sign
dialog: anything, I will swear before a
dialog: judge. And thank you, I do have
dialog: all my faculties and friends who
dialog: can vouch for my character.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Did you talk to this man, he is a
dialog: man now?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Yes. Of course he's a man. He'd
dialog: be thirty-two. And no, I did not
dialog: speak with him. I ran.
dialog: (low, serious)
dialog: Inspector, my son was very, very
dialog: disturbed. He had serious
dialog: emotional problems. I assure you
dialog: he was.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Is. Is a dangerous person.
text: He hands her some forms.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Madame. The police department
dialog: cannot resolve your problem. You
dialog: need to get permits from the
dialog: coroner and health and safety
dialog: department. You pay for an
dialog: exhumation. You have someone
dialog: qualified examine the remains. If
dialog: it is the wrong body, the Forensic
dialog: Examiner will confirm there is a
dialog: problem and call us. Then we open
text: an investigation.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: No, Quebec City police will
text: investigate. He is buried there,
dialog: no?
text: The Woman bristles. Stands, takes the forms.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: No. Inspector. He is not.
dialog: 7.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
text: Deep woods. In the mountains. Near a roaring river. A
text: log vacation cabin is being erected by CONSTRUCTION
speaker_heading: WORKERS.
text: A BACK HOE digs a trench. The scoop snags something -- a
text: wetsuit -- worn by a long dead corpse, twirling slowly,
text: hanging from the bucket's steel teeth. The BACK HOE
text: OPERATOR jumps off the huge machine, stares at the
text: headless body he has just dragged from its grave.
text: Workers gather and gawk.
speaker_heading: WORKER
text: Someone call the cops.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT
scene_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL and INSPECTOR REYNAUD, rock solid French
dialog: Canadians, pin photographs of the body we just saw on the
text: wall. Laval steps back. Takes in the display.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: (subtitled French)
dialog: Think she will like this?
text: Reynaud shrugs. Laval tosses him a Newsweek.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: (subtitled French)
dialog: We are lucky the FBI is sending
dialog: her. She is the Michael Jordan of
dialog: criminal profiling.
dialog: (off Reynaud's look)
text: The Guy Le Fleuer of profiling.
dialog: She will save our ass.
text: The PHONE RINGS. Laval answers.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: (subtitled French)
dialog: Inspector Laval.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Have the airline check again.
dialog: Look around baggage claim.
dialog: (to Reynaud)
dialog: She was on the flight but they
dialog: can't find her.
text: Reynaud's CELL RINGS.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: INSPECTOR REYNAUD
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Oui?

scene_heading: INSPECTOR REYNAUD
dialog: (subtitled French)
dialog: I know where she is.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DARKNESS
text: We hear BREATHING and the SOFT RUSH of a RIVER. Soft,
text: rhythmic. Then FOOTSTEPS.
text: Two eyes open, reflect moonlight. The FOOTSTEPS drawing
dialog: closer.
text: CLICK! A FLASHLIGHT turns on. REVEALING:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
text: GRACE VANDERHOLT lies in the grave where the body was
text: discovered. It has been excavated by criminologists, the
text: soil sifted, the grass and brush removed. Grace sits up.
text: Grace holds out her FBI creds, shielding her eyes from
text: the bright light.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's okay, I'm supposed to be
dialog: here.
text: CLICK. The LIGHT goes off. REVEALING Laval and Reynaud.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Agent Vanderholt, we requested
dialog: your help. I'm Inspector Laval,
dialog: this is Inspector Reynaud.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Hi. Look, I'm not ready to talk
dialog: to you guys yet. I need a little
dialog: more time here.
text: Reynaud and Laval trade looks, walk toward two UNIFORMS
text: guarding the site.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Grace lays back down. Sighs. Concentrates on the
text: sounds. The RIVER. WIND in the trees. Then: LAUGHTER
speaker_heading: (O.S.).
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Would you mind trading one liners
dialog: somewhere else? I need to hear
dialog: the natural sounds. I appreciate
dialog: it.
text: The policemen have gathered in a chummy knot. Laval
text: gestures for them to walk down the road.
speaker_heading: ON GRACE
text: She steps out of the grave. Sits by it. Writes some
text: notes. Everything glistens in the moonlight, alive.
text: Grace takes it in for a beat.
text: Then: HOWLING, the lonely song of a distant WOLF.
text: Grace rises, crosses to the river, to a big gravel bar.
text: Used as a campsite complete with a large fire pit. Grace
text: sits by the fire pit.
text: More HOWLING, CLOSER this time.
text: Grace looks down river, SEES the glowing eyes of a TIMBER
text: WOLF staring from a clump of trees. The animal stares a
text: beat, then runs off. Grace has the chills.
text: Grace walks quietly toward the trees. Grace just a few
text: feet away. RUSTLING. She cautiously moves aside a
text: sapling.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK - GRACE'S FLASHLIGHT - NIGHT
text: A TIMBER WOLF nestled amidst the trees gnaws on
text: something; a HUMAN HEAD.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT
text: Grace stands there alone, the wolf is long gone. She
text: stoops, pushes aside brush. She finds a hollow under
text: some roots. Grace CLICKS on her FLASHLIGHT.
speaker_heading: WHAT SHE SEES
text: A human skull stares up from the hollow. Picked clean,
text: weathered.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD IN THE FOREST - NIGHT
text: Laval and Reynaud, and the two UNIFORMS smoke and joke.
text: A quiet beat as the WIND picks up. Their cars up the
dialog: road in the b.g.
text: SOMETHING MOVES in the woods. Inspector Reynaud draws
text: his Glock. SHUSHES the men.
text: A beat. MOVEMENT. Laval signals for the men to spread
text: out. Holsters are UNSNAPPED. Reynaud is all eyes and
text: ears as he picks his way toward the trees.
text: GRACE emerges from the trees, a laser-aiming dot on her
text: forehead. She REACTS to Reynaud, raises her hands.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Don't shoot, I'm on your team.
text: Reynaud holsters his gun. The men relax. Grace takes
dialog: Inspector Laval aside.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Call who you have to call. I
text: found his head.
text: Laval REACTS.
scene_heading: INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY
text: Gloved hands carefully remove the skull from a box. The
text: MEDICAL EXAMINER places the skull on an exam table and
text: begins cleaning it.
text: Grace walks around the headless body. The wetsuit has
text: been removed, the body has been autopsied. Headless,
text: skeletal hands, the legs are surprisingly well-preserved.
text: DIRECTOR GILLET is tall, heavy, smoking a cigar. He's a
dialog: cop's cop and all-around nice guy.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: I can't tell you how excited we
dialog: are to have you here.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You only have one victim. Usually
dialog: there's two or three by the time I
dialog: get called in.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: This case made page one of the
dialog: Globe. The tabloids say there is
text: a headhunter on the loose.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET (CONT'D)
dialog: The Mayor wants closure. That's
dialog: his vacation house they were
dialog: building. I get calls from
dialog: supervisors I didn't know I had.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You clear the Mayor?
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: We cleared the Mayor. He read the
dialog: article on you in Newsweek and
dialog: insisted we fly you up. The
dialog: papers say two campers had a
text: drunken fight and the loser lost
text: his head.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: What do you think?
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: I don't solve crimes anymore, I
dialog: balance budgets.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: This was not a heat of the moment
dialog: killing. And the victim was
text: buried complete with head. The
dialog: grave was five-foot ten. The
text: victim's height. With square
text: corners. Dug with a shovel the
dialog: killer had the foresight to bring.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
text: Thirty-five detectives searched
dialog: the area Saturday. My
dialog: investigators think you're a
dialog: witch.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I've been called worse.
text: The Medical Examiner finds two small holes in the skull,
text: waves the PHOTOGRAPHER over.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: Jeez. Look at that, looks like he
dialog: got ice-picked.
text: She simulates fangs with her hands, they match marks on
text: the skull.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No. A large canine did that.
dialog: Probably an old or sick timber
dialog: wolf that couldn't hunt. It dug
text: up the body and chewed off the
text: head. It felt safe in the trees,
text: away from the riverbank, away from
text: the other wolves.
text: The Medical examiner looks at a chewed vertebrate.
speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
dialog: I'd say you're right.
dialog: (into tape recorder)
text: Postmortem scavenger damage to C-1.
text: The Medical Examiner examines the skull's teeth.
speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
text: The victim was afraid of dentists.
dialog: Bad teeth.
text: Inspectors Laval and Reynaud enter. Both give Grace wary
text: nods. Inspector Laval hands the Medical Examiner a paper
text: bag marked HUMAN REMAINS.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
text: This was a meter from the skull.
text: At soil level.
text: The Medical Examiner opens the bag. Removes a wig. No,
text: not a wig; someone's ponytail and leathered scalp.
text: Tangled with the hair is a braid of green nylon cord tied
text: to two pieces of broomstick. The Photographer SNAPS some
dialog: shots.
text: The Medical Examiner gingerly untangles the cord.
speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
dialog: Look at this.
text: Grace crosses, grins. Grace studies the cord, noting the
text: intricate knots.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Bingo. That's your murder weapon.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
text: It might be trash a camper left.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: No. Look at it, braided parachute
text: cord, two pieces of broom stick.
dialog: You approach the victim from
text: behind, loop it around his head
dialog: and hold on for all your might.
dialog: The more the victim struggles, the
text: quicker he passes out. And now
dialog: you have convenient handles to
dialog: drag around two hundred pounds of
text: dead kayaker.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: That is a theory.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: That's exactly what it is. A
dialog: theory. That evidence supports.
dialog: When the suspect is in custody you
dialog: can ask him yourself what happened
dialog: and you won't need me. Inspector.
text: Laval bristles, he crosses to check his cell messages.
text: Gillet looks at Grace, at the cord. Turns to her
text: quietly.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: Laval and Reynaud are my stars.
dialog: Very smart, very persistent
text: investigators. On the street;
dialog: they're magnificent.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I can see that Director. You're
dialog: lucky to have them.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Go ahead, Director, say what you
dialog: have to say.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: You're the expert. If you have
dialog: any suggestions on how to
dialog: proceed...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Sure. A forensic anthropologist
dialog: can draw the victim's face based
dialog: on the skull. I know someone at
dialog: Quantico who can do it by
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: We have people.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Call 'em. Then show the results
dialog: to everybody around who was
dialog: selling outdoor goods two years
dialog: ago. You have his initials; MRC,
text: inside the wetsuit. The long hair
dialog: is distinctive, someone may
text: recognize him. It's a semi-long
dialog: shot.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: No, that's bread and butter
dialog: detective work. Thank you.
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: We should get upstairs.
text: They cross to the exit. Director Gillet barks orders in
text: FRENCH at his two-star Inspectors.
scene_heading: INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY
text: Photos, maps, newspaper articles cover the walls.
text: Twenty-four Hour News ON a TV. Six DETECTIVES man the
text: phones. ROOKIES fetch reports, pour coffee.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: The long table is crowded. Inspectors Laval and Reynaud.
text: Three more POLICE OFFICIALS. A pair of CITY COUNCILMEN.
text: Grace sits next to Gillet.
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #1
dialog: You found the skull. Incredible.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I had a case once where wild dogs
dialog: had removed remains.
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #2
dialog: So I can tell my people there
text: isn't a headhunter running around
dialog: the wilds of Quebec?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No headhunters, sir. However, a

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #1
dialog: Director Gillet. Do you have the
dialog: victim identified?
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: No name yet, sir. We have someone
dialog: from the University recreating his
text: face from the skull.
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #1
dialog: Why, after two years, has nobody
dialog: reported him missing?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: He wasn't missed. He had no
dialog: family, or moved often. He had
text: the musculature of a serious
dialog: outdoorsman. He spent a lot of
text: time in his kayak.
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #1
dialog: The big question is who killed
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Always is, sir. I can give you a
dialog: rough profile; white male, thirty
dialog: to thirty-four. Has some college
dialog: but no degree. Neat in
text: appearance. At least six feet
dialog: tall. Very intelligent. Charming
dialog: when necessary. He uses murder as
dialog: a tool, probably in furtherance of
text: a criminal endeavor. He's killed
dialog: before and will again unless
dialog: caught.
text: Laval and Reynaud write furiously. Gillet is impressed.
dialog: As are the Councilmen.
speaker_heading: COUNCILMAN #1
dialog: We really appreciate the FBI
dialog: sending you. When can we expect
dialog: your report?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: A couple days, sir.

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: This is more than we had. Thank

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: A very nice bed and breakfast. Grace enters and finds

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Vanderholt?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)
dialog: (filtered)

dialog: verified the ID.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: With a C?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)
dialog: (filtered)
scene_heading: No. K-O-H-L-E-R. The initials
dialog: are for the Montreal River
dialog: Company. Kohler worked there as a
dialog: guide three years ago. The owner
dialog: remembers him because he stole the
text: wetsuit.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Can you do a full records search?

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

text: Grace hangs up. Makes notes on the sketch. Slips it
text: into a picture frame.
scene_heading: INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY
text: Grace, Reynaud and Laval look through a haystack of
dialog: computer printouts for needles of information. Grace
text: stretches. Grabs a donut from a box. Offers the box to
dialog: Laval.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Fruit of the Gods. You know you
dialog: want one.
text: Laval gives in, takes a plain cake. She offers donuts to
text: Reynaud. He rubs his eyes, shoves aside papers, quietly
dialog: to Laval:
scene_heading: INSPECTOR REYNAUD
dialog: (subtitled French)
dialog: Let's take her down the street. I

scene_heading: INT. BISTRO - DAY
text: Locals only. The Inspector's favorite spot, they are

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Mr. Kohler has been dead two
dialog: years. No doubt about that.
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Very solid time of death. Two
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: So before he died he got his
dialog: paychecks, paid his taxes.
text: Patronized sporting goods stores.
dialog: And had long spending gaps where
dialog: he was enjoying the great
text: outdoors. That pattern continues
dialog: a year after his death. He gets
dialog: some paychecks. Rents an
dialog: apartment. Buys a three thousand
dialog: dollar kayak. Pays his taxes.
text: Dead and buried and still paying
text: his taxes. Then everything stops.
dialog: Last Visa charge was to
dialog: Travelocity for a plane ticket to
dialog: Mexico city.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Dead men don't pay their bills.
dialog: It's identity theft.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: This isn't someone renting limos
dialog: and fancy dinners on someone
dialog: else's credit. Lifestyle and
dialog: habits don't change.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Computer error?

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You really think a gangster is
text: going to break his stride and

dialog: guide? Inspector, this guy's

text: Laval and Reynaud trade looks.

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)
text: The lights are still on, Grace has fallen asleep on her

text: Crosses to the door, groggy. She checks the peephole.
text: Cracks the door. It's Inspector Laval.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: You are a heavy sleeper.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You're everywhere. What's up,
dialog: Laval?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: A man was killed tonight.
text: Attacked from behind. Asphyxiated

text: Reynaud places a HANDCUFFED MAN in workout gear in the
text: back of a cop car.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: That's him. He says he saw the

text: Reynaud SLAPS the cop car, it quickly drives away. Grace
text: and Laval arrive at a BODY dressed in sweats. A gym bag

text: processes the body. Thirty-ish, healthy, his generic
text: looks marred by bulging, bruised eyes. Face bruised.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Meet Mr. Todd Ford.
text: Grace squats by the body. CLICKS on her Mag-Lite and

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: GRACE

text: The Criminalist takes a lint roller, collects the hairs.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
text: There. Under his car.
text: Grace shines her light under a car. A garrote is there,
text: made of broomsticks and knotted nylon cord.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Holy shit. Has Le Directeur been
dialog: notified?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: I'm letting the poor man sleep a
dialog: couple more minutes.
dialog: (pointing things
dialog: out)
dialog: Twenty-four hour gym is there,
text: next door. He has a membership
dialog: card in his wallet. That's his
text: car. Car keys.
text: Grace looks around the garage. Taking it all in.
text: Getting a feel for the scene.
text: She carefully examines the victim's car with her

dialog: dust.
scene_heading: INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT (4:43 AM)
text: Director Gillet sips bad coffee in a rumpled suit and T-

scene_heading: INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT
text: JOHN COSTA, 33, sits at the small table. Glasses,

speaker_heading: COSTA
text: I walk out of the gym. Walk to my
text: car. I'm unlocking it and I hear
text: a scuffle, a fight. Over by this
dialog: car I see this guy getting choked
text: from behind and I shouted.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: What did you shout?
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: 'Stop.' I ran towards them. Then
dialog: the person doing the choking lets
text: go and pointed a gun at me and
dialog: ran. I'm so stupid. I could of

dialog: gave him CPR until the paramedics
dialog: came.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: You touched him?
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Of course. I was giving him CPR.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: You removed the Garrote?
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: The thing around his neck? Yes.
dialog: I took it off, it was choking him.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Did you see where the attacker
dialog: went?
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Away from me.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: What kind of gun did he have?
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: The kind that puts really big

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Was it black? Was it silver?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: A sketch. I can sketch him. I'm
dialog: very good.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: How could you see his face in the
dialog: dark?
text: A beat. Costa realizing he is under suspicion. He leans
text: forward, looks Inspector Laval in the eye.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: I did not do this. I saw two guys
dialog: fighting and should of ran the
dialog: other way but I didn't.
dialog: (as if to a child)
dialog: You need to find the person who
dialog: killed this man.
dialog: (in French)
dialog: You need to find the guy who did
dialog: this.
scene_heading: INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT
text: Grace doesn't like the turn.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You need to confirm he's a suspect
dialog: or clear him and kick-start a
dialog: manhunt based on Costa's ID. If
dialog: he is a legit witness, he'll get
text: heated up and start forgetting
dialog: details. I think there's a way to
text: clear him without pissing him off.
dialog: May I?
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Grace KNOCKS on the Interview room door.
speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: I was getting into his mind.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I have a shortcut. Can you get

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Sure. It's all on-line.

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: GRACE

dialog: school teachers, as many as you
dialog: can remember.
text: Costa looking at Grace a beat.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Are you kidding me? Lady, I saw

dialog: you're asking me about grade
dialog: school?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I apologize, I know it's random,
dialog: but it's the best way you can help

speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: I don't remember any of that.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Please, Mr. Costa. You'd be

speaker_heading: COSTA

dialog: don't know, Father Jeffrey. Mr.
dialog: Johansen. Oh, and Mrs. Sebastien,
text: she had a glass eye.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: May I?
text: She takes the list of names. She tips over her briefcase
text: with her foot, the evidence bag spills out. Costa
text: glances at the garrote, REACTS.
speaker_heading: COSTA

dialog: you. I did not do this. Grace.
dialog: I saw who did this and I can show
dialog: you what he looks like and you can
dialog: go catch him.
text: Costa is unambiguously sincere. Grace's attitude softens
text: a bit. She tucks the garrote back in her bag.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Go ahead and draw the face of the
dialog: man you saw.
text: Costa draws a simple smiley face. He shows her.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: We'll get an artist to help you.
speaker_heading: COSTA

text: Costa's list against his transcripts.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: You left a file in there.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I know. See if he tries to peek
dialog: in it. The real killer couldn't

dialog: we know.
text: Laval watches Costa.
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Here's his provincial driver's

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Have a nurse take a DNA sample.
dialog: Just to make sure his DNA isn't in

dialog: weird.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL

scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Costa has finished the sketch. He holds it up to the

speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
dialog: Fell out of his T-shirt when I

speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
dialog: West Vancouver Secondary School
dialog: Class of '95.
speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
dialog: No. I called the school and had

dialog: Here's the original owner's name.
dialog: But it could have been through a

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Keys drop straight down, how'd

dialog: car?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I had this case. This young

dialog: This guy? Nothing.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Everything you are saying, you are
dialog: saying one thing, do we trust
dialog: Costa?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Good question. Do we trust Costa?
text: An unmarked car pulls up. Reynaud drives.
scene_heading: INSPECTOR REYNAUD
dialog: Get in.
scene_heading: INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY
text: Grace and Laval get in, Reynaud guns it. Grace belts in.
scene_heading: INSPECTOR REYNAUD
dialog: I found a current address here in
dialog: Montreal.
text: Reynaud leans on the HORN, aggressively maneuvering
text: through traffic.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You guys have an extra weapon? I
dialog: didn't want to cross the border
dialog: armed.
scene_heading: INSPECTOR REYNAUD
text: The glove box.
text: Grace opens it and finds a compact Glock. She checks it,
text: shoves it into her pocket.
text: Reynaud swerves into the wrong lane. Stops cold in front
text: of an apartment building. And gets out. Great driving.
text: A mere two blocks away from the crime scene. Laval gets
text: out. Then Grace.
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
text: An upper floor. Grace, Reynaud and the MANAGER cross to
text: a door. The Manager studies Costa's sketch of the
dialog: attacker.
speaker_heading: SUPER
dialog: I never met him. We conducted our
dialog: business by phone.
text: They arrive at a door. Reynaud about to knock. Grace
text: stops him, listening at the door.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I smell smoke. Back where I'm
dialog: from anyone can kick a door if

dialog: 'citizen's arrest' of search
dialog: warrants.
text: Then: The SMOKE ALARM inside the apartment BUZZES O.S.
text: Reynaud and Laval trade looks. Reynaud cocks a leg...
text: The Manager unlocks the door a beat before Reynaud kicks
text: it. Laval is no danger junkie, he's a little hesitant to
text: enter. Grace gets down low, enters carefully, she knows
text: what she's doing.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - DAY
text: It's dark, drawn shades. A small studio. Reynaud and
text: Grace move tactically with drawn guns. Grace enters the
text: kitchen. Light smoke.
text: Reynaud approaches the futon, a person-sized shape under
text: the blankets. Reynaud whips aside the blanket. Just
dialog: pillows.
text: Grace checks under the sink.
text: Reynaud checks the bathroom and shower.
text: A coffee pot smokes, SIZZLING sludge on the bottom.
text: Grace checks around the fridge, now satisfied no one
text: lurks in there.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Clear.

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I bet Monsieur Edwards is in a

dialog: like Messieurs Kohler and Ford.
text: Which looks like all the victims.
text: Maybe he's subconsciously killing
dialog: himself.
text: Grace finds a guitar case. Opens it. It's a mobile
text: office; it has postage stamps. Postcards. Assorted
text: stationery, different address labels. Neat, organized.
text: Holiday cards. A CD titled: "Learn Flamenco Guitar."
text: Hundreds of practice signatures. Forged documents.
text: Victim's personal effects.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: We'll take that with us.
dialog: (in French)

dialog: Thinking.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Ever see a Hermit crab?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Yes, yes. They have one big claw

scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: We could have had him this
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Director, please. We are getting
text: close. The hairs recovered from
dialog: the apartment match the hairs
text: recovered at the crime scene on
dialog: Ford's body. We found hours of
dialog: video like that of the victim. He
dialog: has been following him, filming
text: him for weeks. He tapped his

text: calls. Even a CD with copies of
text: Mr. Ford's E-mail folders.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: With that much detail, you could
dialog: become anyone.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
text: So he hunts people and wears their

dialog: We can assume he has all sorts of
dialog: fake IDs and passports.
dialog: Disguises. But that's not enough
dialog: for him, he has to be someone

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: You're always thinking. Save

scene_heading: INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT
text: Grace enters. Costa sees her, REACTS, genuinely glad to

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Mr. Costa.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: You caught me.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Not yet.
text: Grace looks over the art.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Toussant Jean Bernard. I met him
dialog: in Haiti last year. Very troubled
dialog: life. Outlived all his children.
dialog: And he had ten. He lost his wife
text: to cancer and went blind. Passed
dialog: away last year.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Overpriced folk art. Is it the
dialog: work of a soul that has suffered?
dialog: Sure. Are his explorations as an
dialog: artist groundbreaking? No.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Ouch. And I was going to send you
dialog: two and charge them to your Amex.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I couldn't afford it.
text: Costa is looking at her, looking through her.
speaker_heading: COSTA

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Why, thank you. Agent Vanderholt.
dialog: (gives her a card)
dialog: I'm having a show Friday. You
dialog: should come by and meet some good
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Who knows. Where'd you learn CPR?
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Medical school. Before I dropped
dialog: out. I had a moment of clarity:
dialog: in anatomy class I realized I'd
dialog: rather draw bodies than cut them
dialog: up. And when I realized I couldn't
dialog: make art, I decided to sell it.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Some journey.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: It's taken me all over the world.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: About Monday again, did you see

speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: At first I thought I was

speaker_heading: GRACE

scene_heading: INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (6:03 A.M.)
text: The place is gearing up for a new day. Grace crosses to

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Morning. Can you run this name?

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL

text: Grace trades Reynaud for the front page.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Why a year ago.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Edwards went on a river trip.

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Those are E-mails between Kohler
dialog: and Edwards discussing the trip
dialog: one year ago.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You connected Edwards and Kohler?
dialog: Somebody was working all night.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: I couldn't sleep.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Our suspect kills Kohler on the
dialog: river, lives his life a year,
text: kills Edwards and assumes his ID
text: for a year. Then he stalks Ford,
text: kills him but is interrupted by
dialog: Costa. Think he's pissed at
dialog: Costa?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Of course.

dialog: Their fourteenth birthday?
scene_heading: MRS. ASHER
dialog: They were twins. Identical twins.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You said Reese was older.
scene_heading: MRS. ASHER
dialog: By three minutes. They were very
dialog: different boys.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: To lose one son so young, then to
dialog: lose the other two years later; to
dialog: think you've lost him. That must
dialog: have been devastating.
text: Mrs. Asher lights a cigarette. Crosses to the window, so
text: poised, so tragic. Grace studies her with a critical
dialog: eye.
scene_heading: MRS. ASHER
dialog: Reese was very charismatic and
dialog: outgoing. Martin was introverted.
dialog: He never thrived like Reese. He
dialog: was a very disturbed young man.
dialog: Reese was Martin's world. Martin
dialog: never recovered his equilibrium
dialog: after we lost him. He changed.
dialog: Martin began to intimidate me. He
dialog: could be very menacing. He began
text: imitating Reese at school and that
dialog: lead to fights with other
dialog: students. At sixteen he stole
dialog: some jewelry that was very
dialog: precious to me and ran away. A
dialog: few days later the Thunder Bay
dialog: police called and said my son had

scene_heading: INT. LES FRERS - NIGHT (1:29 AM)
text: Ultra-hip. The dance floor THROBS with CLUBGOERS. THE
text: DJ THUMPS a EUROBEAT.
text: Costa sits at the bar. PEOPLE all around him, jostling
text: to buy drinks. Two busy BARTENDERS sling booze.
text: Costa finds the noise and crowd absolutely nerve-
text: wracking. He twirls the ice in his Scotch with a finger.
text: Staring at the clock. 1:31 AM. He's nervous, sweat
text: beads his forehead. A big BARTENDER, an undercover cop,
text: pours Costa a Scotch.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Don't worry. You're doing fine.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Could you look any more like a
dialog: cop?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Could I have some water? I'm
dialog: cooking in this thing.
text: Costa scratches around the neck of the hot BODY ARMOR.
text: The Bartender gives him a Dasani.

scene_heading: INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT (1:53 AM)
text: Parked outside the club. Grace and Laval watch Costa via
text: the TV built into the dash.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Costa fits Asher's choice of
dialog: victims. Travels the World
dialog: looking for art. Single. No kids
dialog: or anything.

dialog: With all the patience in the

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: I wish I had his patience. He

dialog: kids.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You got kids?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Three.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Don't keep them in a cage.
scene_heading: INT. LES FRERS - NIGHT (2:03 AM)
text: Costa looks miserable. Overheating, anxiously nursing
text: his water. He looks around. Then REACTS. A note sits
text: on the bar top. Right in front of him. Costa looks
text: around. Only sees strange faces.
text: Costa carefully unfolds the note. It reads: "MEET ME IN
scene_heading: THE RESTROOM NOW."
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Costa walks down a narrow hallway. Paint peeling. MUSIC
text: MUTED. Red light bulbs hanging from the ceiling.
text: Approaching the men's room, Costa looks over his
text: shoulder. No one is watching.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Costa cautiously pushes open the door. Stepping inside.
text: Dingy tiles. DRIPPING FAUCET. Several stalls.
text: The room seems empty. Costa swallows, bends down.
text: Checks under the stalls. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing...
text: Then. Something. At the far stall. A pair of men's
text: shoes. Black. Polished. Facing the stall door.
dialog: Waiting...
text: Costa freezes. Backs away as...
text: The stall door slowly swings open. HINGES CREAK. A
text: foot, a trouser cuff. A leg stepping out...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: A BLACK MAN emerges. One of the guys at the end of the

speaker_heading: BLACK MAN

speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: We're calling it off.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE CLUB - NIGHT
text: Costa bursts from the fire exit, fed up. He rips off the
text: wire, he struggles out of the body armor. Grace and
text: Laval watching.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: I have a life. I can't play
dialog: superhero for you. I don't handle
dialog: stress very well. I have an art
dialog: show to open tomorrow and I don't
dialog: know what I'm putting on the walls
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I know you have a life. So did
dialog: the people who have lost theirs.
dialog: Someone else might die if you do
dialog: not help us. Every time someone
dialog: dies it affects forty, fifty
dialog: lives.
text: Costa looks at her, arms on his hips.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Grace, I've been cooperating. I
dialog: even drew you a picture. You
dialog: can't put your responsibility on
dialog: me. You have a badge, not me.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: If somebody else dies, and you
dialog: know you could have done more to
dialog: stop it, you're going to feel like
dialog: shit for a very long time, Mr.

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's okay to be scared.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Scared? I'm off-the-charts
text: terrified. There's a pissed-off
dialog: serial killer after me. I mean,
dialog: what did I do to him?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You saw him and that's enough.
dialog: Don't stop living your life.
dialog: You'll be protected by armed
dialog: officers twenty-four seven.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Until he's caught?
speaker_heading: GRACE

scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I'm sure Soulsby's death was a
dialog: homicide, Asher saw the
dialog: opportunity and took it. He
text: became Soulsby and bummed around
dialog: Seattle for a couple years.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: Why is Asher after Costa? Why
dialog: isn't he in Mexico getting a new
dialog: face?
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: Costa saw him. Costa caught him
dialog: in the act, caught him being
dialog: Martin Asher. Seen first by his
dialog: mother, then by Costa. For the
dialog: first time he's failed at taking a
dialog: life, and since we found the
dialog: apartment, he can't be Edwards.
dialog: To be seen, to be recognized, is a
dialog: horrifying thing to Asher. He has
dialog: no identity and wants it that way.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: Where is the real Mr. Edwards?
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: Likely dead and buried south of
text: the border somewhere.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: South of the American border
dialog: somewhere. Visa records put
text: Asher, using Kohler's ID and
text: Edwards at a Mexican surf resort.
dialog: Edwards' last charge was sixteen
dialog: hundred dollars at a 'no questions
dialog: asked' facelift clinic in
dialog: Guadalajara.
text: Director Gillet taps out his pipe. Looks at a new, more
text: detailed portrait of Asher.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: Have you contacted the clinic?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR LAVAL
dialog: Yes. They are also 'no questions

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: He's focused on Costa. Who fits

text: He went on Costa's computer and E-
dialog: mailed copies of Costa's files to
text: an E-mail account in Denmark.
dialog: Constant threat of discovery,
dialog: Asher will become more
text: disorganized.
text: Laval and Reynaud agree.
scene_heading: DIRECTOR GILLET
dialog: Okay. My office will arrange a
dialog: press conference. I will tell a
dialog: room full of correspondents we

speaker_heading: COSTA

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: COSTA

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh. Okay. Why the borders?
dialog: Almost every painting has one.
dialog: Was he in prison or something?
text: Costa REACTS, impressed by Grace.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Most people don't notice. This is

text: From his own blood.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: What was his crime?
speaker_heading: COSTA

text: Grace taking everything in. Art books, sketch pads.
text: Piled high on the desk. She looks at the ceiling. SEES

speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: I'm sorry. It's a sty. Must be a

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I'm done profiling you. I got you
dialog: figured out.
speaker_heading: COSTA
text: A failed healer, a failed artist.
text: Grace looking at a drawing on the wall. Costa winces, he

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Is that how you see yourself?
speaker_heading: COSTA

speaker_heading: COSTA

text: giggling.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I don't know. John, games are
dialog: fun. But head games are

speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Then keep your head out of it.
text: A beat. Grace shrugs, back to business.
speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: COSTA

speaker_heading: COSTA

speaker_heading: COSTA

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: COSTA

speaker_heading: COSTA

speaker_heading: Costa REACTS.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't know.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Growing up I quit speaking after
dialog: that. I didn't say a word for
dialog: three years. When you're not in
dialog: the conversation, you get
dialog: forgotten real quick. So I'd
dialog: watch people. Study them. The

speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: How'd you get your voice back?
speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Why did your Uncle do it?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Land. Great-grandpa owned half of
dialog: Pennsylvania. My Uncle wanted
dialog: control and sold it all. All
text: that's left is an old farmhouse
text: and a horse pasture.
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: My father's murderer got away with

speaker_heading: COSTA

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: Costa REACTS.
speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Can we please forget about him?
speaker_heading: GRACE

text: Two mouths. Inches apart. Costa's hand reaches up her
text: skirt. Exploring. Grace swallows. His hand reaching
text: into her panties.
text: Grace's eyes looking away. As she grabs his arm.
text: Pulling. Pushing. Wanting. Her mouth. Avoiding his.
text: Their breath mingling. Until. Costa's lips crush down
text: on hers. The kiss devouring. Knocking pictures off the

text: Costa picks her up. Throws her on the bed. He tears at

text: Her legs wrapping around him. As her eyes flutter open.
text: Looking up at the ceiling, she gasps.
text: Costa stops. Turns. To see what she's looking at.

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: GRACE (V.O.)

text: Grace chasing Hart.
speaker_heading: SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)
dialog: Mr. Hart, not Asher, murdered the

speaker_heading: GRACE (V.O.)
dialog: Yes. Hart thought Costa was

dialog: was inevitable.
speaker_heading: SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)
dialog: How could Asher plan on Hart
dialog: snapping like that?
speaker_heading: GRACE (V.O.)
dialog: He couldn't. My guess is Asher
dialog: intended to kill Hart and make it

scene_heading: INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - THE NEXT DAY (PRESENT)
text: Things are wrapping up.

dialog: life, Grace. Please listen to me,
dialog: Grace. I have a proposal.
text: Asher takes out a couple passports, a pair of driver's
dialog: licenses.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: You become her. I become him. We
dialog: are married, see?
text: Asher slides a woman's wedding ring across the table.
text: Already inscribed.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: We have the babies. We raise
dialog: them. However you want. I just
dialog: want to be with you.
text: Grace looking at Asher, not sure whether to laugh out
text: loud or start crying. He seems edgy; he needs her
dialog: decision quick.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: What happens if I don't want to
dialog: assume this woman's identity and
dialog: raise my babies with a serial
dialog: killer?
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: Grace, don't be morbid. If anyone
dialog: can deal with this, you can. I
dialog: know you felt what I felt. It's
dialog: real.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Answer my question.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: I'll shoot you in the head and
dialog: burn this place down.
text: Grace reacts. She can respect that. Grace looking at
text: Asher. He's scary, feeding off some fantasy about her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You'll do what you have to do. I
dialog: can respect that. How do you know
text: it's still real? Maybe it's gone.
dialog: What we felt.
text: Grace tilts her lips, looking in his eyes. Asher leans
text: over to kiss her. Slow, delicate. Asher kneels beside
text: her, the kisses become hungry, desperate.
text: Grace's eyes are so open, so vulnerable.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: God, I missed you so much.
text: Asher leans in to kiss her...
text: Grace head-butts him. CRUNCH! Smashes his nose.
text: She drives her feet down and her shoulder into his chest.
text: Asher, already on his knees, falls back.
text: Grace scrambles over him, gets out of the chair. She
text: shoulders over the kitchen table...
text: There is a holster mounted underneath the table.
text: Grace turns her back so she can grab the gun from it.
text: Grace REACTS. There is no gun in the holster.
text: Asher looking at her, matter of fact:
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: I searched everything.
text: Asher stands, reaches for the Glock on the counter.
text: Grace can't let him get it. She lunges at Asher,
text: collides into his knees, hurting him.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: Damn you!
text: Asher grabs a large knife from the butcher's block.
text: THWACK! Plunges it into Grace's belly.
text: Grace GASPS, looking at the knife embedded in her stomach.
text: A beat as Grace and Asher stare at the knife.
text: Grace uses the pause to kick away from Asher. She gets
text: on her feet and runs from the kitchen.
dialog: 113.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Grace exits the kitchen door, running with her hands
text: cuffed behind her. Running for her life.
text: She runs for the nearby woods. Her shoes CRUNCHING
text: through a layer of fresh ice over old snow. Fighting for
dialog: balance.
text: POP-POP-POP! Asher OPENS FIRE on her from the house.
text: BULLETS HIT the ice around her.
text: Grace runs into the woods. Branches sheathed in ice.
text: Smacking her face.
text: Asher exits the house, FIRING -- POP-POP-POP-POP!
text: BULLETS EXPLODE the ice around Grace. She dives to the
text: ground. She takes the opportunity to move her handcuffs
text: from behind to in front.
text: She unties and removes the heavy prosthetic belly she
text: wears. Grace is not pregnant. She pulls the knife out.
text: Grace runs deeper into the woods.
text: Asher running in the woods behind her. The gun in his
text: hand at the ready. Asher is hunting. He intends to kill
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: Keep fucking running, Grace,
dialog: you're only going to die tired!
speaker_heading: ON GRACE
text: Running. Batting away ice-covered branches. Drenched
text: with sleet. Hypothermic conditions.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT
text: Grace emerges from the woods. Running along the icy
text: road. She slips and falls. Cuts her hand on the ice.
text: Grace stands, and keeps running, her hand bleeding, the
text: knife getting slippery.
speaker_heading: ON ASHER
text: Gaining on her. Grace slips again, scrabbling on the
text: ice, trying to keep moving. A slow motion nightmare.
text: Here comes Asher. No mercy. He aims the gun at her
dialog: face...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Grace raises her hands to protect her face...
text: POP! Asher FIRES. DING! The BULLET intended for
text: Grace's forehead hits the knife -- RICOCHETS into the
dialog: trees.
text: A beat. Grace looking at the now-creased knife.
text: Asher's gun is out of rounds. The slide is locked back
text: on an empty chamber.
text: SWICK! Grace slices Asher's legs with the knife. Slices
text: each shin deeply.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: Shit!
text: Asher kicks the knife from her hand. Then kicks her in
text: the face. He tries to kick her again but she grabs his
dialog: leg.
text: WHAM! Asher slips, hits the ice hard. Grace is on top
text: of him, wraps the handcuffs around his neck. Wraps her
text: legs around his body.
text: Grace chokes Asher for all he's worth. His eyes bulge,
text: his face reddens as he meets the same fate as his
text: victims. Asher has a seizure as his oxygen depleted
text: brain dies.
text: Grace doesn't let go. A long death embrace. Finally,
text: when she is sure, Grace releases from Martin Asher's
dialog: body.
text: She checks his pulse. He's dead. Grace stands.
text: The rain falling on her. Ice and moonlight. Grace spits
text: blood, looks around. Looks at Asher's corpse.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Better you than me, asshole.
text: Walks back toward the house. Alone. Strong. Whole.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
