scene_heading: EXT. DUCK MARSH - DAWN
text: JACK RUSSELL and his 18-year-old son, GEORGE, crouch in a
text: makeshift cattail blind. Roosting ducks are dropping into
text: the marsh. on the water floats an arrangement of duck
text: decoys which have lured the ducks to the pond.
text: In the blind, Jack holds a long-barrel, semi-automatic
text: shotgun. George mans a sealed-beam car-light hooked to a
text: portable car battery. The light is not yet shining. Jack
text: peeks through at the ducks while George keeps his head down,
text: checking and retwisting the connections to the battery.
text: It’s mid-June on the northern Montana Hi-line, and it’s
text: chilly as the sky barely lightens eastward. The ducks :
text: settle and the marsh goes quiet. Jack, in the blind, takes
text: _a long, deep breath, squeezes off the safety of his shotgun,
text: regards his son beside hin.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shine, George. Shine now.
text: George clicks the crude switch on the car-light and the
text: yellow beam streams out onto the marsh surface through the
text: cattails. The ducks are there, all of them on the water,
text: completely exposed and not yet alarmed by the light. Jack
text: stands and begins shooting down on the water with the
text: shotgun, methodical shooting, not fast, but gauged to cover
text: as much of the water as he can. Most of the ducks are hit
text: sitting in the water, but some fall just as they begin to
text: lift off. Jack shoots, in all, eleven times. On the water
text: after the last gun blast, there are 54 ducks dead or dying.
speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: Well. There’s that.
