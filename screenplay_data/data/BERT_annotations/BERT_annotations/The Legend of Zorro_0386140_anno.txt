scene_heading: THE LEGEND OF ZORRO
dialog: By
dialog: Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman
dialog: Fourth Draft / Production
speaker_heading: 6/2/04
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: In the darkness, a single shaft of light. First we HEAR
text: FOOTSTEPS, then we see a familiar silhouette approaching:
text: ZORRO! Drawing his sword, he SLASHES the screen, forming the
text: letter "Z" through which FLAMES EXPLODE and --
scene_heading: INT. DARKENED CAVE - DAY 1
text: As the flames dissipate, we're left with a single plume of
text: smoke. BOOM DOWN to a flickering candle. A YOUNG MAN
text: appears, his face obscured in shadow. He sits at the table.
text: Picks up a QUILL. Dips it in a bottle of INK. As the quill
text: Moves across the page, we hear his VOICE:
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.0.)
dialog: It is my desire to put on record
dialog: these events, which did shape the
dialog: course of my destiny...
text: A drop of INK falls from his quill onto the page, right next
text: to the word... “DESTINY.” A pinpoint of light appears inside
text: the letter ‘D‘ -- it quickly CONSUMES THE FRAME...
scene_heading: WHITEWASHING US TO:
scene_heading: INT. MISSION SANTA LUCIA - THE BELFRY - DAY 2
text: The blazing sun. CRANE DOWN to the iron mission bell as it
text: CLANGS, swinging back and forth:
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (V.0.)
dialog: «-- They begin in San Mateo, the
dialog: province of my birth. On that day,
dialog: the people would decide if
dialog: California was to join the union as
dialog: its thirty first state.
text: We MOVE down the bell rope, to find a MONK tugging it.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: «+. Brother Ignacio?
text: The monk turns to see FRAY FELIPE, curator of the mission.
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BROTHER IGNACIO
dialog: Five rings, Padre -- to summon
dialog: Zorro in case there’s trouble.
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: If I know Zorro... he‘s already
dialog: here.
text: And as he exits, we TRACK through the open archway and TILT
text: DOWN in a glorious reveal to find a CROWD OF HUNDREDS. A
text: banner reads: “VOTE TODAY!" SHOT CONTINUES over long lines
dialog: of people waiting to cast their votes...
text: And we STOP ON THREE SOMBREROS. Or, more specifically, three
text: PEASANTS inside curtained voting booths. MOVE IN on their
text: ballots. Two boxes, two choices: “IN PAVOR OF THE
scene_heading: CONSTITUTION” / “IN OPPOSITION TO THE CONSTITUTION.” The
text: first peasant marks an “X" in favor of joining the union.
text: TRACK to the next peasant -- he does too. Now we come to the
text: third. And instead of marking an ”X,” this peasant marks a
text: "Z." TILT UP TO ROGUISH EYES BEHIND A BLACK MASK...
dialog: --- ZORRO. To those who know his secrets, he’s ALEJANDRO DE
text: LA VEGA. Disguised as a peasant, he opens the curtain, drops
text: the ballot in a basket, and as he LEAVES FRAME we begin...
text: TRACKING along a row of MEN shouting from soapboxes, a kind
dialog: of ‘speaker’s corner’ -- activists both for and against the
text: vote -- we STOP on a MAN handing out leaflets: GUILLERMO
text: CORTEZ, a young Che Guevara with a revolutionary’s passion:
speaker_heading: CORTEZ
dialog: Vote ‘yes’ to atatehood! This is
dialog: our day of independence! our day
dialog: of revolution!
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - ABOVE THE SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 3
text: CLOSE ON A MAN‘S EYES, filled with hate, watching the crowd
text: through a window. His hands sweep twin PISTOLS off a table.
text: Burnished into one handle we read: “SALVATION.” Into the
text: other, “DAMNATION.” Now he reaches for a RIFLE BANDOLIER.
text: Slings the strap over his back. Turns to a CRACKED MIRROR -—-
text: and his face is revealed like a kaleidoscopic horror show:
text: JACOB McGIVENS, lean, fierce, a deadly piece of trouble in a
text: black frock coat and flat-brimmed hat. The shape of a
text: CRUCIFIX has been BRANDED into his cheek, clear through his
text: right eye, and onto his forehead. McGivens slips on the hat
text: and exits... a warrior going into battle.
scene_heading: EXT. MISSION SANTA LUCIA - DAY 4
text: In the crowd, we find a 10 YEAR-OLD BOY...
text: A wildness about him ~- like a colt ready to run. As he
text: pushes through the voters, a HAND grabs his ear -~ he WINCES
text: and looks up at:
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Nifio, why aren’t you at school?!
speaker_heading: THE BOY
dialog: But Padre, what if Zorro comes?
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: I'll make sure he carves a ‘Z’' into
dialog: your backside, now how does that
dialog: sound?
speaker_heading: THE BOY
dialog: (excited by the prospect)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
speaker_heading: HOME!
text: The boy runs off. Shaking his head, Felipe scoops up the a
text: basket filled with votes, heads off. As he clears frame...
text: «.. we FIND the corner where the kid just disappeared. After
text: a beat, his face REAPPEARS and he sneaks back into the crowd,
text: passing a FRUIT CART. Stealing an APPLE, he creeps on as...
text: FRAY FELIPE arrives at a table where the GOVERNOR'S TABULATOR
text: is counting ballots, calculating the results on a TALLY
text: CERTIFICATE. Two uniformed RURALES stand beside him, rifles
text: in hand. Felipe sets down the basket...
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: The final votes, Amigo.
text: TRACK ON TO A YOUNG WOMAN. Very pregnant, sweating in the
text: sun. This is BLANCA CORTEZ, wife to Guillermo Cortez, the
text: revolutionary we just met. Seeing her lower herself to sit,
text: Cortez hops off his soapbox and runs over, concerned:
speaker_heading: CORTEZ
dialog: Are you all right, Mi Amor?
speaker_heading: BLANCA
dialog: The baby’s kicking, that’s all.
speaker_heading: CORTEZ
dialog: Here, have some water...
text: It’s easy to see the love between them.
text: Now our camera REACQUIRES the Tabulator -- he locks the tally
text: e certificate inside a BOX and says to Felipe:
speaker_heading: TABULATOR
dialog: Once we get this to the governor,
dialog: it’1ll be official -- let's hope the
dialog: rest of California voted the same,
dialog: eh?
text: He hands the box to one of the Rurales, who loads it onto a
dialog: wagon. Felipe cautions the Rurale:
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Be careful, Hombre, you carry the
dialog: future of our state in your hands.
text: SUDDENLY, A MAN’S VOICE SINGS through the courtyard:
speaker_heading: MAN‘S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: ‘How glorious is our heavenly King,
dialog: Who reigns above the sky...
dialog: How shall a child presume to sing,
dialog: His dreadful majesty?’
text: And now the crowd has parted to reveal...
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: e I come to deliver The Lord’s word
dialog: against this vote! Babylon waa
dialog: condemned to ashes for extending
dialog: its empire to inferior races!
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: What right do you have to preach
dialog: gospel, McGivens!? You speak for
dialog: the railroad!
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
text: (touching his crucifix
dialog: scar)
dialog: Here’s my right... just as He sent
dialog: his only son to endure mortal
dialog: suffering, my daddy branded me with
dialog: my own cross to bear.
text: Cortez SPITS at McGivens’ boots:
speaker_heading: CORTEZ
dialog: You force us to sell our land then
dialog: use us as slave labor! You can‘t
dialog: intimidate us anymore!
dialog: ® A swell of CHEERS!
text: McGivens draws back his coat to emphasize his PISTOLS. The
text: e Rurales quickly level their rifles. Everyone tenses --
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: My my, it’s damnably hot out
dialog: here... I believe the devil is upon
dialog: us. Now what say you hand over
dialog: that ballot box.
speaker_heading: TABULATOR
dialog: A pointless crime, Sir, you'd only
dialog: force the people to vote again.
text: With a fearless grin, McGivens SNAPS: the SOUND OF MULTIPLE
text: MUSKETS COCKING fills the square. We WHIP to SIX RIFLEMEN on
text: the rooftops, McGivens' posse, surrounding the courtyard.
text: The Rurales freeze, finding themselves gravely outnumbered.
text: Tenge beats. The frightened people. Among them, the young
text: boy. Finally, with no choice, the Rurales drop their guns...
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: With the proper persuadin’, people
dialog: got a funny way of having their
dialog: minds changed. Savvy?
speaker_heading: TABULATOR
dialog: eS I command you, in the name of civil
dialog: erder -- tell your men to disarm.
text: In a flash, McGivens unslings his RIFLE from its bandolier
text: and FIRES OFF TWELVE ROUNDS AT ONCE, pockmarking the wall
text: around the tabulator’s head and the suspender straps on his
text: shoulders -- causing his pants to drop to the ground. No
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Latest model in heavy artillery --
dialog: the Henry repeating rifle. If God
dialog: didn’t hurl lightning he’d surely
dialog: carry one of these. Now, I’m gonna
dialog: count to ‘one’...
text: He COCKS the rifle again, aims at the terrified tabulator...
text: and as McGivens opens his mouth to say ‘One’... A BLACK
text: FEDORA ROCKETS THROUGH THE AIR, STRIKING HIM ON THE BRIDGE OF
text: THE NOSE. He tumbles off his horse and lands in the dust...
text: SNAP TO ZORRO, standing on a rooftop -- he WAVES to the
text: crowd. The people RO. ~- among them, the boy, who’s beyond
dialog: gleeful with exhilaration!
text: Zorro leaps off the roof onto the balcony below, the posse
text: SHOOTING AT HIM as he goes --
text: McGivens pulls himself up off the ground, enraged, firing
text: double-fisted into the air to clear a path to the wagon.
text: Leaping on, an APPLE CORE splats the side of his head -- he
text: WHIRLS to see the boy, having flung the apple with a
scene_heading: SLINGSHOT -—-
text: McGivens locks eyes with the boy as he contemplates bloody
text: murder, but there’s no time to spare -- McGivens CRACKS the
text: reins AND BLASTS AWAY CARRYING THE LOCK BOX!
speaker_heading: TABULATOR
dialog: He’s getting away with the ballots!
text: The posse leaps from the rooftops onto waiting horses,
text: galloping after the wagon as it thunders through the fleeing
text: peasants, heading straight for A FRIGHTENED LITTLE GIRL!
text: Across the square, her hysterical mother’s been cut off by
text: the frantic crowd. Zorro LEAPS from the roof -- catching a
text: HANGING BANNER, he SWINGS over the crowd, snatching up the
text: girl MERE SECONDS before she’s run over by the wagon...
text: Zorro deposits the girl right into her mother’s arms, then
text: whistles: [ADO CHARG: INTO VIEW! Zorro LEAPS on, racing
text: after the posse -~ as he clears frame, we HOLD ON:
text: TWO _DARK-SUITED MEN. Notably out of place in the peasant
text: crowd. Who are they? Without a word, they climb onto their
text: horses and follow, passing...
text: .+. Fray Felipe, in the crush of peasants -- he picks Zorro's
text: Fedora off the ground and HANDS IT TO HIM as he races by.
text: Watching him go, Felipe kisses a CRUCIFIX NECKLACE:
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Godspeed, Alejandro --
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF SAN MATEO - MARKETPLACE ~ CONTINUOUS 5
text: McGivens races the wagon through a MARKETPLACE, tearing
text: through hanging clothes, hens, vegetable carts -- havoc,
text: panic and destruction in every direction. He turns to see if
text: Zzorro’s following. He isn’t. Grinning, McGivens wheels back
text: around to face the road ahead but:
text: ZORRO APPEARS IN FRONT OF HIM, ROUNDING A CORNER ON TORNADO!
text: Leaping off, he catches hold of an INDUSTRIAL HOOK AND ROPE
text: and THROWS IT under the wagon -- it catches an AXLE -- the
text: rope uncoils then GOES TAUT, FLIPPING THE WAGON OVER.
text: McGivens goes FLYING; so does the lock box, which lands in
text: Zorro’s hands. He grabs a nearby rope and swings onto A_
text: VIADUCT UNDER REPAIR. Zorro lands perfectly on MULTI-LAYERED
text: SCAFFOLDING. Just as he finds his feet, McGivens’ posse
text: converges around him and...
text: A_FIGHT ON THE SCAFFOLDING ENSUES, Zorro attacking and
text: defending, dodging bullets, slashing the ropes binding the
text: scaffolding together -- and it COLLAPSES, sending the posse
text: down into the water below.
text: As Zorro whirls, McGivens’ FIST knocks him back. The box
text: skids away. The men exchange deadly blows on what remains of
text: the scaffolding, tumbling together from landing to landing --
text: McGivens plunges a KNIFE but Zorro grabs his wrist:
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
text: Only the Devil hides his face from
dialog: God!
text: Teeth clenched, Zorro struggles as McGivens presses the blade
text: CLOSER TO THE STRAP SECURING HIS MASK, threatening to expose
text: Alejandro’s identity... AND FINALLY HE CUTS IT!
text: But just as the mask FALLS OFF, Zorro SLAMS McGivens in the
text: gut -- he CRASHES back onto one end of the plank.
text: Zorro reaches for his mask but IT FLUTTERS AWAY! As McGivens
text: rises, Zorro leapa -- the other end of the plank SNAPS UP
text: like a see-saw, SLAMMING RIGHT INTO McGIVENS’ FACE AND --
dialog: ie] FLIES _0: E Fi !
text: The bloody teeth land at Zorro’s feet. He tears a shred of
text: black cloth from his sleeve, then draws his dagger and SLICES
text: EYEHOLES. Scooping the box under hia arm, he SWINGS back to
text: Tornado, landing perfectly in the saddle:
speaker_heading: ZORRO
text: Over the hill to the governor's
dialog: mansion!
dialog: (the horse doesn’t move)
dialog: I said, over the hill to the
dialog: governor’s mansion!
text: Nothing. Zorro sighs, and repeats ~- this time, in Spanish:
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: Sobre la colina a la mansién del
dialog: gobernador.
speaker_heading: (and as Tornado PLUNGES
dialog: forward: )
dialog: We have to work on your English --
text: As they clear frame, we RACK FOCUS to reveal... THE DARK-
text: SUITED MEN. Watching from the brush.
scene_heading: EXT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION - SAN MATEO - DAY 6
text: A CROWD waits anxiously at the gates. A MURMUR growa: they
text: see their hero approaching...
speaker_heading: THE CROWD
dialog: ZORRO! MIRA, EL ZORRO!
text: Zorro rides through the gates. Waiting on the front steps is
text: CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR BENNET RILEY, his AIDE beside him.
text: Seeing Zorro, Riley's stunned, and cautious:
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR RILEY
dialog: Where are my men?
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: They were held up, Governor. I
dialog: offered my help.
text: Dismounting, he hands the lock box to the governor, who opens
text: it and quickly sifts through the tally certificates. Each
text: bears the same verdict. And so, Riley announces:
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR RILEY
dialog: Citizens of San Mateo, we are no
dialog: longer simply Californians... we
dialog: are now Americans!
text: The crowd ERUPTS. Sombreros FLY. A great celebration is
text: taking place. The governor offers a hand to Zorro:
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR RILEY (CONT’D)
dialog: The people owe you their freedom.
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: I accept no debts from the people,
dialog: Governor... I’m one of them.
text: And in a grand gesture, Zorro draws his sword and REARS UP ON
text: TORNADO! Cape billowing -- an icon -- as the CHEERING
text: SWELLS. Finally, Zorro gallops off. And in an instant, he
dialog: has disappeared...
scene_heading: EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT - DUSK 7
text: An epic vista of the west: the De La Vega hacienda,
text: surrounded by beautiful countryside. In the distance, we see
dialog: San Francisco and the sea...
dialog: 10
scene_heading: EXT. DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - DUSK 8
text: Zorro guides Tornado through a shallow pond, past the sparse
text: silhouette of a HUGE TREE....
scene_heading: INT. DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - SECRET CAVE - NIGHT 9
text: In the privacy of his lair, Alejandro removes his mask and
text: closes Tornado in a stall, feeding him a sugar cube. As he
text: turns to go, Tornado WHINNIES for more...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Eh, eh -- your saddle’s getting a
dialog: little tight, Amigo.
text: He gives Tornado a carrot and walks away. A beat, then the
text: carrot SAILS past Alejandro’s head.
text: In the doorway, a WOMAN appears in silhouette. And we can
text: tell just by the contours of her face, she may in fact be the
dialog: most beautiful one in the world...
text: ELENA DE LA VEGA steps into the LIGHT. They look at each
text: other a long moment... and they KISS, and it’s a passionate,
text: hungry one that tells us how desperately in love they are.
text: Finally, she pulls back...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Tell me we won... tell me we’re
dialog: free.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: «-. We’re free.
text: She wraps her arms around him, wanting to laugh as much as
dialog: she needa to cry. After a beat...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Where’s Joaquin?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: He wasn‘t feeling well this
text: morning, he’s been asleep all day.
scene_heading: INT. HACIENDA — BEDROOM/ HALLWAY ~ NIGHT 10
text: Under the sheets is the sleeping form of a child. A window
text: swings open -- a YOUNG BOY appears, climbing a tree and
text: tumbling into the room.
dialog: 11
dialog: 
dialog: We h 0 x
dialog: JOAQUIN DE LA VEGA, son to Alejandro and Elen
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As Joaguin finds his feet, he hears his PARENTS’ FOOTSTEPS
text: outside the door. Racing to the bed, he hurls back the
text: sheets to reveal the ‘sleeping form’ is a stack of pillows.
text: Jumping in, he pulls up the covers as the doorknob turns...
text: Elena and Alejandro enter quietly. Joaquin’s the portrait of
text: angelic innocence: eyes closed, a little bead of sweat on his
text: brow. Alejandro gently brushes it away...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
text: His fever’s breaking.
text: Elena moves to close the window. Stops, confused...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I thought I closed this.
text: Alert, Joaquin begins to MOAN, drawing her attention away...
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: +-. Mama? Is that you?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (leans in, kisses him)
dialog: Shh, go back to sleep, Mi Amor.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: We’1l leave the light on, eh?
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: I'm too old for that.
text: Alejandro grins and turns down the kerosene lamp, the flame
text: low. Kisaing his son, he heads out with Elena. His parents
text: gone, Joaquin turns the lamp back up -- he’s still afraid of
text: the dark after all. And with a sneaky little grin, he
text: settles in to sleep.
scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE JOAQUIN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 11
text: In the hallway, Elena smiles a sexy smile, whispers, close...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: We’ll have to be quiet.
text: And now Alejandro’s smiling too, because he knows what she's
dialog: getting at. A sweet, hot moment...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: +++ Oh, bless the silence.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: 12 INT. DE LA VEGA HACIENDA ~ PARLOR - NIGHT 12
text: MOVING over articles of clothing left scattered in the heat
text: of passion, we find Elena and Alejandro curled under a
text: blanket by the fireplace. She reaches over, pours from a
text: bottle of tequila -- two shots.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: To statehood.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: --. To us.
dialog: (they clink, then)
dialog: I wish I could have been there.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: +e. You were.
text: He’s lost in her. They sling back their shots, she nuzzles
text: into his chest. A warm moment...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: For ten years we‘ve been dreaming
dialog: of a day when the law would protect
dialog: the people.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: eS We can finally take Joaquin on a
dialog: trip to Spain. I can’t imagine how
dialog: it’s changed since I left...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Elena... I’ve been thinking.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (good natured)
dialog: Never a good sign.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: I'd love us to go, but it may be
dialog: some time before the new laws are
dialog: in place...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: «.. What are you saying?
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Only that the Federal Marshals may
dialog: need help getting things under
dialog: control...
text: . She sits up, alert --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Alejandro, we agreed when
dialog: California became a state you’d
dialog: give it up --
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: And I will, no doubt about it,
dialog: soon, very soon ~-—
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: You’ve been saying that since
dialog: Joaquin was born --
speaker_heading: BLEJANDRO
dialog: (gestures, with his hands)
dialog: Yes, but look: here’s me... here’s
dialog: quitting -- we’re this far apart --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Is that right? Well here’s you...
dialog: and here’s me strangling you!
text: Joaquin’s on the verge of becoming
dialog: a man and you’re missing it!
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: I’m not missing anything!
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Oh, really? What's his teacher’s
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: That's easy, Mr. --
dialog: {she shakes her head:
dialog: wrong)
dialog: Brother -~-
dialog: {again: wrong)
dialog: Father! Father Kin...
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: «+. jin... hoofer...
text: She’s glaring at him, her point made.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Okay, so I have a bad memory,

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: What instrument has he been
dialog: learning?
dialog: 12.

dialog: (she shakes her head:
dialog: wrong)
dialog: Guitar!
dialog: (again: wrong)
dialog: The triangle?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: He doesn't play an instrument!
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: (caught, angry)
dialog: Are you saying I’m a bad father?!
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I’m saying you can only be great at
dialog: one thing, Alejandro: wearing the
dialog: mask, or raising our son... you
dialog: can‘t do both.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: So you'd let Joaquin go on
dialog: believing I’m nothing more than a
dialog: wealthy Don who only cares about
dialog: ordering servants around?!
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Is that what you think I do all
dialog: day?! Order servants around?!
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Now you’re putting words in my
dialog: mouth ~-
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: That‘s your foot you're tasting!
dialog: You promised me this would end!
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: And I promised your father Zorro
dialog: would never abandon the people!
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: My father died because he wore that
dialog: mask!
text: In the distance, the CHURCH BELL RINGS to summon Zorro. A
dialog: ‘perfect timing’ moment if there ever was one. Finally...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: It‘s who I am, Elena.
dialog: 13
dialog: 15
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: If you walk out that door take a
dialog: change of clothes, because you
dialog: won’t be sleeping here tonight.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: +--+ What happened to the woman who
dialog: fought by my side?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I’m fighting now, for my family.
text: And she’s right. The bell RINGS AGAIN. A terrible moment.
text: He’s desperately torn. Finally...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: I‘ll make it up to you, I promise.
text: And he leaves her there, her heart sinking, off which --
scene_heading: EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - NIGHT 13
text: Zorro and Tornado WHIP through frame, galloping off toward
text: the ringing bell. Zorro pulls up at the top of the hill,
text: framed, turns back... loneliness on his face.
scene_heading: INT. DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - PARLOR - NIGHT 14
text: Elena stands at the open window, watching her husband’s
text: silhouette on the distant hill... after a beat, horse and
text: rider GALLOP OFF. Sadly, Elena closes the window...
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - TELEGRAPH HILL — DAY 15
text: A town on the brink of change: the gold rush is on, the days
text: of the Old West are giving way to cobblestone streets and
dialog: telegraph wire.
text: In the crowd, we find ELENA AND JOAQUIN as she walks him to
text: achool. He’s looking moody, glum. She’s still carrying last
text: night’s fight and its lack of resolution, but tries to hide
text: it. As they pass a hotel, she offers...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I spy, with my little eye,
dialog: something beginning with...‘H’.
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: Why wasn‘t Papi at breakfast?
dialog: 15.
text: A child’s intuition; he stares accusingly. She covers --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I told you, he left early on
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: He’s always away on business.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (beat, sadly)
dialog: «++ I know,
dialog: (forcing a smile)
dialog: But he always comes back.
text: By now, they've arrived at school and the bell is RINGING --
text: he turns, heading up the steps with the other kids. Elena’s
text: suddenly filled with longing...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Joaquin...
dialog: (with love and worry)
dialog: Behave yourself, Mi Amor.
text: We see him struggle to find his words, then finally...
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: Hotel. Starts with the letter ‘H.’
text: And he disappears into the school. Elena walks on, feeling
dialog: an uncertain future...
text: Then she catches a reflection in a store window: TWO MEN ARE
text: FOLLOWING HER. We RECOGNIZE THEM as the dark-suited
text: strangers from the opening. Elena doeen’t turn. Keeps
text: walking, heart pounding. Veers into an alley. The men do
text: too... but Elena’s gone. They stop, confused.
text: Suddenly: she swings from an alcove behind them -- HER FIST
text: FLIES INTO THE FIRST MAN’S FACE, he tumbles back as she SNAPS
text: OFF A FLAGPOLE bearing the California state flag, uses it to
dialog: defend herself against the second man...
text: The fast-paced fight continues as we BOOM UP AND OVER THEM,
text: for a moment giving us a dramatic point of view on Elena and
text: her fighting skilla. Finally she sends him plummeting
text: backward, SPINS to finish off the first man but finds herself
text: staring INTO THE BARREL OF HIS PISTOL --
speaker_heading: FIRST MAN
dialog: Normally one signals surrender by
dialog: waving the flag. In your case,
dialog: dropping it‘ll do.
dialog: 16
dialog: 16.
text: She does. The man lowers his gun. We’1ll call him HARRIGAN.
text: He’s heavier than his slimmer partner, PIKE -- they’re
text: otherwise identical.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: -.. Who are you?
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: The relevant question, Sefiora De La
dialog: Vega, is who are YOU?
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: You have a unique family history --
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: Take your step-father, for example,
dialog: Don Raphael Montero -- a seditious
dialog: aristocrat who nearly destroyed

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: You don’t know Elena...
speaker_heading: DON DIAZ
dialog: You must show her who wears the

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: A fine idea, if I want my manhood
text: chopped off with a machete.
speaker_heading: DON ROBAU
dialog: Think of this as a vacation from
dialog: the shackles of matrimony...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Isn't it possible our wives married

dialog: with us?
dialog: The Dons all LAUGH --
speaker_heading: BON VERDUGO
dialog: My wife hates me.
speaker_heading: DON ROBAU

speaker_heading: DON DIAZ

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: So let me understand this... if I

dialog: can look forward to spending my

speaker_heading: DON VERDUGO
dialog: Where are you going?

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO

text: He goes. Alejandro opens the envelope. Pulls out a piece of
text: paper. As he reads, his jaw drops in total disbelief.
text: Confused, furious, he marches off, HURLING the paper away...
text: It lands in the water. The Dons lean in, then share a grave
text: eo look. We PUSH IN on the letterhead: “ISSUANCE OF PROCEEDINGS —
text: FOR DIVORCE” And as the ink begins to BLUR...
text: CUT TO BLACK. In the darkness, these words appear:

text: He hops out of bed. He’s stark naked. Lupe glances away

text: tall candlestick. Which doesn’t help.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Eh... what happened to my clothes?
speaker_heading: LUPE

speaker_heading: CORTEZ
dialog: Uh, Sefior, that knife is only two
dialog: dollars.
text: As the man turns, we see he’s sharpening a pair of WOODEN

dialog: Think about my offer now. Think

text: Then, Sensing something, his look tracks up to the veranda:
text: ELENA has been watching him, her eyes filled with longing.

scene_heading: EXT. THE VINEYARD/ HACIENDA - NIGHT 22
text: A sprawling hacienda ringed by an extraordinary vineyard. In

speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: See? A little spit, a little

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO

speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Listen, this party’s the only
dialog: reason I’m not at confession

speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE

dialog: Ahh... effervescent, yet tenacious.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: (rolling his eyes)
dialog: Who owns this vineyard anyway?
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: I’m told he‘s a count, recently in

dialog: I just met a most charming fellow.
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: And who might that be?

scene_heading: COUNT ARMAND COMPTE DE LA FERE: dashing, cordial -- ina

speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Welcome Friends, Californians,
dialog: Americans... you may be guests in
dialog: my home tonight, but I am your
dialog: guest in this great country. For
dialog: five hundred years, Europe has been
dialog: the cultural and economic center of
dialog: the world, but with the admittance
dialog: of California into the union,
dialog: America stands to become the next
dialog: great superpower. This vineyard
dialog: represents my hope that our two

dialog: future together: vines from my
dialog: homeland in France, taking root in
dialog: your fertile soil -- a state
dialog: blessed with limitless beauty...
dialog: but none more stunning than my
dialog: escort for the evening: Sefiora
dialog: Elena De La Vega.
text: And Alejandro's blood drains from his body as... in slow
text: motion, ELENA ascends the stage to meet Armand. He gently
text: KISSES HER. A FIREWORKS DISPLAY behind them IGNITES,
text: becoming a red, white, and blue SPARKLING AMERICAN FLAG.
text: Alejandro looks like a man who's just been given a death

speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Well, I’m pooped. Time to go.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Alejandro!
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: (seething smile)
dialog: Elena...
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: (a touch of concern)

speaker_heading: ELENA
speaker_heading: (REALLY confused)
dialog: You know each other?!
speaker_heading: ARMAND
text: We shared a giggle at the buffet
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: It seems that’s not all we've
dialog: shared.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Allow me to diffuse an awkward
dialog: situation -- Elena’s portrayed you
dialog: as a man of impeccable character.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: I‘m honored to be mentioned at all.
dialog: Why, I nearly forgot we were still

dialog: 30.

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: (yanks away)
dialog: Don’t be rude, Felipe, I’m just

dialog: met.
text: Just then, GOVERNOR RILEY -~ we remember him from the opening
text: -- approaches with a SOUTHERN COLONEL. During what follows,

speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Ah, Governor Riley, you honor me
dialog: with your presence.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR RILEY
dialog: Thanks to you, Count, this vineyard
dialog: may become a growth industry for
dialog: California.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: (nods, then)
dialog: Se May I introduce Colonel R.S.
dialog: Beauregard, of the First Alabama
dialog: Infantry.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: And what brings you to California,
dialog: Colonel?
speaker_heading: COLONEL BEAUREGARD
dialog: Diplomacy, My Dear -- rumblings of
dialog: secession could lead to war between
dialog: the North and South. The governor
dialog: was just assuring me California’s
dialog: committed to avoiding such a

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Forgive me, Colonel, I may not be a
dialog: learned politician, but perhaps one
dialog: way to avoid war would be to, oh I
dialog: dunno... free the slaves?
text: The colonel GLARES at Alejandro. Elena quickly tries to
dialog: change the subject -~
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Darling, you know how boring I find
dialog: politics...
dialog: Alejandro blanches -- not _ in esti i itics?
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: I believe Don Alejandro has a
dialog: point, Cherie. However, I salute
dialog: your effort to avoid war, Colonel.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR RILEY
dialog: (to Beauregard)
dialog: As do I. In fact, you're invited
dialog: to be my guest at our flag-raising
dialog: ceremony next week, 60 you can see
dialog: firsthand the peaceable spirit of
dialog: our citizens.
text: The colonel nods his thanks as MUSIC BEGINS and couples start

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Shall we, Darling?
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Excuse us, Gentlemen.
text: And they’re off. Alejandro watches them go, slugging more
dialog: wine, reeling...
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Perhaps you shouldn’t drink so much
text: on an empty stomach.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Perhaps you should wear lipstick if
dialog: you want to act like my mother.
text: So saying, he grabs Felipe and drags him from frame -~
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Alejandro, wai--
text: ON THE DANCE FLOOR: all the partners face each other in
text: parallel lines. Elena swings into Armand’s arms, wearing her
dialog: best smile. It isn’t easy. He sees that --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Say the word and I’11 escort you
dialog: home.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: And leave your guests?
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: In a heartbeat. I care for you too
dialog: much to subject you to an evening
text: of forced smiles, Elena.
text: She smiles appreciatively. They spin, Elena shifting to her
text: next partner in line -- IT’S ALEJANDRO. He pulls her close:
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Won’t your boyfriend be jealous?
text: Armand’s swept into the arms of a BOUFFANTED WOMAN who
text: presses him toward her enormous cleavage. He strains to keep
dialog: on eye on Elena during:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I didn’t want you to find out like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Ah, so that’s why you refused to
dialog: see me these last few months, you
dialog: were sparing my feelings --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: You're drunk --
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: You're the one not acting like
dialog: yourself. Since when do politics
dialog: bore you?
text: Like musical chairs, they shift partners again: Elena returns
dialog: to Armand --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: If you wish, I‘11 have him escorted
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I can handle hin.
text: Alejandro and Felipe dance side-by-side, facing their
dialog: reapective partners --
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: For the love of God, let’s get out
dialog: of this place --
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: I can handle her.
text: The line shifts again, Elena returning to Alejandro -~
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: You must tell me how you met.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Years ago, in Spain. We went to
dialog: finishing school together,
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: How nice you were reunited, so he
dialog: could... finish.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Don’t force me to embarrass you.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Sorry, too late.
text: Again they switch; this time, Alejandro and Armand end up
dialog: side-by-side --
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Tell me, Count, where does your
dialog: title rank among noblemen? Is it
dialog: higher than, say, a duke?
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: It's rather common, actually --
dialog: much like a Don.
text: Shift again: Armand returns to Bouffant Lady; Alejandro to
dialog: Elena --
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: He’s a delight. Rich, good
dialog: looking, and royalty.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Is there anything I can say that
dialog: would make you leave?
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: You could fall to your knees and
dialog: beg me to take you back.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I wouldn’t want to ruin my dress.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: It’s just as well, I’m enjoying
dialog: single life.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Is that supposed to make me
dialog: jealous?
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Does it?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (jealously)
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I_don't spend my nights out.
dialog: (composing herself)
dialog: And I haven‘’t told Joaquin. Now I
dialog: think you should go.
text: She starts to break away, but he spins her back to him ~-
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO ELENA
dialog: I finally understand why you
dialog: left me, Elena -- -- let go --
dialog: -- you finally found a man
dialog: who's happy to stay at home
dialog: ordering servants around -- ~-- Now I KNOW you’re drunk --
dialog: ~- your step-father would’ve
dialog: been so proud to see you take -- Keep your voice down --
dialog: your rightful place: on the
dialog: arm of royalty. Well
dialog: congratulations, your
dialog: highness--
text: AND ELENA SLAPS HIM HARD. The entire party has gone SILENT.
text: Everyone’s staring. Finally, Elena says, voice full of hurt:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: If you don‘t know me better than
dialog: that... then you never knew me at
dialog: all.
text: Now he looks ashamed. And regretful from his heart. Armand,
text: mercifully, signals to the orchestra and MUSIC begins playing
text: again. Alejandro bows to him in deference:
dialog: 23
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Thank you for your hospitality,
dialog: Count.
text: His eyes fall to Elena, all he wants is to take back what he
text: said. But he goes. A beat, then Elena turns to Armand...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I should explain --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: (delicately)
dialog: Please don’t. If I lost you, I
dialog: wouldn't be able to control myself
dialog: either.
text: Elena smiles her appreciation but fights to maintain
text: composure -- burdened, perhaps, by more than she can let on.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY ~ NIGHT 23
text: ALEJANDRO'S FACE, drunk, eyes closed. At first we think he’s
text: lying on cobblestones, but as we TILT AROUND we reveal he’s
text: SITTING UPRIGHT on Tornado, they’re BOTH leaning against an
dialog: alley wall, and what’s more -- they’re BOTH DRUNK. Alejandro
text: drops a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA, it clinks to the ground, Tornado
text: licking booze as it flows onto the cobblestone --
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: «+. Hey, haven’t you had enough?
dialog: (drunken wobble)
dialog: Tell me something, horse to man...
dialog: have you ever felt the cold stab of
dialog: love's betrayal?
text: Tornado BURPS. Alejandro RECOILS in disguet, loses his
text: balance and TUMBLES from the saddle. Tornado TAKES OFF,
text: disappearing around a corner...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Hey! AREN’T YOU FORGETTING
text: SOMETHING?! BSTUPIDO!
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: There you are...
text: The voice startles Alejandro. Fray Felipe has appeared above
text: him. Sighing, he helps Alejandro to his feet...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Next time you want to lift my
dialog: spirits, just shoot me in my sleep!
dialog: 36.
text: And now they’re walking along -- well, Alejandro’sa stumbling:
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: I didn’t know she’d be there,
dialog: Alejandro.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: How could she choose a man like
dialog: that?! ‘Count’ Armand, with his
dialog: fancy wine and that froufrou
dialog: accent!
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: I’ll admit, Elena didn’t seem to be
dialog: quite herself tonight... but she’s
dialog: your ex-wife now -- EX, from the
dialog: Latin root ‘Exeunt,’ meaning exit,
dialog: meaning goodbye. And if Armand is
dialog: a decent man, be happy for her.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: If he’s a decent man -~ if, from
dialog: the Latin root 'Iffy,’ meaning
dialog: questionable!
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: You're in no shape to discuss this,
dialog: Alejandro --
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: I‘1l make her want me back so badly
dialog: she'll be weeping with desire!
dialog: Nobody leaves my tequila worm
dialog: dangling in the wind!
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: If you wish to go on embarrassing
dialog: yourself, I want no part of it.
text: And he goes. Alejandro stumbles after him --
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: I'll have you know I’m perfectly
dialog: capable of embarrassing myself...
dialog: myself! Hear my vow, Padre:
dialog: Alejandro De La Vega always lands
dialog: on his fee--

text: A CLOCK strikes midnight above the deserted square. Far

text: She knocks: a SHOP MERCHANT appears, eyes boring into her...
speaker_heading: MERCHANT
dialog: We're closed.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I was hoping to buy a gift for my

text: His expression changes, and he opens the door for her to
dialog: enter...
scene_heading: INT. CURIO SHOP - NIGHT 25
text: The merchant lifts a curtain to reveal a BACK ROOM, wherein
text: we find the TWO MEN Elena fought in the alley: HARRIGAN and
text: PIKE are seated at a table playing Mahjong.
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: I'd offer you my chair, but I
dialog: assume you'd find it patronizing.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: How was the party?
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: Tell us about The Count --
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: Who was he talking to?
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: He spent most of the night talking
dialog: to the Senator, and a Southern
dialog: Colonel... I think his name was
dialog: Beauregard.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: (a severe glance to
dialog: Harrigan)
dialog: Troubling...
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: You have a new assignment: we
dialog: believe Armand keeps a telegraph
text: receiver somewhere in his hacienda.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: You do know what a telegraph
dialog: receiver is?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: How could I? I’m just a woman.
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: (cocky smile)
dialog: I... love... your spirit.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: The Count’s been receiving messages
dialog: from overseas -- we need to know
dialog: what they say.
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: You’11 steal the carbon ribbon,
dialog: deliver it to us.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: And if I refuse?
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: Then we'll have to remind you...
dialog: you have no choice.
text: With unnerving calm, Harrigan reaches into his pocket and
text: pulls out... THE MASK OF ZORRO! The one Alejandro lost in
text: the viaduct opening. The cruel threat lands on Elena --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I’1l send you both to hell for
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: +++ But of course.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: Until then we’1l be waiting for
dialog: that ribbon. Good evening, Sefiora.
text: They go back to their game, ignoring her. Elena, livid,

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY ~ NEXT DAY 26
text: Alejandro is snoring. A TONGUE begins licking his cheek.
text: Stirring, he smiles and mumbles...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Oh, Elena... you feel so soft...
text: His eyes open:
text: ALEJANDRO’S POV, FISH-EYE LENS - A_PIG is staring down at us,
text: its tongue flicking the lens. Alejandro BOLTS upright --
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Bad pig! Shoo!
text: He looks down realizing he passed out in the gutter, wearing
text: the same clothes from last night. At that very moment, two
text: PEOPLE ride past on horseback. Alejandro catches a glimpse
dialog: of the riders:
text: ELENA AND ARMAND. They stop in the marketplace ahead.
text: Determined, dusting himself off, Alejandro follows...
scene_heading: EXT. THE MARKETPLACE ~ CONTINUOUS 27
text: Armand extends a hand to help Elena dismount --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Thank you, Darling.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: A perfect day for a stroll in the
dialog: market.
text: As she takes hia hand, she notices a RING on his finger. The
text: design is odd: A SNAKE COILED AROUND THE GLOBE.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: What an unusual ring, I hadn't
dialog: noticed it before...
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: (a touch evasive)
dialog: My family’s coat of arms.
text: Something in his voice she can’t quite place. Strolling on,
text: they pass a HOMELESS PEASANT WOMAN under an archway, her hat
text: in front of her. Concerned, Elena drops several coins in...
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS PEASANT WOMAN
dialog: God bless you, Sefiora.
text: Elena offers a smile, and as they walk on --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: It seems your kindness hasn‘t
dialog: wavered since our days in Spain.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Neither has your talent for
dialog: flattery, but I’m not a schoolgirl
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Are you saying I’1l have to try
dialog: harder to impress you?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: You can start with dinner tonight.
dialog: Say, eight o’clock at your chateau?
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Why not your hacienda? I’m anxious
dialog: to meet your son.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (beat: how to play thie?)
dialog: ++. Please try and understand,
dialog: Darling. He isn’t ready yet for
dialog: another man in my life.
text: As if on cue, ALEJANDRO’S HEAD POPS UP FROM A CART OF MELONS
text: BEHIND ARMAND. Elena gasps in surprise --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: What is it?
text: He turns. Alejandro’s head disappears. To distract Armand,
text: Elena grabs the first thing she can from a nearby stand: a
text: flowery eyesore that barely passes for a HAT --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Uh, this... hat. Is breathtaking.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Shall I... purchase it for you?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: On second thought, who needs
dialog: another hat? But I could use...
dialog: 41.
text: Desperately looking around, she sees a TOBACCONIST CART
text: across the marketplace and a CUSTOMER there lighting a PIPE --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: +e. a pipe!
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: A pipe?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: A pipe! Yes, like my father used
dialog: to smoke. Tell me I haven‘t
dialog: repulsed you with my un~ladylike
dialog: habit.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: On the contrary, you fascinate me.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Leok, there’s a vendor --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: I thought I might pick up an item
dialog: er two anyway. Wait here, won’t
dialog: you?
text: He kisses her hand, then goes. Alejandro reappears:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: a a e?!
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Since when did you start smoking a
dialog: pipe?!
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I DON’T SMOKE A PIPE! I said that
dialog: to get rid of him so I can get rid
dialog: of you!
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Forgive me, it’s just such a treat
dialog: to see you out among the peasants,
dialog: I couldn’t resist the chance to
dialog: stop and say hello!
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Please tell me that smell isn’t
dialog: coming from you...
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Well, it is! That’s what you've
dialog: reduced me to -- I woke up this
dialog: morning with a pig, are you happy?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Nonono, I don't want hear about
dialog: your flings --
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: That’s not what I mean, it was a
dialog: farm animal!
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: ~- oh Dear God ~~
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: It’s not what you think, Elena,
dialog: we're just friends!
speaker_heading: ARMAND (0.S.)
dialog: ee. Elena?
text: She SPINS. Alejandro disappears. Armand re-approaches:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Yes, Darling?
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: What color?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: What color what?
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: What color pipe?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (uh...)
dialog: ee+ Pink?
speaker_heading: ARMAND
text: A pink pipe. Perfect.
text: He goes. She whirls. Alejandro reappears --
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: He’s so considerate...
speaker_heading: ELENA
text: Joaquin's about to get out of
dialog: school -- it’s your turn to pick
dialog: him up! Now gol
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: First tell me what you‘re doing
dialog: with this guy, Elena. This isn’t
dialog: like you --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: How the hell would you know?! We
dialog: were apart so often, maybe I
dialog: changed!
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: You didn’t --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: What makes you so sure?
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: After ten years of marriage, you
dialog: think I can't tell when you’re
dialog: hiding something?
text: Elena’s frustrated: he won't quit. So, winding herself up...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Alright. The truth? I fell out of
dialog: love with you a long time ago.
dialog: (she’s dying inside)
dialog: We were never meant to be together,
dialog: Alejandro, I’m with Armand now.
dialog: Do you hear me? Stay out of my
dialog: life.
dialog: This is the most brutal rejection Alejandro could imagine.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (finally, a whisper)
dialog: «++ Goodbye.
text: Alejandro, heartbroken, watches her disappear into the crowd.
text: WE FOLLOW ELENA as she ducks into an archway for privacy,
text: tears now welling in her eyes. The weight of her lie is like
text: a vice squeezing her heart. After a beat, a WOMAN’S VOICE:
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE
dialog: Are you alright, My Child?
text: Elena turns: it’s the peasant woman she gave money to...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I‘ll be fine, thank you.
text: The woman touches Elena’s cheek, and with the kindest smile:
dialog: 28
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: PEASANT WOMAN
dialog: Don't be sad. God is watching over
dialog: you.
text: The woman goes. Off Elena, buoyed by a flash of hope...
scene_heading: EXT. MARKETPLACE - CONTINUOUS 28
text: Alejandro heads out, at his lowest point. He BUMPS shoulders
dialog: with someone coming in:
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Permisso ~-—
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (head low, grumbling)
dialog: latch it.
text: As the man leaves, Alejandro realizes: IT’S JACOB McGIVENS!
text: Alejandro’s eyes narrow. Suspicious, he follows...
text: AT THE TOBACCONIST CART WITH ARMAND: the vendor finishes
text: wrapping a PINK PIPE. Armand looks up, only to meet the eyes
text: of McGivens a few feet away. McGivens gestures and moves
text: off. Collecting the pipe, Armand follows him into...
scene_heading: EXT. MARKETPLACE - ALLEYWAY ~ CONTINUOUS 29
text: Armand rounds a corner to find McGivens leaning against a
text: wall, using a blade to SHARPEN HIS TEETH.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: I received your note. I presume
dialog: you have what I want?
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Well now that depends on you...
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Make your meaning plain, Mr.
dialog: McGivens. While you may feel at
dialog: home here among the sewer rats, I
dialog: do not.
text: McGivens pops in his teeth, approaches, a touch of menace...
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: The Lord upholds the righteous, but
dialog: His coffers are dry. I believe
dialog: additional funds are imperative.

dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: I have yet to see the final deed I
dialog: require to complete our agreement.
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Cortez won't sell.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: I need that land to connect the
dialog: track to the main line, Mr.
dialog: McGivens -~ you assured me your
dialog: tenure with the railroad gave you
dialog: experience in such matters.
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Case you ain’t noticed, populating
dialog: Heaven's become a Federal crime.
dialog: Risk goes up? So’s the price.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Bring the deed to my chateau
dialog: tonight, and you’1l be compensated
dialog: for your added risk. Now go.
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: (tips his hat, a grin)
dialog: Oh, and uh... ‘fore you swing into
dialog: that fancy saddle of yours, might
dialog: wanna clean off your boots.
text: As he goes, Armand looks down to realize he’s stepped in
text: HORSE SHIT. Cursing, he snaps out a hankie and moves off -~
text: doesn’t see A SHADOWED FIGURE under an archway... ALEJANDRO.
text: He steps into the light, eyes burning --
scene_heading: INT. MISSION SANTA LUCIA - DAY 30
text: The doors BURST open as Alejandro enters urgently -- Felipe,
text: at the altar, spins around:
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: It‘s time for confession.
text: Felipe smiles. Leads Alejandro to the confessionals. The

text: Alejandro, leaving no trace of ita existence.
scene_heading: INT. SECRET CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 32
text: From a niche in the cobblestone wall, Alejandro opens a

scene_heading: EXT. THE CORTEZ RANCHO - DAY 35
text: On the back porch of a small clapboard dwelling, Blanca
text: Cortez washes clothes. She glances across the property to a
text: BARN, sees her husband hard at work inside.
text: IN THE BARN: like a blacksmith’'s forge, where Cortez builds
text: his miners‘ tools to sell at the market. He hammers away,
text: red hot metal glowing against a hearth. Pausing to wipe his
text: brow, he catches his wife’s smile through the barn doors.
dialog: 47.
text: Blanca finishes wringing out clothes, moves through the house
text: to pin them to the clothesline out front, but when she opens
dialog: the door... E VE! I WI IBLE
text: GRIN! As he cups her mouth, we go back to:
text: Cortez, in the forge -- when a voice stops him cold:
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS (0.S.)
speaker_heading: CORTEZ !!
text: Cortez races from the barn to find McGivens clutching Blanca,
text: a BOWIE KNIFE to her throat, his posse surrounding them --

dialog: ‘And the Lord shall expel them
dialog: before you, and ye shall possess
dialog: their land...’
speaker_heading: CORTEZ
dialog: Please... don’t hurt her...
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Gimme the deed!
text: McGivens snaps for the deed, eyes gleaming cruelly. Cortez
text: RUNS into the house -- hurls open a chest at the foot,
text: rummages desperately -- where's the deed?! -- finally he
text: finds it, races back outside...
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Bring it here.
speaker_heading: CORTEZ
dialog: Let her go...
text: McGivens HURLS Blanca to the dirt. As Cortez picks her up,
text: McGivens and his posse take aim at the helpless couple --
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: (re: his pistols)
dialog: ‘Salvation’... and ‘Damnation’...
dialog: got one thing in common, You gotta

speaker_heading: ZORRO (V.0.)

speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: Drop your guns. All of you.
dialog: @.,

dialog: 48.
text: In angry surprise, McGivens nods to his men and they
text: reluctantly throw their guns to the dirt.
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: (to Cortez and Blanca)
dialog: Get in the house.
text: They race off. Zorro pushes McGivens forward by the sword
text: tip, SNIFFING the air, he winces:
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: Cleanliness is next to Godliness --
text: And he knocks McGivens into a WATER TROUGH. Zorro LEAPS over
text: an adobe wall, McGivens SPLASHING and HOWLING at his men to
text: follow -- three of them snatch up their guns and hop over the
text: wall, landing in an ENCLOSURE filled with PIGS AND CHICKENS.
text: The animals scatter, mud flying, Zorro zig-zagging to create
text: a harder target as the men FIRE but they’re quickly OUT OF
text: BULLETS -- Zorro draws his sword and ATTACKS as:
text: McGivens leads three men to the porch of the Cortez house,
text: neds to one to kick the door down. Just before the guy does,
text: a SHOTGUN BLAST rips through it, HURTLING him off the porch.
text: McGivens and his remaining men duck for cover behind the
text: trough, FIRING BACK RUTHLESSLY at the house which...

scene_heading: INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS 40
text: Blanca races into the barn. As she locks the door shut,
text: KABOOM: it explodes as a bullet rips through the lock...
text: The men RACE IN to find: no Blanca. They separate, one

text: reara up: grabs a POKER from the hearth and RAMS THE RED HOT
text: TIP INTO THE MAN’S CHEST. He SCREAMS, CATCHING FIRE! The
text: hay ignites, within seconds the barn is engulfed in flames!
text: The other man CHARGES with a sword. Blanca climbs to the
text: HAYLOFT, but he grabs her leg and they both come CRASHING
text: BACK DOWN. The man raises his sword for the kill, when
text: ZORRO‘S WHIP coils around his arm and jerks the sword from
text: his grasp -- it goes HURTLING past Zorro into the cheat of
text: the CORNFIELD SWORDSMAN, who‘s followed Zorro into the barn.
text: And now Zorro takes on the HUGE opponent. They fight using

speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: Dad didn’t show.
text: He pushes past her, up the stairs, we hear his door SLAM.
text: Elena meets Felipe’s eyes, he tries to explain --
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Alejandro had--
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (interrupts, pissed)
dialog: -- business. Of course. Thank you
dialog: for bringing him home, Padre.
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Elena... you know I've never taken
dialog: sides between you and Alejandro. T
dialog: leve you both as my dearest
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (softening)
dialog: I know, Padre.
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: My confessional is always open. I
dialog: am bound by God to keep your
dialog: secrets... should there ever be
dialog: cause to unburden yourself.
dialog: And that teare her heart, because she'd like nothing more.
text: And for a minute, we think she just might... until, softly:
speaker_heading: ELENA

scene_heading: INT. MISSION SANTA LUCIA -— DAY 48
text: A caped figure drops to his knees before flickering votive
text: candles. ALEJANDRO gazes down, tortured with regret and
text: rage. Ags he begins to pray, a HAND appears on his shoulder:
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: What is it, My Son?
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: «-+ I'm asking God’s forgiveness.
dialog: For what I’m about to do.
text: Felipe now sees Alejandro's hands. They're covered with
text: Cortez’s blood. Felipe understands what it means.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: I’ve failed everyone I ever loved --
dialog: my wife, my son... and the people
dialog: I’ve aworn to protect.
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: You may have been blinded by
dialog: jealousy, Alejandro, but it didn’t
dialog: keep you from seeing the truth...
dialog: I believe Elena’s in danger.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: I won’t lose her twice, Felipe... I

scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - ELENA’S ROOM - DUSK 49
text: A burning candle, Felipe’s words of forgiveness ECHOING OVER
text: as Elena sits writing, her face wracked with conflicting
text: emotions. We read: "DINNER AT ARMAMD’S TONIGHT. WILL SEARCH
text: FOR TELETYPE RIBBON.” She rolls that into a SMALL SCROLL,

text: CLOSE on Joaquin’s SLING SHOT, its band pulled back --
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: Prepare to taste the vengeance of
dialog: Zorro, you filthy dog -~
text: And he SNAPS the sling shot, a BB knocking over a WATER
text: PITCHER. Just before it hits the floor, a HAND catches it:
text: ELENA, looking uneasy...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: «-. What’re you doing?
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: (hiding the slingshot
dialog: behind his back)
dialog: -». Nothing. Homework.
text: They look at each other. Both keeping their secrets. She
text: Places the pitcher back on the table, says gently...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I... have to go out, but only for a
dialog: little while.
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: You're always going out.
speaker_heading: ELENA

speaker_heading: JOAQUIN

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Because, I... promised a friend.
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: What friend?
text: He stares suspiciously. She forces a weak smile, and as she
text: begins to spin her lie, we realize who she’s talking about:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: A woman... I met her the other day.
dialog: She has... a daughter. Whom she
dialog: loves more than anything in the
dialog: world,
dialog: (eyes glistening)
dialog: But this woman’s been forced to
dialog: keep a secret, and it’s breaking
dialog: her heart... because a mother
dialog: should never have to lie to her
dialog: child.
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: «+. What’s her secret?
dialog: And she wants so desperately to tell him, but...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: She told me she would only speak of
dialog: it... when the time was right.
dialog: (leans in, kisses him)
dialog: Gabriella will make you dinner...
dialog: and be careful with your slingshot.
text: She goes. Joaquin stares, sensing his mother’s anguish but
text: unable to identify it -- which only confuses him more.
scene_heading: EXT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA - NIGHT 52
text: Elena‘s carriage rides through the front gate, passing TWO
text: DOBERMAN PINSCHERS chained to a tree. They watch her pass
text: with malevolent eyes. The carriage stops by the door, where
text: Elena sees Armand and Colonel Beauregard shaking hands. She
text: puts on a smile as Armand helps her from the carriage --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: You arrived just in time, Darling.
text: The Colonel was about to leave.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Not on my account, I hope.

dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: COLONEL BEAUREGARD
dialog: Nothing would please me more than
dialog: the pleasure of your company, My

text: Armand and Beauregard share a millisecond look -- it should

speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: {as Beauregard leaves)
dialog: How kind of you to extend such
dialog: hospitality to the Colonel.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: We share a common interest in the

dialog: You look so beautiful.
text: And he leads her inside...
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA ~ CORRIDOR - NIGHT 53
text: Elena and Armand pass under a Gothic archway. Up ahead,
text: Ferrog exits from an ORNATE DOOR -- Elena sees him slip a
text: TELEGRAM into his shirt. He LOCKS the door, approaches:
speaker_heading: FERROQ
dialog: Master, a word?
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: (to Elena)
dialog: Please excuse me a moment --
text: Armand and Ferrog walk off to confer. Elena pretends to
text: check her appearance in a mirror, but discreetly watches
text: them. Armand nods approval about something, then returns --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: My apologies, business never ends.
speaker_heading: ELENA
text: The carving on the archway is
dialog: beautiful... what’s through that
dialog: door?
dialog: 54
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
text: A private chapel. Piety is a long-
dialog: standing tradition in my family...
dialog: I'd show it to you, but dinner’s
dialog: waiting.
text: They move on, Elena glancing back at the door. Knowing the
dialog: telegraph must be on the other side...
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 54
text: Empty plates are cleared. Elena wipes her mouth with a
text: napkin, saying to Armand across the table:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: That was absolutely delicious.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Yes. And now --
text: {Two servants approach. One hands him a cigar. The other, a
text: gevere-looking woman named MARIE, offers Elena an oak box --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I'm sorry, Marie, I don’t smoke...
text: Armand pauses, confused, as Marie opens the box revealing the
text: PINK PIPE he bought at the market. Elena quickly covers:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: +». unless it’s my pipe. You
dialog: remembered, how thoughtful.
dialog: (slips it in her pocket)
dialog: Though I should let my stomach
dialog: settle first.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Just as well, I’ve been waiting all
dialog: night to tell you something.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Elena, when I first saw you at the
dialog: academy, the other boys said you
dialog: were the most beautiful woman on
dialog: the Iberian continent. They called
dialog: you ‘La Flor De Andalusia’... and I
dialog: thought, of everything in the world
dialog: I might ever know or have, it would
dialog: never be someone as stunning as
dialog: you... yet here you are.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Darling... there’s something I must
dialog: ask you.
dialog: oe:
dialog: 57.
text: Oh Dear God, he's going to propose. Elena flashes the
dialog: sweetest smile she’s got, which is pretty good --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Before you do, answer me one
dialog: question ~-
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: -- of course, whatever your heart
dialog: desires --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: -- Where's the bathroom?
dialog: He pauses: the bathroom?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: All your flattery’s making me
dialog: blush, I’d like to powder my
dialog: cheeks.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: «+. Of course. It‘s down the hall.
text: She gives him a smile and goes. Off Armand, a little thrown.
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 55
text: A door opens slightly and Elena peeks out. Coast clear, she
text: makes her way to THE CHAPEL DOOR. Removes a HAIRPIN. Her
text: beautiful hair falls. Using the pin, Elena begins to PICK
text: THE LOCK. Almost there -- then: A FLOORBOARD CREAKS. Elena
text: SPINS as FERROQ rounds the corner -- she plays relieved:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Oh, I'm so glad I ran into you, I’m
dialog: terribly lost. Would you show me
dialog: back to the dining room, please?
speaker_heading: FERROQ
dialog: (beat, suspicious)
dialog: This way.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Thank you so much. I can see how
dialog: indispensable you are to Armand.
speaker_heading: FERROQ
dialog: I am his devoted servant. And
dialog: would give my life to protect him
dialog: from any man -~ or woman... who
text: seeks to betray him.
dialog: 56
dialog: 57
dialog: 58.
dialog: And just when we think he has her number, she switches
text: tactics. Stops, leans in, so she barely has to murmur:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Perhaps it hasn‘t occurred to you I
dialog: may soon be the lady of this house.
dialog: So start exercising some respect
dialog: when you talk to me... or I‘11 have
dialog: your balls filleted with a side of
text: truffles.
text: A smile, and she goes, Ferroq watches after her, darkly,
text: then hears someone pulling up outside. He looks out the
text: window to see McGivens arriving on his horse....
scene_heading: EXT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA ~- FRONT COURTYARD ~ NIGHT 56
text: McGivens hops off his horse. Ferrog opens the front door and
text: ushers him in. As they go, we find...
text: ZORRO, in the distance on Tornado, hidden in shadow. He
text: dismounts and creeps onto the grounds. Hunched, he watches
text: through the PARLOR WINDOW where he sees Ferrog tell McGivens
text: to wait. Zorro gets an idea and creeps on --
text: And suddenly from darkness comes the sound of RUNNING PAWS --—
text: GHOST-LIKE MONSTERS LEAP INTO THE LIGHT: the two Dobermans,
text: their jawa barking death -- they abruptly SNAP BACKWARD, held
text: in place by their chains. Zorro exhales relief, creeping on
text: as the dogs lunge for him --
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: I’m sure you were cute as puppies --
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND‘S HACIENDA - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 57
text: Elena and Armand, where they left off -- all the while she’s
text: trying to figure out another way into the chapel...
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Feeling better?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Much, thank you.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: --.- You let your hair down.
dialog: Elena tenses: will it make him suspicious?
dialog: 58
dialog: 59
dialog: 60
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
text: It looks beautiful cascading over
dialog: your shoulders.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Elena, we've known each other for--
text: Suddenly, Ferrog ENTERS:
speaker_heading: FERROQ
dialog: -- Sir, you have a visitor.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: (exasperated, to Elena)
dialog: I apologize. Now it's your turn to
dialog: excuse me.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Of course.
text: Ferrog leads Armand out. The instant Elena’s alone she’s on
text: her feet -- moving to the rear doorway -- she pushes through:
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA - OUTSIDE THE CHAPEL ~ CONTINUOUS 58
text: Elena races back to the chapel door. Pulls the hairpin.
text: Fingers moving nimbly -- CLICK: the door opens. She enters.
text: We HOLD on the empty corridor... a beat later, we SEE ZORRO
text: appear out the window, climbing a rose trellis to the roof -~
scene_heading: EXT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA - ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 59
text: Zorro leaps off the trellis onto the rooftop. Sees the
text: CHIMNEY. Moves to it, fast -~ climbs in -- what's he doing?
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA ~- PRIVATE CHAPEL ~ CONTINUOUS 60
text: Darkness. Elena emerges into the light, and we PUSH CLOSE to
text: her face as she takes in the chapel, awestruck: it isn’t a
text: chapel at all. It’s FILLED with priceless works of art,
text: antiques. A wall is lined with EXOTIC WEAPONS from every
text: corner of the world. Elena’s eyes track to a TAPESTRY. It
text: bears the same marking we saw on Armand’s ring: A SERPENT
text: COILED AROUND THE GLOBE. Beneath it, the Latin words: “ORBIS
dialog: UNUM.”
text: And the music SWELLS as we PUSH IN on Elena, wondering what
dialog: the hell Armand’s involved in...
dialog: 61
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS 61
text: Zorro pops out of the chimney. Goes straight for Armand’s
text: desk, searching for some kind of clue. Opens drawers,
text: nothing -- checks the bookshelves, behind paintings, but
text: keeps coming up empty-handed. Then he notices...
text: A MIRROR on the wall, hanging slightly askew -- hi
text: outward like a door. Alejandro moves closer, touches the
text: mirror at its corner: it SWINGS OPEN, revealing...
text: A MAP OF AMERICA. Zorro'’s eyes play across it: Armand’s
dialog: traced the trajectory of America’s rail lines -- most
text: importantly, he’s outlined the path of a train track from
text: California's central line, right to hia vineyard.
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: He's building a track to the
dialog: vineyard...
text: Suddenly, the sound of the DOOR OPENING -- Armand enters with
text: McGivens -- but Zorro is gone.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: I presume you have the deed, since
dialog: you've deemed it necessary to
dialog: interrupt my dinner.
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: (pulling out the deed)
dialog: Right here, but we had a fly in the
dialog: ointment -- or should I say, a
dialog: fox... Zorro,
text: INTERCUT as we REVEAL Zorro, perched inside the chimney,
dialog: listening...
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: (dismissively)
dialog: I've heard the name among the
dialog: locals. He’s a peasant who
text: masquerades as a self-appointed
dialog: folk hero... men like that usually
text: find their way to the guillotine.
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: I ain't takin’ no chances. Me and
dialog: him, we got unfinished business.

dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Your vendetta can wait -- the track
dialog: must be completed on time.
dialog: (lights a match}
text: In two days... the future begins.
text: And Armand tosses the match into the fireplace. JZorro
text: glances down as the kindling beneath him begins to BURN --
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA ~- PRIVATE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS 62
text: Elena searches desperately for the telegraph receiver, but
dialog: can't seem to find it --
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS 63
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: +--+ What about our renegotiation?
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: There’s one more thing I need you
dialog: to do.
text: IN THE CHIMNEY: Zorro has shimmied up to the open air, smoke
text: THICKENING around him -- still, he can hear:
speaker_heading: ARMAND (0.S.)
dialog: I’ve been informed one of my
text: shipping vessels is arriving
dialog: tomorrow. To avoid the scrutiny of
dialog: a customs inspection, it’1l anchor
dialog: off Cauldron Cove. The cargo must
dialog: be brought here safely... I want no
dialog: mistakes, is that clear?
text: Zorro’s eyes NARROW hearing that. McGivens growls...
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Get this straight, you backwards-
dialog: ass frog: just cause I’m in your
dialog: employ don’t mean I abide ya. Soon
dialog: as our business is done, you beat
dialog: be on the first steamer back to
dialog: France. Savvy?
text: IN A LIGHTNING MOVE, ARMAND SLAMS McGIVENS’ FACE DOWN HARD ON
text: THE TABLE.
dialog: 64
dialog: 65
dialog: 67
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: If you ever threaten me again, Mr.
dialog: McGivens ~- Jake -- I‘11 carve my
dialog: family’s coat of arms into your
text: still-beating heart and feed it to
dialog: my dogs.
text: He releases McGivens who recoils, stunned by the force of
text: Armand's grip. Armand turns to Ferrog, utterly relaxed:
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Retrieve Mr. McGivens’ payment from
dialog: the chapel, would you, Ferrog?
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA - PRIVATE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS 64
text: Moving quickly, Elena spots a drape in the corner covering
text: something. She lifts the canvaa, revealing the TELEGRAPH
text: RECEIVER! She tries to pry it open, but it’s stuck --
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 65
text: Ferrog is climbing the staira to the chapel --
scene_heading: INT. ARMAND‘S HACIENDA — PRIVATE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS 66
text: The receiver finally GIVES. Elena removes the CARBON RIBBON.
text: We read: “SHIPMENT ARRIVING AT NOON. CAULDRON COVE.“ She
text: reaches into her bodice, pulls out a duplicate CARBON RIBBON,
text: replaces it. Quickly puts the telegraph under the drape --
scene_heading: INT. HACIENDA - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CHAPEL ~— CONTINUOUS 67
text: Elena exits, moving quickly. Reflected in a MIRROR ahead,
text: she SEES FERROQ approaching far down the adjacent hallway.
text: Startled, she DROPS THE TELEGRAPH RIBBON which UNSPOOLS
text: across the carpet. Frantically, she begins spooling it back
text: up -- comeoncomeon -- her eyes flick to the mirror where
text: FERROQ is nearly rounding the corner, there’s no way in hell
dialog: she’s gonna make it -~ but when he appears...
speaker_heading: ELENA‘ S GONE!
text: Curtains BILLOW at the OPEN WINDOW by the rose trellis.
text: Ferrog moves to close it. Stops. Sensing something. Stands

dialog: 69
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: EXT. LEDGE OUTSIDE STUDY WINDOW - CONTINUOUS 68
text: ELENA, perched on the rose trellis, literally a foot from
text: him. The carbon ribbon still in tangles in her hands.
text: Finally, Ferrog closes the window.
dialog: Elena exhales, finishes
text: spooling the ribbon back up, and climbs onto the ledge where
text: she inches along, searching for a way back inside...
scene_heading: EXT. ARMAND’S HACIENDA - ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 69
text: Zorro’s soot-covered face emerges from the chimney. He
text: lowers himself off the rooftop, onto the LEDGE...
text: WIDEN TO REVEAL: Alejandro and Elena are on opposite sides of
text: the Hacienda, moving toward each other on a COLLISION COURSE.
text: Up ahead is a BALCONY -- simultaneously, ELENA AND ALEJANDRO
speaker_heading: JUMP.

speaker_heading: ELENA
text: ALEJANDRO! FOR GOD’S SAKE,

speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: «+. There you are.
text: WHIP BACK to find her, ALONE, back turned to him. As he
text: approaches, she turna to reveal SHE'S SMOKING THE PINK PIPE:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Forgive me, Darling, I felt the
text: eudden urge to step out for a puff.
text: She inhales, her eyes BULGE and she starts HACKING --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Elena, are you alright --?
speaker_heading: ELENA

dialog: Fine --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Dear God, you're turning green --

speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: +++ Good. Because I have a little
dialog: something for you.
text: He removes a RECTANGULAR BOX from his coat and opens it,

text: what she’s distracting him from: AL iD. iS
text: IN THE RAFTERS. He’s going insane watching this --
text: Elena tosses the pipe over her shoulder, where it LANDS
text: beneath the balcony... INCHES FROM A WAITING TORNADO. When
text: she pulls away from Armand, THEY BOTH EXHALE the puff of
dialog: smoke she just took in --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: -.- Is that a yes?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: It’s a definite maybe.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: I know it’s sudden given what
dialog: you've just been through... but I
dialog: want to give you everything your ex-

text: Alejandro, only a few feet above, is peeling out of his skin.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: I don’t expect you to answer now.
dialog: Whatever you decide... the necklace
dialog: is yours.
text: He moves behind her and loops the necklace around her neck,
text: relishing the moment. She atruggles to remain composed, then
text: Elena pretends to ‘notice’ her watch:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Goodness, I lose track of time with
dialog: you... I should put Joaquin to bed.
text: Finally, she leads him back inside, her arm SHOOTING OUT
text: behind her signalling Alejandro to GO!
text: He drops down onto the balcony, enraged. Sees Tornado below
text: and LEAPS into the saddle. Only then does he realize TORNADO
text: HAS THE PIPE IN HIS MOUTH, its red embers burning.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: (snatching it away)
dialog: How many times have I told you?

text: class -- the kids stare, marvelling at this new Goliath of
text: the steam age -- and when it clears frame, we REVEAL:
text: JAKE McGIVENS AND HIS POSSE WAITING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Well... lookey here, Boys.
speaker_heading: FATHER QUINTERO
dialog: (sensing danger)
dialog: Please, Sefior. We want no trouble.

speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Call me McGivens, Jefe. Now maybe
dialog: you ain't heard, but your dingy

speaker_heading: RICARDO
dialog: Jeez, Joaquin, d’ya think--

scene_heading: EXT. CAULDRON COVE - CLIFFS - NOON 74
text: The wagon arrives at the top of a CLIFF, where two men are
text: waiting beside a WOODEN CRANE. McGivens dismounts, walking
text: to the cliff edge. He looks down to see:
scene_heading: McGIVENS’ POV - A SMALL BEACH BELOW, A SECRET COVE, where two
text: more men unload CRATES from a rowboat that’s been dragged
text: onto the sand. Off shore, we see a SHIPPING VESSEL anchored.
text: As McGivens and his men peer over the bluff, we DRIFT BACK to

text: vessel off-shore.
text: The crates are stacked on a PLATFORM suspended by a cable,
text: which begins to LIFT UPWARD... WE FOLLOW IT UP THE SIDE OF
text: THE BLUFF, finally reaching the top to find...
text: The two men, straining to operate the hand-cranked wooden
text: erane, the cable looped over a pulley at the top. Joaquin
text: carefully emerges from behind the rocks to get a closer look.
text: As he does, some LOOSE ROCKS tumble down to...
text: The men winding the crane’s hand-crank. They stop, noticing
text: the rocks. Joaquin DUCKS, slowly raises hie head -- to his
text: surprise, there’s now only ONE MAN operating the hand crank.
text: Sensing something, Joaquin WHIRLS to reveal THE OTHER MAN
text: BEHIND HIM! The man loops a KNIFE around Joaquin’s neck and

text: McGivens, and takes a bow. McGivens BARKS to two of his men:
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: GUARD THE CRATES!

text: posse. Joaquin, catching his breath, looks up GLEEFULLY:
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: OhmyGod you’re Z-~
text: Zorro cuts him off with a WHISTLE: Tornado gallops in from
dialog: the brush --
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: (to Tornado)
dialog: Take hi he hil , it £
dialog: me there!
text: Amazingly, Tornado KNEELS DOWN so Zorro can lift Joaquin into
text: the saddle, then GALLOPS OFF. Zorro LEAPS onto the cable,
text: SLIDES DOWN IT ERROL FLYNN STYLE, landing gracefully on the
text: beach behind the guards -- taps them on the shoulder, and as
text: they turn -- WHACK -- he knocks them both out cold.
text: Moving fast to a crate, he sees a BRAND emblazoned on the
text: lid: A SERPENT, COTLED AROUND THE GLOBE. The same design
text: Elena saw on Armand’s ring.
dialog: 76
dialog: 70.
text: Zorro's eyes move over the symbol, what is this? And what's
text: inside? He pries open the crate, his hand reaches in... and
text: finally, he pulls out...
text: A BOTTLE OF WINE? What the hell?
text: No time to think, he slips the bottle in his belt, then
text: notices something: McGivens has left his Henry Repeater
text: against the rock. And Zorro gets an idea...
text: AT THE TOP OF THE CLIFF, McGivens and his men arrive,
text: breathless. No Zorro. He looks down, sees his two guards
text: spread-eagled on the beach below -- and again, ZORRO WAVING
text: UP THEM! McGivens HURLS his hat to the ground and --
text: TIMECUT: McGivens and the men have climbed back down to the

text: CONCEALED ROPE, pulling the trigger on the Henry Repeater
text: which Zorro's set into position between two rocks -- the
text: blast SEVERS THE EMERGENCY CABLE holding the platform in
text: place and it comes CRASHING DOWN ON THE REST OF THE SHIPMENT!
text: McGivens and his men HURL themselves out of the way, but two
text: aren‘t so lucky and get CRUSHED. As McGivens pulls himself
text: up from the sand, he hears a WHINNY and looks up to see:
text: ZORRO, BACK ON THE CLIFF. He raises his hat, then
text: disappears. Off McGivens, eyes glaring death...
scene_heading: EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE BLUFFS - DAY 76

speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: (thrilled, stammering)
dialog: I can’t believe it’s you! You‘re
dialog: really Zorro! I mean... whoa! And
dialog: Tornado! Man, he’s huge!
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: (dressing the wound)
dialog: Hold still, Joaquin --

speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: You know my name? Zorro knows my

speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: I, uh... well, I know your father.
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: You... know my dad?
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: (beat, improvising)

dialog: Especially not your mother.
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: ee. Why?

dialog: attack if he saw what happened
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: No he wouldn‘t... he didn’t even
dialog: remember to pick me up at school
dialog: yesterday.
text: That freezes Alejandro. Even behind the mask, we see the
text: guilt in his eyes.
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: He didn’t forget, Joaquin... what
dialog: you have to understand is--
text: He pauses. His son is staring up at him, waiting so
text: desperately for an answer... and finally, with resignation:
dialog: 77
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: +++ you don’t have to understand
dialog: anything. He should’ve been there.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I know he feels terrible. For
dialog: all the moments in your life he’s
dialog: missed.
text: Joaquin senses deep emotion welling up in Zorro. Weird.
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN

speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
dialog: ++» Nothin’.
text: A flicker of disappointment in Zorro’s eyes, but he manages a
text: amile. A last look from Joaquin, and as he turns to go --
speaker_heading: ZORRO
dialog: Keep your chin up, eh?
dialog: That stops Joaquin cold: those are the same words his father
text: said to him in the carriage.
dialog: 78
dialog: 73.

speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: It’s a Lafite 1791, very rare --
text: Alejandro enters frame, pacing, a burning in his belly:
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: It doesn’t make sense. I thought
dialog: the shipment would explain
dialog: everything...
text: Felipe pours the wine into a silver ritual cup, raises it to
text: CHRIST ON THE CROSS hanging above the altar --
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Bless you for turning water into
dialog: wine -~
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: He’s building a track to connect

dialog: why?!
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Wait a minute... those are the same

dialog: It’s the same wine!
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: The one the count passed off as his
dialog: own vintage!
dialog: (staring at each other)
dialog: If he’s not making wine in the
dialog: vineyard... what’s he doing?
dialog: 79
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO

dialog: crusades.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Waiwait... Armand... is a knight?
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: According to legend, they began as

speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: It's said a handful of knights

scene_heading: INT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - AFTERNOON 80
text: Matinee: a DIVA belts out the aria in a bravura voice. ELENA
text: AND ARMAND are watching from a private box. He takes her
text: hand. She accepts, looking drawn, a million miles away. A
text: beat, then Ferrog enters, urgent. Whispers in Armand’s ear.
text: His face goes taut. Forcing a smile, he whispera to Elena:
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Forgive me, Darling, I won‘’t be a
dialog: moment.
text: He exits. Elena turns, alert, wondering what’s happening -~-
scene_heading: INT. OPERA HOUSE - THE BAR - CONTINUOUS 81
text: Armand and Ferrog enter the elaborate bar to find McGivens
text: waiting, with a shit-eating grin. He strikes a MATCH,
text: igniting a shot of WHISKEY:
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: I do enjoy an occasional dance with
dialog: the devil.
text: And without blowing out the flaming shot, he throws it back.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: This better be damned important.
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: You’re the one who’s damned, Sly
dialog: Boots. Zorro destroyed your
dialog: shipment.
text: McGivens pours another shot, strikes another match. Armand’s
text: hand lashes out, fingers extinguishing the match --
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: I increase your payment and this is
dialog: the news you bring me?!
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Open your eyes: Zorro got there
dialog: ahead of us, means one of your
text: people‘’s talking.
text: That registers, but Armand keeps his reaction contained.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: The Hacienda can’t front as a
dialog: vineyard if it isn’t producing
dialog: wine...
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Maybe you oughtta reconsider
text: puttin’ together a fox hunt.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: De it -- and when you find this
dialog: Zorro, take his head. Nothing can
text: stop the train from departing at
dialog: dawn... now get out.
text: Their eyes hold, then Mcgivens exits. Armand says to Ferroq:
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: If someone’s talking, find the man
dialog: responsible.
speaker_heading: FERROQ
dialog: Master... what if it’s a woman?
text: We go TIGHT ON ARMAND, anger mounting in his look...
dialog: V7.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: I'll forgive the inference, because

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Don’t turn around. Don‘t say
dialog: anything. Just listen.
text: Elena’s heart quickens. Though she’s in shadow, there are
text: people in the boxes around her. She can’t make a scene.
text: Alejandro leans closer, in her ear...
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: I‘ve been trying to convince you
dialog: Armand’s not the man he appears to
dialog: be... but you already know that.
dialog: eS You‘ve always been able to see
dialog: people for who they are... even me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Whatever he’s making in that

speaker_heading: ELENA

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: What are you involved in? Tell me--
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: You_havye to trust me--
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: (struggling)

text: Torn, his question unanswered, Alejandro pushes quickly
dialog: through the curtain and:
text: THE IMAGE CHANGES SUDDENLY: we’re watching Alejandro as he
text: leaves Elena in her box, as seen through OPERA GLASSES.
text: Across the opera house, HARRIGAN lowers the opera glasses.
text: He swivels to PIKE. Quickly, they rise and EXIT --
scene_heading: INT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - MEZZANINE - CONTINUOUS 83
text: Alejandro pushes through the crowd with a full head of steam,

speaker_heading: ARMAND

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Forgive me, I came to say goodbye

dialog: both happiness.
text: He GOERS, leaving Armand a little puzzled... still, dubious.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84
text: Alejandro bounds down the steps. A man is headed up toward
text: him, indistinctly part of the crowd ~-- it’s Harrigan.
text: We go to an EXTREME CLOSE UP of a RING on his finger, he
text: flicks open the GEM revealing a TINY NEEDLE. “Accidentally”
text: bumping into Alejandro, he injects the needle into his wrist,
text: a pierce so small Alejandro doesn’t notice:
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: -~ Excuse me -—-
text: And he’s gone. Alejandro hails a Hansom Carriage:

speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO

scene_heading: I/E. HANSOM CAB ~ MOVING - CONTINUOUS 85

scene_heading: EXT. DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - DUSK 86
text: Armand’s carriage arrives at the hacienda, Ferrog reining the
text: horses. Armand steps out, offering a hand to Elena...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I had a wonderful time. Thank you.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: I saw Alejandro leaving the opera
dialog: house, Elena. If I were a less
dialog: trusting man, I might think you
dialog: still have feelings for him.
dialog: ELENA’S FACE: drastic times call for drastic measures. So:
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I told him something I haven't told
dialog: you yet.
dialog: (a smile, though it kills
dialog: her)
dialog: I want to be your wife, Armand.
text: And despite his mistrust, the dilemma he’s been struggling
text: with seems to evaporate. Taking Elena in his arms, he KISSES
text: HER passionately. FERROQ watches through icy eyes.
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: You have my heart, without
dialog: expectations. It is and always
dialog: will be yours, Elena.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: After I put Joaquin to bed, perhaps
dialog: we could have supper at your
dialog: Hacienda. If I’m going to be the

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: A late supper, then... I could stay
dialog: the night.
text: He tries to contain his lust, just as she contains the fact

speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Elena... we’ll have the world, you
dialog: and I.
dialog: She smiles, t 2 r 2 1l_ out. As Armand

scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL ~— DUSK 87
text: The screen is BLURRY. We’re on the floor. Something’s

text: ZORRO. Dangling in Harrigan‘’s hand through CELL BARS.
text: Pike’s beside him. They stand on the other side of the cell:
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: The drug will wear off soon, Mr. De

speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: Or would you prefer... Zorro?
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: The day California was voted into

speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: (the mask: )
dialog: I believe this belongs to you?
text: Alejandro's mind is spinning --
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: +++ who are you?!
dialog: 81.
text: And shockingly, Pike pulls out... A BADGE!
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: I'm Agent Pike, this is Agent
dialog: Harrigan. We’re The Pinkertons:
dialog: operatives of the United States
dialog: government.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: You‘re the good guys?
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: You could say we’re a kind of...
dialog: Secret service.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: We’re living in perilous times, Mr.
dialog: De La Vega. America's gates have
text: swung wide open...
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: Trouble is, it’s getting harder to
dialog: tell a genuine American from the
text: man who’s just pretending to be.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: Which is why, on occasion, we
dialog: require certain individuals to aid
dialog: in our country’s defense... people
dialog: like your ex-wife.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Elena... works for you? As a apy?
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: We needed someone who could gain
dialog: his trust.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: And who more suited to the task
dialog: than the woman he could never
dialog: forget?
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: You see, before The Count’s arrival
dialog: here, we intercepted a telegram he
dialog: dispatched to his associates
dialog: throughout Europe.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: In that telegram, he claimed he was
text: on the verge of producing a new
dialog: weapon,
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: A weapon that would bring about...
dialog: mass destruction.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: With a single target in mind...
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN PIKE
dialog: The United States of America. The United States of America.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: (trying to add that up)
dialog: What kind of weapon would do that?
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: Your ex-wife may be on the verge of
dialog: answering that very question.
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: And every time you interfere, you
dialog: jeopardize her cover. Understand?
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: (anger rising)
dialog: The divorce was your idea, wasn’t
dialog: it? So Elena would be free to lure
dialog: in the count... ore hi O°
dialog: this...
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: We prefer to think of it as a
dialog: mutual understanding: in exchange
dialog: for her help, we promised to keep
dialog: the true name of Zorro secret from
dialog: his enemies.
speaker_heading: HARRIGAN
dialog: A name you share with your wife...
dialog: and son.

text: The HEAD JAILER is playing cards with a GUARD. A SECOND

scene_heading: AND DISAPPEAR.

text: Elena sneaks in the loading dock, watching as the cloaked men
text: are lead by a guard past SIX MASSIVE (but empty) WINE VATS
text: lined with MAINTENANCE LADDERS. The ladders connect over the
text: top of the vats, forming a criss-crossing network.
text: The men are brought to a wall of STACKED BARRELS -- the guard
text: touches one at its center and THE BARRELS SWING OPEN: a
text: secret door. The men pass through, the guard remaining
text: behind as the ‘door’ closes.
text: Elena scans for the other guards: there are two atationed by

text: She ducks into shadow...
text: The guard by the barrels hears a ‘past.’ Brow furrowed, he
text: Moves around the nearest vat... from the darkness, Elena
text: SMASHES HIM IN THE FACE with a wooden paddle. He tumbles

text: The NOISE alerts the other guards -- they fan out -- two of

dialog: bewildered --
text: ANGLE UP TO REVEAL ELENA on top of the vats, holding the

speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: -- drop it --

text: UP and SEE Elena racing along the ladders...
dialog: 92.
text: Climbing to BLOCK HER OFF at both ends, they attack: a_
text: furious swordfight on the ladders, Elena matching them blow-
text: for-blow -- they drive her toward the EDGE and she jumps,
text: SLIDING down a pipe to the floor. In so doing, she LOSES HER
text: SWORD. And the guards are THERE, moving in for the kill...
text: Until a WHISTLE snaps them around: Zorro. He winks, they

text: Elena‘s feet.
text: Alejandro moves to embrace her, but she reaches out to stop
dialog: him --
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: You asked if I believe we were

speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: This country has one glaring
dialog: weakness: its people are divided by

dialog: war is far more dire than anyone
dialog: truly knows. It is... inevitable,
dialog: Gentlemen. The only question is,
dialog: who will claim victory?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We will answer that by employing
dialog: the newest weapon of the modern
dialog: age, a compound thirteen times more
dialog: powerful than gunpowder:
text: He opens a SMALL BOX. On an inset of velvet is a VIAL filled
text: with CLEAR LIQUID. Armand holde it like an egg...
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: ..- Nitroglycerin. For months,

speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: With the help of our Confederate
dialog: ally, Colonel Beauregard, we’1ll
dialog: begin regular shipments to the

dialog: hell -- of remaining united.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The end result, Gentlemen, ia this:
dialog: the Central Banks of Austria and
dialog: Hungary will take possession of the

dialog: Leopold, you’ll regain control of

speaker_heading: LORD DILLINGHAM
dialog: And what do you gain from this,
dialog: Count?
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Why, the most valuable commodity of

speaker_heading: LORD DILLINGHAM
dialog: Brothers, you know my spirit is
dialog: with you, but we risk antagonizing

dialog: see myself out.
text: Dillingham heads off. Armand looks defeated... then HURLS

dialog: clears...
speaker_heading: ARMAND
dialog: Any further objections? ... Good,

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Stop calling him my boyfriend.
speaker_heading: ALEJANDRO
dialog: Then why are you still wearing his

speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Unless you‘ve come to confess, you

speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Funny you should mention

scene_heading: AGAINST McGIVENS’ HEAD -- Felipe SHOUTS to Joaquin:
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: RUN! !
text: Joaquin BOLTS for the door as Felipe SWINGS the candelabra at
text: two of the men, knocking them back -- he’s one hell of a

text: Felipe freezes, eyes wide, staring at the barrel of McGIVENS’
text: SMOKING GUN. His look tracks down, to a HOLE in his frock:
speaker_heading: FRAY FELIPE
dialog: Oh... God...
text: He falls to his knees. Joaquin SKIDS to a stop and SCREAMS:
speaker_heading: JOAQUIN
scene_heading: FELIPEYOUKILLEDFELIPE!
speaker_heading: MCGIVENS
dialog: Shut him up and put him in the
