speaker_heading: MR. BINKS

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Intern, not a secretary.
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: Intern? Like Monica Lewinsky? You

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: If you want to get into the music

speaker_heading: MR. BINKS

speaker_heading: DAPHNE

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I do, sir. Very much. Honestly,

speaker_heading: MR. BINKS

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I called you sir?
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I didn’t even notice.
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: Well, you did.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I'm... sorry?
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: I just wanted to tell you that I
dialog: think you two are making a terrible
dialog: mistake moving in together.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: You two are not ready at all.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Yeah we are.
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: No you aren’t.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I believe we are.
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: No you don’t.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I do. I do love her too.
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: You just don’t.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Yes, I do. We’re perfect for each
dialog: other. I mean, we’ve never even
dialog: had a fight. That’s how awesome we
dialog: are together. I know my feelings
dialog: and they are of love.
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: You don’t and they aren’t. You’re
dialog: not right for her. She’s a flighty
dialog: girl. She needs someone more

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: She's an amazing sculptor. It just
text: takes a while to break into the art
dialog: world.
dialog: (clearly repeated froma
dialog: speech Daphne has said)
dialog: You have to apprentice first and
dialog: even just to get the apprenticeship
dialog: can take years but art isn’t about
dialog: money, it’s about --
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: I’m not going to debate my
dialog: daughter’s future with you. She’s
text: a cute girl who needs to land a
text: rich husband before she pops out a
text: few grand kids and ends up teaching
text: art in an elementary school.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I think she’s talented.
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: The world has too much talent and
dialog: not enough customers. Here’s the
dialog: deal: quit playing house like a
dialog: little girl. You’re in the music
dialog: biz. Go out, party like a rock
dialog: star, experiment with drugs, go
dialog: apeshit crazy so you don’t end up
dialog: doing it later in life. Move in
text: with a couple best male friends and
dialog: live it up. Now’s the time.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I already live with my best friend.
dialog: Daphne's my best friend.
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: No, she isn’t.

text: Aaron and Daphne are cleaning up the meal.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: What if my dad’s right? What if I
dialog: have no talent?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: First of all, he said you had
dialog: talent. He just said there’s not
dialog: enough customers. Which there are,
dialog: by the way. Forget I mentioned it.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Maybe this is all just shit shit
dialog: shit and shit. I just want to
dialog: break it all and start over again.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Are you kidding? This is so super
dialog: pretty.
text: REVEAL they’re discussing a sculpture of a bloody, screaming
text: woman holding a bloody, screaming baby. It’s more terrifying
text: than pretty. She definitely has talent, a dark weird talent.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you use glaze?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Yeah. He’s right. My career’s
dialog: going nowhere. I suck.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Let’s make a game plan. Rent a
dialog: gallery downtown. Advertise the
dialog: show in LA Weekly. Maybe do some
dialog: guerrilla marketing stuff. We’ll
dialog: just get this done.
text: Aaron's relentless positivity is starting to grate.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: The point isn’t the show, Aaron.
dialog: It’s not that easy. Trying to do
dialog: something creative is just
dialog: different than what you do. It’s
dialog: not a linear process. No offense.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I’m sorry. I know I’m being
dialog: difficult and a bitch about all
dialog: this stuff.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: You're not being a bitch.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I was being a bitch. You can be
dialog: mad at me.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m not mad at you.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I love that you’re nice. You’re
dialog: the first nice guy I’ve ever dated
dialog: and I love that about you. But
dialog: when I’m being a bitch and you
dialog: don’t say I’m being a bitch you’re
dialog: keeping a part of yourself closed
dialog: off from me. Feel free to be
dialog: honest and tell me when you're
dialog: annoyed at me.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m being totally honest. That's
dialog: what I love about us. I can always
dialog: be honest. You couldn’t ever annoy
dialog: me. You’re too perfect.
text: Daphne smiles at this.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: And as for getting your career off
dialog: the ground, just make a list of
dialog: what needs doing. That’s how I get
dialog: stuff done.

dialog: What? Why’re you whispering,
dialog: buddy? You got a secret?
text: Aldous is shoving a balloon of heroin into Aaron’s hand. As
text: Aaron and Aldous have this exchange the line moves them
text: closer and closer to the scary looking British security
dialog: services. NOTE: This whole fight is done in angry whispers.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: (whispering intensely)
dialog: I said shove this up your bum now.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What is that...?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: (whispering intensely)
dialog: It’s heroin, what do you think it
dialog: is?
text: Aldous grabs Aaron’s pants and starts to try to shove the
text: heroin down his pants. Aaron tries to get away. The
text: Security looks over to see what the commotion is about.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering intensely)
dialog: Stop acting all mental and let me
dialog: shove this heroin up your ass
dialog: already. I thought you used to run
dialog: heroin all the time.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (whispering intensely
dialog: back)
dialog: I did, it’s just been like eight
dialog: years so I’m not exactly...
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: (whispering intensely)
dialog: Shove it up your ass or I throw a
dialog: bloody fit and we’re both sent to
dialog: Guantanamo to be assraped by bin
dialog: Laden.
text: They're almost at the head of the line... Aaron sees his life

text: down the back of his pants.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering intensely)
text: Not so hasty.
dialog: 38.
text: Aldous pulls a tube of KY Jelly out of his manpurse and

text: He removes his hand.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

dialog: On occasion.

scene_heading: HEATHROW SECURITY

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

scene_heading: HEATHROW SECURITY

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: You're welcome. Well all cleaned

dialog: (then)
dialog: This is my good friend, Aaron.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (nervously spewing)
dialog: What’s up? It must be crazy doing

scene_heading: HEATHROW SECURITY
dialog: I guess I have a few.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: I mean, are you like always
dialog: suspicious of every single person
dialog: you see?
scene_heading: HEATHROW SECURITY
dialog: Not really. Most people are good
dialog: blokes.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Cause I’d be all the time thinking
dialog: like that “guy over there has a
dialog: bomb” or “that women over there has
text: a bunch of drugs in her purse and a
dialog: bomb.” Cause I think that anyway

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: My quit date isn’t until next week.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Your quit date?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: A year before you quit you pick a

dialog: quit date my whole AA plan goes out
dialog: the window.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I thought when you quit you just
dialog: quit.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: If I don’t do heroin this week I’1l
dialog: jump the gun on my quit date, which
dialog: I picked over a year ago and have
dialog: been mentally preparing for ever

dialog: once and for all will be on your

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: CLUB WAITRESS

text: The Flight Attendant heads off.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Oh, cool, that’s really

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Drink it the fuck down.

scene_heading: CLUB ATTENDANT

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: That sucks. Why the change?
speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: DAPHNE

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: DAPHNE

dialog: So...
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: So I’m not going to do that right

dialog: need it.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: It was wrong of me to make you
dialog: stash it up your bum. That was not
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: At the very least you should have

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Get in there!
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m afraid! I heard that this

dialog: hit the flusher and it sucked out

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: What do you feel?
speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: JONATHAN SNOW
dialog: It’s been a long time since we’ve

dialog: Bangkok?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: How could I forget?
speaker_heading: JONATHAN SNOW
dialog: I just want to say it wasn’t

dialog: good parenting.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I was a bastard to you, I realize

speaker_heading: JONATHAN SNOW
dialog: How could you not be? I was never

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Mum wasn’t the easiest person to

speaker_heading: JONATHAN SNOW
dialog: Still no excuse. You were just a

speaker_heading: JONATHAN SNOW
dialog: It’s good to see you, boy. It

scene_heading: ANGLE BACK ON AARON:
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: We went to a magic show and now
dialog: we're at like a nightclub.
text: A group of naked strippers walk by Aaron, really close.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Like a cool nightclub. It’s called

dialog: “The Wet Pussy Lounge.”
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: -- The Lounge. Palms Casino. I

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I just miss you and I thought you’d
dialog: be home by now and I can’t get to
dialog: the bottom of this last piece, you
dialog: know? I just spattered fake blood
text: on the fake doll part of it but it
dialog: doesn’t feel right.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Well, I’m sure it looks beautiful.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: It does and that’s the problem.
dialog: (then)
dialog: This is so stupid, but I just want
dialog: to hear you breathe. Just hearing
dialog: you breathe calms me down.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Oh. OK.

speaker_heading: AARON

dialog: Oy, Aaron! We’re getting AIDS
dialog: rubbed all over our pants! No
dialog: offense, Katherine!
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Look, Roma wants to speak to you. *
dialog: He thinks we’re at the Four Seasons
dialog: and that you’re sick and that’s why
dialog: you don’t want to rehearse at the

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m here. I’m here. Sorry. Just
dialog: a weird connection. Battery’s on
text: its way out.
text: Aaron looks at Aldous who winks at him. Aaron looks over at
text: the stripper’s pole where a REALLY DRUNK STRIPPER is doing a
text: routine. She climbs up the pole and then tries to slide down
text: upside down. Instead she falls off the pole and lands hard
text: on her head. Aaron takes this opportunity to leave.
scene_heading: EXT. STRIP CLUB
text: Aaron walks outside with the phone. A second later a girl
text: (KRISSY, 20S) comes out. She’s petite, blonde and busty --
dialog: exactly Aaron’s ideal.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m sure your piece is much better
dialog: than you think it is.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: But if I think it’s bad then in my
dialog: reality it is simply bad and isn’t
dialog: that the only thing that counts?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I don’t know -- Uh, my battery’s

speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: You have a smoke?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: No, sorry. Don’t smoke.
speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: I shouldn’t. What’re you doing out
dialog: here if you don’t smoke?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Waiting for my friend and his
dialog: father to stop getting lapdances.
dialog: My friend’s father is dying
dialog: apparently and this is what they
dialog: want to do together I guess.
speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: You not into the lapdance thing?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: No offense, but no.
speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: I’m not into it either. I’m not a
dialog: stripper. But thanks.
dialog: (they laugh)
dialog: Can I have a sip of your drink?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Sure thing.
text: Aaron hands Krissy his drink. Aldous and Jonathan stumble
text: out of the strip club with their strippers.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: There you are, Aaron! We thought
dialog: we'd bring the party back to fake
dialog: Italy.
dialog: 79.
scene_heading: KATHERINE THE STRIPPER
dialog: You mind coming along, Krissy?
speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: Of course not.

scene_heading: INT. BELLAGIO SUITE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The four of them are bent over doing coke.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: You want any?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Nahhh, I’m good.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: It’s really just like having a cup
dialog: of coffee.
scene_heading: KATHERINE THE STRIPPER
dialog: Like a venti Frappucino that you
dialog: snort up your nose.
speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: Just a little won’t hurt a bittle.

speaker_heading: AARON

scene_heading: INT. BELLAGIO SUITE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Jonathan & Millenium and Aldous & Jet have sex in a giant

text: and Krissy just sitting on the balcony, trying not to watch.
scene_heading: INT. BELLAGIO SUITE - BALCONY - NIGHT
text: They are both pretty drunk and coked up.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: It’s just like my girlfriend and I
dialog: are like totally right for each
dialog: other but sometimes I wonder if we
dialog: are in fact right for each other
dialog: because even though we never fight
dialog: she can make things complicated
dialog: that don’t seem that complicated to
dialog: me and she always says that I’m her
dialog: first nice boyfriend, like I’m
dialog: missing testicles or something but
dialog: she’s also so great and completes
dialog: my life even if I am scared of
dialog: being honest with her about those
dialog: things I just told you. So, what
dialog: do you do for a living?
speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: I’m a student. Studying to be a
dialog: doctor.
dialog: 80.
text: Krissy puts her hand on his. Aaron stares at it.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I'll be right back.
text: Aaron goes inside into the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Aaron closes the door and looks in the mirror.
text: in, holding a large terrifying looking joint.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: That was something else. She's a
dialog: dirty, dirty bird. Want a hit?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I call it the Jeffrey. It’s a bit
dialog: o this, a bit o that.
text: Aaron takes it and starts puffing on it.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Why aren’t you with your lady?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I have a girlfriend who I’m going
dialog: to marry.
dialog: Aldous walks
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: If you have a girlfriend you’re
dialog: going to marry then this is the
dialog: only time you’1ll be able to do this
dialog: in good conscience. Once you’re
dialog: married you can’t have sex with a
text: random girl in a Vegas hotel suite.
dialog: But now you can.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: But I shouldn’t. And besides I
dialog: don’t want to either at all. She’s
dialog: a hot doctor. I didn’t think they
dialog: existed!
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: You've got to get it out of your
dialog: system. Otherwise it’s going to
dialog: emerge like a noxious shit bubble
dialog: years from now when you have a
dialog: little baby daughter. Do you want
dialog: to break your baby daughter’s
dialog: heart?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: No. I don’t.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Then go out there and fuck that
dialog: girl. It’s the morally correct
dialog: thing to do.
text: Aldous starts to pee in the toilet.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Man I had to pee the entire time we
dialog: were having sex. Isn’t that the
dialog: worst? As I came I was literally
dialog: thinking about Victoria Falls.
text: Aaron walks out of the bathroom back to the balcony. Aldous
text: carefully inspects his hair in the mirror. He sees one gray
text: hair. He carefully PLUCKS it out.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLAGIO SUITE - BALCONY - NIGHT
text: Aaron rejoins Krissy on the balcony and hands her the joint.
text: Krissy takes it and puffs it.
speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: Woh. What is that?
dialog: *
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Something called the Jeffrey.
dialog: (then)
dialog: If we do what I think we’re going
dialog: to do it’s important that I tell
dialog: you once more that I have a
dialog: girlfriend and shouldn’t be doing
dialog: this at all. In fact, I’m sorry I
dialog: even suggested we do anything.
dialog: This is clearly a highly
dialog: inappropriate situation and I
dialog: regret having offended and/or
dialog: dishonored you in any way.
speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: You're cute.
text: Krissy grabs Aaron and kisses him hard.
scene_heading: INT. BELLAGIO SUITE - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT
text: They fall into a bed. Krissy's “nice” shtick suddenly drop
text: and she becomes a voraciously sexual.
speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: Man you are a hot. You look like
dialog: Dennis Quaid.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Really? I never thought of myself--
text: Krissy tears off Aaron's pants.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Woh! I’m not sure about this --
speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: Get sure! Pump me!
text: Krissy removes her shirt and puts Aaron’s hands on her boobs.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Wow... these are really... hard.
speaker_heading: KRISSY
dialog: Silicone can get into your
dialog: bloodstream and fuck your shit up.
text: She goes down on Aaron. We can’t tell what she’s doing.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What is that? What are you doing?
dialog: I’m not sure but I think I love
dialog: what is currently happening to me.
dialog: Why can’t I stop narrating what is
dialog: happening to me while it’s
dialog: happening --

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Well let me just say that I did not
dialog: complete the sex! So there! I am

dialog: sensation! My heart is going like
dialog: crazy!
speaker_heading: JONATHAN SNOW
dialog: Why is jewboy talking so much?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: JONATHAN SNOW *
dialog: Well then I wouldn’t suck on that.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Why? It’s just a joint.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: No, it’s a Jeffrey.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Wait... what’s in this thing?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
text: A layer of pot. Then a layer of
dialog: opium. Then some crack. And a
dialog: little bit o meth. And the rolling
dialog: paper’s been dipped in acid. Oh,
dialog: and there also might be some angel
text: dust. Not sure.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Why the fuck is it called Jeffrey?
speaker_heading: JONATHAN SNOW *
dialog: Cause who could be scared of
dialog: Jeffrey? Jeffrey's just a nice
text: bloke from down the road.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I am having a heart attack.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: No you're not.
speaker_heading: JONATHAN SNOW *
dialog: He could be. The Jeffrey gives

dialog: attacks. I knew this footballer
dialog: who had a heart attack who had just
text: like one puff of the Jeffrey and
dialog: unlike, Jewfro, he had zero percent
text: body fat.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Don’t freak him out more.

dialog: You were a bastard as a kid and

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’ve smoked pot.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: That’s not drugs.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: It’s actually gotten a lot stronger

dialog: way higher than when our parents
dialog: smoked it... you’re right. It’s
dialog: not drugs.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: (then)
dialog: I don’t understand you. Why’d you

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Because of my girlfriend.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: What’s there to get?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Why are you in a relationship?
dialog: What is the advantage of it?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I don’t like choosing stuff, like
dialog: where I have to go to dinner. Or
dialog: my clothes. I like that my outfits

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS

dialog: This is just fascinating. I’ve
dialog: never met anyone like you.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Last year my family and Daphne’s
dialog: family had dinner and went to see

dialog: do for your birthday?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Me and about ninety-five people

text: then went out in a hot air balloon.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m not going to lie. Your life

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: But it’s missing love, Aaron.
dialog: Don’t you see? I want love the way
dialog: you have love. Without love, I’m
dialog: gonna become that bastard we just

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Is there a specific someone?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I’m in love with Jackie Q. I know
dialog: it now. She’s so gorgeous and sexy
dialog: and has these perfect tits.
dialog: Really, something. Like an angel's
dialog: tits. And she always kept me
dialog: guessing. I was with her at this
text: party in Monaco and she leans over
dialog: and whispers to me “I’m wet.” She
dialog: just said that to me, you know,
dialog: like she was telling me the
dialog: weather, with McCartney and Judi
dialog: Dench and the Dalai Lama just
dialog: standing like two feet away. I
dialog: swear I fell in love right then,
dialog: right there. Then later that week,
dialog: we're at a nightclub in Goa and she
dialog: went and made out with Emma Bunton
text: right in front of me. Under
dialog: different circumstances I would
dialog: have been happy to be seeing this,
dialog: this would have been my idea of
dialog: nirvana. But not this time. This
dialog: time I was mad. And as I watched
text: them make out and strip and begin
dialog: the process of engaging in oral sex
dialog: I got angrier and angrier till I
dialog: realized this was love, I was in
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: We have a kid together, you know.

dialog: Beautiful child.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: That's amazing, man. That’s the
dialog: reason we're here on Earth.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: It is, isn’t it? I even pay his
dialog: child support but I don’t mind
dialog: cause I love him so much. And her
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Why'd it end?
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I don’t know. I just don’t. I
dialog: want her back. She lives in LA and
dialog: I want to see her and get her back.
dialog: But I don’t know what to do. Like
dialog: when I first see her, what do I do?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Just be honest and tell her how you
dialog: feel. A good relationship, if
dialog: that’s what you want, is all about
dialog: honesty. The one thing is and I
dialog: don’t want to get into this if it
dialog: doesn’t matter, but isn’t she...
dialog: engaged... to Paul Allen?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: (turning dark)
dialog: You're right, if I’m honest I'11l
dialog: get her. And once I’ve gotten her
dialog: I can finally put an end to this
dialog: interminable, miserable single
dialog: life. Presently I can go wherever
dialog: I want with whoever I want and do
dialog: whatever I want to whomever I want.
dialog: It’s not as good as eating dinner
text: at 6:30 with the same person and
dialog: having nothing new to talk about
dialog: ever. It’s like when I was on
text: Branson’s private island in an
dialog: ecstasy orgy with these two Indian
dialog: models I was like “I wish I was

dialog: Angeles with the same person
dialog: forever.”

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: What do you do when you’re ina
dialog: relationship for that long. Like,
dialog: how do you keep it lively?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: It’s easy because we love each

dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: AARON/DAPHNE
dialog: On what?/Sometimes.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (ignoring Daphne)
dialog: On what?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Like if you could have done one

dialog: what would have been?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (joking)
dialog: What, like a threesome?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Sure like that.
speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

dialog: know, before I die.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Well that is something that is
dialog: possible right now. It’s not like

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: That would be hilarious, us having

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: We should do it.

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: C'mon, let’s do a threesome.
dialog: Wouldn’t that be fun?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I was speaking completely
dialog: theoretically. I’m not actually
dialog: sure whether we should really be
text: having a threesome in reality.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: You just said it’s something that
dialog: you'd like to try.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Well, I mean, it is.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: So why not try it? If we don’t
dialog: like it we don’t have to do it
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I got this mate who I had a

dialog: it and then he never had one again.
text: Daphne looks at Aaron like “see?”
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I mean, unless you’re scared.

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I am going to ejaculate!

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: This is bullshit.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (0.S.)

scene_heading: INT. AARON AND DAPHNE’S APARTMENT

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Hey, guys. Where do you want me to

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: C’mon, baby, get involved.
text: Aaron awkwardly tries to get into the action.

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: What’s the problem?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: You got it on me, man!
text: Aaron is frozen in terror/disgust.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS

text: unintentional sperming.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Hey, you gotta expect that kind of
dialog: thing is going to happen in this
dialog: sort of situation.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I am starving. I understand
dialog: there’s a delicious diner around
dialog: the corner. You interested, mate?
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Nahhh, I’m good, mate. I think I'd

speaker_heading: DAPHNE

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I don’t want to talk about this

dialog: cheating, right in front of me!
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I don’t think it’s cheating when
text: it’s a consensual threesome.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I thought you were cool with the
dialog: whole threesome thing.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: That wasn’t a threesome! That was
dialog: a twosome with me watching!
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: You could have jumped in. We
dialog: weren’t being exclusionary. That’s
dialog: against the rules.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: This isn’t about rules or not
dialog: rules! This is about you fucking
dialog: her right in front of me! And why
dialog: are you in this conversation? Why
dialog: are you even here?
text: Aldous leaves the room.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE

speaker_heading: AARON

dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: After you said it! If you didn’t
dialog: want to, why weren’t you honest
dialog: about that? I would’ve said no if
dialog: you didn’t want to do it.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I shouldn’t have to say anything to

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DAPHNE

text: revealing a box of needles. Aldous walks in.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I forgot my satchel.
speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: AARON
text: Congrats. Destruction complete.

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: You've been throwing them.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Yeah, but that one was in you. Now

text: forth with frighteningly fast abandon.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Draw! Draw!
dialog: 107.
text: They stop. Aldous throws another needle at Aaron. The

speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t you get it! I’m done! The
dialog: only person that ever loved me
dialog: hates me! I’m done making music!
dialog: I’m done! I might as well go kill

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Fine! Go ahead, you big baby!
dialog: Kill yourself! You just fucked my

dialog: I don’t give a shit what you do!
dialog: And make sure to swallow all the
dialog: pills! If you swallow only half
dialog: you just get sleepy! Better yet,
dialog: shoot yourself, but make sure to do
dialog: it in the head! That way you’ll
dialog: have the best shot at actually

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Why not? I’ve got nothing. I'ma

dialog: can’t even write music anymore.
dialog: I’m not even sure if I even ever
dialog: could. Most of my songs are just
dialog: ripoffs of the Beatles and the

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: No you aren’t. You can have sex

speaker_heading: ALDOUS

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Jumping’s for pussies. Jumping is

dialog: really going to be a pussy? You
dialog: really going to throw away the one
dialog: thing God has given us, life, for
dialog: nothing?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I didn’t know you were religious.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I didn’t know it either until right
dialog: now but I think I am and I think
dialog: what you’re doing is downright
dialog: immoral. In my one week with you
dialog: I’ve seen more of the world then I
dialog: have in my entire twenty three
dialog: years. Don’t throw it all away
dialog: man. Life is precious. Don’t just
text: toss it away like a used needle.

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Why’re you doing this? Do you love

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: No, I don’t love you. I kind of

speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Tell me you love me.
speaker_heading: AARON

scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN
text: Aldous rolls down the hill, crashing through a fence and --
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE POOL AND HOT TUB
text: -- into a Hills house backyard, splashing right into a hot

dialog: tub.
text: FULL SCREEN CHYRON: MINUS TWO HOURS SINCE THE CONCERT AT THE

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Fuck you, man! Fuck you!
text: Aaron jumps into the hot tub and flips Aldous over.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Aldous? Aldy? Aldous? Mr. Snow?
text: He pokes the body. No movement. He starts performing CPR on
text: Aldous, gingerly breathing into Aldous’s mouth and pumping

speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: (with each pump)
dialog: Fuck! You! Fuck! You! You!

text: talk, the hot tub slowly turns red with Aldous’s blood.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I’m alive. I’m alive! I can’t
dialog: believe I’m alive! You saved me,
dialog: Aaron. I can’t believe you came
dialog: and saved me.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I only came because I didn’t want
dialog: your death on conscience. I
dialog: thought that maybe I’d go to jail
dialog: if I didn’t show up.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I have completely changed as a
dialog: result of the love you've given me
dialog: by saving me.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: As soon as you see a girl with big
dialog: tits or a pound of hashish it’1l
dialog: start all over again.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: (starting to cry)
dialog: I look at you, Aaron, and I see
dialog: pure love. You are the most
dialog: beautiful person I have ever met.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m an enabler who is probably
dialog: responsible for the fact that you
dialog: have learned nothing and will be
text: smoking crack within the next
text: fifteen minutes.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I am going to prove you wrong.
dialog: That’s how I feel about you.
dialog: Because we are going to be best
dialog: friends forever.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I won’t because you fucked my
dialog: girlfriend and screwed me out of my
dialog: job.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: We can still make it.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: It’s over, man. The show was
dialog: supposed to start almost three
dialog: hours ago.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I’m always at least four hours
dialog: late. My fans all know this.
dialog: Once, in Manchester, I went on at
text: 2:10AM. Performed for six hours.
dialog: We can still make it.
text: (as they start to get out
dialog: of the tub)
dialog: My arm hurts.
text: Aaron looks at Aldous’s arm. The bone’s sticking through.
text: Aaron THROWS UP on Aldous.
scene_heading: INT. AARON’S CAR
text: Aaron's frantically driving Aldous.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Are you sure we shouldn’t go to the
dialog: emergency room?
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
text: It’s just pain. Pain is fleeting.
dialog: Love is forever. You have given me
dialog: love so in turn I shall give you
dialog: sobriety. From now on nothing’s
dialog: more important to me than my
dialog: sobriety.
text: Aldous opens up his manpurse and downs a bunch of pain pills.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: That’s the quickest trip to
dialog: hypocrisy maybe in history.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: There is literally no way I can
dialog: save your job right now without
dialog: fourteen Vicodin. My bone is
dialog: sticking out here. Touch it.
dialog: That’s bone.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Please stop referencing your bone.
text: Aldous touches his bone.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: It’s so weird. You can’t feel your
dialog: bone if you touch it. It’s like
text: touching a drumstick or something.
text: Aaron gags.
scene_heading: EXT. GREEK THEATER - ENTRANCE
text: Aaron and Aldous pull up the driveway to the Greek past a
text: giant sign that says “Aldous Snow -- LIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME

scene_heading: EXT. GREEK THEATER - BACKSTAGE
text: Aaron and a limping Aldous head backstage. The crowd is

text: Aldous is already on stage.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Allo, Los Angeles! Are you ready
dialog: to rock out?
text: The crowd cheers.
speaker_heading: SERGIO *
dialog: I guess he can. Congrats,

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m not an intern. I’m from *

speaker_heading: SERGIO *

text: cheers. Aaron smiles.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: This man, while he didn’t save me
dialog: from jumping off the Hollywood
dialog: sign, at least showed up. Even
dialog: after I made love to his
dialog: girlfriend. Now that’s true
dialog: friendship.
text: The crowd doesn’t know how to respond to this.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: I also wish to make an
dialog: announcement. I’m quitting drugs
dialog: and the alcohol.
text: The audience starts booing.
dialog: 117.

speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: If anyone ever sees me drinking a
dialog: beer or smoking a joint or doing
dialog: any other kind of controlled
dialog: substance you have my legal
dialog: permission to beat the living shit
dialog: out of me.
text: The crowd cheers like crazy.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: And a one! A two! A one two
dialog: three!
text: Aldous tries to strum the guitar and HOWLS IN PAIN.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: That fucking hurts! Holy shit that

text: Aldous unwraps his bandage to reveal his bone.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)

dialog: Ahhh! The pain!!!!!
text: The band stops playing.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Love explosion! It's a love
dialog: explosion! My love explodes into
dialog: your heart! It explodes all over
dialog: your chest!
text: It’s awesome. The crowd goes crazy. Aldous begins jumping
text: up and down and then PASSES OUT on the stage. In a moment of
text: odd enthusiasm, Aaron grabs the microphone and motions for
text: the band to start playing. Aaron continues the song.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: (singing)
dialog: My love explodes all over the
dialog: Earth! My loves explodes across
dialog: the universe!
text: The crowd BOOS.
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Well fuck you all too!
text: Aaron starts proudly parading around the stage flipping them
text: off as medics rush onstage to take care of Aldous. Aaron
text: rushes over to Aldous. Aldous’s eyes flutter open.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: Get your lady back, man. You’re
dialog: too much of a pussy to live in this
text: world without her.
scene_heading: EXT. DAPHNE’S PARENTS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Aaron pulls up to Daphne’s parents’ house. It’s a nice house
text: on the ocean in Laguna. He runs up to the door. Not wanting
text: to wake anyone up, he knocks lightly on the door. Then he
text: finally hits the doorbell. A very long door chime version of
text: “Lollipop” plays. Mr. Binks opens the door.
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: What the hell time is it?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Five a.m. Is Daphne here?
speaker_heading: MR. BINKS
dialog: I don’t think she wants to see you.

speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: Aaron? What're you doing here?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m sorry I called you a whore.
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I deserved it.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: No one deserves to be called a
dialog: whore. Not even an actual whore.
dialog: I want to get back together.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I do too. Desperately.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: But only if you promise never to
text: have sex with another man in front
dialog: of me.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: And one other thing, I do
dialog: understand what it takes to be a
dialog: creative type. And when you say I
dialog: don't it's condescending and bitchy
dialog: and I don’t like it at all and
dialog: rather than whining about whether
dialog: your sculptures will or won't sell
dialog: or whether people will or won't
dialog: like them you should just get a
dialog: fucking gallery and show them
dialog: already.
text: As the sun rises through the windows of their Great Room,
text: Daphne tears down the stairs --
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I love you when you're honest.
text: -- and kisses him.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: While I was watching him there was
dialog: nothing he was doing that I
dialog: couldn’t physically do -- except
dialog: for that one thing on the floor. I
dialog: just wouldn’t have the courage to
dialog: ask you.
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: You don’t have to do every thing
dialog: Aldous did. But maybe one of the
dialog: twelve things.
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Great. So let’s go do this --
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I can’t do it now. I have some
dialog: kind of infection down there. I
dialog: hate that fucking guy. It stings
dialog: so bad.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I’m so sorry, baby.
text: Aaron hugs Daphne.
scene_heading: MRS. BINKS
dialog: (oddly touched)
dialog: Awww.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: So when should we do this?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE
dialog: I can have sex again in three
dialog: weeks.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Three weeks is a long time from
dialog: now. It’ll give me time to prepare
dialog: mentally.
scene_heading: INT. AARON AND DAPHNE’S BEDROOM —- NIGHT
scene_heading: CHYRON: EXACTLY THREE WEEKS LATER.
text: A nervous looking Aaron looks at something.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: You sure you’re OK with this?
speaker_heading: DAPHNE (0.S.)
dialog: For the third time, yes!
text: REVEAL Daphne is tied up.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: And you promise you won't be
dialog: thinking of Aldous while we're

speaker_heading: DAPHNE

scene_heading: EXT. YOSEMITE - DAY
text: Aaron, Aldous, and Naples are hiking. As they hike, Aldous is
text: sucking down a sucrose gel pack.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: I’m just incredibly grounded these
dialog: days. Eight months clean.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: That’s really great. I’m
dialog: impressed. And it’s so great to
dialog: see that you’ve reconnected with
dialog: your son.
speaker_heading: NAPLES
dialog: I’m not his son.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS
dialog: He’s just my mate. His dad’s
dialog: actually Hugh Grant. Who knew?
dialog: He’s staying with me for the month.
dialog: His mother’s kind of a W-H-O-R-E.
text: He sucks down another gel pack.
speaker_heading: ALDOUS (CONT'D)
dialog: The point is I’m finally living the
dialog: clean life we’re all meant to live
dialog: and it’s all because of you. Thank
dialog: you, Aaron, for pulling me back
dialog: from the edge and showing me the
dialog: way towards a healthy, safe

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: NAPLES
dialog: Kind of.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: OVER CREDITS:
