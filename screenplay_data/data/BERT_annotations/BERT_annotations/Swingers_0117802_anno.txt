scene_heading: 1 EXT. HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT 1
text: The soundtrack opens with Frank Sinatra's "Fly Me to the
dialog: Moon".
text: A HELICOPTER SHOT OF THE L.A. basin.
text: The pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of
text: points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the
dialog: city.
text: We are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we
text: approach Hollywood Boulevard. Below is neon and the icy
text: thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of Hollywood
dialog: and Vine.
text: We continue west, then quickly north.
text: There is the momentary appearance of the moonlit HOLLYWOOD
text: sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the Capital
text: Records building and drop into Franklin avenue and over the
dialog: 101.
text: Architectural remnants of Hollywood's past whip up. We are
text: heading east at treetop level. A warm glow in the distance
text: quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes
text: cafes, bookstores, and a theater.
text: We drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass
text: showcase window of the "Bourgeois Pig" coffeehouse, which
text: holds the translucent reflection of the full moon.
text: A cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders. MIKE takes
text: the last drag with great effort, then crushes it out. He
text: sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that
text: once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer.

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And what if I don't want to give up on
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: You don't call.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But you said I shouldn't call if I
dialog: wanted to give up on her.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So I don't call either way.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So what's the difference?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: The only difference between giving up and
dialog: not giving up is if you take her back
dialog: when she wants to come back. See, you
dialog: can't do anything to make her want to
dialog: come back. You can only do things to
dialog: make her not want to come back.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So the only difference is if I forget
dialog: about her or pretend to forget about her.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Well that sucks.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: It sucks.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So it's almost a retroactive decision.
dialog: So I could, like, let's say, forget about
dialog: her and when she comes back make like I
dialog: just pretended to forget about her.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Right...or more likely the opposite.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Right... Wait, what do you mean?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I mean first you'll pretend not to care,
dialog: not call - whatever, and then,
dialog: eventually, you really won't care.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: Unless she comes back first.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they
dialog: don't come back until you really don't
dialog: care anymore.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: There's the rub.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: There's the rub.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about
dialog: the same thing all the time...
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Hey man, don't sweat it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ...It's just that you've been there.
dialog: Your advice really helps.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Rob, I just want you to know, you're the
dialog: only one I can talk to about her.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Thanks. Thanks, man.

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It didn't feel that way.
scene_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE

dialog: That's because it was a challenge. You

scene_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRENT

dialog: beautiful babies there.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Trent, I don't feel like going out
dialog: tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Listen to you. I got an audition for a

text: can't sit home thinking about her.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I don't know, I don't know- listen to
dialog: you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We
dialog: gotta get you out of that stuffy

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We're gonna spend half the night driving
dialog: around the Hills looking for this party
dialog: and then leaving cause it sucks, then
dialog: we're gonna look for this other party you
dialog: heard about. But, Trent, all the parties
dialog: and bars, they all suck. I spend half

text: who's eyes are darting around to see if
dialog: there's someone else she should be
dialog: talking to. And it's like I'm supposed
dialog: to be all happy cause she's wearing a

dialog: who wouldn't be shit if they weren't
text: surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny
dialog: assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those

speaker_heading: VEGAS.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What Vegas?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: We're going to Vegas.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wait.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What are you wearing? I mean, we should
dialog: wear suits.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high
dialog: roller.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and
dialog: you act like you gamble a lot, they give

speaker_heading: TRENT

text: Mike is dressed to the nines in classic vintage threads.
text: He's trying to look at ease as he straightens his cuff links.
text: He approaches Trent who suavely leans against his worn down
text: ride. He's a tall, slim, good-looking cat. His sharkskin
text: suit hangs well on his lanky frame as it tapers to his
text: ankles. Sinatra's "Come Fly With Me" on the tape deck adds
text: an elegance to the scene. They exchange an impish grin and

dialog: idea.

dialog: they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then
dialog: we trade back the chips at the end of the
dialog: night. You gotta be cool though.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy
dialog: a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's
dialog: singing.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm
dialog: telling you.
speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
text: Trent points out a mountain range. It is now the only thing
text: separating them from their destination. The surreal glow of
text: the desert sky is accentuated by the loud slashing of the
text: cobalt and ruby lasers emanating from a source masked by
text: the craggy peaks. Mike slowly stirs from his slumber. He is

dialog: Vegas.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 11 EXT. VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT 11
text: The shrill cry of Basie's fat brass section heralds the

text: of golden light as Sinatra's crooning urges them on.
dialog: Mike has either had enough sleep or so little that it no
text: longer matters. Either way, there's no turning back.
text: They roll up to a casino valet. TILT UP to a skull and
text: crossbones which looms overhead.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 12 INT. TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - NIGHT 12
text: The two guys walk and talk down a fluorescent hallway. It is
text: well past midnight and the only patrons at this hour are
text: tourists too drunk to sleep and compulsive gamblers who snuck
text: out of their rooms without waking their wives.
text: It is a weeknight and it is beginning to become painfully
text: obvious that our boys are overdressed.
text: The decor is nautical plaster. Castings of bearded men with
text: primitive prosthesis clutching daggers between their teeth
dialog: are everywhere.
text: All of ye olde promenade shoppes are closed.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (the first budding of
dialog: crankiness)
dialog: Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: This is the hot new place, besides, you
dialog: love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love
dialog: pirates.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This is fuckin' post-pubescent
dialog: Disneyland.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You gotta love the pirates, baby. The
dialog: pirates are money.
text: The corridor empties into the equally kitch CASINO.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This place is dead. I thought this was
dialog: the city that never sleeps.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: That's New York, baby. You should know
dialog: that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna
dialog: get me a peg-leg baby.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They're all skanks.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Tee, the beautiful babies don't work
dialog: Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the
text: skank shift.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What are you talking about? Look at all
dialog: the honeys.
text: Trent contorts his face at a cute WAITRESS passing by with a
text: tray of drinks.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Arrrrg!
text: The waitress cracks a smile as she crosses away. Mike is
text: visibly embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Cut that shit out.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: She smiled baby.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's not cool.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Did she, or did she not smile?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It doesn't matter...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I'm telling you, they love that shit.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You're gonna screw up our plan.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: We're gonna get laid, baby.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: First let's see what happens if we play
dialog: it cool.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What? You think she's gonna tell her
dialog: pit-boss on us?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Don't make fun, I think we can get some
dialog: free shit if we don't fuck around.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun.
dialog: Let's do it, baby.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: The trick is to look like you don't need
dialog: it, then they give you shit for free.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Well, you look money, baby. We both
dialog: look money.
text: Mike points to a semi-curtained, semi-roped-off area near the
text: baccarat tables. The clientele is classier, but they're
text: still obviously overdressed.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: That's where we make our scene.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You think they're watching?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oh, they're watching all right. They're
dialog: watching.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 13 INT. TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - THE CLASSY SECTION - NIGHT 13
text: Mike is at a blackjack table with Trent at his side. The
text: game has paused to observe the newcomers as Mike draws a
text: billfold out of his breast pocket. They're pulling it off
text: with only slightly noticeable effort.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't know, I guess I'll start with
dialog: three hundred in, uh, blacks.
text: Mike tries to hand the DEALER a handful of twenties after
dialog: counting them twice.
speaker_heading: DEALER
text: On the table.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: You have to lay it on the table.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
text: The other players grow impatient.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: You're not allowed to hand me money, sir.
dialog: You'll have to lay it on the table if you
dialog: want me to change it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (hastily laying down the bills)
dialog: Oh... right.
text: The dealer lays out the bills such that the amount is visible
text: to the camera encased in the black glass globe overhead.
text: Trent and Mike look up at it open-mouthed like turkeys in the
dialog: rain.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Blacks?
text: Mike's attention is recaptured by the dealer, but Trent
text: continues trying to peer through the smoked glass.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: You want this in black chips.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sure, that'll be fine.
text: The dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the PIT
text: BOSS chirps the response. Trent's focus whips away from the
text: camera as both he and Mike stare at the pit boss ten feet
dialog: away.
text: The dealer plunks down the measly THREE CHIPS which represent
text: Mike's entire cash reserve. Not quite the effect he had
dialog: hoped for.
text: The swingers stare at the chips. The players stare at the
text: swingers. The dealer stares at the pit boss.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Do you have anything smaller?
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a
dialog: hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps
dialog: you'd be more comfortable at one of our
dialog: lower stakes tables.
text: The dealer indicates a FIVE-DOLLAR TABLE across the room
text: where an Hispanic woman deals to a BLUEHAIR, a BIKER, and a
text: COUPLE in matching Siegfried and Roy T-shirts.
text: The swingers look back to the dealer who is now flanked by
dialog: the pit boss.
text: The tense silence is broken by...
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Drinks?
dialog: (then to Trent)
dialog: How about you, Cap'n?
text: Trent looks over to see that it's the same WAITRESS who
text: flashed him a smile earlier. At first he begins to smile,
text: then, remembering that he is locked in a high stakes battle
text: of wills, subtly shakes her off. She smirks and starts to
text: leave until she is interrupted by Mike holding up a finger.
text: It's a balsy move, but everyone's watching. The kid's going
dialog: for broke.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (to the waitress, but never
dialog: breaking eye contact with the
dialog: dealer)
dialog: I'll have a vodka martini, straight up,
text: shaken not stirred, very dry.
text: Smooth. Trent is impressed, but masks his pride.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
text: (under her breath cynically as
dialog: she writes it down)
dialog: One "James Bond".
text: Ow. She exits.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (regaining composure)
dialog: No. Blacks will be fine.
text: Mike throws a chip in the circle. Trent is shocked. That's
text: a hundred bucks. Mike and Trent share a look. The dealer
text: and the pit boss exchange glances. Bets are all down and the
text: cards are meticulously dealt.
text: The dealer has a two showing. Mike has been dealt a five and
dialog: a six- eleven.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (hushed tones)
dialog: Double down.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (even husheder)
dialog: What?!?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Double down, baby. You gotta double down
dialog: on an eleven.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I know, but...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You gotta do it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ...but that's two hundred dollars.
dialog: This is blood money...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: If we don't look like we know what we're
dialog: doing, then we may as well...
text: Everyone's waiting for them.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I know.
text: The dealer, the pit boss, and all the players look on as Mike
text: drops ANOTHER BLACK CHIP in the circle with a barely audible,
text: yet deafening, thud.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (with all the nonchalance he
dialog: can muster)
dialog: Double down.
text: A bead of sweat.
text: The sharp snap of a dealt card.
text: It's a seven. Eighteen.
text: Disappointment twists their faces.
text: Finally the dealer flips over his card.
dialog: It's a king! Twelve. Here comes the bust...
dialog: Flick - four. Sixteen! Here comes the bust...
text: Flick - five. Twenty one. Groans all around, except for the
text: swingers who watch their chips slide away in silence.
text: Mike breaks the spell with a plucky smile from the pit of his
dialog: stomach.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (to the pit boss)
dialog: Sure could use some dinner about now.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: Trent and Mike are wedged between the BLUEHAIR and the BIKER
text: At the FIVE DOLLAR TABLE. They share a pile of red chips.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I'm telling you, baby, you always double
text: down on an eleven.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah? Well obviously not always!
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Always, baby.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm just saying, not in this particular
dialog: case.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Always.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But I lost! How can you say always?!?
text: In the meantime, the Bluehair has been dealt an eleven.
text: This captures the swinger's attention.
speaker_heading: BLUEHAIR
dialog: Hit.
text: Four. Fifteen all together.
speaker_heading: BLUEHAIR
dialog: Oh... I don't know... Hit.
text: Two. Seventeen. Dealer has a seven showing.
speaker_heading: BLUEHAIR
dialog: What the hell- hit.
dialog: Four! Twenty one.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: (with a warm smile)
dialog: Twenty one.
text: Polite applause from around the table which the Bluehair
text: humbly waves off. Mike looks at Trent. Daggers. Trent
dialog: shrugs.
text: A different PIT BOSS approaches.
speaker_heading: PIT BOSS
dialog: Would you care for some breakfast, ma'am?
speaker_heading: BLUEHAIR
dialog: Well...? No, I shouldn't. Maybe later.

speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What's that? One twenty? You're up
dialog: twenty bucks, baby.

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yea, how much?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Don't give me that shit. You know
dialog: exactly how much you lost. What'd you
dialog: drop?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Twenty... but I was down at least fifty.
dialog: I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You won. There's nothing to be sorry
dialog: about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin

speaker_heading: CHRISTY

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I

speaker_heading: CHRISTY

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Baby, this is what we came for. We met

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: She likes you.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You gotta get that girl out of your head.
dialog: It's time to move on. You're a stylish,

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's bullshit.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: It's not. You're money. Any of these
dialog: ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It's just that I've been out of the game

dialog: years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared.
dialog: I don't know how to talk to them, I don't
dialog: know...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You can't think like that, baby. It's
dialog: hard, I know. I've been there. Not for

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It's just tough, after sleeping with

speaker_heading: TRENT

text: College. A Mets cap shades his eyes. Neither have shaved
dialog: and, odds are, neither showered. They each carry a loose
text: nine blade and putter as they wander to their lie.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I don't think I'm gonna take it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I's a gig.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I mean, I need the money.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You're an actor. Find the Zen in the
dialog: role.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: It's definitely a step back for me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Look, there's not much of a call for
dialog: Shakespeare in this town.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: There's just something about being
dialog: "Goofy". Any other Disney character
dialog: would be fine. There's just this stigma
dialog: associated with the character.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What do you want? You're tall.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Do you realize how hard it's going to be
dialog: to tell my parents? I still haven't told
dialog: them I didn't get the pilot.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You tested over a month ago. I'm sure
dialog: they figured it out by now.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be
dialog: starring in that sit-com and, oh by the
dialog: way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
text: They split up and both over-chip the green miserably.

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Haven't you noticed I didn't mention
dialog: Michelle once today?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I didn't want to say anything.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I don't know. It's like not talking to
text: a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Kinda.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't talk about her that much.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Oh no?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I didn't mention her once today.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Well, until now. Tend the pin.
text: Mike pulls out the flag for Rob's putt. He misses.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: The only reason I mentioned her at all is
dialog: to say that I'm not going to talk about
dialog: her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I do. Good for you, man.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I've decided to get out there.
dialog: (re: the ball)
dialog: Go ahead. Play it out.
text: Rob putts the "gimme". He misses by an inch.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm not making any more excuses for
dialog: myself.
text: Rob taps it in. He tends the pin or Mike, who misses.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Good to hear, Mikey.
text: Mike putts again, and misses.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You want to hit the town tonight?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What do you have? A Pluto call back?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
text: Mike plunks it in.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Count 'em up.
text: The two of them count and recount as they revisualize each
text: shot in their head. Throughout the process they count under
text: their breath and point to different parts of the fairway and
dialog: green.
text: The two of them revolve, point, and mumble for an absurdly
dialog: long amount of time until finally...
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: How many strokes?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't know. Eight or Nine.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I'll give you an eight.
dialog: (writes score)
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What'd you get?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: An eight.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Looks like we're in a dead heat after one
dialog: hole. This is turning into quite a
dialog: rivalry.
text: Rob points to the far-off crowd of a dozen IRATE GOLFERS

text: natives look restless.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 30 INT. SUE'S APARTMENT - HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EVENING 30
dialog: First of all, SUE is a guy, and a tough guy at that. He is
text: wearing an L.A. Kings home jersey. His sweater bears the
text: sacred number "99". Sue is lounging in front of the TV in
text: army surplus khaki cutoffs and untied Doc Martin boots.
text: Sue brushes back a shock of straight, greasy, dirty blonde
text: hair as not to obscure his view of the screen. His face
text: glows with the reflection of the SEGA HOCKEY game on the set.
text: Sue and TRENT are locked in a heavily contested battle of
text: motor reflexes. Nothing moves but their eyes, thumbs, and
dialog: mouths...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Bitch... You little bitch!
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Chelios to Roenick...!
text: MIKE looks on. He is more captivated with the simulated
text: sporting event than the Clippers game on the TV across the
dialog: room.
text: Electric guitars blaze over the stereo.
dialog: The room, like the guys, could use a spring cleaning. Pizza
text: boxes, beer bottles, and full, full ashtrays. You can taste
dialog: the smoke.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You little bitch!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Because he's a bitch.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You should play another team. The Kings
dialog: are bitches in this game.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... against the computer.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: They're a finesse team...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: They're a bitch team... SCORE!
dialog: Roenick!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Give it up, Sue.
text: The PHONE RINGS. Sue picks it up and balances it on his
text: shoulder as he plays.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (re: game)
dialog: Shit!
dialog: (back to phone)
text: Yeah. The elevator doesn't work.
text: (he lets the phone drop. Then
dialog: to Mike)
dialog: It's Pink Dot. Buzz him in - hit nine.
text: Mike picks up the phone off the matted shag carpet. He
text: pushes "9", listens, then hangs up.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I wish the game still had fights so I
dialog: could bitch-slap Wayne.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This version doesn't have fighting?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: No. Doesn't that suck?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What? That was the best part of the old
dialog: game.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I don't know. I guess kids were hitting
dialog: each other or something.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You could make their heads bleed, though.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads
text: bleed all over the ice and their legs
text: convulse.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It's kinda money, actually.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Make someone bleed.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No, man, we're in the play-offs.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I'll make Gretsky bleed, the little
dialog: bitch.
text: The DELIVERY MAN knocks on the door.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Pause it.
dialog: (Trent pauses the game)
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Give me the money. I'll get it.
text: While Sue gives Mike the money, Trent UNPAUSES the game and
text: checks Gretsky into the boards, leaving him writhing in a
text: pool of red pixels.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You bitch!
text: Sue dives onto Trent. They wrestle a little too
text: rambunctiously for indoors. Trent pulls the hockey sweater
text: over Sue's head and starts wailing on his back.
text: Mike crosses. The CAMERA follows him down a shallow hallway
text: to the door. He unlocks it.
text: A delivery man of eastern-hemispheric decent is out of breath
text: from four flights of stairs. He hands Mike a twelve-pack of
text: Bud cans and three packs of Marlboro reds.
text: He can HEAR, but NOT SEE, the chaos ensuing in the living
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 31 INT. SUE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 31

speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (feigning homosexuality)
dialog: Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay
dialog: for a cocktail!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (following suit)
dialog: ... Is he brown?
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: 32 INT. SUE'S DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS 32
text: Mike forces an apologetic smile. He is embarrassed. The
text: delivery man doesn't seem to understand any of this.
text: Mike, out of guilt, hands him a four dollar tip. This he
text: seems to understand. He smiles and leaves.
text: Mike crosses back to the main room.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You guys are such assholes.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (continuing the gag)
dialog: Aww... He got away?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (untangling himself from
dialog: Trent)
dialog: Gimme my reds. I've been jonesing for an
dialog: hour.
text: Mike throws him a pack of smokes, which he unravels with
dialog: surgical precision.
text: Cans of beer are tossed around and cracked.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What time's this party tonight?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: It starts at eight...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... which means no one will get there
dialog: 'til ten.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So, what? Eleven?
speaker_heading: TRENT & SUE
dialog: Midnight.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'm gonna bring and old friend who just
dialog: moved out here.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Who? Rob?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah. You met him once.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (approvingly)
dialog: Yeah. He's a "rounder".
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What's he do?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He's trying to be an actor.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What a surprise...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... How novel.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 33 EXT. DARK ALLEY - OFF OF HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - SEEDY - NIGHT 33
text: MIKE and ROB walk down the dirty deserted alleyway. Mike is
text: wearing baggy slacks, Doc Martin shoes, and an oversized
text: Eisenhower-cut jacket with a vertical stripe inset. The
text: collar is large and pointy, but definitely not seventies.
text: His ensemble has more of an early sixties vibe.
text: Rob hasn't been at it quite as long. He's wearing worn-in
text: Levies over worn-in boots and, the nineties standby, an
text: untucked flannel.
text: Mike walks with purpose. He intermittently tries to pull
text: open locked steel doors along the alley. Rob looks confused.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: So, if the party starts at eight, why are
dialog: we first going to a bar at ten?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: To get a drink before we meet the guys
dialog: for a bite at eleven.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where is this place?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (pulling handle)
dialog: It's one of these. For some reason, cool
dialog: bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find
text: and have no signs out front.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: That doesn't sound too good for business.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (pull)
dialog: It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of
dialog: thing. It's kinda cool. It's like
dialog: you're in on some kind of secret. You
dialog: tell a chick you've been some place, it's
dialog: like bragging that you know how to find
dialog: it. The only way you could know where a
dialog: place is is if someone who knows brought
dialog: you there. You have to have someone come
dialog: before. There is a direct line
dialog: connecting you back to the original,
dialog: unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's
dialog: kinda like Judaism...
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Sounds more like Aids...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ... That's probably a more appropriate
dialog: analogy.
text: At this point they come upon an unmarked BLACK METAL DOOR,
text: which Mike successfully pulls open to reveal...
scene_heading: 34 INT. "THE ROOM" - HOLLYWOOD BAR - SAME 34
text: A smoke-filled, windowless, black-walled room. There are
text: several round padded booths lining the walls. The place is
text: packed, and the funk standard "Brick House" throbs over the
dialog: P.A..
text: A HANDHELD SHOT as the two guys serpentine to the mirrored
text: bar at the far end of the room. Enshrined in its center is
text: a framed photograph of SINATRA smiling in approval as he
text: presides over the evening's activities.
text: Mike proudly points out the photo to Rob.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Kinda money, huh?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Classy.
text: Mike catches the attention of a cute female BARTENDER.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'll get a Dewars rocks...
dialog: (looks to Rob)
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Bud.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: ...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud,
dialog: please.
dialog: She goes.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I can't get over how cute the girls in
dialog: this city are.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I know. It's like the opposite of
dialog: inbreeding. The hottest one percent from
dialog: around the world migrate to this gene
dialog: pool.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Darwinism at its best.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I've been around here six months and I
text: still can't get over it.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: It's like, every day I see a beautiful
dialog: woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used
dialog: to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't
dialog: know, once a week. I can't handle it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wait till summer. I swear, you can't
dialog: leave the house. It hurts. It
dialog: physically hurts.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I can't wait till I actually get to touch
text: one of them.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Ah, there's the rub...
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: There's the rub.
text: The bartender serves them their drinks.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (o.s.)
dialog: Whassup Mikey?
text: Mike turns to see CHARLES. A young black man with a tight
text: Dolomite fro. He wears a black leather blazer over a black
dialog: turtleneck. Just look up "cool" in the dictionary.
text: A handshake turns into a hug.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Charles! What's up, man?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Oh. You know.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause
dialog: you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that
dialog: funny anyway...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ... piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this
dialog: is my friend Rob from Back East.
dialog: Shake.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: My pleasure.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Charles and me went to network on this
dialog: pilot together.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I just tested for one...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ... yeah, a month ago.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You haven't told then, huh?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I still haven't told my folks I didn't
dialog: get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a
dialog: figured it out by now, but Mom keeps
dialog: asking...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ... and boy does it hurt when they ask.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I don't even tell them about anything I'm
dialog: close on anymore...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ... not until you book it...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ... and even then...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ... you might get cut out.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I'm considering taking a job as a
dialog: "Goofy".
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You want to come with us to a party at
dialog: the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow
dialog: and lots of beautiful babies.

text: The CAMERA REVOLVES around the table in a repeating
text: "Reservoir Dogs" style over the shoulder 360 DEGREE PAN.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... No, baby. I got a better one. You
dialog: gotta admit the steadycam shot in

speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: ... through the basement of that

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ... the Copa, in New York...
speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ... That's what I heard...
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... It looked money.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... Not as money as the shot from
dialog: Reservoir Dogs...
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: ... Which one?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... In the beginning. When they're

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Oh, like that song...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ... "A Boy Named Sue". I think that's

speaker_heading: ROB

scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
text: The group's P.O.V. of the conversation.
text: The JAWS THEME reaches its violent crescendo as the girl
text: looks into her purse.
text: Trent winks to the boys. Smooth.
text: She comes up with a pen and writes our her phone number.
text: Trent crosses back as the music dies away.
text: Using his body as a shield so the girl can't see, but so his
text: boys can, he rips up and drops the number as he approaches
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Was I money?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don't know. It was kind of a dick move
dialog: if you ask me.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You asked her for her number, and then
dialog: you tore it up.
speaker_heading: TRENT
text: She didn't see.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: That was pretty cold, dude.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What was cold about it?
text: The door opens. The party PAUSES to look, then RESUMES.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: She offered me her number. What should
dialog: I have said? "No"? That would've hurt
dialog: her feelings. This way she feels like
dialog: the winner.
text: Trent smiles and waves to her across the room. She coyly
text: waves back and makes a "phone sign" with her hand. Trent
text: nods and smiles.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Tee can't roll with that, she's "business
dialog: class".
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: "Business class"?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (explaining to Rob)
dialog: Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I can't believe you.
text: Charles approaches the crew.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: They're out of Glenlivet.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What else is going on?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: We could hit the Dresden.
text: Overhead LONG SHOT of the swingers entrenched in the CROWDED

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yeah. This place is dead, anyway.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 46 EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU MARMONT - NIGHT 46
text: The swingers have left the party and are heading to their
text: cars. They are all parked in a row, one behind the other.
text: They each climb behind the wheel of their own car. They pull
text: out in UNISON.
text: They travel like a train with their bumpers ALMOST TOUCHING.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 49 INT. "THE DRESDEN ROOM" - SAME 49
text: The SWINGERS lounge in a booth against the cork-paneled wall,
text: sipping cocktails. They watch MARTY and ELAYNE, the resident
text: lounge act, perform a jazz fusion cover of "Staying Alive" on
text: synth and upright bass. The seventies are alive and well
text: here, but they're starting to yellow around the edges...
text: The room is busy, but not packed.
dialog: The swingers have all had a few.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I know what you're saying, man. I don't
dialog: know what to tell you...
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: ... I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"?
dialog: I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two
dialog: months ago, for crying out loud...
text: Trent and Sue are involved in a different conversation. They
text: are observing two HOT GIRLS at another cocktail table.
text: The girls are wearing short plaid skirts with black stockings
text: pulled up to midthigh. It's the "catholic-school-girl-gone-
dialog: bad" look.
text: The girls are a little too touchy-feely with each other,
text: suggesting a certain sexual open-mindedness.
speaker_heading: TRENT
text: It's on.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond
dialog: trail...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... double diamond...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... but it's worth the risk. True or
dialog: false: It's worth the risk.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: True.
text: As they get up to leave...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: God bless you guys.
text: They cross to the ladies.
dialog: Mike's P.O.V.
text: The girls seem at first cold, the receptive. Trent and Sue
text: join their table and share some laughs.
text: Mike half-heartedly looks on. He is obviously not happy with
text: where he stands on the bell-curve of masculinity.
text: Mike, looking for any kind of escape, crosses to the bar.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 50 INT. BAR - DRESDEN ROOM - SAME 50
text: Mike unsuccessfully tries to catch the attention of the
text: middle aged BARTENDER.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I can't even get this guy to notice me...
text: A cute BLONDE sitting at the bar chuckles at his comment.
text: Mike is at first self-conscious, then pushes ahead.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You like laughing at the misery of
dialog: others?
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me
dialog: make it up to you.
text: She raises her finger and the bartender immediately
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What can I get you?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'll have a Dewars on the rocks.
text: He goes to fix it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: I've seen you somewhere...Where have I
dialog: seen you?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: ... maybe...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ... Monday nights? I host an open
dialog: mike...
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: You're a comedian?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: What's that like?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (trying to bluff, not an ounce
dialog: of sarcasm)
dialog: Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of
dialog: traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you
dialog: know, it's a dream... and the money's
dialog: really good. I think I might buy another
dialog: really expensive imported car after my
dialog: next gig in Vegas...
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: (politely interrupting)
dialog: I know! Starbucks! I served you an
text: espresso at Starbucks.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Are you sure? Maybe...
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Yes! Remember? You asked me for an
dialog: application? I introduced you to the
dialog: manager?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (trying to pull out of the
dialog: dive)
dialog: Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a
dialog: while ago.
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: I'd say about two weeks.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Probably a little longer than that, but,
dialog: whatever.
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: (smiling at him)
dialog: You better pay the man.
text: Mike notices the bartender, who has been waiting patiently
text: with the drink.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (fumbling with the money)
dialog: Oh... Sorry.
text: She chuckles. He pays and throws down a two-dollar tip
text: apologetically.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (tactical retreat)
dialog: Well, thank you...?
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Nikki.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Thank you, Nikki.
text: He walks away kicking himself. He is interrupted by Trent
text: and Sue, who both hold up cocktail napkins with scribbles.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: We got the digits, baby.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What a surprise.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What's wrong? I saw you talking to that
text: beautiful blonde baby.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: She was cute.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: She didn't like me... I made a fool of
dialog: myself...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You are so money, and you don't even know
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: That's what I keep trying to tell him.
dialog: (to Mike)
dialog: You're so money, you don't even know...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Please, don't mess with me right now...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: We're not messing with you...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... we're not...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You're like this big beer with claws and
dialog: fangs...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... and big fuckin' teeth...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... and teeth... And she's like this
text: little bunny cowering in the corner...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ...shivering...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... And you're just looking at your claws
dialog: like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ...You're just poking at it...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... Yeah. You're just gently batting it
dialog: around... and the rabbit's all scared...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... and you got big claws and fangs...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... and fangs... and you're like "I don't
dialog: know what to do. How do I kill this
dialog: bunny?"...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... you're like a big bear.
text: Beat. Mike smiles.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You're not just, like, fucking with me?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: No, baby!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... honestly...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... you're money...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... you're so fuckin mmmoney.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Now go over there and get those digits.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You're money.
speaker_heading: TRENT
text: (pulling him aside, dead
dialog: serious)
dialog: Now when you talk to her, I don't want
dialog: you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that
dialog: everyone's pulling for. I want you to be
dialog: the guy in the rated R movie who you're
dialog: not sure if you like.
text: Mike nods and, energized by the bombardment, crosses back to
text: the bar and right into the fray.
text: Trent and Sue rejoin the other swingers.
text: Swinger's P.O.V. of Mike decisively engaging her in
dialog: conversation.
text: She laughs.
text: Out comes the pen and the cocktail napkin. Bingo.
text: Mike crosses back to the swingers' table and, using his body
text: to shield Nikki's view, pretends to rip the napkin. This
text: breaks the guys up.
text: Mike sits down and, after admiring the blotchy numerals,
text: delicately folds the napkin and pockets it.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: See, baby. It's not that hard.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: 818?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 310.
text: Everyone reacts favorably to this area code.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How long do I wait to call?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: A day.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Tomorrow?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... Tomorrow, then a day.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... Yeah.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So, two days?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Definitely. Two days. That's the
dialog: industry standard...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (to Sue. shop talk)
dialog: ... I used to wait two days. Now
dialog: everyone waits two days. Three days is
dialog: kinda money now, don't you think?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... Yeah. But two's enough not to look
dialog: anxious...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Yeah, but three days is kinda the
dialog: money...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (interrupting sarcastically)
dialog: Why don't I just wait three weeks and
dialog: tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and
dialog: found her number...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ... then ask where you met her...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and
dialog: then I'll ask what she looks like.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that,
dialog: Tee? Is that "the money"?
text: The guys laugh.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Laugh all you want, but if you call to
dialog: soon you can scare off a nice baby who's
dialog: ready to party.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Don't listen to him. You call whenever
dialog: it feels right to you.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How long are you guys gonna wait to call
dialog: your honeys?
speaker_heading: TRENT & SUE
dialog: Six days.

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Watch where you're going, asshole.
speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: What'd you say, bitch?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I said watch where you're going, bitch!
text: That's it. Now they're squaring off in the empty parking
dialog: lot.
text: All the bald guy's boys fall in behind him. All the swingers
text: fall in behind Sue. The swingers are not happy with Sue at
dialog: all.
text: The two cliques contrast each other in every way.
text: The bald guys all have facial hair and multiple pierced
text: extremities with the odd neck-tattoo thrown in for good
dialog: measure.
text: Baggy denim and boots. Pot leaves and Pumas. Long, heavy
text: key chains. Vintage 1994 whiteboy faux-gansta. They do,
dialog: however, look big and mean next to our boys.
text: The early sixties style sweater jackets and blazers over
text: button down shirts and tapered slacks don't quite have the
text: same fear factor, but the boys do look classy.
text: The word "bitch" is growled out by the two of them a half
dialog: dozen more times until...
text: Sue pulls a PISTOL out of his belt.
text: Everyone is SCARED. Especially the swingers.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Now what, bitch? Now who's the bitch,

speaker_heading: BALD GUY
dialog: Hey, man. I'm the bitch. I'm your
dialog: bitch, okay? We're just gonna leave.
dialog: Okay? I'm the bitch. I'm such a bitch,

text: They jump in the car and SPEED AWAY.
text: Sue belts the gun and stands tall like Clint.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What the fuck..?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in
dialog: the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You asshole.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You dick.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What'd you want me to do? Back down? He

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Fuck rep, I've got a callback tomorrow.
text: Charles leaves.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Yeah, I gotta be up early tomorrow.

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: What? In case someone steps to you,
dialog: Snoop Dogg?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Hey, man, you're not from here. You
dialog: don't know how it is. I grew up in

speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... Anaheim...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... Whatever. Things are different here.
dialog: It's not like New York, Mikey.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble.
dialog: It's not like you like in Compton where
text: bullets are whizzing by your head every
dialog: day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway.
dialog: In New York the trouble finds you. Out
dialog: here you gotta go look for it...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... People get carjacked...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... Oh, who would jack your fuckin K-car?
dialog: He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Listen. Just because I was the only one
dialog: with the balls to stand up to them...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: ... Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was
dialog: gonna do anything...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You live in such a fantasy world...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What about you, Mikey? At least I got
dialog: balls. You're always whining about some
dialog: bitch who dumped you a year ago...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: ... It was six months, and she didn't
dialog: dump...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: ... Whatever. You're like a whining
dialog: little woman. Big deal. You got a
dialog: fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it

speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: SUE

speaker_heading: TRENT

text: He pulls a pepperoni and a loaf of seminola out of the bag.
text: He hands Mike a pint of orange juice.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Thanks, man.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: No problem, buddy. You eat anything

speaker_heading: ROB

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No. Just O.J.

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: I had no idea...
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun
dialog: story. You should hear the way I tell to

speaker_heading: ROB

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What's the point?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: It's been two days. You should call that

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I think I'm gonna move Back East.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Well, that's dumb.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What's dumb about it?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Well, you're doing so well...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How am I doing well? I host an open mike
dialog: and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a
dialog: movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an
dialog: agency that specializes in fuckin
dialog: magicians. How good am I doing?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: At least you didn't get turned down for
dialog: Goofy...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They turned you down?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: They went for someone with more theme
dialog: park experience. I woulda killed for
dialog: that job.
text: Mike lets it sink in.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: See, it's all how you look at it. If
dialog: your life sucks, then mine is God awful.
dialog: I mean, I moved out here partially
dialog: because I saw how well you were doing.
dialog: You got in the union, you got an agent.
dialog: I thought if you could make it, maybe I
dialog: could too...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I didn't make it...
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: That's your problem, man. You can't see
dialog: what you've got, only what you've lost.
dialog: Those guys are right. You are "money".
text: Mike smiles, then...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (starting to cry)
dialog: Then why won't she call...?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Because you left, man. She's got her own
dialog: world to deal with in New York. She was
dialog: a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta
dialog: move on. You gotta let go of the past.
dialog: The future is so beautiful. Every day is
dialog: so sunny out here. It's like Manifest
dialog: Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's
dialog: past is prologue. That which does not
dialog: kill us makes us stronger. All that
dialog: shit. You'll get over it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How did you get over it? I mean how long
dialog: 'til it stopped hurting?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Sometimes is still hurts. You know how
dialog: it is, man. I mean, each day you think
dialog: about it less and less. And then one day
dialog: you wake up and you don't think of it at
dialog: all, and you almost miss that feeling.
dialog: It's kinda weird. You miss the pain
dialog: because it was part of your life for so
dialog: long. And the, boom, something reminds
dialog: you of her, and you just smile that
text: bittersweet smile.
text: We see that Mike has been GNAWING AWAY at Rob's pepperoni and
text: semolina as he listens intently.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You miss the pain?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: ... for the same reason you miss her.
dialog: You lived with it so long.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wow.
dialog: (finishing the loaf)
dialog: You wanna grab a bite?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Sure.
text: He helps Mike up.

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Uh, if the guy wants to.
speaker_heading: BRUNETTE
dialog: You don't think the guy would find me
dialog: attractive enough to dance with?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would
dialog: find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe
dialog: he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he
dialog: likes to do is just stand around and
dialog: drink and smoke and look cool with his
dialog: buddies who don't dance either...
speaker_heading: BRUNETTE
dialog: Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good
dialog: dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's
dialog: what he's afraid of.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (smirk)
dialog: No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe
dialog: she shouldn't be such a smug little shit
dialog: because she'd be surprised at what a good

dialog: to...
speaker_heading: BRUNETTE
dialog: Mike...
text: She gets up. She's beautiful. She is beautiful.
speaker_heading: BRUNETTE
dialog: ... Will you dance with me?
text: She's in great shape, and look how classy her vintage dress
dialog: looks. A vision from the forties. She's too good for this

dialog: but...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sure I will.
text: He awkwardly leads her to the unusually empty dance floor.
text: They START TO DANCE. It's a slow song and they boringly rock

dialog: her touch.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: SUE
text: It is on.
speaker_heading: TRENT

speaker_heading: BACK TO:
text: The couple's dance is cut short as there were only a few bars
text: left of the slow ballad. Mike smiles politely in relief and
text: begins to lead Lorraine off the floor.
text: She pulls him back. He's not getting off that easy. She
text: wants a whole song. He politely holds her, poised for
text: another slow number. They're alone on the floor.
text: Much to Mike's dismay, the song begins with a DRIVING TOM TOM
text: SOLO. This cues every hep cat in the Derby that the big
text: one's coming. They all flood the floor for the last dance of
dialog: the night.
text: Mike pleadingly shakes his head at Lorraine. It's too fast.
text: Her eyes narrow as her grip tightens. No sympathy here.
text: The band breaks into the full-tilt swing number and the dance
text: floor writhes around them.
text: They stand motionless for what seems like an eternity.
dialog: Gut check. Fuck it. Sink or swim.
text: Mike grabs her like a man grabs a woman. It's just a simple
text: six-count swing step, but they're in perfect harmony.
text: Mike and Lorraine look into each others eyes. It's on, baby.
text: As Mike's courage grows, the moves start to flow. A spin at
text: first. Then a double twirl. It's not long before he's
text: throwing her through combinations that stand out even among
dialog: the pros.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Trent and Sue, mouths agape.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
text: Mike is whipping her smoothly through violent-looking
dialog: combinations without a trace of hesitation, and, boy, can she
dialog: follow.
text: The set ends with a flourishing crescendo. They're frozen in
text: a final dip, panting through a glaze of clean sweat.
text: Mike and Lorraine smile and look into each other's eyes. The
text: smile slowly disappears. Will they kiss?
dialog: They're close.
dialog: Really close.
text: Lips almost touching.
text: Mike tries to muster-up the courage, but it's been so long.
text: He can't do it. He lets her up.
text: The floor clears. Exhausted dancers push past them. Forget
text: it. The moment's gone.

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Didn't you tell me to be patient with my

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: LORRAINE

dialog: Can I have one of these?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why, you like the duck with the cigar?

speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from

speaker_heading: MIKE
