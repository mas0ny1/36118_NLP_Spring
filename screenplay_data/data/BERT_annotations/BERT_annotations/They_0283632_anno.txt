speaker_heading: DAY
dialog: Tiny golden
text: wheels and gears turning lazily upon metal rods. Mechanical pieces.
dialog: Small and
text: intricate. Glittering in the sunlight.
speaker_heading: REVEAL
dialog: The gears are
text: turning within an ANTIQUE DESK CLOCK sitting on a book shelf, a small
dialog: pendulum
text: swinging back and forth behind the glass housing.
dialog: The room is
text: barren except for a pair of open suitcases and a bed that's been
dialog: stripped.
text: Sitting on the mattress is ...
speaker_heading: JULIA LEVIN
dialog: Smart and
text: clever. Dressed in a graduation gown and staring out the window. She
dialog: seems to be
text: lost in thought, immobile, until the bedroom door swings open and...
speaker_heading: CONNOR LEVIN,
text: aged seventeen and wearing a suit and tie, steps inside.
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: Dad says we
dialog: gotta get moving. We're late.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I'm getting
dialog: ready.
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: You're sitting
text: on the bed.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: Thanks for
dialog: clearing that up. I'll be right down.
dialog: He steps
dialog: out.
dialog: Julia takes a
text: framed picture out of her suitcase -- a candid shot of herself
dialog: standing with her
text: MOTHER, forties, a healthy and vibrant woman.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: Sure do miss
dialog: you.
text: Above her, a
text: CEILING FAN rotates. Creating a soft HUMMING.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTWOOD -
scene_heading: APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Julia walks out
text: of the building where her father, GUY LEVIN, an older man with a kind
dialog: face,
text: waits. Connor is checking his reflection in the car window, adjusting
dialog: his tie,
text: fussing with his hair.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: You ready?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: All set. I
dialog: packed up everything.
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: Oh, except
dialog: Mom's clock -- I think there's something wrong with it. It's not
dialog: telling the
dialog: right time.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I'll get it
dialog: fixed. Probably just needs a few new parts.
text: Guy smiles at
text: Julia for a moment. Very warmly.
speaker_heading: GUY (cont'd)
dialog: You look just
dialog: like your mother.
dialog: Julia is
text: momentarily uncomfortable. But she recovers,
dialog: father on the
dialog: cheek.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: We'll be
dialog: late.
scene_heading: EXT. UNIVERSITY
scene_heading: OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES - CAMPUS - DAY
text: smiles and kisses her
dialog: Students
text: dressed in graduation caps and gowns are gathered on the campus
dialog: grounds.
dialog: Julia stands by
text: herself, taking pictures with a professional Nikon camera. She focuses
dialog: the
dialog: camera upon ...
speaker_heading: TERRY ALBA, 22,
text: beautiful and sexy. Very particular and demanding. She smiles
dialog: perfectly as Julia
text: snaps the picture. But her boyfriend, SAM BURNSIDE, cute and
dialog: mischievous,
text: sporting pink hair and loud clothes, makes a face.
dialog: Winding her
text: film, Julia searches a moment, then smiles. Raising her camera lens,
dialog: she snaps a
dialog: picture of ...
speaker_heading: PAUL LOOMIS
dialog: Early twenties.
text: Dark hair. Strapping and perfectly handsome. He wears a blue and gold
dialog: striped
text: tie with his starched white shirt and graduation gown.
text: He kisses her.
dialog: Passionate and gentle.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You packed
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Ready to move
dialog: in. I'll be storing some of the stuff you've already got. Television.
dialog: CD player.
dialog: Microwave.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (suggestively)
dialog: Bed.
text: Julia smiles at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Bed.
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: Med School
dialog: doesn't start until August. At least not for the freshmen, so we've
dialog: got plenty
dialog: of time to see Europe, take the car trip up north ...
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I hope it won't
dialog: be a drag. There's a lot of stuff to move out of my mother's cabin.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Our friends
dialog: will be there. It'll be fun.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I hope so.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Tense.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Would it help
dialog: if I massaged your breasts?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Because it
dialog: would help me.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (stifling
dialog: laughter)
dialog: Maybe
dialog: later.
dialog: The students
text: start forming into lines.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: Hey, I saw your
dialog: Mom and kid sister. Where's your Dad?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: He's not
dialog: coming.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: But it's your
dialog: graduation.
dialog: Paul shrugs
text: again. A brief sting of hurt on his face.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wasn't a good
dialog: enough reason in High School either.
dialog: Paul looks
dialog: away. Julia knows how painful this is and
dialog: to diminish
dialog: it.
dialog: Julia smiles
text: and runs her finger across his tie knot.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I like your
text: tie. UCLA colors.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: won't insult him by trying
dialog: School spirit.
dialog: I am a Bruin.
dialog: The lines start
text: moving towards the stadium. Hundreds of CHEERS rise up from the
dialog: graduating
dialog: students.
text: As she walks, a
text: sound draws Julia's attention. Standing on the lawn is a SMALL BOY, no
dialog: more than
text: four years-old, SOBBING and clinging to his mother's legs.
dialog: Julia stops
text: walking as she gazes at the child. The line comes to a halt behind
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: Julia. We can't
dialog: graduate unless you move.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: She stalks
text: walking again. Paul puts his arms around her.
scene_heading: EXT. SAM'S
scene_heading: HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY
dialog: A big,

scene_heading: EXT. SAM'S
scene_heading: HOUSE - BACK PORCH - DAY
dialog: Sitting between
text: a pair of open french doors is "the gang" consisting of Julia and Paul
dialog: and Terry
text: and Sam. They throw around conversation, ignoring the party.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It's secluded?
dialog: Nobody said anything to me about the cabin being secluded.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I said it was a
dialog: cabin in the woods. I thought seclusion was a given.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'm no good out
dialog: in the woods. You know what lives in the woods? Animals that sting.
dialog: Animals that
dialog: bite.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So avoid the
dialog: animals.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I really
dialog: appreciate you guys helping me. I couldn't move everything alone.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey, it's our
dialog: last chance to be together. Terry and I are excited.
dialog: (turns)
dialog: Aren't we,
dialog: Ter?
dialog: She's not
dialog: excited.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Can I bring my
dialog: cotton bedsheets to the cabin? If I try to sleep in anything but
dialog: cotton, I get
dialog: hives.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Whatever makes
dialog: you happy.
dialog: Sam grabs a
text: large drawing pad from the steps. He opens it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Speaking of
dialog: which, I've got your graduation gift. As specified.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Let's see.
text: Sam holds up a
text: sketch of Clark Kent changing to Superman.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Like it?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: It's great.
dialog: Thanks Sam.
dialog: Paul checks out
text: the drawing. His nose crinkles.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Superman? Why'd
dialog: you want a drawing of Superman?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: He's very
dialog: attractive.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (staring)
dialog: You're
dialog: kidding.
speaker_heading: JULIA
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: He's not even
dialog: real.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I think most
dialog: women tend to wonder if Superman is super in every way.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You see. There
dialog: goes your argument.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: But Spiderman
dialog: has a nice ass.
dialog: Off everyone's
speaker_heading: LOOK --
speaker_heading: TERRY (cont'd)
dialog: What?
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S
scene_heading: HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: Julia finishes

dialog: Julia opens
dialog: the bathroom door ...
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S
scene_heading: HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: ++. and
text: freezes. Standing within an open bedroom is ...
speaker_heading: A BLOND
speaker_heading: STUDENT.
dialog: Another college
text: graduate. Tan and attractive. Dressed exactly like Paul -- identical
dialog: white
text: shirt, gold and blue striped tie. He pulls off his tie and unbuttons
dialog: his
dialog: shirt.
dialog: Julia doesn't
dialog: move.
dialog: The student
text: peels off his shirt. Her eyes are drawn to a Superman
dialog: tattooed on
text: his shoulder.
dialog: The student
dialog: 
dialog: insignia
text: catches sight of Julia in the hallway. Her face turns bright red
dialog: immediately.
text: She starts to laugh.
text: He smiles at
text: her. A bit flattered. Flirting.
speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: Changing into
dialog: something more formal.
text: He holds up a
text: pair of ripped jeans.
dialog: Julia backs
text: down the hallway. Still laughing. Embarrassed.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I'm sorry. I
dialog: was just using the ...
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Really. I'm
dialog: sorry.
speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: I'll forgive
dialog: you this once.
dialog: She quickly
dialog: leaves.
dialog: The blond
text: student watches her go. A grin on his face.
scene_heading: EXT. SAM'S
scene_heading: HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
text: Julia walks out
text: the back door. Stifling her laughter.
dialog: Paul is talking
text: with Guy on the lawn. Julia SNAPS a picture of them together, winds
dialog: her film,
dialog: and notices ...
speaker_heading: A LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Sweet and
text: innocent. Sitting on a bench. Motionless.
dialog: Julia walks
text: towards her. The little girl is staring across the lawn at a pool
dialog: shed.
text: Transfixed. A group of children are playing on the grass in front of
dialog: it.
dialog: The girl
text: becomes aware of Julia's presence and turns around.
speaker_heading: JULIA
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You sitting
dialog: here all by yourself?
dialog: The girl slowly
dialog: nods "Yes."
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: Don't you want
dialog: to play with the other kids?
dialog: The girls
dialog: shakes her head "No."
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: Want me to
dialog: leave you alone?
dialog: The girl shakes
dialog: her head "No."
dialog: More
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: Want to mix
dialog: this up and ask me something?
dialog: The little girl
text: notices the camera.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Are you taking
dialog: pictures for Sam's family?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: No, I'm just
dialog: (then)
dialog: I'm a friend of
dialog: Sam's. But I'm also a photographer.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Will you take a
dialog: picture of me?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: So you won't
dialog: forget me.
dialog: I take pictures.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Why would I
dialog: forget you?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Because they're
dialog: coming for me.
text: A long beat.
text: Julia sits next to her.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Who is?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: The
dialog: monsters.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What
dialog: monsters?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: There. Behind
dialog: the door.
dialog: The girl points
text: towards the pool shed. The rusted door of the shed is slightly open.
dialog: Just a
dialog: crack.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Those other
dialog: kids don't look too scared.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: They should
dialog: be.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (playing
dialog: along)
dialog: So how come
dialog: only you can see them?
speaker_heading: THE GIRL LEANS
text: FORWARD AND SPEAKS IN A HUSHED WHISPER.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Because I know
dialog: they're real. I used to have a little brother, but they came and got
dialog: him.
dialog: 
dialog: Now my parents say I never had a brother before.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Soon ... my
dialog: parents won't remember me either.
dialog: Something about
text: the girl's tone of voice is unnerving. As if she's resigned herself to
dialog: this.
dialog: A slight wind
text: HISSES through the trees. The girl rises.
speaker_heading: GIRL (cont'd)
dialog: I gotta go.
dialog: They know I'm talking about them.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Wait a
dialog: second.
speaker_heading: Julia SNAPS a
dialog: picture of the girl.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: Feel
dialog: better?
dialog: The girl stares
dialog: at her.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Are you scared
dialog: of monsters?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I am.
dialog: The girl turns
text: and runs across the lawn.
dialog: Julia is left
text: sitting on the bench. She glances over at the pool shed again. Raises
dialog: her camera
text: and focuses on the door which is still cracked open.
dialog: She snaps the
dialog: picture.
speaker_heading: CLICK!
scene_heading: INT. PAUL'S
scene_heading: APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: Julia and Paul
text: are romantically entangled as they enter the apartment. A little
dialog: drunk. Kissing
text: and frolicking. She strips off his jacket and tie. Paul abruptly
dialog: stops.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wait a minute
dialog: (grabbing
dialog: both sides of his shirt)
dialog: This is a job
dialog: for ...
text: Paul rips his
text: shirt wide open. Buttons popping everywhere. They both start laughing.
dialog: Joining
text: together, he guides her towards the bathroom.
dialog: The wind gently
text: HISSES on the balcony. Windchimes spinning.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM -
speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: A cloud of hot
text: steam. The soothing rush of warm water running over tanned and naked
dialog: skin.
dialog: Julia stands
text: underneath the shower, her body relaxing into Paul's chest, his
dialog: muscular arms
text: encircling her body, his lips buried in her neck and shoulders. Her
dialog: eyes are
text: shut. Her expression is calm.
speaker_heading: INTERCUT -
speaker_heading: BLOND STUDENT
dialog: Standing in the
text: guest bedroom at Sam's house. Young and muscular. Bathed in sunlight.
dialog: The tattoo
text: on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: BACK TO
speaker_heading: JULIA
text: Her eyes still
text: pressed closed. Smiling a little.
dialog: Water continues
text: rushing from the shower head, creating a HISS that eventually becomes
speaker_heading: THE ROAR
text: OF THE OCEAN.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC
scene_heading: COAST HIGHWAY - DUSK
dialog: The setting sun
text: blushes crimson across the rolling waves of the Pacific. Streaking
dialog: along the
text: highway is a RANGE ROVER, packed with luggage, headlights on.
scene_heading: INT. RANGE
speaker_heading: ROVER - DUSK
dialog: Paul sits
text: behind the wheel. He's bopping and RAPPING with Sam to HIP-HOP that
speaker_heading: BLARES from
text: the speakers. Very energized.
text: Julia sits on
text: the passenger side, leaning against the window, trying to shut out the
dialog: music.
text: Terry looks just as miserable. Finally, Julia turns off the radio.
text: A silent beat.
text: The guys catch their girlfriends' expressions.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: Terry leans
text: forward between the seats.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: So the cabin
dialog: has electricity, right? And plumbing? Everything we need?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: So it has
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: It has
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: I hear a shoe about to drop.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Except a
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: BAM! There it
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (scandalized)
dialog: I need a phone.
dialog: It's like family to me. Mom, Dad, my brother .... phone.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: So you're
dialog: roughing it.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: The last time I
dialog: tried to rough it, I was in therapy for a year. Why didn't your mother
dialog: have a
dialog: phone?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I guess she
dialog: wanted to be left alone.
dialog: At least until
dialog: she got sick.
dialog: Paul looks to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This won't be
dialog: too hard on you, will it?
dialog: Staying at her
dialog: place?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: It's okay. I'm
dialog: enjoying this.
text: Julia smiles at
text: him. Paul smiles back.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Good.
dialog: He switches the
text: radio back on and continues RAPPING with Sam. Julia and Terry both
dialog: stare
text: straight ahead, ears pounding. This is turning into a LONG trip.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST
speaker_heading: ROAD - NIGHT
dialog: Paul's Range
text: Rover makes its way down a long, winding road. The Rover's headlights
dialog: illuminate
text: the woods lining the road on both sides.
scene_heading: INT. RANGE
speaker_heading: ROVER - NIGHT
dialog: The inside of
text: the Range Rover is dark. Only the faint glow from the dashboard lights
dialog: provides
text: any ambient illumination. Sam and Terry are snuggled together in the
dialog: back seat.
text: Everything is quiet.
dialog: Julia is
text: thinking. Finally, she breaks the silence.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Do you believe
dialog: in monsters?
text: A beat.
text: Everyone else in the car trades looks.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We've been in
dialog: the car too long.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I'm just
dialog: asking.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Like what? The
dialog: Boogeyman?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: The Boogeyman.
text: The thing under the bed. The monster hiding in the closet.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What made you
dialog: think of that?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: A little girl
text: at Sam's house. She was convinced there was a monster trying to get
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You're saying
dialog: you believe her?
dialog: Julia is
text: suddenly on the spot. She backtracks.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Of course I
dialog: don't. There are no monsters. Not really.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sure there are.
dialog: Ted Bundy. Son of Sam.
dialog: Ed Gein.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Who was Ed
dialog: Gein?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He was a mass
dialog: murderer. This old hermit who'd kill people and take the parts he
dialog: wanted. Heads.
dialog: Livers. Intestines. Sex organs.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Why did he use
dialog: the parts for?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Everything. The
text: police found a skull that was used for a soup bowl. Faces were stuffed
dialog: and
text: mounted like hunting trophies on the wall. Bones were used for
dialog: furniture.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: He also wore
dialog: their skin. Like clothes.
text: Terry recoils
text: into her seat. Grossed out.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Sorry I
dialog: asked.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You wanted
text: proof. There it is.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: But it's not
text: like he's a monster under the bed.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: So why are kids
dialog: afraid of that?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Because they
dialog: live in a completely different world than we do.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Think about it.
dialog: Why do kids pick up on things that we can't? ... Bumps in the night?
text: footsteps in the hallway? ... A thumping inside their closet?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Overactive
dialog: imagination.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Wrong. Perfect
dialog: awareness.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Kids have a
text: perfect awareness of everything around them. Every sound. Every
dialog: shadow.
dialog: Everything gets
dialog: quiet.
speaker_heading: SAM (cont'd)
dialog: The Boogeyman
dialog: could be real. So could monsters. Just because you've never seen them
dialog: doesn't
dialog: mean they aren't there.
dialog: Silence. The
text: car engine purrs softly. This is starting to make sense. And it's
text: spooky.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: All right. I'm
dialog: creeped out. But my bullshit alarm is going off.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You just can't
dialog: handle it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Right. Because
dialog: it's bullshit.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Serial killers
dialog: aside, my take on this subject is very simple. If I don't
dialog: picture of it
dialog: -- it's not real.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Okay, is this
dialog: conversation like a radio station? Can we just change the
dialog: Because
dialog: personally, I'd like to get to sleep tonight.
dialog: Terry has just
dialog: finished saying these words, when --
text: AN ANIMAL RUNS OUT OF THE WOODS INTO THE
text: MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. A BLACK SHAPE IN THE HEADLIGHTS. EYES
speaker_heading: THE
speaker_heading: DARK.
dialog: have a
dialog: channel?
speaker_heading: FLASHING IN
speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: JESUS
speaker_heading: CHRIST!
speaker_heading: Paul SLAMS on
text: the brakes. Too late.
text: WHAM! THE RANGE ROVER SMASHES INTO IT,
text: throwing the shape into a ditch at the side of the road.
dialog: The Range Rover
text: swerves and comes to a SQUEALING HALT.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE
speaker_heading: ROVER
dialog: Everyone
text: catches their breath. A moment of dead silence.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: Everyone
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: We're fine.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What was
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I think it was
dialog: a dog.
dialog: Julia unlocks
dialog: her door.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: We'd better
dialog: check the car.
text: She steps out
text: of the Rover. The others follow.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST
speaker_heading: ROAD - NIGHT
dialog: The hazard
text: lights are switched on. Paul walks around to the front of the Rover.
dialog: The bumper is
dialog: dented.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Look at that.
dialog: There's a couple thousand dollars out of my wallet.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You can
dialog: probably get someone to pop it back.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sure. For a
dialog: couple hundred dollars.
text: Sam looks down
text: the road. He can barely make out a large form resting lifeless in the
dialog: ditch.
dialog: He starts
text: walking towards it.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I'm sorry about
dialog: your car, Paul ...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (begrudging)
dialog: Yeah, well.
dialog: Shit happens.
dialog: The
text: conversation becomes distant as Sam walks slowly up the road, moving
dialog: past the
text: yellow flashing HAZARD LIGHTS which CLICK rhythmically ... click,
dialog: click, click
dialog: Sam approaches
text: the ditch. Darkness is all around.
dialog: wee. Click ...
dialog: click ... click ...
text: He kneels down
text: alongside the body of the animal. Very little is visible of the corpse
dialog: except
text: for its dark, mangled form sprawled across the dirt.
text: Sam picks up a
text: stick and pokes at the body. Nothing happens.
text: He pokes at the
dialog: corpse again.
dialog: The hind legs
text: of the corpse suddenly twitch. A reflex action. Sam leaps back. The
dialog: life nearly
text: scared out of him.
dialog: A flap of
text: hairless skin slides away from one of the animal's hind legs. Sam
dialog: leans forward
text: to get a better look, becoming simultaneously repulsed and fascinated.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey guys!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Take a look at
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Is ita
dialog: dog?
text: Sam glances at
text: the dead corpse and back to his friends again. He looks shaken.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't
dialog: know.
dialog: The rest of the
text: group moves down the road. A weird unease has started to settle in.
dialog: Paul and Julia
text: kneel down in front of the corpse. It's almost unrecognizable. The
dialog: darkness
text: smothering the road keeps them from getting a handle on any of the
dialog: body's
dialog: features.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It looks like a
dialog: dog to me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Did you see the
dialog: leg?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What about
dialog: it?
dialog: Sam takes the
text: stick and gently pushes away the flap of torn skin for a better look.
dialog: The group
text: leans forward.
text: A deep bleeding
text: wound has been exposed. Through the torn flesh and blood pumping over
dialog: charcoal
text: skin, the group can see bones flashing into the moonlight. But
dialog: intermingled with
dialog: the animal's skeleton are ...
speaker_heading: PIECES OF METAL
text: Glittering and
text: clean. A series of connected stainless steel threads and pallid bone
dialog: that have
dialog: grown together.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ever seen
dialog: anything like that?
speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: PAUL

dialog: The camera

text: Twisted metal.
text: Skin. Appendages. Madness.
dialog: Both of the
text: young men stand frozen, thunderstruck, staring down at the misshapen

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's wrong.
dialog: That's all wrong.

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's not a

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: PAUL

dialog: Julia and Paul

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What the hell
dialog: is it?!
dialog: Paul tosses the

speaker_heading: A soft THUMPING

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Get in the

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I want to know

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Will you shut

dialog: Paul fishes out
text: the car keys from his jacket pocket. He starts the ignition. The
speaker_heading: engine ROARS to

speaker_heading: JULIA
text: A heavy THUMP.
text: Right outside the back window. Sam and Terry instinctively look
text: towards the rear

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: There's

speaker_heading: JULIA

dialog: Finally ...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I want to get

dialog: Everyone's face

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You do that.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Nothing about

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: There were

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Fine. Go back

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: We've already

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let's get a few

speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: The group

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Your call.
dialog: Julia stares
text: back at all of them. A moment.
speaker_heading: A small CHILD
text: begins CRYING and SCREAMING in the restaurant. Julia flinches at the
dialog: unexpected
text: sound, glancing over at the child's parents as they quiet him down.
text: She rises from

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I have to use

scene_heading: RESTAURANT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: Large and

text: behind her.
text: She moves to the mirror, washes her hands, and retrieves a brush from
dialog: her
dialog: purse.
speaker_heading: Water DRIPS
text: from one of the leaky pipes in the bathroom while the fluorescent bulb
dialog: over the
text: mirror CRACKLES softly. Julia is about to brush her hair, but
dialog: something unnerves
text: her. She cocks her head slightly. A feeling.
dialog: She turns
text: around and checks out the bathroom. The doors to the stalls are all
dialog: closed shut.
text: Empty and quiet.
dialog: She starts
text: brushing her hair. A few moments pass. Then, she stops and listens to
dialog: the water
text: DRIPPING from the pipe. Julia turns back around and looks at the
dialog: bathroom.
dialog: One of the
text: stall doors all the way at the end is now slightly open. Not much.
dialog: Just enough
text: to reveal a patch of darkness and gloom within.
dialog: The sound of
text: water dripping abruptly stops. Silence follows.
dialog: Julia looks

speaker_heading: The CHILD

dialog: she'd walk

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How much

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Thirty seconds.
text: It's coming out.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I still think

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm not loading

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What is it?
dialog: What does it look like?
dialog: The photograph

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Damn .
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What happened
dialog: to the picture?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Out of

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you
text: mean it's out of focus? I took the picture. The flash went off.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Sam, this is a

dialog: A quiet moment
text: as they stare at the picture.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, so much
dialog: for that.
text: Sam looks at

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I can't get
dialog: over it. That thing looked wrong. Completely wrong.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Of course it

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What about the

text: Sam turns back
dialog: to Julia --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'll pay you to

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You don't have
dialog: to pay me. Take the car.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The Rover's a
dialog: shift. I can only drive an automatic.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Ask Paul.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He's out
dialog: running. Besides, you heard him last night. He'd never do it.
text: Julia stares at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: It's a dead
dialog: animal.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So come with
dialog: me. You take the pictures this time. If it's just a dead animal, then
dialog: you're
dialog: right and I'm wrong. But if it's not, we've got a picture of it.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: A picture of
dialog: what?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A monster.
dialog: A set of

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is it?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I think so. You
text: can see the way the road turns sharply to the left. The rest of the
dialog: drive was
dialog: straight.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You've got
dialog: film, right?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: A new roll. You
dialog: can have all the pictures you want.
dialog: Julia and Sam
text: start searching the ditch. Feet crunching in the dirt. Moving away

speaker_heading: A soft THUMP
text: echoes from somewhere in the woods. A place just beyond the wall of

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Last night on

dialog: have the same feeling?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What
dialog: feeling?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That we were
text: being chased.
dialog: Julia doesn't
dialog: say anything.
dialog: She stops cold
text: in her tracks. Just ahead of her, resting motionless in the ditch, is
text: A BODY ...
text: Swathed in dark
text: fur, twisted at a pathetic angle, huge gashes in its side. The corpse
text: of a DOBERMAN PINSCHER. Flies are BUZZING
text: and swarming over the dog's open wounds.
dialog: Julia and Sam
text: move towards the dog's lifeless form.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: There's your

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I don't see any

dialog: you?

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's not what
dialog: I saw.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON THE

dialog: looks

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Good. She's

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I feel sorry

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Me too. But
dialog: that doesn't mean I want to get screamed at.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: People are

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She's doing a

speaker_heading: PAUL

dialog: overreacting.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Would you look
dialog: at it again?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I already did.
dialog: And I still don't see anything.
dialog: Paul gets into
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: That little
text: girl said there was a monster in the shed.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (kisses
dialog: her)
dialog: It was probably
dialog: another dog. Good night.
text: He switches off
text: the light. Paul turns over and goes to sleep.
dialog: Julia sits for
text: a moment in the dark. Alone with her thoughts. She looks over at the
dialog: walk-in
text: closet across the room.
dialog: The closet door
text: is slightly open. Just a crack. Not enough to provide any clear view
dialog: of what
dialog: lies within, but just enough for something -- monsters included -- to
dialog: peek
dialog: out.
text: Julia stares at
text: the closet. Spooked. She knows better, but it's dark and her primal
dialog: fears are
dialog: taking control.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (to
dialog: herself)
dialog: Stupid.
dialog: She gets out of
text: bed and tiptoes to the closet, shutting the door. Then she gets back
dialog: into bed.
text: Smiling to herself, she goes to sleep.

scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
speaker_heading: BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: The clock on
text: the night table reads 3:15 AM. Julia turns over in her sleep and stirs
dialog: awake.
text: She groggily looks over towards the closet. Julia practically sits up
dialog: in
dialog: bed.
text: THE CLOSET DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.
dialog: A childhood
text: nightmare come to life. Julia's breathing quickens. She reaches
dialog: towards the
text: other side of the bed.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: whisper)
dialog: Paul?
dialog: Her hand finds
text: nothing but sheets and empty space. There's nobody there. She quickly
dialog: turns to
text: locate her boyfriend. But he's gone.
dialog: She tries to
text: switch on the light. CLICK.
dialog: The light stays
text: off. She tries again. CLICK.
dialog: Nothing
dialog: happens.
text: Then, she hears
text: it. A faint sound. Almost like a SHUFFLING. The sound of something
text: dragging itself lightly across the floor to the edge of the bed.
dialog: Julia's throat
text: has gone dry. Carefully, she creeps towards Paul's side of the bed and
dialog: checks
dialog: the floor.
dialog: There is
text: nothing in sight. The only sign of movement are the shadows from the
dialog: trees
dialog: outside.
dialog: There is only
text: one place left to look. Julia cautiously steps down to the floor.
dialog: Sinking down
text: on her knees, she gently lifts up the dust ruffle and looks into the
dialog: inky
text: darkness underneath the bed. The space is empty.
dialog: Julia drops the
text: dust ruffle and sits up, GASPING.
speaker_heading: A BLACK SHAPE
text: IS STANDING BEHIND HER.
dialog: Then, a
text: familiar voice comes from it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey ... it's
dialog: just me.
dialog: Paul switches
text: on the light. He's wearing a UCLA sweatshirt.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: The light
dialog: wouldn't turn on.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Works now.
dialog: Julia catches
text: her breath. The fear finally draining from her.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Where were
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I was cold so I
text: got a sweater from the closet.
dialog: you looking
dialog: under the bed?
dialog: Julia isn't
dialog: quite sure how to answer.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I thought there
dialog: was something in the room.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Something? Like
dialog: what?
scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: SHRRRIIIIPPP.
dialog: And I went to
text: She's embarrassed.
text: Packing tape is pulled back froma roll.
dialog: the bathroom. Why were
dialog: Julia finishes
text: taping up a cardboard box. Terry is packing some
dialog: box of her
dialog: own.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You thought there was a monster in the room? And
dialog: you admitted it?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I didn't know
dialog: what else to say.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Advice. When
dialog: you don't know what else to say, you lie.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: But I really
dialog: did hear something.

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You're worse

dialog: Julia looks
text: towards the front door.
text: Sam is sitting
text: on the porch steps, sketching on his pad, oblivious to everything
dialog: around
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: He's in his own
dialog: world, isn't he?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That's an
dialog: understatement. I have a sinking feeling that sex is out of the
dialog: question for
dialog: this trip.
dialog: This sparks
text: something in Julia. She hesitates, looking through an open doorway
dialog: where Paul
text: can be seen packing some clothes. Julia speaks to Terry in confidence.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Do you
dialog: fantasize about other people?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: If I haven't
dialog: yet, I probably will by the time we're ready to leave.
dialog: Hesitant
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I've been
text: fantasizing about a guy.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Anyone we

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Blond. Good

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'd like to
dialog: know that.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: He has a

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TERRY
speaker_heading: JULIA
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: When did this
dialog: start?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Sam's party. I
text: walked out of the bathroom and he was changing out of his suit. He
dialog: lost his tie,
dialog: his shirt ... and then he spotted me.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What did you
dialog: say? Keep going?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I got out of
dialog: there. But I've been fantasizing about him ever since.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Fuck yeah.
dialog: Power to the people.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: But Paul is the
dialog: perfect boyfriend. Top to bottom. He's gorgeous. He's smart. He's
dialog: gonna be a
dialog: doctor.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: He never gets
dialog: upset about anything ...
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What the hell
dialog: is wrong with me?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It's just a
dialog: fantasy.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Yeah, but when
dialog: I made love to Paul on grad night ... I thought of him.
dialog: Terry
dialog: stares.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I know. Don't
dialog: tell Paul about this. I'd rather not test the whole "he never gets
dialog: upset about
dialog: anything" part.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Are you
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I don't know. I
dialog: think I'm flipping out. Seeing things in pictures. Thinking that
dialog: there's a
dialog: monster in my closet.
speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Your closet was

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Having to wash

text: She walks out.

scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
speaker_heading: HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: Julia is
dialog: closet wide open and I'm not upset
dialog: That upsets me.
text: left alone with her own puzzled
text: walking down the hallway. She happens to pass the bathroom door which
dialog: is
text: slightly open.
speaker_heading: JULIA'S POV
dialog: Within the
text: bathroom. The BLOND STUDENT is toweling off. Completely naked. The
dialog: tattoo
text: plainly visible on his shoulder. His eyes lock on hers.
speaker_heading: Julia REACTS,
text: and runs straight into Paul. She JUMPS.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Jesus. You
dialog: scared me.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: It's okay. I
dialog: wasn't looking.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm going for a
dialog: run.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Okay. See you
dialog: when you get back.
dialog: (remembers)
dialog: Oh, Paul? Don't
dialog: leave the closet door open anymore, all right?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: The closet.
dialog: Last night. You left it open.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I closed it
dialog: after I got my sweatshirt.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Did not.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Serious. I
dialog: thought you opened it.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Wasn't me.
dialog: A moment.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well damn,
dialog: Julia. Your monster isn't just noisy, he's also inconsiderate.
text: He kisses her
text: on the cheek and takes off. Julia stands alone in the empty hallway, a
dialog: chill
text: running down her spine.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
speaker_heading: CLOSET - DAY
text: The door slowly
text: creaks open. Julia stands in the doorway, surveying the closet -- a
dialog: cluttered
text: and claustrophobic space despite its size. Clothes draped on hangars.
dialog: Cardboard
text: boxes stacked on shelves. Shadows.
dialog: Julia moves
text: inside and pulls a string hanging from a light bulb which acts as a
dialog: switch.
text: Tick-tick. The bulb stays dark. She tries again.
dialog: Tick-tick.
text: The light still
dialog: won't come on.
dialog: Julia carefully
text: looks through some of the clothes. Nothing. She kneels down and checks
dialog: the
dialog: floor.
text: A long CREAKING
text: behind her. The natural light fades.
dialog: Julia looks
text: over her shoulder, a bit skittish, as the closet door eases back
dialog: towards the
text: doorjamb. But there's nobody there. Just the faintest hint of a draft.
dialog: Julia keeps
text: searching through the clutter. Moving shoes and boxes out of the way.
dialog: Searching.
text: Then, she spots
text: something glittering in the ribbon of light coming from the closet
dialog: doorway. A
text: small object resting in the corner. Julia reaches down and picks it up
speaker_heading: A PIECE OF
dialog: METAL ...
dialog: Small and
text: intricate with erratic markings. Twisted and strangely ornate. The
dialog: shape and
text: texture of the metal is almost completely alien.
dialog: Julia holds the
text: metal into the light. Extremely curious. Behind her, a shadow moves
speaker_heading: CRASH. Julia
text: SCREAMS, dropping the object and whirling around as a cardboard box
speaker_heading: SMASHES down
text: behind her. Tumbling from one of the shelves above. Old shoes scatter
dialog: across the
dialog: floor.
dialog: Julia catches
text: her breath. Heart pounding.
text: On the floor,
text: the metal object sparkles in the light. A draft HISSES through the
dialog: open closet
dialog: door.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST
speaker_heading: ROAD - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MIRA
speaker_heading: - LIBRARY - DAY
text: Julia walks up
text: the front steps leading to the library -- a weathered building that
dialog: overlooks

text: WELCOME TO THE FOUNDER'S DAY FAIR
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY -
scene_heading: READING ROOM - DAY
dialog: The stacks are
text: deserted and still. Julia sits at a reading table, flipping through a
dialog: book,
text: surrounded by long rows of bookshelves.
speaker_heading: INTERCUT - THE
speaker_heading: BOOK
dialog: Julia flips
text: from page to page, allowing momentary glimpses of various drawings:
dialog: vampires,
text: werewolves, witches, a ghastly thing crawling out from under a
dialog: maiden's bed.
speaker_heading: ON JULIA
dialog: as she puts
text: down the book and grabs another from a stack on the table. She opens
dialog: it and
text: starts paging through.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON - THE
speaker_heading: BOOK
dialog: As Julia finds
text: a drawing of a sleeping child. Just beyond the bed is an open closet
dialog: door, the
text: horrid face a MONSTER watching the child from within.
dialog: Julia shivers
text: down to her soul. A familiar feeling of late.
dialog: A slight
text: SQUEAKING catches her attention. She looks across the reading room to
dialog: find
speaker_heading: A YOUNG BOY
dialog: Ten years old.
text: Tow-haired. Sitting a few tables away but almost directly opposite
dialog: her. He's
text: wearing a Superman shirt.
dialog: He smiles
text: timidly and waves. Julia waves back.
speaker_heading: A THUMP behind
text: her. Julia turns and looks over her shoulder. She barely catches sight
dialog: ofa
text: shadow slipping across the wall in the stacks.
speaker_heading: The SCRAPING of
text: chair legs against the cold floor. Julia looks back towards where the
speaker_heading: BOY was
text: sitting. The chair is pushed back and empty.
dialog: Another
text: THUMPING in the stacks. Then silence.
dialog: A feeling of
text: anxiety washes over Julia as she grabs some of the books and leaves.

dialog: It's getting

scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: Soft rock seeps
text: from a pair of portable compact disc player speakers. Paul removes a
dialog: lid of
text: grass and some zigzag papers and starts to roll a joint. Everyone
dialog: looks pretty
text: toasted. Cardboard boxes and CANDLES are everywhere.
text: Sam is sitting
text: off to himself. He's still drawing on his pad. Julia is reading one of
dialog: the books
dialog: from the library.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (takes
dialog: a hit)
dialog: Monsters.
dialog: Symbols and dream images. Now you see, I don't agree with that. I
dialog: think
dialog: everything has some kind of physical representation. People can't just
dialog: come up
dialog: with this stuff.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You did a good
dialog: job last night.
text: Julia hands him
text: the metal object from the closet.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: And this? What
dialog: do you make of this?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Where'd you
dialog: find it?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: In the closet
dialog: you didn't leave open.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What's she
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (wearisome)
dialog: My girlfriend
dialog: believes in the Boogeyman.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I never said it
dialog: was the Boogeyman. Maybe it's some primeval energy that causes a
dialog: response in
dialog: human beings. This could be the physical representation of that
dialog: energy.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Julia. It's
dialog: piece of shit.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I disagree.
dialog: Julia turns
dialog: hopefully to Terry --
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It's the
text: physical representation of a piece of shit.
dialog: Pot-induced
text: laughter. Julia takes back the object.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You're not
dialog: being objective about this. Have either of you ever been scared?
dialog: Really
dialog: scared?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm scared
dialog: right now that you've smoked too much.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Paul ...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Okay. Sure.
dialog: I've been really scared.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Like when?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Maybe when we
dialog: hit the dog.
dialog: Sam looks
dialog: unsettled.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You mean
dialog: this?
text: Sam tosses his
text: sketch pad into the center of the floor. Everyone leans forward,
dialog: getting a good
text: look at Sam's detailed drawing of --
speaker_heading: THE ANIMAL LEG
dialog: Completely
text: fleshed out with distinct mechanical parts hinged into flesh and bone.
dialog: Almost as
text: accurate as a photograph.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: That thing we
text: hit on the road. It wasn't a dog. It wasn't some primeval force,
dialog: either.
dialog: (then)
dialog: It was a
dialog: monster.
dialog: Julia picks up
text: the drawing as Paul peers over her shoulder. The picture looks
dialog: particularly
text: unsettling in the flickering firelight.
dialog: It almost looks
dialog: alive.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: It's late. The
text: fire is dwindling. Terry and Sam have both passed out. Julia relaxes
dialog: on the
text: floor, staring at Sam's drawing while resting in Paul's lap.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I can't believe
dialog: Sam drew this.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can. He's
dialog: been acting like a freak.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You think we
dialog: could've been wrong?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: About the dog.
dialog: Maybe the next day when Sam and I went back to the road ... maybe we
dialog: found the
dialog: wrong body.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Can we drop
dialog: this? Please?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I just want to
dialog: know ...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (clipped)
dialog: Stop.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I just want to
dialog: know what's going on.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Nothing's going
dialog: on. Here, give me the drawing.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I'm not done
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Your hands are
dialog: shaking. Come on, Julia. Give yourself a break.
dialog: She hands the
text: drawing pad to him. Paul puts it on the couch.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: We need to talk
dialog: about this.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Tomorrow. Just
dialog: relax.
dialog: Paul begins
text: stroking her hair. Gently and repeatedly.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Just fora
dialog: minute.
dialog: Julia looks
text: really tired. She closes her eyes for a moment as Paul's steady
dialog: breathing fills
text: the room. The she opens them, turns her head and gazes at ...
speaker_heading: THE BLOND
text: STUDENT ...
dialog: Sitting ina
text: chair. Smoking a cigarette. Smiling down at her.
text: She cranks her
text: head and looks deeply into her boyfriend's eyes. He smirks and gently
dialog: strokes
dialog: her hair.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (soft)
dialog: You're tired.
dialog: Go to sleep.
dialog: Her breathing
text: becomes more steady.
dialog: In the

speaker_heading: A BROKEN WINE

dialog: Julia discovers

dialog: Julia looks
text: around. The sound seemed to come from behind her. But there's nothing
dialog: in the
text: room. Her friends are still asleep. Sam is concentrating on his
dialog: drawing.
text: More HISSING.
text: Unmistakable this time. A diminutive SCRAPING, almost like fingernails

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I didn't sleep
dialog: well either. I dreamt that all these cockroaches were eating my legs.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You want to
dialog: trade? Right before I woke up, my head exploded and all these snakes
dialog: came
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Where's
dialog: Sam?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Probably went
dialog: to bed.
dialog: Terry nods as
text: she rises to her feet.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I need a hairbrush. And a
dialog: facial.
text: She stumbles
text: into the hallway. Paul turns to Julia.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You had
dialog: nightmares too?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Worst ones I've
dialog: had in a long time. I thought I was hallucinating.
text: Paul winces and
text: rubs his temples.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: What's
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Headache. I'll

speaker_heading: HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: The group walks
text: towards one of the bedroom doors.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It's Sam. I
text: can't get the door open.
dialog: Paul tries the
text: doorknob. The door won't budge. Paul KNOCKS.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sam, open
dialog: up.
dialog: No answer. He
text: POUNDS harder.
speaker_heading: PAUL (cont'd)
dialog: Sam?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: He won't
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Maybe he can't
dialog: answer.
dialog: Paul shoves
text: hard against the door. But it still won't give.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What about the
dialog: bathroom door? It connects to your room.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I tried it.
dialog: It's locked.
dialog: Paul turns the
text: doorknob and throws all his weight against the door, trying his best
dialog: to bust it
dialog: down. No such luck.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (voice
dialog: rising)
dialog: Sam?
dialog: He tries again
text: and again. WHOOMPH! .... WHOOMPH! ....
speaker_heading: WHOOMPH! The

speaker_heading: PAUL

scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
scene_heading: GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: Paul struggles
text: through the aperture, slipping underneath a mattress that's been
dialog: placed against
text: the door, and stumbles into the room.
text: THE BEDROOM IS A DISASTER AREA.
dialog: Clothes and
text: smashed glass cover the floor. Mirrors have been shattered. Most of
dialog: the
text: furniture and portions of the bed have been piled in front of the
dialog: door, creating
text: an almost impassible barricade. The window
dialog: billowing
text: in the breeze.
dialog: Julia and Terry
text: make their way into the room. Stupefied.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Careful of the
dialog: glass. Don't step on it.
dialog: Total silence.
text: The group stares at the room. Taking it in.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What

scene_heading: WALKING TRAIL - DAY
dialog: Paul and Terry

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Sam?
dialog: No reply. Her

dialog: behind huge
text: pine trees that obscure them from view.
dialog: A soft breeze
text: rises up and HISSES through the trees.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
scene_heading: GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: Julia is
text: cleaning the mess in the room. She's just finished tossing a few
dialog: shards of
text: broken glass into a garbage bag when she FLINCHES and draws her index

dialog: back.
dialog: The finger has
text: a scab on it. Exactly where she cut it in the dream. Dried blood marks

scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: Terry looks
text: beside herself. Paul and Julia are seated.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: He must have
dialog: gotten out through the window. That's the only thing I can figure.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: We have to call
dialog: the police.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You looked
dialog: everywhere?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Everywhere near
dialog: the cabin. But we can't cover every square inch of forest out there.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: He might be
dialog: sick. He might need help.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: TI can't
dialog: understand why he'd do something like this.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: He was acting
dialog: nuts. Really nuts.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: I need a
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Wait. I've got
dialog: my cell.
dialog: Paul fishes the

speaker_heading: AND THE PHONE
speaker_heading: RINGS.
text: Almost on cue.
text: Terry glances over at her friends,
speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: Where are you?

dialog: How did you get

text: then clicks the receiver.
dialog: Terry hurriedly
text: grabs a pen. She starts writing on a pad.
speaker_heading: TERRY (cont'd)
dialog: Just a minute.
dialog: I'm writing it down. Market Street. The Ramada. I think I know where
dialog: it is.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sam, what's

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: San

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: He wants me to meet him. My brother has an apartment up there.
dialog: out of town,
dialog: but I have a spare key.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You still want
dialog: to call the police?
dialog: I guess I could stay there.
dialog: He's
dialog: Silence. Terry

text: An empty bus

dialog: Terry is using
text: a phone booth outside. She hangs up and walks into the depot.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Did you get his
dialog: parents?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It was the
dialog: wrong number.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Didn't Sam give
dialog: you that number?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Maybe I wrote
dialog: it down wrong.
text: Terry winces a
text: bit. She massages her legs.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Are you
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: My legs are
dialog: killing me.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You sure you
dialog: don't want us to drive you?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Nah. You have

text: The bus arrives

speaker_heading: TERRY (cont'd)
dialog: There's my

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: This is Paul's

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I just need to
dialog: talk to him. Don't call the police or anything until I've had a chance
dialog: to do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Thanks.
text: Terry hugs
text: Julia. Paul gives her a quick kiss on the cheek.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Remember. Call
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I will.
dialog: Carrying her

dialog: as she
text: opens it.
speaker_heading: TERRY (cont'd)
dialog: It'll be okay.
dialog: Everything's okay.
dialog: Her voice

scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I talked to the

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The company has

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I know. It's

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Are they coming

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It'll take them

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Three days.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (exhausted)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: Paul holds out

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I also found
text: this in the guest bedroom. Sam knocked one of the packing boxes over.
dialog: This was
dialog: inside.
dialog: Julia takes a
text: look at the frame. It's the same picture from her room of herself with
dialog: her
text: mother. The broken glass has torn the photograph.
speaker_heading: PAUL (cont'd)
dialog: I wasn't sure
dialog: if you wanted to keep it.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: No. I've got
dialog: one.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: You know this
dialog: is the only picture I have of my mother?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She was always
dialog: taking pictures of us, but we never got any of her.
dialog: (emotional)
dialog: If I didn't
dialog: have this, I couldn't prove that I had a mother.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's not
dialog: true.
dialog: Another

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I'm so worried

speaker_heading: PAUL

dialog: Good idea.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'll get my

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: ROSEMARY
dialog: Can we help
dialog: you, honey?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You can tell me
dialog: things just by holding something of mine. Right?
speaker_heading: ROSEMARY
dialog: Absolutely. I

dialog: and helped the state police catch a murderer in '81.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Wow. That's
dialog: amazing.
speaker_heading: ROSEMARY

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's kinda

speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: You and your

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TESS
dialog: Something

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: My parents got

speaker_heading: TESS

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: ROSEMARY
dialog: Something that

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: But you just

speaker_heading: ROSEMARY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: So how can a

speaker_heading: ROSEMARY
dialog: I don't make

speaker_heading: ROSEMARY
dialog: We stopped the

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: She said it was

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh sure. An

dialog: explanation? Rotten home life? Was it taking Prozac?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: It wanted to
dialog: stop the car.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Something about

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Nice to hear
dialog: your voice too.
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: You having
dialog: fun?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (understated)
dialog: Not

speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: I got my PSAT's
dialog: back. 720 verbal. 690 math. You think that's good enough to get into
dialog: Berkeley?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You'll get in.
dialog: Listen, is Dad there?
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Well could you
dialog: leave him a message?
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Tell him that
dialog: the movers didn't come, so I'll be here a few more days. Tell him that
dialog: I have
dialog: some stuff of Mom's that he might want.
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JULIA

scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM â€”
speaker_heading: DAY
dialog: A piece of

dialog: Julia gently

scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
scene_heading: BATHROOM - DAY

dialog: Weaker.
dialog: He grabs some

scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM â€”
speaker_heading: DAY
dialog: Julia leans
text: forward to get a better view of the developing picture. An image is
dialog: slowly
text: forming -- carousel horses, the vague outlines of poles and children.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
speaker_heading: BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: Paul is
text: shirtless and doing one-armed push-ups. His muscles churn. His body
dialog: rises and
text: falls like a piston.
scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM â€”
speaker_heading: DAY
dialog: The picture has
text: come into view. The carousel. The children laughing as they ride the
dialog: horses.
dialog: And something
dialog: else ...
dialog: An
text: irregularity. A dark form in the center of the carousel.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
speaker_heading: BEDROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: CLOSER ON

scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM â€”
speaker_heading: DAY
dialog: Julia takes the
text: picture out of the developing basin.
text: WE MOVE INTO THE PHOTO - THERE'S A DARK SHAPE
scene_heading: STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAROUSEL. BLURRED AND INDISTINCT. ALMOST
speaker_heading: LIKE A
text: SILHOUETTE OR A SHADOW.
text: EXCEPT THAT IT'S WAVING AT THE
speaker_heading: CAMERA.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN -
scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Paul is sitting
text: on the couch, wearing a UCLA cross country tank top and tying his
dialog: shoes. Julia
text: enters from the basement. She's carrying a stack of developed
dialog: pictures.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Paul, you have
dialog: to see this. The picture came out, but there's something really
dialog: strange in the
text: middle of it. Just like the other one of the shed.
text: He looks at the
dialog: picture.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Looks like
text: someone on the carousel.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: But there's no
text: features. It's like a shadow.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So there wasn't
dialog: enough light.
dialog: Paul rubs his
text: forehead. Julia is genuinely concerned.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What's the
dialog: matter?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: My head feels
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Maybe you
dialog: should lie down.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I have to go
dialog: running.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: No you
dialog: don't.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Of course I do.
dialog: Your body's like a machine. It needs
dialog: upkeep.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Not when you're
dialog: physically ill.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'll be
dialog: okay.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Paul ...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'll be
dialog: okay.
dialog: (about
dialog: the picture)
dialog: Is that it?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Not
dialog: exactly.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When I saw this
dialog: picture, I decided to look at the other one. Just for comparison's
dialog: sake.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So?
dialog: Julia takes out
dialog: another photograph.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I pulled this
text: one by mistake. The picture of that little girl from the party.
text: She hands him
dialog: the picture.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: Look.
dialog: Paul's face
text: collapses into slack disbelief.
text: THE LITTLE GIRL HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE
scene_heading: PHOTO. VANISHED.
dialog: Paul turns to
text: Julia as she looks into his eyes with a mixture of fear and
dialog: apprehension.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: What's going
dialog: on?
dialog: This time, he
dialog: doesn't have an answer.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS -
scene_heading: WALKING TRAIL - DAY
dialog: Murky and

text: Paul is jogging
text: along the trail, keeping a steady pace, the sounds of the forest all
dialog: around
dialog: him.
scene_heading: EXT. CREEK
speaker_heading: BRIDGE - DAY
dialog: The trail
text: snakes towards a wooden bridge that spans over a trickling creek. Paul
dialog: runs
text: across, the soles of his sneakers SLAPPING on creaking wood.
dialog: He moves deeper
text: into the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS -
speaker_heading: TRAIL - DAY
dialog: A lonely part
text: of the woods where almost all the daylight is blocked out by the
dialog: trees.
text: Paul jogs along
text: the trail when he slows to a halt, sweaty and out of breath. His skin
text: is pale.
text: His limbs are shivering. Paul cradles his head, shutting his eyes,
dialog: suffering
text: from obvious pain.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (very
dialog: soft)
dialog: Oh God ....
dialog: make it stop ...
dialog: He starts
text: walking forward again. Very slowly.
dialog: A slight
text: TINKLING sound as he kicks something at his feet. His eyes blink open
dialog: as he
dialog: looks down ...
text: THERE ARE SEVERAL PIECES OF METAL LITTERING
text: THE TRAIL. ALMOST LIKE NUTS AND BOLTS, BUT ALIEN IN THEIR DESIGN.
dialog: Paul reaches
text: down and picks one of the bolts up. Studies it. He keeps walking,
dialog: following more
text: pieces of metal that lead off the footpath.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -
speaker_heading: DAY
dialog: A darker spot
text: enclosed by pine trees. A few birds are singing overhead.
dialog: Paul enters the
text: forest, pushing back branches, following the trail of discarded metal
dialog: until he
text: freezes ... his eyes staring directly ahead at ...
speaker_heading: CLUMPS OF BLACK
dialog: SKIN ...
dialog: Hanging from
text: branches. Scattered on the ground. Like the skin of a snake which has
dialog: been
dialog: shed.
dialog: Paul is
text: completely unsettled. He kneels down, picking up a flap of skin from
dialog: the ground,
text: peeling it away from a steel ROD dripping with oozing slime. Holds it
dialog: up. It's
text: still black in color but almost transparent in the murky light.
speaker_heading: The wind HISSES
text: through the trees, mussing Paul's hair.
dialog: Paul drops the
text: piece of skin on the ground.
dialog: The birds
text: abruptly stop singing in unison. The WIND CEASES.
dialog: Paul looks
text: around the forest. The sudden quiet has got him spooked. His arms and
dialog: legs
text: stiffen. Paul can't even bring himself to move or breathe ...
speaker_heading: UNTIL SOMETHING
text: DROPS ON HIS SHOULDER ...
dialog: Paul freaks and
text: whirls around, grabbing his shoulder to find
speaker_heading: A PIECE OF SKIN
dialog: Clinging to
text: him. He rips it off and sprints for the footpath.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS -
speaker_heading: FOOTPATH - DAY
dialog: Paul sprints
text: out of the forest, running with blinding speed and adrenaline. He
dialog: doesn't look
dialog: back.
text: Behind him, the

scene_heading: LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: Julia comes up
text: from the basement. She hears COUGHING coming from the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM -
speaker_heading: NIGHT
dialog: Julia enters
text: the bathroom. Paul is retching and coughing into the toilet. Hair
dialog: plastered to
text: his forehead. Pale as death. Shaking badly.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Paul? What's
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (feeble)
dialog: Sick.
dialog: She goes to
text: him. Rubs his shoulders as he COUGHS again.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Oh baby ...
dialog: Julia brushes
text: the hair from his forehead. She freezes.
dialog: Just above his
text: temple is a SCAB. No bigger than the head of an eraser. Identical to
dialog: the one on
text: Julia's finger.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: Paul? Where did
dialog: this come from?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: This scab.
dialog: Julia runs her
text: finger over the scab. Paul immediately reels from her touch, pain
dialog: shooting
text: through his head, furious.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: JESUS! FUCK!
dialog: Julia is
text: shocked by the severity of his reaction.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: Paul holds his
text: head tight. Almost near tears. Fighting pain.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Just don't
dialog: touch it.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: How long has it
dialog: been there?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Ever since my
dialog: head started to hurt.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I think I'm
text: hallucinating.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What did you
dialog: see?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Skin ... like
dialog: it was shed ... and all of these metal pieces ...
dialog: Julia is
text: terribly concerned now. His description frightens her, but she
dialog: maintains a
text: visage of calm.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Do you want to
dialog: see a doctor? I know there's one in Santa Mira.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can see a
dialog: doctor in Los Angeles.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Look, I want to
dialog: get out of here, okay? Let's go home.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Okay.

speaker_heading: BEDROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Hello? ... Yes?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Wait a minute

dialog: Complete

scene_heading: ROVER - LATE AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Sure you don't

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm too sick. I

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I'm worried

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (shrugs)

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: See a

speaker_heading: CHIMES.
dialog: A few moments

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: standing on the

dialog: off his

dialog: He manages a

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Dad.
dialog: Standing at the
text: door is a man in his mid-fifties, MR. LOOMIS. A severe presence with a
dialog: soured
text: and weathered face. He stares at Paul without any sign of emotion.
dialog: Paul notices

dialog: trying to
dialog: connect.
speaker_heading: PAUL (cont'd)
dialog: I was hoping we

dialog: I know we

speaker_heading: PAUL (cont'd)
dialog: I'm in a lot of

dialog: Paul is having

speaker_heading: PAUL (cont'd)
dialog: I want to come

dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Please let me

speaker_heading: PAUL (cont'd)
dialog: Please?
dialog: His father

speaker_heading: MR. LOOMIS
dialog: I don't know

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm your

speaker_heading: MR. LOOMIS
dialog: I don't have a

scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - MARKET - LATE
speaker_heading: AFTERNOON
text: Julia is standing near the entrance. Waiting
dialog: patiently.
text: A figure across the street catches Julia's
text: attention -- a HOMELESS MAN stumbling down the sidewalk, talking to
dialog: himself,
text: shaking a rattle.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (0.8.)
dialog: Julia?
dialog: Julia turns
text: around, searching, not immediately recognizing the figure that briskly
dialog: approaches her --
dialog: It's Terry. But
text: her once perfect appearance has become harsh and drawn. Her blonde
dialog: hair has been
text: colored dark brown. There are sagging circles under her eyes. Her skin
dialog: is
text: colorless. She moves quickly. Nervously.
dialog: Julia is
dialog: shocked.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Terry?
dialog: Terry's hands
dialog: tremble.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'm glad you
dialog: came. You don't have any idea how scared I've been.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Why did you
dialog: change your hair?
dialog: Terry is about
text: to answer when a BABY starts crying in the market. Fear takes control
dialog: of her
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: We can't stay
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Where are you
dialog: parked?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: On the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Good. If we
dialog: keep moving, they might have trouble tracking us.
dialog: Terry takes
text: Julia's arm and leads her out of the market.
speaker_heading: EXT. SAN
scene_heading: FRANCISCO - STREET - CONTINUOUS
dialog: Terry is moving
text: at a swift pace. She keeps looking back over her shoulder as Julia
dialog: tries to keep

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What the hell
dialog: is going on? Where's Sam?
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: He's dead.
dialog: This almost
text: sends Julia reeling. Her mouth falls open.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: There's three
dialog: things you should remember. Three things.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: What happened
dialog: to Sam?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: First, whenever
dialog: you see a baby or a kid crying, keep moving.
dialog: That's
dialog: your warning.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Warning against
dialog: who?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Second, they
dialog: Children can sense them.
dialog: can control anything electrical or mechanical. Lamps. Cars. Phones.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Terry, you're
text: not making any sense.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Third -- they
dialog: can change things. They can make you disappear.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Tell me what
dialog: happened to Sam.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I am telling
dialog: you.
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: They took him.
dialog: They made him disappear.

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON THE

speaker_heading: The WHIRRING
text: becomes the HUMMING OF MACHINES.
dialog: The Range Rover
text: appears on the street and moves past.
speaker_heading: TERRY

scene_heading: INT. RANGE
scene_heading: ROVER - SAN FRANCISCO - MOVING
dialog: Julia is behind
text: the wheel. Terry is devouring a cigarette.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That's how they
dialog: get you. By making people not even care about you anymore.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Did you try
dialog: Sam's parents? Did you get the right number this time?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: The number I
dialog: called at the bus station was his parents.
dialog: (cryptic)
dialog: We didn't hit a
text: dog on the road.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: But I saw
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: They switched
dialog: bodies.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Who are "they?"
dialog: A cult? Killers?
dialog: Terry starts
text: laughing to herself. Tears welling in her eyes. Hopeless. Terrified.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You have no
dialog: idea. No idea what you're dealing with.
dialog: (then)
dialog: They don't even
dialog: belong here. They're like ... like machines. That's what Sam said.
dialog: Like
dialog: machines with all this skin and moving parts.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: They're
dialog: machines?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Monsters.
dialog: They're monsters, Julia.
text: Julia stops at
text: a light.
speaker_heading: A YOUNG GUY
text: crosses the street in front of them. He's just a yuppie with a cell

dialog: Then, almost as
text: an aside, he winks at her.
speaker_heading: TERRY (cont'd)
dialog: Drive.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I can't.
text: There's a red.
speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Remember when

dialog: (hushed)
dialog: It wasn't an
dialog: accident. It was a set-up. They planned it all along.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: How do you know
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Sam told me. He
dialog: figured everything out.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Why are they
dialog: coming after us? What do they want with us?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: They have flesh
dialog: and metal parts in their bodies. Sometimes they shed what they don't
dialog: need. But
dialog: other parts keep getting worn out or lost. So they take people
dialog: constantly to get
dialog: new parts.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (soft)
dialog: That's not
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: They wear the
dialog: skin. That's why you don't notice them. Half of the time they're
dialog: wearing
text: people's skin. Or they're hiding in dark places. Alleys. Closets.
dialog: Julia is
dialog: horrified.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Terry ...
dialog: please stop.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: They take other
dialog: parts too. Whatever they need. They're scavengers. No sense of
dialog: compassion. No
dialog: remorse.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I don't believe
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That's why they
text: came after us. They got Joey first. At the cabin.
dialog: Julia is
text: dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Joey?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That's what Sam
dialog: saw. That's why he left. He woke up and got a look at them -- at what
dialog: they were

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Terry ...
speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: JULIA
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: There were five
text: of us. He came up in his own car. He was

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: There were only

speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Look, could you

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Where are you

speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: They put things

speaker_heading: JULIA

dialog: Near the subway

dialog: The elevator

dialog: is
text: terrified. Sick.
text: She arrives at

text: A soft THUMPING in the hallway. Deep and
text: hollow. Terry spins around, the keys JINGLING in her hand.
dialog: Nothing there.
text: The hall appears to be empty and dark. One of the lights overhead is
dialog: flickering

dialog: She takes a

text: sound at her feet. Terry looks down to find a few pieces of METAL

text: A FEW MORE HOLLOW THUMPS.

scene_heading: STATION ENTRANCE - STAIRS - NIGHT
dialog: Paul is nowhere

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Paul?!
dialog: Julia looks
text: around desperately. She can't find him in the crowds on the sidewalks.
dialog: She turns
text: and looks down the stairs towards the open entryway to the subway
dialog: system.
dialog: Paul is walking
text: through the entryway. A friend with him is patting him on the
dialog: shoulder. Just
text: after Paul has disappeared through the entryway, the friend turns
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: IT'S SAM.
dialog: His lips are
text: parched, pitch black eyes bulging, his features somehow more twisted

dialog: runs.
text: SMALL PIECES OF METAL DROP FROM SAM'S PANTS

speaker_heading: JULIA

scene_heading: STATION - UPPER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS
dialog: The upper level

dialog: Julia is

dialog: She looks
text: around frantically. Spots Paul and Sam going down the escalator
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Paul!
dialog: Julia rushes

speaker_heading: GUARD

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Paul?!
dialog: No
dialog: response.
speaker_heading: A train RUMBLES
text: through the station. Julia moves to the opposite side and looks.
dialog: Resting on the
text: tracks, leading into the tunnel, are a trail of metal pieces. Exactly
dialog: like the
text: ones from the cabin.
dialog: Julia looks
text: back. The GUARD is coming down the escalator.
dialog: Without
text: hesitation, she jumps down to the tracks. Moving quickly and bending
dialog: down to
text: avoid being seen, she rushes into the awaiting subway tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY
speaker_heading: TUNNEL - NIGHT
dialog: Drowned in
text: shadows. An unnatural silence fills the tunnel.
dialog: Julia moves
text: cautiously amongst the tracks. Eyes scanning the darkness. Following
dialog: the trail
dialog: of discarded metal.
speaker_heading: A SHARP
speaker_heading: HISSING.
dialog: Julia spins
text: around. A few more HISSING SOUNDS rise from electrical sparks on the
dialog: tracks.
text: Blue light flashes within the tunnel. Then, it ceases.
text: She turns back
text: to continue her search, wind sifting through her hair, when she finds
speaker_heading: A LARGE
speaker_heading: HOLE
text: At the base of
text: the subway wall. Julia reaches down and palms a few metal pieces at
dialog: the base of
dialog: the hole.
dialog: She peers
text: inside. A dull flickering light flashes within.
dialog: Julia takes a
text: calming breath. She moves into the hole.
scene_heading: INT. CRAWL
scene_heading: SPACE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: A narrow and
text: claustrophobic space. Julia squirms through the confined space,
dialog: pulling herself
text: towards the flashing light.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR -
speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS
dialog: Julia pulls
text: herself through another opening and finds herself standing in the
dialog: threshold of a
text: corridor. Both the walls and floor are constructed of crude metal
dialog: grates and
text: long pipes. Anything could be hiding within. Waiting.
dialog: She moves
text: slowly into the corridor, a STROBE LIGHT flickering around her. She
text: gropes
text: towards another opening.
dialog: The sound of
text: her TERRIFIED BREATHING is slowly replaced by the RHYTHMIC HUMMING OF
speaker_heading: MACHINES.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL
speaker_heading: - CONTINUOUS
dialog: Steam rises
text: from the pipes. Bathing the stairwell in mist.
dialog: The fluorescent
text: lights above are glimmering in the darkness. Julia stands at the top
dialog: of the
text: stairwell. She can't even see the bottom of the steps.
dialog: Carefully, she
text: starts moving down. Her hand gripping the metal railing.
speaker_heading: The HUMMING OF
text: MACHINES grows louder
dialog: Her foot
text: accidentally kicks a few pieces of metal on the steps. A light
dialog: CLINKING as the
text: metal scatters down ahead of her.
speaker_heading: The HUMMING OF
text: MACHINES is closer now. Just beyond the sheathing clouds of blue and
dialog: white
dialog: mist.
dialog: The metal
text: railing is suddenly replaced by HUMAN BONES.
dialog: Julia pulls her
text: hand away from the railing. Looks skyward and discovers more BONES are
dialog: being
text: used to brace the ceiling along with metal beams.
text: She stops.
text: Shutting her eyes in fear. Starts to lose control.
dialog: From somewhere
text: within, she manages to steady herself. Keeps going through the
dialog: awaiting steam
text: curtain at the bottom.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN
scene_heading: HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS
dialog: The steam parts
text: to reveal a dark space. Cold and damp.
dialog: Julia moves
text: into the main hallway, stumbling through a hallway that can best be
dialog: described as
text: a living nightmare. Mammoth pipes and human skin has been fashioned
dialog: together
text: into a wall, pulsating with the HEARTBEAT OF MACHINES that saturates
dialog: the entire
dialog: hallway.
text: Steam jets into
text: the hallway intermittently from the pipes. Creating great clouds.
dialog: Julia is beyond
text: horrified. Her face registers a numbness. Complete and total
dialog: astonishment.
dialog: Human bones and
text: body parts have been so expertly fashioned into the corridor that it's
dialog: impossible to distinguish where the organic ends and the mechanical
text: begins.
dialog: She enters
text: another corridor. Her face is struck by a JET OF HISSING STEAM.
dialog: She presses
text: onward. Slipping past the skulls and littered metal on the floor.
speaker_heading: Another BLAST
text: OF STEAM.
dialog: Something leaps
text: out of the middle of it.
text: Julia whirls
text: back around a corner, pressing flat against the wall as a BLACK SHAPE
dialog: moves
text: through the steam. Unidentifiable features. Movements that suggest
dialog: nothing by
text: chaos and madness.
speaker_heading: The SHAPE
text: HISSES and CROAKS in the hallway.
text: Julia waits.
text: She doesn't even breathe. The HISSING stops.
dialog: She gradually
text: turns to peek back into the hallway where the thing once stood.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
speaker_heading: JULIA'S EYES
dialog: as she looks
text: around the corner. The shape has disappeared.
dialog: Carefully she
text: keeps going forward. Drenched in water and sweat. Slipping through the
dialog: steam
text: clouds that mask another entrance.
scene_heading: INT. LAIR -
speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: A massive room
text: where empty human skins are dangling from hooks, complete and
dialog: preserved from
text: head to toe. The skins sway and rock gently in the draft. Thousands of
dialog: them.
dialog: Julia moves
text: towards the center of the room.
dialog: A large
text: OPERATING TABLE awaits. But the surface of the table is sunken like a
dialog: water
text: basin. Next to the table is a pedestal littered with BLOODY
text: INSTRUMENTS. Cutting
text: tools. Knives. Curved hooks.
dialog: Julia notices
text: that Paul's torn clothes are resting at the foot of the table. Shirt
dialog: shredded to
text: a rag. Sneakers orphaned nearby. Jeans spattered with blood.
dialog: Her breathing
text: quickens. Her heart POUNDING.
text: She reaches the
text: foot of the table. Paul is lying within the basin, completely naked
dialog: and
text: partially covered with LITTERED BODY PARTS. Organs and entrails.
dialog: The basin is
text: filled with water and blood. An immobile form is resting next to him.
dialog: Julia moves
text: quickly. She tries to wake him up.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Paul. Paul,
dialog: wake up.
text: He stirs. His
text: nose crinkles slightly.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: Wake up.
text: She grabs him
text: and lifts him up. He starts COUGHING.
speaker_heading: JULIA (cont'd)
dialog: You've gotta
dialog: hurry.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Here
dialog: Julia grabs his
text: jeans. She helps him slide down from the basin and he pulls them on.
speaker_heading: A skinned HAND
text: grabs hers. Julia yelps a SCREAM.
dialog: The other form
dialog: -- a THING in the basin -- rises
text: and turns. Slicked with blood. Empty sockets where the eyes should be.
dialog: Mouth
text: falling open. A horror that shouldn't be alive.
speaker_heading: Julia SCREAMS
dialog: again.
dialog: Her free hand
text: grabs a HOOK from the pedestal and swings the blade into the thing's
dialog: neck. Blood
text: fountains up.
dialog: The thing
text: begins SHRIEKING.
dialog: With Paul
text: leaning on her for support, Julia rapidly heads for the door.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN
scene_heading: HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS
dialog: Julia navigates
text: her way through the hallways. Moving blindly through sudden JETS OF
speaker_heading: STEAM, the
text: sound of MACHINES around them. Paul leans on her, his eyes remaining
dialog: closed,
text: COUGHING and stumbling.
speaker_heading: JULIA'S POV
dialog: Racing through
text: the halls. The steam clouds suddenly EXPLODING into her view.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL
speaker_heading: - CONTINUOUS
dialog: Julia reaches

dialog: shoulder.
text: Nothing behind them.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR -
speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS
text: Julia stops at
text: the corridor opening. The strobe light FLASHES within. Clicking.
dialog: The corridor
text: looks empty. Nothing but pipes and shadows.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: We're almost
dialog: there.
dialog: Julia turns to
text: Paul and finds a face with glaring yellow eyes and metal teeth. He
dialog: stares back
dialog: at her.
dialog: A moment of
text: sheer horror. Julia reels back into the corridor. Pressed flat against
dialog: the wall.
text: Sliding towards the crawl space opening.
dialog: Paul starts
text: advancing into the corridor. Grinning with teeth that flash with every
dialog: click of
text: the strobe light.
dialog: She keeps
dialog: sliding away
text: He grabs his
text: chest and RIPS IT OPEN, tearing the covering skin apart as he would a
dialog: shirt. A
text: menagerie of human bones and metal are revealed behind it.
dialog: Julia tries to
text: scream. Eyes wide. She can't make a sound.
dialog: Paul tears the
text: skin covering his chest wider. Pulling it away. Stripping himself
dialog: clean.
dialog: Julia reaches
text: the crawl space. Sliding down.
dialog: The last pieces
text: Paul's skin are torn off. The thing that had been pretending to be
dialog: Paul stands
text: in his place.
dialog: Only brief
text: glimpses are allowed by the strobe light. An abysm of immemorial
dialog: lunacy
text: consisting of fashioned human parts and twisted metal. A human heart
dialog: beating
text: within exposed ribs. Bones combined with pulleys and rods. The face of
text: a skull.
dialog: A contradiction of all matter and cosmic order.
dialog: Julia slips
text: back into the crawl space. Still

scene_heading: TUNNEL - STATION OPENING - NIGHT

text: Moving quickly. Panicked.

speaker_heading: BEHIND HER, A
text: CHORUS OF PURSUING MONSTROUS SCREAMS RISE UP WITHIN THE TUNNEL.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY
scene_heading: STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
dialog: Julia runs
text: directly parallel to the subway platform. The lights alongside of her
dialog: start
text: flickering and go out, one by one, as she advances.
speaker_heading: THE HISSING AND
text: SCREAMING CONTINUES TO RISE.
text: She reaches the
text: opposite tunnel and grabs hold of the platform, pulling herself up.
dialog: The platform
text: goes dark.
dialog: Appearing out
text: of the far tunnel are a DOZEN DARK SHAPES, scampering along the walls
dialog: and
text: running on all fours across the tracks. Their characteristics barely
dialog: visible.
dialog: Julia kicks
text: back as the shrieking things bear down on her, yellow eyes flaring in
dialog: the dark,
text: metal teeth flashing.
dialog: Julia tries to
text: run for the escalator, but the things cover the walls behind the
dialog: tracks. Ready
dialog: to spring.
dialog: Finally, one of
text: the monsters does leap towards her
dialog: AND IS SMASHED
text: TO BITS BY AN APPROACHING BART TRAIN.
dialog: Reducing the
text: monster to a few vestiges of scattered metal. The other creatures on
dialog: the tracks
dialog: are also run down.
dialog: Julia watches
text: as the train RUMBLES past. And then, silence.
dialog: Nothing is left
text: except for a few swirling newspapers. The lights flicker and come back
dialog: to
dialog: life.
dialog: Rising up to
text: her feet, rescued from death by chance, Julia starts backing towards
dialog: the
text: escalator. Her eyes locked upon the darkened tunnel before she turns
dialog: and races
dialog: up.
