scene_heading: INT. GUEST BEDROOM - PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A COUPLE sleeps on a king size bed. The valley in the
text: thousand count sheets between them is noticeably wide.
text: A strange LIGHT streaks through the closed blinds of the
text: floor-to-ceiling WINDOWS lining the wall beside the bed.
text: Shadows dance over their faces.
text: She stirs. Her name is ELAINE, 20s, a natural beauty.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: How’s it morning already?
text: JARROD rolls over. 20s, thin and darkly handsome. The clock
text: reads: 3:50 A.M. He throws a pillow over his head.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: It’s not. It’s... jet lag.
text: Elaine puts her hand on her stomach. Feeling nauseous.
text: She stumbles across the plush shag carpet towards the
text: bathroom. Opens the glass door. The wrong way at first.
text: CUT TO:
text: FLUSH. She exits the bathroom, looking worse for the wear.
text: Looks back towards the bed. The LIGHT outside seems to have
dialog: grown even brighter.
text: She slowly opens the bedroom door, peeking out in the
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: It’s even brighter in here. And way more expensively
text: decorated. Remnants of last night’s party lie strewn across
text: the granite counter tops, not to mention RYAN and DENISE,
text: sleeping on the shag and L shaped leather sofa respectively.
text: Shaking her head, Elaine closes the bedroom door.
text: As she moves onto the bed, the LIGHT outside goes nuclear
text: hot, like someone just switched on the mid day SUN.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Jarrod...
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Morning sickness again?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: No, look!
text: Then the building starts SHAKING.
text: He rubs the hangover out of his eyes to see the lights coming
text: from behind the blinds. That is weird. He gets up, moving
text: towards the windows.
text: Raising his hand, he begins to open the blinds when-
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Ryan... oh my God...
text: Her shout comes from the LIVING ROOM.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you-
text: WHOMP. WHOMP. Her voice is drowned out by an odd FREQUENCY.
text: Jarrod looks to the now intensely frightened Elaine.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Stay here.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I don’t know-
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: RYAN!
text: He motions for Elaine to stay put as he hustles into the:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: The room is bathed in an EERIE BRIGHT LIGHT. Jarrod has to
text: shield his eyes just to see.
text: DENISE is crouched on the sofa, pure fear on her face.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: He’s gone!
text: Turning to his left, Jarrod peers through the open BALCONY
text: DOOR at the strangely beautiful light shining from outside.
text: Jarrod’s HANDS fall to his side, VEINS BULGING outwards. His
text: knuckles go white. His pupils as big as quarters and black as
dialog: night.
text: WHOMP. WHOMP. The FREQUENCY drowns out everything, filling
text: Jarrod’s head with a mesmerizing rhythm, pushing him forward
text: as the LIGHT FLARES OVER HIM.
text: FADE TO:
text: TITLE: 15 HOURS EARLIER...
text: The frequency gives way to the sound of AIRPLANE ENGINES.
text: The WHITE HOT LIGHT fades, revealing JARROD’S FACE.
text: Eyes closed. Hair flapping in the wind. Smiling.
text: He leans his head back inside the BACK WINDOW of...
scene_heading: INT. ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM - DAY
text: CLASSIC ROCK plays on the radio. He rolls up the window.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: It’s beautiful, huh?
text: Beside him sits ELAINE. She stares out her window, watching
text: strip malls and power lines streak by.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (playful)
dialog: Oh yeah. Breathtaking.
text: He leans over and looks out her window: TACO BELL, KFC, CHECK
dialog: CASHING, etc.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Okay, I’1l admit. I was expecting
dialog: more palm trees.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: The Phantom certainly fits the part.
text: They laugh. Look around the car.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Well, Terry said he’d roll out the
dialog: red carpet but this is insane.
text: She looks at the TWO TELEVISIONS on the seat backs.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I know, I’m afraid to touch
dialog: anything.
text: Jarrod stretches his arm across the seat. Pulls her in close.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I’m not...
text: Gently caresses her cheek.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: If you break it you buy it.
text: She playfully pushes him off. But he leans in and kisses her
dialog: tenderly.
scene_heading: EXT. WESTCHESTER - LINCOLN BLVD - DAY
text: The black Phantom crests a hill, revealing the picturesque
text: VISTA of the Pacific Ocean, mountains and Marina Del Rey.
speaker_heading: JARROD (0.S.)
dialog: Now that’s more like it.
scene_heading: EXT. THE COVE HIGH RISE - DAY
text: The Phantom pulls into a CUL DE SAC. All sides are flanked by
text: modern high rise condos.
text: Straight ahead, center, is THE COVE. The newest and most
text: luxurious. Nineteen stories of glittering glass and steel.
scene_heading: EXT. THE COVE FRONT ENTERANCE - DAY
text: Before the LIMO DRIVER can even step out, Jarrod swings his
text: door open. He takes Elaine’s hand, helping her out. Together
text: they look up at the Cove, taking it in.
text: The Limo Driver places a overnight bag on the walk way, and
text: extends the handle. He hands Jarrod a tattered duffel bag.
text: Jarrod grabs his wallet, chained to his pants. Thumbs through
text: three crumpled twenties, a five and lots of singles.
speaker_heading: LIMO DRIVER
dialog: It’s all taken care of, sir.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Oh, okay. Thanks.
text: Jarrod rolls Elaine’s bag to the FRONT DOOR.
scene_heading: INT. THE COVE LOBBY - DAY
text: The lobby is immaculately furnished. Spotless and new.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Wow. He lives in a hotel?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Special effects must pay well.
text: The CONCIERGE’S name tag reads “OLIVER”. Early 40s, world-
text: weary. He taps the counter lightly. His ornate WEDDING RING
text: makes a soft click. He speaks in a welcoming voice.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Good afternoon. Welcome to The
dialog: Cove. How may I assist you?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Going up to Terry Sergeant's.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Ah, the party, of course. Enjoy
dialog: yourselves.
text: Oliver and Elaine exchange smiles.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: They watch the LED floor display until it hits ‘19’.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Penthouse.
text: She raises her eyebrow. Jarrod shakes his head.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Elaine and Jarrod emerge from the elevator bank, almost
text: bumping into a group of bikini clad GIRLS - early 20s.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Excuse us.
text: The girls giggle and pile into the elevator, heading down.
text: WORLD MUSIC echoes down the hall as Jarrod and Elaine make
text: their way to Penthouse six. The DOOR’S OPEN.
text: They walk inside. It’s filled with PEOPLE. A party.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN/ LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The living room, kitchen and lounge are a MASSIVE OPEN ROOM.
text: A marvel of European design. The floor to ceiling windows
text: offer a panoramic view of Los Angeles’ skyline.
text: Jarrod and Elaine wander through the crowd, looking lost.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Smile!
text: FLASH. They turn to see DENISE. A professional SLR CAMERA in
text: her hands. Mid 20s. Beautiful and bohemian.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Cute pic. You must be Jarrod.
text: Denise leans forward, kissing both of Jarrod’s cheeks.
speaker_heading: DENISE (CONT'D)
dialog: Denise.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Hey. This is my girlfriend Elaine.
text: Elaine extends her hand to Denise for a shake.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Kisses on the west coast.
text: Denise kisses her on each cheek.
speaker_heading: DENISE (CONT'D)
dialog: Terry’s around here somewhere.
text: Elaine looks around the penthouse. Her eyes widen. She moves
text: towards a pop art PAINTING. A sexy girl with a gun.
speaker_heading: DENISE (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: Mojito’s okay?
text: Elaine turns. Works from the SAME ARTIST are everywhere.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I thought you sold these.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I did. Technically.
text: Denise interrupts, handing them each a MOJITO.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Aren’t they amazing? Like Andy
dialog: Warhol meets Jack Kirby. Cheers.
text: The three clink glasses. Jarrod and Denise imbibe.
speaker_heading: DENISE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey you!
text: Denise recognizes another PARTY GOER and wanders off.
text: Elaine rolls her eyes. Turns to hand Jarrod her untouched
text: drink. He gives her a knowing grin.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: That was polite of you.
text: She smiles back.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (LOUD)
dialog: Is Brooklyn in the house?!
text: TERRY struts towards them. Early 30s. African American.
text: Chiseled frame. Tank top. Sunglasses. Larger than life.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Look at Mr. California!
text: Terry grabs Jarrod, HUGGING him tight.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: Happy birthday man. Damn, forgot
dialog: how strong you are.
text: Terry pulls away, laughing.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: How could you? After that rumble
dialog: down in the Bowery?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Hey, I was twice as drunk as you.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (Re: the two mojitos)
dialog: Careful now, looks like you’re well
dialog: on your way.
text: Terry launches a playful jab. Even his play feels tough.
text: Elaine is amused by the bro-mance. She stands next to a
text: framed magazine cover of a GORGEOUS MODEL.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me, where are my manners?
text: Terry approaches Elaine, taking her hand.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Terry. And you must be the one and
dialog: only Elaine.
text: With that he kisses her hand. Elaine can’t help but smile.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Thank you so much for the ride.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Anything for family.
text: CLACK. CLACK. High heels walk across the wooden floor.
text: They turn to see CANDICE, early 30s. The same gorgeous model
text: from the framed photo. In a bikini, with a D&G towel around
text: her waist. Her nose buried in a BLACKBERRY.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, this is my girl Candice.
text: Candice looks up from her blackberry. Extending her hand to
dialog: each of them. Almost too formally.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: Goes right back to texting.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: As you can see, it’s pool time.
dialog: Throw your suits on. We’re losing
text: sun.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POOL AREA - DAY
text: The pool area is lavish, complete with jacuzzi, fireplace,
text: dance area, and outdoor bar. A sea of PARTY PEOPLE mill
text: about: lounging, swimming, drinking. It’s LA incarnate.
text: Candice leads the girls towards the jacuzzi.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (Arm around Jarrod)
dialog: Bar's this way.
text: Jarrod looks to Elaine.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: You good?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Club soda. Make it a double.
text: He smiles and heads off with Terry.
text: Denise and Candice lay out their towels and disrobe. Elaine
text: watches them reveal their flawless bodies. She caresses her
text: stomach for a moment.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL BAR - DAY
text: Jarrod and Terry lean against the bar, taking in the view. A
text: cute ASIAN BARTENDER pours them shots. Makes more drinks.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: You really did it man. Just like
dialog: everyone knew you would.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Couldn't have done it without you.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: What did I do? Decorate your walls?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: They do look nice.
text: They both laugh, toast and down the shots.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Can’t thank you enough for all
dialog: this. I mean, I’m the one who
dialog: should be getting you the gift.
text: The bartender serves them each a Margarita. Rocks. Salt.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Don’t worry, I got some ideas on
dialog: that.
scene_heading: EXT. JACUZZI - DAY
text: Denise has her feet in the Jacuzzi. Scanning the crowd with
text: her camera. Focuses on Jarrod at the bar. Clicks away.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: So how did you guys meet?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Believe it or not, my boss set us
text: up.
dialog: 10.
text: Elaine takes off her T-shirt, revealing a modest, yet
text: flattering bikini. Her body is curvy. Sexy.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: And what is it you do?
text: Elaine sits on the edge of the jacuzzi, legs dipping in.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Publishing.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: Anything I’d know?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: It’s a small firm. Mostly art books.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Cool. I’m a photographer, you know-
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: Is there any money in that?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: It pays the bills. And I love it.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: That’s important, especially ina
dialog: fading profession.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Well, nothing last forever, right?
speaker_heading: TERRY (0.S.)
dialog: Everyone’s gettin’ along famously I
dialog: see.
text: Terry and Jarrod approach the jacuzzi. Drinks in hand.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: Where’s my cosmo?
text: Terry cringes, shrugs. Candice pretends she isn’t enraged.
speaker_heading: CANDICE (CONT’D)
dialog: Denise?
text: Denise bites her lip. Nods.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Anyone else?
text: No takers. She pulls herself out and sulks towards the bar.
dialog: 11.
text: Jarrod sits down next to Elaine, legs soaking in the water.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Beats December in Brooklyn.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I don’t know, I kinda like having
dialog: four seasons.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: We got one of those down the block.
text: Elaine concedes with a smile.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: But wait until tomorrow-
text: A faint RUMBLING is heard in the distance.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re gonna take to the high seas
dialog: on my new Sunseeker.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: For real?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: A 47 footer. Nothing too crazy.
text: Terry raises his voice to compete with the GROWING RUMBLE.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: My starter Yacht.
text: The RUMBLE is now THUNDEROUS, drowning out all voices.
text: A SQUADRON OF BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS PASSES OVERHEAD.
text: Elaine and Jarrod look up in awe. The rest of the party could
text: care less. Candice texts. Terry sips his drink casually.
text: The Blackhawks pass. The rumble fades into the distance.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Michael Bay must be coming back
dialog: from dinner.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Who?
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: EXT. FIREPLACE AREA - SUNSET
text: The party has stepped up a notch. Scantily clad WOMEN mingle
text: with well dressed MEN.
text: Terry leads Jarrod and Elaine through the crowd.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yo Ryan!
text: RYAN swings around. Big grin on his scruffy, yet boyish face.
text: He and Terry hug it out.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: How’s that robot fight coming along?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It sucks. But the director loves it.
dialog: (Looks to Jarrod & Elaine)
dialog: Oh, is this the boy wonder? And his
dialog: lovely lady...
text: Ryan toasts to Jarrod then Elaine.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Great to finally meet you man. I
dialog: hear you’re gonna join the crew?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: (Caught off guard)
dialog: Huh? I don’t-
text: A surprised Elaine glares at the completely puzzled Jarrod.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (To Elaine)
dialog: Find a spot to live yet? Let me
dialog: tell you, Venice is the place to be-
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: We'll keep that in mind. Excuse me.
text: She shoots Jarrod a cool glance before leaving.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Gotta use the little girl’s room.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Elaine, hold on-
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (Oblivious)
dialog: Bro, she is smokin’.
dialog: 13.
text: Terry gives Ryan the stink eye. Puts his arm around Jarrod,
text: walks him towards the fireplace at the edge of the party.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: What the hell was that about?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Alright man, cat’s out of the bag.
dialog: (Let’s out a sigh)
dialog: I was thinking you should come out
dialog: here. I could use you.
text: Jarrod starts shaking his head.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: No, to hell with that. I need you.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: What for? I don’t know anything
dialog: about effects, man.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: But you have the eye. You know it.
dialog: Just apply it to something slightly
dialog: different. Computer’s just a tool.
dialog: Like a paintbrush.
dialog: (He takes a sip)
dialog: Just that my brushes cost 200 grand
dialog: each.
text: Terry smirks. But Jarrod still isn’t sure.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I don’t know... I just never saw
dialog: myself out here.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Come on, man. It’s time to step up.
dialog: (he takes another sip)
dialog: Look. There are other artists.
dialog: Sure. But I need someone I can
dialog: trust. This whole town is full of
dialog: flakes. What I need is a brother.
text: Terry puts out for a fist bump. Jarrod leaves him hanging.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: What about Elaine?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Well, I can’t take care of
dialog: everything.
dialog: 14.
text: Candice approaches in a stunning dress. Terry winks and takes
text: her hand, leading her onto the dance floor.
scene_heading: EXT. DANCE AREA - NIGHT
text: The vibe is festive. Dancing guests have overflowed into the
text: lounge area. Terry and Candice move sensually to the music.
text: Ryan and Denise stand by the edge of the dance area.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: So you want to head upstairs or-
text: Jarrod walks past, looking for Elaine.
text: Denise ignores Ryan, stepping right in front of Jarrod.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Whoa! Watch it. You okay?
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: I’m perfect.
text: She downs her cosmo. Smiles with a drunken gaze.
speaker_heading: DENISE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're fun.
text: Denise moves closer to Jarrod. Yelling into his ear.
speaker_heading: DENISE (CONT'D)
dialog: We don’t get ones like you out
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: (Sheepish)
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: She paws his chest and pulls him onto the dance floor.
text: Writhing around Jarrod. He reluctantly moves to the beat.
text: Terry points and laughs.
text: Elaine watches from across the floor, with her arms crossed.
speaker_heading: RYAN (0.S.
dialog: Looks like you could use a drink.
text: She turns to see Ryan.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: No thanks.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Seriously, not my night.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: How about a dance instead?
text: Elaine takes the lead. Ryan happily tries to keep up.
text: Jarrod and Elaine’s eyes meet. After a long beat, she sticks
text: her tongue out at him. Jarrod cracks a big smile.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: It’s a total scene. Models. Rockers. Power nerds. Drinking.
text: Dancing. Smoking on the patio. The music plays loud.
text: The L-shaped COUCH is packed, shoulder to shoulder.
text: Ryan sits with a pouch of tobacco, rolling a cigarette on
text: Candice’s fashion magazine. He’s pressed against Elaine.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: For real, I can’t stand cars.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: But don’t you need one out here?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Don’t believe that propaganda.
text: He finishes rolling the butt with a lick across the paper.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I even bike to dates. If a lady
dialog: don't like it, I don’t want her ass
dialog: on my handlebars anyhow.
text: A noticeably looser Jarrod approaches. Fresh drink in hand.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Hey twinkle toes. How are you
dialog: feeling?
text: He sits down next to Elaine. Spills some on her sleeve.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Sorry, my bad.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: No worries.
text: She gives him a frustrated look as he pats down her sleeve.
dialog: 16.
text: Ryan gets up and slides open the PATIO DOOR. Looks to Elaine.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Puff on the patio? House rules.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: No thanks, trying to cut down.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Same here. How about you party boy?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Sure. Why not?
text: Jarrod follows Ryan out. Slides the door shut, leaving Elaine
dialog: by herself. Again.
text: A DOUCHE BAG approaches her almost immediately. Cheesy grin.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIO - NIGHT
text: SMOKE wafts through the air. Jarrod hands the butt to Ryan.
text: There’s a handful of other SMOKERS on the patio with them.
text: Through the patio glass door: Elaine blows off the Douche and
text: storms into the guest bedroom, slamming the door behind her.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: That can’t be good.
text: Jarrod sighs and heads back inside. Ryan smiles when...
text: A strange blue LIGHT FLASHES across the sky. Ryan spins
text: around, staring out at the city with a puzzled look.
text: He turns to a SMOKING MODEL.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you see that?
dialog: (Off her vacant look)
dialog: It was the same color as your eyes.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Elaine storms into the bedroom. Grabs the bathroom door
text: handle. It’s locked. VOICES inside. Camera FLASHES reveal the
text: silhouette of entwined BODIES through the FROSTED GLASS.
text: Jarrod enters the room. Shuts the door behind him.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Elaine. Come on.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You come on. It’s like you've
dialog: already decided for both of us.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Decided? Terry just sprung this
dialog: California talk on me today.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I’m not talking about California!
text: The bathroom door swings OPEN. Denise sloppily emerges.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Oh. Sorry.
text: She quickly leaves the room. Elaine turns to Jarrod.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I am trying to deal with this and
dialog: you're getting wasted, leaving me
dialog: with total strangers. Is a little
dialog: consideration too much to ask?
text: Jarrod runs his hands through his hair. Feeling guilty.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I'm sorry. I... I’m just stressed-
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: And what about me Jarrod? My
dialog: career, my body...
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I am with you. Whatever you choose.
text: Jarrod steps closer to Elaine. He takes her hands.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s just that... I don’t know...
dialog: What kind of father can’t even pay
dialog: his own rent?
text: The bathroom door opens again. They do a double take as TERRY
text: walks out.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Hey. Just checking on... something.
text: He leaves without any further embarrassment.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Great. Is that what we have to look
dialog: forward to?
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: No. Terry's always been that way.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What about you? Ever been “that
dialog: way?”
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Elaine. I am not Terry. Alright?
text: She hesitates, slowly backing away from him.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: People change. Especially in L.A.
text: With that she steps in the bathroom and closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM/ LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT
text: Everyone crowds around the BIG SCREEN TV. The image is a LIVE
text: FEED from a high tech TELESCOPE that Ryan is operating.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Wait! I think I got a live one!
text: Ryan whips the telescope, panning across nearby apartments.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s see what’s behind door...
dialog: number... one!
text: TELESCOPE POV: In a neighbor’s WINDOW, where a MAN sits with
text: a short haired WOMAN kneeling before him. Head in his lap.
text: The party bursts into LAUGHS and CHEERS.
text: Candice sits in the kitchen. Sipping wine. Not amused.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We have a weiner! Look at her go!
text: TELESCOPE POV: The woman looks up from her knees to reveal
text: she’s not a woman at all. But another MAN.
text: Ryan spits out his drink, collapses in laughter.
speaker_heading: PARTY GUY
dialog: Yeah, boys! Show’em how it’s done!
text: The doorbell RINGS.
dialog: 19.
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The noise is audible. The door swings open. Candice stands
text: there, looking up and down at Oliver.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Pardon me, ma’‘am, but we’ve
dialog: received a few noise complaints.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
text: From who? The building’s half empty.
text: Oliver lets out a polite laugh.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I understand. But it’s two in the
dialog: morning. So. If you don’t mind...
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: Fine.
text: Candice purses her lips in a KISS and shuts the door.
text: Oliver is left shaking his head.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Terry shuts the door on the last guests. Ryan and Denise are
text: still zoning on the couch. Ryan scuttles closer to her.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Uh, uh. I call couch.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Big enough for both of us, right?
text: Denise shoves him onto the floor.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: I like my space.
text: Denise shoots Terry a ‘come hither’ glance. But he walks past
text: towards the windows and hits the CONTROL PANEL.
text: MRRV! The state of the art WINDOW BLINDS automatically close.

scene_heading: TITLE: DAY ONE - 3:50 A.M.
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The strange LIGHT streaks through the closed blinds.
text: Shadows dance over Elaine and Jarrod’s face.
text: She stirs.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: How’s it morning already?
text: He barely registers. Looks at the clock: 3:50 A.M.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: It’s not. It’s... jet lag.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: With the light glowing through the slits of the window
text: blinds, the building begins to SHAKE.
text: Candice doesn’t even look up.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: Earthquake?
text: Terry rolls over.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Probably just a tremor.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: A shirtless Ryan sits up from the shag. Even with the blinds
text: shut, it’s far brighter in here. Ryan nudges Denise awake.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hey, check it out.
text: She doesn’t care, turning over. But Ryan can’t let it go.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever seen anything like that?
text: He clicks a control panel, OPENING the PATIO DOOR BLINDS. The
text: LIGHT washes over his face in an almost ecstatic haze.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Turn off the lights...
text: She slowly turns back to see the DISTENDED VEINS stretching
text: across his back like a spiderweb.
speaker_heading: DENISE (CONT'D)
dialog: (Raising her voice)
dialog: Ryan... oh my God...
text: He slides OPEN THE DOOR, flooding the room in radiance.
text: Denise instinctively shields her eyes, backing away.
speaker_heading: DENISE (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you-
text: WHOMP. WHOMP. The FREQUENCY fills the air. A haunting melody.
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
text: Ryan steps outside. Soaked in sweat. Muscles twitching.
text: ON THE NEIGHBORING BUILDING
text: Other PEOPLE stand in the same hypnotized state, staring with
text: blackened pupils at
speaker_heading: AN INCANDESCENT SPHERE
text: Hovering twenty feet in the air above Lincoln Blvd. It pulses
text: with energy, flowing out from its center. Beautiful.
text: Tempting. Beckoning everyone near like a lucent SIREN.
scene_heading: EXT. MAXELLA AVENUE - CONTINUOUS
text: An OLDER COUPLE exits their car, parked in the middle of the
text: road. They move towards the light, completely entranced.
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Ryan presses against the railing, his body trembling.
text: BAMPF! In the blink of eye, he’s gone. Vanished into thin
text: air.
speaker_heading: DENISE (0.S.)
dialog: Ryan!
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jarrod bursts into the room.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: He’s gone!
text: Turning to his left, Jarrod looks out through the open
text: BALCONY DOOR. The brilliant light washes over him.
speaker_heading: DENISE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jarrod, no!
text: Denise grabs Jarrod by the arm.
text: Terry charges across the living room to see his friend, veins
text: bulging, eyes fully dilated.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What the hell’s going on?
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Stop him-
text: Jarrod tears away from Denise.
text: The FREQUENCY drowns everything out as Jarrod moves forward,
text: finally stepping outside, SIREN LIGHT FLARING OVER HIM.
text: But he’s pulled back in by Terry.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What’s with you man?
text: Jarrod pushes forward. Twice as strong. Terry gasps. It takes
text: everything he’s got to hold Jarrod back.
text: Elaine emerges, rushing towards them.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Jarrod?
text: But Denise wraps her arms around Elaine, holding her back.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Don't!
text: Terry wrestles Jarrod down to the floor, into the shadows of
text: the upward arcing light.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What the...
text: Elaine looks out to see the hint of
text: OBJECTS FLYING UPWARDS THROUGH THE AIR
text: Suddenly the lights die down. The tremors stop.
text: Everything goes quiet.
text: Jarrod stops writhing. Terry eases up. Catching his breath.
text: Elaine and Denise still hold each other.
dialog: No one knows what to say.
speaker_heading: CANDICE (0.S.)
dialog: (Annoyed)
dialog: Are you guys fucking serious?
text: Candice walks out to see:
text: Terry lying over Jarrod. His veins bulging, covered in sweat,
text: breathing like he just ran a marathon.
speaker_heading: CANDICE (CONT’D)
dialog: (Shocked)
dialog: Oh my God, what’s wrong with him?
text: Elaine pushes Terry out of the way, jumping to Jarrod’s aid.
text: His eyes are squeezed shut, jaw clenched.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: It’s okay. I’m right here.
text: He finally eases up, looking back like he’s blind.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jarrod? Baby, can you see me?
text: He shakes his head, everything is a blur. Still trying to
text: catch his breath.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: What happened?
text: Terry looks out the balcony door. It’s dark now. Hazy.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Please, please be-
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I’m... I’m okay.
dialog: 24.
text: Jarrod sits up, shaking it off. Finally stares into Elaine’s
text: tortured face. She burrows into him, holding him tight.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Where’s Ryan?
text: Terry steps out onto the patio.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: No! Don’t!
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
text: There’s a thick HAZE in the air. He can barely see the street
text: lights below.
text: Denise rushes out and pulls on Terry. Imploring.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Please! Come back inside!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Where'd that light come from?
text: She grunts, forcing him back in.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINOUS
text: Denise slams the door shut behind them. Closes the blinds.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You better start making some sense-
text: Denise’s hand on Terry's chest. Candice glares at them.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Ryan... went out there. To the
dialog: light. And... he just. Disappeared.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: Somebody's had a little too much to
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Then explain what happened to him.
text: Jarrod looks up, still disoriented.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Jarrod, man, what did you see?
dialog: 25.
text: Jarrod stands up, gathering his thoughts. He speaks softly in
text: a measured and haunted tone.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: It was... like I was flying. Towards
dialog: this shimmering light.... But I'd
dialog: never seen the color before.
text: He looks away from Elaine’s gaze.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: It was beautiful.
text: ROAR! An ungodly growl ECHOES from the base of the building.
text: Everyone is shocked. Standing still for a moment.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What in the hell was that?
text: Terry walks to the windows. Looks through a crack in the
text: blinds. Can't see anything. Turns to the TELESCOPE.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Jarrod)
dialog: Give me a hand.
text: Jarrod helps Terry position the telescope through the corner
text: crack in the blinds.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Wait, stop for-
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No, you stop! Nothing makes any
dialog: sense. We have to know what’s what.
text: Denise is rattled, but she stops protesting.
text: Candice DIALS 911 on her blackberry. Holds the phone to her
text: ears, listening to it ring. Over and over again.
text: Terry changes the input on the TV, broadcasting the
text: Telescope’s LIVE FEED onto the Big Screen.
text: Elaine moves behind Jarrod, puts an arm on his shoulder. He
text: looks into her eyes, nodding. He mans the Telescope.
text: TELESCOPE POV: Panning across the skyline - It’s still hazy,
text: making it hard to see anyone or anything outside.
text: Everyone watches in rapt silence, not sure what to expect.
dialog: 26.
text: TELESCOPE POV: SMOKE PLUMES on the horizon. Eerily calm.
text: There are several ABANDONED CARS in the middle of the Lincoln
text: Blvd. Then. A HULKING SHADOW tears through the intersection.
text: Jarrod pulls away.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: There’s something down there. On
dialog: the street...
text: Terry shakes his head. Still skeptical, he gets behind the
text: telescope, panning around.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I don’t see anything.
text: TELESCOPE POV: He pans up to the neighboring ROOFTOP where a
text: group of RESIDENTS point and look off in the other direction.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait, there’s people...
text: Turns back to the group. Points at the neighboring building.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
text: On the roof.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: What are they doing?
text: Terry struggles with the Telescope. Scanning over.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Can’t tell. But we should check it
dialog: out.
text: Steps away from the telescope.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go to the roof.
text: His words hang there for a moment. Jarrod looks down.
dialog: No one likes the idea, especially Denise.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, Jarrod.
text: Jarrod hesitates. Looks to Elaine then Terry.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Yeah. Okay.
text: Terry nods, walks off to the MASTER BEDROOM.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: I can’t believe you’re all just
dialog: ignoring me...
text: Denise begins CRYING. Elaine comforts her.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Jarrod, you can’t go out there.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I can’t let him go alone.
text: Terry returns holding a GLOCK HANDGUN, making Elaine nervous.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: A gun?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Just to be safe.
text: Elaine throws up her arms.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: (Dismissive)
dialog: Really?
text: Terry ignores her. Candice shakes her head. Dials 911 again.
text: Jarrod grabs Denise’s CAMERA off the counter. Looks through
text: the zoom lens. His gears are turning.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (To Jarrod)
dialog: Let's go.
text: Jarrod looks to Elaine. Tears in her eyes. He holds her face
text: in his hands. She hesitates, then kisses him.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Hurry back.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: The door slowly opens. Terry inches out. Gun drawn.
text: Jarrod follows. Camera around his neck.
text: Everything is quiet. They relax somewhat.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Stairs are this way.
text: They head down the hall.
text: Slowly creeping around the corner. Still not a sound.
text: RUFF! Terry spins around, gun raised to see:
text: An ELDERLY MAN stands in his doorway, holding his SMALL DOG.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: Whoa, whoa!
text: Terry lowers the gun.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Walt. God damn. Scared the hell out
dialog: of me man.
text: It’s Terry’s neighbor WALT and his BARKING dog MALCOLM.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: What’s going on? Did you hear that
dialog: noise? Is it Al Qaeda?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: We're going to check it out-
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Malcolm’s been going crazy and I-
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Listen just stay inside and keep
dialog: your blinds shut. We’1l be back,
dialog: okay?
text: Walt nods, closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. NORTH STAIRWELL —- DAWN
text: Terry leads the way up the fluorescent lit steps. Jarrod
text: looks over his shoulder, feeling edgy.
text: They reach the top of the stairs.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Wait up.
text: They stop beside the DOOR to the ROOF.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s the plan?
dialog: 29.
text: Terry adjusts his grip on the gun. Nerves catching up to him.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'll go first. Watch my back.
text: Jarrod nods. An understanding passes between them.
text: Terry takes a deep breath. Opens the DOOR.
text: LIGHT FLOODS OVER TERRY.
text: But it’s just the SUNRISE.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAWN
text: They emerge onto the industrial rooftop, facing WEST. They
text: can see all the way to the OCEAN past the Marina.
text: Jarrod moves forward, aims the CAMERA towards the coast.
text: Zooms in on the clear blue water. Snaps off a quick shot.
speaker_heading: JARROD
text: Looks calm...
text: SLAM! The door shuts behind them. Terry grabs the handle.
text: It’s locked.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Damn it Jarrod!?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: You never told me to hold it open.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I thought it was common sense!
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I'm sorry, I-
text: WHOMP. WHOMP. The FREQUENCY bellows through the air.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Get down!
text: They duck down.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: What now?
dialog: 30.
text: Terry motions with his head, the crouch forward towards the
text: stairwell to the HELIPAD.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAWN
text: Candice paces back and forth. Phone attached to her ear.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
text: Just keeps ringing.
text: Elaine nods, looking down at her iPhone - dialing her MOM
text: with similar results. She turns on the TV. It displays the
text: default “Acquiring Signal” graphic. Satellite interference.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Perfect.
text: Denise is curled up on the couch, searching on her iPhone.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: I've looked everywhere online. No
dialog: news since 4 AM.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What about Facebook, Twitter?
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: A few people... All asking the same
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Someone has to know about this.
text: Elaine stands before the Telescope. Takes a deep breath.
text: TELESCOPE POV: She passes over a neighborhood in the
text: distance. Hundreds of flailing SHADOWS rise from the ground.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God...
text: Shocked, she turns and darts towards the front door.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HELIPAD STAIRWELL - DAWN
text: Terry and Jarrod slowly moving up the last steps.
dialog: 31.
text: On the neighboring building’s ROOFTOP they can see FIVE
text: RESIDENTS staring off at the city in the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. HELIPAD - DAWN
text: They reach the helipad. Following the neighbors’ gazes to
dialog: see:
text: The HAZE is clearing, offering a sprawling view of the
text: skyline stretching out before them.
text: With mouths agape, they see some forty blocks away:
text: TINY SPECKS RISE UP into the air - spiralling upwards into
text: the CLOUDS above.
text: Then breaking forth from the cloud cover, half the distance
dialog: away, they see:
text: A SHIP. MASSIVE. OTHERWORLDLY. A NIGHTMARE.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What. The. Fuck.
text: A quarter mile wide. Like a single cell organism on an epic
text: scale. It hovers in the air with pure, unadulterated menace.
text: Beyond that even more SHIPS become visible. DOZENS of them
text: loom over the entire city.
text: WHOMP. WHOMP. The FREQUENCY sounds. From the bottom of the
text: nearest SHIP the INCANDESCENT SPHERE lowers, softly drifting
text: towards the ground before emitting the SIREN LIGHT.
text: Jarrod shields his eyes.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Don’t look at it man!
text: Terry ignores him, staring out at the horrible spectacle.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn it Terry!
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That shit’s over a mile away.
text: Jarrod unblocks his eyes to see Terry’s right. He looks out
dialog: at the ship.
text: Suddenly they see a SWARM rising through the air. Jarrod
text: raises the camera to his eyes. Zooms in. Focuses.
dialog: 32.
text: IT’S PEOPLE.
text: Everyone in a three block radius of the SIREN is sucked into
text: the ship by a vacuum force.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: That what I think it is?!
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: My God...
text: They stand there is stunned silence, watching the human
text: population being vacuumed off the face of the Earth.
text: When it’s done a HAZE of DEBRIS fills the air under the SHIP.
text: Jarrod scans the ship with the ZOOM lens, clicking away.
text: Stops. Sees something. Lowers the lens.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What?
text: Jarrod begins backing away.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Run.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: JUST RUN!
text: Jarrod and Terry tear ass across the Helipad.
dialog: In the SKY ABOVE:
text: DOZENS of DRAGON-LIKE SHIPS, around the size of fighter jets,
text: begin launching off the MOTHERSHIP. They are the HYDRA.
text: One HYDRA heads directly towards them.
scene_heading: EXT. HELIPAD STAIRWELL - DAY
text: Terry and Jarrod jump down the steps, adrenaline on
text: overdrive.
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
text: They stumble towards the locked door. Working together, they
dialog: try to pull it open. No dice.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Back up, back up!
text: Terry raises his gun. Aims at the lock. BOOM! BOOM!
text: Jarrod tears at the handle. But it doesn’t budge.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Damn it!
text: The HYDRA ship rounds the building, it’s surface is a
text: horrific meld of living tissue and metallic structuring. It
text: makes quick work of the NEIGHBORS of the adjacent rooftop.
text: BOOM! Terry shoots the lock again. Still won’t open.
text: A bright SIREN SPOTLIGHT hits them. They shield their eyes as
text: the HYDRA lowers down towards their roof.
text: In a last gasp, they both pull frantically at the door.
text: Giving it all they got. Nothing. Jarrod sinks to the ground.
text: Terry and Jarrod share a look. Preparing for the end.
text: CREAK. The door swings opens. ELAINE stands before them.
text: She looks into the SPOTLIGHT of the oncoming HYDRA. Veins
text: immediately bulge across her body. She steps towards it.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: No!
text: He jumps to his feet, pulling her away as Terry slams the
text: door shut behind them.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: They burst through the front door. A shaking Jarrod lays
text: Elaine down. She writhes in his arms, slowly coming back to
dialog: consciousness.
text: Denise rushes to help. Holding Elaine’s head up.
text: Terry runs to the freezer, pulls out a bag of ice. Jarrod
text: applies it to Elaine’s forehead. His hands tremble.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: (Clenched jaw)
dialog: Come on baby...
text: She looks up. Her pupils slowly return to normal size. Color
text: comes back to her cheeks.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
text: My head feels like it’s on fire.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: (Breathing deeply)
dialog: I know. It’1ll pass. I promise.
text: She grabs hold of her stomach. Jarrod looks down and places
text: his hand over hers. Her eyes widen as she stares at his ARM.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You looked again?
text: Jarrod sees the VEINS on his arms are BULGING as well.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: But how...?
text: Jarrod doesn’t know what to say.
text: An oblivious Denise lets out a huge sigh of relief.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: What happened up there?!
text: No one answers. Terry rubs his nose anxiously.
text: Jarrod finally hands the CAMERA over to Denise.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: See for yourself.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINING AREA - LATER
text: Elaine sits huddled next to Jarrod as Candice and Denise
text: scrub through the PHOTOS on her CAMERA’S LCD DISPLAY.
text: Terry paces back and forth. Eyes determined.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Oh my God...
text: They stare at a close up of a WOMAN flying through the air.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: All of those people...
text: The next photo shows the SHIP swallowing entire columns of
text: humans. Elaine stares at it hard.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: What do they do with them?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I’m not looking to find out.
text: Candice takes the camera from Denise. Begins scrolling
text: through the photos.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: I can’t believe... I mean, how?
speaker_heading: JARROD
text: Once you look... it grabs hold.
dialog: Like it...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Controls you.
text: Elaine and Jarrod lock eyes. Putting things together.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Who wouldn’t stare at something so
dialog: beautiful? Then...
text: Terry doesn’t like the sound of it.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s kind of genius actually.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, fucking brilliant.
text: Everyone turns to stare at Terry. His eyes wide. Perspiring.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: At least I’m trying to piece it
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Who cares? We need to worry about
dialog: saving ourselves.
text: Jarrod stands up, moving between them.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: So what are we going to do?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What do you mean?
text: Terry heads for the front door.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I got an idea.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Check on my neighbor Walt.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Don’t sweat it, I'll be right back.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Terry-—
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I can handle it.
text: Opens the door slowly.
speaker_heading: TERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Just be cool. And stay quiet.
text: Terry leaves. And it is quiet for a moment.
text: Elaine sighs and moves towards the...
scene_heading: INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: Elaine puts on her sweater. Her hands rest on her stomach for
text: a moment. Concern on her face. She heads to the door.
text: She stops. BZZZ. BZ2ZZ.
text: Elaine's eyes widen. She pulls her iPhone out of her pocket.
text: The display reads MOM. She picks up.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Mom?
text: A FEMALE VOICE answers. Bad connection. Cutting in and out.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: MOM (V.O.)
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: Elaine!
text: Elaine is overwhelmed with joy.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Yeah mom. It’s me. Are you okay?
speaker_heading: MOM (V.O.)
dialog: I saw them... I saw. Everybody's
dialog: gone! They’re all gone!
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Mom, please listen to me, you have
dialog: to stay inside!
speaker_heading: MOM (V.O.)
dialog: I am inside.
text: WHOMP. WHOMP. The frequency begins to fade in over the phone.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Mom!!!
text: Elaine hears her mother’s BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM!
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom?
text: Elaine pulls the phone away from her ear.
text: After a moment, the frequency begins to fade.
text: Elaine is shaking. She puts her ear to the phone and listens.
text: It’s not disconnected. Just nobody on the other end.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Mom?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Mom!
text: She throws her phone against the wall in anger.
text: Jarrod storms into the room, rushing over to her.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Baby, you have to quiet down-
text: She pushes him away. Emotions overwhelming her.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: They took my mother!
text: Jarrod stares into her eyes. Steps towards her again.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I'm sorry-
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: They took her...
text: She walks away. Inconsolable.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Terry stands outside of Walt’s FRONT DOOR. Quietly KNOCKS.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (Whispers)
dialog: Walt... Yo Walt, open up!
text: No answer... He KNOCKS. A little louder this time. Nothing.
text: Looks at the DOORBELL. Thinks about pressing it. Almost does.
text: But on second thought he tries the HANDLE. IT’S UNLOCKED.
scene_heading: INT. WALT’S APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY
text: Terry slowly steps inside.
text: There’s an eerie WHISTLING drifting in from the living room.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Walt?
text: No answer.
text: Terry takes out his gun. Slowly moves into the:
scene_heading: INT. WALT’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY
text: It’s a corner unit with an open layout. From here, he can see
text: the entire living room.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Anybody here?
text: The PATIO DOOR is cracked open. The whistling is nothing more
text: than a busted wind chime.
text: He sighs. Goes to the kitchen counter. Checks the key rack.
text: Finds a MERCEDES key. Pockets it.
speaker_heading: WALT (0.S.)
dialog: (Whispered)
dialog: You at least gonna ask?
text: A stunned Terry looks to see Walt hiding behind the counter
text: with his WHIMPERING dog Malcolm.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Jesus! Man, don’t do that.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Listen, I got a plan but I need to
dialog: borrow your wheels.
text: Walt doesn’t seem too sure.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: I don’t know-
text: VROOSH! A strange noise echoes from OUTSIDE.
text: RUFF! RUFF! Malcolm barks out.
speaker_heading: WALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Quiet boy!
text: IN THE LIVING ROOM
text: Through the windows: something RISES UP OUTSIDE the building.
text: THE HYDRA SHIP. Humming in the air above the patio.
text: ITS SIREN LIGHT FLOODS INTO THE
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: Walt pulls Terry down behind the counter as the lights wash
text: over the room.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: SOMETHING around the size of a phone booth detaches from the
text: ship. Hovers onto the patio. Pulsing with ENERGY.
text: The patio door slides open.
text: BACK IN THE KITCHEN
text: Walt, with his hands clamped around Malcolm’s mouth looks
text: around the corner.
text: Terry stays deathly still. Grips his gun tightly.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: IT hovers past the furniture. Completely stealth.
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: Terry looks at Walt and his dog, then the front door.
text: Psyching himself up.
text: But everything is quiet. For a long stretch.
text: Walt turns back to Terry.

speaker_heading: WIFE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: WIFE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please. Please. You. Have. To...
text: The HUM drowns her out. The DRONE bears down on them.
text: Jarrod shields Elaine. Candice and the Wife cower. Eyes shut.

dialog: You alright?
text: Everyone is speechless. Elaine notices Jarrod’s condition.

speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I’m okay.

speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: No!
text: She pulls at her husband’s arms as his BRAIN is RIPPED OUT.
text: His lifeless remains fall before her feet.
text: The tendril takes the brain and retreats into the Drone’s
text: womb. Almost instantly it SCREAMS, violently lashing back to
text: life. Limbs cracking into place as it begins REBUILDING

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Run!
text: Candice leads as the group tears ass around the patio.
text: The Tanker REARS UP on its hind legs, bellowing an awful WAR

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You can make it!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I can’t!
text: The Tanker gallops onto to the pool deck, his claw splashing

text: The Wife looks back. Terrified. Oliver yanks her arm.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Come on!
text: The Tanker spots the Wife. Extends its CLAW.
text: THE TENDRILS launch, ensnaring her.

text: Candice leads the group through a SUNKEN CONCRETE WALKWAY,
text: eight feet below the pool area.
text: The BACK DOORWAY is up ahead. Almost there.
text: CRASH! The TANKER BARRELS over the group running on the

speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: No!
text: The second Tanker charges them. Oliver reaches the door.

text: The tanker is 10 yards away.
text: Oliver swipes another FOB. No dice.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: Open the fucking door-

text: They explode through, spilling out onto the ground.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Hurry!
text: Everyone piles through after them.
text: Oliver SLAMS it shut.

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I’m so sorry...

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JARROD

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: We stay here. Safest place I can

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: He’s right. Somebody has to... This

dialog: smoke is more than reasonable.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I never said-
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: From the moment you stepped foot in
dialog: here, you've been a total drag-
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: And you've been a total bitch!
text: Jarrod puts his arm around Elaine.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Baby, it’s okay.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: Why don’t you leave then?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Stop it Candice.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: What’s wrong with you people?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I’m pregnant, alright?
text: Candice exhales. Realization hitting her.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Between all of... the stress...
dialog: and... I just thought smoke is the
dialog: last thing...
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I know. It’s okay.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I... never even got to tell my mom.
text: Oliver watches them intently. Visibly moved. A puff of smoke
text: passes his face. He turns to see Candice taking another drag.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Put out the cigarette!
text: Rattled, Candice stamps her smoke out in a decorative bowl.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Elaine)
dialog: You okay dear?
text: Elaine slowly nods.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on Boss. Let the girls sleep.
dialog: We'll keep watch.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Both of us?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: If they try that light stuff, we
dialog: got each other’s back.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: (to Elaine)
dialog: Try to get some rest. I'll be right
dialog: over there.
text: Elaine nods. Lays down. Jarrod kisses her softly.
text: He walks to the telescope with Oliver.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (To herself)
dialog: I fucking hate L.A.
text: Elaine looks across the couch to a tear stained Candice.
text: Elaine sighs and takes a blanket over to her.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: I’m sorry... I didn’t know-
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: It’s okay. I didn’t really either.
text: They share a smile. Then lie down on opposite ends of the
dialog: couch.
text: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT
text: They sit in darkness. Not wanting to attract attention.
text: Oliver scans with the telescope.
text: Jarrod is behind him, leaning on the fire place wall. He's
text: penciling on a SKETCH PAD in his lap.
text: They speak in hushed voices.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
text: It’s quiet now.
text: Oliver is still glued to the telescope.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe the worst is over.
dialog: 63.
text: TELESCOPE POV: Nothing stirs on the streets. Faint glows are
text: hidden by the clouds in the distance.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Maybe not.
text: He turns the pad, looking at it from another angle. It’s a
text: surreal picture of the SIREN LIGHT. Haunting. Beautiful.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think those things are?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I don’t know. Does it even matter?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Probably not.
dialog: (sighs)
text: It doesn’t even seem real.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well, it is real.
text: Oliver turns to Jarrod, sizing him up.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: And you better man up.
dialog: (he looks to Elaine)
dialog: For her.
dialog: (he looks to Jarrod)
dialog: For your baby.
text: Jarrod stops drawing, looks up.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: We don’t even know if, you know-
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: What are you blind? She’s decided.
text: Jarrod glances over towards Elaine’s sleeping figure.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: (Motions to the window)
dialog: All this makes it even more
dialog: important. Not gonna be many of us
text: left.
text: The words just hang there for a moment. Too true.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s the problem, with... kids
dialog: like you.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: You don’t know me.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You got everything... and you just
dialog: want to throw it all away.
dialog: (looks at Jarrod)
dialog: Too selfish to grow up.
text: Jarrod almost says something but stops. Lets it sink in.
text: Then goes back to drawing. Head down.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: What about you? You got kids?
text: Oliver doesn’t answer for a moment. A change comes over him.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (Pained)
dialog: I did. Wife too.
text: His looks down to the RING on his left hand.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: My world ended a long time ago.
text: Jarrod stops sketching. Starting to understand Oliver.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I... I’m sorry...
text: Oliver turns back to the telescope. Resuming his duty.
text: FADE TO.
scene_heading: TITLE: DAY TWO
scene_heading: EXT. MARINA - DAWN
text: The sun rises over the water, illuminating the wasted city
dialog: scape of Los Angeles.
speaker_heading: JARROD (0.S.)
dialog: Try looking to the left...
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAWN
text: Oliver pulls his sleep deprived eyes away from the Telescope.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Nothing.
text: Candice emerges from the kitchen, handing them each an
speaker_heading: ESPRESSO.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: You sure?
text: He nods.
text: Oliver accepts his with a smile, the irony of the moment not
dialog: lost on him.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Gracias.
text: He watches Candice walk over to the
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Elaine sits on the couch.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: Double espresso?
text: Elaine stares at her for a moment.
speaker_heading: CANDICE (CONT’D)
dialog: Just kidding.
text: They share a laugh.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: God forbid you ever get knocked up.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: (Nods with a smile)
dialog: I know. Everything I love is off
dialog: limits.
text: She takes a sip. Slowly realizing she probably never will.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
text: Jarrod stands in the doorway.
text: Over Terry's bed is a PAINTING of an angelic face on a black
text: background. Jarrod stares at it. Tears welling in his eyes.
dialog: 66.
text: Candice enters behind him. They exchange a look.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: This was the first one I ever sold.
text: Jarrod smiles.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: It was supposed to be a gift but he
dialog: insisted on paying for it.
text: Candice nods knowingly. Puts her hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: It was his favorite, you know.
text: Jarrod chokes up a little. Looks her in the eyes.
speaker_heading: CANDICE (CONT’D)
dialog: Terry could be such an asshole. But
dialog: I loved him. Everyone did.
text: They stand there for a moment. Looking at Jarrod’s painting.
dialog: WHOMP. WHOMP.
text: They turn, ducking down as a HYDRA whooshes past the
dialog: building.
text: Holding their breath. Watching intently. And then..
text: The HYDRA moves on. The sound of the FREQUENCY fades away.
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM/LOUNGE AREA - DAY TO NIGHT
text: TIME LAPSE: The group moves positions across the condo. From
text: the couch - to the telescope - the kitchen - bathrooms.
text: Bored. Tired. The fight literally draining from their bodies.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM/LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT
text: Elaine and Candice are splayed across the couch.
text: Jarrod lays across two chairs. Oliver sleeps on a seat before
dialog: the Telescope.
text: It’s completely silent. Almost peaceful. Then...
text: A FAINT BOOM is heard in the distance.
dialog: 67.
text: The building RATTLES a bit.
text: They wake with a start.
text: Jarrod and Oliver look around, listening.
text: MORE EXPLOSIONS sound off in the night.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Take a look!
text: Oliver puts his eye to the telescope.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I don’t see anything...
text: Jarrod picks up the remote to turn on the TV.
text: Elaine sits up from the couch.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I want to see what’s out there.
text: Oliver looks up.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
text: No. It’s too bright. Can’t risk it.
text: Jarrod looks to Oliver then Elaine. Puts down the remote.
text: Satisfied Oliver returns his eye to the Telescope.
text: TELESCOPE POV: Only FIRE and SMOKE followed by bursts of
text: light on the horizon.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: There!
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What’s happening?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Somebody's fighting back.
text: They all listen to the combat.
text: The EXPLOSIONS die down. The sound of one side losing. Badly.
text: Jarrod looks at Elaine. Concern growing on his face.
text: A few last BOOMS are extinguished, giving way to...
dialog: 68.
dialog: Silence.
text: FADE TO:
scene_heading: TITLE: DAY THREE
scene_heading: INT. GUEST BATHROOM - DAWN
text: Jarrod turns the faucet. No water comes out. He tries the
dialog: toilet. Nothing.
text: Frustrated, he looks into the mirror. Stubble over grown.
text: Bags under his eyes. His stare grows focused. Determined.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Everyone assumes their positions. Oliver at the telescope.
text: Candice on the couch. Elaine by the fireplace.
text: Only Jarrod paces back and forth.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Why don’t you take a seat. Relax.
text: Jarrod shakes his head. Oliver sighs.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright. I’1l bite. What’s your
dialog: plan Boss? I know you’re dying to
dialog: tell me.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I don’t have a plan-
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Really? Nothing you want to say?
text: Jarrod looks over at Candice and Elaine.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Look. We’re on a marina for
dialog: Christ’s sake.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I’ve noticed.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: So there are hundreds of boats just
text: across the street.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Remind me how that worked out last
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: JARROD
text: We go on foot. Quietly.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: And search every boat until we find
dialog: a key? That’s great plan Jarrod.
text: Elaine stands up. Not liking where this is going.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I can’t believe you'd even suggest
dialog: this after what happened.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: You make it sound like it was my
dialog: fault.
text: It hangs in the air. Maybe it was?
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I was practically begging. But you
dialog: wouldn't listen to me.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: And you think Terry would have
dialog: listened to me?
text: Candice looks at him with hurt eyes. Elaine backs off.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Alright. Let’s say you make it out
text: the building. Across to the Marina.
text: Down to the dock. We find a boat
dialog: and everything... Then what?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Then we get the hell out of Dodge.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: To where? Catalina? Down the coast?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Anywhere is better than here.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: How do you know? We’re here and
dialog: we're still alive.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: I guess I have faith, Oliver.
dialog: Thought you might understand that.
text: Whether it’s intended as a mock, Oliver takes it as such.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Listen to me you little punk-
text: VRRROOSH! A sonic boom echoes from outside.
text: The sound of something FLYING OVERHEAD. And fast.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What was that?
text: Oliver hustles to the TELESCOPE. He pans across the sky,
text: struggling to find the source of the sound.
text: Jarrod picks up the remote. Looks at Elaine. She doesn’t
text: protest this time. He turns on the TV. Everyone watches the
text: telescope feed on the screen to see:
text: MILITARY PREDATOR DRONES.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Hallelujah.
text: A whole squadron of PREDATORS, flying over the city towards
text: the MOTHERSHIP.
text: WHOMP. WHOMP. The Frequency sounds.
text: The PREDATORS are quickly inundated with SIREN LIGHTS but
dialog: they just keep coming.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
text: The light... it’s not stopping
dialog: them...
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: They’re unmanned.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: It’s about time.
text: Oliver pans the telescope over.
text: Everyone GASPS.
text: HUNDREDS OF HYDRA ships swarm, blotting out the sky.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Oh... shit.
dialog: 71.
text: It’s not a dogfight. It’s a massacre. The HYDRA don’t shoot
text: any projectiles. They KAMIKAZE into each Predator Drone.
text: EXPLOSIONS scatter across the sky. One by one the Predators
text: are dive bombed by the Hydra.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: No, no, no!
text: Oliver whips the telescope back and forth following the
text: action with a growing sense of horror. His hopes and prayers
text: unraveling before his very eyes.
text: He centers on the SOLE REMAINING PREDATOR as it weaves
text: through an endless sea of Hydra ships.
text: Everyone holds their breath.
dialog: Bobbing. Weaving.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, come on...
text: But it can only last for so long. A wave of Hydra engulf him.
text: The Predator cheats death for a second longer. Launches a
dialog: MISSILE before...
text: BOOM! The Predator explodes in a burst of black smoke.
text: Oliver struggles with the focus trying to follow the Missile
text: as it HITS THE MOTHERSHIP over DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES.
text: FLASH. Everything blows out to WHITE.
text: The TV DIES. THE POWER GOES OUT. Nuclear EMP.
text: Oliver looks away, stunned. Dives to the floor.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Everybody down!
text: The HEAT WAVE rips across the city.
text: The building SHAKES VIOLENTLY.
text: ONE of the WINDOW BLINDS FALLS to the floor, exposing them
dialog: for the first time.
text: Everyone else ducks down. The howling wind is deafening.
text: Jarrod and Elaine make eye contact, expecting the worst.
text: Then, the shaking stops.
dialog: 72.
text: Jarrod rushes to the exposed window.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Jarrod!
text: He stops short, looks back at her. Slowly peers around to see
text: the MUSHROOM CLOUD over DOWNTOWN. The Westchester BLUFFS
text: shielded them from the brunt of the blast.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Oh my God...
text: The MOTHERSHIP spiral through the air, across the entire
text: skyline before CRASHING into Culver City 4 miles away.
text: Oliver scans the wreckage with the telescope.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It... It worked.
text: He turns to Elaine. She hugs Oliver. Jarrod takes note.
text: Elaine looks for herself. Sure enough the Ship is down.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I don’t believe it.
text: Turns to Jarrod and Candice.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to see?
text: Tears of joy well up in Candice’s eyes. She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: I‘1l take your word for it.
text: Jarrod steps between Oliver and Elaine.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: You mind?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: By all means Boss.
text: Oliver moves out of the way.
text: Jarrod looks through the Telescope.
text: Oliver and Elaine exchange hopeful looks.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Do you think there’s more where
dialog: those guys came from?
dialog: 73.
text: For a long beat Jarrod pans across the wreckage.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Sure. Now they know what to do.
text: Jarrod stops on the downed ship. Adjust the focus. Sighs.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Shouldn’t be long before help-
text: Jarrod pulls his head away. A look of deep loss on his face.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Are you alright?
text: Jarrod just shakes his head.
text: A concerned Oliver bends over to peer through the scope.
text: TELESCOPE POV: The MOTHERSHIP is strewn across the hills
text: with HUNDREDS OF TANKERS, HYDRAS, and DRONES spilling from
text: its fractured HULL.
speaker_heading: ELAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: What... what is it?
text: Jarrod looks at her.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: They’re not dead.
text: TELESCOPE POV: HUNDREDS OF THEM move in a murderous WAVE of
text: destruction down the hill, SWARMING across the city, right
text: towards them.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: Just really, really pissed off.
text: TELESCOPE POV: Oliver pans back to the crashed ship to see
text: SOMETHING rising from the wreckage.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Something’s happening...
text: TELESCOPE POV: A darker, mysterious LIGHT pulses above the
text: ship. A strange energy fills the air. The ship’s DEBRIS
text: suddenly RISES UP, spinning around the SIREN in a zero
dialog: gravity centrifugal vortex as:
text: THE SHIP BEGINS TO REBUILD ITSELF.
text: Oliver takes a deep, labored breath. Like the hope is sucked
text: out of him. Doesn’t know what to say. Then...
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: We.... We have to block the window.
text: But Jarrod can see the resurgent ship through the window
text: clear as day. Elaine looks back at Jarrod. Fear in her eyes.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. Come on, help me with this.
text: Oliver grabs a stool from the kitchen. Begins trying to
text: reattached the blinds. But Jarrod just walks away.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Get back here!
text: Candice rushes over to help Oliver attach a blanket.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: Jarrod packs his duffel bag.
text: Elaine enters, devastated from the totality of the situation.
text: She watches him packing her things into his bag as well.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (Frightened)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: He stops, looks up at her.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: The only thing we can do.
text: He walks past her into the:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Jarrod walks out, bag in hand. Elaine follows.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (0.S.)
dialog: Going somewhere?
text: Candice and Oliver join them. Oliver is covered in sweat. The
text: exposed window is now covered by a BLANKET.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Those things are coming for us.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: And you're going to run away?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: I’m not going anywhere.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: We stay here. We hold up. For good.
text: Elaine nods. Jarrod turns to her.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: So now he gets to decide? We have
dialog: no water, no power-—
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: But you saw what’s out there-
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Yeah, and I’d rather make a run for
dialog: it than stay in a twenty story
dialog: target. Between those things and
dialog: the radiation, we are dead up here.
text: Elaine looks to Oliver then back to Jarrod. Uncertainty on
text: her face.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I don't-
text: A RUMBLING SOUND reverberates from outside the windows.
text: Everyone stops in their tracks. The sound grows louder.
text: Jarrod moves towards the windows. Follows the sound into the
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
text: From here he can hear the whirling blades. Then, through a
text: crack in the blinds, he sees
speaker_heading: A BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER
text: Touching down on the neighboring roof of the REGATTA
text: BUILDING.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Get in here!
text: He pulls the blinds back, peeking around to make sure the
dialog: coast is clear.
text: Elaine, Oliver, and Candice enter the room.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: Look...
dialog: 76.
text: On the REGATTA ROOF:
text: THREE SOLDIERS, with thermal goggles and gas masks, armed to
text: the teeth, emerge from the CHOPPER.
text: Jarrod goes to open the MASTER PATIO DOOR. Oliver grabs the
text: handle.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: What the hell do you think you’re
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: We got to let ‘em know we’re here.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You'll let everything know. We
dialog: can’t attract any attention.
text: Jarrod looks to Elaine, uncertainly on her face.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: You've been saying to wait for
dialog: help. Well, help is here-
text: He tries to push past Oliver but he won’t budge.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Does that look like a rescue
dialog: chopper to you? Don’t you get it?
dialog: This is a war.
text: They stare each other down.
speaker_heading: CANDICE (0.S.)
dialog: Where are they going?
text: They turn to look across as the Chopper RISES UP, taking
text: flight. Jarrod watches in vain before spotting...
text: The THREE SOLDIERS quickly and efficiently move across the
text: rooftop into spotting positions.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: They’1l be back for them. Come on,
dialog: we have to hurry.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Jarrod moves across the living room. Gathers his stuff.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: We'll go to the roof. Get them to
dialog: pick us up.
text: Candice shakes her head. Elaine isn’t sure anymore.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: What if they don’t come back?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Elaine-
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Look what happened to those planes.
dialog: What good is a helicopter?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: We have to take that chance.
text: Oliver steps towards Jarrod.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You can’t make that choice.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Seriously, just back off. We're
dialog: going.
text: The BLANKET BLIND falls from the window.
text: Outside they see the still REBUILDING MOTHERSHIP is now
text: HALFWAY COMPLETE - its massive shadow looming over the city.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: Shit!
text: Candice runs over. Struggles to reattach the blanket.
text: Oliver looks to the exposed window, pissed off, then back to
dialog: Jarrod.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You just gonna stand there?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: What do we do when the other blinds
dialog: fall? We don’t have enough bed
text: sheets.
text: Jarrod steps forward, GRABBING Elaine by the arm.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 78.
text: She pulls her arm away. Holds her stomach.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: How can you be so sure?
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Baby-
text: Jarrod goes to grab Elaine’s arm again.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Stop!
text: Oliver steps in between them.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You heard the lady.
text: Jarrod looks to Oliver in disbelief. Turns to Elaine.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: She’s not going anywhere.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: That’s not up to you.
text: He pushes past Oliver towards Elaine. Oliver pushes back.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Stop it, both of you!
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I’m not gonna let you put her in
dialog: danger. Not in her condition.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: This isn’t your family!
text: Oliver BACKHANDS him across the face.
text: Jarrod touches his lip. Reaches for Elaine again.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: Elaine, come on-
text: Oliver puts his hand on Jarrod’s chest. Jarrod SWINGS back,
text: cracking Oliver in the jaw. A nice punch but not a knock out.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: I said back off!
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Jarrod!
dialog: 79.
text: Oliver looks to Elaine.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It’s alright.
text: Jarrod looks to Oliver. Then defiantly steps to Elaine again.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Baby, we have to-
text: Oliver grabs Jarrod’s shirt. Delivers TWO crushing PUNCHES to
text: his face.
text: Jarrod falls to the ground. Oliver turns his back.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Stay down, Boss.
text: Jarrod groans. Doubled over in pain. He pulls himself up.
text: Elaine rushes to him but Oliver holds her back with his arm.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Get off of me!
text: Elaine beats her hands against his back.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I’m sorry, but it’s for the best.
text: Jarrod wipes his bloodied face. Stands up, unbalanced.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Let her go!
text: Oliver puts Elaine down. Raises his arms. Ready to brawl.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You just don’t get it, do you?
text: Jarrod stares Oliver down.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: You can hit me all you want.
text: Looks into Elaine’s eyes.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: But I’m not giving up on my family.
text: Jarrod lowers his fists, extending his arm out to Elaine.
text: A long pause as Jarrod stares into Elaine's eyes.
dialog: 80.
text: She looks back, seeing the boy she loves become a man.
text: In spite of all apprehension, she takes his hand.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I am with you.
text: He caresses her cheek. They embrace and kiss.
text: Oliver hangs his head.
text: Jarrod stares back at Oliver.
speaker_heading: CANDICE
dialog: (to Oliver)
dialog: You're just gonna let them leave?
text: Jarrod and Elaine run for the door. Jarrod tosses the
text: bookshelf out of the way. He swings the door open.
text: Looks back to Oliver one last time.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: They are making a choice.
dialog: (he nods to Jarrod)
dialog: Gotta respect that.
text: The doors shuts.
text: Oliver walks to the exposed window.
text: The almost complete MOTHERSHIP begins to rise upwards as the
text: plethora of CREATURES continue tearing across the city ina
text: wave of destruction. He pans back up to the SOLDIERS on the
text: neighboring rooftop.
text: He turns to Candice.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: How about that cigarette?
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - DAY
text: Emergency lights flash. Smoke fills the air.
text: A MUFFLED SMASH. Jarrod elbows the emergency glass.
text: Picks up a FIRE AXE.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 81.
text: They share a look. Elaine nods. They head up the steps.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
text: The door slowly opens. Jarrod peeks out. Followed by Elaine.
text: It's deceptively serene. But they can hear the sounds of
text: BATTLE off in the distance.
text: Jarrod grabs a BRICK to wedge the door open. Just in case.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Alright, just stay low and follow
dialog: me.
text: Elaine nods. Looks like she’s going to lose it. He gently
text: holds her face in his hands.

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Doesn’t matter. From now on...

speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Hey! Whoa! Easy!

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Please... We need help.
text: The Soldiers trade looks. One picks up his RADIO. Eyes
text: trained on Elaine. Calls something in but we can’t hear it.
text: The RADIO SQUAWKS back. Muffled conversation between the
text: Soldiers gives way to debate. All in MOS.
text: Accusations fly back and forth as TWO of the SOLDIERS STAND
text: OFF with each other, FINGERS POINTING.
text: CUT TO:
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BATHROOM - DAY

scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAY
text: TELESCOPE POV: Clumsily panning up along the building next
text: door’s rooftop. The SOLDIERS stand out in the open, an
text: ARGUMENT taking place between them. It’s getting heated.
text: Suddenly there’s a flash of movement.
text: Candice looks up, then back into the eye piece. She aims the
text: telescope over. Then stops. Twitches for a moment.
text: VEINS protrude across her body.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM/ CLOSET - DAY
text: Oliver exits the bathroom and stops. Turns to look into the
text: CLOSET. He walks inside.
text: It’s the size of his bedroom. Runs his hand along a custom
text: built rack of overpriced shoes. Shakes his head.
text: SSSD! He hears the sound of the PATIO DOOR sliding open.
scene_heading: EXT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Oliver runs out of the master bedroom to see:

text: He grabs her arm, pulling her back but:
text: She is VIOLENTLY RIPPED away from his grip.
text: Candice spirals out from the balcony, through the air, then:
text: SHE'S SWALLOWED into the pupas sac of a hovering DRONE.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: No!
text: The now full Drone rises upwards, flying off.
text: Oliver watches in despair when:

text: the RPG SOLDIER standing on the Regatta roof.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
text: Jarrod falls atop of Elaine, instinctively shielding her.
text: They share a look. Then slowly rise up.

speaker_heading: RPG SOLDIER
dialog: Stay down! They’re coming!
text: Jarrod and Elaine nod, looking up to see the BLACK HAWK
text: FLYING towards them from across the Marina.
text: Elaine allows herself to smile. Jarrod holds her tight.
text: The chopper BLADES WHIRL loudly as it angles between the two
text: buildings, heading towards the COVE’s helipad.
text: SNNRRT! Long and sinewy TENDRILS wrap around the Black Hawk.
dialog: 85.
text: A TANKER crests the roof of the Regatta with its outstretched
text: TENDRIL CLAW, holding the BLACK HAWK in mid air.
text: SNIPER FIRE rips into the Tanker as the SOLDIERS unload on
dialog: it.
text: BOOM! The RPG SOLDIER fires at the TANKER, knocking it to the
text: edge of the roof. It teeters there for a long tense moment...
text: The TANKER GROWLS! Grabbing the RPG SOLDIER with its other
text: claw before FALLING OFF the roof and RIPPING the Black Hawk
dialog: down with it.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: No!
text: Jarrod and Elaine watch helplessly as the CHOPPER FALLS...
text: All... the... way... down. It CRASHES hard into the ground.
text: A fireball rises upwards.
scene_heading: EXT. PENTHOUSE PATIO - DAY
text: Oliver looks down the crashed CHOPPER with hardened eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
text: The TWO Remaining Soldiers reload their weapons.
text: Elaine and Jarrod stand in shock for a moment.
text: Behind them, the now REBUILT MOTHERSHIP hovers towards them.
text: Before they can even process it, the building starts to SHAKE
speaker_heading: VIOLENTLY.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Jarrod!?
scene_heading: EXT. PENTHOUSE PATIO - DAY
text: The SHAKING throws Oliver against the railing.
text: CRASH. CRASH. The sounds growing louder...

text: ANOTHER TANKER IS CLIMBING UP THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING.
dialog: 86.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Come on!
text: They hustle back across the shaking roof.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM/LOUNGE AREA - SUNSET
text: Oliver stumbles into the rumbling condo as ALL of the WINDOW
text: BLINDS FALL DOWN exposing the entire view.
text: The SHADOW of the MOTHERSHIP envelops the entire landscape.
text: He clutches his cross. Resolve washing over him.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - SUNSET
text: Jarrod and Elaine hustle towards the ROOF DOOR when:
text: BOOM! BOOM! They look out to see an AIRCRAFT CARRIER on the
text: COAST LINE. Navy warships are fighting the Hydra.
text: The entire skyline is filled with the unfolding battle.
dialog: Our last stand.
text: But they don’t have time to watch.
text: Elaine opens the roof door to see:
text: THE SAVAGE DRONE from the garage - a long SCAR across its
text: body - moving right for them.
text: Elaine turns and slams the door but its TENDRIL slips through
text: the open crack, wrapping around her waist.
text: SIREN LIGHT seeps through the bullet holes as Jarrod and
text: Elaine push back against the door.
text: Jarrod slams the AXE down, chopping the TENDRIL off.
dialog: The Drone HOWLS!
text: Elaine throws the severed tendril to the ground.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: This way!
dialog: 87.
text: They turn and run back through the ventilation system.
text: The DRONE SMASHES through the doorway.
text: Its bleeding stump flails out, slithering over the SEVERED
text: TENDRIL. With a grotesque crunch, the tendril REATTACHES.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SUNSET
text: Oliver shuffles a CIGARETTE out of Candice’s pack.
text: Standing behind the stove counter top. He turns on the gas.
text: Holds the cigarette in his mouth. One last smoke.
text: Oliver lifts the LIGHTER to his face. About to spark it.
text: CRASH! The TANKER’S CLAW smashes through the WINDOWS. Its
text: massive TENDRIL sails right past Oliver’s head.
text: He falls back. The LIGHTER scatters across the floor.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP —- SUNSET
text: Jarrod and Elaine jump over steaming pipes and vents as the
text: DRONE gives chase.
text: Elaine's pants get caught on a vent. She stumbles.
text: The SIREN LIGHT flares through the STEAM.
text: Jarrod turns back to help her up. Ripping her pants loose.
text: They ROUND A CORNER to the front of the building.
text: THE MOTHERSHIP is CLOSING IN, almost right overhead.
text: Jarrod points to the Window Washer SCAFFOLDING held down by
text: cinder blocks.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Come on, it’s the only way down.
text: Jarrod begins kicking off the cinder blocks when:
text: VOOSH! A TENDRIL stabs right through his THIGH.
dialog: 88.
text: He SCREAMS in pain, falling back as the DRONE rounds the
text: corner. Elaine is on one side, Jarrod the other.
speaker_heading: JARROD (CONT'D)
dialog: Elaine run!
text: THE DRONE looms over Jarrod, its SIREN LIGHT floods him.
text: Jarrod is ENTRANCED. Eyes bloodshot. Veins bulging.
text: The TENDRIL ENVELOPS his head. Pulling him in.
text: Elaine looks to Jarrod, then the Drone. She’s had enough.
text: THUMP. She smashes the AXE into the DRONE’S HEAD. It lets out
dialog: a HOWL! Releasing Jarrod.
text: Elaine twists the handle, yanks the AXE back.
text: Embedded on the blade is a BRAIN MATTER. Nerve endings
text: dangling. All HUMAN in appearance.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Oh my God...
text: The dying DRONE whips its TENDRIL, knocking her back.
text: It pounces on top of her. It’s PUPAS SAC opening, trying to
text: swallow her inside.
text: The still entranced Jarrod trembles. Rises to his feet.
text: Overcoming everything, he pushes forward. The sight of his
text: woman in danger, sending him to another place.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: GET OFF HER!
text: Jarrod tackles the Drone off of Elaine, pinning it to the
text: ground. The Drone bores into Jarrod’s flesh but there’s no
text: stopping him.
text: Jarrod stares right into the SIREN LIGHT. Using the strength
text: against it. He TEARS at the DRONE’S FACE, ripping away its
text: eyes. BRUTALLY BREAKING it’s face apart with his bare hands.
text: SMASHING DOWN. Again and again.
text: Till there’s nothing but oil and goo beneath him.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN/ LIVING ROOM - SUNSET
text: The TANKER reaches through the windows, shaking everything.
dialog: 89.
text: Oliver crawls across the floor. Reaches for the LIGHTER. The
text: CUTLERY BLOCK falls to the ground, carving knives nearly
text: slicing off his fingers. He pulls back his hand. Close call.
text: SNAP! The Tanker’s TENDRIL wraps around his ankle, pulling
text: him across the floor.
text: Oliver is yanked through the living room, all the way against
text: the shattered windows.
text: At the last second, 50 CAL FIRE rips into the Tanker’s back
text: from the TWO SNIPERS on the Regatta Roof.
scene_heading: EXT. PENTHOUSE - SUNSET
text: The Tanker turns to look at the SNIPERS with FURIOUS EYES.
text: SNNNRT! Its TENDRILS WHIP across to the Regatta Roof -
text: debraining the FIRST SNIPER - then whipping the remains into
text: the SECOND, sending him FLYING off the roof.
text: His SCREAMS drown out as he falls to the city below.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN/ LIVING ROOM - SUNSET
text: Oliver stretches to grip a CARVING KNIFE. Stabs it through
text: the TANKER’S TENDRIL. It HISSES.
text: Oliver turns and runs back through the living room. The
text: TANKER thrusts its arm after him.
text: THE CLAW stabs through Oliver’s TORSO, pinning him down.
text: With his last gasp, Oliver reaches out and grabs the LIGHTER.
text: Looks up at the ugly motherfucker.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Vaya con Dios, you son of a bitch-

text: The Tanker HOWLS! Engulfed in a burst of FLAMES.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP —- SUNSET
text: Jarrod and Elaine are knocked back by the EXPLOSION right

dialog: 90.
text: They hold on to each other tightly, watching helplessly as
text: the SCAFFOLDING FALLS OVER the edge.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: No!
text: Jarrod lunges forward. Elaine grabs him. Holds him in her
text: arms. Cuts all over his body. He struggles to catch his
text: breath, coming down from the rage of the entrancement.
text: Jarrod looks down at his leg. He’s bleeding pretty badly.
text: CRUNCH! The CLAW of the BURNT TANKER grips the roof's edge.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Get up!
text: She drags Jarrod to his feet.
text: The BURNT TANKER crests onto the roof. Charred flesh. Angry
dialog: as hell.
text: They run up the stairs to the:
speaker_heading: HELIPAD
text: Running across to the opposite end. Jarrod collapses. Face
text: white as a sheet.
text: The BURNT TANKER bears down on them.
text: WHOMP. WHOMP. The Frequency sounds from above.
text: Elaine looks up to see: THE MOTHERSHIP IS OVERHEAD.
text: A SQUADRON of FIGHTER JETS move towards it. But they too are
text: kamikazed by the Hydra - exploding in the sky above them.
text: SHRAPNEL RAINS DOWN ONTO THE HELIPAD.
text: Now it’s Elaine’s turn to shield Jarrod...
text: As the BURNT TANKER goes in for the kill...
text: SMASH! A DOWNED FIGHTER JET CRASHES right into the TANKER -
text: knocking it off the roof, plummeting to the cul de sac below.
text: Elaine opens her eyes. Surprised to still be alive.
text: She holds Jarrod in her arms. Life draining from his body.
speaker_heading: JARROD
dialog: Please Elaine... you have to go.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: I’m not going anywhere without you.
text: They embrace. Sharing a tender moment.
text: HOWL! Another TANKER crawls up the Regatta building to the
text: south. And another TANKER on the building to the north.
text: OFF THE COAST: The AIRCRAFT CARRIER sinks into the Pacific.
text: All the Fighter Jets are down.
dialog: Our last stand has failed.
dialog: There is no escape.
text: Elaine and Jarrod hold each other tight.
text: The incandescent SIREN SPHERE gently falls from the
text: MOTHERSHIP'S belly, descending towards them.
text: Time stands still for a moment.
text: It's harrowing. And beautiful.
text: They stare into each other's eyes.
text: A lifetime passing between them as they kiss.
text: Then... they look up into the SIREN.
text: The trance overcomes them. Veins protruding across their
text: bodies.
text: But they don’t let go of each other.
text: WHOOSH! They're pulled up together through the air.
text: Spiralling upwards over the building and the howling Tankers.
text: Over the decimated city of Los Angeles.
text: Up into the clouds as the SIREN light flares out the lens.
text: FADE TO:
scene_heading: TITLE: DAY FOUR...

scene_heading: EXT. PARIS - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. AGRA, INDIA - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. TOKYO - SUNSET
text: The once humming metropolis is now completely barren. Not a
text: creature stirring.
dialog: Human beings have been wiped off the face of the Earth.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: Then...
text: SCANNER POV: like 4D ultrasound meets x-ray vision, looking
text: down on some kind of strange CONVEYOR BELT.
text: HUMAN BODY after BODY passes through the scanner head first.
text: An assembly line.
text: We can see right through their skin, scanning over the brain,
text: then the organs, muscles, etc. They look like nothing more
dialog: than animals.
text: A familiar looking WOMAN passes through the scan. It passes
text: over her stomach to focus on a SECOND HEART BEAT.
dialog: She’s pregnant.
text: The conveyor belt STOPS.
text: Strange noises echo through the chamber. Shadows engulf her.
text: CUT TO:
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP
text: Of ELAINE’S EYES as they flutter open. She squints, still
text: reeling from the effects of the siren light.
text: Laying on her back, she tries to sit up. But she can’t move a
dialog: muscle.
text: Her eyes begin to focus on the strange biomechanical
text: environment. Everything pulses with energy, like the entire
dialog: ship is alive.
text: She recoils at the sight of:
text: HUNDREDS OF HEADLESS HUMAN BODIES. The wounds cauterized.
text: Then... a DOME HEADED BEING sits before her. A horrifying mix
text: of metal and musculature that we haven’t seen before.
text: A surgical INCISION cut through the center of its cranium.
text: Its large oval eyes are shut tightly.
text: Beside it, TENDRILS reach into a viscous TROUGH to retrieve a
text: HUMAN BRAIN with spinal nerve endings still attached.
text: The human nervous system is slowly inserted inside the
text: BEING’S CRANIUM. The TENDRIL seals the wound instantly.
text: The Being stirs. Looks up, opening its large humanoid EYES.
text: It tilts its head, considering her for moment.
text: The BEING turns and bounds across the chamber, murdering TWO
text: DRONES in its path.
text: It turns and stares at Elaine. She gasps in horror. Her eyes
text: widening in fear as the BEING LOOMS over her.
text: With two slashes she’s freed from her constraints.
text: She looks up, staring into its EYES.
text: The BEING bends down. Reaches out to gently caress her cheek.
