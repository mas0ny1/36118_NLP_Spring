scene_heading: INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- NIGHT
text: A wreck. Too small for all the people in here right now --
text: SAILORS sweeping off the table -- rough hands laying THE MAN
text: down --
text: THE CAPTAIN -- brutal and impatient -- watching from the

text: GIANCARLO tears through the clutter -- searching for a medical

speaker_heading: GIANCARLO
dialog: He needs a doctor.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't

speaker_heading: GIANCARLO
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: (to the rest of them)

scene_heading: INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAWN -- TIME CUTS
text: Transformed into a makeshift operating room. A light swings
text: overhead. THE MAN layed out across the table. Sounds -- groans --
text: words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages.
text: GIANCARLO playing doctor in a greasy kitchen apron. Cutting
text: away the clothes. Turning THE MAN on his side. Two bullet
text: wounds in the back. Probing them, judging them.
text: Now -- GIANCARLO with a flashlight in his teeth -- TINK --
text: TINK -- TINK -- bullet fragments falling into a washed-out
dialog: olive jar.
text: Now -- something catching GIANCARLO'S EYE -- A SCAR ON THE

dialog: You've been shot. I'm trying to help
dialog: you.
dialog: (we're trying to find
dialog: our voice --)
dialog: You were in the water. You've been
dialog: shot. It's okay now.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: Where am I?
speaker_heading: GIANCARLO
dialog: (switching to English)
dialog: You're American. I thought so. From
dialog: your teeth -- the dental work --
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: Where am I?
speaker_heading: GIANCARLO
dialog: You're on a boat. A fishing boat.
dialog: Italian flag. We're out of Vietri.
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: It's the cold that saved you. The
dialog: water. The wounds are clean. I'm not
text: a doctor, but the wounds, it looks
dialog: okay. It's clean.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: How did I get here?
speaker_heading: GIANCARLO
dialog: You we're lost at sea. They pulled
dialog: you out.
dialog: (we say nothing)
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: (still nothing)
dialog: You were shot -- two bullets -- in

scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN -- DAY
text: The Trawler plows through heavy seas.
scene_heading: INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAY
text: GIANCARLO is hunched over a desk -- tweezers and flashlight --
dialog: busy working at that strange plastic tube that came out of
text: THE MAN's hip.
text: THE MAN is bandaged. He's sitting up, and it must hurt like
text: hell, but physical pain is not the thing troubling him right
text: now. He's staring around the room -- at his body -- at the
text: walls -- haunted --
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: What if it doesn't come back?
speaker_heading: GIANCARLO
dialog: (still working that
dialog: tube)
dialog: I told you. You need to rest.
text: Silence. THE MAN can't rest. Too busy trying to make sense
dialog: of all this.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: I can read. I can read that sign on
dialog: the door. I can count. I can talk...
dialog: (focusing now --)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: GIANCARLO rummaging around -- finding a magnifying glass --
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: What is that?
text: INSERT -- MAGNIFIED POV -- a slip of plastic from the tube --

speaker_heading: GIANCARLO
dialog: It came from your hip. Under the

dialog: (turning back --)
dialog: You have a bank in Zurich.
dialog: (waiting)
dialog: You remember Zurich?
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: No.
text: GIANCARLO staring at him now. Different suddenly. Suspicious.
speaker_heading: GIANCARLO
dialog: Look, I'm just on this boat, okay?
dialog: I'm an engineer. Whatever this is,
dialog: it's not for me to be involved, okay?
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: I don't remember Zurich.
text: GIANCARLO pulls his pint. Takes a hit.
speaker_heading: GIANCARLO
dialog: (offering the bottle --)
dialog: You drink rum?
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT
text: THE MAN stands at the rail, staring out to sea. So lost. He
text: turns to head inside -- there, a surfcasting rod propped
text: against a locker.
text: THE MAN picks up the rod -- flips the bail -- traps the line --
text: now he's casting far out into the darkness. And for the first
text: time, he smiles.
scene_heading: INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT
text: A ratty old espresso machine. THE MAN standing there, staring
text: at the thing like it's a test. Then his hands begin to move --
text: trying to pack a grind -- trying to fit it in -- turning on
dialog: the steam and --
text: The whole thing explodes.
scene_heading: EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- DAY
text: THE MAN alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail. He's still
text: bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing
text: himself. Using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping
dialog: that it will hold some answer for him.
scene_heading: INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT
text: A chess board. Wooden pieces jumbled in a box. THE MAN
text: hesitates -- takes a black knight from the box -- lingers
text: for a moment -- and then places it on the board. He's off
text: and running. He knows this. Placing pieces faster and faster --
dialog: still setting it up, as we --
scene_heading: INT. FISHING BOAT HEAD -- NIGHT
text: One of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet. THE MAN standing
text: before a pitted, tarnished, cataract of a mirror. Staring at
dialog: himself.
text: And then he speaks.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: (in perfect French)
dialog: I don't know who I am. Do you know
dialog: who I am? Do have any idea who I am?
text: And then he stops. Blinks. Wipes away the perspiration just
text: beading on his forehead.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: (in perfect Dutch)
dialog: Tell me who I am. If you know who I
dialog: am, please stop fucking around and
dialog: tell me.
text: No answer. Just that face. His face. Who am I?
dialog: And what else is inside there?
scene_heading: EXT. FISHING BOAT -- DAY
text: SAILORS hauling in the nets. THE MAN -- still bandaged, but

scene_heading: EXT. ITALIAN COASTLINE -- DAWN
text: A small, colorful fishing village. The trawler motoring in.
scene_heading: INT. THE FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- SAME TIME
text: THE MAN buttoning up borrowed clothes. GIANCARLO pulling

speaker_heading: GIANCARLO
dialog: (offering the money)
dialog: It's not much, but it should get you

speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: I won't forget this.

speaker_heading: TICKET AGENT
dialog: Una sola via?
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: Si. One way. Una sola via.
scene_heading: EXT. TGV -- DAY
text: A HELICOPTER SHOT -- a bullet train speeds through snow-
text: capped Alps. We move in on a window -- and staring out is...
scene_heading: INT. TGV TRAIN -- DAY
text: ...THE MAN. People all around him -- families -- businessmen --
text: normal people going about their lives. THE MAN turns back to
text: the window, but he's not watching the scenery -- he's looking
text: at his reflection. So lost. His face suddenly plunged into
text: darkness as the train bombs into a tunnel...
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT
text: ...and out of the darkness into night and the HELICOPTER
text: SHOT, as the train races toward ZURICH.
scene_heading: INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
text: A VIDEO MONITOR -- FULL FRAME -- meet WOMBOSI. He's an African
dialog: ex-dictator, think Idi Amin crossed with Mobutu. He's in
text: some sort of throne room. And he's angry. Bodyguards and a
text: translator hovering nervously around him. What this is, is
text: NEWS FOOTAGE -- an interview conducted by a German TV station.
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: (he speaks english)
dialog: ...no, no, no -- the time is not
dialog: right, my enemies are too strong.
dialog: I'm telling you to wait for this,
dialog: you understand? I'm telling you this,
dialog: and I'm making a warning to all those
dialog: peoples out there that think that my
dialog: powers have become so weak that they
dialog: can play with me as they wish. You
dialog: will see -- I will tell you when the
dialog: evidence is clear. Then you will
dialog: have a story. My old friends will
dialog: hear about themselves.
dialog: (stopping, freezing
dialog: on that image, and --)
text: MARSHALL, a CIA bigwig has the remote control. And the floor.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in
dialog: Paris the day before yesterday. I'm
dialog: sure most of you have a passing
dialog: knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of
dialog: you on the African desks have worked
dialog: with him over the years. Some of you
dialog: very closely...
text: TWELVE CIA MANDARINS sitting around the table like kids in
text: detention. We will tour the faces as MARSHALL continues, but
text: the guy we're interested in is named WARD ABBOTT. Picture a
dialog: sawier, slicker John Poindexter.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: ...He was an irritation before he
dialog: took power. He was a problem when he
dialog: was in power. And he's been a disaster
dialog: for us in exile.
dialog: (the tape --)
dialog: Wombosi likes to send us messages
dialog: through the European media. This is
dialog: an interview we pulled down from a
dialog: local German television station in
dialog: Dresden. We've been getting these
dialog: little broadsides every couple of
dialog: months. He knows this -- he knows
dialog: that -- he's writing a book about
dialog: the Agency's history in Africa --
dialog: he's going to name names. It's
dialog: basically a shakedown...
text: ABBOTT'S FACE says this is news to him. HIS HANDS suggest
dialog: otherwise.
speaker_heading: MARSHALL
dialog: This interview -- and I'll make the
dialog: tape available for anyone who wants
dialog: it -- he goes on to claim that he
dialog: has just survived an assassination
dialog: attempt. He says it's us. He says
dialog: he's got proof.
dialog: (beat)
text: The overwhelming negative
dialog: ramifications of this should be
dialog: obvious.
dialog: (hard and dry)
dialog: The Director wants to know if there
dialog: is any possible shred of truth in
dialog: this accusation.
text: Long pause. No hands go up.
scene_heading: INT. ZURICH TRAIN STATION -- NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. ZURICH STREETS -- NIGHT
text: THE MAN walking aimlessly.
scene_heading: EXT. ZURICH PARK -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: ZURICH COP #1 (O.S.)
dialog: (authority German)
dialog: Can't you read the signs?
text: THE MAN turns. TWO ZURICH COPS coming toward him.
speaker_heading: ZURICH COP #2
dialog: On your feet. Let's go. Right now.
text: THE MAN makes his feet. They're on top of him now.
speaker_heading: ZURICH COP #1
text: The park is closed. There's no

speaker_heading: ZURICH COP #2
dialog: Let's see some identification.

speaker_heading: ZURICH COP #1
dialog: Come on. Your papers. Let's go.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: I've lost them. I've...
dialog: (German now)
dialog: My papers. They are lost.
speaker_heading: ZURICH COP #1
dialog: (not sympathetic)
dialog: Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up.
speaker_heading: ZURICH COP #2

text: THE MAN raising his hand slowly -- ZURICH COP #1 reaching up
text: to pat him down --
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: -- look, I'm just trying to sleep
dialog: okay? --
dialog: (German again)
dialog: -- I just need to sleep --
text: ZURICH COP #2 has heard enough -- giving a sharp poke with
text: the nightstick -- into THE MAN's back -- and that's the last
dialog: thing he'll remember because --
text: THE MAN is in motion.
text: A single turn -- spinning -- catching COP #2 completely off
text: guard -- the heel of his hand driving up into the guy's throat
dialog: and --
text: COP #1 -- behind him -- trying to reach for his pistol, but
text: THE MAN -- still turning -- all his weight moving in a single
text: fluid attack -- a sweeping kick and --
text: COP #1 -- he's falling -- catching the bench -- trying to
text: fight back but -- THE MAN -- like a machine -- just
text: unbelievably fast -- three jackhammer punches -- down-down-
text: down and -- COP #1 -- head slammed into the bench -- blood
text: spraying from his nose -- he's out cold and --
text: COP #2 -- writhing on the ground -- gasping for air --
text: struggling with his holster -- THE MAN -- his foot -- down --
text: like a vise -- onto COP #2's arm -- shattering the bone --
text: COP #2 starting to scream, and then silenced because --
text: THE MAN -- he's got the pistol -- so fucking fast -- he's
text: got it right up against COP #2's forehead -- right on the
text: edge of pulling the trigger -- he is, he's gonna shoot him --
speaker_heading: ZURICH COP #2
dialog: (gasping, pleading)
dialog: -- no -- please God no -- please
dialog: don't -- please no -- my Go
text: -- stopping as --
text: THE MAN slams the gun against his temple and --
text: This fight is over.
text: THE MAN standing there. In the silence. Two unconscious cops
text: at his feet. Blood on his pants. What just happened? How did
text: he do this? And there's THE GUN in his hand. And God, it
text: just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down --
text: holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done
dialog: a million times before...
text: This is something he definitely knows how to do.
text: And then he stops cold. Throwing down the gun. Running off
text: into the darkness --
scene_heading: INT. TREADSTONE -- DAY
text: A deep, inner office. An ops office. Operations. Unlabeled
text: and anonymous. A backwater project center hidden deep within
text: the Langley facility. Utilitarian. Several rooms linked like
dialog: a suite.
text: Small staff. SEVERAL TECHNICIANS. One or two for
text: communications. A couple for research. People are at their
text: posts. And it's all quiet. But they are busy. Quietly urgent.
dialog: This is a place under siege.
text: ZORN is the number two here. Brilliant bloodless lapdog.
text: He's coming through the suite. Coming through quickly. Heading
text: toward the boss's little office at the back --
text: TED CONKLIN. Ivy League Ollie North. Buttoned down. Square
text: jaw. Everything tucked away. But there's tension in the air.
text: Work on the desk. Cot in the corner.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ZORN
text: Abbott wants to talk.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: Tell him we're busy.
speaker_heading: ZORN
dialog: I tried.
scene_heading: INT. CIA COMMISSARY -- NIGHT
text: ABBOTT with coffee. CONKLIN not lingering.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It
dialog: looks like rain and I don't have a
dialog: thing to wear.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: I don't know what we're talking about.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: We're talking about Marseille. We're
dialog: talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And
dialog: I'm asking you if this abortion in
dialog: Marseille has anything to do with
dialog: Treadstone.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Was this Treadstone?
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: You're asking me a direct question?
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: I thought you were never going to do
dialog: that.
text: Silence. Pressure drop.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: They're putting together an agency
dialog: oversight committee. They're going
dialog: to look through everyone's budgets.
dialog: Treadstone is a rather sizable line
dialog: item in my ledger.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What am I going to do about that?
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: You'd want to make that go away.
dialog: You'd want to remind them that
dialog: Treadstone is a training organization.
dialog: That it's all theoretical. You'd
dialog: want to sign off on that.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: And what if I couldn't do that?
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: Then I'd have to explain Treadstone.
dialog: And you'd have to explain how you
dialog: let me get this far.
dialog: (silence)
text: Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B,
dialog: does it?
dialog: (Abbott staring)
dialog: We'll clean up the field. You clean
dialog: up your budgets.

text: A BIO-METRIC SCANNER. A piece of ultra-tech amidst the

text: Something ominously decisive about this. What if it's him?
dialog: What if it's not?
speaker_heading: BANK GUARD #1
dialog: They've been waiting your hand, sir...
text: THE MAN focuses. Here we go -- BANK GUARD #2 guiding his

scene_heading: INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT VIEWING ROOM -- DAY
text: Sterile and kind of odd. But total privacy. THE MAN sitting
text: there, as A DEPOSIT GUARD places a large SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX
text: before him. THE GUARD leaves the room. Closing the door behind
dialog: him.
text: THE MAN is alone. And there it is, right in front of him.
text: This is it. Here are the answers. He lifts the lid.
text: THE BOX. There's a shallow tray on top. In this tray: a beat-
text: up passport in the name of Jason Bourne. A French driver's
dialog: license with a Parisian address. Credit cards for Jason
dialog: Bourne.
text: THE MAN. Holding these objects close -- as if by holding
dialog: them he might absorb their essence. Forcing himself to
text: believe. This is him. His picture. There it is. He's Jason
dialog: Bourne.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: My name is Jason Bourne.
dialog: (sounds good)
dialog: Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason
dialog: Bourne, nice to meet you.
text: BACK TO -- THE BOX -- the shallow tray on top. There's
text: Kleenex. Several sets of contact lenses. A knife. A comb.
text: Three sticks of gum. A ring. A pair of sunglasses. A Rolex.
text: BOURNE setting these things aside. Lifting the top tray.
text: Staring into THE DEEP BOTTOM TRAY and --
dialog: First of all...
text: MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds.
text: Lots of them. Close to a million dollars. There's A GUN. A
dialog: very good gun. Several clips of ammo. And...
text: FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Crisp. Brand new. All with
text: his photo inside. Five different names. Three different
text: Countries. Each one of these pristine passports clipped to a
dialog: piece of card stock that says:
text: NAME:
text: NATIONALITY:
text: PLACE OF ISSUE:
scene_heading: SIGNATURE SAMPLE:
dialog: And a bar code.
dialog: Two Dutch passports. A French. A South African. A Belgian.
dialog: And...
text: There's one piece of card stock still with the paper clip in
text: place. And no passport. This card reads:
dialog: NAME: John Michael Kane
scene_heading: NATIONALITY: U.S.A.
text: PLACE OF ISSUE: Paris, France
text: There's a signature sample.
text: And a bar code. But no passport. This one is missing.
text: BOURNE sitting there. Trying to push his confusion away.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Bourne. My name is Jason Bourne. I
dialog: live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris.
dialog: But there's something hollow about this. He came looking for
dialog: one identity and now he's faced with six. The money... The
dialog: gun...
dialog: Suddenly, it's all fucked up.
text: BOURNE into gear. Looking around the room -- there -- there's
text: a pile of red canvas burn bags in the corner. BOURNE grabbing
dialog: one -- stuffing everything into it -- everything except...
dialog: The gun. He doesn't want the gun. No guns.
scene_heading: INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT OUTER AREA -- DAY
text: BOURNE is done. Handing the box back to THE DEPOSIT GUARD --

speaker_heading: DEPOSIT GUARD
dialog: I'm not sure. Must be three weeks.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF ZURICH -- DAY -- VARIOUS SHOTS
text: BOURNE exits the bank. The red bag full to its limit. He's
text: walking briskly now. Looking for a taxi. Nothing in sight.
text: BOURNE crossing the street. Shit, there's A COP on the corner --
text: turn -- change pace -- make it look natural --
text: BOURNE around a corner. And it's looking good for a moment --
text: but only a moment -- TWO MORE COPS walking a beat -- walking
text: this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street --
text: BOURNE heading down a boulevard. Trying to look small. Pulse
text: starting to race. Fighting the paranoia. Where the hell is a
text: cab? Turning back fast as A SIREN starts bleeding in from
text: behind him --
text: It's just an ambulance.
text: BOURNE turning back. Forcing himself to focus. And fuck --
text: there's A METER MAID, and she's stopped writing up a ticket --
text: she's staring at him and --
text: BOURNE trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay
text: small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but --
text: THE METER MAID -- she's watching him go and she's pulling
dialog: her radio and --
text: BOURNE hitting this next corner -- banging a right -- forcing

dialog: he's got his radio out and --
text: FINALLY TO --
text: BOURNE bailing on the street -- disappearing into --
scene_heading: EXT. U.S. EMBASSY COMPOUND -- DAY

scene_heading: INT. U.S. CONSULATE ZURICH -- VISA ROOM -- DAY
text: The passport and visa office. Big room. No windows. Unpleasant

dialog: earlier than two weeks ago.
dialog: (it's not flying)
dialog: I'm serious.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What? Like amnesia?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Look, go ahead... put the radio on...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Amnesia?
dialog: (total incredulity)
dialog: You're saying you don't remember
dialog: anything that happened before two

speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: That's what I'm saying.
speaker_heading: MARIE

scene_heading: EXT. ZURICH BANK -- DAY/DUSK
text: APFEL emerges from the bank. Leaving work. Turns the corner
text: into a quiet side street and --
text: Up ahead, here comes another guy in a suit. It's MANHEIM
text: walking toward us, deep into a cell phone conversation. Barely
text: noticing Apfel as they get closer and --
text: As they pass -- MANHEIM -- it's completely out of the blue --
text: he's jabbing the cellphone down into Apfel's shoulder and --
text: APFEL -- no clue -- already clutching at the coronary
text: exploding in his chest -- dead before his body hits the street
dialog: and --
text: MANHEIM -- still walking -- he's never broken stride -- and
text: as he goes he's fiddling with the cellphone and --

text: MANHEIM striding away. Disappearing into Zurich...
scene_heading: INT. PARIS MORGUE -- NIGHT
text: Not the best morgue in town. Cold tile. A wall of freezers.
text: Death lighting. Now add some color. Meet NYKWANA WOMBOSI in
text: the flesh.
dialog: Meet HIS ENTOURAGE -- eight or ten of his thirty children --
dialog: two of his wives -- three of his bodyguards -- the whole
text: crew spread out in this horrible basement room. THE WIVES
text: are chatting. THE KIDS are playing, fighting and eating candy.
text: THE BODYGUARDS -- three of them here -- are white. These
dialog: guys are French/Corsican mercs. Not quite the A-Team. The
text: guy in charge of this ugly little unit is named DEAUVAGE.
dialog: Into it. Too into it.
text: TWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS hanging back. THE MORGUE BOSS -- who's
text: clearly suffering this for a bribe -- moves to one of the
dialog: freezer lockers...
speaker_heading: MORGUE BOSS
dialog: (French)
dialog: Okay, Monsieur Kane... number 121...
text: And he pulls open FREEZER #121. And thank God we can't see
text: it, because whatever's inside there is clearly horrible. THE
text: MORGUE BOSS barely takes a glance, standing back as quickly
dialog: as possible.
text: DEAUVAGE -- lead bodyguard -- moves to clear a zone for his
dialog: boss --
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: Get the fuck out of my way --
dialog: (pushing Deauvage
dialog: aside --)
text: WOMBOSI moves to the freezer box. Stares down. As if it were
text: nothing. He's seen -- he's made -- much, much worse. And now
text: he reaches down into the box -- hands on -- literally feeling
text: around this dead, awful corpse with his bare hands -- feeling
dialog: around for something -- feeling and feeling and not finding --
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: (turning to Deauvage --)
dialog: It's not him.
text: DEAUVAGE looking pale as WOMBOSI slams shut the freezer.
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: (quiet hard fury)
dialog: So who's crazy now?
scene_heading: EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT
text: A MINI-MOTORCADE driving towards Neuilly. Two security cars.
text: A van full of kids and mothers. And one big Mercedes stretch.
scene_heading: INT. THE MERCEDES STRETCH LIMO -- NIGHT
text: WOMBOSI alone in the back. Looking haunted.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCKSTOP CAFE -- NIGHT
text: It's a weird spot. Open all night. But Euro-style. Quiet
text: tonight. A few Alpen-truckers chowing down. A local or two
dialog: at the bar and --
text: BOURNE AND MARIE at a back table. Drinking coffee. He's got
text: the red bag open. All the passports -- the personal junk --
text: the money -- all the shit from the Zurich bank box -- he's
dialog: been showing it to her --
text: And he's got her attention now.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: And you have no idea -- not a clue --
dialog: what came before that?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: When you think of it, before the
dialog: ship -- before you wake up on the
dialog: ship, what do you see?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Nothing. It's just not there.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Well, this is great.
dialog: (she sits back)
dialog: I'm sick of myself and you have no
dialog: idea who you are.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I kept trying things, I thought if I
dialog: could find all the things I could
dialog: do, I could --
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: -- you could put it together --
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: -- which was okay for a while, I was
dialog: okay with it...
dialog: (hesitating now)
dialog: But then -- there's all these other
dialog: things -- all these other things I
dialog: know how to do -- and this -- this
dialog: stuff from the bank and...
dialog: (suddenly flat out --)
dialog: I think something bad happened.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Sounds like you were in an accident
dialog: or something.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I was shot twice in the back.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Okay, so you're a victim.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: There was a gun. Who has a safe
dialog: deposit box with a gun and all this
dialog: money and all these passports?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Lots of people have guns. You're
dialog: American. Americans love guns.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I fought my way out of an embassy.
dialog: I climbed down a fifty-foot wall --
dialog: I went out the window and I was doing
dialog: it -- I just did it. I knew how to
dialog: do it.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: People do amazing things when they're
dialog: scared.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Why do I? -- I come in here --
dialog: instinctively -- first thing I do --
dialog: I'm looking for the exit -- I'm
dialog: catching the sightlines -- I know I
dialog: can't sit with my back to the door --
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You're paranoid. You were shot. It's
dialog: natural.
text: She's not listening. He leans in. Flat out now.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I can tell you the license plate
text: numbers of all three cars out front.
dialog: I can tell you that the waitress is
text: left-handed and the guy at the counter
dialog: weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds
dialog: and knows how to handle himself. I
dialog: know that the best, first place to
dialog: look for a gun is the cab of that
dialog: grey truck outside. I know that at
dialog: this altitude I can run flat out for
dialog: half a mile before I lose my edge. I
dialog: knew that you were my first, best
dialog: option out of Zurich? How do I know
dialog: all that? How can I know all that
dialog: and not know who I am? How is that
dialog: possible?
dialog: Long dead pause.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: God, you're not kidding, are you?

scene_heading: EXT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL -- NIGHT
text: A drone barn. Practically on the runway.
scene_heading: INT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: One of those rooms. Just a plain functional box. MANHEIM
text: laying on the bed. Fully dressed. Suit and tie. Just laying
text: there, staring at the ceiling. Who knows how long he's been
dialog: like this.
dialog: Just waiting.
text: ON THE NIGHTSTAND -- A gun. A knife. His e-phone pager. His

scene_heading: INT. WOMBOSI'S PARIS COMPOUND -- NIGHT
text: Quick orientation: Picture a heavily-walled palace just off
dialog: the Bois Du Boulogne. But once inside you could be back in
text: Brazzaville. It's just a buffet of oddness. Home to fifty
text: children and nine wives. The decor blends money and nouveau
text: riche materialism with a hard, back-home tribal esthetic.
text: It's a visual treat. Not condescending or stupid, but flat-
text: out strange and menacing.
text: It's late. And the palace is dark and sleepy now, but carry
text: all that through this next series of quick shots --
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI HOUSE SECURITY STATION

speaker_heading: FINALLY TO
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI'S THRONE ROOM
text: And there he is -- the emperor himself -- WOMBOSI on his
text: throne. Except the room is dark and empty. And he's sitting
dialog: there by himself. A king without a country.
text: Sitting there. With a gun in his lap. Drinking hard from a
dialog: bottle of Jack Daniels.
dialog: Stewing.
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH ROADSIDE -- DAWN
text: Beautiful morning. The red car parked along the road. BOURNE
text: alone in the passenger seat. Deep asleep. Nestled there.
text: And then, he wakes suddenly. Starts. Freaked for a moment.
text: Instantly feeling for the red bag. There it is in his lap.
text: He looks around and --
text: MARIE sitting away from the car. She's got a loaf of bread.
text: A soda. Smoking a butt. Same clothes, but her make-up's been
dialog: washed away. Clean. Simple. Gorgeous.
text: BOURNE steps out. Morning legs.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I needed a break.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: We're about an hour away.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I can't believe I slept.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You were tired. Here...
dialog: (bread and soda --)
dialog: For twenty-thousand I like to throw
dialog: in breakfast.
dialog: (he takes it)
dialog: So what do you dream about?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm
dialog: asleep and I can't wake up.
dialog: (he takes a hit from
dialog: her smoke and coughs --)
dialog: I don't think I smoke.
text: Another silence. She's watching him.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You ever think maybe you have a
dialog: family?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I thought about it. I don't know.
text: She looks away. Was she hoping for another answer?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I guess it's like Christmas every

scene_heading: INT. TREADSTONE CONKLIN'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: MARIE'S FACE -- A PASSPORT PHOTO -- she's eighteen -- she's
text: smiling -- really alive and fresh and --
text: CONKLIN behind his desk. ABBOTT staring grimly at the picture --
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: Who is she?
speaker_heading: ZORN
dialog: Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty-
dialog: six. Born outside Munich. Father was
dialog: a welder. He died in '91. We don't
dialog: have the mother. There might be a
dialog: step-sister, we're trying to track
dialog: that down.
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: It's tough. She's a wanderer. She
text: pops up on the grid here and there
dialog: but... I mean, the last time she
dialog: paid an electric bill in Europe was
dialog: '94. No taxes. No steady employer.
dialog: She's got three arrests. Two
dialog: shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one
dialog: in Germany. And she actually did
dialog: three months in an Italian detention
dialog: center for credit card fraud.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: No political affiliations?
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's
dialog: a great one.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: I'm assuming we're exploring that
dialog: possibility.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: We're exploring every possibility.
dialog: (tighter by the moment)
dialog: We are in pursuit. How much more do
dialog: you want me to tell you?
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: Pursuit would indicate that you know
text: exactly where he is.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly
text: where he is.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: Yes, well, I think we need some fresh
dialog: eyes on this problem. I'm bringing
text: in some people from upstairs.
text: CONKLIN hesitates. Inside he's screaming.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: We've been down here for two weeks
text: banging our heads against the wall.
dialog: We've been sleeping down here. We
dialog: just got our first lead fourteen
dialog: hours ago, and now? -- now that we
dialog: finally have something to work with --
dialog: you want to bring planning personnel
dialog: down here?
dialog: (real steam)
dialog: I'd rethink that.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: I want a second opinion.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: This is an operations desk.

speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Slow down. No, don't stop. Just...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (looking over)
dialog: That's it? Is that it?
text: AN APARTMENT BUILDING. Big building. Elegant but cold.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Four-fifty. That's the address...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Looks familiar?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: No.
dialog: (staring back as they

dialog: No. Go around. Keep going...
text: MARIE pulling up -- turning a corner -- watching him as she
text: does. But he's pre-occupied -- eyes scanning -- taking it
dialog: all in --
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.
text: MARIE angles into an alleyway. Cuts the engine.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: So this is it, right?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I guess.
text: Dead pause. She's waiting. He's still scanning the street.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I should go.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I don't remember any of this.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Jason...
text: He turns back. She's staring at him.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Sorry. The money, right?
text: Before she can say anything, he's digging in the backpack.
text: He pulls out another stack of hundreds. Hands it over. She
text: takes it. It's not what she wanted, but she's used to being
dialog: disappointed. Fighting it.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Okay, so...
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Thanks for the ride.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Anytime.
text: Silence. That moment. He focuses. Getting it.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Look, I don't know what's up there.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You got me pretty fucking curious.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Look, you could come up. Or you could
dialog: wait if you want. I could go check
dialog: it out. You could wait.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Nah...
dialog: (hide the pain)
dialog: With you, I mean, you'd probably
dialog: just forget about me, right?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: How could I forget about you?
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: You're the only person I know.
text: MARIE smiles. We've never seen it before. Worth waiting for.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER -- NIGHT
text: BOURNE and MARIE standing at the directory. Five apartments.
text: One per floor. Five names. A buzzer. An intercom. There it
dialog: is.
dialog: J. Bourne.
text: BOURNE presses the buzzer. After a moment, he presses again.
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I guess you're not home.
text: BOURNE checking the door. How to pop it open? Just about to
dialog: get into it, when --
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE (O.S.)
dialog: (from the shadows
dialog: inside --)
dialog: Monsieur Bourne...I'm coming...
text: THE CONCIERGE is sixty. Plump and proper.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE

dialog: Mr. Bourne, there you are -- I was
dialog: wondering -- I haven't seen you --
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Here I am.
text: THE CONCIERGE looking at BOURNE like maybe she's never seen
text: him look like this before. And she's looking at MARIE like
dialog: here's the reason her tenant looks like such shit.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: (he tries a smile)
dialog: I seem to have lost my key.
text: THE CONCIERGE nods. Instant chilly disapproval.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: I've been ringing your bell. It's
dialog: good you were away. We had some
dialog: trouble with the hot water. It's
dialog: been repaired.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Great. We could use a shower.
dialog: (they look like shit --)
dialog: It was a long drive.
text: THE CONCIERGE steps aside and --
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT FIFTH FLOOR LANDING -- DAY
text: BOURNE and MARIE at the apartment threshold. He has a key
dialog: now.
text: Turning it. And the door opens...
dialog: Nothing...
dialog: No bombs. No wife and kids. No one.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY
text: A huge, rambling flat. Large entry hallway. Large rooms beyond
text: that. It's obviously expensive. But cold. Completely
dialog: impersonal. No photographs. No mementoes. No human history.
dialog: WE'RE MOVING NOW
speaker_heading: THE LIVING ROOM
text: BOURNE and MARIE exploring.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It's big.
text: BOURNE silent. Struggling to get a feel for the place.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: This is like a real apartment.
dialog: (she likes it)
dialog: This is really yours?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I guess so.
text: MARIE taking it in fast. BOURNE seems paralyzed. Trying to
text: soak it all in. Willing himself home. Touching things as he
text: passes. As if a texture, a smell -- something will become
text: familiar. He's deep into this as we go to --
speaker_heading: THE BEDROOM
text: MARIE in the doorway. Checking it out. It's so clean and
text: simple. But it's not the decor she's most interested in...
text: MARIE opening an armoire...
text: Nothing but men's clothes. No competition. She's feeling
dialog: better by the moment as we go to --
speaker_heading: THE KITCHEN
text: Like a stage set. Lots of props and no sign of food. BOURNE
text: picking up a frying pan.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: This is my frying pan.
dialog: (and then --)
dialog: This is my spoon.
dialog: (trying harder)
dialog: I'm Jason Bourne and this is my
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: THE MASTER BATHROOM
text: MARIE still on the prowl. Mirror city. Big tub. One
dialog: toothbrush.
speaker_heading: AN OFFICE STUDY
text: There's a desk. Chair. Phone. Basic. BOURNE with a folder in
text: his hand. Staring at the bookshelves. Binders, reference
text: materials and hardbound volumes -- all of it about maritime
dialog: law. Ship schedules. Registry catalogs. All about boats.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: This is your office?
dialog: (from the doorway)
dialog: God, you live like a monk...
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: All this stuff -- it's all about
dialog: boats.
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: I think I'm in the shipping business.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: See. It's starting to come back,
dialog: yeah?
dialog: (he sort of nods)
dialog: You mind if I take a bath?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Go ahead.
text: MARIE backs out. BOURNE alone again. Standing there for a
dialog: moment. Dealing with it.
text: And then he sits down in a chair.
text: BOURNE sitting there. Staring. The room, the desk -- it's
text: all so devoid of personality. And then, something catches
text: his eye and --
text: INSERT -- THE DESK TOP -- a faint silhouette through the
text: dust and grime. Outlines of where a computer used to sit.
text: BOURNE reaching suddenly under the desk. Bingo. Pulling out
text: a retractable computer keyboard tray. But it's empty. No
text: keyboard. Now he's really confused and --
text: INSERT -- A PHONE/ANSWERING MACHINE -- BOURNE pressing the
dialog: playback button and --
speaker_heading: PHONE MACHINE
dialog: "You have no messages."
text: BOURNE leaving that for a moment -- about to anyway -- and
text: then he turns back -- new idea -- pressing for the speaker
text: phone -- and then hitting redial and --
text: THE PHONE stars dialing...
dialog: RINGING and...
speaker_heading: OPERATOR/PHONE
dialog: Bonjour, Hotel Marboeuf...
text: BOURNE quick grabbing the receiver. Taking it off speakerphone
dialog: and --
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: ...yes -- oui -- uh...
speaker_heading: OPERATOR/PHONE
dialog: Yes, sir. Hotel Marboeuf, Paris.
dialog: How can I direct your call?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Paris?
speaker_heading: OPERATOR/PHONE
dialog: Yes, sir...
dialog: (switching to English,
dialog: thinking that's his
dialog: problem --)
dialog: How can I help you?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason
dialog: Bourne.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR/PHONE
dialog: One moment, please...
dialog: (a long pause, and
dialog: then --)
dialog: I'm afraid, I have no one by that
dialog: name registered, sir.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: D'accord... Merci.
dialog: (about to hang up--)
dialog: Un moment -- un moment --
speaker_heading: OPERATOR/PHONE
dialog: -- sir? --
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: -- hang on -- I need you to check
dialog: another name for me -- hang on -- un
dialog: moment, s'il vous plait --
text: BOURNE grabbing the backpack -- tearing through it -- where
dialog: is it? -- where is it? -- shit and money falling out and --
text: There it is -- from the safe-deposit box -- that piece of

speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: (reading it)
dialog: Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael
dialog: Kane?
speaker_heading: OPERATOR/PHONE
dialog: One moment, sir.
text: BOURNE waiting. And then there's muzak -- holding music and --
speaker_heading: THE MASTER BATHROOM
text: Water running in the tub. MARIE pulling off her boots.
text: Checking the temperature.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICE STUDY
text: Bourne still on hold. And then --
speaker_heading: MANAGER/PHONE
dialog: (a new voice suddenly)
dialog: Bonjour? Monsieur? Allo...
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Yes, I'm here...
speaker_heading: MANAGER/PHONE
dialog: You call about Monsieur Kane? John
dialog: Michael Kane?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Yes. Is he there?
speaker_heading: MANAGER/PHONE
dialog: You are a friend of his?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MANAGER/PHONE
dialog: I have some very bad news for you,
dialog: sir. I'm terrible sorry to have to
dialog: tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has
dialog: passed away almost two weeks ago...
text: Silence. BOURNE is rocked. But the Manager, it's natural, he
text: interprets the silence as grief...
speaker_heading: MANAGER/PHONE
dialog: There was an accident. On the
dialog: motorway. Apparently, he was killed
dialog: instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry
dialog: to be the one to tell you this...
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: ...I understand...
speaker_heading: MANAGER/PHONE
dialog: ...we actually, we were unaware for
dialog: several days that this had happened.
dialog: When they came for his things, it
dialog: was made known for us, you see?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Who? Who came?
speaker_heading: MANAGER/PHONE
dialog: His brother. You know his brother?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Right. Yes. Of course.
speaker_heading: MANAGER/PHONE
dialog: It's very bad this. Terrible sad.
dialog: Such a young man.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Do you -- his brother -- do you have
dialog: a phone number?
speaker_heading: MANAGER/PHONE
dialog: I think not...
dialog: (quick French to
dialog: someone in the office
dialog: there --)
dialog: No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden.
dialog: He was here very briefly.
text: BOURNE just hands up the phone. Just like that. Not even
text: goodbye. Standing there frozen. Stunned. John Michael Kane
dialog: is dead. And he had the passport.
text: Suddenly, everything's changed. They shouldn't be here. This
dialog: is bad. Danger.
speaker_heading: THE MASTER BATHROOM
text: MARIE playing with her hair in the mirror. Checking the water --
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (calling out to him --)
dialog: She wasn't kidding about the water.
dialog: It's freezing.
speaker_heading: THE OFFICE
text: BOURNE frozen there. On alert. He forces a smile. Decoy mood.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Hang on. I'll check the kitchen...
dialog: (moving out of the
dialog: office --)
dialog: Maybe it takes a while to get all
dialog: the way upstairs.
speaker_heading: THE KITCHEN
text: BOURNE moving to the sink. He's smiling. Upbeat. But it's an
text: act. His eyes are everywhere. Turning on the water. But

text: Standing still. Taking it all in.
text: Real quick layout -- there's big windows along one wall that

text: HOTEL MARBOEUF PARIS. This is the place that answered the
text: phone when Bourne hit redial in his apartment. This is the
dialog: place that John Michael Kane was staying when he "died."
dialog: And so begins, the investigation...
dialog: Now, since the presence of danger -- ie Wombosi's guys and/or
text: Treadstone -- is still up in the air, and since this scene
dialog: could either play very quickly or very long, and since we're
text: not exactly sure where we stand with page count -- this scene
dialog: is not finished.
dialog: The rules of the scene, however, seem to be thus: Bourne
dialog: would have to be very nervous about being recognized. If he
dialog: was Kane and Kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever
dialog: "social engineering" needs doing.
text: Long version? Bourne sets the table and Marie gets the goods.
text: Somehow there's a threat from Treadstone or Wombosi.
text: Fast version? It's all results -- we see them execute a plan
text: rather than work it up. MARIE is already in the hotel. In a
text: hotel uniform? Posing as a guest? In any case, she looks
text: very much different than we've ever seen her before.
text: She gets close to the office. Hides. Waits. BOURNE calls the
text: desk from a pay phone. Asks for something. We see that some
text: sort of improvised booby-trap has been set inside the hotel
text: to start a fire. In the confusion -- MARIE -- very bravely --

dialog: (sitting there tensely)
dialog: We can't risk it.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: Our last sighting was forty-eight
dialog: hours ago. Even if they stayed in
text: the car, the grid is huge.
dialog: (please)
dialog: This is it. He's trained --
dialog: conditioned -- they're built to
dialog: disappear. You give him another day
dialog: to run and we may never find him.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: This doesn't go upstairs.
text: CONKLIN left hanging. ABBOTT clear on this one.
scene_heading: EXT. EST. SHOT -- LA DEFENSE -- DAY
dialog: Monolithic tech. Reflection city.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR -- LA DEFENSE -- DAY
text: BOURNE dressed for success. Suit. Cleaned up good. Catching
text: his reflection in the elevator's mirrored ceiling. Nerves on
dialog: edge.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE LOBBY -- DAY
text: ALLIANCE SECURITY MARITIME DIVISION. Glossy posters of yachts,
text: tankers and luxury sailboats. BOURNE standing there. Sucking
text: it up. God knows what he's walking into here and --
scene_heading: INT. ALLIANCE SECURITY -- DAY
text: A SECRETARY leading BOURNE through a suite of offices and
text: into --
scene_heading: INT. PETER RAWLINS' OFFICE -- DAY
text: Meet RAWLINS. He's a young, jolly Brit -- pink and overfed --
dialog: and quite shocked to see...
speaker_heading: RAWLINS
dialog: Mr. Kane...
dialog: (hastily tidying up)
dialog: Come right in... please... have a
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Thanks.
text: BOURNE just trying to feel his way through this...
speaker_heading: RAWLINS
dialog: Well...
dialog: (really thrown)
dialog: I must admit, when my assistant told
dialog: me you were here I was, really -- I
dialog: was quite -- I was surprised.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: RAWLINS
dialog: We thought you were gone for good.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: RAWLINS
dialog: Well, I mean it's a tough business,
dialog: isn't it? Cutthroat.
text: A long awkward beat. Neither of them sure where to go.
speaker_heading: RAWLINS
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Look, our bid -- it was competitive --
dialog: but definitely at the high end of
dialog: competitive -- when we didn't hear
dialog: back from you, we did some re-analysis
dialog: of the numbers, and honestly, we'd
dialog: really like a chance to do a bit
dialog: better.
dialog: (pitching now)
dialog: I'm assuming you're still in the
dialog: market. It's the same vessel?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RAWLINS
dialog: We just picked up a job quite like
dialog: the one we were bidding for you.
dialog: Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy-
dialog: five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think
dialog: we learned a few things that might
dialog: allow us to make our proposal for
dialog: your job, as I said, a bit more
dialog: competitive.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Okay.
text: Another beat. Rawlins holding back until now...
speaker_heading: RAWLINS
dialog: Was it the break-in?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: RAWLINS
dialog: We also thought we hadn't heard from
dialog: you -- we've had a bit of a publicity
dialog: nightmare, people have been talking.
dialog: (the meat)
dialog: Our offices were broken into --
dialog: vandalism mostly -- shortly after we
dialog: last spoke.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I hadn't heard.
text: RAWLINS smiles. Reset. Sales mode.
speaker_heading: RAWLINS
dialog: Let me get you a new copy of the

speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: That'd be great.
scene_heading: INT. A CAFÉ NEAR LA DEFENSE -- DAY
text: BOURNE entering. And there's MARIE in the back working a

text: BOURNE sits. Pulls out the Alliance Security Brochures and
text: literature. Flipping through it. Boats. Water. He's getting
text: closer. Pictures of yachts and various security blurbs and a
text: list of references for huge yachts -- jobs they've done in
dialog: the past...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I found it.
dialog: (standing there)
dialog: It took six calls.
dialog: (she's creeped out)

speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Kane. John Michael Kane.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT #2
dialog: It's number 121.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I want to see the body.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT #1
dialog: Our boss could come back. We're not
dialog: supposed to.
text: BOURNE pulling out another hundred and --
speaker_heading: MORGUE FREEZER ROOM
text: It's showtime. MARIE back by the door. BOURNE right on it.
text: ATTENDANT #1 pulling open the freezer and...
text: BOURNE sags. ATTENDANT #1 looking baffled.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What?
text: INSERT -- FREEZER #121 -- it's empty.
speaker_heading: MORGUE BOSS (O.S.)
dialog: (from behind them --)
dialog: What the hell's going on here?

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT #1

speaker_heading: MORGUE BOSS
dialog: They came last night. His brother.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT #2
dialog: It's not in the book.
speaker_heading: MORGUE BOSS
dialog: Who are these people?
dialog: (now English to Bourne)
dialog: Who are you? What's going on here?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Where did this body go?
speaker_heading: MORGUE BOSS
dialog: I said, someone came last night --
dialog: (big attitude now)
dialog: Look, this isn't a carnival -- people
dialog: call and they make an appointment
dialog: and they follow the rules -- everyone
text: signs in and out -- this is a serious
dialog: place -- serious work -- it's not
dialog: just to come in whenever you like --
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: (like a shot)
dialog: Shit, we didn't sign in.
speaker_heading: MORGUE BOSS
dialog: So get the hell out of here.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Fine. But I'd like to sign in. In
dialog: fact, I insist on it. Where's the

dialog: (off and running now --)
text: Everybody following -- all of them confused -- and into --
speaker_heading: FRONT DESK AREA
text: BOURNE there first -- all forward motion here -- balls out --
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Is this it? --

dialog: -- this is it, right? --
speaker_heading: MORGUE BOSS
dialog: -- slow down -- you can't just take
dialog: the book like that --
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: -- don't sweat it, I have a pen --
dialog: no problem -- just let me find the
text: page --
dialog: (then quick to Marie)
dialog: -- honey, why don't you wait for me
dialog: outside, okay? --
text: MARIE trying to take the hint, but she's curious what he's
dialog: doing --
speaker_heading: MORGUE BOSS
dialog: -- we have rules here, this is a

dialog: who decides who gets in here, okay? --
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: -- what do I? -- I put the name of

speaker_heading: MORGUE BOSS
dialog: -- this is serious business down
dialog: here and we cannot have people coming

speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: -- here we go -- I found it --
text: But he's not writing -- he's ripping -- tearing the page out

speaker_heading: MORGUE BOSS
dialog: -- what are you? -- what are you
dialog: doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped
dialog: the book! -- you stupid fucki--
dialog: (no chance to finish
dialog: this, because --)
text: BOURNE just slammed him against the wall. Hard. Like a tractor
dialog: hit him. And fast.
text: And that shuts up the room.
text: THE TWO ATTENDANTS rushing to help their boss --
text: BOURNE grabbing MARIE and pulling her out the door --
scene_heading: EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT
text: Moments after the morgue. BOURNE striding away. MARIE

text: in -- he's close -- he's hardening --
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What are you doing? --
dialog: (he's scaring her)
dialog: -- Jason -- stop -- talk to me...
text: BOURNE ignoring her -- ripping through the Alliance Security
text: brochures -- scanning them as he walks --
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: -- I don't know what you're doing
dialog: and you're scaring me -- what are
dialog: you looking for? -- what just happened

speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Nykwana Wombosi.
dialog: (he stops, holding up
dialog: the brochure --)
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty
dialog: million dollar yacht. He's the proud
text: owner of an Alliance Security package.
dialog: (handing her the
dialog: brochure --)
dialog: He also paid a visit to the morgue
dialog: to see John Michael Kane.
dialog: (the ripped-out page --)
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What does that mean?
dialog: (but he's walking
dialog: again --)
dialog: Jason, what does that mean?
dialog: (she's trying to catch

dialog: Jason, please... who is he?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I don't know.

speaker_heading: MARIE

speaker_heading: ZORN

scene_heading: EXT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: ABBOTT

speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: (to Abbott)
dialog: -- if we can get a clean shot --
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: -- inside the house? --
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: -- that's what they're trained for --

speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: What do you want to do?
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: We don't know what we're into!
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: We're in the shitter, man! Pick your
dialog: poison. Maybe he's in there to finish
dialog: the job. Maybe he's working for
dialog: Wombosi. Maybe they want to go on TV
dialog: together. Every possibility sucks --

scene_heading: INT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: DEAUVAGE and BODYGUARD #1 giving BOURNE a serious pat down.

scene_heading: INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: CONKLIN

dialog: You people come down here and wink
dialog: and whisper and we send these guys
dialog: out and get it done. And you're clear.
dialog: And the guys upstairs get what they
dialog: want. And the whole bunch of you are
dialog: so stuffed on deniability it's coming
dialog: out of your ears.
dialog: (gauntlet)
dialog: Well, you know what? You're here
dialog: now. What do you want to do?

speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: Come in.
dialog: (an imperial gesture)
dialog: Please...
text: BOURNE steps up to the plate.
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: Did you bring investment advice for
dialog: me tonight? It was tax shelters,
dialog: wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: MPG Capital.
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: I think investment advice from a
dialog: dead man, it's a bad idea.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How does it feel to be dead?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: It's a lot more stressful than I
dialog: thought.
text: KIDS have started sneaking into the room -- DEAUVAGE is trying
dialog: to scoot them out but --
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: -- no -- no, let them in! -- let
text: them in.
dialog: (to the kids)
dialog: Come in -- on y va -- come in...
dialog: (to Bourne)
dialog: I think everyone wants to see the
text: dead man.
text: BOURNE watching the kids -- they are all staring --
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: What do you do?
dialog: (on his feet now --)
dialog: You get an appointment with me? You
dialog: make sure it's on the boat? You come
dialog: visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit
dialog: investment package. You drink my
dialog: water -- eat my bread -- play with
dialog: my children -- and what? -- two nights
dialog: later you come back and you put this
dialog: death --
dialog: (slamming something
dialog: down onto the throne --)
dialog: -- you put this in my engine room!
text: There is A BOMB on the throne now.
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: So this is a different kind of
dialog: meeting.
dialog: (steam building)
dialog: Maybe now we talk some truth, okay?
dialog: One dead man to another.
text: BOURNE -- caught off guard as -- WOMBOSI suddenly rips away
text: his jacket -- so hard that he tears straight through to the
text: shirt --
text: BOURNE'S BACK -- bare -- two bullet scars -- still raw --
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: You see this?
dialog: (calling to Deauvage --)
dialog: I told you my shot was better!
speaker_heading: DEAUVAGE
dialog: He went in the water -- how did he
dialog: live?
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: No, no no...
dialog: (and he means this --)
dialog: This is a strong killer. This is a
dialog: crazy strong killer. Oh, yeah...
dialog: (circling)
dialog: To make a killer that looks like
dialog: you? This young? This face?
dialog: (he means this)
dialog: It's bloody fucking amazing.
text: BOURNE imploding -- this news -- the kids staring at him --
text: the bomb -- it's all getting loud around him --
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Who do you think sent me?
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: I know who sent you. I don't know
dialog: why.
dialog: (this could get
dialog: physical at any moment
dialog: now --)
dialog: I learned many, many things from the
dialog: CIA. Many things. I learned the way
dialog: they think.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Was the bomb on my boat supposed to
dialog: go off or not?
text: BOURNE distracted by the kids -- these faces -- it's...
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: You didn't set the bomb. Why?
text: BOURNE not sure -- about any of it --
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: Was this a game or a fuck up?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: Get the kids out!
dialog: He doesn't have to say it twice -- they know the drill --
dialog: they're gone.
speaker_heading: WOMBOSI
dialog: And the door.
text: DEAUVAGE closing the doors and as he does --
text: THE PROFESSOR ATTACKS...
dialog: ...................................................
text: THIS SCENE HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN
text: It's a shootout.
dialog: The Professor is infinitely more talented at this than the
dialog: bodyguards.
dialog: Bourne needs to get out of there -- without looking wimpy --
dialog: No children are harmed.
text: As the Professor rallies -- he will shoot Wombosi -- he will
text: find Bourne's jacket left on the floor (in which later he
dialog: will find a clue leading him to Belleville) and last but
dialog: hardly least, he will take a parting shot at the bomb still
text: sitting there on the throne.
text: There will be a huge, trailer-worthy explosion.
dialog: This might not want to be very long. There is an extensive
text: action sequence just around the corner.
text: So Bourne escapes. Physically he's just weary. Emotionally
dialog: he's fucked.
text: All of that happens and we cut to --
dialog: ...................................................
scene_heading: INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: I'm going to Paris.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: No you're not. You're not going
dialog: anywhere. I'm shutting this down.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: You're not doing shit. You're so
dialog: scared you can't even think.
speaker_heading: ABBOTT
dialog: You just blew up a house in Paris!
dialog: This program is over. Call it off.
speaker_heading: CONKLIN
dialog: I can't call it off. He's not

text: CONKLIN splits and --
scene_heading: INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: It's really late. BOURNE enters the room. MARIE in the corner.
dialog: Smoked out. Cried out. Lifed out.
text: Silence. Not a word.
text: His shirt is torn to shit. He scraped-up -- blood here and
text: there. He moves past her into --
speaker_heading: THE BATHROOM
text: His hands shaking as he tries to wash them. He bags it.
speaker_heading: THE ROOM
text: BOURNE comes out. And there's a long silence until --
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It doesn't matter who you were before.
dialog: It's who you want to be. That's all
dialog: that matters.
dialog: (is he listening?)
dialog: We have this money. We have what we
dialog: have. I had nothing before and now,
dialog: I don't know, maybe I have more,
dialog: maybe it's nothing, but...
dialog: (he looks over)
dialog: I say we leave here. We leave this
dialog: place. We go until we can't go
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: You could do that?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Yes. That's who I want to be.
text: BOURNE nods. Turns off the light. Takes her hand. And they
dialog: lay in bed. Just laying there.
scene_heading: INT. PARIS SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT
text: THE PROFESSOR cooping somewhere. Tending to his wounds.

speaker_heading: BOURNE

speaker_heading: MARIE
speaker_heading: xxxxxx

speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Stop where you are.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What?
text: Bourne turns back to the CLERK.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Where's the dog?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: My husband's out looking for him.
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: He run away often?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: That old beast? Miss his breakfast?

speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Get in the basement.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: (to Marie)
dialog: Get everyone down in the basement.
dialog: Now MARIE doesn't need a second warning --
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: What the hell're you talking about?
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: You're in danger. All of you. I have
dialog: no time to explain.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Wait a minute --
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: -- those words -- the way he said it -- she's grabbing her

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Jason...
text: No answer -- too busy -- reaching under the check-in desk,
text: coming up with -- A SHOT GUN, an old one, but nonetheless a
text: gun --
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Who is it? Who's out there?
text: And now BOURNE is moving, pulling open a drawer. A box of

speaker_heading: BOURNE
speaker_heading: xxxxxx
speaker_heading: MARIE
speaker_heading: xxxxxx
speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: I won't let that happen.

scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- COURTYARD -- DAY
text: THE HOTEL BACK DOOR -- kicked open -- BOURNE coming out of

speaker_heading: BOURNE

speaker_heading: MARIE
speaker_heading: xxxxxx

speaker_heading: BOURNE
dialog: Go!
text: MARIE takes off running. BOURNE leans over the wall, FIRES

text: Rounds a bend, is chambering two rounds when he sees -- a
text: WOMAN is in her kitchen -- staring at him -- no time to
text: explain -- he turns back --
text: The PROFESSOR is just vaulting over the wall. BOURNE FIRES
text: TWICE -- BAM! BAM! But the spray is too wide from this
text: distance. Windows are shattered to both sides of him but --
text: the PROFESSOR stumbles but keeps going -- blood on his face
text: now -- RATATAT --
text: BOURNE has to move. Reloading his almost useless gun. Reaching
text: MARIE -- facing a choice and they climb a wall -- FLOWER
text: POTS EXPLODE around them but they make it -- now --
text: RUNNING IN A LABYRINTH -- right -- then left -- through a
text: small staircase. LEAPING a wall -- landing on a STEEP ROOF --
text: sliding, falling, crashing to the ground in --
text: A SMALL COURTYARD -- steep walls on all sides. But there's a

scene_heading: INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- BATHROOM -- DAY
text: They close the window behind them -- catch their breath --
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Did we lose them?

scene_heading: INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- DAY

text: THE SECOND POLICE CAR isn't braking -- T-BONES the first car --

text: people diving out of their way and --
text: AT THE STAIRCASE -- THE WINDOW of the POLICE CAR is kicked

text: and -- HERE COMES A TRAIN -- on BOURNE and MARIE's side --
dialog: travelling the opposite way -- temporary refuge. Not for

text: STRAPHANGERS stare at BOURNE and MARIE as they stop onto the
text: platform -- take off running.
text: THE PROFESSOR has to turn his bike around. He's quick -- but
text: it gives BOURNE and MARIE a two second head start.
text: BOURNE AND MARIE almost at the other end of the platform --
text: gunfire ripping up the windows behind them. Gonna go for the
dialog: steps -- but here come --
text: THE ANGRY COPS -- remember them? -- the ones who took the

text: BOURNE AND MARIE turn back -- the PROFESSOR is firing and
dialog: there is only one option --
scene_heading: INT. METRO CAR -- DAY
text: BOURNE and MARIE into the conductor booth. People diving off
text: the train as BOURNE hits the YELLOW BUTTON and -- the TRAIN
text: STARTS ROLLING -- doors still open -- they disappear into
text: the protection of the tunnel walls -- then BOURNE hits the
text: button to close the doors and -- THE PROFESSOR -- watching
text: the trains accelerate out of the station -- and now he's
text: racing his bike down the platform -- opposite the motion of
text: the train and -- here comes the end of the train and --THE
text: PROFESSOR throws his bike into a skidding 180 and skids off
text: the platform all in one move -- landing hard on the tracks
text: but facing the right direction and now he's accelerating
text: towards the train -- just as an oncoming train is racing
text: into the station and -- HE LEAPS onto the back of the train

text: IN THE LAST METRO CAR

text: BOURNE grabs the knob, swings the door open and CRUSHES the
text: PROFESSOR -- CRUSHES him again and now he is free and --
text: BOURNE turns, pulls up the shotgun and -- the PROFESSOR kicks
text: it out of his hands -- it clatters to the ground and now we
text: have a beat -- THE TRAIN CAR races across the Bir Hakeim
text: bridge -- all of Paris laid out behind them. BOURNE and the
text: PROFESSOR squaring off -- both looking at the gun -- realizing
dialog: there's no chance for either one of them to get it and --
text: A BRUTAL RUTHLESS FIGHT breaks out. BOURNE's motivated --
text: the PROFESSOR's crazy -- makes it a pretty even match. Looks
dialog: like it could go on for a little while when suddenly --
text: BAM!!! The PROFESSOR drops to the ground -- behind him --
text: MARIE wields the shot gun.
speaker_heading: MARIE
