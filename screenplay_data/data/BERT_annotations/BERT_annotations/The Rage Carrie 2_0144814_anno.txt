text: Perhaps even eerie.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: On a sea of red, filling the frame. A crimson ocean without

text: A thick housepainter's BRUSH dips in, revealing its paint.
text: The BRUSH is extracted, paint dripping like congealing blood.
text: FOLLOW THE BRUSH to reveal...
scene_heading: INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A white wall, where the BRUSH is moved horizontally, leaving
text: a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out.
text: A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can,
text: then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall:
text: until it reaches &amp;pleated drape --
text: -- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the
text: same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped.
speaker_heading: A PUPPY,
text: a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit
text: perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird.
text: The dog looks over to...
scene_heading: A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
text: standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark
text: haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the
text: verge of tears.
text: The BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture
text: frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral,
text: forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame.
text: Another ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel
text: to the floor, extending around a modest living room.
text: Painting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn,
text: haggard- She hasn't slept in a while.
dialog: The precision of her work, her concentration, her focus, as

text: BARBARA hears nothing, says nothing, just wipes a paint drip.
dialog: This is a very careful line.

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Right now, mommy, okay?

text: She starts towards her, but the OFFICER holds her back.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Honey, she just has to go somewhere,
dialog: to get some rest, so she'll feel

text: FOLLOW RACHEL as she rushes through the living room and down
text: a hall. Another door slams shut behind her.
speaker_heading: HER ROOM
text: She spins, frightened by the door that closed behind her. To
dialog: her left...
text: A WINDOW crashes shut, startling her. Then, like a wave
text: moving in a circle around her, another WINDOW bangs down, a
text: DOOR slams shut, another WINDOW. Scared, RACHEL backs into
speaker_heading: A CLOSET

text: The CLOSET DOOR swings shut, sealing her off from the world.
speaker_heading: FROM ABOVE

scene_heading: EXT. A HOUSE - MORNING

text: RACHEL and MONICA chat with AMY and two other PATIO GIRLS.
text: AMY takes RACHEL 's hand.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I really like your nail color.
speaker_heading: MONICA
text: Check out the tattoo on her arm
dialog: wild huh?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah. Did that hurt?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No. Well, yeah, actually some.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh, it's just too cool.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm dying to get one, but my mom
dialog: would have a shit fit.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So would mine. She says I'm not
dialog: that type of gi rl.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What type is that?
text: There's an awkward pause which MONICA breaks.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: A slut.
dialog: (throws an arm around Rachel)
dialog: That's why you should take all
dialog: of us in for tattoos!
text: AMY and the other GIRLS laugh. RACHEL softens, joining in.
text: She looks around at everyone at the party, laughing, dancing.
text: The shiny, happy people. it feels weird, but here she is.
text: She smiles, takes a sip of her drink.
text: By the stereo, MARK cranks up the music as CHUCK dances over
text: to AMY, pulls her into the dancing CROWD. BRAD grabs MONICA.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: C'mon, wench, let's dance.
text: He pulls MONICA into the crowd, and she gestures for RACHEL
dialog: to join them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No, I'd rather wait for Jesse.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Oh, c'mon, Rachel. He'd want you
dialog: to have fun.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah, c'mon, Rach.
text: There's a chorus of "C'mon, Rachel" from the guys and some of
text: the other DANCERS join in. An embarrassed RACHEL surrenders,
text: sets down her drink and enters the dancing group.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: All right, girl.
text: RACHEL smiles. BRAD starts dancing before RACHEL.
text: SLOW MOTION -- CLOSE on RACHEL's face, dancing, beaming. For
text: a few moments, everything seems perfect. And she throws her
text: head back and laughs.
text: MARK dances into the group.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hey, Chuckzilla, why don't you
dialog: put on the highlights tape?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You mean tonight's game?
text: MARK shares a laugh and a glance with MONICA and B
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah, tonight's game.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Okay. Let's go to the videotape:
text: He dances out of the group over to the VCR where he pops out
text: a tape and inserts a tape marked "Bulldogs Highlights".
text: RACHEL turns around, sees the large screen TV PLAYING images
text: of the Bulldogs playing football.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Is that tonight's game?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, it's the other game.
text: Still dancing, she turns back to the group.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What other game?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The game you were in.
text: The others laugh. She smiles, confused.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: The one you played.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah, yeah, what was the score?
dialog: Chuckie, pass me the scoreboard,
dialog: I wanna show Rachel how she helped
text: Jesse win the game.
text: CHUCK pulls the BLACK NOTEBOOK next to the CD's off a shelf,
text: pretends he's a quarterback hiking a ball.
dialog: Twenty-four, twenty-six, hut, hut,
dialog: hut.
text: He drops back to pass the NOTEBOOK.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Go long, Bradzilla.
text: MARK laughs as BRAD circles around RACHEL, twists between
text: other dancers. CHUCK tosses the NOTEBOOK over RACHEL and
text: BRAD leaps up to catch it.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Post-pattern, Mark!
text: Ducking around DANCERS, MARK raises his hands for the pass.
text: KIDS start to notice their antics and start laughing.
text: BRAD passes the book over to MARK who catches it, mimes
text: spiking it for a touchdown and does a silly victory dance.
text: MONICA laughs and turns to RACHEL, who laughs, even though
text: she still looks a bit befuddled.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Rachel, catch!
text: He throws the NOTEBOOK through the air, where it tumbles end
text: over end for a few slow beats, then is caught by her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
scene_heading: BEHIND RACHEL --
text: THE TV SET -- keeps playing football highlights, but suddenly
dialog: there's an almost subliminal --
text: FLASH of TWO INTERTWINED BODIES.
text: RACHEL holds the NOTEBOOK, unsure of what to do with it. The
text: boys are a little out of breath, but still grinning and
dialog: dancing.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Open it. Go 'head, read off the
dialog: scores.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Start with Eric.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Yeah, start with poor Eric.
text: She opens the book, looks at the pages with a quizzical
text: expression. She sees the Bulldog names across the top of the
text: page with lists of girls beneath each one. Every girl has a
text: number next to her with a total at the bottom.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What's Eric's score?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Twenty-two?
text: RACHEL stops dancing as she spots LISA PARKER's name at the
text: bottom of ERIC's column with the number four next to it.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What's up, Rach? You know someone on
dialog: that list?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Lisa.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh, yeah, Lisa, forgot about her.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: How many points was she?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Four. But maybe he shoulda lost
dialog: those when she offed herself.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Rach, look under Jesses's name, how
dialog: many points you get?
speaker_heading: MONICA
speaker_heading: (CHEERLEADING)
dialog: Two, four, six, eight--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Who do we appreciate!
text: RACHEL looks down JESSES's column sees-her name with thirty
text: points next to it, then, above hers, sees TRACY with ten.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, more than that, remember, we
dialog: thought Rach was a dyke. He got
dialog: extra-points for the conversion.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: points?
dialog: Try thirty.
text: RACHEL stares at the book, stunned, trying to make sense of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Look at her face, this is priceless.
text: At the front door, JESSE walks in, TRACY behind him. He
text: looks around, hasn't seen what's going on yet. ERIC
text: intercepts him, turning JESSE away from the TV.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Hey, man, what did the scout say?
text: Behind Rte...
text: THE TV SET -- between shots of players grunting, tackling
text: and smashing into each other, longer and longer segments
dialog: appear of...
scene_heading: A COUPLE MAKING LOVE --
text: from the waist up, with thick scan lines that almost make it
text: look surreal. It's obvious that the girl is RACHEL, and the
dialog: boy is JESSE.
text: DANCING KIDS notice what's on the TV and start to point and
text: laugh at the set. RACHEL is completely unaware of what's
text: going on behind her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: See, we didn't think Jess could do i
dialog: so he offered to get evidence, proof
dialog: that he'd scored you.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Here comes Jesse's big play!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Lookie, lookie, Rachel.
text: RACHEL realizes people are watching something behind her,
text: then laughing at her. She turns and sees...
text: The IMAGES of her and JESSE on the TV.
text: Her face goes slack with horror.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh, God
text: MARK leans in to RACHEL, who hasn't noticed JESSE.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Jess was disappointed with the picture
dialog: quality, but I told him it was better
text: than Pam and Tommy Lee's tape.
speaker_heading: CK
dialog: Rach, was it good for you too?
dialog: Sure looks like it, don't it?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Why don't we ask Jesse?
text: He turns and calls out.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Jesse! Over here!
text: JESSE looks over and his eyes meet RACHEL's, but she just
text: stares back, horrified. Then he sees the TV set behind her
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: What...
text: JESSE pushes his way through the crowd, trying to get to
text: RACHEL. TRACY throws an arm around him, kisses his neck.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: He told me he was thinking of me
dialog: when he fucked you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
text: Seeing MARK laughing, JESSE realizes what's going on.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Rachel...
text: He tries to shrug off TRACY, but ERIC and CHUCK grab his arms
text: and pull him back into the crowd.
speaker_heading: JESSE
dialog: Rachel!
text: MARK pushes RACHEL towards BRAD.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Rachel! Rachel!
text: She tries to get away, but BRAD pushes her into MONICA who
text: shoves her to AMY as they join in the chanting.
dialog: Rachel!
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Rachel!
dialog: Rachel!
text: Drowning out JESSE's cries.
text: RACHEL's P.Q.V. -- spinning around. A NIGHTMARISH GALLERY of
text: dancing, jostling torsos, TWISTED FACES and LAUGHING MOUTHS,
text: smirking and pointing at her.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
speaker_heading: FAST CLOSE-UPS
text: of RACHEL and JESSE making love. The assault of music,
text: chanting and images crescendo with...
text: BRAD grabbing RACHEL's bare arm below her HEART-THORN TATTOO
text: forcing her to face the TV screen.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Hey, is that a zit on your ass?
text: RACHEL has tears streaming down her face for the first time
dialog: since she was four years old.
text: She bows her head.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
text: A LAUGHING BRAD
text: glances down at RACHEL's arm.
text: The THORN VINE around the HEART TATTOO looks bigger, edging
text: up her arm.
text: He looks away, shares a laugh with MARK, looks back and...
scene_heading: THE HEART TATTOO
text: on RACHEL's upper arm is growing, etched from within, the
text: thorn covered vine snaking like a tendril up her arm.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Holy shit.
text: He releases her.
text: RACHEL raises her head, eyes glowing with pain and rage, her
dialog: broken heart turned to stone.,
text: The delicate THORN VINE has grown across her chin, cheekbone
text: and forehead, swirling around to end on her other cheek.
text: A stunned BRAD backs away from her.
text: JESSE breaks free of ERIC's grip, slugs CHUCK and pushes his
text: way towards RACHEL.
text: Her HEART POUNDS at an alarming rate as she slowly turns and
text: sees JESSE coming at her, his arms out to take her in his
dialog: embrace.
speaker_heading: A KNIFE
text: on the bar dances and rattles, then...
text: A WHIP PAN finds...
text: JESSE, as his back arches in pain and he screams. The KNIFE
text: embedded in his open palm, nailing his hand to the wall.
text: MARK and the other boys stare in shock.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What the fuck?
text: ON JESSE -- as he screams again.
text: A CORKSCREW has pierced his other hand, at waist level. The
text: SCREW spins around, burrowing into his flesh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
text: Everyone on that side of the room stops dead, taking in the
text: bizarre sight.
text: RACHEL straightens up and...
text: The kitchen door CLOSES...
text: The glass doors to the back yard slide SHUT...
text: The front door SLAMS.
speaker_heading: TRACY
scene_heading: (LOOKING AROUND)
dialog: What's going on Mark?
dialog: I dunno.
text: The floor starts to shake like a small earthquake. All the
text: PARTYGOERS go still, looking around at each other. The room
text: is frozen, even though the music keeps pounding.
text: MARK looks at RACHEL, her disheveled hair partially obscures
text: her features, but her eyes are glowing.
scene_heading: THE GLASS WINDOWS
text: surrounding the room, begin to RATTLE, then CRACK in a spider-
dialog: web pattern. Then...
text: THE WINDOWS BURST inward.
text: FOLLOW the deadly hail of shards as they cut through the
speaker_heading: CROWD.
text: FROM ABOVE -- The outer edge of the CROWD are mowed down as
dialog: if by a machine gun and...
text: A WHIP PAN -- Finds a BOY impaled by a large, jagged shard.
scene_heading: TWISTED SHADOWS
text: are splayed across a wall of KIDS falling to the ground. The
text: hard-edged music keeps playing while...
text: CHUCK's decapitated head rolls across the floor and onto...
text: A plate.
text: The BEEFY BOY spins around, clutcning at a shard protruding
text: from his neck, his carotid artery spewing blood like a lawn
text: sprinkler.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
text: On a GIRL as his blood sprays across her face and...
text: The BOY turns, arcing blood across...
text: The Jackson Pollock PAINTING, which blends into the multi-
text: colored canvas.
text: Reeling into the stereo, the BOY scatters CDs everywhere.
text: On RACHEL, clothes spattered red, tears streaming down her
dialog: cheeks.
text: TRACY straightens up, having been protected by MONICA, who`s
text: screaming, her face a lacerated pulp with glass, shards
text: sticking out of it like a pincushion.
text: Surviving PARTYGOERS panic as they struggle to their feet and
text: try to flee, stampeding over each other.
text: , TRACY, ERIC and BRAD shove their way through the crowd.
scene_heading: EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: As SUE and BAR.BA k leap from the Volvo.. SUE hears the

dialog: windows.
speaker_heading: SUE BARBARA
dialog: Oh, not Rachel!
text: They race to the door as...
scene_heading: WITHIN THE HOUSE
text: BRAD runs to the front door.
text: An IRON FIREPLACE POKER lifts up one end, then flies like a

speaker_heading: DOOR - N
text: BARBARA and SUE approach the door when the end of the

text: BARBARA in the face as it sticks out about a foot.
text: She jerks back, then pushes the door open with an effort.
scene_heading: WITHIN THE HOUSE --
text: They enter and freeze as the door slams shut behind them,
text: revealing a dead BRAD speared through the throat, pinned to
text: the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
dialog: Oai, my god. Where's Rachel?
text: They see JESSE, then RACHEL covered in tattoos.
text: A panicked itMY smashes into BARBARA, then runs toward a
dialog: window.
text: RACHEL sees AMY and her eyes narrow...
text: MUSIC CDs fly off a shelf and...
text: Spin through the air at high velocity.
text: One of the deadly frisbees buries itself in AMY's back,
text: spinning her around. More CDs embed in her stomach, chest
dialog: and throat.
text: MARK and ERIC smash their way through the chaos as MARK's
text: eyes flash from a collapsing AMY to RACHEL
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: God, it'ls her! She's doing it!
text: SUE moves towards RACHEL.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Stop! Stop it!
text: RACHEL has her gaze locked on...
text: MARK, who realizes he's a dead man. He moves toward a
text: shattered window, through which some PEOPLE escape.
text: But RACHEL turns her head slightly and...
text: A TELEKINETIC PULSE travels across the row of LIQUOR BOTTLES
text: at the bar, exploding them one-by-one, spraying alcohol which
text: douses SUE.
text: A FLAMING LOG erupts from the fireplace...
text: Striking the alcohol-drenched BAR, setting a blazing trail
text: and lighting the curtains on fire, creating a wall of FLAMES
text: before the windows.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Stop it! You don't want to--
text: And RACHEL snaps her head around, launching another LOG from
text: the fireplace which strikes SUE in the back, whose alcohol
text: drenched clothes catch flames... and she , A.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
text: A screaming SUE pitches forward, rolls on the floor to put
text: out the flames, but caly succeeds in lighting another trail
text: of liquor which creates a barrier to the backyard windows.
text: In the eye of the storm is BARBARA, shaking her head in
text: denial, muttering, as her mental state rapidly deteriorates.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No, this isn't happening. It isn't
dialog: happening, isn't happening...
text: MARK pulls ERIC by the shirt collar and they careen down...
speaker_heading: A HALLWAY
text: where each of the DOORS ahead of them SLAM SHUT as they
dialog: approach.
text: Utter CHAOS, but RACHEL calmly turns into the hallway,
text: following MARK, as if in a trance.
dialog: I
speaker_heading: MARK
text: lowers his shoulder, crashes through a closing door into.
speaker_heading: A DEN
text: where the walls are decorated with deer heads and hunting

text: containing pistols and rifles.
text: TRACY leans panting against the wall.

scene_heading: EXTâ¢ THE BACK YARD - NIGHT
text: Where they almost stumble into the swimming pool.
text: Toting their rifles, MARK, ERIC and TRACY turn to find
text: RACHEL, at a gunfighter's distance, coming towards them.
text: TRACY and BRAD cock their weapons and bring them to their
text: shoulders. TRACY slips on her glasses.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Wait till she's closer.
text: TRACY tightens her finger on the trigger.
text: RACHEL's eyes narrow and...
text: TRACY's glasses shatter into her eyes, spewing blood
text: milky fluid.
dialog: Aaaaa...
text: She staggers, fires her shotgun into ERIC's groin and he
text: lands sitting next to the pool. A dying ERIC stares at his
text: shredded lap, then falls over.
text: MARK looks at his dead friend.
dialog: Oh, shit.
text: .recovers, and swings his aim back at RACHEL. But his
text: rifle goes sailing over his head and into the grass twenty
text: feet behind him.
text: He makes eye-contact with a grim RACHEL advancing toward him,
text: and hauls ass.
text: RACHEL glances at a coiled GARDEN HOSE and it springs to
text: life, slithering through the grass and across the concrete at
text: high speed to wrap around MARK's ankle and trip him up.
text: He hits the ground hard and rolls over to find the hose
text: twisting around his legs and up his waist like a python.
speaker_heading: HIS HAND
text: grasps for the rifle, but falls short as the hose pins his
text: other arm to his side, then curls around his windpipe in a
text: stranglehold.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
text: His eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees
text: RACHEL standing over him.
text: He gropes for the shotgun again... and finally grabs it.
text: RACHEL looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold,
text: splashing into the pool.
text: But she jolts on two...
speaker_heading: GUNSHOTS
text: RACHEL looks down. MARK had pulled the handgun from his belt
text: with his pinned hand and fired.
text: She's holding her belly, gutshot, staggers and falls into the
text: pool, disappearing amid a swirl of blood.
text: MARK yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack. He
text: gasps, points the gun into the pool and FIRES until it's
text: silent and he's left pulling the trigger on empty chambers.
text: He gets his breatking under control, leans over to look into
text: the water of the deep end. He Aar on the sound of a
text: mechanical whirring, and turns.
text: A POOL COVER starts to unfold.
dialog: At that moment...
scene_heading: RACHEL'S BLOODY ARM
text: bursts from the water and grips his neck. MARK grabs her
text: forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool.
scene_heading: UNDERWATER --
text: As RACHEL drags MARK down, he kicks and pummels her, but she
text: holds on. The POOL COVER steadily closes over them, shutting
text: out the light from above.
text: MARK finally frees himself and lunges for the surface, but
text: the POOL COVER blocks his escape.
text: He desperately pushes at it, eyes bulging, lungs burning, as
text: his feet kick to keep him afloat.
dialog: ON THE SURFACE --
text: The POOL COYER closing as RACHEI, hauls herself from the
text: water, barely making it out. MARK'S HAND, grabs her leg,

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
text: M RX's head bulges the POOL COVER, then his hands punch
text: feebly at it a few times. Then... nothing.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (O.S.)
dialog: Rachel!
text: A weakened RACHEL lays by the pool. She seems to be snapping
text: out of her trance as she rolls over and sees BARBARA.
text: RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet, scared

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Mama. Maury?
speaker_heading: BARBARA'S P.O.V. o

text: He sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach, then follows her
dialog: gaze to...
speaker_heading: THE TV SET
text: with a cracked screen, but still playing the tape of their

speaker_heading: (COUGHS)
dialog: Rachel. Gat out, now. Go.
text: And the KNIFE and the CORKSCREW drop away, releasing him.

text: to hear. She whispers again...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: .love you.
text: JESSE tenderly kisses her lips.
text: And all the TATTOOS fade from her face and body
dialog: Love.

dialog: nightmare.
text: JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the

dialog: open.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Leave. Get out
text: Instead of leaving her, JESSE hugs RACHEL closer. The sleeve

text: RACHEL shuts her eyes, gives one last TELEKINETIC PUSH...
scene_heading: EXT. THE BACKYARD - NIGHT
