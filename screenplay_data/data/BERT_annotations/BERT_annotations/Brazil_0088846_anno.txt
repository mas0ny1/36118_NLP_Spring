dialog: Screenplay (Draft)
scene_heading: 1 EXT. CITYSCAPE					SUNSET		 1
text: A beautiful golden sun is setting. The sky is on fire. The
text: CAMERA starts to move downwards. A large neon sign rises
text: into shot. It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the
text: frame. The building is neither past nor future in design
dialog: but a bit of both.
dialog: 
text: Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads
text: below ... A glittering conglomeration of elevated
text: transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely
text: huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule
text: relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level
text: awnings suggesting restaurants and shops ... Transparent
text: tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us ... an
text: elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of
text: large transport lorries passes thru frame. As we descend,
text: the sunlight is blocked out and street lights & neon signs
text: take over as illumination. Eventually we reach the upper
text: levels of a plush shopping precinct.
scene_heading: 2 INT. SHOPPING PRECINT			 NIGHT		 2
dialog: 
text: Xmas decorations are everywhere. PEOPLE are busy buying,
text: ogling, discussing, choosing wisely from the goodies on
text: display. SHOPPERS are going by laden with superbly
text: packaged goods ... the shop windows are full of
text: elaborately boxed and be-ribboned who-knows-what. In one
text: window is a bank of TV sets - on the great majority of the
text: screens is the face of MR. HELPMANN - the Deputy Minister
text: of Information. He is being interviewed. No-one bothers to
speaker_heading: listen to HELPMANN.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: Deputy minister, what do you believe
dialog: is behind this recent increase in
dialog: terrorist bombings?
speaker_heading: HELPMANN
text: Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless
dialog: minority of people seems to have
dialog: forgotten certain good old fashioned
dialog: virtues. They just can't stand seeing
dialog: the other fellow win. If these people
dialog: would just play the game, instead of
text: standing on the touch line heckling -
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: In fact, killing people -
speaker_heading: HELPMANN
dialog: - In fact, killing people - they'd
dialog: get a lot more out of life.
text: We PULL AWAY from the shop to concentrate on the shoppers.
text: HELPMANN's voice carries over the rest of the scene.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to
dialog: those critics who maintain that the
dialog: Ministry Of Information has become
dialog: too large and unwieldy ...?
speaker_heading: HELPMANN
dialog: David ... in a free society
dialog: information is the name of the game.
dialog: You can't win the game if you're a
dialog: man short.
text: Fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be
text: banks of snow but as we pan along with them the "snow"
text: turns out to be fire-fighting foam. It oozes out of a shop
text: front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames.
text: WORKMEN are busily sealing the opening with plywood
text: sheets, SHOPPERS pay no attention to this. Xmas carols are
text: being played by a Salvation Army style band calling
text: themselves Consumers For Christ. Santa Claus's grotto is
text: busy, all is well with the world.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: And the cost of it all, Deputy
dialog: Minister? Seven percent of the gross
dialog: national produce ...
speaker_heading: HELPMANN
dialog: I understand this concern on behalf
dialog: of the tax-payers. People want value
dialog: for money and a cost-effective
dialog: service.
scene_heading: 3 INT. OFFICE					 NIGHT		 3
text: CUT TO TV screen with HELPMANN still talking.
speaker_heading: HELPMANN
dialog: That is why we always insist on the
dialog: principle of Information Retrieval
dialog: Charges. These terrorists are not
dialog: pulling their weight, and it's
dialog: absolutely right and fair that those
dialog: found guilty should pay for their
dialog: periods of detention and the
dialog: Information Retrieval Procedures used
text: in their interrogation.
text: PULL BACK to reveal a rather clinical office. The TV rests
text: on a desk. A WHITE COATED TECHNICIAN is sorting out his in-
text: tray. Several Christmas cards are amongst he paperwork. He
text: comes upon a Christmassy package which he rips open, to
text: discover a shiny, metal "executive toy".
text: CUT TO the BEETLE droning up near the ceiling.
text: The TECHNICIAN is disturbed by the buzz of the BEETLE as
text: it whirrs around the fluorescent light. He rolls up some
text: paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect.
text: Scenes 4-12 Deleted.						4-12 Deleted.
scene_heading: 13 INT. OFFICE					 NIGHT		 13
dialog: 
text: The TECHNICIAN gets up and balances a chair on top of his
text: desk. He climbs up onto it attempting to swat the BEETLE
text: still buzzing about the room just out of reach. Beneath
text: him an automatic type-writing machine rattles away
dialog: compiling a typed list of names under the heading
dialog: "Information Retrieval, Subjects For Detention &
text: Interview". The machine is being fed from a spool of paper
text: which is being rhythmically chopped by an automatic
text: guillotine which neatly leaves each name on a separate
text: sheet, with the title above each name, each sheet
text: following its predecessor into a holding basket. In CLOSE-
text: UP we see the names on the sheets of paper building up in
text: the holding basket: TONSTED, Simon ... TOPPER, Martin F.
text: ... TROLLOPE, Benjamin G. ... TURB, William K. ... TURNER,
dialog: John D. ... Every name begins with T.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: Do you think that the government is
dialog: winning the battle against
dialog: terrorists?
speaker_heading: HELPMANN
dialog: On yes. Our morale is much higher
dialog: than theirs, we're fielding all their
dialog: strokes, running a lot of them out,
dialog: and pretty consistently knocking them
dialog: for six. I'd say they're nearly out
dialog: of the game.
dialog: 
text: The TECHNICIAN is tottering on one leg on the chair on the
text: desk as he strains to swat the BEETLE. Swish, swash, oops,
dialog: WHAP! Gottcha!!
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: But the bombing campaign is now in
dialog: its thirteenth year ...
speaker_heading: HELPMANN
dialog: Beginner's luck.
text: The BEETLE's career comes to a halt ... squashed flat on
dialog: the brilliantly clean ceiling ... or has it? As the
text: TECHNICIAN clambers down from the rickety heights, the
text: BEETLE's carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops
text: silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs,
text: hesitates and then types the letter "B" and hesitates and
text: then continues so that the next name is BUTTLE, Archibald.
text: The TECHNICIAN fails to notice this and the machine
text: continues smoothly TUTWOOD, Thomas T. ... TUZCZLOW,
dialog: Peter...
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER
dialog: Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
speaker_heading: HELPMANN
dialog: Thank you, David ... and a very merry
dialog: Christmas to you all.

text: ZOOMING past foreground outdoor Xmas decorations we
text: TIGHTEN in on one of several massive residential tower
text: blocks that loom over what appears to be a poorer part of
dialog: the city
scene_heading: 15 INT. BUTTLE FLAT				 NIGHT		 15
dialog: 
text: HELPMANN and INTERVIEWER are on the TV, the end credits
text: rolling over them to the beat of a Mozart theme tune.
text: PULLING BACK we reveal that the TV is in a conventional
text: sitting room, conventionally decorated for Christmas; out
text: the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that
text: snake unpleasantly across and through the walls. Smaller
text: conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various
dialog: services that Central Services (the name emblazoned on the
text: metal) supply to this household. A conventionally poor but
text: proud family occupies the room. MRS BUTTLE is reading
text: Dickens' Christmas Carol to GIRL BUTTLE who is about six.
text: BOY BUTTLE plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some
text: action men dressed in security gear. MR. BUTTLE is putting
text: the final touches to a neatly wrapped Christmas present
text: which looks identical to the "executive toy" we have just
text: seen in he TECHNICIAN'S office.
text: Faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter. A tilt of
text: the CAMERA indicates that the laughter is coming from the
text: floor above.
scene_heading: 16 INT. JILL'S FLAT				 NIGHT		 16
text: The flat is very bare and basic. The laughter is coming
text: from a cheap portable television showing "Sgt. Bilko. From
text: BILKO'S POV we look through an open door of a bathroom
text: straight at a mirror propped up by the bath, to enable the
text: person in the bath to watch the TV. The person in the bath
text: is JILL LAYTON, washing the grime off herself while she
text: watches Bilko in the mirror. From her POV in the mirror,
text: the T.V. screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body
text: of a MAN in uniform.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (scared)
dialog: Who's there?
scene_heading: 17 INT. BUTTLE'S FLAT				 NIGHT		 17
dialog:

speaker_heading: MRS BUTTLE
dialog: There, that's enough for tonight. He
dialog: won't come Xmas Eve if you don't get

speaker_heading: GIRL BUTTLE
dialog: Father Christmas can't come if we

speaker_heading: MRS BUTTLE
dialog: You'll see.
text: The GIRL exchanges goodnight kisses with her parents and

speaker_heading: GIRL BUTTLE
dialog: How will he get down from upstairs?
speaker_heading: BOY BUTTLE
dialog: It's a secret.
text: We follow GIRL BUTTLE out of the sitting room into ...
scene_heading: 18 INT. HALLWAY AND CHILDREN'S BEDROOM	NIGHT		 18
text: GIRL BUTTLE enters her bedroom. There is little or no
text: light there, and she sees a bulky figure apparently
text: lowering himself into the room from the direction of the
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: GIRL BUTTLE
dialog: (unalarmed)
dialog: You've come ...
text: As she moves, the light from the hallway shows us the
text: figure of what looks like a commando on a night raid,
text: slowly sliding down a pole in he middle of the room. The
text: pole at the top end disappears through a hole in the
text: ceiling. Things become immediately clearer
scene_heading: 19 INT. BUTTLE SITTING-ROOM			NIGHT		 19
text: Crash! It's a raid! Battle-dressed SECURITY TROOPS smash
text: trough the door. Another ONE, swings from a rope, kicks in
text: the window from the outside and enters that way. Most
text: alarmingly of all, a shower of plaster comes down from the
text: ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and
text: through the hole comes a fireman's pole down which slide
text: TWO MORE SECURITY TROOPS. The whole thing is short, brutal
dialog: and violent.
dialog: 
text: BUTTLE is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike
text: canvas device that covers him from head to waist. A metal
text: clamp goes round his neck, a metal bar slides up the back
text: of the bag. His hands are handcuffed to the metal bar. In
text: seconds he has become a canvas parcel. Meanwhile, GIRL
text: BUTTLE has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into
text: the lap of her screaming mother. BOY BUTTLE has his toy
text: machine gun knocked out of his hands by a TROOPER who we
text: see is identical in dress to the action men BOY BUTTLE has
text: been playing with. He rushes to his mother as guns are
text: viciously trained on them. TROOPS are kicking open the
text: doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job. An
text: OFFICIAL, wearing plain clothes, now enters from the front
text: door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an
dialog: official document. It goes something like this:
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: I hereby inform you under powers
dialog: entrusted to me under Section 47,
dialog: Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number
dialog: 438476, that Mr Buttle, Archibald,
dialog: residing at 412 North Tower, Shangri

dialog: completion of application form
dialog: BZ/ST/486/C fourteen days within this
dialog: date, and that he is liable to
dialog: certain obligations as specified in
dialog: Council Order 173497, including
dialog: financial restitutions which may or
dialog: may not be incurred if Information
dialog: Retrieval procedures beyond those
dialog: incorporated in Article 7 subsections
dialog: 8, 10 & 32 are required to elicit
dialog: information leading to permanent
dialog: arrest - notification of which will

dialog: working days as stipulated by law. In
dialog: that instance the detainee will be
dialog: debited without further notice
dialog: through central banking procedures
dialog: without prejudice until and unless at
dialog: such a time when re-imbursement
dialog: procedures may be instituted by you
dialog: or third parties on completion of a
scene_heading: re-imbursement form RB/CZ/907/X ...
text: ... and more of the same, most of which is part of the
text: audible wall paper while the chaos reigns. As the front
text: door slams behind the captive relative peace returns,
text: broken by MRS BUTTLE's anguished sobbing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
text: (proffering a pen and a

dialog: to Mrs Buttle)
dialog: Sign here please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS BUTTLE

dialog: What? where have you taken him?
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: (taking the book)
dialog: thank you.

dialog: this one of blue receipts)
dialog: (indicating place to sign)
dialog: Same again please. Just there.
dialog: (checking first book of
dialog: receipts)
dialog: Press harder his time. Good.
speaker_heading: MRS BUTTLE
dialog: (signing again)
dialog: What is this all about?
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: (tearing out sheet from
dialog: pink book)
dialog: That's your receipt for your husband.
dialog: (taking blue book from her)
dialog: Thank you. And this is my receipt for
dialog: your receipt.
text: (he turns to leave along
dialog: with troopers)
text: JILL's shocked face appears looking down through the hole
text: in the ceiling. The faces of the workmen BILL and CHARLIE
text: also appear, above and behind her.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
text: The helmeted SECURITY TROOPS in Buttle's flat drop to
text: defensive positions and swing their machine guns up
text: towards the hole in the ceiling. All three faces retreat.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (starting back from the
dialog: hole with Bill and Jill)
dialog: Eh! Eh! Eh! We're Department of
dialog: Works! Department of Works up here!
dialog: Careful with those bloody things!
dialog: 
text: JILL, CHARLIE and BILL are hustled aside by a SECURITY MAN
text: who clears the fireman's pole from the hole. We can see
text: the TROOPS in the room below leaving. A SECOND SECURITY
text: man has untied a rope hanging out of the open window. He
text: coils the rope up neatly and the TWO SECURITY MEN leave
dialog: the flat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Jill as they watch this
dialog: highly efficient operation)
dialog: Don't take any notice, love, it's
dialog: their training makes them like

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Who are you?

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: It's Buttle downstairs who can worry,

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: There must be some mistake ... Mr

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We don't make mistakes.
dialog: 
text: So saying, he drops the manhole cover, which is faced with
text: same material as the floor, over the hole in the floor. To
text: his surprise it drops neatly through the floor into the
dialog: flat below.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Bloody typical, they've gone back to

scene_heading: 20a INT. BUTTLES' FLAT				 NIGHT		20a
dialog: 
text: MRS BUTTLE stands stunned in the middle of her decimated
text: flat. The KIDS wail. Slowly MRS BUTTLE collapses -
text: slumping to the floor with the receipt in her hand: we
text: tighten into CLOSE UP of "Receipt".
speaker_heading: JILL (off CAMERA)
dialog: Mrs Buttle? Mrs Buttle?
scene_heading: 21 INT. RECORD CLERK'S POOL						 21
dialog: 
text: We come in on a CLOSE UP of a pink version of the RECEIPT
text: being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we PULL OUT to
text: reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal
text: desks, each desk with a built-in T.V. console, and each
text: (except one) occupied by a CLERK. Every desk is snowed
text: under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in
text: the previous scene. More pacers are delivered to each desk
text: intermittently by way of pneumatic tube. OFFICE BOYS
text: bustle about with even more paperwork. From the back of
text: the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs,
dialog: tabulations, figures ... All of this activity is
text: supervised from an elevated walkway by MR KURTZMAN.
text: Satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and
text: walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top
text: of the room, his name lettered on the opaque glass door.
text: MR KURTZMAN goes through this door and as he closes it
text: behind him, all activity in the CLERKS pool ceases. each
text: CLERK adjusts his T.V. screen with the flick of a switch,
text: and all the screens change to something which looks very
dialog: like "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly".
scene_heading: 22 INT. MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE			DAY		 22
dialog: 
text: MR KURTZMAN also has a T.V. console. He sits behind his
text: desk, reaches for his In-tray, and without looking at the
text: console he turns his screen on. He looks through a number
text: of files in his In-tray. He is surprised to hear a VOICE
text: say, "Turn around real slow, amigo". MR KURTZMAN turns
text: around real slow, his expression relaxes, he thumps his
text: T.V. console with a large fist, and the screen obediently
text: flicks to a display of figures. He picks up a file which
text: we see as marked "Buttle, Archibald". He opens the file
text: and starts punching the keyboard of the console. The T.V.
text: starts bleeping in an alarmed way. MR KURTZMAN is puzzled.
text: He punches more figures. The screen starts to flash
text: "Error, error, error". MR KURTZMAN sighs with frustration.
text: He presses an intercom.
speaker_heading: MR KURTZMAN
dialog: (into intercom)
dialog: Mr Lowry, will you step in here
dialog: please?
dialog: 
text: He returns his attention, puzzled to the file. Nobody
text: comes into the office. MR KURTZMAN gets up and walks over
text: to his door and opens it. Beyond the door the room full of
text: CLERKS is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and
text: whirring consoles. From MR KURTZMAN'S POV we see that in
text: the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk.
speaker_heading: MR KURTZMAN
dialog: Does anyone know where Lowry is?
text: Nobody knows. MR KURTZMAN closes his door again. A moment
dialog: later it seems to him, and to us, that he has heard the
text: crash of six guns blazing away at each other. He re-opens
text: the door. The only sound again. He goes back to his desk.
text: He punches a few keys. The machine starts emitting even
text: more alarming beeps, then horse whinnies, then "Admit
text: you're whupped, you drygulching scum". KURTZMAN explodes
text: with anger, and presses the intercom again.
speaker_heading: MR KURTZMAN
dialog: (Shouting into intercom)
dialog: Where the hell is Sam Lowry?!
scene_heading: 23 EXT. SKY						 DAY		 23
dialog: 
text: CUT TO brilliantly clear sky. From on high an odd bird-
text: like figure swoops down on the CAMERA. As it comes closer
text: we can see that it is, in fact, a MAN wearing strange wood
text: and metal bird wings. In the bright sunshine their
text: flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect.
text: Along with the wings, SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an
text: outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI
text: fighter pilot. He sweeps past the CAMERA and then,
text: banking, rises BACK INTO SHOT IN MCU. An ethereal voice
text: can be heard calling "Sam ... Sam ... Sam". He hovers,
text: looking beyond the CAMERA to something wonderful. CUT TO
text: face of stunningly beautiful GIRL, she is the idealised
text: twin of JILL LAYTON ... Her long hair swirls across her
text: face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly
text: mysterious. The CAMERA PULLS AWAY from her as soft
text: billowing material sinuously undulates about her. It rises
text: and falls like waves carried on the wind. As the CAMERA
text: GLIDES BACK through this sea of gossamer we can see that
text: the GIRL is being held aloft by and in it. A vast
text: landscape stretches below her. The sun frames her in the
text: sky. She and SAM are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial
dialog: ballet.
dialog: 
text: Romantic music fills the soundtrack.
dialog: 
text: SAM swoops up and away. The GIRL floats in the distance as
text: SAM. rises in the foreground. She beckons to him. SAM
text: begins to flap back towards her. But then the dreamy
text: quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening
text: rumble. SAM looks down.
dialog: 
text: The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive,
text: monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and
text: soars upwards with a mighty rush.
dialog: 
text: CUT to the GIRL in LONG SHOT. The monolith rises up into
text: FRAME partially cutting her off from view.
dialog: 
text: Before SAM can do anything, another stone skyscraper
text: breaks through the ground and rushes upwards. Then another
dialog: and another. There is nothing SAM can do. The GIRL is
text: being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless
text: structures. And then she is finally lost from view
text: somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis.
text: SAM lies closer. The stone skyscrapers appear to be solid.
dialog: No windows. No doors. Nothing whatsoever to interfere with
text: their clean, harsh, rectilinear design. As he flies among
text: these towering blocks he sees no sign of the GIRL, only
text: sheer walls rising high above him. Below him the walls
text: plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets. No sound
text: but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in
text: this dead place. Coming round a corner he sees something
text: in the distance. far below him a dark procession is
text: wending its way through the narrow passages... away from
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO LOW ANGLE SHOT of the procession making its way
text: past the CAMERA. Black-robed and cowled, the sinister
text: figures look like heavily armed monks. These are the
text: FORCES OF DARKNESS. Together they are straining at several
text: heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal
text: cage floating above and behind the procession. Binding the
text: cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached. Inside
text: is the GIRL - still enveloped in gossamer which billows as
dialog: if there were a breeze in constant attendance.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO SAM as He dives out of shot.
dialog: 
text: CUT to the FORCES OF DARKNESS suddenly stopping in their
dialog: tracks. They've seen something.
dialog: 
text: CUT to their POV. There at the end of the passage between
text: two stone skyscrapers stands SAM ... barring the way.
dialog: 
text: CUT to swords being unsheathed. Cowls being thrown back.
text: Underneath are rotting, broken dolls' faces. All the faces
dialog: are the same except for the manner in which they have
text: decayed. They smile - slobbering, sickeningly. Suddenly
text: the robed bodies change shape - some rising up to become
text: long, others expanding sideways to become bulbous, others
text: shrinking. From the folds of cloth come evil weapons. The
text: FORCES are massed ready to charge.
text: CUT to long shot of SAM. He removes his arms from his
text: wings and folds the wings behind him. He is ready.
dialog: 
text: Cut to the FORCES. Nothing moves ... except for the
text: constant dribble from their cracked mouths.
text: CUT back to SAM. Stillness. The tension is unbearable.
text: Suddenly SAM unleashes a terrifying scream and charges the
dialog: fearsome horde. Unarmed!
text: CUT to the FORCES thundering down to SAM. Weapons flailing
text: madly.
text: SAM skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading
text: field, and karate chops him senseless - at the same time
text: catching his sword as he falls. Spinning around he parries
text: a spearthrust and skewers a third attacker. Slash! Hack!
text: Stab! He lays waste to the FORCES. Nothing can stop this
text: boy. The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing
text: of SAM's sword. Wham! Bam! Smash! SAM carves his way
text: through the mob with nary a scratch. And then, suddenly,
text: they are all dead, but a heap of blackness to commemorate
text: SAM's prowess. The GIRL is beaming as SAM makes his way
text: toward the hawsers holding the cage. But then a noise
text: behind him makes him turn. There, behind him the pile of
text: black shapes begin to rise. The ropes become a mass of
text: flapping black cloth. This evil churning cloud coalesces
text: and lifts off the ground. The horrible flapping apparition
text: emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away. SAM
text: is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is
text: stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing. He looks
text: around - confused.
scene_heading: 24 INT. SAM'S BEDROOM				 MORNING		24
text: TIGHT SHOT of telephone. The ringing continues. A hand
text: grapples with the receiver. SAM is in bed in a darkened
text: room. Sleepily he drags receiver to his ear.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hello ... What ... what? Oh ... Mr
dialog: Kurtzman! ... You're up late. Oh, is
dialog: it?
text: There is an electronic box of tricks by his bed,
text: incorporating an alarm. SAM thumps it. The alarm goes off.
text: This sets of a series of other things ... The window
text: shutters roll up letting in the morning light. Both taps
dialog: turn on in the bathroom ...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: The electronics here are up the
dialog: spout. Yours too, sir? Don't worry
dialog: sir - I'll be there.
text: SAM puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is
text: moving towards him. Noticing one of his film posters is
text: loose he pushes the pin in firmly.
dialog: 
text: In the kitchen a coffee maker starts up. In the sitting
text: room the television switches on. Back in the bedroom a
text: cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with
text: SAM's clothes neatly hanging - ready to be put on. SAM
text: comes out of the bathroom, having turned off the bath
text: taps, and starts to get dressed. In the kitchen the coffee-
text: maker has finished making s small pot of coffee. SAM pours
text: a quick cup and is gone at the door. Throughout all this
text: we have had a chance to get a glimpse of SAM's flat. It is
text: functional, soulless and, though neat, has not been
text: assembled with a loving hand. Most of the furnishings are
text: built in. The walls are divided into two-foot square metal
text: panels painted a non-committal colour. Certain of the wall
text: panels have Central Services logos on them with the
text: admonition "Do not obstruct or remove" below. SAM has
text: livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film
text: posters. The sitting room sports several framed pictures
text: of wide beautiful vistas.

dialog: well, wonderful, marvelous, great
dialog: career prospects, Alison in great
dialog: shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm
dialog: on Security Level Five now, and Mr
dialog: Helpmann relies on me more and more,
dialog: yes, couldn't be better, I feel
dialog: terrifically motivated and job-
dialog: rewarded -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You sound worried.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Me? - if I'm worried about anyone,
dialog: it's you. What happened to you, Sam?
dialog: You were the brightest of us -
text: As they have been talking, a nearby bank of closed circuit
text: TV screens has been displaying shots of people entering
text: the lobby. As each one enters the CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT on
text: their faces for a frozen CLOSE-UP. JILL has just entered
text: and the CAMERA ZOOMS IN and freezes on her face. SAM
text: happens to glance up at this moment. He is startled - the
text: over-exposed TV image is the face of the GIRL FROM THE
text: DREAM. The face is only there a few seconds before being
text: replaced by another picture. SAM looks about to see where
text: the GIRL is, but JILL, in overalls, has her back to him as
text: she stands in the queue for the Information desk and so
text: there is no-one even vaguely reminiscent of the DREAM
text: GIRL. SAM decides he must have imagined it. Over this JACK
text: has been talking.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's the matter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sorry. Nothing.
dialog: (snapping out of it)
dialog: See you - I'm going to be late.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (looking at his watch)
dialog: You are late.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Even later.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sam, your life is going wrong - let
dialog: your friends tell you - Records is a
dialog: dead end department, no Security
dialog: Level worth a damn, it's impossible
dialog: to get noticed -
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous,
dialog: wonderful - remember me to Alison -
dialog: and the - er - twins.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Triplets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Really? - God, how time flies!
dialog: 
text: As SAM heads off to the lift, he passes a group of MEN
text: standing around a temporary TV monitor. Several of them
text: are dressed in white lab coats. They are being explained
dialog: the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman
text: type. His assistant is operating the controls. On the
text: monitor we can see JILL standing in the queue for the
text: Information desk. The CAMERA appears to he tracking in on
dialog: her.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO JILL at top of queue with several forms in her
text: hand. A strange prototype radio controlled camera on a
text: wheeled base is whirring and clicking as it approaches
text: her. Throughout the next sequence it pokes around JILL in
text: an annoying manner - thrusting itself at her face, trying
text: to see what is written on the forms, peering over her
text: shoulder. JILL hands a form to the Information Porter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I want to report a wrongful arrest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: (looking at form)
dialog: You want Information Adjustments.
dialog: Different department.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (exasperated but
dialog: controlled)
dialog: I've been to Information Adjustments.
dialog: They sent me here. They told me you
dialog: had a form I had to fill in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: Is it stamped?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (producing Buttle receipt)
dialog: Stamped?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: (examining receipt)
dialog: No, there's no stamp on it. You see!
dialog: I can't give you the form until it's
dialog: stamped.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Where do I get it stamped?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: Information Adjustments.
dialog: 
text: The radio-controlled camera noses right up to JILL's face
text: as she turns. She swats the annoying thing with her stack
text: of forms as she storms off. The camera overbalances and
text: crashes into the desk - sparking and spluttering.
dialog: 
text: CUTTING BACK to the GROUP around the monitor we see a
text: deeply hurt SALESMAN and several sceptical white-coated
speaker_heading: TECHNICIANS.

scene_heading: 26 INT. MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE			DAY		 26
dialog: 
text: SAM is busily working at the console, unraveling a problem
text: while KURTZMAN looks on anxiously and ineffectually.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Perhaps the machine's on the blink!
dialog: It keeps picking up old films. That
dialog: can't he right, can it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's not the machine. There's a
dialog: mismatch on the personnel code
dialog: numbers... Ah there we go! That's a
dialog: B58/732 when it should be a T47/215
dialog: ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06,
dialog: debited against his account for
dialog: electrical procedures, not Buttle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Oh my God, a mistake!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's not our mistake!

speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: Isn't it? Whose is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Information Retrieval.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Oh, good!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Expediting has put in for electrical

text: SAM is still punching keys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: What a relief! I don't know what I'd
dialog: do if you ever got promoted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Don't worry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: But if they did promote you
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I've told you before. I'd turn it
dialog: down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Would you really, Sam?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Really.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: (churned up)
dialog: You've been promoted.

scene_heading: 27 INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE				DAY		 27
dialog: 
text: CUT TO an old WOMAN's face reflected in triplicate in a
text: three-panelled mirror. A pair of MAN's hands have a grip
text: on her flabby cheeks, pulling them out several inches on
text: either side of her face. When I say several inches that's
dialog: just what I mean. Not only are her jowls being stretched
text: like silly putty but they are also being wrapped around to
text: the back of her neck to demonstrate how tight and smooth
text: her face can be made by DOCTOR who is prattling on over
dialog: this freak show.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Now, when you come in tomorrow, Mrs
dialog: Lowry, we'll make a little tuck here
dialog: ... and there ...
dialog: 
text: CUT TO WIDE SHOT of DOCTOR's surgery. It looks a bit like
text: a cross between an operating theatre and a boudoir. The
text: cold steel, glass and plastic surfaces are badly disguised
text: with pastel coloured chintz and satin. At the dressing
text: table sits the old WOMAN, SAM'S MOTHER. Behind her stands
text: the DOCTOR. He is much like his surgery. He has tailored
text: his surgical garments like a gigolo's dressing gown. It
text: seems that he has done a bit of tuck-taking on himself.
text: There is a certain plastic smoothness to his skin, but all
text: in all he has been fairly successful. SAM is pacing
text: around, raving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: I just wish you would stop
dialog: interfering, mother! I don't want
dialog: promotion. I'm happy where I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson
dialog: to you - he never had your brains but
dialog: he's got the ambition. You haven't
dialog: got the ambition but luckily you've
dialog: got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann
dialog: was very close -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Now, Mrs Lowry, don't get upset
dialog: (so SAM)
dialog: Please wait in reception, Mr Lowry,
dialog: you're giving her wrinkles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: You see!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (groans)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Now Mrs Lowry, try to relax. You must
dialog: trust me. I'll make you twenty years
dialog: younger ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Huh!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (giving Sam a dirty look)
dialog: ... twenty-five if we just drain the
dialog: excess fluid from the pouches ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Dr Jaffe, you're a genius. Would you
dialog: like to be Surgeon General? Four
dialog: Star. I know everybody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well they won't know you when I've
dialog: finished with you.
dialog: 
text: The DOCTOR reaches into his smock pocket for a coloured
text: marker. He starts colouring up her face with strokes of
text: different coloured markers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: First we must eliminate the excess
dialog: derma ... so! ... Then the flaccid
text: tissues under the eyes ... And now
dialog: the forehead ... Zip! I lift the
text: wrinkles and worry lines right up
text: into the wi- into the hairline, comme
dialog: ca ...
dialog: 
text: SAM looks disgusted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: And now the template ... There ...
dialog: there ... there ... Now a bit of
dialog: sticky ... There we go!
dialog: (triumphantly)
text: Already she is twice as beautiful as
dialog: she was before - voila!
dialog: 
text: The DOCTOR moves his body aside, revealing MRS LOWRY's
text: face, covered with coloured lines and wrapped in
text: cellophane held in shape by cellotape. SAM stares at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: My God, it works.

scene_heading: 28 INT. POSH RESTAURANT (ENTRANCE)	 DAY		 28
dialog: 
text: The conversation between SAM and his MOTHER takes place
text: while they are going through the sort of security checks
text: familiar at airports. They are, however, just outside the
text: velvet rope of the posh restaurant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (in full flow)
dialog: Mr Helpmann was very close to your
dialog: poor father. He was very close to me.
dialog: Still is. He'll take you under his
dialog: wing at Information Retrieval. You'll
dialog: like it when you get there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're not listening, mother.
dialog: 
text: A warning buzzer goes off as MOTHER's handbag goes thru
text: security check. It turns out to have been activated by a
text: gaily wrapped package. A SECURITY GUARD relieves her of it
text: and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of
dialog: executive toy which we have seen twice before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: It's a present for my son.
dialog: 
text: She takes the toy back and hands it to SAM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I hope you like it. It's very
dialog: exclusive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: It's something for executives.
dialog: 
text: At this point the MAITRE D arrives on the scene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAITRE D
dialog: Madam Lowry, how exquisite to see you
dialog: again. Merry Christmas.
dialog: 
text: He pulls aside he velvet rope with a grand flourish. He
text: looks disdainfully at SAM's unfashionable clerk's suite
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: (blocking Sam's way)
dialog: I'm sorry but ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: You remember Samuel, my son.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: {suddenly unctious)
dialog: Oh, but of course ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are we?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
dialog: 
text: SPIRO leads the way. SAM and his MOTHER follow, across the
text: restaurant which is much like the Palm Court at the Plaza
text: New York. Trellises, marble columns, antique mirroring,
dialog: potted palms combine to impress us with their
dialog: sophistication and taste. A string quartet can just be
text: made out against the far wall. Except for the unfortunate
text: intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting
text: across areas of the ceiling, occasionally penetrating
text: right through the middle of a particularly valuable-
text: looking mirror, the general effect is one of confident
text: wealth and breeding. SAM, MOTHER and MAITRE D make their
text: way across the room. The waltzing strains of the string
text: quartet accompanying them.
dialog: 
text: CUT to group of tables with diners. At one of them sits a
text: wealthy-looking OLDER WOMAN with a rather plain-looking
text: DAUGHTER in her 20s. The OLDER WOMAN is easily
text: distinguished from the other clientele by a large bandage
text: that covers a goodish part of her head. The two of them
text: (the MOTHER and DAUGHTER, not the MOTHER and bandage) are
text: perusing the menus. SAM notes the DAUGHTER, unpleased.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mother, I thought we were going to be
dialog: able to talk .... Oh God, she's got
dialog: what's he name with her.
dialog: 
text: SAM and his MOTHER arrive at the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: Ida! Sam!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Alma, how are you? You're looking
dialog: wonderful! Hello, Shirley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY
dialog: (shy to Sam)
dialog: Salt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: (to Shirley)
dialog: Not yet.
dialog: (to Sam and Mother)
dialog: Happy Christmas, Sam.
dialog: 
text: She hands SAM a gaily wrapped package which obviously
text: contains the same executive toy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Sorry we're late. Shall we order? Get
dialog: it out of the way. What are you going
dialog: to have Alma?
dialog: 
text: She starts to hunt through the huge menu the MAITRE D has
text: just handed her with full colour photos of the splendid
dialog: dishes available.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: I can't make up my mind whether to
dialog: have a number one or a number two.
dialog: What do you recommend, Spiro?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: (conspiratorially)
dialog: Between you and me, Madam, today the
dialog: number two.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are
dialog: you going to have?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY
dialog: (panics quietly)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: (conspiratorially)
dialog: Between you and me, Mademoiselle,
dialog: today the number one. Madam Lowry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Oh, to hell with the diet, a number
dialog: eight, please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I
dialog: may say so.
dialog: (to Sam)
dialog: Monsieur?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (brusquely)
dialog: A steak, please. Rare.
dialog: (to his mother)
dialog: Mother, I need to ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: (piqued)
dialog: Monsieur. Quel numero.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (handing back menu)
dialog: I don't know which numero.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: (writing on pad)
dialog: Numero, trois.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: EVERYONE is a bit embarrassed here. MOTHER gives SAM a
text: withering look. SPIRO stalks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (trying to restart things)
dialog: Alma, you wicked thing ...
dialog: (indicating bandages)
dialog: you've started your treatment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: You noticed.
dialog: (enthusiastically)
dialog: I must tell you all about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (to his mother)
dialog: Mother, will you listen to
dialog: 
text: At this moment the food arrives. SPIRO elaborately lifts
text: off the silver covers and with a flourish distributes the
text: plates of food. Each order looks identical - a big splodge
text: of brown lumpy stuff. The only differences between the
text: lumps are the Identifying photographs on sticks stuck in
text: each. The beautiful colour photos match the photos which
text: were on the menus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: (showing off that he
dialog: remembers who's ordered
dialog: what)
text: Numero huit, braised veal in wine
dialog: sauce.
text: (he sets it in front of
dialog: Sam's Mother)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe
dialog: and gone to Dr. Chapman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: Numero deux, duck a l'orange.
text: (he sets it in front of Mrs
dialog: Terrain)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: The acid man?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: Really, Ida, just because his
dialog: techniques are revolutionary ... I
dialog: don't go around calling Dr Jaffe the
dialog: knife man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: Numero une, crevettes à la
dialog: mayonaaise.
text: (he sets it in front of
dialog: Shirley)
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to
dialog: sound so ...
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: That's all right Ida ... it's just
dialog: that he's such an artist. To him,
dialog: cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: Numero trois, steak.
dialog: (He sets this in front of
dialog: Sam)
dialog: Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
speaker_heading: ALL BUT SAM
dialog: Merci.
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: Acid on the other hand, can be used
dialog: for such wonderfully subtle shading,
dialog: such delicate nuances - just like a
dialog: Rembrant etching ... and it's so much
dialog: quicker. Why, if it weren't for a
dialog: teensy-weensy complication - the
dialog: doctor said it could have happened to
dialog: anyone - I would have had these
text: bandages off yesterday.
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY
dialog: (to Sam, after attracting
text: her mother's attention and
dialog: receiving a nod)
dialog: Salt?
dialog: 
text: They are just about to dip into their respective splodges
text: when there is a terrific explosion - a huge hole is
text: blasted out of the wall to the kitchen. Chaos erupts
text: around the carnage as WAITERS try putting out the flames
text: with extinguishers. PEOPLE, bloody and dying, are moaning.
text: The DINERS not actually affected by the blast look up for
text: a moment and then, with a few raised eyebrows, go back to
dialog: their meals.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EXPLOSION.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: What were we saying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (picking bomb debris out of
dialog: his brown lump)
dialog: This isn't rare!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: By the way, I saw a wonderful idea
dialog: for Christmas presents at the
dialog: chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift
dialog: tokens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: Oh, that sounds marvellous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Yes, they're good at any doctor's and
dialog: at many of the major hospitals - and
dialog: they're accepted for gynecological
dialog: complications including Caesarian
dialog: section.
dialog: 
text: SAM, in the act of taking in another forkful of his
text: unappetising meal, drops his form in disgust
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look - please - I'm sorry - but
dialog: honestly, mother, this is -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER.
dialog: I quite agree! - It's impossible!
dialog: 
text: MOTHER raises her arm to gain the attention of the MAITRE
text: D who is frantically trying to deal with the emergency.
text: The activity in the background has increased throughout
text: the conversation. The fire-brigade has arrived with sirens
text: blaring. Ministry TROOPS have charged in and are arresting
text: WAITERS. Stretchers have been bought in for the injured
text: and these are being rushed past our little GROUP's table.
text: The MAITRE D comes to the table, his DJ now blood-
text: spattered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAITRE D
dialog: I am sorry, Madam ... I don't know
dialog: what to say ... this very rarely
dialog: happens to us - I'll do what I can
dialog: straight away
dialog: 
text: He hurries away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: Really, Sam - when are you going to
dialog: do something about these terrorists?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Actually, Alma, that's one of the
dialog: little things I was dying to tell you
dialog: ... Sam's been promoted to
dialog: Information Retrieval.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (angry and surprised)
dialog: Mother!
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: Oh that's wonderful! Congratulations
dialog: Sam...
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY
dialog: You can show those fucking murderous
dialog: bastards a thing or two.
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: (shocked and embarrassed)
dialog: Shirley!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Stop this!
dialog: (leaping to his feet)
dialog: I'm not being promoted. I'm not going
dialog: to Information Retrieval!
dialog: (he scrumples promotion
dialog: notification which he has
text: been holding and throws it
dialog: on the floor)
dialog: If I want you to stick your oar in,
dialog: mother, I'll tell you where to stick
dialog: it!
dialog: 
text: EVERYBODY is shocked. He recovers his composure slightly.
text: Embarrassed, he bends, and picks up the ball of paper
text: which he starts smoothing back into Its flat state.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY
dialog: (back to her uncertain
dialog: form)
dialog: Pepper...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look - I've got to get back -
dialog: 
text: As SAM goes, MAITRE D reappears with a group of WAITERS -
text: those remaining unarrested - whom he has organised to gut
text: up a folding screen around the table. This cuts of the
text: sight if not the noise of the VICTIMS of the explosion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I
dialog: don't want promotion. I don't want
dialog: anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course
dialog: you want something. You must have
dialog: hopes, wishes, dreams.
dialog: 
text: Their voices have been rising towards a shout in order to
text: rise above the volume of the growing chaos around them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (shouts loud)
text: NO, NOTHING. NOT EVEN DREAMS!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 29 EXT. BRILLIANT SKY				 DAY		 29
dialog: 
text: SAM as his dream-self rises INTO SHOT, his wings straining
text: as he tows the floating cage imprisoning the GIRL. They
text: are rising up and away from the monolithic stone
text: skyscrapers that stretch away below them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm taking you to a safe place. A
dialog: place where they will never be able
dialog: to get at us ... ever.
dialog: 
text: An eyeball is scanning the sky. PULLING BACK we see it is
text: but one of thousands, tightly packed side by side forming
text: a landscape that extends as far as we can see. As SAM and
text: the GIRL in her cage come into view it becomes apparent
dialog: just how big these eyeballs are - they are gigantic -
text: about 10 feet in diameter. All of them follow SAM as he
text: comes to rest on a platform high atop a column that rises
dialog: from the centre of this bizarre place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: There's no way they can approach us
dialog: without being seen. You're safe here.
dialog: 
text: He anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his
text: wings. Just as he starts climbing up to the cage a
text: terrific cracking noise is heard. SAM freezes.
dialog: 
text: A dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere
text: beyond the horizon - running right up the sky and over the
text: camera. SAM follows it as it continues over the GIRL and
text: down to the opposite horizon. Another crackling noise is
text: heard. Another crack appears. Then another. And another.
text: All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over
text: the horizon. Soon the sky is covered with these cracks
text: from horizon to foreground. Then cracks begin appearing at
text: right angles to them. Very quickly the sky is covered with
text: a mammoth grid. Once it is complete, another noise is
text: heard. Something like massive blocks of stone sliding
text: against one another. One of the squares formed by the grid
text: pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out
text: from the back side of the sky. A square hole is left in
text: its place. We can see the sides of the hole as it extends
text: upwards into blackness. As soon as this first block of sky
text: is withdrawn, another begins to slide up and away. SAM is
text: frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on
text: above him. The eyeballs are madly looking this way and
text: that. The grinding noises are deafening as block after
text: block of sky is removed. With each successive loss the
text: light decreases. The GIRL is crying out for SAM to save
text: her. Frantically SAM tries to haul the cage down to the
text: platform but it's too late.
dialog: 
text: Where the sky was is now pitch black. Only one block of
text: sky remains. Slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up and
text: out of shot. Total blackness. A maniacal laughter can be
text: heard. A beam of light is switched on. SAM has a
text: searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness. The
text: laughter continues. Suddenly the beam catches something
text: black and moving. it's the same black, flapping cloth that
text: appeared at the end of the previous dream. The horrible
text: flapping thing comes thundering down on SAM.
dialog: 
text: He is engulfed in the black awfulness.

text: oppressively hot. He gets up and looks at the thermostat.
text: It reads 99. He fumbles with it, but to no avail. It's
dialog: stuck.
dialog: 
text: CUT to SAM coming into the sitting room. He rushes over to
text: the window and tries to open it. But it wasn't designed to
text: be opened. Screws hold it firmly shut. SAM heads to the
text: kitchen He finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the
text: window. He swings the window open and takes a deep breath.
text: GAG! COUGH! HACK! A terrible greeny-brown smog pours in
text: through the window. Desperately SAM shuts the window and
text: madly tightens up the screws. Swinging a newspaper, he
text: tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere. He
text: makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall
text: gasping for air.
text: CUT to telephone being lifted from its cradle. Pull back
text: as SAM with opened telephone directory in front of him
text: dials. He is seated in his kitchen. In front of his open
text: refrigerator. The phone rings at the other end.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello - Central Services - I'm at
scene_heading: 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D
dialog: - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures
text: Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover
dialog: - and I've got trouble with the air-
dialog: conditioning
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: Thank you or calling Central
dialog: Services. am sorry, due to temporary
dialog: staff shortage, Central Services
dialog: cannot take service calls centrally
dialog: between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a
dialog: nice day - this has not been a
dialog: recording, incident-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is an emergency!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: Thank you for calling Central
dialog: Services. I am sorry, due -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes, but. I've got to have a heating
dialog: engineer
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: Thank you for calling Cen -
dialog: 
text: SAM slams the phone down.
dialog: 
text: CUT to SAM sitting in front of the refrigerator. The door
text: is open and he has wedged a chair into the gap in a
text: desperate bid to keep cool. He is nodding off. As his head
text: slumps against one of the shelves, a jar of pickled onions
text: falls to the floor. The onions scattering everywhere.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 31 EXT. DARKNESS					 NIGHT		 31
dialog: 
text: The milky white spheres tumble everywhere. But they are
text: not onions, they are the giant eyeballs burtling through
text: space. SAM is clinging desperately to one. He grabs the
text: pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch
text: cover. SAM manages to pull himself inside. Once out of the
text: intergalactic maelstrom, SAM turns to survey the cramped
text: and dark space inside the eyeball. It seems to be bisected
text: by a dividing wall, from which a thin sliver of light is
text: escaping. Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit, SAM
text: is able to move a section. More light shaftes into the
text: tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a
text: small hatch. SAM scrunches down and really puts his
text: shoulder to the hatch. with a metallic rasp it gives way
text: and SAM crashes through.
dialog: 
text: CUT to other side of opening as SAM topples through. He
text: catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms
text: back revealing his close call with disaster. He is high on
text: a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets. The hatch
text: he came through was the front of one of the millions of
text: files-drawers composing this wall. As he scrambles back
text: into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for
text: hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist. Other
text: walls of files enclose this vast space. From where SAM is
text: it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the Time
text: Life building in NYC. These millions of files are being
text: tended by MEN arising themselves up and down, as well as
text: sideways, on modern skyscraper window-cleaners' platforms.
text: The attendants are seen putting PEOPLE in different period
text: costumes into drawers. SAM's attention is distracted by a
text: sound overhead. Looking up he sees a window washer
text: platform being lowered in his direction. Leaning over the
text: side is a JOLLY GENT, who happens to look like MR HELPMANN
dialog: (as seen on TV).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENT
dialog: Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What? How do you know my name?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENT
dialog: We know everything here. This is the
dialog: Storeroom of Knowledge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (climbing onto the
dialog: platform)
dialog: Then perhaps you can help me. I've
dialog: lost someone who ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENT
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: We know that too. You've come to the
dialog: right place.
dialog: 
text: The platform carries them along the files.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENT
dialog: Oh, yes. We've got everything here.
dialog: Every bit of knowledge, wisdom,
dialog: learning ... every experience, every
text: thought neatly filed away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: What? You mean you've got ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENT
dialog: Well not exactly. But, if you help us
dialog: we'll help you. The Forces Of
dialog: Darkness have won the day ... but,
dialog: tomorrow is another one
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do I have to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENT
dialog: You must save the day.
dialog: 
text: The platform has stopped. The GENT pulls out a drawer. He
text: reaches inside.
dialog: 
text: The GENT pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENT
dialog: This is the Sword Of Truth ... and
dialog: this the Helmet Of Justice.
dialog: 
text: As SAM begins to strap on the weapon the GENT brings out a
dialog: cape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENT
dialog: And this. completes the outfit.
dialog: 
text: He puts the cape around SAM's shoulders and helps him step
text: into the drawer. A moment's hesitation and then SAM outs
text: the helmet on and lies down in the drawer. It fits just
text: like a coffin.. As he lies back the GENT pushes the drawer
dialog: in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GENT
dialog: It won't be pleasant but, trust me.
dialog: 
text: As the drawer is pushed in SAM suffers a sudden bout of
text: claustrophobia. Looking up at the diministing opening he
text: is surprised to see - not the face of the JOLLY GENT - but
text: a terrifying SAMURAI WARRIOR's masked helmet. SAM
text: struggles to prevent the drawer being closed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 32 INT. SAM'S FLAT					NIGHT		 32
dialog: 
text: SAM is grabbing the walls of the fridge. Water from the
text: defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head. He wakes
text: up. Before he can really take in where he is the phone
text: rings. He staggers over to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hello ... hello ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: Hello. Mr Lowry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who's that?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: 
text: A sound at the kitchen door turns SAM's head - and ours -
text: just in time to half see a quick blurred movement, but
text: then a rapid voice in his ear-piece brings his head back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: Put the phone down and your hands up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: What? Who is this?
dialog: 
text: SAM realises that the voice is also in the room behind
text: him. He turns round and sees TUTTLE. TUTTLE is middle-
text: aged, a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes
text: suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night-raid
text: commando. In one hand he holds a gun pointed at SAM. The
text: other hand is holding a telephone receiver which TUTTLE is
text: in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his
text: feet. SAM puts down his phone, and his hands up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: Nice and easy now. Keep your hands
dialog: where I can see them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What is this?
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: Who the hell are you?
dialog: 
text: TUTTLE, keeping the gun on SAM, goes to different doors,
text: leaning backwards into bedroom, bathroom and closet.
dialog: 
text: TUTTLE suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
text: Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At
dialog: your service.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Tuttle! Are you from Central
dialog: Services?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: Ha!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: But ... I called Central Services.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: They're a bit overworked these days.
dialog: Luckily I intercepted your call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: By now, BOTH are pouring with sweat.
text: TUTTLE heads across the room and swiftly begins to undo a
text: wall panel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Wait a minute, what was that business
dialog: with the gun?
dialog: 
text: TUTTLE hands SAM the panel and plunges his arm into the
text: space behind it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: A little precaution, sir. I've had
dialog: traps set for me before now. There
dialog: are people in Central Services who'd
dialog: love to get their hands on Harry
dialog: Tuttle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you saying this is illegal?
dialog: 
text: By now TUTTLE has managed to pull out some sections of
text: flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal
text: behind the removed panel. It is all very complicated and
text: greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where
text: that came from. TUTTLE is amazingly neat and deft as he
text: works. A real pro. As he works he hums a wee tune ... yes
dialog: ... BRAZIL!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: Well, yes ... and no. Officially,
dialog: only Central Service operatives are
dialog: supposed to touch this stuff ...
dialog: Could you hold these.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
text: (he hands Sam a bunch of
dialog: wires that he has detached)
dialog: ... but, with all the new rules and
dialog: regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon
dialog: ... they can't get decent staff any
dialog: more ... so ... they tend to turn a
dialog: blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.
dialog: (he hands Sam a torch)
dialog: ... Mind you, if ever they could
dialog: prove I'd been working on their
dialog: equipment ... well, that's a
dialog: different matter ... up a bit with
dialog: the torch, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to
dialog: work for Central Services?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're
dialog: getting warm -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The pace?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: The paperwork, couldn't stand the
dialog: paperwork.
dialog: (indicating the torch)
dialog: Over to the left please, if you don't
dialog: mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's
dialog: more bits of paper in Central
dialog: Services than bits of pipe - read
dialog: this, fill in that, hand in the other
dialog: - listen, this old system of yours
dialog: could be on fire and I couldn't even
text: turn on the kitchen tap without
dialog: filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody
dialog: paperwork.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (mildly)
dialog: Well I suppose one has to expect a
dialog: certain amount
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: Why? I came into this game for
dialog: adventure - go anywhere, travel
dialog: light, get in, get out, wherever
dialog: there's trouble, a man alone. Now
dialog: they've got the whole country
dialog: sectioned of and you can't move
dialog: without a form. I'm the last of a
dialog: breed. Ah ha! Found it!
text: (he holds up a small
dialog: charred gadget)
dialog: There's your problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Can you fix it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: No. But I can bypass it with one of
dialog: these
dialog: 
text: He pulls another gadget from his bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fine.
dialog: 
text: The door bell. TUTTLE grabs for his gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: Are you expecting anyone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. Wait here.
dialog: 
text: He goes out closing the immediate door and goes to the
text: front door which he opens. He is confronted by two
text: officious little men in boiler suits who are standing
text: outside his door. Their names are SPOOR and DOWSER. DOWSER
text: is SPOOR's echo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: Central Services.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: ...ervices.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Uh - what? - I ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: You telephone, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: ...elephoned sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: Trouble with your air-conditioning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: ...ditioning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (gulps)
dialog: No, not at all. I mean, it's all
dialog: right. It's fixed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: Fixed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: Fixed?
dialog: 
dialog: They don't like that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I mean it fixed itself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
text: Fixed itself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: ...ixed itself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: Machines don't fix themselves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: ... fix themselves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: He's tampered with it, Dowser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: ...ampered. with it, Spoor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look, I'm sorry about your wasted
dialog: journey
dialog: 
text: SAM tries to close the door but SPOOR prevents this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: (to Dowser)
dialog: I think we'd better have a look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: ... have a look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No you can't.
dialog: 
text: He is pushed aside. SPOOR followed by DOWSER, heads for
text: the door behind which is MR TUTTLE. SAM is paralysed.
text: SPOOR approaches the door as if it is dangerous. He turns
text: the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge. The
text: door begins to swing slowly open. SAM suddenly finds
dialog: inspiration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Just a minute!
dialog: 
text: SPOOR and DOWSER turn round as the door continues to swing
text: open. When the door is open, behind their backs TUTTLE is
text: seen holding his pistol in a two-handed grip, his knees
text: slightly bent. TUTTLE freezes like that, pointing his
text: pistol through the open door.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Have you got a 27B/6?
dialog: 
text: DOWSER looks very angry. Veins stand out on his forehead
text: and he goes into what looks like some sort of fit. SPOOR
text: knocks him to the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: (to Sam)
dialog: Now look what you've done to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Have you got one or haven't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: Not ... as such ...
dialog: 
text: DOWSER moans and begins to get back on his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: But we can get one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: (worried about Dowser)
dialog: It's all right, Terry, it's all
dialog: right, everything's all right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (ushering them to the door)
dialog: I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a
dialog: stickler for paper work. Where would
dialog: we be if we didn't follow the correct
dialog: procedures?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: We'll be back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: ...Be back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Closing the door on them)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: SAM turns back to TUTTLE who is coming forward pocketing
text: his gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: Thanks, Lowry, you're a good man in a
dialog: tight corner.
text: TUTTLE returns to work, fitting in the new by-pass gadget
text: and tightening the nuts, and happily humming "BRAZIL".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Listen .. um ... I don't want to get
dialog: involved in any of this. But I work
dialog: at the Ministry of Information, and I
dialog: happen to know that Information
dialog: Retrieval have been looking for an
dialog: Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer.
dialog: You wouldn't by any chance be -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: My friends call me Harry. Information
dialog: Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do they want you or?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: Time to go.
dialog: 
text: TUTTLE finishes the job and throws his tools into the bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thank you very much. How much will
dialog: it...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: On the house. You did me a favor.
dialog: Check the corridor.
dialog: 
text: SAM goes to the front door, opens it and looks out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
text: All clear.
dialog: 
text: TUTTLE slips out and heads off down the balcony corridor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey that's a dead end.
dialog: 
text: But TUTTLE merely undoes a pre-arranged rope and swings
text: Tarzan-like off the end of the balcony and across a multi-
text: story void to a neighboring block. SAM is amazed - not to
dialog: say - stunned.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 33 INT. RECORDS POOL				 DAY		 33
dialog: 
text: SAM is at his desk among all the desks. Documents are
text: being delivered right, left and centre through the vacuum
text: tubes. All the CLERKS are busy. The screens are devoted to
dialog: their proper use. All this activity is explained by the
text: fact the MR KURTZMAN's door is wide open. At the next desk
text: is another CLERK much like SAM, his NEIGHBOUR.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOUR
dialog: I think Kurtzman getting is
dialog: suspicious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What have we got on today?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOUR
dialog: Casablanca.
dialog: 
text: KURTZMAN appears in his doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Mr Lowry! Would you step in here a
dialog: moment please.
dialog: 
text: We go with KURTZMAN as he closes the office door behind
dialog: him, we are now in ...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 34 INT. KURTZMAN'S OFFICE			 DAY		 34
dialog: 
text: KURTZMAN is pacing anxiously. SAM walks into the office.
text: During the brief opening and closing of the door we just
text: manage to hear the piano player in "Casablanca" singing,
text: "... a kiss is just a kiss ...". KURTZMAN is too worried
text: to notice. He is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if
text: it were contagious. He waves it frantically as SAM enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: (hysterically)
dialog: Thank God you're here! We're in
dialog: terrible trouble! Look at this! Look
dialog: at this!
dialog: 
text: He thrusts the piece of paper at Sam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (taking the paper)
dialog: A cheque.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: The refund for Tuttle!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Tuttle?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion
dialog: from the word go! He's been wrongly
dialog: charged for Electromemorytherapy and
text: someone somewhere is trying to make
dialog: us carry the can!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I've never seen a Ministry cheque
dialog: before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: We've got to get rid of it! There's
dialog: been a balls-up somewhere, and when
text: the music stops they'll jump on
dialog: whoever's holding the cheque!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Send it to somebody else. Send it to
dialog: Buttle. It's his cheque.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: I've tried that! Population Census
dialog: have got him down as dormanted, the
dialog: Central Collective Storehouse
dialog: computer has got him down as deleted,
dialog: and the Information Retrieval have
dialog: got him down as inoperative ...
dialog: Security has him down as excised.,
dialog: Admin have him down as completed
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hang on.
dialog: 
text: SAM sits down at the console and punches keys. He does
text: this very efficiently, muttering to himself and generally
text: demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves KURTZMAN
dialog: way out of his depth, until -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
text: He is dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll
dialog: never get rid of the damned thing!
dialog: What are we going to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Try next of kin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: (a revelation)
dialog: Next of kin!
dialog: 
text: SAM punches more keys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle.
dialog: What's the number on the cheque?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: (reading it)
scene_heading: 27156789/074328/K.
dialog: 
text: SAM has been efficiently punching this in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Into memory. Now ... Central Banking
dialog: ... Buttle, Veronica ... Deposit
dialog: 
text: SAM rips off a print out, rapidly stuffs it and the cheque
text: into a cannister and then into a vacuum tube. A job well
dialog: done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: (fervently)
dialog: Please don't come back! Please don't
dialog: come back!
dialog: 
text: Unfortunately KURTZMAN's prayers are not answered and the.
text: vacuum tube returns almost immediately. SAM opens it up.
dialog: From the computer screen comes a voice "Play it again,
text: Sam" - SAM and KURTZMAN look at the screen. We get a quick
text: glimpse of Humphrey Bogart before the screen reverts to
dialog: numbers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Problem. She doesn't have a bank
dialog: account.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: (hysterically)
dialog: Well, that's it! I may as well go and
dialog: hang myself! This sort of thing
dialog: couldn't have happened before the
dialog: stupid seventh tier reorganization!
dialog: That was Simmons doing! And he and
dialog: Jeffries always sit together at
dialog: lunch! The bastards!
text: (he thumps his hand hard on
dialog: the desk top)
dialog: Ow!
text: (He picks up the offending
dialog: cheque)
dialog: Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the
dialog: filing cabinet ... or destroy it ...
dialog: burn it ... eat it ...
dialog: 
text: Under this tirade SAM has begun to hum "BRAZIL" - not
dialog: entirely sure what inspired him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You'd never get away with it.
dialog: Besides, you can't do that to
dialog: somebody's refund. It's Christmas.
dialog: There is one more option.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: (depressed. Not really
dialog: believing it)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the
dialog: cheque, tell her to sign her name on
text: the back, cash it at the corner sweet
dialog: shop.
dialog: 
text: KURTZMAN is dumbfounded by the audacity of this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: That's brilliant!
dialog: 
text: SAM takes over. In no time at all he has battered away at
text: the keyboard, slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and
text: received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf
dialog: of different coloured papers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'll do it for you. Authorise the
dialog: cheque. What's the address?
dialog: 
text: KURTZMAN scribbles it down for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Here. What do I do next?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Call the motor pool and authorise
dialog: personal transport.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Of course, of course. Leave it to me.
dialog: How do I authorize a cheque?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (separating the and blue
dialog: sheets)
text: Here we are. Pink and blue receipts.
dialog: All you've got to do is sign these
text: and the back of the cheque.
dialog: 
text: KURTZMAN takes out his pen and tries to sign the papers
text: but his hand is giving him trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: (exhausted after all the
dialog: emotion)
dialog: Oh God! I think I've broken a bone.
dialog: What a pathetic thing I am.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (taking the pen from him)
dialog: Here.
text: SAM signs the cheque and receipts. A big CLOSE UP shows
text: that he is scribbling KURTZMAN's signature. SAM pockets
text: the papers and the pen.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: You are good to me Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM

scene_heading: 37 EXT. BUTTLE FLATS				 DAY		 37
dialog: 
text: Beautiful utopian block of high-rise flats gleam in the
text: sunlight. Pulling back we reveal it to be an architect's
text: model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre
text: of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work -
text: graffiti and junk are now the only decorations. In the
text: background is the grim reality of the massive housing
text: tower. SAM's Messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow
text: of the building which is grey, decrepid, vandalised. Huge
text: conduits, pipes, and tubing frame the scene. SAM gets out
text: of the car under the cool and none-too-friendly gaze of a
text: few LOCALS. Self-consciously, SAM looks around him, then
text: at the paper in his hand. A little group of KIDS sit
text: pitching pennies against a wall. SAM goes over to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (super polite)
dialog: Excuse me. Can you tell me ...
dialog: 
text: But before he can finish, the smallest, tiny KID looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Eff off.
dialog: 
text: SAM, uncomfortably, effs off.
dialog: 
text: He is watched, at some distance, imapassively by the
text: little GIRL BUTTTLE. As SAM enters the buildings one of
text: the kids gets out a can of something and approaches the
text: car. Another is fiddling, with a box of matches.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 38 INT. BUTTLE FLATS				 DAY		 38
dialog: 
text: CUT to SAM hesitantly walking into the semi-derelict lobby
text: of the big block of flats. Graffiti, vandalism are in
text: evidence everywhere. He walks up to the lift. Pushes the
text: button. Nothing happens. He pushes again. This time the
text: lift door shudders and sparks. SAM tries to pull the doors
text: apart. They jam open with a three-inch gap between them -
text: still shuddering and grinding. In the sparking light, SAM
text: can make out an interior crammed with garbage, junk, old
text: furniture, dead cats. Yechhhh. Resignedly, he turns
text: towards the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 39 INT. CORRIDOR					 DAY		 39
text: CUT to SAM coming breathlessly out of the stairwell. On
text: the wall next to it is the number 37. Walking down the
text: corridor he looks at the number and starts to knock, but
text: then notices that the door is cracked open. SAM tries to
text: knock on the door, but it keeps edging open and he settles
text: for knocking on the door frame a bit feebly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mrs Buttle
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Uh, Mrs Buttle?
dialog: (silence)
dialog: 
text: SAM stands not knowing what to do.
text: SAM pushes the door a bit more open gingerly and puts
text: about 65 per cent of his body into the hall of the flat.
text: CUT to SAM's POV of darkish hall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mrs Buttle ...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 40 INT. BUTTLE SITTING ROOM			DAY		 40
dialog: 
text: CUT to SAM entering extremely tacky sitting-room shrouded
text: in half-darkness. This is the same flat from which the
text: FATHER was taken at the beginning of the film: the hole is
text: still in the ceiling. SAM becomes aware of a woman sitting
text: absolutely still at a small table by the only (still
text: broken) window in the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you Mrs Buttle?
dialog: 
text: The WOMAN nods very slightly without looking at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: My name is Lowry - Sam Lowry. I'm
dialog: from the Ministry of Information.
dialog: (no response)
dialog: I've come to give you a cheque.
dialog: 
text: SAM takes the cheque out of his pocket and puts it on the
text: table to tempt MRS BUTTLE into a flicker of interest but
text: she fails to notice it - or him for that matter. SAM
text: pushes the cheque a little way towards MRS BUTTLE but she
text: does not respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (indicting cheque)
dialog: It's a refund ... I'm afraid there
dialog: was a mistake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS BUTTLE
dialog: Mistake?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (encouraged)
dialog: Yes. Not my department ... I'm only
dialog: records. It seems that Mr Buttle was
dialog: overcharged by Information Retrieval.
dialog: I don't think they usually make
dialog: mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose
dialog: we're all human.
dialog: 
text: SAM looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling.
dialog: 
dialog: Oh ... what happened to the ...?
dialog: 
text: He gets nothing back.
dialog: 
dialog: Actually, my bringing this here is
dialog: rather unorthodox ... Usually any
dialog: payments are made through the central
dialog: computer ... but, er ... there were
dialog: certain difficulties, and rather than
dialog: cause delay, we thought you might
dialog: appreciate this now ... it being
dialog: Christmas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS BUTTLE
dialog: My husband's dead, isn't he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the
dialog: Ministry is always very scrupulous
dialog: about following up and eradicating
dialog: error. If you have any complaints
dialog: which you'd like to make, I'd be more
dialog: than happy to send you the
dialog: appropriate forms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS BUTTLE
dialog: What have you done with his body?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Um ...
dialog: 
text: MRS BUTTLE starts to cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
dialog: I don't know anything about it ...
dialog: I'm really just delivering the
dialog: cheque. Er ... If you wouldn't mind
dialog: signing these receipts
dialog: (producing blue and pink
dialog: receipts)
dialog: I'll go and leave you in peace.
dialog: 
text: SAM picks up the cheque and gives it to MRS BUTTLE
text: together with the receipts. MRS BUTTLE tears them up and
text: throws them in his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Uh ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS BUTTLE
dialog: He hadn't done anything ... He was
dialog: good ... What have you done with his
dialog: body?
dialog: 
text: SAM looks around for an escape and sees a YOUNG BUTTLE
text: standing in the doorway. The BOY is looking at him with a
text: blank tearful face. Suddenly the BOY launches himself at
text: SAM with terrible ferocity. SAM is knocked against the
text: wall. A mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the
text: floor. The BOY is all over SAM kicking and pulling his
text: hair. MRS BUTTLE's reaction, however, is to try and pull
text: the BOY away from SAM. By the time she succeeds, SAM is on
text: his hands and knees, in pain. The BOY is crying and
text: shouting, and MRS BUTTLE is loudly trying to quieten the
speaker_heading: BOY.
dialog: 
text: From SAM'S POV, a piece of broken mirror lying on the
text: floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with JILL's
text: head and shoulders framed in the hole. The moment is
text: unreal for SAM in his dazed condition. The vision seems
text: unreal too. JILL is staring at SAM out of the piece of
text: mirror and. she's very much the GIRL from his dream now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Are you alright?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (mumbles)
dialog: It's you ... it's you ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
dialog: 
text: SAM grabs at the image, i.e. at the mirror, shifting the
text: angle so that the vision disappears. He looks for the
text: vision on the floor but can't find it. Then he begins to
text: realise the reality of what he has seen. He stands up,
text: dazed and battered. MRS BUTTLE has been looking up at the
text: ceiling. SAM looks up at the ceiling but there is now only
text: the empty space of the hole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Wait! Stop! Come back!!
dialog: 
text: MRS BUTTLE is shouting. SAM rushes out of the flat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 41 INT. BUTTLE'S CORRIDOR			 DAY		 41
dialog: 
text: SAM looks both ways and heads for the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 42 INT. BUTTLE'S STAIRCASE			 DAY		 42
dialog: 
text: SAM runs up the stairs to the floor above and finds
dialog: himself in -
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 43 EXT. SIMILAR CORRIDOR			 DAY		 43
dialog: 
text: He runs along the corridor but has omitted to count the
text: doors downstairs and now doesn't know which door to knock
text: at. He hesitates. He rings the bell on what he hopes is
text: the right door. The bell doesn't work. He bangs on the
text: door. The door opens a crack. A malevolent eye looks at
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Girl ... fair hair ...
dialog: 
text: The door shuts firmly. SAM rushes to the next door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 44 INT. JILL'S FLAT				 DAY		 44
dialog: 
text: SAM bursts into JILL's flat. He sees the hole in the
text: floor. The place looks derelict. He hears an explosion and
text: looks out of a window to see his car in flames. JILL is
text: apparently retreating from it across the forecourt. She is
text: carrying a suitcase and bundles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 45 INT. STAIRCASE					DAY		 45
dialog: 
text: SAM rushes down the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 46 EXT. BLOCK OF FLATS				DAY		 46
dialog: 
text: SAM charges out into the open air. JILL has disappeared.
text: The Messerchmidt, however, is in flames. SAM doesn't know
text: which way to turn. Spotting an old mattress lying by the
text: building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an
text: attempt to smother the flames. The group of CHILDREN watch
text: him silently. Suddenly with a great roar, JILL's lorry
text: comes round the corner at speed. SAM sees that JILL is at
text: the wheel. SAM runs after the lorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Wait! It was nothing to do with me!
dialog: 
text: The lorry roars away. SAM dashes back to his smoldering
text: three-wheeler. He flings himself into it and starts it up.
text: He also roars away, except that he doesn't move... all
text: three wheels have been removed. He turns round in despair
text: and sees the group of CHILDREN regarding him
text: expressionlessly.
dialog: 
text: They include the little GIRL BUTTLE.
dialog: 
text: Defeated, he slumps down against his charred vehicle. A
text: shadow passes across his face. Looking up he sees GIRL
text: BUTTLE standing over him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Go away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL BUTTLE
dialog: Her name is Jill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL BUTTLE
dialog: Layton.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Jill Layton ...
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: You're a very good little girl. What
dialog: are you doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL BUTTLE
dialog: I'm waiting for my daddy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (uncomprehending)
dialog: He will be pleased when he comes
dialog: home.
dialog: 
text: GIRL BUTTLE doesn't answer and SAM starts to walk away.
text: After a few yards, the thought strikes him: he turns back
text: to look at the little GIRL BUTTLE who stands alone
text: patiently in the vandalised wilderness.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 47 INT. RECORD CLERKS POOL			 DAY		 47
dialog: 
text: It is the end of the work day. The CLERKS are busily
text: getting their coats and leaving the office. As the last
text: one goes MR. KURTZMAN comes out of his private office with
text: his hat and coat on. He turns out the office light. He
text: sees SAM isolated in the empty room, still working at his
text: computer console. Totally absorbed in what he is doing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Oh ... Sam. I've had the transport
dialog: pool onto me ... You don't know
dialog: anything about a personnel
dialog: transporter gone missing do you?
dialog: 
text: SAM doesn't seem to hear him. On the computer screen is a
text: front and side view picture of JILL. Her name and code
text: number is at the top of the screen. SAM is punching up
dialog: personal dossier information like "age", "height",
dialog: "weight", "colour of hair", "colour of eyes",
dialog: "distinguishing marks" etc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (preoccupied)
dialog: A "personnel" transporter? They've
dialog: got it wrong. I had a personal
dialog: transporter. I'll do the paperwork
dialog: tomorrow -
dialog: 
text: SAM punches up a few more categories for JILL's dossier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's
dialog: cheque?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I delivered it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Can I forget it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: SAM punches a few more buttons on the computer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: What a relief!
dialog: (on reflection)
dialog: I shall probably have nightmares.
dialog: 
text: At this point the word "Classified" superimposes itself
text: over most of the screen and "IRQ/3" starts agitating at
dialog: the bottom
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Damn! Blast!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: What's the matter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You don't happen to know how I can
dialog: get around an IRQ/3 do you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: All information on 3rd Level Suspects
dialog: is classified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: All enquiries to Information
dialog: Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of
dialog: course. They never tell you anything.
dialog: But come the time they want something
dialog: from us ...
dialog: 
text: Throughout this verbal wallpaper SAM has been punching
text: keys cancelling the CLASSIFIED overprint. He then punches
text: in the code for a hard-copy print-out. JILL's two-view
text: computer portrait rolls out as SAM ponders his options.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (cutting off Kurtzman)
dialog: I've go to accept that promotion to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (realising what he's
dialog: suggesting)
dialog: NO! You can't! You've only just
dialog: turned it down!
dialog: (thinking Sam is joking)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I never signed the form.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: I did it for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What! Shit!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: It's what you wanted isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
dialog: 
text: KURTZMAN picks up JILL's print-out and glances at it. He
text: grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KURTZMAN
dialog: Come on, before they turn the lights
dialog: out.
dialog: 
text: SAM nods. He turns off the machine. He stands up and
text: follows KURTZMAN towards the door. The door is some
text: distance away, and before they get there all the lights go
text: out. KURTZMAN bumps into a desk and curses.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 48 INT. TRANSPORT CAGE				EVENING		48
dialog: 
text: Packed tightly between other passengers SAM is busy
text: drawing long flowing hair with a pencil on the computer
text: print-out of JILL turning her into the DREAM GIRL. The
text: transport cage rattles through its elevated tube towards a
dialog: tower block.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 49 INT. SAM'S CORRIDOR				EVENING		49
dialog: 
text: The transport cage arrives at the platform forming the end
text: of SAM's corridor. Passengers disembark and head for
text: various doors along the corridor. SAM almost fails to get
text: off in time - so concentrated on JILL's picture is he.
text: Looking as if he's trying to make up his mind about
text: something he heads for his own front door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 50 INT. SAM'S FLAT					EVENING		50
dialog: 
text: SAM enters. The place is in a state of turmoil. Servicing
text: panels are off the walls. Conduit, ducting, pipes, unknown
text: mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was
text: disemboweled. SPOOR stands in the middle of it all trying
text: to direct two other WORKMEN who are poring over wiring
text: plans which seem to make little sense to them. DOWSER is
text: not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and
text: banging going on somewhere behind the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What the - ? How did you - ?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: Emergency procedures.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER (O.S.)
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: ...ergency procedures.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: I haven't got an emergency. Get out
dialog: of here.
dialog: 
text: For reply SPOOR whips a small tape-recorder out of his bag
text: and plays back SAM's original phone call to Central
text: Services, claiming "an emergency". SPOOR shuts off his
text: machine, puts back into his bag and comes out with what
text: looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper
text: between each page. SPOOR indicates the bottom of page 1.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: Sign here please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: It's a 27B/6, what did you think it
dialog: was?
dialog: 
text: SAM takes out KURTZMAN's old-fashioned fountain pen from
text: his pocket, signs where indicated. SPOOR registers that
text: SAM's signature has hardly penetrated through he first
dialog: carbon let alone the other 43
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: (sourly)
dialog: Haven't you got a ballpoint?
dialog: 
text: SAM resignedly starts signing all the other pages one by
text: one. SPOOR realises that DOWSER's echo has gone missing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: Now where's he got to?
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Dowser!
dialog: 
text: DOWSER bursts through a panel in the wall. This is the
text: panel which TUTTLE had removed and replaced. A few of the
text: flat's intestines have come out with DOWSER. DOWSER has
text: made a find - TUTTLE's spare part.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: What have you got there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: (highly excited)
dialog: Got there!
dialog: 
text: DOWSER points to TUTTLE's spare part which is hanging out
text: of the wall attached to rubber tube. SPOOR examines this
text: closely. SAM watches alarmed. The TWO MEN go into a
text: mumbling huddle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ...
dialog: Tuttle
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: Mumble ... Tuttle ...

speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: ...sabotage!
dialog: 
text: SPOOR and DOWSER and the other workmen gather up their
dialog: tools - put them in the bag, grab everything else that
text: belongs to them and are leaving. SPOOR grabs the form-book
text: out of SAM's hands, rips out the last page, thrusts that
text: page at SAM, shoves the book into his bag. The WORKMEN
text: begin leaving the flat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't
dialog: just go and leave it like this!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPOOR
dialog: (mock innocent)

speaker_heading: DOWSER

dialog: You're putting your talents to very

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWSER
dialog: ...sod you, stupid twit.
dialog: 
text: They go, slamming the door behind hem, leaving SAM in the
text: ruins of his flat.
dialog: 
text: SAM stands in the maimed sitting-room. Wall panels are
text: off. Tubes, ducting wires etc. spill out into the room
text: like greasy intestines. SAM more or less collapses onto a
text: couch. He stares at the ceiling. The room is gently
text: hiccoughing and belching around him. He stares at the
text: print-out of JILL's face. Slowly it dissolves into the
scene_heading: DREAM GIRL.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 51 EXT. CONDUIT FOREST				NIGHT		 51
dialog: 
text: DREAM GIRL's face fills screen. The camera pulls back to
text: reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest
text: of conduit/ducting-like vines. SAM is struggling through
text: the vines, which grab at him, entwine and entangle him.
text: Finally bursting free he reaches out for the GIRL hovering
text: before him, But as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke
text: and he plummet into a void beneath his feet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 52 EXT. CLOUDS					 NIGHT		 52
dialog: 
text: CUT to SAM plummeting down through dense clouds, his cape
text: twisting around him. Somehow he manages to wrestle it
text: clear of his body. Gripping the corners he whips the cape
text: up and over his head. The wind catches it and fills it out
text: until it acts as a parachute slowing SAM's descent.
text: Suddenly the clouds thin out and SAM can see below him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 53 EXT. STRANGE LANDSCAPE			 ANTI-DAY	 53
dialog: 
text: SAM is heading down towards a barren landscape. Strange
text: mounds dot the barrenness - they ooze smoke and the
text: occasional flame. Near one of the mounds are two long
text: lines of shrouded FIGURES being forced into two giant
text: cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons. The
text: black-robed FORCES OF DARKNESS (FOD) surround the
text: PRISONERS, relentlessly herding them towards the cages.
text: The entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light.
text: The sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a
text: black disc. SAM descends on his cape-parachute.
dialog: 
text: CUT to PRISONERS in their grey shrouds, shuffling towards
text: the jaws of the brutal cages. They are defeated,
text: destroyed, without hope. The FOD prod and whip them
text: forward. One of the FOD raises his spear to force a
text: stumbling PRISONER to his feet but stops with the spear
text: raised above his head. He has seen something. Other FODS
text: turn to see what it is. CUT to SAM landing on the beach -
text: a short distance away. The PRISONERS stop and look up. We
text: see their faces clearly for the first time. One of them is
text: MRS BUTTLE. Others are PEOPLE SAM saw in the flats, and
text: the KIDS. SAM recognises them. He is slightly taken aback.
text: A look of determination crosses his face. He draws the
text: sword. EVERYONE is frozen in place. SAM starts forward.
text: But he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins
text: to tremble and shake. EVERYONE looks terrified. With a
text: mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between SAM and
text: the OTHERS. Brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from the
text: opening. And then, with a maniacal shriek, the large black
text: flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks high
text: into the sky. SAM hesitates and turns to look down into
text: the light. There, under several meters of the earth's
text: crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautiful
text: blue sky. SAM is delighted but as he looks up he is frozen
text: in his tracks by an enormous FIGURE that straddles the
text: crevasse. This terrifying CREATURE stands over 12 feet
text: high. He is encased in a frightening concoction of ancient
text: Japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he
text: made of computer parts. His face is hidden behind a
text: horrific steel mask. It is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR that
text: was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom Of
text: Knowledge. In his hand is an evil-looking spear. SAM is
text: unsure which way to turn. The GREY PRISONERS are being
text: loaded into the cages with more speed. He turns to face
text: the GIANT WARRIOR. As SAM steps forward the GIANT stands
text: ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in
text: an almost religious gesture. POOF! He vanishes. As he does
text: the light from the day is cut off. Looking down, SAM sees
text: that he crevasse has vanished as well. Maniacal laughter
text: from the flapping black thing makes SAM look up to see the
text: ballooned cage packed with GREY PRISONERS rise up from the
text: ground and begin to float away escorted by the Black
text: flapping Thing. SAM rushes after it grabbing one of the
text: trailing ropes. But as he is hoisted into the air it is
text: severed by the FODS. He tumbles to the ground. Looking
text: around he sees that, for some reason, the second ballooned
text: cage is still tethered nearby. SAM rushes over to it and
text: begins chopping the tethers away.
text: The cage bobbles ungainlily as SAM cuts the last
text: restraining rope. Grabbing hold he is pulled upwards, but
text: before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg
text: halting his progress. As he struggles his other leg is
text: caught. He is being pulled back by two giant hands.
text: Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the
text: smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude. The
text: face looks like MR KURTZMAN. SAM desperately clings on to
text: the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR KURTZMAN OF THE MOUND
dialog: Don't go! It's a trap! She's not what

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: GIRL

text: wearing. an unstylish tuxedo and bow tie - obviously his

text: who's about to speak when an attractive 40-year old
text: woman's face appears over his shoulder and addresses SAM

speaker_heading: WOMAN

dialog: 
text: SAM steps inside, where the flunky proceeds to search him.
text: The place is full of sleek people - smartly but less
text: formally dresses than SAM. It is an elegant baroque room -
text: lavishly appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous
text: Central Service ducts that thrust through antique
text: tapestries and gilt mirrors with little regard for
text: aesthetics or the interior decorator's feelings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: Mother? Is that you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
text: (taking his arm - looking

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is Mr Helpmann here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.

speaker_heading: DR JAFFE
dialog: (a trifle haughtily)
dialog: Excuse me, Dr Chapman, did you say
dialog: something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR CHAPMAN
dialog: That technique ... I've tried it. A
dialog: nice effect. But highly unstable. In
dialog: six months she'll look like Grandma

dialog: 
text: SAM wishing to escape from this bitchery turns away but
text: suddenly freezes - the reflection in the large wall mirror
text: next to him is not that of the party guests - but of the
text: GREY PRISONERS in his dream - they are massed in the room
text: looking pleadingly towards him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR JAFFE

speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: Whatever happened to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN

speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: Here we are! I'm going to leave you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I ... uh ...
dialog: 
text: But he is alone with SHIRLEY, standing at the entrance to
text: his MOTHER's embarrassingly rampant boudoir style bedroom.
text: In amongst the diaphanous curtains enclosing the bed
text: MOTHER is playing hide and seek with a YOUNG STUD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Can I get you a drink, Shirley?
dialog: 
text: SHIRLEY looks at him terrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look ... Shirley ... your mother ...

speaker_heading: JACK

text: SAM steps out of the lift.The lift doors close. SAM looks
text: up and down the corridor hearing nothing. Silence. Then
text: he, and we, begin to hear a sound. It is a curious
text: whirring murmuring tummeling sound, and it seems to be
text: growing closer. Suddenly a scrum of PEOPLE swings into
text: view around a corner at the far end of the rather long
text: corridor. At the centre of the scrum is a TALL MAN with a
text: magisterial expression and an air of eternal bustle. This
text: is MR WARREN. He is surrounded by the EXPEDITERS who are
text: competing for his attention with bits of paper and bits of
text: sentences. MR WARREN is snapping out decisions. Satisfied
text: EXPEDITERS drop out of the scrum at intervals,
text: disappearing one at a time through one of the many doors
text: which line both sides of the corridor.The scrum doesn't
text: get any smaller because new EXPEDITERS dart out of other
text: doors and join the milling MOB. The whole circus is coming

dialog: 
text: SAM doesn't have the nerve to jump into this. The scrum

text: disappearing around the corner at the other end. SAM
text: follows. Silence has descended again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 61 INT. CORRIDOR					 DAY		 61
dialog: 
text: SAM gets to the corner of the corridor and finds a similar
text: corridor at right angles. He hesitates and continues. Then
text: he starts to hear the sound again. It is coming up from
text: behind. MR WARREN has circumnavigated the building. The

dialog: 
text: CUT to SAM's POV of the office. It is about four feet
text: wide. A small blacked-out window high on the far wall is

scene_heading: 62 INT. SAM'S OFFICE				 DAY		 62
dialog: 
text: SAM looks lost ... disoriented. He doesn't know where to
text: begin because there's nothing to begin with. He squeezes
dialog: in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do
text: starts arranging his "in" and "out" baskets. There in his
dialog: "in" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys -
text: gaily wrapped with a card from HELPMANN - Merry Xmas &
text: Welcome. SAM can't quite believe. He returns to lining up
text: his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books)
text: against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. SAM
text: turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they
text: both fall over with a "plop". Puzzled, he stands the books
text: up again, turns his eyes away and "plop". Same result.
text: Intrigued, a bit exasperated, SAM carefully, and before
text: his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall,
text: and "plop", the books topple over. Puzzled, SAM grabs hold
text: of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the
text: wall. The desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops,
text: somehow held stubbornly. SAM grits his teeth, reallllly
text: pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge.

text: The other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking,
text: round-headed little JUNIOR EXECUTIVE wholly occupied with
text: trying to drag a bit more of the desk into his office. He

speaker_heading: LIME

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: LIME
dialog: (leering)
dialog: A woman eh? I see.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (trying to ignore this)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIME

dialog: You must be joking -
dialog: (entirely unconvincing)
dialog: When there's a woman involved -
dialog: there's no stopping me. Now, let me
dialog: have that sheet.
dialog: 
text: He takes Jill's print-out sheet from SAM and begins to
text: punch the keys laboriously with one finger. Nothing

dialog: 
text: The CAMERA skims along over an icy sea. This is SAM'S POV
text: as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming
text: wings. In the distance rises a strange massive ship.
dialog: 
text: As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing
text: heavily to one side. In fact it is barely afloat. Closer
text: still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone.
text: Dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull,
text: but the super-structures and smokestacks. It looks like a
text: massive medieval fortress gone to sea. The screen is
text: engulfed in stone. The CAMERA heads up the side of the
text: ship. Higher and higher we climb - past course after
text: course of mammoth stones. Reaching the first deck, we
text: continue upwards. There appears to be no entrance. SAM is
text: looking frustrated and angry. But then he spots an
text: opening. A few stones have come loose - one of them juts
text: out forming a ledge. As the cage passes, SAM jumps and
text: managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping. Squeezing
text: thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark
text: passage. Emerging from the opening he finds himself
text: teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull
text: and the inner stone core of the ship. Great stone ribs
text: curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow
text: shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks
text: and fissures in the stone core. For a brief moment SAM
text: gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but
text: his attention is distracted by a distant moan. Huddled far
text: below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of
text: grey shrouded PRISONERS. Their moan blends with the creaks
text: and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back
text: and forth. Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the
text: ship. SAM is unsure where it comes from. And then another
text: boom reverberates about him. He has to steady himself as
text: the ship quivers from the noise. Another book. He clutches
text: at the wall.

dialog: 
text: SAM's head is leaning against the wall of his office. The

text: leaps up. As he leaves his office he looks back to see the
text: desk creep through to LIME's office a little bit more.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 67 INT. LIME'S OFFICE				 DAY		 67

text: He stops, having come to the end. He looks at the other

dialog: 
dialog: Is this all you got?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIME
dialog: It's a start isn't it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (disbelieving)
dialog: But I already knew this!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIME
dialog: Best to take it slowly where some
dialog: women are concerned.
dialog:

speaker_heading: LIME
dialog: Hey - that's my desk!

speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173.

speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Ah, Lowry, glad I caught you ...
dialog: (he continues to deal with

dialog: No, send it back for ... Are you
dialog: settling down? ... I want this order
dialog: rescinded ... There's a query on a
dialog: personnel transporter you took out
dialog: from the pool ... Tell them no, tell
dialog: them yes, ... or was it a personnel
dialog: carrier you took out from

dialog: Security ... Some kind of eight-wheel-
dialog: half-track, was it? ... Tell him I
dialog: want to see him ... Send round the
dialog: paperwork, Lowry ... Arrange a
dialog: conference on that one ... Anyway,
dialog: tidy it up, Lowry, there's a good
dialog: chap - get a new suit. Did you want
dialog: the lift?
dialog: 
text: The cavalcade is passing the lifts. SAM backs away into
text: the open lift. The cavalcade passes on out of sight. The
text: lift contains a CHARLADY with a bucket and mop. She
text: remains in the lift as SAM joins her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 69 INT. THE LIFT					 69
dialog: 
text: SAM presses the button for the 50th floor. The lift doors
text: close on him and the CHARLADY. From somewhere far away
text: there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain. SAM glances
text: around the lift. There appears to be an air conditioning
text: vent in the ceiling.
dialog: 
text: SAM glances enquiringly at the CHARLADY who merely smiles
text: at him. Another scream is heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
text: The CHARLADY smiles again.
dialog: 
dialog: Doesn't that disturb you?
dialog: 
text: The CHARLADY fiddles with something in her ears and pulls
text: out a pair of wax earplugs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLADY
dialog: Beg your pardon?
dialog: 
text: The lift arrives.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 70 INT. 50TH FLOOR CORRIDOR			DAY		 70
dialog: 
text: The lift arrives. SAM steps out. The CHARLADY remains in
text: the lift. The doors close. SAM heads down surgically clean
text: white-tiled corridor.
dialog: 
text: Passing a white-coated TECHNICIAN monitoring what appears
text: to be electric meters, SAM comes to a door with 5001.
text: Above the door a red light is glowing. SAM knocks. The red
text: light goes out and a green light comes on. SAM enters.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 71 INT. ROOM 500l					DAY		 71
dialog: 
text: Inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but
text: the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant-
text: looking FEMALE typist, wearing headphones, chewing gum and
text: typing with great facility. SAM approaches the TYPIST who,
text: busily typing, twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently
text: mouths the words ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYPIST
dialog: It won't be long now.
dialog: (she carries on typing)
dialog: 
text: SAM nods, and stands quietly by her. He can hear tiny
text: sounds coming through her headphones. He looks down at the
text: piece of paper in the typewriter. He reacts a bit
text: strangely, perhaps even winces. We see he close up of the
text: words being struck crisply on paper.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON TYPEWRITER
text: AHHHH, Oh God ... No, don't ... UHH,
dialog: please ... I ... STOP!! I can't stand
text: ... AIIEEEE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYPIST
dialog: (quietly, still typing)
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: 
text: She is looking at SAM helpfully, holding one of the
dialog: earphones away from her ear. From this earphone we can
dialog: just hear quietly ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EARPHONE
dialog: Oooooooh ... aaaaaahhh ... please ...
dialog: arrrrrghhhh no ... please ... Oh God,
dialog: No ... No, stop, I don't know ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm looking for Officer 412/L.
dialog: 
text: The TYPIST nods smiling. She puts back the earphone and
text: carries on typing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYPIST
dialog: I'm sure he won't be long now.
dialog: 
text: She types a little more but suddenly stops.
dialog: 
dialog: I thought so!
dialog: 
text: She takes off the earphones and takes the paper and
text: carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all
dialog: the different copies.
dialog: 
text: Through the frosted glass door leading into the next area,
text: SAM can see a FIGURE come through a double door and turn
text: left, making a silly 'hi' sign to the TYPIST as he exits
text: from sight. She is charmed. Almost immediately after them,
text: a white-coated TECHNICIAN exits, but to the left.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TYPIST
dialog: You can go in now.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 72 INT. JACK'S OFFICE				 DAY		 72
dialog: 
text: SAM goes through the glass door and is about to push open
text: the double doors in front of him. He is halted by a noise
text: from the TYPIST - she indicates that he is to go to the
text: left. He does so and enters an office. An antique desk
text: with a large collection of executive toys and other
text: tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a
text: rather oddly shaped ... distorted as it by the curved wall
text: of the much larger room that SAM was stopped from
text: entering. Nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently
text: successful. A buzzing noise draws SAM's attention to the
text: wash basin in the far corner. The Information Retrieval
text: TECHNICIAN is standing by a sink massing his temples with
text: old-fashioned scalp vibrators. His back to us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Excuse me. Are you officer 412/L?
dialog: 
text: The TECHNICIAN makes no sign of having heard this. He
text: continues vibrating his temples.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (a bit louder)
dialog: Er, excuse me!
dialog: 
text: Getting no response SAM walks over to the TECHNICIAN. As
text: he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face
text: down on the desk top. It seems strangely familiar - but as
text: it is a negative concave image SAM isn't sure. He
text: continues over to the TECHNICIAN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Excuse me.
dialog: 
text: He touches the TECHNICIAN on the shoulder, who jumps with
text: a start. He spins around and turns out to be none other
text: than JACK LINT. He is amazed to see SAM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Jack!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (recovering slightly)
dialog: SAM! What a surprise!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (even more surprised)
dialog: Are you officer 412/L?
dialog: 
text: JACK looks confused. He pauses, and then removes ear
text: plugs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (shaking Sam's hand)
dialog: Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told
dialog: me you were coming aboard -
dialog: congratulations!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: For my sins. Are you settling in
dialog: alright?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes, thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped
dialog: by. Unfortunately, I don't have any
dialog: time right now I've got a queue of
dialog: customers to deal with - er, why
dialog: don't we have a drink tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (diffidently)
dialog: Ah ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't want to take up your time
dialog: now, but I was hoping you could give
dialog: me some information on somebody. It's
dialog: a security level three matter and
dialog: Information Retrieval records says to
dialog: refer to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: OK. Come back this afternoon, about
dialog: four o'clock. If you give me the
dialog: number of the case, I'll have the
dialog: dossier here waiting.
text: (he pulls card from his
text: pocket - pushes it towards
dialog: Sam)
dialog: My tailor,... well worth the
dialog: investment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (taking print-out sheets
dialog: from his pocket)
dialog: I've got numbers all over these - I'm
dialog: not sure which is the one you want.

speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: shoulder)
dialog: Layton! Oh shit!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You clever bastard! I might have
dialog: guessed. You only moved in today and
dialog: you're already hot on the bloody
dialog: trail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Am I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other
dialog: on this one. If you make a reputation with this case,
dialog: it'll be at my expense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How much do you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Not much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Enough though, eh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (getting sucked into this
dialog: exchange)
dialog: Not really, no.
dialog: 
text: JACK goes over to the sink and turns on the taps full
text: blast, splashing the water noisily into the basin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: OK. OK. Let's not fence around ...
dialog: This is the situation. Some idiot
text: somewhere in the building, some
dialog: insect, confused two of our clients,
speaker_heading: B58/732 and T47/215.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Christ! You do know it all!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning
dialog: Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, your A. Buttle has been
text: confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle.
dialog: I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should
dialog: be shot for that. So B58/732 was
text: pulled in by mistake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You got the wrong man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (a little heated)
dialog: I did not get the wrong man. I got
dialog: the right man. The wrong man was
dialog: delivered to me as the right man! I
dialog: accepted him, on trust, as the right
dialog: man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to
dialog: the confusion, he died on us. Which,
dialog: had he been the right man, he
dialog: wouldn't have done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You killed him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Sam, there are very rigid parameters
dialog: laid down to avoid that event but
dialog: Buttle's heart condition did not
dialog: appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think
dialog: I'm dismissing this business, Sam.
dialog: I've lost a week's sleep over it
dialog: already.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sure you have
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There are some real bastards in this
dialog: department who don't mind breaking a
dialog: few eggs to make an omelette, but
dialog: thank God there are the new boys like
dialog: me who want to maintain decent
dialog: civilized standards of terrorist
dialog: eradication. We've got the upper hand
text: for the moment, but they're waiting
dialog: for us to slip up, and a little slip-
dialog: up like this is just the chance
dialog: they're looking for.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So how ...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What I've got to do now is pick up
text: Tuttle, interrogate him at the same
dialog: voltage as Buttle, to the same meter
text: reading to the last penny, and juggle
dialog: the books in electrical banking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What has Tuttle done?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We suspect him of freelance
dialog: subversion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (dumbly)
dialog: He's a freelance subversive?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He's a compulsive heating engineer. A
dialog: maverick ex-Central Service repair
text: man with a grudge against society.
dialog: Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of
dialog: the wood, I think. At least we will
dialog: be when I get this Layton woman under
dialog: arrest.
dialog: 
text: JACK turns off taps and goes behind screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: What's she done?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You didn't know as much about this
dialog: business as you pretended to, did
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Er ... no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Very smart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Er ... but I would've found out
dialog: anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes. I'm impressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (playing the game)
dialog: Tell me about Layton.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the
dialog: Buttle arrest - and since then she's
dialog: been making wild allegations,
text: obviously trying to exploit the
dialog: situation - she's working for
dialog: somebody, and she's not working for
dialog: us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A terrorist?
dialog: 
text: JACK comes from behind the screen with a look confirming
text: just what SAM fears, and hands him a suit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ah ... thanks.
dialog: 
text: SAM begins to put the suit on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: But surely, I mean, perhaps she just
dialog: happened to live above the Buttles,
dialog: and ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (picking up photograph of
dialog: wife and kids from his
dialog: desk)
dialog: Look after that suit, eh. Barbara
dialog: chose it for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Right. Er, you're not going to keep
dialog: calling her Barbara, are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Barbara's a perfectly good name,
dialog: isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (preferring to let his
dialog: drop)
dialog: Look, about the Layton woman - maybe
text: she's just trying to help the Buttle
dialog: family.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: {baffled)
dialog: I don't follow you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Out of kindness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (utterly baffled)
dialog: Kindness? What's the purpose behind
dialog: this line of enquiry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (deciding to abandon this
dialog: line of country)
dialog: So what are you going to do about
dialog: her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get her out of circulation - I've put
text: her on the detention list.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (thinking fast)
dialog: You mean you're going to invite her
dialog: in so that she can spill the beans
dialog: inside the department?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Well, I ... Good point. What do you
dialog: suggest?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let me try to get to her. I'll
dialog: deactivate her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What does that mean? I don't want to
dialog: be involved in anything unsavoury.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Of course. We went to school
dialog: together. You're my oldest friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And you're mine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're the only person I can trust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Then we'd better keep this business
dialog: just between the two of us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right! Just between as and the
dialog: Security Forces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They weren't at school with us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But, I've already put her on the
dialog: search and detain list.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Take her off the list.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There's no procedure for that until
text: she's been arrested.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Say it was a mistake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We don't make mistakes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, I'd better get out there and
dialog: try to get to her before security
dialog: does. Let me borrow her dossier for a
dialog: while.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Er ... alright. For Christ's sake
dialog: don't lose it. Here, you'd better
dialog: sign for it.
dialog: 
text: JACK presents SAM with something to sign. He then gives
dialog: him the dossier.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.

speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: pauses)
dialog: Trust me.

speaker_heading: JACK

scene_heading: 74 INT. LIFT						DAY		 74
dialog: 
text: Slightly unnerved, SAM gets in the lift, pushes the button
text: for his floor - the 30th - and immediately begins perusing
text: JILL's dossier. The lift descends. But unnoticed by SAM
text: continued past his floor without stopping. It stops at the
text: Lobby Mezzanine. SAM looks up and realizes he is on the
text: wrong floor. Angrily he pushes the correct floor number
text: but before the doors close he hears an angry woman's voice
text: echoing through the massive lobby. He looks in the
text: direction of the porters desk. There stands JILL arguing
text: with the PORTER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: But you've stamped this form before!
dialog: Why won't you stamp it now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: You've just said yourself, Miss,
dialog: we've already stamped it. Why should
dialog: we stamp it twice?
dialog: 
text: SAM is frozen. He can't believe what he sees. The lift
text: doors close. SAM is too slow to stop them. Madly he pushes
text: the buttons - to no effect. The lift descends. (At this
dialog: point we had better describe the lift. It is a cross
text: between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille
text: doors and the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall
text: in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of
text: dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the
dialog: Ministry.)
dialog: 
text: SAM can see JILL and if JILL were to look up she could see
text: SAM descending. He is shouting and rattling the bars of
text: the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention.
text: SAM sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying
text: to stop the demon lift. From his POV we see JILL
text: disappearing from view still arguing with the PORTER.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 75 INT. BASEMENT					 DAY		 75
dialog: 
text: The lift comes to rest. SAM is still trying to get it to
text: respond and return him to the lobby. TWO TECHNICIANS are
text: waiting as the doors open. From SAM's POV he sees them
text: hang a sign on the door and walk away. He bangs the
text: buttons for another moment with no result. He looks out of
text: the lift and is able to read the sign - "LIFT OUT OF
text: ORDER". Frantically he looks around for another lift. All
text: the others are on distant floors - then he spots one off
text: to one side, its doors standing open. Rushing over to it
text: he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number - but
text: there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters. Before
text: he can sort this out a voice shouts at him.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: DROP IT!!
dialog: 
text: JILL has only the form in her hand - which she dutifully

dialog: 
text: SAM rushes out of the door leading to the stairs. He can't
text: believe the sight that greets him. He responds
dialog: instinctively,
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: STOP! Let her go!
dialog: 
text: He rushes over to the Porter's desk just as the GUARDS
text: behind him come through the door. He doesn't have a clue
text: what he is going to do but, as he reaches the group of
text: GUARDS they snap attention. Confused he looks around and
text: then realizes his I.D. badge, is on his lapel and the
text: GUARDS are responding as trained. The GUARDS chasing him
text: screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well done ... uh ... excellent work

dialog: 
text: SAM sees the trail of dossier litter blowing about the

text: SAM is torn between trying to regain the pages of the

speaker_heading: JILL.

scene_heading: 87 EXT. POWER PLANT		 DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)	 87
dialog:

text: murk can be seen sinister-looking FIGURES in protective
text: clothing and hard hats.
dialog: 
text: This is the world which is now entered by JILL's lorry ...
text: The lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and
text: JILL jumps down from the cab. SAM stays inside, looking
text: around. Something catches his eye.
dialog: 
text: CUT to facade of house. Window boxes with flowers and
text: shrubbery surrounded by a white picket fence provide
text: domestic charm, however, in the doorway stands a MAN with
text: protective clothing and something like a gas-mask over his
text: face. He is waving to someone. Slowly the house rises out
dialog: of frame.
dialog: 
text: In a WIDER SHOT we can see the house is suspended from and
text: a giant crane that swings it through the air - air filled
text: with stead, smoke, evil-smelling fumes. It is lowered onto
text: the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one
dialog: of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of
dialog: the power plant.

scene_heading: 88 INT. LORRY CAB					DAY		 88
dialog: 
text: SAM watches JILL walk away from the lorry and enter the

text: start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a
text: compartment which seems to be full of maps, rags, etc. He
text: gets grease on sleeve of his suit. In the space behind the
text: seats he finds the pieces of luggage which JILL had
text: carried away from the flat. He starts to examine this
text: cautiously and is startled by the sudden opening of the
text: cab door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Don't act guilty. Act like me. I'm
dialog: just getting on with my job. Or, are
dialog: you just getting on with yours?
dialog:

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's going on here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What does it look like ... I'm

dialog: 
text: The lorry stops and JILL gets out. From SAM'S P.O.V., the
text: house suspended from the crane starts moving through the
text: sky towards the lorry. He glances back to see JILL slip a

scene_heading: 89 EXT. LORRY						LATE AFTERNOON 89
dialog: 
text: SAM climbs down from the cab trying to keep an eye on
text: JILL. He ends up standing next to a rusty Kodak Photospot
text: standard. The picture on it - though faded by pollution -
text: is of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by
text: the murk and mess of the power plant. JILL has made her
text: way over to a rather SHADOWY FIGURE lurking around the
text: corner of one of the metal structures. They appear to be
text: exchanging parcels. SAM is worried by this suspicious
text: behaviour - reinforced as it is by a Ministry poster on
text: the side of the building that illustrates, almost
text: identically, the action we have just seen along with the
text: warning: "MIND THAT PARCEL. EAGLE EYES CAN SAVE A LIFE".

text: During the above speech a SMALL BOY on a tricycle "roars"
text: around a corner behind the SECURITY POLICE. He rides into
text: a gap between them, rolls his tricycle over and "takes
text: cover" behind it. He points his toy rifle at JILL's lorry
text: and takes shot. In reaction to the noise made by the kid's
text: rifle the OFFICER IN CHARGE dives for cover and the
text: SECURITY TROOPS open fire and pepper JILL's lorry cab with
text: holes. A few of the SECURITY TROOPS then rush forward and
text: fling open the cab door. The cab is empty. The OFFICER IN
text: CHARGE gets to his feet and looks about. His uniform is
text: covered with dust, oil and shit from the street. He just
text: misses seeing the back of the BOY as he disappears round
text: the corner on his tricycle.

text: To the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering
dialog: sensuous, supportive world of ladies undergarments. As we
text: slip past girdles, bras, panti-hose for a variety of
text: exotic occasions we come upon SAM and JILL pushing a
text: shopping trolley. In the trolley is the "suspicious"
dialog: parcel which JILL was given at the power plant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is a hell of a time to buy a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Are you still following me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Please, Jill ... I love you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Go away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: There are plenty of other safe
dialog: places. Why don't we go back to my
dialog: flat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Leave me alone!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You've got to trust me. It sounds
dialog: silly but I know we were meant to
dialog: meet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: You mean you were meant to hijack my
dialog: truck, make me crash it, and have
dialog: every security man in town looking
dialog: for me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I vas just trying to help. I decided
dialog: to trust you. Maybe I was wrong.
dialog: Whose side are you on really? Who are
dialog: your friends? Who was the man who
dialog: gave you the parcel? What's in it?
dialog: It's the only thing you saved from
dialog: the lorry .... It must he something
dialog: very special.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I saved you from the lorry and you're
dialog: not very special.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: ........... It's a bomb isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Oh ... Jesus!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm going to open it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (grabbing parcel and trying
dialog: to take it from him)
dialog: No you're not!
dialog: 
text: They start an ugly little struggle for the parcel. SAM's
text: suit gets slightly ripped. Their tug-of-war is interrupted
text: by a voice off camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: SAM!!
dialog: 
text: SAM turns to see MRS TERRAIN and SHIRLEY a short distance
text: away. MRS TERRAIN is heavily bandaged and sitting in a
text: wheelchair which SHIRLEY is pushing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: It's me and Shirley!
dialog: 
text: From the TERRAINS' POV SAM looks as if he is wrestling
text: with a dummy, or with himself if he is beside a full
text: length mirror. The mirror or something obscures JILL. MRS
text: TERRAIN and SHIRLEY exchange puzzled looks and proceed
text: toward SAM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets
text: go of the parcel and pushes JILL
text: away. She moves off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (after Jill for Mrs
dialog: Terrain's benefit)
dialog: I think that'll hold it.

dialog: Hello Shirley. Just helping someone

dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: My complication had a complication,

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Trying to keep an eye on

dialog: Er, yes ...

speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN

speaker_heading: MRS TERRAIN
dialog: (coyly)
dialog: Picture me in these.
dialog: 
text: At this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far
dialog: corner of the store. It is the corner that we last saw
text: JILL moving towards. SAM races towards the smoke, dust
text: covering his suit. He finds bras, knickers, broken shop
text: dummies, bleeding CUSTOMERS and SHOP ASSISTANTS all over
text: the place. On the edge of this devastated area he sees
text: JILL struggling out from under a pile of negligees and
text: plaster dust. He rushes over to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (anxiety giving way to

dialog: You don't deserve to be! You should
dialog: be dead, or maimed like them .... How
dialog: could you ...?
dialog: (indicating the wounded)
dialog: What a bloody stupid thing ... I
dialog: should. have made you open it in the
dialog: lorry
dialog: 
text: She has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it
text: open. Under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured.
dialog: Christmas packages - yes you guessed it - executive toys.
text: She throws the parcel and its contents hard into SAM's
text: chest. He topples back-wards - tangling himself up with
text: the severed limbs of a shop dummy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: There's your bomb! Our annual bribes
dialog: for official ass-holes like you!
dialog: 
text: SAM sits in the debris - ashamed and relieved. Liquor
text: oozes from the broken bottle all over SAM's suit. He is at
dialog: a loss for words.
dialog: 
text: JILL's attention is attracted by moans coming from the
text: badly hurt BOMB VICTIMS. She goes to help them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (to Sam)
dialog: Come on, make yourself useful, there
dialog: are people hurt!
dialog: 
text: JILL goes around trying to make the INJURED comfortable.
text: SAM follows her. He takes off his jacket with his
text: Information Retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to
text: make a pillow for one of these VICTIMS. By now sirens are
text: wailing, water sprinklers are functioning, and there is
text: general pandemonium. SECURITY GUARDS run into the area and
text: begin arresting everyone, including the DEAD and INJURED.
text: ONE OF THE GUARDS tries to drag off the WOMAN whom JILL is
dialog: attending.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Hey stop ... she's hurt!
dialog: 
text: The GUARD gives JILL a thump in the side of the face with
text: his gloved hand. SAM sees red.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: DON'T TOUCH HER!!
dialog: 
text: The GUARD looks up and as he does so he is transformed
text: into the GIANT WARRIOR from SAM's dream. He towers over
text: the WOUNDED, the DYING and the debris of the blasted
text: lingerie department. SAM grabs for a weapon and comes up
text: with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy. It
dialog: makes a passable club.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: SAM .... don't!!
dialog: 
text: The TWO COMBATANTS square off ... looking for an opening

scene_heading: 108a	 INT.						STONE SHIPANTI-DAY108a
dialog: 
text: SAM is falling down the inner wall of the stone ship. He

speaker_heading: SAM

scene_heading: 109 INT. BLACK MARIA				 EVENING	 109
dialog: 
text: The BAGGEES hang from a track on the ceiling of the Black

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD A
dialog: I'm lucky, I've got thick eyebrows.

dialog: Who's he?

speaker_heading: GUARD A
dialog: Someone from Information Retrieval

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Jill! Jill! Are you there?!
dialog: 
text: He begins rummaging through the BAGGEES. ONE of which is
text: dressed as FATHER CHRISTMAS. SAM opens the "face vent" of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD A
dialog: Excuse me, sir - that's government

text: At this point SAM's desk begins, as before, to creep
text: through the wall. He grabs it violently. He pulls it.
text: There is a scream from the other side of the wall. SAM

dialog: 
text: SAM is leaving the Ministry of Information Retrieval. The
text: lights in the foyer are blazing behind him, the street
text: lamps are lit. He is exhausted and depressed and anxious
text: about the safety and whereabouts of Jill. He begins to
text: retrace their first journey together, down the Ministry

scene_heading: 117a	 EXT.						JUST AROUND THE

dialog: 
text: SAM stands in the passageway where JILL's lorry was first
text: parked. The only hint of its once-upon-a-time presence is
text: a small splodge of oil by the kerb. SAM stands lost and
text: beaten under a street light. He slumps down to the
text: pavement unsure his next move. The street light is
text: reflected in the pool of oil. As he stares at the
text: reflected light it expands and becomes a patch of blue
text: cloud-filled sky. SAM turns to look at the actual street
text: light. It has become a crack of blazing light coming thru
text: the inner wall of the great stone ship.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 117b	 INT.						STONE SHIPANTI-DAY117b
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DREAM GIRL'S VOICE
dialog: I'm here Sam. Don't give up.
dialog: 
text: SAM is pushing thru the GREY PRISONERS. The light from the
text: crack shafts across the space in which they find
text: themselves imprisoned, striking the opposite wall. There
text: in the bright pool of light are SAM's wings - beautiful,
text: shimmering silver... But, nailed to a large stone
text: cruciform - like a crucified eagle. SAM rushes towards
text: them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a
text: great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a
text: black shadow falls across SAM and the wings. Looking round
text: he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of the
text: floor - but, blocking the opening is the GIANT SAMURAI
text: WARRIOR. SAM draws his sword and rushes toward the GIANT.
text: The GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he
text: raises his spear in front of himself in an almost
text: religious gesture. Poof! He vanishes! SAM is confused.
text: Suddenly a PRISONER shouts a warning and SAM spins round
text: just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the gigantic
text: WARRIOR who is now standing directly behind him. SAM
text: parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then
text: strikes with his sword. At thin air! The GIANT has
text: vanished again. SAM can't figure it out. But he hears
text: something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the GIANT who
text: is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down.
text: Again SAM manages a few parries as he is forced backwards.
text: He trips and falls to the ground. The spear goes into the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
text: Before the GIANT can wrench the spear loose, SAM slashes
text: at him with his sword. But again the GIANT disappears. SAM
text: spins around. The GIANT is a short distance from him. SAM
text: rushes him. Again he vanishes. This time he reappears next
text: to the spear and tries to free it. But SAM attacks again
text: and the GIANT is forced to do his vanishing act before he
text: can recover the spear. SAM is becoming exasperated with
text: his behaviour, and as the GIANT reappears he shouts at him
text: to hold still, at the same time throwing his sword at the
text: big fellow. The sword pins the GIANT's foot to the ground
text: before he can disappear. Instead of blood pouring from the
text: wound, fire issues forth. SAM takes advantage of the
text: situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground.
text: The GIANT is unable to escape as SAM charges, but manages
text: to dodge a bit. However the spear catches his arm and
text: opens a gash. Again fire pours out. As the big GUY tries
text: to stop the fire, SAM charges again. This time he succeeds
text: in striking dead centre. The GIANT gasps as fire gushes
text: from his chest. He staggers and crashes to the ground. The
text: wounds continue to bleed fire.
dialog: 
text: SAM gets his breath back and approaches the fallen
text: WARRIOR. Reaching down he removed the GIANT's mask. Fire
text: rushes forth from all the facial orifices. But the thing
text: that makes him catch his breath is the face itself. It's
text: his ... SAM's! While he stares in amazement the fire
text: begins to melt the face. In a moment it is unrecognizable.
text: SAM stands there stunned. Somewhere in the distance a bell
dialog: tolls.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 118 EXT. JUST AROUND THE CORNER		 NIGHT		118
dialog: 
text: SAM's face is reflected in the puddle of oil. He is
text: staring wide-eyed. A church bell tolls in the distance.
text: SAM is definitely spooked. He scrambles to his feet. He's
text: got to get out of here. He heads off down the passageway
text: but is brought quickly to a halt. There, in the shadows,
text: is SOMEONE smoking a cigarette. He hesitates and reverses
text: direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice
text: comes from behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: You're late.
dialog: 
text: SAM spins around. Stepping out from the shadows is JILL -

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me
dialog: through to Mr Helpmann's office?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And you can't tell me what the proper

speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: I'm glad to see the Ministry's

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 125 INT. BASEMENT					 NIGHT		125
dialog: 
text: SAM creeps along the corridor to the lift door - avoiding

text: harmony. ONE GUARD is conducting and giving instruction.
text: They are all incredibly big and brutal looking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHOIR MASTER

dialog: 
text: The CHOIR begins singing again. SAM reaches the lift and
text: looks at the small panel of letters set into the wall.
text: CLOSE UP of SAM's face concentrating. He hears, we hear, a
text: reprise of MR HELPMANN talking to SAM in MOTHER's
dialog: bathroom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HELPMANN (V/O)
dialog: Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,
dialog: but we were close friends, and I keep

text: office. No reply. He slowly opens door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mr Helpmann? Are you there? Hello?
dialog: 
text: The office is empty. SAM looks around - not sure what he
text: wants to do. He notices his MOTHER's picture on HELPMANN's
text: desk. He is just about to leave when his eye is caught by
text: an elaborate computer console in a side room. It
text: occasionally chatters away. Paper print-outs fill a large
text: bin. Hesitantly SAM approaches it. Looking around to make
text: sure the room is still empty he punches the On key and the
text: machine lights up.
dialog: 
text: He cautiously pushes a couple more keys. The teleprinter
text: machines have paused but one starts chattering now. He
text: looks at the one which is busy. A CLOSE UP shows us the
scene_heading: message coming through: TOTAL - TOTAL -TOTAL - CAR 15
scene_heading: REQUEST FEEDBACK STATUS ON SUBJECT BENJAMIN GEORGE
scene_heading: TROLLOPE - VAGRANT - DETAINED TERRORIST/SUSPECT/ASSOCIATE.
text: This is followed by a code number. The teleprinter falls
dialog: silent.
dialog: 
text: SAM returns to the keyboard and switches it off. He turns
dialog: to leave.
text: The teleprinter starts chattering again. SAM stops and
text: goes back to it and looks at the page again. A CLOSE UP
scene_heading: shows us: UPDATE - SUBJECT TROLLOPE DECEASED - CAUSE OF
scene_heading: DEATH GUNSHOT RESISTING ARREST. PLEASE DELETE FROM SPECIAL
text: CATEGORY. The computer spool revolves back and forth for
text: two or three seconds and then stops. SAM ponders this for
text: a moment and then heads back to the keyboard and swtiches

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (cautiously)
dialog: Jill?
dialog: 
text: Getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through.

text: SAM's MOTHER's wigs which billows in the air blown by a
text: fan. She is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed
text: from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly. She

text: He is a tiny speck but, overjoyed -he has found the day.
text: far below him the GREY PRISONERS gather beaming with
text: happiness. Diving back to the ground - SAM unsheaths his
text: sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of
text: the great columns. The FORCES OF DARKNESS who have been
text: lurking in the shadows slink back. SAM, with one mighty
text: swing, strikes the column - the noise reverberates as
text: cracks begin to race up and through the column. It is
text: disintegrating. As it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to
text: topple. Everyone steps back. Down it plummets. And smashes
text: into a million pieces. The bright blue sky escapes in all
text: directions. The GREY PRISONERS' iron collars and chains
text: fall from their necks as they stand, surrounded by a

dialog: indeterminate number of personnel
dialog: carriers. Taking possession under

dialog: Obstructing the forces of law and

dialog: Giving aid and comfort to the enemies
dialog: of society.
dialog: Bringing into disrepute the good name
dialog: of the Government, and the standing
dialog: within the community of the
dialog: Department of Information Retrieval.
text: Attempting to disrupt the Ministry of
dialog: Information Retrieval's internal
text: communicating systems. Wasting
dialog: Ministry time and paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL B
dialog: We would advise you that a plea of
dialog: guilty will save you and the tax
dialog: payer money, and will always be
dialog: looked upon more favourably than a
dialog: plea of not guilty. All you are
dialog: requested to do at this stage is to
dialog: sign this form.
dialog:

speaker_heading: OFFICIAL A
dialog: Right. Next!
dialog: 
text: The SECURITY GUARD appears briefly and zips up the hood
text: again plunging us back into darkness. We get more muffled
text: shouts, heavy breathing and subterranean son et lumiere.
dialog: 
text: Another SECURITY GUARD opens the flap on SAM's hood. We
text: see another TWO OFFICIALS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (more hysterical)
dialog: Where's Jill? What's happened to
dialog: Jill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL C
dialog: 93/HKS/608, you've got quite a list
dialog: of misdemeanours here, haven't you?
dialog: All this is going to take time and
dialog: money, and I'm afraid, according to
dialog: your bank statement and credit rating
dialog: here, you're likely to be in deep
dialog: financial trouble by the end of it.
dialog: Now, either you plead guilty to say,
dialog: seven or eight of these charges,
dialog: which'll bring the costs down to
dialog: within your reach, or you can borrow
dialog: a sum to be negotiated, from us, at
dialog: very competitive rates. We can offer
dialog: you something at say, eleven and a
dialog: half per cent, over thirty years. But
dialog: you will have to buy insurance to
dialog: qualify for his scheme.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL D
dialog: All you have to do is to agree to
dialog: sign the appropriate boxes on these
dialog: forms. Yes or no?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not guilty! Not guilty you stupid
dialog: bastar...
dialog: 
text: THE GUARD closes the flap. Once again darkness and
text: confusion. until another SECURITY GUARD opens the flap
text: again to reveal another TWO OFFICIALS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL E
dialog: (examining forms)
dialog: Now, since you've elected to plead
dialog: not guilty on all these charges,
dialog: you'd be well advised to take some
dialog: sort of insurance cover. Preferably
dialog: comprehensive, or if you'd prefer,
dialog: something more specific - say,
dialog: against electrical charges over
dialog: f70.00. And for food and
dialog: accommodation costs of say, £800.00.
dialog: Detention can be a very expensive
dialog: business.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL F
dialog: Now, before we bore you with the
dialog: small print perhaps you'd like to
dialog: tell us whether you'd like to sign
dialog: this insurance acceptance form or
dialog: not. Think carefully before you
dialog: decide. Thinking ahead in financial
dialog: matters is always the wise course.
dialog: 
text: The flap is closed and opened again very quickly - NEW
text: OFFICIALS are revealed. This process repeats again and
text: again - getting faster and faster. The OFFICIALS' faces
text: seem to become a changing blur. Their voices overlap in a
text: growing cacophony. The desk and the other items in the
text: room remain static. To add to this disturbing effect the
text: FORCES OF DARKNESS begin to gather in the room behind the
text: OFFICIALS. As they increase in number they begin to press
text: forward unseen by the OFFICIALS. Soon they fill the view
text: through the flap.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 133 INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM				 133
dialog: 
text: The bag comes off. SAM finds himself strapped into an
text: Information Retrieval chair. The CAMERA tracks back
text: frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an
text: unbelievably vast room. The walls curve up and out of
dialog: sight.
dialog: 
text: The floor doesn't seem to be a floor at all - strange
text: light undulates beneath. The whole effect is one of total
text: disorientation and overwhelming size. SAM is desperately
text: trying to take it in. Next to the chair is a porcelain
text: tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments.
text: Worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at
text: hand. As the GUARDS leave SAM to take up their positions
text: near the distant door they hand over documents to the
text: white-coated INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OFFICER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: 11/AFT/607, sir.
dialog: 
text: They all sign the document which the I.R. OFFICER retains
text: after giving carbon copies to the GUARDS. The GUARDS then
text: proceed to the door and take up positions on either side
text: of it. The I.R. OFFICER heads toward SAM. We can now see
text: he wears a mask. It is the face of the FORCES OF DARKNESS.
text: A smiling baby doll face. SAM sits, mesmerized, watching
text: him approach. Within fifteen or twenty yards of SAM the
text: I.R. OFFICER comes to an abrupt halt. He seems to sway.
text: After a moment he turns slightly, hesitantly, giving the
text: impression that he may return to the door. He looks at the
text: GUARDS, pauses, straightens himself up, takes a deep
text: breath and continues again towards SAM, rather more
text: briskly than before. SAM watches, terrified and
text: fascinated. The I.R. OFFICER goes to the table which is
text: covered with evil-looking surgical-type instruments - he
text: blunders clumsily into it, knocking a couple of them onto
text: the floor. He picks then up quickly and replaces them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Jack?
dialog: 
text: The I.R. OFFICER reacts to this as if he's been hit in the

text: and advances on SAM.

dialog: 
text: JACK is very close to SAM, he is shaking. He lifts up his

dialog: Shut up! This is a professional

dialog: 
text: JACK comes at SAM with the horrifying implement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: JACK!! ... You can't ... No, don't!
dialog: 
text: SAM's eyes widen in terror. From his POV we look up at
text: JACK approaching. The ceiling above and behind JACK is
text: suddenly and. loudly penetrated by the Ceiling Hole
text: Machine, and in an instant without benefit of "fireman's
text: pole", the commando-like figure of MR TUTTLE gun in hand,
text: leaps through the hole.
text: TUTTLE is immediately followed by similar looking MEN with
text: balaclavas, guerilla-type clothing, and very efficient
text: guns. JACK is cut down. So are the TWO GUARDS who have
text: opened the door from the corridor and are shooting into
dialog: the room.
dialog: 
text: TUTTLE raps out into a walkie-talkie
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUTTLE
dialog: Detonate!
dialog: 
text: From somewhere near at hand there is a large explosion

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 135 INT. ENDLESS STAIRWAYS			 NIGHT		135
dialog: 
text: CUT to RESCUERS, their members thinning, and SAM, fighting

dialog: bleeding and -
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 136 INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY	 NIGHT		136
dialog: 
text: CUT to the RESCUERS fighting their way to the entrance.
text: Another group of RESCUERS at the door are providing cover
text: fire The PORTER sits behind his desk watching the battle
text: on his bank of monitors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 2ND GROUP
dialog: 
dialog: Quick! We've only got thirty seconds
dialog: to get clear!
dialog: 
text: TUTTLE tosses SAM a dark overcoat to cover his light grey
text: detainee outfit. Together, the TWO GROUPS burst out
text: through the door into the large empty forecourt.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 137 EXT. FORECOURT					NIGHT		137
dialog: 
text: The forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights.
text: Machine gun installations open fire. The RESCUERS are
text: totally exposed.
dialog: 
text: They are cut down left and right.
text: Desperately they battle their way across the open space.
text: Time running out. SAM, knowing the way, leads TUTTLE
text: towards a shielded spot. Will they make it? As the last
text: RESCUER is cut down SAM and TUTTLE dive for cover.
text: KOWBLAMMPOW! A massive explosion. Then another. And
text: another. SECURITY TROOPS caught unprotected are decimated.
text: SAM looks up. Christ! The building is being blown to bits.
text: Certain windows are lit. They spell out MERRY XMAS. With a
text: final massive haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser
text: of masonry, steel, paper and dozens of T.V. consoles and
text: visual aid apparatus including, in large chunks, MR
text: HELPMANN's masterpiece. But also tons and tons of paper.
dialog: 
text: Every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected
text: its load skywards. The night sky is full of white
text: rectangular wisps. Ashlike they flutter down over the
text: city. SAM looks around and can't see TUTTLE anywhere. He
text: shouts for him. But the remaining TROOPS have spotted SAM
text: and SAM runs.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 139 EXT. SHOPPING					 PRECINCT	NIGHT139
dialog: 
text: Eluding his pursuers, SAM dives into a crowded, garishly
text: lit, shopping centre. Once among the protective company of
text: he mindlessly shopping MOB, SAM slows down and proceeds
text: casually. The SHOPPERS go about their programmed business
text: paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them.
text: Searching the CROWD, SAM spots TUTTLE making his way
text: towards him. TUTTLE is having a bit of trouble walking
text: against the steadily increasing wind. As he proceeds
text: across an open area a blown piece of paper. catches on his
text: foot. He tries shaking it off.
dialog: 
text: It remains firmly stuck. While he is struggling with the
text: piece of paper another, larger piece catches his other
text: leg. He begins to lose his temper trying to dislodge the
text: flying debris. Another hits him and twists around his arm.
text: Still more paper blows against him. He is having
text: difficulty staying upright. Twisting this way and that he
text: tries to free himself, but more and more paper covers him.
text: He is practically obscured from view. SAM can't believe
text: what he is seeing. SHOPPERS continue about their business,
text: apparently unaware of TUTTLE'S terrible plight. Apart from
text: ONE SHOPPER who loses control of her shopping trolley -
text: and watches it career down the steps of the shopping
text: precinct. By now TUTTLE is totally encased in this cocoon
text: of litter. He is now just a ball of paper writhing about
text: on the ground. SAM has to do something. He rushes out from
text: his hiding place and tries to pull the litter off TUTTLE.
text: The pieces come loose with surprising ease. The wind
text: carries them away as SAM frantically tears at the pile.
text: But there is no sign of TUTTLE. Nothing. The last few
text: pieces of paper flutter away leaving SAM standing there
text: with a couple of posters in his hands. He realises that he
text: is suddenly very visible. All the shopping bustle has
text: stopped. They are all staring at him. SAM spots TROOPS
text: shouldering their way towards him. He turns tail and
text: dashes off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 140 INT. MOTHER'S FLAT				 NIGHT		140
dialog: 
text: The drawing room door burst open as SAM dashes in. SAM
text: goes straight through and into the bedroom. The room is
text: empty of all terrestrial human life forms. A hollow wind
text: blows the curtains.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 141 INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM			 NIGHT		141
dialog: 
text: The room is in chaos (and there is a hole in the ceiling).
text: SAM turns and sees a silhouette in the doorway. He rushes
dialog: forwards.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 142 INT. MOTHER'S FRONT DOOR NIGHT 142
dialog: 
text: But it's MATTHEWS the porter who is at the door watching
text: SAM running towards him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATTHEWS
dialog: (piously)
dialog: A sad loss. Your mother was with her
dialog: at the end. The doctor said there was
dialog: no pain.
dialog: 
text: SAM grabs MATTHEWS round the neck and shakes him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Where is she?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 143 EXT	A CORNER					 NIGHT		143
dialog: 
text: SAM comes running around corner. He is suddenly bathed in
text: a strange blue light. He halts and looks up. There
text: opposite him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance
text: to a chapel of dully modernistic design. Holy music from
text: an electric organ can be heard. SAM rushes up the stops
text: and through the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 144 INT. CHAPEL OF OUR LADY OF THE CHECK-OUT COUNTER NIGHT 144
dialog: 
text: CUT to SAM slipping into the chapel (in tight spot) and
text: suddenly being confronted by SPIRO the Maitre D.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: Ah, yes, Mr Lowry. It's so good you
dialog: could make it. Right this way.
dialog: 
text: SAM, dumbfounded, follows.
dialog: 
text: CUT to SAM being lead into the middle of the cold, modern
text: chapel which, possibly for the occasion, has been tarted
text: up with some red velvet curtains that help make it a bit
text: theatrical. A large flower-smothered coffin rests on some
text: sort of raised stand in front of the altar, a VICAR stands
text: in the pulpit, and a fair sprinkling of PEOPLE sit in
text: stepped seats on three sides of the room.
dialog: 
text: The coffin is closed, but a length of bandage has escaped
text: the lid. Standing amidst the floral tributes is a large,
text: rather idealized, colour portrait of MRS TERRAIN looking
text: not so much young as beautiful. Among the MOURNERS are DRS
text: JAFFE and CHAPMAN and others in their operating gowns.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: To enlarge on the scene, we see SHIRLEY T snuffling in her
text: hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves, the
text: VICAR standing in his pulpit waiting to get on with it,
text: etc. CUT to SAM trying to take all this in, stopping in
text: the middle of the room. Don't forget DR CHAPMAN sobbing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: (stopping and looking back
dialog: at Sam)
dialog: Mrs Lowry? Mrs Lowry is ...
dialog: 
text: In the background the VICAR begins speaking, and we hear
text: his voice throughout the following action. CUT TO SAM'S
dialog: POV ....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICAR (in background)
dialog: At these times of giving and
dialog: receiving let's remember the greatest
dialog: gift of all: not a gift to be
dialog: spurned, not a gift to be opened and
text: carelessly set on one side, not a
dialog: gift to be taken back and changed,
dialog: but the gift of eternal life. Mrs
dialog: Terrain has just received that most
dialog: wonderful of all gifts. She came to
dialog: us physically new, she goes hence
dialog: from us not so physically new. But
dialog: the spirit never grows old. And in
dialog: the domain of the Eternal Giver, Mrs
dialog: Terrain shall dwell in bountiful joy
dialog: forever.
dialog: 
text: ..... (CUT to SAM's POV) ... past SPIRO to a section in
text: the bleachers directly across from the coffin and the
text: VICAR where a WOMAN (her back to SAM) is surrounded by a
text: buzzing flock of very handsome and well-dressed YOUNG MEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (trying to take in scene)
dialog: what? ... Oh ...
text: (starts to follow Spiro)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIRO
dialog: (coming up to back of
dialog: woman)
dialog: Madam ...
text: CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It
text: is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years
text: younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Sam!!!
dialog: (uncertainty in her
dialog: expression)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
text: (staring dumbly, not
dialog: knowing what to say)
dialog: Mother? ... What ... what's ...
dialog: you've got to help me ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (embarrassed, unsure)
dialog: Not now ... please
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG GALLANT
dialog: (belligerently)
dialog: Ida, is this fellow bothering you?
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: I'll -
dialog: 
dialog: But before we can find out what he'll:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SFX:
scene_heading: TERRIFIC CRASH.
dialog: 
text: CUT to entrance to Chapel as a squad of TROOPS come
text: crashing in. PEOPLE begin to scatter, screaming. The
text: TROOPS spot SAM who dashes away from his MOTHER and heads
text: for a door behind the altar. In his panic he crashes
text: against the coffin which topples over spilling its
text: contents ... a hundredweight of offal. SAM covers his
text: mouth and dashes through the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 145 EXT. MAZE-LIKE DARK PASSAGES		 NIGHT		145
dialog: 
text: CUT to SAM, really dashing madly, tripping over things,
text: hurting himself, getting up running.
text: He is in a maze of machinery. Every way he turns his path
text: seems blocked by either TROOPS or FIGURES from his dreams.
text: The walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes
text: deeper into it. More rectangular, higher. We see a top
text: shot of the maze with SAM separate from the pursuing
text: FORCES but they are closing in on him from all sides. The
text: maze extends as far as we can see. SAM turns left and
dialog: right through it, always there is a chance of turnings.
text: Until ... he rounds a corner and for the first time there
text: is nowhere to go. The maze leads straight ahead to a dead
dialog: end.
text: At the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from
text: the consumer society. Televisions, washing machines, hair
text: dryers, junk. SAM can do nothing but try to dig through
dialog: this pile.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Maybe he can defend himself with something here. He
text: scrabbles away. Looking back he sees the massed AGENTS,
text: TROOPS, FORCES OF DARKNESS heading toward him. No escape.
text: He digs, harder, faster. Junk flies everywhere. He
text: actually reaches the end wall. Back to it, he turns to
text: face the foe. But as he moves against the wall his hand
text: touches something. A door knob. He turns. It's a door. The
text: knob turns easily. The door swings open. SAM dives through
dialog: it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 146 INT. HABITATION UNIT				NIGHT		146
dialog: 
text: SAM finds himself in a strange little house empty of
text: furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed
text: frame. He tries to lock the door behind him but there is
text: no key. He puts his weight against the door to keep it
text: shut. From outside there is the general noise of pursuit
text: but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet
text: uniform engine-sound. SAM lets go of the door carefully.
text: He looks around but there is only one window and it is
text: shuttered. He carefully opens the door a crack and he sees-
dialog: 
text: SAM'S POV: A rapidly receding street.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 147 EXT. CITY						NIGHT		147
dialog: 
text: JILL's truck, with the house on its back, is driving
text: dangerously through he streets. It lurches round the
dialog: corner.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 148 INT. HABITATION UNIT				NIGHT		148
dialog: 
text: - The lurch throws SAM to one side. He picks himself up,
text: and, fighting the centrifugal force, works his way to the
text: shuttered window which is at the front end of the house,
text: in the wall opposite the door. SAM undoes the shutters and
text: finds himself looking at the rear window of JILL's cab. He
text: sees the back of the DRIVER's head. The DRIVER is wearing
text: JILL's cap. He sees the back of the DRIVER's cab. He bangs
text: on the glass of the cab. The DRIVER raises her head so
text: that the face is visible to SAM in the driving mirror. He
text: sees that it is JILL, in a flat cap. She smiles at him.
text: SAM sobs with relief and love.

scene_heading: 149 EXT. THE ROAD					 NIGHT		149

scene_heading: 150 INT. TRAVELLING LORRY			 NIGHT		150

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 151 EXT. SMALL ROAD					EARLY MORNING 151
dialog: 
text: The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches and then

text: BEAUTIFUL UNTOUCHED VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a
dialog: MIX ...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 152 EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY			 DAY		 152
dialog: 
text: Half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with
text: the house on its back. Creepers and wild roses have grown
text: up over the truck and some of the house. A curl of smoke
text: rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to
text: one of the walls. A small piece of ground around the truck
text: has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a
text: vegetable plat. There is also a pretty cow, and some
text: chickens. JILL appears locking like CRUSOE carrying a
text: basket of eggs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 153 INT. HOUSE						MORNING	 153
dialog: 
text: SAM is in the bed, just waking up. He opens his eyes,
text: locking calm. Off screen we hear the door opening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL (off screen)
dialog: Morning. Sleep well?
dialog: 
text: SAM nods his head slightly, on the pillow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I don't dream anymore.

scene_heading: 154 EXT. HOUSE AND GARDEN			 MORNING	 154
dialog: 
text: A high shot. Everything in the garden is definitely
text: lovely. The music tells us. The music swells and the
text: camera slowly pulls back, and back. It's a happy ending.
text: And then, in the foreground, TWO HUGE HEADS appear looking
text: straight at the camera. It is MR HELPMANN and JACK. They
text: both shake their heads.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR HELPMANN
dialog: He's got away from us, Jack.
dialog: 
text: CUT to their POV.

scene_heading: 155 INT. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM	 DAY		 155
dialog: 
text: Sam is sitting in the IR chair. He is strapped in. His

text: benign and very happy smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm afraid you're right, Mr.
text: Helpmann. He's gone.
dialog: 
text: A wide shot of the room shows us HELPMANN and LINT turn
text: away and leave. SAM is left alone. He is humming.. The
text: camera pulls back and back. The Information Retrieval room
text: with SAM in it floats away into the most beautiful
dialog: glorious sky ever.
dialog: 
text: SAM's humming into a full orchestra, and we hear ......
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: "Brazil, where hearts were entertained in June,
text: We stood beneath an amber moon,
dialog: And softly murmured 'Some day soon'
dialog: We kissed and clung together,
dialog: Then, tomorrow was another day.
dialog: The morning found me miles away,
dialog: With still a million things to say,
text: Now, when twilight beams the sky above,
dialog: Recalling thrills of our love,
dialog: There's one thing I'm certain of,
dialog: Return, I will,
dialog: To old Brazil."
