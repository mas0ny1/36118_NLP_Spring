speaker_heading: ACT ONE:
text: FRONT TITLES: The front title sequence is over a STOCK FOOTAGE montage of the

scene_heading: EXT. “STUDENTS FOR POLITICAL ACTION” OFFICE — DAY
text: The “Students For Political Action” office is a small storefront located in a downtown
text: area. Poor, inner-city people fill the streets. A 21-year old beatnik boy named MAX,
text: with a goatee and a beret, steps up to the front door, pulls out a key, goes to insert it
text: into the lock and the door swings open. Max finds this somewhat surprising and enters.
scene_heading: INT. “STUDENTS FOR POLITICAL ACTION” OFFICE — DAY
text: Max steps into the ratty interior of the office—old and broken office furniture, torn easy
text: chairs with stuffing hanging out, a torn, yellowing poster on the wall announcing The
text: Weavers reunion concert at Carnagie Hall—and he finds the air full of cigarette smoke,
text: which he waves away from his face. Max turns on the light.
text: In the very back of the office is LORRAINE DEMPSEY, an attractive, intense 19-year
text: old girl with a short, boyish haircut, wearing a plaid skirt and a sweater. She cranks a
text: mimeograph machine which on each revolution spits out a yellow flyer stating in big
text: bold letters, “Free the Springfield Five!! Emergency Meeting Sunday at 8:00 P.M.”
text: Lorraine sees Max and blinks, a smoldering cigarette butt dangling from her lips.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Lorraine, you're still here? That’s exactly where |
dialog: left you last night.
text: Lorraine squints through the smoke wafting up into her eyes.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: I’m ready, Max. Nothing can stop me now.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: You need to go to sleep.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (waves her hand)
dialog: Nah! | slept all the time when | was young.
dialog: (points)
dialog: I’ve made 500 flyers, you think that’s enough?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: | should think so.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: And you'll help me hand them out?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's why I’m here.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Good. Y’know, Max, as I’ve stood here all night
dialog: cranking this machine, it came to me that we’re
text: standing at a crossroads.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: A crossroads to what?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: To anew age.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: That's what they were all saying about Kennedy
dialog: and Camelot and all that, but look what happened.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: It's bigger than that.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah, | think you’ve been up too long.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Hopefully, it will be a time when stuff like this . . .
dialog: (waves flyers)
dialog: . .. won't happen anymore. | mean, if we don’t do
dialog: something right away these five boys will spend the
text: rest of their young lives in jail.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Hey, you don’t have to convince me. But their pre-trial
dialog: hearing is Monday. If they go in there with some cracker,
dialog: redneck, court-appointed attorney, they'll get life for sure.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: | know! This could well be their last chance. That’s
dialog: why it’s so important and that’s why I’m so nervous.
dialog: This is the first important political action that I’ve
dialog: personally organized. People just have to show up.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I'll be there.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: | mean, real people?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Gosh, thanks a lot.
dialog: (Lorraine smiles)
dialog: Look, it’s an important cause, why wouldn’t they
dialog: show up?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Um... to make me look bad?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Make you look bad to whom, if | may ask?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Myself.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Is that what this is all about, Lorraine? Looking good?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: No, not at all. It’s entirely about those five boys and
dialog: the injustice that’s being done to them. | mean, if |
dialog: don’t do something about it why should | expect
dialog: anyone else to do anything, right?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: We all have to draw a line somewhere and say, “If you
dialog: go beyond that line you have to deal with me, too.” At
dialog: least, that’s what | think.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Right. Me, too. You could always just tackle people
text: out in the street and drag ‘em in kicking and screaming.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: | might yet.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: | bet you would, too. But why do you do this,
dialog: Lorraine, staying up all night, burning it at both ends?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Someone’s got to, right?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Do they? Why?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Because if nobody cares the whole world will go to
dialog: hell.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But, Lorraine, you can’t save the whole world.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: No, but | can try. And step one is getting everyone
dialog: to care about this issue, the Springfield Five.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But you can’t actually make anyone else care about
dialog: something, Lorraine. Not really.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Oh, sure you can. These are old, time-worn techniques
dialog: used by the wobblies before the war. But getting to
dialog: a whole group at once, that’s the trick. That's where
dialog: songs come in.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Yeah, but even songs won’t make someone care
dialog: if they don't.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: If it's the right song being sung the right way.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: | don’t think that’s true.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (off-handed)
dialog: Sure it is. Deep down | honestly think that people
dialog: really want to do what's right and actually do care,
dialog: they just need a little push in the right direction to get
dialog: them going, and that’s where | come in.
text: Lorraine reaches into her sweater pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes, which she
text: finds empty and crumples.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Gotta smoke?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: No. You're an idealist, Lorraine.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: I'm more than idealist, Max, I’m an instrument of
dialog: God.
text: Lorraine checks out the overflowing ashtray and spots a long butt. She straightens it
text: out and lights it, then takes a sip of coffee. She winces and sticks out her tongue.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Blah! How can coffee get colder than the room
dialog: it’s in?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: | don’t know. You going to the Purple Onion tonight?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Oh yeah, sure. Got to.
text: (she waves a pile of flyers)
dialog: | have to get every single person at the Purple Onion
dialog: tonight to come to my meeting Sunday. Those people
dialog: are what | have to work with; they're my building
dialog: materials and this meeting is my testing ground. If
dialog: | have to yell and scream, I'll do it. If | have to
dialog: whisper and sing songs, I'll do that.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: And you dig it.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Yeah, yeah, that, too.
dialog: (snaps her fingers)
dialog: That reminds me, have you got an extra guitar
dialog: pick?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Not here. You can always use a matchbook.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: They shred. That’s OK, I'll swing by the music
dialog: store.
text: Lorraine sits down and puts on her shoes. Max checks out her legs as she does this.
dialog: Suddenly...
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Lorraine, you drive me crazy! Why won't you
dialog: go out with me?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Look, Max, you’re my friend. Let’s leave it at
dialog: that, OK?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: But | don’t want to leave it at that.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: If there was something here, Max, we’d know about
dialog: it by now, right?
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: ! know about it.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (shrugs)
text: It takes two to tango.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: But what can | do, Lorraine?
text: Lorraine smiles and hands Max a thick pile of flyers.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Here. Hand these out. See ya later, alligator.
text: Lorraine walks out of the office and Max watches her go, groaning audibly after she’s
dialog: left.
scene_heading: EXT. “STUDENTS FOR POLITICAL ACTION” OFFICE — DAY
text: Lorraine exits the office and strides up the street immediately attempting to hand out
text: flyers.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Demand justice now! Free the Springfield Five!
text: Most people take the flyers that are offered to them, although many immediately
text: discard them, some right on the street. When Lorraine sees this she goes over and
text: picks the flyer back up.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Slob!
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: EXT. THE BUCKLEY HOUSE — DAY
dialog: 8
text: This is a small house in a neighborhood of nearly identical homes. Big leafy trees line
text: the shady street. A red 1960 Ford Falcon sits in the driveway. The distinctive sound of
text: the Three Stooges playing on TV can be heard from within. A car pulls up in front of
dialog: the house.
scene_heading: INT. THE BUCKLEY HOUSE/LIVING ROOM — DAY
text: DAN BUCKLEY, a 14-year old wearing a Boy Scout uniform, sits watching the Three
text: Stooges on TV and laughing. The doorbell rings. Dan dashes over and opens the
text: door. Two other 14-year old boys in Boy Scout uniforms come bursting in and they all
text: begin talking at once. Dan and his pals leave.
text: MR. BUCKLEY and MRS. BUCKLEY enter the living room. Phil’s Dad is wearing a
text: bowling shirt and holds a bowling ball up in front of his face.
scene_heading: MRS. BUCKLEY
dialog: Be careful with that in the house.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: Hon, please, I’ve got to get in the proper frame
dialog: of mind, OK?
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: Get it, “frame” of mind? Bowling. Frame
scene_heading: MRS. BUCKLEY
dialog: That's great, dear, you’re another Red Skelton.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
text: (imitates Red Skelton’s lisp)
dialog: Good night and God blesh.
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Where's Phil?
scene_heading: MRS. BUCKLEY
dialog: (shakes her head)
text: Still in bed.
text: Mr. Buckley looks at his watch and frowns.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: It’s after ten, what’s with him?
scene_heading: MRS. BUCKLEY
dialog: You tell me. Ever since he graduated high school
dialog: and started work, he’s changed. He just doesn’t
dialog: seem to give a damn about anything anymore. |
dialog: don’t know what to do with him.
text: Mr. Buckley considers this for a moment, then exits the living room.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PHIL’S ROOM — DAY
text: Phil’s Dad steps up to a closed bedroom door, tries the doorknob and finds it locked.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: Phil? You up?
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: Aren't you supposed to be at work?
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: | got the day off.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: It just happens that way sometimes.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: Huh. Well, why don’t you get out of bed.
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: Why? What's the difference?
text: Mrs. Buckley steps up beside her husband.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: Because it’s a beautiful day.
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: It's a beautiful day here in my bed, too.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: | don’t like this behavior, Phil.
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: 10
dialog: Yeah?
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: Yeah. So get your ass out of bed!
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, yeah, | will.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: Do it soon.
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: All right. OK.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Y’know, Phil, if you waste this day, you'll never
dialog: get it back.
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah? Big deal.
scene_heading: MRS. BUCKLEY
dialog: (to her husband)
dialog: You see?
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: Yeah, | see.
scene_heading: MRS. BUCKLEY
dialog: What can we do?
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: How the hell am | supposed to know?
dialog: (he kisses his wife)
dialog: | gotta go. See ya.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BUCKLEY
dialog: Bye.
text: Phil’s Dad and Mom exit and we stay on Phil’s closed bedroom door.
scene_heading: INT. PHIL’S BEDROOM - DAY
text: PHIL BUCKLEY, a tall, handsome, eighteen-year old boy with a crewcut, lies in bed in
dialog: 11
text: his boxer shorts smoking a cigarette. Phil wears a can opener on a shoelace around
text: his neck. The ashtray beside his bed is overflowing with smashed butts. Phil smokes
text: languidly, the smoke drifting up from his nose. There are ashes on his chest, but he
text: doesn’t notice.
text: Phil reaches under the bed and comes out with a can of beer. He opens it with his can
text: opener, guzzles, winces, grins and belches.
text: Phil glances over at the wall beside him. There are many photos of Elvis cut from
text: magazines, as well as pictures of Tuesday Weld, Chuck Berry, Bobby Darin and Mickey
text: Mantle. Phil suddenly sits up, reaches over and grabs an acoustic guitar that’s leaning
text: against the wall and begins strumming it.
text: Phil plays a variety of tunes and rhythms in a half-assed fashion, but nothing sounds
text: very good. He glances over at a book on his desk, “Beginning Guitar.” Phil opens the
text: book and begins to play. He’s doing OK until he attempts to make a specific chord and,
text: sadly, his fingers don’t want to stretch that way.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Ouch!
text: Phil shuts the book. He walks over to his dresser, steps in front of the mirror, crosses
text: his arms, lowers his chin and proceeds to do a poor Ed Sullivan imitation.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Tonight we have a really big shew. | mean,
dialog: a really, really big shew. Let's all give a very
dialog: warm welcome to the talented, amazing, one-
dialog: of-a-kind Phil Buckley!
text: (he imitates the fans cheering;
text: smiling humbly he picks up his
text: guitar and imitates Elvis)
dialog: Thank you. Thank you very much. I'd like
dialog: to play my newest song which has been
dialog: (continued)
speaker_heading: PHIL (cont.)
dialog: number-one on the hit parade for over three
dialog: months...
text: Phil sits down on the bed, strums his guitar, but still isn’t getting the sound he wants.
text: He thinks for a second, then puts down the guitar and digs through one of his dresser
text: drawers. He comes up with a cheap old microphone with a strange, multi-pronged plug
text: on the end. Phil considers this situation for a moment, then produces a Boy Scout knife
text: and deftly cuts off the plug. He then splits the wire and shaves off the insulation.
dialog: 12
text: Phil takes the mike over to his record player and connects the bare wires to the back of
text: the amplifier. Suddenly, feedback fills the room. Phil’s eyes light up.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Boss!
text: He moves the mike away from the amp, then blows into it and hears his amplified
text: breath through his speakers. Phil takes the microphone and shoves it into the hole of
text: his guitar and presto! It’s electric! Now he really starts to rock and it’s clear that Phil is
text: not particularly talented, simply enthusiastic. He does the Chuck Berry duck-walk
text: across his room, guitar wailing.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN — DAY
text: Phil’s Mom is doing the dishes. She hears the strange, electronic noise and looks all
dialog: around.
scene_heading: MRS. BUCKLEY
dialog: What on Earth?
scene_heading: INT. PHIL’S BEDROOM — DAY
dialog: Phil’s a rock & roll maniac playing to thousands of adoring fans and everything's terrific
text: until — sproing! — one of his guitar strings breaks. Phil frowns, setting down his guitar.
text: He scrutinizes the money on his dresser — he has one dollar to his name.
text: Nevertheless, a guitar with a broken string seems like a fairly useless item. Phil stands
text: up, finally motivated to do something. He puts his guitar in it’s battered old case and
text: begins putting on his clothes.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS — DAY
text: Phil walks along the street carrying his guitar case. Phil isn’t paying any attention to
text: anything going on around him. He’s got a tune in his head and a vague, amused look
text: on his face. He occasionally makes an Elvis Presley-style hip gyration accompanied by
text: a grunt and we realize that Phil’s still on The Ed Sullivan Show in his head. He adds
text: the crowd reaction sounds, cheering and laughing.
text: The beatnik kid MAX from the “Students for Political Action” office offers Phil a flyer.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Free the Springfield Five! Let justice be done,
dialog: 13
text: man. Meeting on Sunday at the Purple Onion.
text: Phil waves it away entirely uninterested.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No thanks.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC STORE — DAY
text: This is the all-purpose variety of music store that sells most every sort of instrument and
text: all the accessories. Lorraine stands before a large variety of guitar picks holding her
text: guitar and deliberates. She chooses a pick, checks its thickness, then drops it back in
text: its bin. Finally, Lorraine makes her decision, chooses a pick, then steps over to the
text: counter and pays the portly, middle-aged CLERK a quarter.
text: Lorraine strolls over to the sheet music. She flips through until she finds something she
text: likes and pulls it out—it’s Woody Guthrie’s song “This Land is Your Land.” Lorraine
text: plays the first several chords, humming the tune. Something else catches her attention
text: and she walks to another part of the store, stepping behind a big display case filled with
text: woodwind instruments.
text: Just then Phil steps up in front of the woodwind case, then crosses to the acoustic
text: guitar section where Lorraine just stood. He finds the guitar string he needs and it costs
text: fifty cents, half of his accumulated wealth. Phil resigns himself to this inevitability and
text: replaces his broken string. He sees the portly Clerk watching him and smiles at the
text: guy. The Clerk smiles back.
text: Lorraine hands a yellow flyer to an OLD BLACK WOMAN, who puts on her glasses and
text: looks at it with interest.
text: Now Phil attempts to tune his guitar. He does a rather half-assed job, shrugs—that’s
text: good enough—then spots the open sheet music in front of him of “This Land is Your
text: Land.” Phil concentrates deeply, furrowing his brow, and painfully strums and sings the
text: first few chords of the song.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (singing)
dialog: This land is your land
dialog: This land is my land
dialog: From California
dialog: To the New York Island
dialog: From the redwood forests
dialog: To the Gulf stream waters
dialog: This land was made for you and me—
dialog: 14
text: Lorraine steps up from behind and proclaims. . .
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: I love this song!
text: Phil turns around and checks Lorraine out. He smiles his coolest smile.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Really? No kidding? Me, too.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Really? Come on, let’s play it together.
text: Lorraine begins playing the song and Phil very hesitantly follows along, glancing
text: frequently at the lyrics.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE & PHIL
dialog: (singing)
dialog: As | went walking
dialog: That ribbon of highway
dialog: | saw above me
dialog: That endless skyway
dialog: | saw below me
dialog: That golden valley
dialog: This land was made for you and me
dialog: (continued)
speaker_heading: LORRAINE & PHIL (cont.)
dialog: This land is your land
dialog: This land is my land
dialog: From California
dialog: To the New York Island
dialog: From the redwood forests
dialog: To the Gulf stream waters
dialog: This land was made for you and me
dialog: | roamed and rambled
dialog: And | followed my footsteps
dialog: To the sparkling sands
dialog: Of her diamond deserts
dialog: While all around me
dialog: 15
text: A voice was sounding, sayin’,
dialog: This land was made for you and me
text: The sun came shining
dialog: And | was strolling
dialog: And the wheat fields waving
text: And the dust clouds rolling
dialog: As the fog was lifting
text: A voice was chanting
dialog: This land was made for you and me
text: Suddenly, everybody in the store, including the old black woman and the clerk, joins in
dialog: for the finale.
speaker_heading: EVERYBODY
dialog: This land is your land
dialog: This land is my land
dialog: From California
dialog: To the New York Island
dialog: From the redwood forests
dialog: To the Gulf stream waters
dialog: This land was made for you and me
dialog: This land was made for you and me
text: Everybody laughs, then returns to their business. Lorraine turns to Phil.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Wow! Did you see the way the music draws
dialog: people in? It’s fantastic.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah, it sure is. So, you like music, eh?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Yes, very much. Do you?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh, yeah. Uh, my name’s Phil, what’s yours?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Lorraine.
text: (he puts out his hand to shake
text: and she hands him a yellow flyer)
dialog: There’s a really important meeting tomorrow
text: night for the Springfield Five.
dialog: 16
text: Phil takes the flyer looking confused.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Is that a new band?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: No! Don’t you read the newspaper?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sure, but | must've missed it.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: It's been the headline for the last week.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: The neighbor’s dog grabs our paper all the time
text: and chews it up. What’s going on?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: The Springfield Five are five colored boys that were
text: arrested for no good reason as they were driving
dialog: down south to a civil rights rally. We're trying to
dialog: get them out of jail.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh. OK. Tomorrow night, huh?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
text: At 8:00.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (frowns)
dialog: But tomorrow's Sunday, y’know.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Yeah? So?
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: So, Ed Sullivan’s on Sunday at eight.
text: Lorraine grimaces with disdain.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: 17
dialog: Oh, that’s too bad. I’m talking about real
dialog: problems in the real world here.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: | know, I’m just telling you that that’s not a good
dialog: time for a meeting.
text: Lorraine looks stricken.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: You think? | printed 500 flyers.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: It may not mean anything, y'know, maybe he
dialog: hasn’t got anyone good on the show this week.
text: Lorraine suddenly looks like she’s got a headache. She reaches into her sweater
text: pocket and finds it empty.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Have you got a cigarette?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sure. Wanna get a cup of coffee to go with it?
text: Lorraine looks him up and down.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (grins)
dialog: OK. Caffeine and nicotine are my favorite food
dialog: groups.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Don’t forget beer, it’s just like liquid bread.
text: Lorraine laughs and she and Phil exit.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE HOUSE — DAY
text: Phil and Lorraine both drink mugs of coffee and smoke cigarettes.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Well, | worked for a while at a crisis phone line,
dialog: 18
dialog: but | got really tired sitting up all night listening
text: to drug addicts moan about not scoring and
dialog: pretending to be a marriage counselor. | didn’t
dialog: really feel like | was part of the fight.
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: (Phil nods, mesmerized)
dialog: Right.
text: Lorraine really looks at Phil.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Do you know what | mean?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: No, not really.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Haven't you ever had a feeling of pure empathy?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (thinks, then shakes
dialog: his head)
dialog: I'm not sure. What's empathy?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: It’s like sympathy, only you don’t feel bad for
dialog: someone, you feel bad with them.
dialog: (Phil digests this)
dialog: Haven't you ever felt that way?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh, yeah. “Lassie” does that to me almost every
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: TV again! Jesus!
dialog: 19
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You don’t like TV?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: No, | don’t. | think it makes people apathetic.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: It’s just entertainment.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: And some entertainment has value. But mindless
dialog: entertainment is useless. What are some of your
dialog: interests?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Me? Oh, well, | have a wide range of interests.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Really? Like what?
text: Phil suddenly feels cornered.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, like everything.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Everything, huh? Interested in paleontology?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Do you know very much about paleontology?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (grins)
dialog: I’m the foremost authority.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: 20
dialog: OK. So, what's your favorite subject?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You mean like in school?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: No, | mean like in life.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh, that. Well...uh... music, | guess.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: You sure don’t sound convinced.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No, | am. Music. Definitely. | wanna be a
dialog: musician.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: You know, it’s really hard to be a musician.
dialog: | take guitar lessons twice a week and that’s
dialog: not nearly enough.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Well... It all depends on what you're after,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, that’s if you want to be, say, a good or
dialog: great musician.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: 21
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, Bobby Darin doesn’t really have a great
dialog: voice, but he’s a very successful singer. Or what
dialog: about Bob Dylan? He can’t sing at all.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Yeah, but he’s a great song writer.
text: Phil waves his hand in total deprecation.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You can hire guys to do that.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Yeah, so...?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: So, you don’t necessarily have to be good to
dialog: be famous. Look at Dean Martin.
text: Lorraine consider this for a second, then dismisses the whole thing.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: That's silly. Of course you do. What are you
dialog: talking about? If it’s not their musical ability then
dialog: it’s their presentation. It’s gotta be something.
dialog: (Phil nods, good point;
dialog: Lorraine remembers)
dialog: Oh, y’know, tonight’s Hootenanny night at
dialog: the Purple Onion, you have to come.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Hootenanny? Is that like when you square-
dialog: dance and stuff?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No. Hootenanny night means that it’s open
dialog: microphone for anyone that wants to get up
dialog: and sing or play or read a poem or do anything.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: 22
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Will you be there?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (smiles and nods)
dialog: Yes, | will. I’m going to sing a song tonight.
dialog: You really should come, | mean, if you actually
dialog: want to be a musician and all.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Right. | do. And | will.
text: Lorraine suddenly stands.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: I’ve gotta go. So, will | see you tonight at the
dialog: Purple Onion?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sure. Absolutely.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Great. Will you sing a song?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Do | have to?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: No, you don’t have to do anything you don’t
dialog: want to do. None of these people are professionals,
dialog: it’s just a hootenanny. But let’s face it, Phil, if you
dialog: can’t sing at a hootenanny you'll never be famous
dialog: as a musician.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: OK. See ya there if you’re there.
dialog: 23
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I'll be there. Nice meeting you.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: You, too.
text: Lorraine departs. The Waitress steps up and hands Phil the bill, which is 42 cents. He
dialog: leaves his entire 49 cents.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (smooth)
dialog: Keep the change, sweetheart.
text: The WAITRESS snorts and Phil leaves.

text: Lorraine stands in front of the office handing out yellow flyers and demanding Justice!
text: A big, green 1963 Cadillac Sedan devVille with very pointy fins pulls up in front of her

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: So, did you get an early start on solving the world’s
dialog: problems today?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: As a matter of fact, | did. | think I'll be having a very
dialog: big meeting Sunday night.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: | hope you do. But honestly, Lorraine, do you really
text: think a bunch of college kids meeting in a low-rent
dialog: downtown office are going to get those five Negro boys
dialog: set free?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: I certainly hope so. If nothing else it will raise people’s

dialog: somewhere.
text: Mom turns to Dad.
speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Unmitigated decadence, and the food’s not very
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You were such a happy little girl, Lorraine. What
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: | developed a social conscience.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well it certainly hasn’t made you any happier, | can
dialog: tell you that. Why don’t you go away to Europe
dialog: for a while — say a year — and make up your mind
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: | live here in America, mom. The problems of
dialog: America are my problems. And my mind is made
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Your mom’s not kidding, Lorraine. You want to go

dialog: word.
dialog: 
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Oh, Dad, please.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You were accepted to the University of Florence,

dialog: there a few years ago. You ran around the house
dialog: talking Italian for months.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (sighs wearily)
dialog: This is such a bore.
text: Lorraine’s Mom and Dad look at each other and shake their heads.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: So, Lorraine, how many people are you expecting
dialog: at this rally of yours?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: | don’t know. About a hundred, I’d say.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, how many chairs did you rent?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
text: Fifty, but there’s twenty or thirty chairs there and
dialog: | figure some people can stand.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: How’re you getting the rented chairs there?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Dad, please, I'll work it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Look, you want to be an organizer and organizers
dialog: bring in the people. If they don’t bring in a decent
dialog: crowd, you'll have to admit, they’re not worth much
dialog: as an organizer, right?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (begrudgingly)
dialog: 27
dialog: Yeah, | suppose.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: OK, how about this? If less than fifty people show
dialog: up to your meeting, you consider doing something
dialog: else. Anything else. More than fifty and I’ll shut up,
dialog: for awhile. What do you say? But you have to give
dialog: me a fair count.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: All | did was agree to go to lunch, I’m not here to

speaker_heading: DAD

dialog: Well, | like playing the guitar.
scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (serious)
dialog: Hey! People can be serious about things in their

scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah? Well...

scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY
dialog: Maybe you should become a folkie, then you’d
dialog: be committed to all kinds of things, too.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I’ve been thinking about it.

speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Please come to this meeting tomorrow, it’s
dialog: really important. See what you can do, OK?

dialog: No, no, it’s a great Peter, Paul & Mary song.

text: It's a Weavers song. Peter, Paul & Mary re-did
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (not listening)
dialog: Yeah, right, the Wheelers. They're great, too.
text: Just then a slouchy fellow named TERRY, with thick, black-rimmed glasses, and rather

speaker_heading: TERRY

text: leads him inside.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Let’s get you signed up so you don’t miss your

dialog: Phil Buckley.
dialog: M.C.
dialog: OK, Phil there you go.
text: The M.C. writes “Phil” at the bottom of the Hootenanny list, a blackboard with ten acts
text: listed above him. Phil gulps, thinking what have | done? The M.C. tells Phil:
dialog: M.C.
dialog: Keep in mind, though, friend, that with ten acts
dialog: ahead of you there’s a pretty good chance you
dialog: won't get to go on at all.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (mumbles to himself)
dialog: God willing.
dialog: 41
speaker_heading: LORRAINE

speaker_heading: LORRAINE

dialog: Later.

speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (excited)
dialog: I’m so glad Terry made it, | really think you two will
dialog: hit it off. He’s really smart. | met him at a sit-in,

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What cause?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: The cause of freedom and equality.
dialog: 42
speaker_heading: PHIL

dialog: Oh. Right. That.
dialog: (casually)
dialog: By the way, what are some of your favorite folk
dialog: songs?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Well, | really like Bob Dylan’s “Talking Word War 3
dialog: Blues.”
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (shakes his head; sighs)
dialog: | don’t know that one.
text: The guitar is starting to feel like 500 pound weight to Phil.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Bring your guitar tomorrow night to the meeting
dialog: and we can have our own little hootenanny after-
dialog: ward. |’ll teach it to you.
text: That sounds like a fine idea to Phil, who nods and grins.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Boss.
text: As they cross the room, Lorraine waves and says hi to just about everybody and they all
text: wave and say hi back to her. Phil’s impressed.
text: They arrive at the table down near the stage where Terry, Alvin & Debbie are sitting
text: drinking a pitcher of beer and are all smoking cigarettes. Lorraine sits beside Terry.
text: Phil quickly sits on her other side.
text: Lorraine leans across the table to speak and whispers with Debbie. Debbie points at

dialog: From you, perhaps?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (considers; looks at Phil)
dialog: ... Perhaps.
text: Phil and Terry look at each other past Lorraine’s shapely rump.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (to Phil)
dialog: What song are you singing?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I’m still thinking about it. What are some your
dialog: favorite folk songs?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: | don’t like folk songs.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Then what are you doing here?
text: Terry glances at Lorraine’s derriere, then up to Phil. Phil grins and shrugs, indicating
text: that he too is there for the same reason.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You a student?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Uh, no. I’m gonna start at SCC in the fall.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Harvard of the highway. It’s like high school with
dialog: ashtrays. | went for a year. Workin’?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: 44
dialog: Ata shoe store. You?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: | work on the college newspaper.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (nods; impressed)
dialog: Your parents rich?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No, not really.
dialog: (whispers and points)
dialog: But Lorraine’s sure are.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (interested)
dialog: Really? But she seems so...
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: . .. Down to Earth?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah. Right.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It’s the rejection of the money. Very common.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (fascinated)
dialog: It is?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Sure, take a look around you. What do you
dialog: see?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: People. Folkies.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Middle-class to upper-middle-class white people,
text: with just a few token Negroes thrown in for color,
dialog: whose own self-hatred causes them to have to
dialog: pretend to help other people less fortunate than
dialog: themselves to ease their guilt.
dialog: 45
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Huh.
text: Across the table, Alvin & Debbie are having a discussion.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: So, when will you start looking for a new job?
dialog: You said after the New Year, well it’s February.
speaker_heading: ALVIN
dialog: But, Deb, | like my job.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You like your job? Come on.
speaker_heading: ALVIN
dialog: All right, | don’t hate my job. I’ve had plenty of
dialog: jobs I’ve hated, too. And then | don’t like waking
text: up in the morning.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: But Alvin, dear, you don’t make enough money.
dialog: We're going to need more money soon. We might
dialog: even have to buy a house.
speaker_heading: ALVIN
dialog: (holds up his hands)
dialog: Whoa! Slow down, will you. I’m not ready for
dialog: any of this.
text: Debbie points at her protruding belly.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Too late.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Hey! Come on you guys, you're out in public,
dialog: remember.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: There are times when his complacency makes me
dialog: want to kill him.
dialog: 46
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: But you've decided to have his child instead.
text: Terry and Phil continue to talk.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: So, you’re up at State?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: So, what are you taking up?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Time and space.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (grins)
dialog: I’m doin’ that right here, why go to State?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Less parental supervision. More parties. More
text: chicks.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: But don’t they make you take tests occasionally?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Occasionally, but school’s easy if you know how
dialog: to do it.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: So what are really studying?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Computers.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Computers, huh? You really are into weird stuff.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Computers aren’t so weird. Someday there'll be
dialog: 47
text: hundreds of them, everywhere.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Sure, if you say so.
text: Lorraine sits back down between Phil and Terry.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: You boys getting acquainted?
text: Both grunt in the affirmative.
text: The bearded M.C. steps up onto the small stage and speaks into the microphone.
dialog: M.C.
dialog: I'd like to welcome everybody to the Purple
dialog: Onion’s weekly Hootenanny night. This is
dialog: the night when we get a preview of the up-
dialog: coming folk stars of the future. I’d also like
dialog: to announce a very important meeting to be
dialog: held here tomorrow night to help arrange a
dialog: defense fund for the Springfield Five.
dialog: (Lorraine looks around
dialog: and smiles)
dialog: If you really care about the cause of freedom
dialog: you'll make sure to be here. OK. Now let’s
dialog: have some fun. Our first act of the evening
dialog: is the husband and wife duo, Alvin & Debbie.
dialog: Let’s give them a warm Purple Onion welcome.
text: The audience applauds as Alvin & Debbie step up on stage.
speaker_heading: ALVIN
dialog: Thank you very much. But don’t get Debbie too
dialog: excited, she might have the baby right here.
text: Debbie elbows him the ribs and the audience chuckles. They launch into a highly
text: energetic rendition of “Rock Island Line”
speaker_heading: ALVIN & DEBBIE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Well the Rock Island Line
dialog: 48
dialog: Is a mighty good road
dialog: Oh the Rock Island Line
dialog: It is the road to ride
dialog: The Rock Island Line
dialog: Is a mighty good road
dialog: But if ya want to ride
dialog: Ya gotta ride it like ya find it
dialog: Get your ticket at the station
dialog: For the Rock Island Line
dialog: Well | may be right
dialog: And | may be wrong
dialog: | know you’re gonna miss me
dialog: When I’m gone
text: Underneath the table, Phil edges his foot over until it's beside Lorraine’s foot. Phil
text: moves his foot the next inch so that his foot is now touching Lorraine’s foot. He glances
text: over and she gives no sign of anything other than being mesmerized by the singing.
speaker_heading: ALVIN & DEBBIE
dialog: Well the Rock Island Line
dialog: Is a mighty good road
dialog: Oh the Rock Island Line
dialog: It is the road to ride
dialog: The Rock Island Line
dialog: Is a mighty good road
dialog: But if ya want to ride
dialog: Ya gotta ride it like ya find it
dialog: Get your ticket at the station
dialog: For the Rock Island Line
dialog: Little Emmalina
text: Sittin’ in the shade
dialog: Countin’ all the money
dialog: That we ain’t made
text: Terry moves his foot until it’s touching Lorraine’s other foot. We see Lorraine note the
text: situation, then throw a glance at both boys. They both smile innocently.
speaker_heading: ALVIN & DEBBIE
dialog: Well the Rock Island Line
dialog: Is a mighty good road
dialog: Oh the Rock Island Line
dialog: 49
dialog: It is the road to ride
dialog: The Rock Island Line
dialog: Is a mighty good road
dialog: But if ya want to ride
dialog: Ya gotta ride it like ya find it
dialog: Get your ticket at the station
dialog: For the Rock Island Line
text: The audience has enjoyed this very much and claps loudly and stomps their feet.
text: Grinning, Alvin & Debbie return to their seats. Lorraine puts her arms around both of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: You see, those endless hours of practicing pay off.
speaker_heading: ALVIN
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: They sure do.
text: Phil looks like he’s in pain. Debbie grabs the pitcher of beer.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: | need a drink. Who needs refills?
text: Everyone holds up their mug.
text: Terry turns to Phil looking somewhat impressed.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That was pretty good.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: So, uh, you a big folk music fan?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: No, not really. Folk music’s OK.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What kind of music do you like?
text: Phil looks around to see if anyone is listening.
dialog: 50
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (lowers his voice)
dialog: | like rock & roll.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Me, too. Like what?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: | like Elvis.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Yeah. He’s boss. And Chuck Berry.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah.
text: Lorraine returns to her seat between Phil and Terry.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: What are you boys talking about.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Rock & roll music.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (waves it away)
dialog: That's for children.
dialog: (points at the stage)
dialog: Now that was music! Bebop-a-lula? Tutti fruitti,
dialog: oh Rudy? Come on, boys, grow up.
text: Phil and Terry both feel chastised. Lorraine sees someone she knows and moves off.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Excuse me a sec, I’ve got work to do.
text: Lorraine picks up a pile of her flyers and heads off.
text: Lorraine cruises around the club handing out flyers. Yellow flyers are set down on the
text: table and quickly used as coasters, folded and put into pockets, phone numbers are
text: written on them, corners torn off, one gets folded up and put under the short leg of a
dialog: table.
dialog: 51
text: A yellow flyer comes down revealing four middle-aged people, three men in suits and
text: ties and a woman in a dressy dress, all looking at the flyers and guzzling a pitcher of
text: beer. They are: PETE, LEE, FRED and the woman is RONNIE. Collectively they are
text: the FOUR FEATHERS. They all drink heartily and wave around the flyers.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: It looks good. How's it going?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Good. We ought to have a lot of people. But |
dialog: still need you guys to be there.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Need? Oh, come on, Lorraine, you can handle
dialog: this. I’m sure you've got everything completely
text: under control.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Well, yeah, | do, but still. . .
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Well, don’t depend on me being there. You've
dialog: got to finally handle things on your own.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: | know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: | remember the first meeting | organized. It was a
text: garment-workers strike just after the war. Somewhere
dialog: in Upstate New York.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Gloversville.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: That's right, Gloversville. Lordy, they almost tore
text: the house down.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Those were the days.
text: The Four Feathers all toast and drink.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: 52
dialog: Good luck, tonight, you guys.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Thanks, you, too. And | just know your meeting
dialog: will be great.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Lorraine walks away.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Shit! She’s not gonna be there. | was depending
text: on her.
text: The M.C. steps up beside Lorraine and takes her arm.
dialog: M.C.
dialog: Lorraine, you’ve got to help me.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Sure, Marty, how?
text: (he tries to speak, but all
text: that comes out are inaudible
dialog: noises)
dialog: What is it?
dialog: M.C.
dialog: You just have to sleep with me, Lorraine. You
dialog: have to.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: | do, huh?
dialog: M.C.
dialog: | love you Lorraine.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Oh, for God’s sake. That's ridiculous.
dialog: M.C.
dialog: 53
dialog: (stung)
dialog: Oh, it is, huh? You want to use the club tomorrow,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: You already said | could use the club tomorrow.
dialog: M.C.
dialog: Right. | did. And | mean it, too. And | don’t
dialog: expect anything in return, either.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Don’t you?
dialog: M.C.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: | thought you honestly cared about the Springfield
dialog: Five.
dialog: M.C.
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Who? Oh, them. Yeah, | do. But Lorraine, please
dialog: think of the good you could do, for me. Please.
text: Lorraine turns and walks away, her expression saying, “When hell freezes over.”
text: Lorraine returns to her table and sits back down.
text: At which point MOUSTAPHA HAKIM arrives. He is a black man in his 30s wearing a
text: dark suit and tie, a round leather, African hat, sunglasses and carrying a particularly
text: beat-up guitar.
text: Terry looks relieved.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: Greetings, folk fans.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You got here.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: 54
dialog: You didn’t think | would?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No, no, | did.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: And who are all of these nice-looking white people?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: You know Lorraine.
text: Moustapha shakes Lorraine’s hand.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Lorraine. Always a pleasure.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: That's Alvin & Debbie.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: Alvin, Debbie.
text: They both shake his hand and both look uncomfortable doing it.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: And this is Phil.
text: Moustapha shakes Phil’s hand, then grabs a chair and seats himself beside him.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: Be prepared, the blues’re coming.
text: Terry leans over to Moustapha and nods toward the back.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Canwe...
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: Cool down, my friend. Everything in good time.
text: Moustapha turns to Phil.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: (nods)
dialog: 55
dialog: You like the blues?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well... Like Chuck Berry.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: Chuck Berry. That’s your idea of blues?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, rhythm and blues. How about Muddy Rivers?
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: That's Muddy Waters.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Right, but | hear he’s formed a group with Johnny
dialog: Rivers.
text: Moustapha turns to Terry.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: Come on, let’s go.
text: Terry grins devilishly as he and Moustapha head off together.
text: Lorraine turns back to Phil.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Having a good time?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh yeah.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: What do you think of Terry?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: He’s interesting.
dialog: 56
text: The M.C. steps up to the small blackboard and erases Alvin & Debbie’s name at the top
text: of the list. The next name is “Bobby Lee.”
dialog: M.C.
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, the Purple Onion welcomes
dialog: back the angry, intense, and always energetic, Bobby
dialog: Lee Baker!
text: The audience applauds excitedly as BOBBY LEE BAKER, a brooding man in his 30s,
text: dressed in black with a beret and a jazz patch. He steps up on the stage with a
text: cigarette smoldering between his lips irritating his eyes. He slowly tunes a 12-string
text: guitar, entirely ignoring the audience. He flicks his cigarette butt without looking and we
text: see that it lands in an inattentive WOMAN ’s drink.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We're living in a world of oppression. White
text: people hold down the black people. Rich
dialog: people hold down the poor people. Some-
dialog: times it makes me so mad | can barely talk.
dialog: Bile builds up in my throat and | can’t even
dialog: spit. Those are the times when you'd kinda
dialog: like to see the whole shebang go up in one
dialog: big ball of fire, know what | mean?
text: The audience looks back at him wide-eyed and silent. Bobby coughs, then suddenly
text: launches into an intense rendition of “/n My Time of Dyin” with some terrific guitar
text: picking, as well as the use of a bottleneck.
speaker_heading: BOBBY LEE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: In my time of dyin’
dialog: Don’t want nobody to mourn
dialog: All | want for you to do
dialog: Is to take my body home
dialog: Well, well, well
dialog: So | can die easy
dialog: Well, well, well
dialog: So | can die easy
dialog: Jesus gonna make up
dialog: 57
dialog: My dyin’ bed
text: The Woman drinks her drink and her eyes widen as she swallows the cigarette butt.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well meet me, Jesus, meet me
dialog: Meet me in the middle of the air
dialog: If these wings should fail me, Lord
dialog: Won't you meet me with another pair
dialog: Well, well, well
dialog: So | can die easy
dialog: Well, well, well
dialog: So | can die easy
dialog: Jesus gonna make up
dialog: My dyin’ bed
dialog: Lord in my time of dyin’
dialog: Don’t want nobody to cry
dialog: All | want you to do
dialog: Is to take me when | die
dialog: Well, well, well
dialog: So | can die easy
dialog: Well, well, well
dialog: So | can die easy
dialog: Jesus gonna make up
dialog: My dyin’ bed
text: There is a big round of applause. To everyone’s astonishment, Bobby Lee Baker
text: stands up and without a look back walks right out of the club.
speaker_heading: BOBBY LEE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Aw shit!
text: Terry and Moustapha returned at some point during the song. Terry turns to Phil.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Man, that was good.
text: Phil looks like he has a headache.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: 58
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (changing subjects)
dialog: So, Lorraine said she met you at some kind of
dialog: meeting, right?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah. SDS.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Students for a Democratic Society.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: And you like try to get laws changed and stuff?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: They do. | go ‘cause there’s usually cute chicks
dialog: there.
dialog: (that seems like a good
dialog: reason to Phil)
dialog: And cute folkie chicks that are always screaming
dialog: about freedom and equality sometimes put out,
dialog: know what | mean?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (he knows)
dialog: So, then you don’t really care about freedom and
dialog: equality and civil rights?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah, sure | do, but not as much as getting laid.
text: Terry wags his eyebrows. Phil grins.
text: We see Lorraine’s stack of yellow flyers in her hand as she crosses the club and steps
text: up to a table where three very cool-looking, beat-types sit, seemingly engrossed in
text: smoking cigarettes and don’t notice Lorraine . They are: DEAN, MARYLOU & BILL.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Look, it’s the three dead beats.
dialog: 59
text: Dean, Bill and MaryLou all look around—where?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Whoa... it’s Lorraine.
speaker_heading: MARYLOU
dialog: Hey, Lorraine.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (grunts)
dialog: Urgh.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Wow, you folks sure look mellow.
speaker_heading: MARYLOU
dialog: Yeah, we are.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Mellowville.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Hooo!
text: Lorraine furrows her brow and leans forward to MaryLou.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: What's wrong with you guys?
speaker_heading: MARYLOU
dialog: Wrong? Nothin’s wrong.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: It’s all right. Everything’s right.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: But you guys are acting weird.
text: MaryLou pantomimes sticking a needle in her arm and winks at Lorraine. Lorraine
text: looks horrified.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: You took heroin?
dialog: 60
scene_heading: MARYLOU, BILL & DEAN
dialog: (together, grinning)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Really?
scene_heading: MARYLOU, BILL & DEAN
dialog: (together)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: But doesn’t it hurt? Y’know, the needle?
speaker_heading: MARYLOU
dialog: nods)
dialog: A little. Then you throw up.

dialog: Yeah, i
dialog: Right, tl
text: Bill points at the yellow flyer:
dialog: Hey, wi
dialog: Itsami
dialog: God, that’s disgusting.
speaker_heading: MARYLOU
dialog: reassuring)
dialog: not. It’s fine. Really.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: ’s fine.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: nods)
dialog: hrowing up is just fine.
dialog: Ss.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: hat’s with that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: eeting I’m having here tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MARYLOU
dialog: Cool. Very cool.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: 61
dialog: Knock ‘em dead, Lorraine. Save everybody.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Yeah, | will. See ya around.
text: Lorraine turns and leaves, shaking her head in disbelief. She puts her hand in her
text: sweater pocket and still doesn’t have any cigarettes. Just then Phil steps up.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Gotta smoke.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: As a matter of fact | do.
text: Phil shakes two out of the pack, puts both of them in his mouth and lights them at the
text: same time—ala Paul Henreid—then hands one to Lorraine.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Very classy.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That's me. I’m the classiest guy you ever knew.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (waves her smoke)
dialog: So? What'dya think?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I'll join up if | get you in the deal.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: If only things were that simple.
text: A female voice calls out...
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE
dialog: (0.S.)
dialog: Lorraine! Over here!
text: Lorraine sees a table with two couples in black and white evening clothes. Even from
dialog: 62
text: this distance we can tell they are smashed. Lorraine winces in pain.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Oh, dear God, what'’re they doing here?
dialog: (to Phil)
dialog: | went to high school with these people.
text: Lorraine and Phil step up to the table. The voice belongs to MINDY, an attractive 19-
text: year old girl in a black strapless evening gown and white gloves. The boys are wearing
text: tuxes. Mindy and Lorraine hug and kiss.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Mindy, what on Earth are you doing here?
speaker_heading: MINDY
dialog: You told us about this hootenanny thing on
dialog: Saturday nights and we decided to come and see
dialog: for ourselves. Are you singing tonight, Lorraine?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Yes, | am.
dialog: (points at Phil)
dialog: So’s he. This is my friend, Phil.
text: Mindy shakes Phil’s hand. She looks him up and down and obviously approves.
speaker_heading: MINDY
dialog: Phil. This is Brian, Cheryl and Tim. I’m Mindy,
dialog: Lorraine’s former best-friend.
text: Phil waves and shakes hands. BRIAN says to Phil. . .
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Are you a musician?
text: Phil glances at Lorraine.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Uh, no. | mean, no. This is a hootenanny,
dialog: anybody can get up and sing.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Right. Of course. Boy am! a square.
dialog: 63
text: Lorraine hands out flyers.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: So now that you've started going new places,
dialog: you should come to this meeting here tomorrow
dialog: night, for the Springfield Five.
speaker_heading: MINDY
dialog: | read about them. Terrible. Tomorrow night?
dialog: Sorry, can’t make it.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: It’s really important, y’know. Couldn’t you try?
speaker_heading: MINDY
dialog: Sorry, it’s out of the question. So, when do we
dialog: get to hear some music?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Soon.
text: TIM raises his hand.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No mixed drinks?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Uh, no. Just beer.
text: Tim and Brian turn to one another, both imitating Jim Backus.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: | need an Old-Fashioned the old-fashioned way.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: The way dear old dad used to make ‘em.
text: Brian and Tim laugh. Lorraine turns to Tim.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: How about you, Tim? What are you doing
dialog: tomorrow night?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: 64
dialog: Sunday night? “Lassie,” then “Ed Sullivan,” then
dialog: “Gunsmoke,” why?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Ring-a-ding-ding!
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Never mind. See ya.
speaker_heading: MINDY
dialog: Bye, Lorraine. Nice meeting you, Phil.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah, you, too.
text: Lorraine and Phil walk away. Lorraine looks back, then at Phil and shakes her head
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: The TV generation.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Are you from another generation?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Apparently.
dialog: (waves her hand)
dialog: This one. Where some things still matter. Ring-
text: a-ding-ding? “Lassie” and “Gunsmoke.” Good
dialog: God! You people and your mindless amusements.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Hey, | didn’t invent this stuff. Blame Edison.
text: Lorraine stops and turns to face Phil.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: But it’s not reality, Phil. We live in reality, where
dialog: there’s suffering and injustice and war.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: 65
dialog: | think you forgot locust and cattle disease.
text: Lorraine gets angry.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: It’s not funny!
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Damn, you are one serious girl. What do you
dialog: want to be when you grow up? Abraham Lincoln?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (smiles)
text: Or a modern female version of him.
text: Phil takes Lorraine’s ink-stained hand.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: | have a great idea that will help all of society.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Let’s drink some more beer. Did | mention that
dialog: beer is like liquid bread?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Yes, you did.
text: They sit down at the table.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well it is, you know. And dark beer is like

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah, but | like getting drunk.
dialog: 66
text: They toast and drink.
text: The M.C. steps back up to the small blackboard and erases Bobby Lee’s name. Phil
text: watches the M.C. erase the name, then looks down to his own first name at the bottom
text: of the list. There’s still seven people above him, but nevertheless Phil is getting
text: nervous. He glances at his guitar, then scratches his chin. The next name listed is
dialog: “Moustapha.”
text: The M.C. steps up to the microphone.
dialog: M.C.
dialog: I'd now like to introduce a personal friend of mine...
text: (he winks at Moustapha
dialog: who shakes his head)
dialog: . .. Moustapha Hakim!
text: Moustapha stands holding his beat-up guitar and steps in front of the microphone.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: Greetings, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to sing

text: free. In America Negroes are still slaves, sitting in the
text: back of the bus, living in the ghetto, dying in
dialog: poverty. The Springfield Five are just one more
dialog: example of the American hypocrisy.
text: The audience feels ashamed. Lorraine looks around and grins. Moustapha then sings
dialog: “Bourgeois Blues.”
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Me and my wife
dialog: Went out on the town
dialog: Everywhere we went

speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: The blues have come.
speaker_heading: TERRY
text: And they were gone, man, solid gone.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: Thank you.
text: They slap five.
text: The M.C. gets back up on stage and erases Moustapha’s name. Phil notes this with a
text: wince. Next on the list is “4 Feathers.”
dialog: M.C.
dialog: And now I'd like to introduce some Purple Onion
dialog: hootenanny regulars, ladies and gentlemen will you
dialog: please welcome the incredible harmonies of The Four

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: | can’t do this.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Sure you can. You'll be fine.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: No, no, you don’t understand.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (smiles reassuringly)
dialog: Of course | do. Everyone feels this way their first

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah, but these people are really good.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Right. And their not professionals.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah, but they really seem to... care.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Well, don’t you?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (good question)
dialog: Um...
text: Lorraine spots someone she knows and quickly exits.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: ‘Scuse me.
text: Phil is in a deep quandary. He glances over at the door—he could just leave and no
text: one would be the wiser. Meanwhile, Terry is watching him.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What's wrong?
dialog: 72
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (sighs deeply)
dialog: Lorraine is doing the song that | was gonna do.
dialog: | was all ready, too, y'know. | practiced the song

speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Just come on.
text: Terry leads Phil out the back door.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PURPLE ONION/ALLEY — NIGHT
text: Terry and Phil come out into the under-lit alley behind the Purple Onion. Terry pulls out
text: a big, fat, crooked cigarette. Phil can’t believe it. He looks all around to make sure
dialog: they're alone.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: That's marijuana, isn’t it?
text: Terry nods, lighting up.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Say it louder, maybe a cop’ll hear you.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: But, it’s illegal.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Doesn't it lead to hard drugs like morphine and
dialog: heroin?
dialog: 73
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (grins fiendishly)
dialog: Whoa! Slow down, tiger. One step at a time.
text: Terry hands Phil the burning joint. Phil hesitantly takes it, gives the issue one more
text: brief moment of consideration, shrugs, then takes a hit.
scene_heading: INT. THE PURPLE ONION — NIGHT
text: Lorraine sits back down in her seat, looking somewhat embarrassed and straightens
text: her hair. She notices that Phil and Terry’s chairs are empty. She glances around as
text: though people are looking at her and pulls her sweater closed. The M.C. steps up to
text: the microphone, grinning, his hair askew.
dialog: M.C.
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, I’m proud to welcome
dialog: back a Purple Onion regular, a dedicated fighter
dialog: for equality and justice, and the organizer of
dialog: the Springfield Five defense fund meeting here
dialog: tomorrow at eight. Let’s give a warm hand to
dialog: Lorraine Dempsey!
text: Lorraine throws a last look at the empty seats on either side of her where Phil and Terry
text: used to be, shakes her head, smiles and heads up on stage holding her guitar.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Sometimes it’s not easy to do what's right. We're
dialog: always tempted to go the other way. To take the
dialog: wrong path. And sometimes we don’t even know
dialog: which path we’re on. Justice, freedom and equality
dialog: are not just words. They’re goals that we have to
dialog: work for. That's why | strongly urge you to be here
dialog: tomorrow night at eight P.M. for a very important
dialog: meeting. We can make a difference . . .
scene_heading: EXT. THE PURPLE ONION/ALLEY — NIGHT
text: Phil and Terry are just finishing the joint. Their eyes are bloodshot and at half-mast.
dialog: They're stoned.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: 74
dialog: Man, If | had a hammer I'd hurt myself.
text: They both laugh like total idiots.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: So, what’dya think?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: About what?
text: (Terry waves his hand,
dialog: Phil grins)
dialog: Oh, yeah. Boss. Is it always like this?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: This?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Wow. How much is this stuff?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Pretty cheap.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: And you got it from... um
dialog: (he can’t remember)
dialog: That Negro man.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Moustapha. Right.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Does he grow it.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No, man. He gets it from someone else who gets
dialog: it from someone else who brings it from Panama
dialog: or Mexico or wherever.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: 75
dialog: Wow! Too much! | feel like I’m in Panama or
dialog: Mexico or wherever now.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah. | know what you mean. Wherever’s where
dialog: it’s at.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: And that’s where we are. Where it’s at.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah.
text: They start laughing idiotically again.
scene_heading: INT. THE PURPLE ONION — NIGHT

dialog: 76
text: Terry is holding forth to a stoned and completely rapt Phil.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Elvis and Chuck Berry and Little Richard
dialog: and Jerry Lee Lewis all had their careers
dialog: taken from them, man. Where'd they all
dialog: go? What happened to rock & roll? They
text: were stopped, drafted, arrested, persecuted.
dialog: Their careers were stopped. Why? It’s
dialog: because there’s a conspiracy to stop rock
dialog: & roll, and I’m telling you it’s the same
dialog: guys that killed Kennedy.
text: Phil has no idea what Terry’s talking about.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Killed Kennedy? Lee Harvey Oswald killed
dialog: Kennedy.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (lights up)
dialog: Ah ha! That’s what they’d like you to believe.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Then Jack Ruby killed Oswald.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Pretty convenient, huh? Get rid of the patsy.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: But | saw it on TV.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yeah? | see “Howdy Doody” on TV but that don’t
dialog: make it true.
text: Phil looks all around, freaking out.
scene_heading: INT. THE PURPLE ONION — NIGHT
text: Lorraine finishes the song with a flurry.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Well, | have a hammer
dialog: 77
dialog: And | have a bell
dialog: And | have a song to sing
dialog: All over this land
dialog: It's the hammer of justice
dialog: It’s the bell of free-e-dom
dialog: It's a song about love between
dialog: My brother and my sisters
dialog: All over this land
text: Lorraine receives a big round of applause. She glances at the two empty seats and
text: furrows her brow. The audience hollers for “More!”
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: All right. Now we’re all gonna sing a song
dialog: together, because we all have to stick together
dialog: if we’re gonna make things better. And we can
dialog: all start by being here tomorrow night at eight
dialog: to help put together the defense fund for the
dialog: Springfield Five. OK? Now, instead of singing
dialog: “the” union, let’s all sing “our’ union, OK?
dialog: And if you don’t know the verses, just join in
dialog: for the chorus.
text: Lorraine begins to play the melody to “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” which
text: becomes “Solidarity Forever.” The audience hesitantly joins in at first, but gets stronger
text: with each chorus.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Solidarity forever

text: There is the biggest round of applause of the evening. Everybody laughs and cheers.
text: Lorraine returns to her table to the smiles of her friends, then seats herself between the
text: two empty seats and frowns. Debbie is drunk and gives Lorraine a fresh beer and
text: another cigarette, which Lorraine gratefully takes. Alvin keeps one hand on his wife’s

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (drunk)
dialog: Good job, Lorraine. Solidarity forever!
speaker_heading: ALVIN
dialog: (drunk)
dialog: That was great, Lorraine, just great.

dialog: This kid is gonna grow up in a better world than

text: out and busted.
text: Lorraine looks all around.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Have you seen Terry or Phil?
text: Alvin and Debbie look around.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No.
text: Lorraine stands.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: I'll be back in a sec.
text: Lorraine leaves. Debbie drunkenly turns back to Alvin.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And that’s why you've got to get a better job.
speaker_heading: ALVIN
dialog: Oh, Jesus Christ! | don’t give a shit about a better
dialog: job, can’t you get that through your thick skull?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: 80
dialog: | get it, but I’m not buyin’ it.
text: Phil and Terry return and they’re toasted and giggling. Terry gives Moustapha the
text: thumbs-up.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I'll go get some more beer.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Good thinking.
text: Phil sits down beside Moustapha.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: So, uh... Moustachio—
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: —Moustapha.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Exactly. So, what's it like being a Negro?
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Boy, you are stoned.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Yeah? | guess so. Everything has sort of an
dialog: echo.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: “What's it like being a Negro?” Shit! What’s
dialog: it like being a silly little stoned white boy?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (grins foolishly)
dialog: Not bad. Pretty good, actually.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: But that wears off. Bein’ black don’t. Everywhere
dialog: you go, all the time, you still a Negro, and you’re
dialog: generally outnumbered, unless you're in the ghetto.
dialog: All the white folk are friendly here tonight, but that
dialog: don’t mean they won't be back out lynchin’ niggers
dialog: 81
dialog: again tomorrow.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (this is heavy)
dialog: Wow!
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Wow! Golly gee-whiz!
dialog: (points at Phil)
dialog: | was down in Birmingham last year for Dr. King’s
dialog: big march, the one where he got arrested. You hear
dialog: about that?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Uh... maybe.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: (shakes his head sadly)
dialog: Shit! You don’t know anything, do you? Your head’s
text: as empty as a bucket, that’s why you hear an echo.
dialog: What're you doin’ here, anyway? You ain’t no folkie.
dialog: You ain’t committed to no causes.
text: Phil points at Lorraine who is talking to a guy at another table.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: She invited me.
speaker_heading: MOUSTAPHA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yeah, the great recruiter, Sweet Lorraine.
dialog: (gets serious)
dialog: Y’know, man, we all stand for somethin’, even if
dialog: we don’t know what it is. You can either stand for
dialog: something on purpose or by mistake, but either way
dialog: you still do. Think about it.
text: Phil does think about it. When he looks up Moustapha has left and he’s the only one
text: left sitting at the table. He immediately gets paranoid, thinking that everyone must be
text: looking at him. He can’t figure out what to do with his hands. Phil starts biting his
text: nails. He stops himself and lights a cigarette from a pack on the table.
dialog: 82
text: Lorraine sits down beside Phil.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: You missed my songs.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You sang more than one?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Two. They went over very well.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well that’s cool.
text: She looks Phil in the eyes and shakes her head in disapproval.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: You and Terry smoked pot?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (stutters)
dialog: Um... Thatis... We,uh...
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: That's so irresponsible.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What'dya mean?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Phil, you’re about to go on.
text: Phil waves his hand, smiling.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No, no, no. There’s still gotta be six or seven
dialog: people ahead of me. He said they probably
dialog: wouldn’t get to me anyway.
text: Phil points at the blackboard and there are still quite a few people ahead of him, except
text: the M.C. suddenly picks up the eraser and erases all the names above Phil’s name.
text: Now Phil is next. Phil’s mouth drops open in panic.
dialog: 83
dialog: M.C.
dialog: Due to several last minute cancellations, may |
dialog: introduce one more good friend of Lorraine’s,
dialog: Phil Butler!
text: Phil gets a squeeze on the arm from Lorraine and a thumbs-up from Terry, Moustapha,
dialog: Alvin and Debbie.
text: Phil makes his way onstage, which is a very long walk. He sits down on the stool,
text: strums his guitar, coughs, squints up at the bright lights glaring in his eyes.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That’s Buckley, not Butler.
text: The audience could really give a shit less. And sadly, Phil hasn’t got the slightest clue
text: what to play. This is the worst moment of his entire life. Phil suddenly has super-sonic
text: hearing and sight — he can hear people breathing, puffing on cigarettes, moving their
text: chairs, all looking at him expectantly.
text: Phil moves closer to the lower, guitar microphone and gets feedback. Phil suddenly
text: shoves the microphone into the hole in the guitar and proceeds to do the Elvis-style
dialog: version of “If | Had a Hammer.”
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: If | had a h-h-h-hammer
text: Pd h-h-h-hammer in the mornin’
dialog: I'd h-h-h-hammer in the evenin’
dialog: All over this crazy old land, oh yeah!
text: There is a big solid moment when the audience has absolutely no idea what they are
text: watching. They look befuddled. Phil doesn’t care. In for a penny in for a pound. He
dialog: goes for it...
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: l'd-a hammer out danger
dialog: ?’'d-a hammer out warnin’
dialog: ’'d-a hammer out-a love between
dialog: My brothers and my sisters
dialog: All over this land
text: Phil does the Chuck Berry duckwalk. The audience is sufficiently drunk so that they
text: begin to clap along, hooting and hollering. Phil grabs two beer bottles and clanks them
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: If | had a bell
dialog: I'd ring-a-ding-ding it in the mornin’
dialog: I'd ring-a-ding-ding it in the evenin’

dialog: I'd sing out love between

dialog: All over this land
dialog: (gives a big pelvis shake)
dialog: Ha!
text: There is a huge round of applause for Phil. He takes a bow, happily surprised at the
text: turn of events. The M.C. comes on.
dialog: M.C.
dialog: That's Phil Buckley, not Butler. Sorry about
dialog: that, buddy. Very funny routine. You ought to
dialog: be on Ed Sullivan. Anyway, thanks for coming to
dialog: the Purple Onion’s weekly Hootenany. And don’t
dialog: forget about the defense fund meeting for the Springfield
dialog: Five tomorrow. And thanks for coming. Last call.
text: Many people stand up to leave.
text: Lorraine looks at Phil in astonishment as he gulps down a beer. Terry is grinning and
text: slaps Phil on the back.

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: This guy is a wild man.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: | can’t decide whether that was inspired or

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: | don’t know.

dialog: Yeah, goodnight Terry. Nice meeting you.
dialog: Terry sees what's what.
speaker_heading: TERRY

text: Phil lies in bed asleep. The sound of the lawnmower engine slowly wakes him up. Phil

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: DAN

scene_heading: MR. BUCKLEY

dialog: Is it right for a woman to make less money doing

scene_heading: MRS. BUCKLEY
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That's right. And is it right for Negroes to have

scene_heading: MRS. BUCKLEY
dialog: Well, no.
speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (fascinated)
dialog: Really? How?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: It's very complicated and you probably won't
dialog: 93
dialog: understand, but it’s what’s called a “conspiracy,”
text: which means that a bunch of people were involved.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yeah? How many?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: | don’t know, but a bunch. So then, after they
dialog: stopped rock & roll by sending Elvis away to
dialog: the army, they decided they had to kill Kennedy
dialog: to keep him quiet.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Really? That's creepy. What else did they do?
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: They set Lee Harvey Oswald up as a patsy, then

text: Dan is horrified.
speaker_heading: DAN
