text: A God's-eye view of a long, winding stream of traffic,

dialog: 3
text: As the California sun beats brilliantly down, as the rush

dialog: From here,
dialog: other than
dialog: moment, we
dialog: blown hair
dialog: who she is
dialog: there is little to be learned about the driver
text: the obvious fact that she is a woman. For a
text: see nothing of the world other than her windbillowing and curling. And so the mystery of
dialog: and why we are traveling with her only deepens.
text: Then, abruptly, VARIOUS CUTS of her hands on the wheel, of
text: the speedometer, of her hand on the stickshift, etc.
dialog: Occasionally, we sweep up to the mountains or down to the
text: ocean or past the fence of some tony piece of real estate
dialog: overlooking the water. But, always, we return to our point

text: The driver's door opens and out swivels NINA: 38 years old,
text: bright, attractive. But more than merely intelligent, she
text: is shrewd; more than simply beautiful, she is alluring.
text: And, perhaps, more to the point, she is shy about neither.
text: So one senses power as she rises out of the car, just as
text: one senses insight as she takes a long, penetrating look
text: around, just as one sees poise and grace as she glides
text: toward the house.

text: From the dramatic slope of the roof to the exposed rafters

text: off her shoes before continuing barefoot down the HALLWAY.
text: The day's mail awaits her, stacked tidily on a chest midway
text: down the hall. Taking the mail in hand, she begins sorting
text: through it even as she ascends the short staircase to the
text: MAIN ENTERTAINING AREA of the house.
text: There she stands, in the middle of the floor, absorbed in
text: some letter or other, when footsteps come quickly down a
text: staircase and DEE DEE appears.
text: Dee Dee, a very young, very eager, very uncertain 24-yearold, lets out a slightly startled gasp at the sight of
text: Nina, who looks up coolly from her letter.
speaker_heading: DEE DEE
text: (painfully self-conscious,

dialog: glance at her watch)
dialog: You're home?

text: the other, Nina sprawls leisurely on a sofa.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: And how were things around here?
text: But before Dee Dee can utter even syllable, Nina cuts her
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Oh, did that what's-his-name, the
dialog: strange bald lawyer call?
speaker_heading: DEE DEE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: How about Douglas — did he reconfirm
dialog: for this afternoon?
speaker_heading: DEE DEE
dialog: No, no one called.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: If he ever does call me here, it's
dialog: fine to give the number for the car —
dialog: the lawyer. He represents Merkey,
dialog: the artist I'm showing next month.
dialog: Douglas already has
dialog: the number. Which must mean he's
text: still coming — if he didn't call.
speaker_heading: DEE DEE
dialog: (not knowing if this

speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: And how is Mr. Li?
speaker_heading: DEE DEE
dialog: He cleared out that underbrush, where
dialog: you asked about.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: DEE DEE
dialog: Did the deep-root fertilization, too.
text: Dee Dee hovers a little too near the sofa, prompting Nina
text: to gaze up at her expectantly.
speaker_heading: DEE DEE
dialog: I paid all the bills, the checks are
dialog: on your desk, you just have to sign
dialog: them. And I bought some haddock from
dialog: the fishman this morning, I made a
dialog: curry sauce to go with it, all you
dialog: have to do is pop it in the oven, I
dialog: left the directions.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: And you'd like to go home now.
text: Dee Dee nods sheepishly.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Go.

speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: And you told him yes, I hope.
text: Dee Dee nods.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: You're a good little wife, Dee Dee.
dialog: Every woman should have one.
text: Taking this as a compliment, she smiles and disappears.
text: After a moment, the front door opens and closes. After a

text: It is a slow and sultry dance, and her eyes, rapt
text: hypnotically, never leave the mirror as she slides out of
text: her skirt ... her blouse ... her nylons ... her bra....
dialog: Only gradually does it occur to us that there may be
dialog: something other than prurience at stake here. This strip
text: is not a tease but a conscious peeling away of layer upon
text: layer of her well-ordered, well-practiced life. If she
text: stares, it's only because she is making certain that
text: absolutely nothing of her accustomed life is left.

text: As he slides out from behind the wheel and unbends himself

text: At 44, he seems to be in equal parts showing his age and
text: hiding it. Yes, his face is deeply lined. Yes, he is as
text: grey as he is not. Yet, at the same time, he is as lean
text: and agile as he was 20 years earlier.
text: With hair that seems a day or two shy of its next trim and
text: clothing that is — in a word — utilitarian, he resembles
dialog: nothing so much as the publisher of a natural foods
dialog: catalogue.
text: From his place by the car, he eyes the house for a moment.
text: Then, pushing forward the driver's seat, he leans in and
text: dislodges a long, rectangular object (his unassembled,
text: portable massage table) that is wedged diagonally across
text: the interior of the car.
text: Along with the massage table, he pulls out what used to be
text: known as a "gym bag." He then glances at his watch, locks

speaker_heading: NINA

dialog: or anyone else's.
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Because they consult with you, they

speaker_heading: FITCH

speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: FITCH
text: Massage. Maybe even earlier, some
dialog: historians think. The Greeks were
dialog: into massage mainly as a treatment, a
dialog: healing art. They've got records of
dialog: people like Socrates and Plato being
dialog: massaged daily. And Plato lived to
dialog: be 104.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Socrates did not.
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: (undeterred)
dialog: But the Romans being who they were —
dialog: essentially Italians without the
dialog: loafers — they were the first to come
dialog: up with the idea of massage as a form
dialog: of foreplay. Courtesans got pretty
dialog: handy at it. It was part of the
dialog: transaction, finally.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Well, it's not like you have to have

speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: It's a form of communication. You

speaker_heading: FITCH

speaker_heading: NINA

speaker_heading: FITCH

dialog: you've been preparing —
text: (suddenly, a thought
dialog: occurs to him)
dialog: Why, are you in a hurry?
text: Before she can reply, he pulls an extremely odd and not

dialog: Douglas.
text: Every now and then, she lets out a small, involuntary sigh,

speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: You were going to say something about
dialog: how tense I am....
text: Maybe he was. More likely he was undergoing some out-ofbody experience, so deep is his concentration on the area
text: of her back that he massages.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Douglas always does. He's always
dialog: telling me how much tension I have.
dialog: Especially in my upper back, my
dialog: shoulders. It's all because of my
dialog: work....
text: A beat of expectation, as she waits for him to question her
text: about her work. Then, when he does not, when he simply
text: continues massaging her in intense silence, she answers
dialog: anyway:
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I own a gallery. A couple of them,
dialog: actually. One here in town, off
dialog: Melrose. Another in New York,
dialog: Tribeca. And when it's your business,
dialog: your baby — well, you know what they
dialog: say about responsibility falling on
dialog: your shoulders. It does — literally.
dialog: A beat, then:
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: It's best not to talk so much.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Was I? talking too much?
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Well, it's your massage. You can do
dialog: anything you'd like. But you really

text: sight of the man at his easel captures her imagination.
text: She makes a u-turn and drives back.

speaker_heading: NINA

speaker_heading: FITCH

speaker_heading: FITCH

speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: But, usually, it was just the family:
dialog: my parents, my sister and me.
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: It's funny. Talking about roles. My
dialog: parents had these roles that they always
dialog: seemed to ... inhabit. My father was the
dialog: shrewd businessman. My mother was the
dialog: thoughtful patron of the arts. Which
dialog: was, as it turned out, a kind of fiction.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: How?
text: Making his hands broad, he massages all over her buttocks
text: in big, circular strokes.
speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Well, it was all the same to her.
dialog: Classical music. Classical art.
dialog: Didn't matter who or what it was. It
text: was all lovely. The woman — and over
dialog: the years I've come to almost admire
dialog: this about her — she didn't have a
text: critical bone in her body. She was
dialog: the sort of person they created

speaker_heading: NINA

speaker_heading: NINA

speaker_heading: FITCH

speaker_heading: NINA

speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Well, like, Doug. He said you were —
dialog: the word he used was
dialog: adrift. He never mentioned anything
dialog: about being single or not being
dialog: single. He never mentioned anything

text: miserable by them.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: And there are people who live in

speaker_heading: FITCH
dialog: Not true. They carry memories.
dialog: That's the way they're meaningful —
dialog: as a link to other people.
speaker_heading: NINA

speaker_heading: NINA

text: He stands back for a moment, as if not quite knowing what

text: thickly across her belly, from just below her breasts.
text: He now begins some short, deep strokes across her abdomen,
dialog: careful to avoid even the slightest contact with anything
text: like an erogenous zone.
dialog: Sexual contact would, in any case, be totally extraneous at
