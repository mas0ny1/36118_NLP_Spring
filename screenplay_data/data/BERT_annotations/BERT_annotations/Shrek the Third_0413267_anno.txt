dialog: 
text: Lightning cracks. Thunder booms. Charming straddles a

text: stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background.
text: In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound
text: effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK
dialog: Fiona!
dialog: 
text: He trips over his pants and hits a loose wooden plank on the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Just think... a couple more days,
dialog: and we'll be back home in our
text: vermin-filled shack, strewn with
text: fungus, filled with the rotting
text: stench of mud and neglect.
dialog: 
text: This thought calms him. Shrek takes in a long, deep breath

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK
dialog: Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: And, uh... maybe even the pitter-

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK

speaker_heading: ALL

speaker_heading: SHREK
dialog: This really isn't up to you!
dialog: 
text: Artie falls underneath the wheel. He stands up shoving the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK
dialog: Back to what? Being a loser?!
dialog: 
text: As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he's gone

speaker_heading: SHREK (CONT'D)
dialog: Now look what you did!

speaker_heading: ARTIE

speaker_heading: SHREK

dialog: You know what? Why don't you go

speaker_heading: SHREK

speaker_heading: (TO MERLIN)
dialog: Now which way am I kicking?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Oh, I could tell you. But since

speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Now all of you, look into the "Fire
dialog: of Truth" and tell me what you see!
dialog: Yah! Ha!
dialog: (Wild war cry)
dialog: Woo-looo-looo-looo!
dialog: 
text: He points at the smoke and it starts to form objects (i.e.
text: Rorschach inkblots).
dialog: 
text: Puss and Donkey, excited, sit by the fire.

speaker_heading: DONKEY
dialog: Ooo! Charades! Okay, I see a

text: swirls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Okay. Monster, go for it.
dialog: 
text: Shrek glances at the fire. The stroller from his nightmare

text: He covers his fear and changes the subject.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK
text: I see a rainbow pony.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: Ow!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: You're lame! Now just go for it.
dialog: 
text: He tosses more dirt and flames burst up. Artie studies it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: Okay. There's a baby bird and a

dialog: 
text: Merlin starts beating a drum. Artie's expression starts to
text: change as he stays focused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: Wait, the dad just flew away. Why
dialog: did he leave the little bird all
dialog: alone?
dialog: 
text: Shrek starts to take this in as he watches. Artie gets more
dialog: worked up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
text: It's trying to fly, but it doesn't
dialog: know how to. It.. it's gonna fall!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Artie catches what he said. As the smoke drifts
text: away, he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him,
text: stunned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Whew, proper head case you are,
dialog: aren't you? Really messed up.
dialog: Whoa.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: Yeah, yeah, okay. I get it. The

speaker_heading: SHREK
speaker_heading: (CLEARS THROAT)
dialog: Look Artie...um-
dialog: 
text: Just as he's about to get going, "That's What Friends Are

text: drowning out any conversation. They all turn toward the
text: shack where Merlin peeks out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: (loud, over the music)
dialog: Just thought I might help set the
dialog: mood! Y'know for your big heart to
dialog: heart chat!
dialog: 
text: Everyone stares at him.
dialog: 
text: He sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door. It's
text: quiet again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK
dialog: I know what it's like to not feel

dialog: 
text: Artie looks at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK
dialog: Even ogres get scared...you know,
dialog: once in a while.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: I know you want me to be king, but
dialog: I can't. I'm not cut out for it and
dialog: I never will be, alright?
dialog: 
text: Shrek takes this in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth
dialog: the trouble. He dumped me at that

dialog: I never heard from him again.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK
dialog: My dad wasn't really the fatherly

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: Well, I doubt he was worse than
dialog: mine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK
dialog: Oh yeah? My father was an ogre.
dialog: He tried to eat me.
dialog: 
text: Artie looks at Shrek.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK
dialog: Now, I guess I should have seen it
dialog: coming. He used to give me a bath
dialog: in barbecue sauce and put me to bed
text: with an apple in my mouth.
dialog: 
text: Artie chuckles at this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: Okay... I guess that's... pretty
dialog: bad.
dialog: 
text: Artie laughs and then pokes at the fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK
dialog: You know, it may be hard to believe
dialog: what with my obvious charm and good
dialog: looks, but people used to think
dialog: that I was a monster. And for a
dialog: long time, I believed them.
dialog: 
text: Artie looks up at Shrek.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK (CONT'D)
dialog: But after awhile, you learn to
dialog: ignore the names that people call
dialog: you and you just trust who you are.
dialog: 
text: Artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: You know, you're okay, Shrek.
dialog: 
text: He tosses the stick into the fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: You just need to do a little less

text: Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 69.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHREK
dialog: Thanks Artie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE

text: pirate bounces off Shrek's belly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HOOK
dialog: Ready the plank!
dialog: 
text: A wooden board is thrown on a stump, creating a makeshift
text: "plank." The pirates back Shrek onto the plank.
dialog: 
text: Several pirates with swords force Shrek onto the plank. He
text: is backed up to the edge of the plank and falls into a

dialog: 
text: Puss, Donkey and Artie are trying to hold off the Villains.
text: Suddenly, two Evil Trees come into frame and scoop Puss,
text: Donkey and Artie up in a net.
dialog: 
text: The pirates aim the cannon at Puss, Donkey and Artie. Artie
text: starts to panic. Puss extracts his claws and tries to cut
text: through the netting.
dialog: 
text: The cannon fuse is lit.
dialog: 
text: Shrek bursts open the treasure chest and stands up with the
text: chest still stuck to his behind.

speaker_heading: ARTIE

dialog:

text: He tosses the chest onto the other end of the plank and
text: catapults himself over to the cannon. At the last second,
text: Shrek is able to aim the cannon in the opposite direction.
text: The cannon fires and hits Captain Hook's piano, blowing it
text: into pieces.
dialog: 
text: Realizing their defeat, the Evil Trees drop the netting that
