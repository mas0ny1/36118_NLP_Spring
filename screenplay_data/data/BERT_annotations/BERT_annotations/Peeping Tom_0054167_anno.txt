dialog: Leo Marks
text: The screen remains dark for a moment.
text: In the darkness WE HEAR the film's THEME MUSIC - a gentle
text: whirring purring noise. Nothing to be alarmed about. It
text: might be a small contented motor.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT
text: LONG SHOT of the solitary figure of a WOMAN standing
text: professionally alone at the end of the street.
text: It is a bright, still night. We can HEAR the Woman whistling
text: 'Stardust' merrily to herself.
text: CAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid.
text: We HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath -
text: haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman.
text: As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then
text: turns round for a better look.
text: Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the
dialog: man's.
text: CLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still
text: young enough to need two glances at the customers.
text: She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception. She
text: hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully...
text: and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed
dialog: at.
speaker_heading: DORA
dialog: It'll be two quid...
dialog: Evidently we have two quid.
text: She beams with relief - throws her fur over her shoulders,
text: jerks her head towards the right - and sets off.
text: CAMERA TRACKS after her. Overlaid is the sound of the
text: man's footsteps.
text: Dora resumes her whistling. So, under his breath, does the
text: man who is following her.
scene_heading: EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT
text: A wider street than the last - but just as empty.
text: Dora sways her way towards a small house. CAMERA FOLLOWS
text: at a respectful distance.
text: CAMERA PANS from Dora's hips to an overflowing dustbin.
text: CLOSE SHOT of a man's hand throwing something into the
text: dustbin. It is an empty packet marked Kodak Film. CAMERA
text: PANS to Dora's house. It stands next to a chemist shop.
text: Dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door -
text: glances round at us encouragingly - then unlocks the door.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: She switches on a light - and hurries up a flight of stairs.
text: CAMERA TRACKS after her.
text: She changes her tune to 'Goodnight Sweetheart'... and so -
text: under his breath - does the Man who is following her.
text: A woman with hair like a two-toned car comes down the
text: stairs, winks at Dora - looks at us for a moment with great
text: curiosity... winks... then passes out of camera.
text: Dora reaches the landing - we are close behind her.
scene_heading: INT. LANDING OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Dora unlocks the door of her room - and goes inside.
scene_heading: INT. DORA'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: She switches on the light, throws her fur onto a chair,
text: lights the gas fire then turns round.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Dora. She holds out her hand-smiling.
text: And suddenly. There is a gentle whirring purring sound.
text: CAMERA HOLDS ON Dora - she is staring at something with
dialog: great curiosity.
text: It turns quickly to bewilderment - and the bewilderment to
text: fear. She steps back from CAMERA - but CAMERA won't have
dialog: it.
text: Dora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her
text: mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face.
text: The sound purrs on.

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: BLACK AND WHITE FILM SEQUENCE
text: The solitary figure of Dora standing professionally alone
text: at the end of a street. WE SEE her turn towards CAMERA -
text: and smile at us.
text: We are watching her on a 16mm screen - projected in BLACK
text: AND WHITE.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the surround in natural colour.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: A darkened room in natural COLOUR. The movie screen images
text: are in BLACK AND WHITE.
text: We can SEE the back of a Man's head as he bends intently
text: over a projector. He is watching Dora on the screen. He is
text: breathing quickly.
text: We see Dora's hips waggling their way home.
text: The Man raises his head, so that we cannot see the screen.
text: When he lowers it again, we see the Woman with the two-
text: toned hair winking at Dora... then we see Dora throwing
text: her fur onto a chair - and turning towards us.
text: WE SEE her staring at something in bewilderment... then
text: backing away from CAMERA in fear.
text: WE HEAR the Man breathing as if at the end of a very long
dialog: race.
text: As Dora opens her mouth to scream, and a shadow falls across
dialog: her face - the title:
speaker_heading: PEEPING TOM
text: Blots out what is happening to her.
text: OTHER CREDITS FOLLOW... behind them we can see Dora's hands
text: pushing something away.
text: Before the DIRECTOR'S CREDIT:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A PARK - NIGHT
text: It is very dark.
text: CLOSE SHOT of a stack of deck chairs.
text: Two forms behind it - a MAN'S and a WOMAN'S.
text: They are intertwined and motionless... suddenly a brilliant
text: shaft of light is trained onto them.
text: Overlaid is a gentle, whirring sound.
text: CAMERA PANS quickly to a nearby tree.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the lens of a cine-camera - the motor
text: purring... a blinding spotlight.
text: CAMERA PANS to the couple - the whirring of the camera is
text: overlaid.
text: The Man leaps up - shielding his eyes against the light.
text: He advances towards the tree.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hey, you peeping...
text: The spotlight goes out. There is the sound of footsteps
text: running away  and the night is at peace again.
text: And now WE SEE who DIRECTED the picture.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: LONG SHOT. AMBULANCE - DAY
text: It is standing in the roadway outside Dora's house.
text: WE SEE it through the finder of a small cine-camera.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS BY DORA'S HOUSE - DAY
text: A crowd has gathered outside the house - and we are watching
text: them from a corner of the street (ALWAYS THROUGH THE FINDER-
speaker_heading: MATTE).
text: WE SEE several Policemen holding back the crowd as two
text: Ambulance Men hurry into the house, carrying an empty
dialog: stretcher.
text: Gentle, whirring sound is overlaid.
text: WE SEE children staring curiously into the empty ambulance -
text: and a group of Women talking excitedly to a Reporter.
text: CLOSE SHOT of a SMALL MAN looking at us curiously as he
text: approaches (FILLING THE SCREEN WITHIN THE MATTE).
speaker_heading: SMALL MAN
dialog: What paper are you from?
text: The finder is lowered.
text: CLOSE SHOT of a Young Man (MARK) sighting a cine-camera.
text: He lowers the camera - and turns politely to his
dialog: interrogator.
text: He seems to have slight difficulty informing his words.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: SMALL MAN
dialog: What paper are you from?
text: Mark smiles at him pleasantly.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The Observer.
text: The Ambulance Men come out of the house carrying the
text: stretcher... there is a body on it covered by a sheet.
text: Mark raises his cine-camera and photographs them. He
text: photographs the ambulance as it drives off. He photographs
text: the Policemen dispersing the crowd. He photographs his
text: Interrogator, who gladly poses for him.
text: Then he slings his camera over his shoulder, and strolls
dialog: away.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: CLOSE SHOT of Dora, smiling happily.
text: Her photograph is on the front page of a newspaper.
text: Above it is a caption: BRUTALLY MURDERED.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK - to show sexy magazines alongside the
dialog: newspaper.
scene_heading: EXT. A NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY
text: Mark is staring at a newspaper in the window of a small
text: newsagent's shop.
text: He glances distastefully at an array of film magazines -
text: showing actresses showing everything - then hurries into
dialog: the shop.
scene_heading: INT. NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY
text: A plump, bald-headed Man stares at Mark.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: You're late!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sorry, sir.
text: He turns towards a small door at the end of the shop.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Hold on, Mark.
text: Mark turns round.
text: Mr. Peters hesitates, drumming his fingers on the counter.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He starts to drum his fingers on a
dialog: shelf.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: Mark... I've a question for you.
text: He stops drumming his fingers. So, at that moment, does
dialog: Mark.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: Which magazines sell the most
dialog: copies?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Those with girls on the front covers -
text: and no front covers on the girls.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: Exactly!... And it's just the same
dialog: with the work you do for me.
text: Overlaid is the sound of the door opening.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: Look busy.
text: Mark busies himself sorting some newspapers.
text: A whole row of Doras smile up at him.
text: CAMERA PANS to doorway of the shop.
text: An ELDERLY GENTLEMAN is standing there.
scene_heading: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
dialog: The Times, please.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: Certainly, sir.
scene_heading: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
dialog: And The Telegraph.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: Certainly, sir - anything else?
text: The Elderly Gentleman hesitates - glancing at Mark's back.
dialog: Then:
scene_heading: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
dialog: I... er... have been told by a
dialog: friend that you... er... have some
dialog: views for sale?
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: What sort of views, sir?
scene_heading: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
dialog: Well, er...
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: This sort, sir?
text: From under the counter he produces a thick book. Mark turns
dialog: round.
text: From his POV WE SEE the Elderly Gentleman open the book.
dialog: He - er- seems - er - more than a little interested.
scene_heading: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
dialog: I, er... how much each?
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: Five shillings, sir.
scene_heading: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
dialog: I'll take this one... and, er...
dialog: this one... and, er... how much
dialog: would the lot be?
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: To you - five pounds, sir...
text: The Elderly Gentleman hesitates. Mr. Peters turns over a
text: page... and the Elderly Gentleman almost turns over with
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: Tell you what, sir. Four pounds
dialog: ten - and I'll throw in The Times
dialog: and Telegraph... how's that?
scene_heading: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
dialog: Well, er... thank you very much.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: Let me wrap it for you, sir.
text: He puts it in a wrapper which says 'Educational Books'.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: Shall I put you on our mailing
dialog: list?
scene_heading: ELDERLY GENTLEMAN
dialog: Oh no! But I'll look in again...
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: By all means, sir.
text: He holds open the door for the Elderly Gentleman, and
text: watches him leave.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: He won't be doing the crossword
dialog: tonight!
text: He turns triumphantly to Mark.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: (counting out money
dialog: from wallet)
dialog: Those pictures he chose... were
dialog: all yours!
dialog: (handing notes)
dialog: This is yours!
text: Mark pockets them without counting them.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: (in a very different
dialog: tone)
dialog: And this is yours too...
text: He picks up a postcard - holds it towards Mark.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: And that's what I want to talk to
dialog: you about. It's a clever picture -
dialog: because you're a clever lad...
dialog: but, Mark...
dialog: (pathetically)
dialog: It's all face.
text: Mark looks at the postcard in silence.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: I don't want to hurt your feelings,
dialog: son - but if people want the Mona
dialog: Lisa they go to the National
dialog: Gallery.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The Louvre.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: Well, wherever they go, they don't
dialog: come here... so no more of this
dialog: fancy stuff...
text: He pats Mark's arm.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: ... now get upstairs - the girls
dialog: are waiting... and so is a bonus
dialog: if you give me what I want.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: (amused)
dialog: What do you do with all your money?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Buy cameras.
text: He opens a door at the far end of the room. We catch a
text: glimpse of a winding staircase. He starts to climb it.
scene_heading: INT. REAR OF NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY
text: At the top of the staircase is a door. Mark and his camera
text: trudge towards it. The door opens suddenly. A vivacious
text: young redhead - Milly - pokes her head round. She has a
text: towel round her shoulders.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Well look who's here! Cecil Beaton!
text: From REVERSE ANGLE WE SEE Mark venture a shy smile at Milly.
text: Milly opens the door impatiently.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Come on, sonny... make us famous.
text: Through the half-open door we catch a glimpse of a second
text: Girl (LORRAINE). She is staring out of a window, her back
text: to camera. She is naked except for a shawl draped round
text: her shoulders.
text: Mark enters the room... the door begins to close. CAMERA
text: TRACKS towards the door. On the threshold of the room, a
text: hood is thrown over our faces. THE SCREEN BLACKS OUT.
text: In the darkness WE HEAR Milly's voice.
speaker_heading: MILLY (O.S.)
dialog: Did you read about that girl who
dialog: was murdered last night?
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO ABOVE NEWSAGENT'S - DAY
text: We are with Mark under the hood of an antiquated camera.
text: Through the ground-glass of the camera WE SEE a SMALL
text: INVERTED IMAGE of Milly.
speaker_heading: MILLY (O.S.)
dialog: The same thing nearly happened to
dialog: me!
text: We hear Lorraine's voice - muffled, and very far away.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE (O.S.)
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: MILLY (O.S.)
dialog: Last night! I went out with my
dialog: boyfriend... We're getting married
dialog: next month... trouble was my fiance
dialog: saw us.
text: The SMALL INVERTED IMAGE of Milly peers anxiously into the
dialog: camera.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: can you fix it so the bruises don't
dialog: show?
text: The ground-glass camera begins travelling slowly down
text: Milly's back.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Milly. She is on a couch, lying on her stomach
text: at a slightly oblique angle. All that WE CAN SEE are her
text: face and naked shoulders.
text: From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark under the hood of an antiquated
dialog: camera.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Well, can you?
text: Mark's voice is MUFFLED under the hood.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ...think so, Milly.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Then be quick about it, sonny! I'm
dialog: freezing.
text: CLOSE SHOT of her naked toes. They start to wriggle.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark's toes - in sandals, next to the tripod
text: of the camera. They start to wriggle.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine. We watch her in profile as she
text: stares out of the window - clutching her shawl. She has
text: outstandingly beautiful features.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is standing by the side of the
text: camera, studying us thoughtfully. He is holding a remote-
text: control switch panel in his hand. He clicks off several
text: lights and then switches several others on... then he ducks
text: back under the hood.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: There he goes again! What have you
dialog: got under there? A girlfriend?
text: We join Mark under the hood.
text: WE SEE a small INVERTED IMAGE of Milly on the ground-glass.
text: Her shoulders are now white and glistening, her spine
text: caressed by shadows. She is staring into the camera.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: I suppose you have a girlfriend?
text: He adjusts the focus. We can see more clearly the contempt
text: on Milly's face.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, Milly.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Hear that, Lorraine? He's available.
text: From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark come round to the front of
text: the camera, and insert a dark slide.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Raise your head, please - and look
text: at the sea.
speaker_heading: MILLY (O.S.)
dialog: What sea?
text: Mark presses a rubber bulb - the shutter clicks.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: What sea?
text: Mark inserts another dark slide.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I just wanted that puzzled look.
speaker_heading: MILLY (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, did you? Well if you want it
dialog: again, I'll think of you!
scene_heading: CAMERA PULLS BACK
text: from Milly's viewpoint, WE SEE Mark holding the rubber
text: bulb. cine-camera is on a ledge behind him.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: You're a puzzle and a half.
text: Mark presses the rubber bulb - the shutters click.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: This is a spare time job for you,
dialog: isn't it?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, Milly.
text: He inserts another slide.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Well, what do you do for a living?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Take pictures.
text: He presses the bulb - the shutters click.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: This sort?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, Milly.
text: He inserts another slide.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Don't you like this sort?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, Milly.
text: He presses the bulb - the shutters click.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Well what sort do you like?
text: Mark looks at her thoughtfully for a long moment.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I may show you - one day.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: That'll be a treat, I'm sure.
text: Mark smiles at her shyly.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That's all, Milly.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Oh no, sonny! Now take one I can
dialog: show my mother.
text: Mark inserts another slide.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Think of her then.
text: There is a gentle KNOCK at the door, and Mr. Peters enters.
text: He carries a tray of coffee. He keeps his eyes modestly
dialog: lowered.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
text: On the house.
text: He lays the tray on a table, still keeping his eyes lowered,
text: and goes out.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Some house! Hope it falls on his
dialog: ruddy earhole!
text: She glances over her shoulder.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: It's your turn now, love...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine staring out of the window. She
text: stiffens. Milly's voice is overlaid.
speaker_heading: MILLY (O.S.)
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: ... it's her first time.
text: Lorraine clutches her shawl tightly.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Come on, love. Don't be shy.
text: Lorraine turns round.
text: The left side of her face is classical in its beauty. She
text: has a hare lip, which twists and distorts the whole of the
text: right side. Her eyes are large - and beautiful - and
text: defiant.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark looking at her.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: He said... you needn't photograph
dialog: my face!
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I want to.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine. Beautiful in profile.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: I suppose you'll fix my bruises
dialog: too?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I want to...
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: What about the customers?
text: CLOSE SHOT of the shawl round Lorraine's shoulders.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You needn't be shy... of me...
dialog: it's my first time too.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine's eyes - puzzled.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Yours?
speaker_heading: MARK
text: In front of eyes... like...
text: He tries to go on - but words are a foreign language to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ...eyes... as full of...
text: In a sudden rush:
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Lorraine - let my camera tell you.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine standing very still  looking at
text: him in silence.
text: Milly shrugs and reaches for the coffee pot.
text: Overlaid is the gentle purring of a cine-camera.
text: CAMERA LINGERS on the dark liquid being poured into a cup.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Whisky being poured into a glass.
scene_heading: CAMERA PULLS BACK
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING - TOWARDS SUNSET
text: The hand filling the glass is a woman's (MRS. STEPHENS).
text: She is sitting in a high-backed chair, and we cannot see
text: her face. Over her shoulder we watch a party in progress.
text: A group of Young people have surrounded someone to whom
text: they are singing:
speaker_heading: YOUNG PEOPLE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Happy birthday to you,
dialog: Happy birthday to you,
text: CAMERA TRACKS towards them.
text: CLOSE SHOT of TONY HUNTER, a well-built youngster in his
dialog: middle twenties.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Happy birthday... dear Helen
text: He obviously means it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: happy birthday to you.
text: CLOSE SHOT of 'dear HELEN'. A sensitive, intelligent, and
text: extremely attractive girl, who  as the encircling
dialog: youngsters now inform us in song - is:
speaker_heading: YOUNG PEOPLE
dialog: Twenty-one today,
dialog: She's twenty-one today,
text: She's got the key of the door,
dialog: She's never been twenty-one before.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the glass by Mrs. Stephens' side. It is half
text: empty. An elderly lady leans across to her. She is Mrs.
text: Partridge, slightly high on a glass of sherry.
scene_heading: MRS. PARTRIDGE
dialog: You must be very proud of your
dialog: daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
text: Mrs. Stephens grunts. Someone switches on a gramophone and
text: the young couples start dancing at once. Tony hurries up
dialog: to Helen.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: May I?
text: Helen goes towards him. A YOUNG MAN calls out sharply:
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Look!
text: He is pointing at something out of camera. All heads -
text: except Mrs. Stephens' - follow the direction of his gaze.
text: Mrs. Stephens continues to sit motionless in the high-backed
dialog: chair.
text: CAMERA PANS to the window. Mark is standing there.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at Mark. We watch him over her
text: shoulder - Tony's arm encircling it.
speaker_heading: TONY (O.S.)
dialog: It's that chap from upstairs.
scene_heading: EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - EVENING - LOW SUN
text: The chap from upstairs presses his face to the window.
text: From his POV WE SEE Helen's eyes looking at him - the key
text: of the door in them - looking at him, not staring. Suddenly
text: the rest comes into focus - Tony's arm around Helen's
text: shoulder... the high-backed chair in the foreground with
text: the back of that motionless head... a young couple giggling
text: as they stare at him. Mark steps away, and the CAMERA PULLS
text: BACK with him.
text: We catch a glimpse of the house - large, sprawling, but
text: with a touch of quality about it, in a quiet, unpretentious
dialog: street.
text: Mark hurries towards a side entrance.
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at the empty window.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'll ask him in...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Tony - frowning.
text: CAMERA PANS to Mrs. Stephens' glass... the hand which
text: refills it has begun to tremble.
scene_heading: INT. REAR OF HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The lights are on.
text: WE FOLLOW Mark (and his camera) along a small passage which
text: leads to the hall. The sound of a dance record can be heard.
text: Mark starts to whistle it under his breath.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - NIGHT
text: Over his shoulder we see a staircase, and beyond it the
text: door of Helen's sitting room. The sound of Helen's party
text: fills the hall.
text: Mark reaches the staircase. There is the sound of a door
text: opening. Helen's voice is overlaid:
speaker_heading: HELEN (O.S.)
dialog: Excuse me!
text: Mark hesitates, then turns round.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen - smiling at him.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I don't know how many times we've
dialog: passed each other on the stairs?
text: Mark looks at her as if he does.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... but tonight I'm determined at
dialog: least to say hello to you! So hello!
text: Her directness is natural, consistent and very hard to
dialog: resist.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - smiling.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm Helen Stephens.
text: She glances with unconcealed interest at the camera over
text: his shoulder.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm having a party - and the other
dialog: tenants are there... And a few
dialog: friends. We'd like you to join us.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Mark...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm Mark...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Hallo, Mark.
text: She holds out her hand... he takes it gently.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Please come in... you'll meet the
dialog: others who live here, and...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Thank you, but... work.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh...
text: She glances again at his camera.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, I hope to keep it going for
dialog: hours yet... so when you've finished
dialog: why not look in?
text: She realizes that this is not the happiest of phrases.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ...Mark?
text: He hesitates.
text: CAMERA PANS to Helen's door. Tony stands there.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Darling, your cake - everyone's
dialog: waiting.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - looking at her.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Thank you.
text: He turns away.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Happy Birthday.
text: He hurries up the stairs.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She stares after him for a moment.
text: Then returns thoughtfully to her party.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
text: The screen remains dark for a moment. We are with Mark in
text: a darkened room. He is giving a film show - and we are the
dialog: screen.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
text: His cine-projector points straight at us. A flickering
text: light shines in our eyes. We can see him crouching behind
text: the projector.
text: Mark leans forward, watching the screen intently...
text: Perspiration trickles down his forehead. He is breathing
text: very quickly. The sounds of the party seep up from
text: downstairs - music, laughter, and a Girl's yelp.
text: There is a knock on the door. Mark does not hear it.
text: CAMERA PANS to the door of the room. It is blacked-out
text: like a photographic dark-room. The knock is repeated.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He switches off the projector instantly.
text: CAMERA PANS to an open cupboard in the corner.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the shelves. They are stacked with spools of
dialog: film.
text: CAMERA travels slowly over these spools. WE SEE Mark's
text: hand add two more to the collection; his Voice is overlaid.
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: ...minute...
text: He closes the cupboard door.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Mark comes out of the dark-room behind him - the light is
text: kept out by a baffle and a curtain. He has a pleasant,
text: normally untidy bedsitting room.
text: He wipes his handkerchief across his forehead - then hurries
text: to the door. He opens it - Helen is standing there.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I hope I'm not disturbing you?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - shaking his head, smiling shyly.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I knew you wouldn't come down...
dialog: so I've brought you this.
text: She holds out a plate on which is a piece of birthday cake.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Thank you...
text: He takes the plate.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ... very much...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I mustn't keep you from your work
text: She turns to go.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'd like to offer you a drink.
text: She turns round.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thank you, Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I haven't one.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'd adore some water.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: a hostess can't drink water at her
text: own party, it looks like a hint to
dialog: the guests.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Will you... would you... like to
dialog: come in?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes, Mark...
text: She steps over the threshold. The door closes behind her.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round the room.
text: Mark's voice is overlaid.
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: There's milk... if you'd like some?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Very much... if you can spare it?
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Yes.
text: Helen glances towards the inner room. He holds out a glass
dialog: of milk to her.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thank you, Mark...
text: She drinks it with relish. He watches her in silence.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: This is a pleasant room... and
dialog: you've another inside?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: How long have you lived here?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: All my life.
text: She looks at him in surprise.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I was born in this house Oh?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's my father's.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Do you mean I've at last found out
dialog: who our landlord is? Your father?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well - no... he's dead!
text: He hesitates.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm the landlord.
text: She looks at him in astonishment.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: YOU?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: But you walk about as if you haven't
dialog: paid the rent.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I haven't.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I meant...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I know.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's his house - and I'll never
dialog: sell it... but I can't afford the
dialog: upkeep, so I let rooms.
text: He looks at her anxiously.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ... if I charge too much, tell me
dialog: and I'll tell the agents.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The rent's very reasonable, but
dialog: don't say anything to the others
dialog: or you'll have no peace.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Peace...?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark, what do you do?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Most of the time, I work in a film
dialog: studio.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: On the photographic side, I'll
dialog: bet.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I hope to be a film director...
dialog: very soon.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: How exciting.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I have some spare time jobs... as
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: To do with photography?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: More milk?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No thank you... to do with
dialog: photography?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes... to do with photography...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: When I came in were you looking at
dialog: some films?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Of yours?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'd like to see them...
text: He looks at her in silence.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Know I'm being rude... but I really
dialog: would like to see them...
dialog: (she smiles.)
dialog: ...it would be a birthday present...
dialog: from you to me.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Would it?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes, Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: But I suppose you're too busy?
text: She puts down the glass, turns to the door.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Will you... would you... like to
dialog: see them now?
text: She turns round. He is standing by the entrance to the
dialog: inner room.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thank you...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'll... go first.
text: He leads the way - she follows. For a moment the screen is
text: in darkness. A dark-room darkness.
scene_heading: INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT
text: We can HEAR - faintly  the dance music from downstairs.
text: There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in
text: diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement.
dialog: As certain events of possible interest are to take place
text: in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen.
text: The room is the product of three rooms which have been
text: knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well
dialog: constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a
text: laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing,
dialog: and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The
text: two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched
text: all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting
text: in the light.
text: In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a
text: 'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. There
text: are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of
text: equipment above the 'dry'.
text: This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning
text: in the ceiling above the benches.
text: The other part of the room has a window at the far end of
text: it. Heavy drapes are putted across it.
text: Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the
text: 16mm screen. Two banks of floods and a variety of spots
text: light this part of the room. There is a small control panel
text: on the wall.
text: Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old.
text: All of it glistens with the affection of its owner.
dialog: There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone
text: except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid
dialog: for it all.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel,
text: watching Helen.
text: From his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes
text: as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his.
text: For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a switch
text: on the wall. A gentle light ripples through the back of
text: Helen's hair.
text: SHOT of Helen. She turns to him. She is very nearly at a
dialog: loss for words.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: This is so... well - so many
dialog: things... but above all - it's
dialog: so...
text: She takes a final look round.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ...completely unexpected!
text: She looks at him searchingly.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Is all of it yours?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I mean... is it designed by you?
dialog: Furnished by you? Tell me about
dialog: this room.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It belonged to my father
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What was he?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Scientist...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Then this equipment was his?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No...
text: He hesitates.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sold his to buy it...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: But it seems to be so... technical.
text: She looks at him with renewed interest.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: If this is where you work, I can't
dialog: wait to see what you work at.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - in difficulties.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Don't know what to show you?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well... what were you looking at
dialog: when I interrupted you?
text: He looks at her thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: All right!
text: He crosses to the corner cupboard - opens the door.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the cupboard. WE SEE Mark's hand reach for
text: a spool of film... then hesitate, poised above another
dialog: spool.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching with interest.
text: REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mark. He closes the cupboard, and
text: turns round... there is a spool of film in his hand.
text: He walks slowly towards his projector... he seems  for
text: the moment  to have forgotten she is there.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching him thread the film into
text: the projector.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: This is the first... twenty-first
dialog: birthday present... I'll ever have
dialog: given.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It's the first I've ever asked
dialog: for...
text: He places a chair a few feet away from the screen - and,
text: with an oddly courteous bow, beckons her into it. She sits
dialog: down.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks at her intently for a moment -
text: then turns off the lights. Over Helen's shoulder We can
text: just make out the empty screen. Mark switches on the
text: projector.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen - the light flickering on her face.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at Helen's face.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen. WE SEE her expression of surprise.
text: Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE the surprise growing. Over
text: Helen's shoulder we see the screen. We are looking at a
text: small boy. He is lying in his bed asleep. Although the
text: print is old, we can see that he is a remarkably handsome
dialog: boy.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark, what a beautiful child.
text: The boy turns restlessly in his sleep... one of his pillows
text: falls to the floor.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Me
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Of course it is! Then who took
dialog: this film?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: My Father.
text: A light - as if from a small torch  starts to shine on
text: the child's eyes. He moves restlessly.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What a wonderful idea...
text: The light plays on the child's left eye, then on his right.
text: It is growing brighter.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You'll be able to show it to your
dialog: own chi...
text: The child wakes up suddenly. He stares at something...
text: then starts to scream.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You must have had a bad dream...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching her in silence.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ...but what was that light? ...The
dialog: camera, I suppose?
text: Mark does not answer. The small screen is filled with the
text: face of the screaming, terrified child.
dialog: (Mark's father now tries a not altogether successful
dialog: dissolve:)
text: WE NOW SEE the little boy standing in front of a garden
text: wall. He tries hard to climb to the top of the wall, but
text: falls over. Helen laughs. Mark watches her in silence.
text: Small Mark tries again - and again - to scale the wall...
text: At last he succeeds.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Whatever are you after?
text: WE SEE the little boy lying flat on the wall staring at
text: something... rapt, motionless.
text: The cine-camera which is taking this picture now tracks
text: rather clumsily towards the wall.
text: HIGH ANGLE SHOT over the wall of what is fascinating young
text: Mark - A man and woman are lying on the ground, kissing.
text: The CINE-CAMERA PANS - again rather clumsily - to young
text: Mark... staring intently.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Naughty boy I hope you were spanked!
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen. It suddenly occurs to her.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... but, Mark... what a strange
dialog: thing for your father to photograph.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Switch off?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No.
text: She stares again at that lonely figure perched on the wall.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No.
text: The small screen begins to dissolve ...so does the large
dialog: one.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Over Mrs. Stephens' shoulder WE SEE the party in progress.
text: The glass by her side is full again. Tony is dancing with
text: an attractive blonde.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Tony!
text: He turns round.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Me, Mrs. Stephens?
text: The head nods.
text: Tony advances reluctantly towards her.
text: REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens.
text: Over Tony's shoulder WE SEE a powerfully built and once
dialog: lovely woman.
text: She is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober. The few
text: movements she makes are slow - deliberate - and give nothing
text: away. The voice articulates so carefully that the slur
dialog: scarcely shows.
text: The fact that she is blind almost helps to conceal the
text: fact that she is drunk. Her sightless eyes stare out the
text: camera as Tony reaches her.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: I want a word with you.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen's eyes. The light from the projector
text: flickering into them.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I hate people who chatter in films -
dialog: but there's so much I want to ask.
scene_heading: CAMERA PULLS BACK
scene_heading: INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT
text: She is leaning forward, her face cupped in her hand,
text: watching the small screen intently.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. His face is cupped in his hand as he
text: watches her intently.
text: Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE Mark in the making.
text: The child is again asleep... this time he is being
text: photographed from the head of the bed - the CAMERA POINTING
text: STRAIGHT DOWN AT HIS FACE.
text: A beam of light starts to shine onto his eyes, first onto
text: the left, then onto the right.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: Again?
text: Mark looks at her in silence.
text: The boy moves restlessly, then turns over onto his face,
text: pulling the bedclothes round him. His right hand is limp
text: on the pillow. The light shines for a moment on this hand,
text: then goes out. Helen half turns towards Mark.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark, this isn't some kind of jo...
text: Her attention is suddenly riveted on the screen.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: No, Helen.
text: Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE something drop onto the child's
text: bed... something which stays quite still for a moment,
text: then starts crawling towards the counterpane. It is a small
dialog: lizard.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark, whatever is that?
text: Her voice trails away. She stares - repelled and fascinated -
text: at the screen.
text: WE SEE Mark reach for his cine-camera.
text: Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE the lizard reach the
text: counterpane. It stretches itself out on the floral design -
text: its body is pointed towards the child's hand.
text: WE HEAR a click - and suddenly a spotlight falls onto
text: Helen's face.
text: OVERLAID is the GENTLE PURRING of Mark's cine-camera. She
text: wheels towards him - blotting out the small screen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What are you...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: wanted to photograph you...
dialog: watching...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No, Mark!
text: The camera purrs on.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No!
text: He switches off the spot... the purring of the camera dies
text: away. She turns towards the small screen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: help me to understand this... this
dialog: nightmare...
text: The small boy is sitting upright... screaming with terror...
text: there is no sign of the lizard.
text: A handkerchief is thrown onto the boy's bed. He continues
text: crying - looking up into someone's face.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching the screen.
text: We hear a man's deep voice overlaid.
speaker_heading: MAN'S DEEP VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: That'll do Mark... dry your eyes
dialog: and stop being silly.
text: Small Mark reaches for the handkerchief and wipes his
text: eyes... his hands are trembling.
text: The small screen trembles with them into a clumsy dissolve.
text: Helen turns to Mark.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: All right... now look... Mark -
dialog: what was all that about?
text: He looks at her helplessly.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... that was a lizard, wasn't it?
dialog: Or a...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Liz...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well how did it get there?... How
dialog: did it get there Mark?... Was it
dialog: a pet?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Not mine...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Won't you try to explain?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at the screen.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You'd better go!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I like to understand what I'm shown!
text: She turns to the screen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What was your father trying to
dialog: do?... Photographing you at nigh...
text: Her voice trails away.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: better go...
text: From Helen's POV WE SEE the screen.
text: Small Mark is wearing a dark suit and a black tie.
text: He is standing at the foot of a four-poster bed, staring
text: at something in horror and disbelief... his hands clasp
text: the bedrail tightly.
text: Slowly - very slowly - he walks towards the head of the
text: bed, staring.
text: His lips begin to quiver. He bends forward over the bed.
text: WE CAN SEE the back of his bowed head.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark... what is this?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I am saying... goodbye... my
dialog: mother...
text: We catch a glimpse of a woman's hands folded in front of
dialog: her.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: He... photographed... that...?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
text: Suddenly - and healthily - his temper snaps.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ...and this!
text: He pushes a lever on his projector as far forward as it
dialog: will go.
text: The film is now shown at tremendous speed - We catch a
text: glimpse of a long line of cars.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ...her funeral!
text: It speeds by.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ...and this!
text: A confused picture of earth and flowers.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ...her burial!
text: The briefest glimpse of a little boy with a spade.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ...and this!
text: WE SEE a girl in a bikini by sand-dunes. Mark offers no
dialog: comment.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark, who is that?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Her successor.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Suc-?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He married her... six weeks after...
dialog: the previous sequence.
text: He pulls back the lever of his projector... the film returns
dialog: to its normal speed.
text: WE SEE the same attractive young woman standing in a garden.
text: She is holding a bewildered and defiant Mark by the hand.
text: Suddenly the girl runs towards camera - leaving Mark
text: standing alone.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: She filmed... what comes now.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen watching intently. It's out of focus!
text: From Helen's POV WE SEE a tall man in a black coat walking
text: away from camera. He hurries towards small Mark - who
text: watches him anxiously.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Is that your father?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The morning that he left for his
dialog: honeymoon.
text: The back of Mark's father suddenly obscures our view of
text: small Mark... all we can see is that tall figure looking
text: downwards standing very still.
text: Camera wobbles - as if the person holding it is laughing.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What is he doing?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Giving me a present...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What was it?
text: Mark stares at the blurred screen, perspiration trickling
text: down his forehead.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Can't you guess?
text: The small screen comes back into focus - and suddenly our
text: camera rushes towards it.
text: WE SEE a CLOSE SHOT of a CLOSE SHOT - and at the moment we
text: see it, Mark's Voice is overlaid... A whisper which echoes
text: round the room.
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: A camera...
text: We are looking at a close shot of a camera in a small boy's
dialog: hands.
text: There is a single shrill chord of music on the sound track.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the shelf which encircles Mark's room.
text: We are looking at the very same camera which the small boy
text: is holding.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the camera in small Mark's hands.
text: His father's finger points lo the view-finder.
text: Small Mark stares into it. Small Mark begins to smile.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching himself being born.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen watching Mark.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Switch it off!
text: He continues to stare at the screen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Switch it off, Mark!
text: She turns to the projector - touches the wrong switch.
text: Small Mark and his father go rapidly backwards.
text: Mark turns off the projector abruptly.
text: The room is in darkness.
text: WE CAN HEAR both of them breathing quickly.
text: The light goes on. Mark is standing by the exit - he keeps
text: his face averted.
text: Helen walks slowly towards the exit. She glances round
text: once, over her shoulder, then goes into the other room.
text: Mark stares after her.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: She walks towards the door... turns round suddenly - almost
dialog: in anger.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: So he was a scientist?
text: He keeps his face averted.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What kind of scientist, Mark?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Biologist.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What was he trying to do to you?
text: He doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark!...
text: He turns round slowly. From his POV WE SEE the willingness
text: to understand on her face.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What was he trying to do to you?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Watch me... grow up...
text: She walks towards him... takes his handkerchief from his
text: jacket pocket and wipes his forehead.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He wanted a record of a growing
dialog: child... complete in every detail -
dialog: if such a thing were possible -
dialog: and he tried to make it possible
dialog: by training a camera on me... at
dialog: all times...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I never knew... the whole of my
dialog: childhood... one moment's privacy...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: And those lights in your eyes?...
dialog: and that - thing?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He was interested ... in the
dialog: reactions of the nervous system...
dialog: to fear... Fear?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Fear?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Fear.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the word 'fear'.
scene_heading: CAMERA PULLS BACK
text: We are looking at the spine of a book on Mark's shelf. The
dialog: full title reads: The Physiology of Fear by Professor A.
dialog: N. Lewis.
scene_heading: MARK'S VOICE IS OVERLAID:
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Especially fear in children - and
dialog: how they react to it.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the word 'fear' on the next book.
scene_heading: CAMERA PULLS BACK
scene_heading: The full title reads: FEAR AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, PART I.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR A. N. LEWIS. There is a row of such books all
dialog: by Professor Lewis.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I think he learned a lot... from
dialog: me... I'd wake up... screaming...
dialog: sometimes... and he'd be there...
dialog: taking notes... and pictures...
dialog: and I'm sure good came of it...
dialog: for some people... He was brilliant.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: A scientist drops a lizard onto a
dialog: child's bed - and good comes of
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't know... if he did... but
dialog: if he did... he'll have learned
dialog: something of value...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: If only about lizards! Mark - it
dialog: sounds to me as if your father
dialog: was...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He founded clinics.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: He sounds completely...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He was famous! Professor A. N.
dialog: Lewis... three clinics.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Why do you still live in his
dialog: house... and watch his films?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They helped make me... what I am.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: A photographer? It's no wonder, is
dialog: it? But you still haven't shown me
dialog: anything you've photographed!
text: He looks at her in silence.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Will you?
text: There is a knock on the door.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: One day...
text: He hurries to the door, and opens it.
text: Tony is standing there.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Excuse me, but...
text: From Tony's POV WE SEE Helen looking at the door of the
text: dark room.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Oh, there you are, Helen.
text: She turns towards him.
speaker_heading: TONY
text: The party looks like breaking up,
dialog: and we were wondering if...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm coming.
text: She turns to Mark.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I wish you'd join us.
text: Mark shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Thanks... work.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I hope that you...
text: She is suddenly aware of Tony watching her. She glances at
text: the birthday cake on the table.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... have a sweet tooth!
text: She smiles at him.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thank you... for my present.
text: She goes into the passage.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Good night, old boy.
text: He puts his arm round Helen, and closes the door.
text: Mark stares after them, motionless.
text: The CAMERA LINGERS on the birthday cake.
text: As the light fades, a voice yells: Cut!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FILM STUDIO - DAY
text: HIGH ANGLE SHOT of a set showing part of a large West End
dialog: store.
text: A blonde is lying unconscious in front of a lift - and a
text: crowd of extras surround her.
text: As the word 'cut' dies away, the extras relax - and the
text: blonde (DIANE ASHLEY) props herself onto her elbow, looking
text: towards the Director.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the Director (ARTHUR BADEN) standing beside
dialog: the camera.
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: OK. Print that one!

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You'll then print the film - so I

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Mark...

speaker_heading: VIVIAN

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EXTRA
dialog: Thought I saw you talking to

speaker_heading: VIVIAN

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Something... that has never been
dialog: photographed before.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You really want to know...?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Very much, especially if there's a
dialog: part for me.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I want... to photograph a murder...
text: while it's being committed.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: No part for me then.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: But that... isn't enough.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Is this a new script?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I want... to frighten... someone...

speaker_heading: VIVIAN

speaker_heading: VIVIAN

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: VIVIAN

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I wouldn't care... if I had my

speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Besides, how would you frighten
dialog: anyone to death?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: There's a way.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Well, what?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: There's a way.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: You'd better not tell me! I'll be

speaker_heading: VIVIAN

speaker_heading: VIVIAN

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: BADEN

dialog: to read the script...
text: She ignores this.
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: ... may I remind you that you're a

speaker_heading: JARVIS
dialog: Are those budgets ready? Well bring
dialog: 'em in.
text: He replaces this receiver and picks up the original.

dialog: part for Kenny or Alec'...
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S. FILTERED)
dialog: Send me a memo - we'll discuss it
dialog: next week.

text: CLOSE SHOT of Mr. Jarvis opening a folder.
text: Over his shoulder WE SEE a page covered with row upon row
dialog: of figures.
text: The great man's finger skims along the figures like a tailor
text: feeling cloth.
speaker_heading: JARVIS
dialog: There's an error! The total should
dialog: be a hundred and fifty thousand
dialog: pounds fourteen shillings and
dialog: sixpence - not thirteen and
dialog: ninepence... That could mean the
dialog: difference between profit and loss
dialog: on a first feature!
speaker_heading: MISS SIMPSON
dialog: Sorry, D.J.
text: He glowers at her - but his day is made.
speaker_heading: JARVIS

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: VIVIAN

speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Oh! He'd say:

dialog: man's voice)
dialog: Sign on the dotted line, kiddies!
dialog: You can use my pen, but bring your
dialog: own ink!
dialog: (her excitement is
dialog: growing)
dialog: Mark... if you're sure it's worth
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's time to find out, Viv...
text: He walks slowly towards the studio camera.
text: She prepares for the test by switching on music and warming
text: up with dance movements.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Come on! Get hot!
dialog: (she accents the
dialog: rhythm)
text: Mark puts the cine-camera and the black cloth bag on the
text: dolly, slowly mounts the platform, closes the blimp - and
text: swings the camera.
text: We watch him from the top of the studio, from the door of
text: the studio, from the Director's chair. And finally WE WATCH
text: HIM from Vivian's POV. She stops dancing but the music
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You belong there...
text: He stares ahead of him, his mind far, far away... then
text: bends and looks into the finder.
text: There is a single harsh chord of music - and the screen
text: goes dark. It remains dark for a moment.
text: Suddenly the darkness parts like curtains - and in the
text: centre WE SEE Vivian's face in the finder of the studio
text: camera. (Unlike the ground-glass of the newsagent's camera,
dialog: we see everything the right way up and in perfect
dialog: perspective.)
text: Mark hooks a filler-light below the camera and switches it
text: on. He adjusts the finder until he has made of Vivian's
text: delicate features a radiant miniature.
text: The miniature smiles shyly at him. She has stopped dancing
text: and is looking directly at the camera. Music continues.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I do feel alone in front of it...
dialog: (she hesitates)
dialog: I suppose stars never do?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They feel alone without it...
dialog: (he looks in the
dialog: eyepiece)
text: Through the film, we can see only her eyes - large and
dialog: wistful.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ... and the great ones... feel
dialog: alone... all the time...
text: She becomes the uninhibited Vivian again.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Then I'm great, boy! What is it
dialog: you want me to act?
dialog: (she strikes an
dialog: attitude a, la
dialog: Rabbins)
text: He looks up from the camera; she smiles and starts keeping
text: time to the rhythm again.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Being frightened to death?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You remembered?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yes - and I'll have a go!
text: We hear his quick breathing.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I've been wondering all the
dialog: afternoon how you'd do it! I'll
dialog: bet you've thought of a wonderful
dialog: twist!
dialog: (she does a wonderful
dialog: twist)
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks down - a little sadly - and
text: peers into the finder. (The camera dolly is on tracks - he
dialog: tracks forward.)
text: Music continues - piano.
text: In the finder WE SEE a large trunk - 'at greatly reduced
text: prices'  on the shelf behind Vivian.
text: From Vivian's POV WE SEE Mark leave the studio camera 
text: and hurry towards the trunks. She watches him wide-eyed.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Building us a set.
text: He reaches for the largest trunk.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Why not pull the studio down while
dialog: you're about it? They can only
dialog: hang you once.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Exactly.
text: He carries the trunk towards the studio camera, and lays

text: Music continues.
text: Vivian peers into the front-glass of the studio camera 
text: as if it were a mirror. The rhythm of the music changes.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: If only Don Jarvis could see me
dialog: now!
text: She jumps onto the trunk and taps.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: If only I could see Don Jarvis
dialog: now!
text: She giggles again.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I warn you, Mark - I'm hysterical...
dialog: I'd rather act dying of laughter,
dialog: if it's all the same to you...
text: She jumps off the trunk onto the floor.
text: He opens the trunk. she jumps into it. Her laughter echoes
text: round the deserted studio.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. POWER HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
text: The two electricians are roaring with laughter. One of
text: them is making tea.
speaker_heading: 1ST ELECTRICIAN
dialog: So he did it again! Now you tell
dialog: one.
text: CAMERA PANS to a dial on the wall... one of the needles
text: flickers slightly.
speaker_heading: 2ND ELECTRICIAN
dialog: Half a mo...
speaker_heading: 1ST ELECTRICIAN (O.S.)
dialog: One lump or two?
speaker_heading: 2ND ELECTRICIAN
dialog: As the starlet said to the casting
dialog: director...
text: He turns away from the dials, and grasps at the outstretched
dialog: mug.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: CLOSE SHOT of Vivian recording - her little recorder is
text: twittering back at great speed.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (to Mark, over her
dialog: shoulder)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: She restarts music.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING
text: She is watching Mark curiously as he arranges the lighting.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Be patient, Viv... it's going to
dialog: be worth it.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the studio camera. In front of it - fixed on
text: a small hook - is a tape measure.
text: Mark reaches for it... then carefully measures the distance
text: between the trunk and the camera... then he takes apiece
text: of chalk from his pocket and makes a small cross on the
dialog: floor.
text: The music continues.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Oh well! I've stood alone in front
dialog: of a studio camera! That's more
dialog: than most have.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Ever stood... behind one?
text: He glances at a nearby dial - only a few feet away from
text: the one which is flickering.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Help yourself.
text: She goes around the camera out of sight - and he is out of
text: hers. He glances into the trunk - it is deep, and very
text: empty.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (accenting the rhythm)
dialog: I can see you, Mark... perfectly!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Good...
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yes, sir! I'll bet I'm the best
dialog: camerawoman in the business! . . .
dialog: (beating time with
dialog: her feet)
text: Mark hurries to the side of the studio camera and picks up
text: his cine-camera.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN (O.S.)
dialog: I've lost you!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'll be back.
text: Suddenly Mark's face appears in the finder.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Welcome, stranger!
text: We see Mark raise his cine-camera. He seems to be pointing
text: it straight at us. We hear a gentle purring.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Photographing you photographing
dialog: me...
text: High angle shot of Mark standing in front of the studio
text: camera - photographing her photographing him.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (in mock awe)
dialog: Mark, you're brilliant...
text: He walks slowly towards her, holding his cine-camera to
text: his eyes. In the finder of Mark's cine-camera WE SEE Vivian
text: at the studio camera. She comes closer and closer.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Lost you again!
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Never mind.
text: We see him standing almost on top of her - his cine-camera
text: trained on her.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm ready now, Viv...
text: She looks up slowly - and a little hesitantly. Music, all
dialog: drums.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Go and stand on that cross, will
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (solemnly)
dialog: Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
text: He watches her in silence as she walks to the front of the
text: studio camera and takes up her position. while the drum-
text: beat continues.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING
text: Don Jarvis is leaving the unit working on the lot. It is
text: now bustling with activity.
text: A girl comes up to him... She raises her cigarette for a
text: light - and looks into his eyes.
text: He hands her a box of matches... and walks away. Over his
text: shoulder we see the other stages - apparently empty. Don
text: Jarvis hesitates, then strides towards one.
scene_heading: INT. POWER HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
text: CLOSE SHOT of a dial - the needle flickering slightly.
text: Overlaid is the voice of the 1st Electrician.
speaker_heading: 1ST ELECTRICIAN (O.S.)
dialog: ...and here's one of the wife and
dialog: nipper...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING
text: CLOSE SHOT of Vivian staring at the trunk on the floor
text: behind her. The recorded rhythm continues.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Am I supposed to imagine someone
dialog: is going to put me in there?
text: Mark is watching her over the top of the studio camera.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, Viv...
text: He peers into the viewfinder. In the finder we see Vivian
text: looking rather pathetically into camera.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Mark - I hope I won't let you
dialog: down... I know you're trying to
dialog: create atmosphere for me - but...
dialog: I just don't feel frightened!
dialog: Wouldn't it be better if I just
dialog: did my number?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (shaking head)
dialog: Later.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Oh all right! I could do anything -
dialog: I feel so relaxed - and that's due
dialog: to you... You're so at home with
dialog: that camera you make me feel at
dialog: home too... you have it in you,
dialog: boy!
text: From her POV WE SEE see him raise his head slightly.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Ready, Viv?
speaker_heading: MARK VIVIAN
dialog: (great effort)
dialog: Well-I'll try -
text: In the finder we see her wrinkling her brow.
speaker_heading: MARK VIVIAN
dialog: But what... would... frighten me
dialog: to death?
dialog: (looking appealingly
dialog: into camera)
dialog: Set the mood for me, Mark...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well...
text: He goes and switches off the recorder. The sudden silence
dialog: is startling.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Imagine someone... coming towards
dialog: you... who's going to kill you -
dialog: regardless of consequences...
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: A madman?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes - but he knows it... and you
dialog: don't... and just to kill you...
dialog: isn't enough for him.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: But how would he frighten me to?
text: She stares into focusing screen - intrigued, but not
text: frightened, not even by the silence and shadowy vastness
text: around her.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Stay there, Viv... you're... just
dialog: right.
text: She stands motionless - staring into camera.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR IN STUDIO - EARLY EVENING
text: CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis. He is standing motionless, staring
text: down a corridor.
text: What he is staring at is out of camera - and it is puzzling
dialog: the great man.
text: He walks quietly along the corridor.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Vivian.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: I can't imagine what you've thought
dialog: of!
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He raises his head slowly - and locks
text: the studio camera off. Then he walks slowly towards her.
text: HIGH ANGLE SHOT of Mark walking towards Vivian.
text: CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN to the trunk behind her. Mark's voice is
dialog: overlaid:
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Suppose this... were one of his
dialog: weapons...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING
text: The great man is poised for the kill. He is moving forward
text: stealthily... and suddenly breaks into a run.
text: CAMERA PANS - and WE SEE the object of his attentions. A
text: wisp of smoke is coming from behind an alcove.
text: CLOSE SHOT of a Fireman - smoking a cigarette.
dialog: CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis - smoking!
text: CLOSE SHOT of the Fireman's terror as he sees Don Jarvis.
speaker_heading: JARVIS
dialog: Smoking on duty!
text: The Fireman opens his mouth to explain  and smoke exudes.
speaker_heading: JARVIS
dialog: Come with me!
text: The Fireman follows him meekly.
scene_heading: CAMERA PANS.
text: So near - yet a lifetime away - a red light is burning
text: above a closed door.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Vivian - puzzled.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: That..?
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO E. - EARLY EVENING
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
text: He is holding his cine-camera; fixed to it is a collapsible
dialog: tripod.
text: Suddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out. WE SEE that a
text: very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it.
text: From Mark's POV WE SEE Vivian looking at the spike.
text: He raises it towards her - until the spike is only inches
text: from her throat.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Yes... that would be frightening!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: But... there's something else...
text: We can hear his heart pounding as if it will burst - and
text: gradually Vivian, too, becomes aware of it.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: Well? What is it?
text: Just for a moment Mark's arm moves. His back hides what he
text: is doing. Suddenly WE SEE Vivian turn her head sharply -
text: she is looking at something out of camera.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: That...?
text: The spike is very close to her throat - but Vivian ignores
text: it, staring out of camera.
text: Over Mark's shoulder we concentrate on Vivian's face.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: Mark... take it...
text: The fear on her face is rapidly growing...
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: ... away!
text: She tries to move back - but the trunk prevents her.
speaker_heading: VIVIAN
dialog: MARK - YOU!
text: It is almost a scream.
text: We can hear Mark breathing quickly.
text: Vivian raises her hands to push something away from her.
text: Suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes. WE SEE them
text: dilating with terror. There is a sudden crash as the big
text: power switches go out in the roof.
text: The lights go out.
text: There is a scream in the darkness.
text: Then silence.
text: The darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is
text: seeing the world through a curtain - it is the world of
dialog: Mrs. Stephens.
text: A bright light is felt, rather than seen, beating against
text: our eyelids. It looms closer and stronger.
speaker_heading: HELEN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: And that, darling, is the end of
dialog: the news! Unless you want the
dialog: football results?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens, a large glass of whisky - and
text: the bottle - beside her. It is night.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: No thank you.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen. 'She's Got the Key of the Door' is
text: overlaid.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What else can I read you?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: The label on this whisky bottle!
dialog: Are you sure it says seventy per
dialog: cent proof?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Certain.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: They're bigger liars than the press!
text: From Helen's POV WE SEE her reach for her glass with a
text: steady hand.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Is that your last tonight?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: I doubt it.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Your last but one?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Don't haggle.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (producing a coin)
dialog: Toss me double or nothing?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Done!
text: Helen spins the coin on the table Mrs. Stephens listens
text: intently... the coin stops spinning.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Heads.
text: Her fingers shoot out and feel the surface of the coin.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Bad luck, darling.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Huh.
text: She turns the coin over and carefully feels the other side.
text: Helen watches her with a smile - then looks thoughtfully
text: at the ceiling.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: What are you looking at?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The ceiling!
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Wondering if that young man is
dialog: home?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Well he is... I heard him come
dialog: in... four paragraphs ago.
text: From Helen's POV WE SEE the sightless eyes staring at her.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Do you like him?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes, darling.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: He has a quality...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: (sipping her glass)
dialog: Wish this had.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... and I think he could help me.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: With your photographs?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Helen...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes?
text: Mrs. Stephens hesitates - which is rare.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: (abruptly)
dialog: It doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Mummy, what's worrying you?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: The price of whisky.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What else?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: What else matters?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Don't you like Mark?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Haven't met him.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You don't like him! Now why not?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Again she hesitates.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
text: I distrust a man who walks quietly.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: He's shy!
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: His footsteps aren't! They're
dialog: stealthy...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Now darling.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Are you going up to him?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: May I?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: We both have the key of the door...
dialog: Mine needs oiling - and yours needs
dialog: exercise... Off you go.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thank you.
text: She kisses her - and glances at the whisky glass.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: remember that you lost the toss.
text: She walks to the door.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Helen...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes, darling?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: If you're back in five minutes...
dialog: I won't even finish this.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Done!
text: She hurries out. Mrs. Stephens instantly refills her glass.
text: CLOSE SHOT of her hand. It has begun to tremble.
scene_heading: MARK'S DARK-ROOM
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hands, in the green light of the dark-
text: room. He is busy unloading and winding film onto a
text: developing rack.
text: He puts the rack of exposed film into the tank and starts
dialog: the time clock.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the time clock ticking.
text: A knock is heard off.
text: Mark looks up.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: HELEN (O.S.)
dialog: Helen...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. Faintly overlaid is 'She's Got the
text: Key of the Door'. He looks down at the clock.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Come in, Helen!
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGE - EVENING
text: Helen opens the door of Mark's sitting room. We hear Mark
text: call out from the inner room:
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Would you... please... wait in
dialog: there?... Developing.
text: Helen goes in, closing the door behind her.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING
text: Helen enters. She speaks loudly to be heard in the dark-
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mother heard you come in - so I
dialog: guessed you wouldn't be in bed ...
text: No reply from the inner room.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Are you sure this is conven...
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Won't be long!
text: Helen glances at her watch... then looks curiously round
dialog: the room.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Vivian's recorder, placed on a chair.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She picks it up and looks at it,
text: curiously, fingering the stops.
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Hallo.
text: Helen turns round. Mark is standing on the threshold of
text: the dark-room.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Hallo, Mark...
text: He walks towards her... he stops suddenly. He is staring
text: at the recorder in her hand.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I hope you don't mind - is it a
dialog: tape-recorder?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
text: Gently he takes it from her - as if it is a cup with which
text: she has finished - and replaces it on the shelf.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm sure I'm being a nuisance...
dialog: but, Mark, I very much want to...
text: Her voice trails away.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is holding out a small package.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Happy birthday.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark! That's very sweet of you -
dialog: but really.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It isn't much... I don't know
dialog: anything about... presents for
dialog: twenty-one... but I saw it this
dialog: morning... so... please.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Thank you...
text: She takes the package, and unwraps it. Inside is a slender
dialog: brooch
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It's beautiful...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I like the design... More milk?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: More?... No, thank you, Mark...
dialog: and I really appreciate this...
dialog: I'm going to put it on now.
text: He watches her hold it against her dress.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: There?... Or there?...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The first place...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I think so too!...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen pinning it on.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark touching his lapel.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen glancing at her watch.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark glancing at his. He thinks of the ticking
text: clock in the dark-room.
text: Helen looks up, and sees him.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I am keeping you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No... I promise.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark, I'm here for some advice.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: From me? Please...
text: He looks as if he has just been voted the best cameraman
dialog: of the year (unanimously) - and the two films he directed
dialog: have both won Oscars (though Don Jarvis understood them).
text: His delighted astonishment is such that she has to smile.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... I work in a public library -
dialog: in the children's section... I'm
dialog: telling you that to postpone
dialog: admitting what always embarrasses
dialog: me...
text: She takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: In my spare time... I write.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What's embar...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I write stories for children...
dialog: but so did Grimm... Hans Andersen...
dialog: Lewis Carroll...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Had any published?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Some short stories.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'd like to read...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I learned today... that my first
dialog: book... has been accepted! ... For
dialog: publication in the spring...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: But that's wonderful... what's it
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: A magic camera - and what it
dialog: photographs...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Whatever made you... think of that?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'll tell you one day - I promise...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well what does it photograph?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'll tell you that too - but,
dialog: Mark... this is the problem... The
dialog: children who read the book will
dialog: want to see the pictures the camera
dialog: takes - but the publishers say
dialog: they're impossible to photograph,
dialog: and suggest drawings... but I don't
dialog: agree.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No - nothing's impossible.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: was hoping you'd say that! There
dialog: must be photographs - however
dialog: difficult to take - and I was
dialog: wondering, Mark - if you'd...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh yes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: discuss it with me.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: take them.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark - I can't ask you to do that...
dialog: They have cancelled his Oscar.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I mean... the publisher's mightn't
dialog: agree.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'd take them... for you.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes but... the money.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: There are some things... which I
dialog: photograph... for nothing.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I didn't mean to offend you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Offend?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Helen... if you knew what it
dialog: meant... for something to happen
dialog: to me... that I don't have to make
dialog: happen... it's like... you've given
dialog: me a twenty-first birthday...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at him...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What does your camera photograph?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark - I must go... I just wanted
dialog: to know... if you'd talk it over
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: When please?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That's up to you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Helen ... I don't know much about...
dialog: dinner out... but would you come
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It had better be soon...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Are you going away?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Almost for certain! ...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh... well you suggest when.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Are you free... tomorrow night?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I hope I am!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'll understand if you're not.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'll try to be - I'll try my hardest
dialog: to be.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thank you for listening... and for
dialog: my present.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: and for mine.
text: They look at each other in silence.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Good night, Mark...
dialog: (turning to the
dialog: door)
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Good night... Helen...
text: He watches her leave, standing very still.
text: Offstage, the time clock explodes.
text: CLOSE SHOT - the excited clock. Mark's hand silences it.
scene_heading: INT. DARK-ROOM - GREEN LIGHT
text: Mark opens the developing tank, lifts out the rack of film,
text: drops it into the fixing bath.
text: He switches light from green to red.
text: CLOSE SHOT - green to red dark-room lamp.
text: Mark lifts the rack of glistening film out of the fixing
text: bath and scans the image.
text: CLOSE SHOT - Mark's face and the tell-tale black and white
dialog: images.
text: CLOSE SHOT - the film. A pile of trunks.
text: In the darkness we hear a man enquire softly:
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Looking for a trunk?
text: CLOSE SHOT of a Tall Man with a severe face. He is standing
text: in front of a familiar pile of trunks marked at 'Specially
dialog: Reduced Prices'.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY - and WE SEE whom he is addressing.
dialog: It is Diane.
text: CAMERA PULLS FURTHER BACK and WE SEE that we are in a small
text: theatre watching rushes...
scene_heading: INT. THEATRE IN STUDIO - DAY
text: CAMERA PANS across Baden's disgruntled face... the Chief
text: Cameraman's bored face... the Script Girl's puzzled face...
text: to Diane's expression of rapture as she watches herself on
text: the screen.
speaker_heading: DIANE (O.S.)
dialog: I'd like to see that one.
text: From Diane's POV WE WATCH the screen. We see the Tall Man
text: (SHOP ASSISTANT) reaching for a trunk and laying it on the
text: counter. He opens it with a flourish. Vivian passes across
text: the screen - glances casually at the trunk - and wanders
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: No - no - no - we must get some
dialog: comedy into this...!
text: The Assistant Director nods.
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: We'll retake it this morning...
text: CAMERA LINGERS for a moment on the screen as Diane (on-
text: screen) smiles at the Assistant.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: (she pockets a small
dialog: item)
dialog: I'll take it.
text: The Assistant bows and closes the trunk. We dissolve to
dialog: the set itself -
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - DAY
text: The Assistant is leaning over the counter, listening
text: intently. Diane stands in front of the counter, receiving
text: the attentions of the Make-up Man.
text: Baden's voice is overlaid:
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: I want some comedy in this scene...
scene_heading: CAMERA PULLS BACK
text: The unit is busy preparing for a retake. The studio camera
text: (and its crew) are off camera, and we concentrate on Baden
text: briefing his artistes.
text: He is clutching a script as if afraid that opening it might
dialog: be indecent exposure.
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: Instead of taking the first trunk
dialog: you see, I want you, darling... to
dialog: ask for a blue trunk - and when he
dialog: brings it to you, to ask for a red
dialog: one - and when he brings that, to
dialog: ask for a white one...
dialog: (turns to the
dialog: Assistant)
dialog: And you, Michael... get the trunks
dialog: one by one - growing more and more
dialog: fed up - and we'll end on a gag
dialog: which I'll think of in a minute -
dialog: all right?
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: I don't feel it!
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: Don't feel it! Do it!
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: (hastily)
dialog: Positions, everyone!
text: Over Mark's shoulder - behind the camera - WE WATCH the
text: Unit taking up positions.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: Who?
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
text: The red-headed bystander - Viv.
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Never mind - I'm cutting her out
dialog: of this scene... Let's run it.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Quiet, everyone!
text: From Mark's POV WE WATCH the scene being rehearsed. Diane
text: approaches the trunk counter and the Assistant smiles at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Can I interest you in a trunk?
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Thank you...
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: I'd like to see that one...
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Certainly, madam...
text: He turns away. She pockets a small item from the counter.
text: He heaves a trunk forward.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: It's beautifully fitted -
dialog: (he opens it)
text: She takes a perfunctory glance -
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: I'd like to see one in red.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Certainly, madam.
text: She pockets another item. He turns and wrestles with
text: another trunk... brings it forward and opens it
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: ... do you have one in white?
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Certainly, madam.
text: Mark walks away quietly from the back of the Camera Crew.
text: He hurries to the shelf where he keeps his cine-camera and
text: a lunch basket. He reaches for his camera.
text: Diane's voice is overlaid.
speaker_heading: DIANE (O.S.)
dialog: Do you have one in blue?
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT (O.S.)
dialog: Certainly, madam...
text: Mark turns towards the rehearsal and raises his cine-camera.
text: WE SEE the Assistant try to lift a blue trunk - and half
text: collapse with the weight of it.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Baden - beaming.
text: The Assistant manages to drag the trunk forward. He leans
text: over it - exhausted - then starts to open it.
text: Mark moves round until Diane's face is in the finder.
text: As the lid of the trunk is opened we can see only her eyes
text: above the rim of the lid... WE HEAR her scream.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Baden - freezing.
text: There is the sound of a body falling to the ground.
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: The silly bitch! She's fainted in
dialog: the wrong scene...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
text: In the darkness WE HEAR a telephone ringing... and then
text: another... and then another... then they all merge into
text: one big blast.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: CAMERA TRACKS quickly towards a door marked PUBLICITY
scene_heading: DEPARTMENT.
scene_heading: INT. PUBLICITY DEPARTMENT - DAY
text: The Head of publicity has a receiver to his ear.
scene_heading: HEAD OF PUBLICITY
dialog: is this a gag?... A girl in a
dialog: trunk!... Who is she?... Well,
dialog: which unit?... The walls are closing
dialog: in?... What a break for them!... I
dialog: mean what a heartbreak!
dialog: (he is already
dialog: speaking into
dialog: another telephone)
dialog: call a press conference.
dialog: (he turns to the
dialog: original telephone)
dialog: I'm on my way down!
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON - DAY
text: A police car. There are two men seated at the back.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - DAY
text: CHIEF INSPECTOR GREGG is reading a file. A plain-clothes
text: SERGEANT (MILLER) is seated next to him. The Sergeant
text: glances at his Chief apprehensively.
scene_heading: SERGEANT MILLER
dialog: Excuse me, Chief.
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: Mm?
scene_heading: SERGEANT MILLER
text: We pass my house when we reach the
dialog: bypass. Would you mind if I drop
dialog: off for a minute?
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: (without raising
dialog: his eyes)
dialog: To collect your kid's autograph
dialog: book?
scene_heading: SERGEANT MILLER
dialog: Yes, Chief!... If the nipper hears
dialog: where I've been...
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: (turns to the driver)
dialog: All right, Dawson - anything to
dialog: help the Sergeant...
text: (stares down at the
dialog: folder)
dialog: ... and it's about time the Sergeant
dialog: helped me - we're getting nowhere
dialog: with this.
text: Over his shoulder WE SEE what he is looking at - it is a
text: photograph of Dora in her furs and finery.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: What about that man the landlady
dialog: passed?
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: She couldn't describe him - except
dialog: to say that he was carrying
text: something that she couldn't see.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: That's a help.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector staring at the folder.
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: Sergeant, I've been on the force
dialog: thirty odd years... and I have
dialog: never seen such fear on anyone's
dialog: face as on this girl's...
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: What was it she saw?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Surely, Chief... a man coming at
text: her - with a sharp weapon.
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: I'm familiar with that kind of
dialog: terror. This is something new to
dialog: me... but what?
text: The Sergeant glances at Dora's photograph.
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: ...now take a look at how we found
dialog: her.
text: He starts to turn the page
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: A door with a sign on it: CANTEEN CLOSED TODAY.
text: CAMERA TRACKS TOWARDS it.
scene_heading: INT. CANTEEN - DAY
text: Mark is sitting by an open window at the far end of the
text: canteen. His cine-camera and lunch basket are by his side.
text: From Mark's POV WE SEE that the unit (with the exception
text: of Diane and Baden) is crowded into the canteen.
text: They have formed themselves into small groups and are
text: talking in whispers. The Assistant Director is standing
text: with his back to the door. A GIRL calls out:
speaker_heading: GIRL (O.S.)
dialog: How much longer must we wait in
dialog: here?
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
text: Till the police arrive... D.J.'s
dialog: orders.
text: Mark glances at a group in the comer. The Trunk Assistant
text: is encircled by eager listeners.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: and when she opened that trunk...
dialog: and I saw what was inside... my
dialog: dears - I nearly fainted with her -
dialog: (he runs a delicate
dialog: hand across a
dialog: delicate forehead)
dialog: and do you know what horrified me
dialog: most?
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
text: D.J. says not to discuss it.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Any more sauce from D.J. and I
dialog: shall refuse to sign for seven
dialog: years! My dears... that poor girl's
dialog: expression.
text: Mark glances out of the window.
text: From his POV WE SEE a police car driving across the
text: courtyard. Mark watches with great interest - then reaches
dialog: for his cine-camera.
text: He photographs the police, then puts his cine-camera on to
text: the table and sits back... waiting. CAMERA LINGERS for a
text: moment on the folded tripod.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SET - DAY
text: The set is completely deserted. It is lit by a single lamp.
text: A solitary trunk stands on the counter, its lid closed.
text: WE SEE Don Jarvis enter, followed by the two Policemen.
text: Baden and the Publicity man bring up the rear.
text: Don Jarvis points towards the trunks department. The Chief
text: Inspector nods, then he and the Sergeant approach the
dialog: counter.
text: Carefully the Inspector raises the lid of the trunk - he
text: looks inside.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector - over the top of the lid. His
text: expression is mainly one of surprise.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the Sergeant staring into the trunk. He is
text: also surprised - but there is nausea in his face.
text: They look up at almost the same moment... their eyes meet.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: Chief, it's exactly the...
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: I know...
text: (he closes the trunk
dialog: quickly. Quietly)
dialog: ... don't say anything.
dialog: (he faces Don Jarvis)
dialog: Well, sir... we shall probably
dialog: have to interview everyone at the
dialog: studio, so we'd better plan a
dialog: campaign that won't interfere too
dialog: much with your productions.
speaker_heading: JARVIS
dialog: (warming to him at
dialog: once)
dialog: Thank you, Chief Inspector... if
dialog: you knew what even a single day's
dialog: delay could cost.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Oh, we do sir.
text: (his eyes are on
dialog: the trunk)
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
scene_heading: INT. CANTEEN - DAY
text: He is looking out of the window - his camera at the ready.
text: Overlaid is the sound of a door opening... the buzz of
text: conversation dies away. We hear Don Jarvis' voice.
speaker_heading: JARVIS (O.S.)
dialog: If I may have your attention,
dialog: please.
text: A hand tugs at Mark's elbow. He turns round. The Clapper
text: Boy looks at him waringly.
text: From Mark's POV WE SEE Don Jarvis standing in the doorway -
text: facing a suddenly hushed room. The great man's hands are
text: folded in front of him -
speaker_heading: JARVIS
dialog: The police wish to interview each
dialog: of you individually... after which
dialog: you will be at liberty to leave.
text: From D.J.'s POV WE SEE the upturned faces - the light from
text: the window falls upon Mark, listening to him with rapt
text: attention. Mark's hands are folded in front of him.
speaker_heading: JARVIS
dialog: There will, of course, be no
dialog: shooting today... but work will be
dialog: resumed, as usual, tomorrow...
dialog: with, I hope, all of you present.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis.
speaker_heading: JARVIS
dialog: I look to you to give the police

text: Sergeant Miller enters with a smile.
scene_heading: SERGEANT MILLER
dialog: Well now... let's get ourselves
dialog: organized...
dialog: (taking a piece of
dialog: paper from his
dialog: pocket)
dialog: We don't want to keep you cooped
dialog: up in here, so we've worked out a
dialog: timetable... We'll talk to the
dialog: artists first, then the technicians
dialog: in this order...
text: Mark reaches for his cine-camera...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: A SERIES OF BRIEF SHOTS of the unit being interviewed by
dialog: the police.
scene_heading: EXT. STUDIO GROUNDS - DAY
text: The Young Extra who spoke to Vivian in the exterior set

scene_heading: CAMERA PANS.

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: EXTRA
dialog: ...she said she didn't want a lift -
dialog: because she had a call to make
dialog: locally.
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: Did she say where?
speaker_heading: EXTRA
dialog: No, sir... and when I left, she
text: was still in the dressing room.
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: I see... let's have a look at this
dialog: dressing room, shall we?
speaker_heading: EXTRA
dialog: Yes, sir ...
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGE IN STUDIO - DAY
text: The Policemen and the Extra are walking away from camera
text: down a passage. A few members of other units pass them by
text: without a glance. One of these (A GIRL) smiles into camera.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Hallo, Mark...
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Hallo.
text: The girl walks out of picture. THE CAMERA (and Mark) TRACK
text: after the Policemen.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE TO DRESSING ROOM - DAY
text: As the Inspector opens the door of the dressing room, Mark
text: hurries past. He raises his cine-camera and photographs
text: the Sergeant. The Sergeant turns to close the door. He
text: sees Mark. straightens his tie and looks as severe as he
dialog: can.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Hey, I don't think you ought to do
dialog: that!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Sorry, sir.
text: He hurries down the passage.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: (turning round)
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Make me famous. Some chap was giving
dialog: me a screen test
text: The Extra's voice is overlaid - a hint of hysteria in it.
speaker_heading: EXTRA (O.S.)
dialog: That's where she sat. Inspector.
text: The Inspector turns away, and the Sergeant closes the door.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: And whoever did it must be...
speaker_heading: CHIEF CAMERAMAN
dialog: You're next.
text: The Crew-member hurries into the office, and closes the
text: door. The Chief Cameraman wanders off thoughtfully.
text: Mark and the Clapper Boy are left sitting side by side.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: I've been watching you...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: Have you been filming those
dialog: policemen?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, I've a few quite interesting
dialog: shots of them - it's a chance I
dialog: never expected!
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: A chance for what?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: To photograph... an investigation...
dialog: or as much of it as I can.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: What on earth for?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It will complete a documentary I'm
dialog: making.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: documentary?
text: Mark nods.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: What's it about?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'd rather not tell you till it's
dialog: finished. And it soon will be ...
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: But suppose they catch you?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh they will - they look very
dialog: efficient.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: Don't you mind?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: But they might confiscate your
dialog: camera.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm afraid they will! But by then...
dialog: I'll have finished with it.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: I don't...
text: The door of the small room opens, and the Crew-member comes
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: CREW-MEMBER
dialog: You, Mark?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Thanks...
text: He rises slowly... the cine-camera is over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: Mark, hadn't you better leave that
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, John.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: I'd look after it.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm sure of that - but I'd like to
dialog: photograph them while they're
dialog: questioning me.
text: The Clapper Boy looks at him in amazement.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't suppose they'll let me.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: Mark, are you potty?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, do you think they'll notice?
text: The Clapper Boy laughs.
speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY
dialog: Don't get into any trouble for
dialog: heaven's sake  I want to discuss
dialog: that film at the Everyman...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes... I'd like that...
text: He walks slowly towards the door.

scene_heading: INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY
text: The Inspector is seated at a desk, reading some notes. The

text: at a list.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Mark Lewis - focus-puller...
dialog: Whatever that may be?
text: The Inspector nods.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Come in.
text: He puts a tick on the list. There is the sound of a door
text: opening. The Inspector looks up...
text: From his POV WE SEE a young man with a camera over his
text: shoulder advancing shyly towards him.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Mr. Lewis?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, sir...
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: I'm Chief Inspector Gregg and this

text: The Sergeant glances up.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Ah! My photographer.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I've brought the camera in case
dialog: you want to take the film away.
text: He holds out his camera. The Sergeant glances enquiringly
dialog: at the Inspector.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: That's all right, Mr. Lewis - as
dialog: long as we don't appear at the
dialog: Odeon next week in place of the
dialog: cartoon.
text: Mark smiles.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Well now; have you anything to

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Don't think so, sir.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Did you know the girl?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, sir...
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: How well?
speaker_heading: MARK
text: Mainly by sight.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: When did you see her last?
text: He picks up a pencil  taps it idly on the desk.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yesterday afternoon - when we
dialog: broke...
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Speak to her?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Called out good night - don't know
dialog: if she heard?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark's fingers... tapping on his knee in
text: time to the pencil.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: What did you do then?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Took sqme shots, sir - for a film
dialog: I'm making.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Oh... where?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: All over the place, sir... it's a

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Anyone with you?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No, sir. Just my camera.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR

dialog: Lewis?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: About ten... ten-thirty...
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Anyone see you?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes... the people downstairs.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: I see.
text: The telephone rings. The Sergeant promptly answers it.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT

speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: The doctor's finished his examin...
text: The Inspector rises at once.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: ...wants to see you -
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Right.

dialog: That'll be all for the moment, Mr.
dialog: Lewis - thank you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (he turns to the
dialog: door)
dialog: Thank you, sir ...
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: Mark stands very still.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: direct me to that set of yours,
dialog: will you? I'd probably end on
dialog: location.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'll take you there, sir.
dialog: (he opens the door)
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Thanks.
text: (he glances at the
dialog: Sergeant)
dialog: Carry on with the interviews,
dialog: Sergeant.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: From the Sergeant's POV WE SEE Mark turn to go into the
dialog: passage.

scene_heading: INT. PASSAGE - DAY
text: The Inspector and Mark walk side by side along the passage.
text: The Clapper Boy comes into view - still reading Sight and

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: ...thanks for the escort

text: The Constable closes the door - and stands in front of it.
text: Mark turns away quickly.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
text: The carpark is jammed with cars - but there is hardly anyone
text: in sight. Mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of
text: Stage E - they are a few feet apart. He looks round
text: carefully, then slips inside.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE E. - DAY
text: Facing Mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom. Beyond
text: this is another set - also in darkness - and beyond this
text: yet another. Only in the far comer of the studio - in the
text: furthermost set - is there a light burning. Voices can
text: faintly be heard coming from this set.
text: Mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to
text: the gantry. Carefully - rung by rung - he starts to climb
text: the ladder. At the top of the ladder is a gallery. Mark
text: moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above
dialog: the Policemen.
text: Mark raises his head cautiously - and looks down.
text: Far below WE CAN SEE the Inspector standing next to the
text: Doctor - a tall, silver haired man - who is peering into
text: an open trunk. Detectives are photographing the set. Mark
text: raises his cine-camera... its gentle purring seems to echo
dialog: round the studio.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark's jacket pocket. A row of pencils is
text: sticking out. As he leans forward the pencils tilt.
text: Through the finder-matte of Mark's camera WE SEE the
text: Inspector - very far away - peering into the trunk and
text: nodding.
text: A faint echo of conversation is overlaid.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (O.S.)
dialog: No doubt at all... wounds were
dialog: caused by the same instrument...
text: Mark changes lens (and alters the finder to a 75mm lens).
text: The Doctor's face - thin and impersonal - appears in the
text: finder over the lid of the trunk.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (O.S.)
dialog: ... both women... subjected to the
dialog: most violent shock...
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR (O.S.)
dialog: What sort of shock?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: ...still cannot determine - but
dialog: look!
text: He points to something in the trunk - out of the camera's
text: eye-line.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
text: He balances carefully - then raises the camera above his
text: head. As he leans forward, the pencils fall. WE SEE them
text: shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below.
text: They make three separate landings.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector. Looking up.
text: From his POV WE SEE tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow...
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Quiet, everyone. Please...
text: The Detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the
text: normal occupants of the studio - and then there is complete
dialog: silence.
text: Complete, except for the Doctor's asthmatic breathing...
dialog: And then - so gently that it might almost be in our own
text: minds - WE HEAR a purring sound from the shadows above.
text: The Inspector listens intently.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: I thought I heard a putty cat!
text: There is a burst of laughter - the Inspector frowns.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: I don't want to spoil anyone's
dialog: fun, but we do have a maniac on
dialog: our hands, and if we don't get him
dialog: quickly there'll be a third unsolved
dialog: murder to report to the
dialog: Commissioner. So let's hurry things
dialog: up, shall we?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Sorry, Chief!
text: The 'putty cat' Detective raises his flashlamp towards the
text: trunk counter. In the brilliant flash of light that ensues,
text: we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high
dialog: in the scaffolding... But then we are looking for it - no
text: one else is. The flashlight dies away.
text: The scene fades with it.
text: CLOSE SHOT of a knitting-needle held upwards.
text: Another knitting-needle scales down it like a fireman
text: descending a ladder.
scene_heading: CAMERA PULLS BACK

scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: That's very chivalrous of him.
dialog: Where's he taking you?
speaker_heading: HELEN

dialog: he has...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Which studio does he work at?
speaker_heading: HELEN

text: From his POV WE SEE the door of Helen's sitting room open -
text: and she stands on the threshold.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Hallo...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Free?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Good! So am I...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'd like you to come in for a moment -
dialog: and meet my mother.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, please...
text: She holds open the door. He goes inside. The screen
text: suddenly greys out into the veiled images of Mrs. Stephens'
text: world. We hear Helen's voice.
speaker_heading: HELEN (O.S.)
dialog: Darling, this is Mark... Mark, my
dialog: mother.
text: WE HEAR the sound of footsteps shuffling shyly forward -
text: and then Mark's voice, every intake of breath magnified.
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: How do you do... Mrs. Stephens...
text: WE HEAR the pounding of someone's heart - and then Mrs.
text: Stephens' voice.
speaker_heading: MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)
dialog: Hallo, Mark.
text: As her voice dies away.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hand clasping Mrs. Stephens'.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark looking at her, fascinated.
text: From Mark's POV WE SEE the sightless eyes turned towards
text: his. Mrs. Stephens' other hand gently feels the surface of
dialog: his.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Have you been running, young man?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes...
dialog: (he hesitates)
dialog: ... didn't want to be late for
dialog: Helen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thank you, Mark - You deserve a
dialog: drink for that! What would you
dialog: like?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Nothing - thank you... very much...
text: Mrs. Stephens grunts, and reaches for her glass.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Darling, I've left your supper in
dialog: the...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Tell me young man... Which studio
dialog: do you work at?
text: The screen greys out. WE HEAR Mark's tiny intake of breath.
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Chipperfield Studio . . .
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: And that poor girl... where did
dialog: she work?
text: Someone's heart is pounding fast.
speaker_heading: HELEN (O.S.)
text: At Brookwood.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: We were wondering if you knew her?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No - No, I didn't...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: A pity. I do like first-hand
dialog: information.
text: We hear Mark's small attempt at a laugh.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Oh, well - I mustn't keep you
dialog: gossiping after you've run all the
dialog: way from - Where?
text: Again that little intake of breath.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The station.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: Mrs. Stephens and Mark are staring at each other as if she
text: has sight and he hasn't. From Helen's POV WE CAN SEE only
text: Mark's back and her mother's upturned face.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Darling, may I tell you about your
dialog: supper?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: No... go and be told about yours!
dialog: (she takes Mark's
dialog: hand)
dialog: Goodbye, Mark... I expect we shall
dialog: meet again.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I hope so - Goodbye...
dialog: (He turns to the
dialog: door)
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen kissing her mother and whispering into
text: her ear.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Darling, we forgot to toss.
text: Mrs. Stephens grunts.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: Supper's laid out in the kitchen.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: If you're not back early, you'll
dialog: find me laid out with it!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: We'll be early! Good night, darling.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Good night...
text: Mark holds the door open for Helen and she goes into the
text: passage. Mark turns and takes a long look at Mrs. Stephens.
text: She is in the middle of raising her glass. She stops
text: suddenly, the glass poised mid-air. He goes out - closing
text: the door. She finishes her drink as if it is her last.
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGE - DAY
text: Helen is waiting by the door.
text: From her POV WE SEE Mark coming eagerly towards her, his
text: camera over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, Helen?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I want to ask you something rather
dialog: personal...
text: He looks at her anxiously.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: How long is it since you've gone
dialog: out without that?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Without what?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Your camera...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I... don't think I know?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Exactly. I've never seen you without
dialog: it... but are you going to need it
dialog: tonight?
text: He looks at her in silence.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well are you? And if so... shall I
dialog: bring some work with me too?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm not going to need it tonight!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Good - then give it to me!
text: She holds out her hand. He looks at her, appalled.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ...It'll be quite safe - I'll put
dialog: it away for you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Then take it upstairs - if you
dialog: can't trust me with it...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I trust you.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Then look...
text: She opens the door of her bedroom - and turns on the light.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ...let's put it in here.
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM
text: She crosses to a cupboard and unlocks it, then turns round.
text: He is standing hesitantly on the threshold.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Come in - and see for yourself.
text: He looks slowly round the room, stares for a moment at the
text: bed in the comer, but he won't cross the threshold. He
dialog: stays outside.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: We'll put it in here - and lock
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: This... was my mother's room.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Was it, Mark?...
text: Again he stares at the bed.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I am being tactless, aren't I?
dialog: ... It's just that... I thought it
text: was growing into an extra limb,
dialog: and - but you bring it with you if
dialog: you want to.
text: He takes off his camera - and holds it out to her.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thank you...
text: She takes it from him, puts it into the cupboard, and locks
text: it. Then offers him the key.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thank you.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I feel...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Can't describe it! Could only
dialog: photograph it -
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Shall I tell you what I feel?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Famished!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Good!
text: They hurry towards the door.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - DAY
text: They walk down the steps of the house.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: There's a small place round the
dialog: corner... It's awfully good on
dialog: Christmas Day.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes... there aren't too many open
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No - it sounds fun.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: This way.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark and Helen walking along by the side of
dialog: the house.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I adore new restaurants...
text: Suddenly Mark stands motionless. He is staring at something
text: off camera.
dialog: Especially when -
text: Her voice trails away... she is staring at Mark staring at
dialog: something.
text: In the shadows, at the mouth of an alley, a young couple
text: are kissing.
text: Mark stands motionless, staring at them. Automatically his
text: hand reaches for his camera. Helen starts to speak - then
text: looks at him in silence. The man glances round. Mark hurries
text: away and Helen stares after him.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
text: He turns back - waiting for Helen.
text: From his POV WE SEE Helen come slowly towards him. She
text: looks at him searchingly for a long moment.
text: He manages - but only just - to meet her eyes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Where is this restaurant?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Round the corner...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Know much about films?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Come on then...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Thank you.
text: They walk slowly down the street.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Sorry, young man, Helen's out.
scene_heading: CAMERA PULLS BACK
scene_heading: INT. SITTING ROOM - EVENING
text: Tony is standing unhappily opposite Mrs. Stephens.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Oh!
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
text: With Mark - from upstairs.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Oh!
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: You can stay and talk to me - if
dialog: you like?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Well I...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Know much about films?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Well...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Or film studios?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No, I...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Where's Chipperfield Studios?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Chipperfield, I suppose...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
text: There's a phone book outside...
dialog: Look up the number, will you? And
dialog: see if you can get it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Certainly... and then I must go to
dialog: my room.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Granted.
text: She lifts her glass, and sits, waiting as he crosses the
dialog: room.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: A small and very pleasant restaurant, almost full. Helen
text: and Mark have a corner table. They are dining by
text: candlelight, and there is a bottle of wine in the middle
text: of the table.
text: As CAMERA TRACKS TOWARDS them, Helen is laughing.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I like this place! And this dinner!
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
dialog: He has again won the Academy Award.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ...thank you, Mark...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Are you ready to talk about your
dialog: book?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm ready to talk about you...
text: His face falls.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It won't take a second - and it's
dialog: best to have it said.
text: Mark looks.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: Carrying a camera is only one of
dialog: your habits, isn't it, Mark?
text: He looks at her in silence.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... when you stared at that couple,
dialog: you were like the little boy on
dialog: that film you showed me... looking
text: over the wall at something he
dialog: shouldn't see. But Mark - you're
dialog: strong enough now to lift that
dialog: child off the wall... aren't you?
text: He hesitates.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... aren't you?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'll try to be.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Will you, Mark?... Will you really?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Lecture finished...
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: When your book's published - will
dialog: you go on working in a library?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes, Mark... in case, one day, a
dialog: child comes in and asks for it!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'll come in.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm not popular with my customers!
dialog: They ask me for horror comics -
dialog: and I take their sticky hands and
dialog: drag them to where there are books!
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... and do you know, Mark, waiting
dialog: for them to come in next time and
dialog: ask for books... is as exciting...
dialog: as a horror comic...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What does your magic camera
dialog: photograph?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: People...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes?...
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: It's owned by a little boy who is
dialog: terrified of grown-ups... but when
text: he looks in his magic camera he
dialog: sees grown-ups as they were when
dialog: they were children... and he isn't
text: frightened any longer.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark listening, engrossed.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... and one day he gives his camera
text: away to a little boy who is even
dialog: more frightened of grown-ups than
dialog: he was - and do you know what he
dialog: finds?
text: The little boy opposite her shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... that when he looks at grown-
text: ups without his camera he can still
dialog: see them as they were when they
dialog: were children! And that means
dialog: that he's grown up himself...
text: A moment's pause. She drinks her wine - shy, awaiting his
dialog: reaction.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What made you think of this story?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You did!
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... I looked out of my window -
dialog: and saw you going off to work
dialog: carrying that camera like a little
text: boy with a satchel... and an idea
dialog: came... so thank you...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'd like to think... I was
dialog: responsible... in some way...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Now what do I do about the
dialog: photographs?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Take 'em!
text: He slams the table so violently that a lady nearby looks
text: around... then reaches for his camera.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Oh!
text: Helen smiles.
speaker_heading: MARK
text: There isn't a single face that
dialog: doesn't look like a child's - not
dialog: a single one - if you catch it at
dialog: the right moment.
text: He turns around excitedly and sees her watching him.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It would be a challenge!... Unlike
dialog: anything I've photographed!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What have you photographed, Mark?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Everything. But nothing I'd want
dialog: children to see.
text: She looks at him curiously.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: But this would belong to them -
dialog: and they'd know if it wasn't
dialog: right... Oh, Helen... I would like
dialog: to find those faces for you...
dialog: with you...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Very well! Let's try!
text: He laughs excitedly... She looks regretfully at her watch.
text: At once he looks at his.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You made a promise to your mother -
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Yes, Mark...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You'd better keep it.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thank you...
text: He signals to the head waiter... and pays his first bill
dialog: for two.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT.STREET - NIGHT
text: They walk along the street very close together, but not
text: quite touching. Above them a light is shining on a blind
text: revealing a shadow of a woman undressing.
text: Mark glances at the blind - then looks away quickly.
text: He stares ahead of him... and continues to stare ahead of
dialog: him.
text: Suddenly Helen tucks her arm through his, and smiles up at
text: him... they walk on in silence.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALL OF MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Helen and Mark come in quietly, and close the door.
text: She glances round the dimly lit hall. There is no light
text: under any of the doors, except one at the end of the
dialog: passage.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: Mother must have gone to bed.
text: (she turns to find
dialog: him looking at her)
dialog: Mark, it was a wonderful evening...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: That's what I was going to say...
dialog: a wonderful evening...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: And you made it wonderful... without
dialog: your camera.
text: A shadow passes over his face.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: I'll get it for you.
text: He stands motionless as she goes into her room...
text: From his POV WE SEE the half-opened door - and the bed in
dialog: the comer.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark forcing himself to look away.
text: Helen reappears on the threshold - the camera in her hand.
text: He looks down at it - then slowly stretches out his hand.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: wonder how this sees grown-ups?
text: (she turns the camera
dialog: round)
dialog: ...me, for instance... now that I
dialog: am one.
text: (she looks at herself in the lens)
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Not you!
dialog: (he takes the camera
dialog: from her)
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It never will... see you!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Why not?
text: He hesitates.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Whatever I photograph -
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I always - lose...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I don't understand.
text: The door at the end of the passage opens and Tony emerges
text: in his dressing-gown, carrying a towel. He avoids looking
text: at them - goes into the bathroom opposite, and slams the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: He'll wake Mother!
text: There is the sound of running water.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... thank you, again, for my
dialog: evening.
dialog: (she is standing
dialog: very close to him,
text: smiling up into
dialog: his face)
dialog: Will you go to bed now - and not
dialog: stop up watching those films?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well... I've a little work to do...
dialog: then I'll go to bed... and think
dialog: of how to find faces for you...
text: He looks down at the face which he has found for himself.
text: She raises her head slowly.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ...faces which - are faces which...
text: She kisses him very gently on the mouth. The bathroom begins
text: to sound like a small waterfall.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Good night, Mark...
text: He watches her as she goes into the room, and doses the
text: door. A light goes on beneath the door.
text: He stands very still for a moment... then turns the camera
text: round and points the lens towards his lips.
text: Then he turns abruptly, and hurries up the stairs.
text: The waterfall cascades on. The screen grows dark - and
text: the dark-room grows out of it.
scene_heading: INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
text: The big drying drum is turning, feeding the dry print into
text: a box. A small motor drives it. CLOSE SHOT of the box.
text: Mark is spooling up the film as it comes off the drier.
text: Once or twice he can't help glancing at an image.
text: CLOSE UP of Vivian's face, in the image.
text: Mark stops the motor and the drum, loosens the end of the
text: film, spools up with a snap, slides the spool off and
text: hurries out with it.
text: Mark hurries to his projector, threads the film and starts
text: the projector. He flicks it on, as if it were a gramophone,
text: then looks eagerly at the 16mm screen.
text: Behind him something moves in the shadows
text: REVERSE SHOT of Mark.
text: Over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the
text: shadows WE SEE Mark. His head obscures what he is watching
text: on the screen.
scene_heading: HE TURNS ROUND SUDDENLY -
text: From Mark's POV WE SEE the processing sinks deep in shadow.
text: He starts to move towards them, then suddenly stares at
text: the shadows at the back of the room.
text: Silence - except for the whirring of the 16mm projector.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hand - switching on the light. Mark
text: turns round... he is as astonished at what he sees as he
dialog: can be.
text: CAMERA PANS in its own good time to the back of the room.
text: Mrs. Stephens is standing in the shadows... a heavy hand
text: rests on a heavy stick... the sightless eyes stare
text: unerringly towards the light switch.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Good evening, Mark...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ...how did you?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
text: The young man bathing himself
dialog: brought me to your door... I managed
dialog: the rest of the adventure alone...
text: He stands motionless, staring at her standing motionless.
text: Above her head an ancient, half-blind camera also stares
text: at her. The only movement in the room is her smile.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: This is one room I expected to
dialog: find locked.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I was never allowed a key..., can't
dialog: get used to them.
text: Mrs. Stephens' sightless eyes stare at him.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I brought her home early.
text: CLOSE SHOT of her hand - tightening on the heavy stick.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Thank you...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Is there something you...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: ... a talk.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Next door would be more...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: I'm at home here... I visit this
dialog: room every night.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Visit?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: The blind always live in the rooms
dialog: they live under...
text: Mark nods.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Every night you pace for hours
dialog: above my head! Why?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I've no one to talk to... in the
dialog: rooms I live over...
text: Mrs. Stephens nods. Her hand touches the black cloth loading
text: bag, lying on the table.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: I'm told that you stare too much...
dialog: so do I.
text: CLOSE SHOT of her hand - touching the black cloth bag.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - walking slowly towards her.
text: At once she raises the heavy stick - pointing it towards
dialog: him.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the stick. It is a shooting stick - with a
text: sharp spike on the end of it, similar to the tripod on
text: Mark's camera.
text: Mark stares at the stick, fascinated.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens - exploring the inside of the
text: black cloth bag with her free hand.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
text: Cloth... with something hard inside
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's a changing bag... we put films
dialog: in it - so that the light won't
dialog: spoil them...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: How odd - that the light can spoil
dialog: anything...
text: The screen greys out.
text: In Mrs. Stephens' own dark-room we hear the hum of Mark's
text: projector - and the pounding of Mark's heart - and, very
text: faintly, the sounds of Tony bathing himself.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Every night you switch on that
text: film machine.
text: We hear his tiny intake of breath.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: What are these films you can't
dialog: wait to look at?
text: The sound of his footsteps softly approaching. Like a
dialog: chair?
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Like a chair?
speaker_heading: MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)
dialog: What is the film you're showing
dialog: now?
text: Very faintly we hear Tony singing in his bath.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: The singing dies away, and the sound returns to normal.
text: Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE Mrs. Stephens holding her stick
text: in front of her.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Why don't you lie to me? I'd never
dialog: know...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You'd know at once -
text: Mrs. Stephens smiles - then turns her head towards the
text: 16mm screen.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Take me to your cinema.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes.
text: He takes her arm gently and guides her towards us.
text: Both of them stare at the 16mm screen... She leans forward -
text: her face only inches from the screen - the light from the
text: projector flickering on to her.
text: REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Slowly she stretches
text: out her hands and touches the screen.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: What am I seeing, Mark?
text: Her head and shoulders blot out most of the screen - but
text: between her outspread fingers WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of a girl's
text: terrified eyes.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Why don't you answer?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark and Mrs. Stephens.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (staring at the
dialog: screen)
dialog: It's no good - I was afraid it
dialog: wouldn't be.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARK
text: The lights failed too soon.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: (pause)
dialog: They always do.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'll have to try again.
text: He hurries to his cine-camera.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: I've yet to meet an artist who
dialog: could judge his own work...
text: Mark slips a new spool of film into his cine-camera.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: What do you think you've spoiled?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: An opportunity... now I must find
dialog: another.
text: He looks at her thoughtfully, then presses a light switch.
text: A spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes. He presses
text: another switch, and then another, until the whole of her
text: face is shining with light.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Why are you putting those lights
dialog: on my face?
text: He walks towards her. She starts to back away.
text: The shadow of Mark's head appears on the 16mm screen. WE
text: SEE him raise his camera - then pull down the tripod.
text: Black out into the grey darkness of Mrs. Stephens' world.
text: WE HEAR the purring of Mark's camera - more clearly than
text: we have yet heard it. (There is the faint rasp of a cog
text: which needs oiling.) The sound of footsteps approaching...
text: the purring changes direction.
speaker_heading: MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)
dialog: Mark...
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
text: It's almost over...
text: The purring is on top of her. There is a sudden thud.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: Mrs. Stephens is leaning against the wall... she has dropped
text: her heavy stick. It lies on the floor a few feet away from
text: her. Mark is kneeling in front of her - the tripod firmly
text: on the floor. The cine-camera is pointing upwards into her

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Please let me finish! It's for
dialog: Helen!
text: She edges towards her stick. He hurries forward and picks
text: it up. He looks at the spike on the end of it - then
text: carefully gives it to her by the handle. She grasps it
dialog: tightly.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: What do you mean? It's for Helen?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: She wants to see something I've
dialog: photographed!
text: He returns excitedly to his camera.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: My daughter sees enough of my face
dialog: without photographs...
text: On Mark's focusing screen WE SEE the fear on her face. Her
text: hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration.
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Please... don't be frightened.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Not frightened! Hot!
dialog: But it is fear that we are looking at.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: So put that camera away...
text: On the focusing screen we see her moisten her lips
dialog: nervously.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes!
text: He switches off the camera abruptly, and folds up the
text: tripod. He turns away without looking at her - and hurries
text: to the door.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens listening to his movements -
text: puzzled.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: In rather a hurry, aren't you?
text: He glances towards her.
text: From his POV WE SEE the fear in her eyes. He looks away at
text: once, staring into the darkened room.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's late.
text: From her POV (shooting over her shoulder with a large CLOSE
text: SHOT of her ear in the foreground) WE SEE Mark standing in
text: the doorway - and hear, very clearly, his quick, uneasy
dialog: breathing.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You must be tired...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: You're anxious to get rid of me
text: all of a sudden.
text: We hear his quick intake of breath.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: I won't be selfish... You can take
dialog: some more pictures - if you want
dialog: to...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No... thank you.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Why not, Mark?
speaker_heading: MARK
text: Run out of film.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Can't you find some - to please
dialog: Helen?
text: He glances towards her - then hurries into the next room.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: You don't trust yourself to take
dialog: any more, do you?
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The tapping of her stick is overlaid. Mark hurries to the
text: door and opens it - staring into the dimly lit passage.
text: Over his shoulder WE SEE her tapping her way towards him
text: from the dark-room.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't
dialog: it Mark? A pity it can't be
dialog: photographed.
text: Over her shoulder we follow the stick towards him.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: if I'd listened to it years ago, I
dialog: might have kept my sight.
dialog: (she approaches the
dialog: door)
dialog: I wouldn't have let a man operate
dialog: I had no faith in... so I'm
dialog: listening to it now...
dialog: (she puts her face
dialog: close to him)
dialog: It says all this filming isn't
dialog: healthy - and that you need help...
text: His face is averted... his eyes are closed.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: ... get it, Mark... get it
dialog: quickly... and until you've got
dialog: it... I don't want you and Helen
dialog: to see each...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'll never photograph her... I
dialog: promise you that.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: I'd rather you don't have the
dialog: chance.
text: He turns towards her - a small boy who suddenly understands
dialog: what contagious means...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: I mean it, Mark. And if you don't
dialog: listen to me... one of us will
dialog: move from this house - which would
dialog: be a pity, because we'd never find
dialog: a cheaper...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You'll never have to move... because
dialog: of me... I promise you.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Good boy.
dialog: (she takes his hand)
dialog: The stairs are the difficult part...
text: They go into the passage.
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGE - NIGHT
text: He guides her gently down the stairs. Over their shoulders
text: WE CAN SEE the door of Helen's room.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Far enough, Mark...
text: He stares at Helen's room - then looks quickly away.
text: Suddenly she raises her hands - and runs them gently over
dialog: his face...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: taking my picture?
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Yes ...
text: We can see his eyes through her outstretched fingers.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's been a long time... since
dialog: anyone did...
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS
dialog: Mark... what's troubling you?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
text: He turns away abruptly and hurries up the stairs.
scene_heading: MRS. STEPHENS

text: front of him. The Sergeant stands by the door.
speaker_heading: JARVIS
dialog: Have you any suspicions, Chief
dialog: Inspector?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: It could be any of them...
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: That's the trouble with film people -
dialog: they're all peculiar...
dialog: (hastily)
dialog: ... present company excepted.
text: He catches a glare from the great man.
speaker_heading: PUBLICITY MAN
dialog: Speaking of peculiar people.
text: The Inspector turns round.
speaker_heading: PUBLICITY MAN
dialog: We've a psychiatrist coming down
dialog: today. Dr Rosen -
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: I know him.
speaker_heading: PUBLICITY MAN
dialog: It's pure publicity - and I promise
dialog: he won't do any work.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: What will he do?
speaker_heading: PUBLICITY MAN
dialog: Get himself photographed... We're
dialog: telling the press he's here to
dialog: help the case - and to see if he
dialog: can spot the murderer.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: And the best of luck!
speaker_heading: JARVIS
dialog: Do you object. Chief Inspector?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: No...
text: The Publicity Man sighs with relief.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: I'll be frank. I'd welcome anyone's
dialog: help... I don't know how this maniac
dialog: kills - or why he kills - or who
dialog: he'll kill next, but if he isn't
dialog: caught quickly...
dialog: (he shrugs')
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: Inspector, have you convinced
dialog: yourself he's a member of my unit?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: No, sir ... but a few things seem
dialog: to point to it... No one outside
dialog: your unit admits to knowing the
dialog: girl... There was a trunk all ready
dialog: for her... and with the risks he
dialog: was running, I think he'd have to
dialog: use surroundings he was familiar
dialog: with... Where is your unit now?
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: Waiting for me on the set.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: I'd like to watch them at their
dialog: jobs, sir. It may tell me more
dialog: than a hundred interviews.
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: But, Inspector, the strain on them
dialog: is already...
speaker_heading: JARVIS
dialog: Come now, Arthur, if that's what
dialog: the Inspector wants.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: I'm afraid it is, sir... now where
dialog: could I get the best view?
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: (sulkily)
dialog: On the dolly... the camera... You
dialog: can watch everyone and everything
dialog: from there... including me!
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Very well, sir ... I'll become a

speaker_heading: BADEN

speaker_heading: VOICE 2

scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY

speaker_heading: DRIVER

speaker_heading: DOCTOR

text: near the sound crew.
text: Baden walks on to the set, his arm round Diane's shoulder.
text: He is talking to her softly. She keeps her eyes on the
text: floor; he leads her to the front of the studio camera.
speaker_heading: BADEN
dialog: Try it, darling... We'll all be
dialog: with you.
text: He pats her arm reassuringly. The Chief Cameraman nods to
dialog: Mark.
text: From the Inspector's POV WE SEE Mark pull a tape measure
text: from the front of the camera and hold it to Diane's
text: forehead. From Mark's POV WE SEE the Inspector watching
text: him over the top of the studio camera. A man with a shock
text: of white hair is also watching him... and the Sergeant
text: stares at him from the other side of the set. The tape
text: measure in Mark's hand remains steady.
text: From the Inspector's POV WE SEE Mark replace the tape
text: measure and take up his position on a small stool by the
text: side of the camera.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Quiet, everyone. Let's run it!

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Terribly sorry.

speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: I'd like to see... that one...

speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: ... have you it... in red...?
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT

speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: ... in... red
dialog: (suddenly she covers

dialog: hands')
dialog: I can't! I can't, Arthur!
text: She bursts into tears and runs off the set. From the
text: Inspector's POV WE SEE Baden whisper to the Assistant
text: Director - then hurry after Diane.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: Ten minutes break, everyone!
text: The unit dissolves into small, chattering groups. The
text: Assistant Director hurries up to the Doctor.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: Can you suggest anything, Doctor?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No. It looked jolly interesting to
dialog: me.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: I mean to help her
dialog: psychologically...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Yes. Give the girl a proper rest...
dialog: Ten minutes is useless!
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: (hastily)
dialog: Thank you, Doctor.
text: He bustles off and the Doctor is left alone. He glances
text: round thoughtfully.
text: From the Doctor's POV WE SEE the small, chattering groups.
text: Then we see Mark standing a few yards away, watching him.
text: The Doctor smiles at him pleasantly.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: What's your job?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm a focus-puller...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Oh... so am I, in a way.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I was wondering if you knew my
dialog: father - Professor Lewis...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Professor... but of course I knew
dialog: him. He lectured to me.
text: He looks at Mark with renewed interest. So does the
dialog: Inspector.
text: From his POV WE SEE Mark and the Doctor talking. The Doctor
text: is fidgeting with his watch chain. Mark fidgets with his
text: jacket button. The Inspector then glances towards the Hat
text: Salesman, who is holding court in the comer. We return to
text: Mark and the Doctor.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: He was an extraordinary man - quite
dialog: brilliant!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You know what he was interested in
dialog: before he died?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No? Tell me...
text: Mark puts his hands behind his back.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't remember what he called
dialog: it... It was something to do with
dialog: what causes people to be... peeping
dialog: Toms...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Scoptophilia!... That would interest
dialog: him! A most fertile mind.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Scopto...?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: philia... The morbid urge to gaze...
dialog: Coined since his day... Have you
dialog: any manuscripts of his which I
dialog: could...?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He thought... it could be cured...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Usually. Now about his manuscripts -
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Quickly?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: The cure? Very quick... A couple
dialog: of years analysis - three times a
dialog: week - an hour a time - and it's
text: soon up-rooted...
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - his last hope gone.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: ... if you've any of his papers on
dialog: the subject?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yes, Doctor...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I'd like to see them - I'll give
dialog: you my address, young man.
text: From the Sergeant's POV WE SEE the Doctor hand Mark a card,
text: and pat him jovially on the shoulder. The Sergeant edges
dialog: up to the Inspector.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Wonder what all that's about?
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: We'll find out afterwards... Now,
dialog: listen... I want you to watch who
dialog: brings their own lunches... Someone
dialog: ate homemade cakes and sandwiches
dialog: by the side of those bushes - and
dialog: we may get a lead.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT

dialog: (bringing out a
dialog: small postcard)
dialog: I ought to charge you!

speaker_heading: CLAPPER BOY (O.S.)
dialog: You don't get that in Sight and

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Darling...
text: She shakes her mother's shoulders. Mrs. Stephens snores
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Darling.
text: She shakes her again  but it is hopeless. Helen pulls the
text: bedclothes round her mother, then turns away. She picks up
text: a large envelope and her handbag, and hurries to the door.
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGE. MARK'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
text: Helen walks towards the stairs. The door of Tony's room
text: opens, and he pokes his head round.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Hallo.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Hallo, Tony...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: To leave something for Mark...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You haven't much time for me these
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Tony...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It's all right - I'll be here - if
dialog: you want me.
text: (he turns to his
dialog: room)
dialog: ... by the way... your mother was
dialog: yelling out something before you
dialog: came in... about Mark photographing
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Photographing Mother? You must be
dialog: mistaken!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Of course. See you sometime.
text: He goes into his room, closing the door. She stares after
text: him for a moment, then hurries up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGE BY MARK'S ROOM - DAY
text: Helen knocks on the door.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark...?
text: No answer. She knocks again, then opens the door and goes
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: Helen enters and glances towards the door of the dark-room.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: Mark? No answer. She looks
text: thoughtfully at the envelope in
text: her hand - then goes in to the
text: dark-room.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM
text: Helen fumbles for a switch... she finds one and presses
text: it. A spotlight falls on Mark's projector, throwing its
text: shadow on to the dazzling white screen. Helen smiles, and
text: walks towards the projector.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - DAY
text: Taxi arrives and Mark gets out.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE PHONE BOOTH - EARLY EVENING
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: ... don't know what to make of it,
dialog: sir ... He went to a library, a
dialog: solicitor's office, and a
dialog: newsagent's shop - private
dialog: photography there, if you ask me.
dialog: Shall I hang around outside the
dialog: house, sir? Don't think so,
dialog: either... All right, sir, I'll
dialog: give you the details when I get
dialog: back... Bye, sir.
dialog: (he replaces the
dialog: receiver)
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She is standing by the projector,
text: holding her envelope thoughtfully.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM
text: She smiles suddenly and opens her envelope. She takes out
text: a bound manuscript. We see a label on the manuscript: The
text: Magic Camera by Helen Stephens. She takes a pencil from
text: her pocket, and opens the manuscript. Then she sits at
text: Mark's table and writes a note on the flyleaf. The projector
text: is at her elbow.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: A telephone by a man's elbow. It rings.
scene_heading: INT. SCOTLAND YARD - EVENING
text: The Chief Inspector snatches up the telephone.
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: Chief Inspector Gregg! What? Put
text: him on the line...
scene_heading: CROSS CUT TO:
text: Mr. Peters - looking very sick - on the telephone.
speaker_heading: MR. PETERS
dialog: went up to look around - found
dialog: her.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the Chief Inspector.
speaker_heading: CHIEF INSPECTOR
dialog: Yes, yes... What's the address?
dialog: ... Newsagent's shop? ... Did you
dialog: say news...?
text: He slams down the receiver, and jumps to his feet.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - EVENING
text: An empty taxi cruising down the street. It passes the
text: Detective in the raincoat walking away from Mark's house.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: CLOSE SHOT of a note on a flyleaf which reads 'From one
dialog: Magic Camera - which needs the help of Another'.
scene_heading: INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
text: Helen closes the manuscript and lays it carefully by the
text: side of the projector. She turns to leave - then looks
text: curiously at the projector.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen - hesitating. Like a small girl in
text: front of her mother's make-up box, she touches the projector
text: tentatively, hesitates again, then presses a switch. A
text: beam of light shoots out. We watch Helen's face as she
text: looks at the screen. Nothing seems wrong for a few seconds -
text: then something starts to happen to the comers of her
text: mouth... and then her eyes become locked... and cannot
text: stop watching. Some kind of sound comes from the back of
text: her throat. Her hands dig into the table and she tries to
text: stand up. She cannot manage it the first time - and keeps
text: on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare,
text: she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towards
text: the door.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing there - watching her.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen staring at him... again we hear that
text: sound from the back of her throat. He looks away from her
text: at once.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Don't let me see you...
dialog: frightened...
text: (he pushes the door
dialog: wide open...)
dialog: Leave!
text: (he looks at her -
text: then looks quickly
dialog: away)
dialog: Hurry, Helen!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Not...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Leave!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Not...
dialog: (she turns away
dialog: from him and forces
dialog: the words out)
dialog: ... till I know...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Now!
text: She stands with her back to him. From REVERSE ANGLE we see
text: her struggling for breath. Over her shoulder WE SEE him
text: staring at the 16mm screen.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That film...
text: Over her shoulder we see him hurry towards the projector.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That film...
text: The sound of him switching it off.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... is ... just a film...
text: She wheels round towards him.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... isn't it?
text: From REVERSE ANGLE we see her looking at him.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... horrible ... horrible... but...
dialog: just a film... isn't it?
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No...
text: (he walks towards
dialog: the door)
dialog: I killed them...
text: (he locks the door
text: with a hint of
dialog: sadness)
dialog: And now that you know... I want
dialog: you with me... a while.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen  not enough breath to scream... hardly
dialog: enough to breathe.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You'll be safe - as long as I can't
dialog: see you frightened - so stand in
dialog: the shadows, Helen... please...
text: She stands motionless.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ... please...
text: From her POV WE SEE him standing in front of the door,
text: looking ahead of him. She backs slowly away into the shadows
text: at the back of the room.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: She's right... your mother... must
dialog: tell someone everything... sorry...
dialog: has to be you!
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen standing in the shadows where her mother
dialog: stood.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: This was his laboratory... and you
dialog: know some of what he did... but
dialog: not all.
text: The room is suddenly filled with the terrified screaming
text: of a small boy. Helen wheels round. The screaming seems to
text: be coming from the walls. Mark's hand is on a switch - one
text: of a number on a panel.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ... aged five...
text: He presses another switch. There is a click, and the
text: screaming stops, to be replaced by a low sobbing.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ... aged seven...
text: He presses another switch. There is a moment's silence.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: All the rooms were wired for
dialog: sound... and... still are.
text: WE SUDDENLY HEAR the ticking of a clock.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Your room.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen - listening.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Your mother's .
text: The click of a switch - and we hear a loud snoring.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Tony's.
text: The click of a switch - and we hear Tony's voice.
speaker_heading: TONY (O.S.)
dialog: No one will come in... honestly,
dialog: darling...
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I don't care!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: But darling...
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Stop it, Tony!
text: Mark listens with interest.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Turn it off!
text: He does so - at once. She walks towards him. He turns away
dialog: from her.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Look at me, Mark!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Not if you're frightened...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Look at me!
text: Slowly he faces her.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What did you do... to those girls?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What did you do, Mark...?
text: He tries to turn away - but she follows him.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: If you want to torment me... for
dialog: the rest of my life... then make
dialog: me imagine!
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - his eyes closed.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What did you do ... to those girls?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Can't...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Show me, Mark...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: But if you're frightened...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Show me - or I'll remain
dialog: frightened... for the rest of my
dialog: life. Show me!
text: He turns to his cine-camera, and picks it up. He releases
text: the tripod.
text: CAMERA HOLDS on Helen. She stands very still against the
text: wall. Mark's voice is overlaid.
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Do you know... what the most
dialog: frightening thing in the world
dialog: is?...
text: She is looking at something, puzzled.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's fear.
text: The sound of his footsteps approaching...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: So I did something... very simple...
text: WE SEE a look of fear spring into her eyes.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Very simple.
text: WE SEE the spike approaching her throat... but she is
text: looking at something else.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: When they felt the spike... touching
dialog: their throats... and knew I was
dialog: going to kill them...
text: The spike is touching her throat.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: ... I made them - watch their own
dialog: deaths!
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen's face several times its natural size.
text: She is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying
text: mirror which has been fitted over the camera's face. The
text: mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera. There
text: is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of
text: the camera winks. As Helen looks at her terrified distorted
text: face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle
text: of her forehead.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Made them see their own terror as
dialog: the spike went in... and if death
dialog: has a face, they saw that too!
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark - crouching behind the mirror, sweat
text: pouring down his forehead... his finger on the trigger of
dialog: the camera.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Not you! Not you! I'll never
dialog: photograph you! I promised - I
dialog: promised - Not you!
text: Helen's eyes are closed. The spike is still touching her
dialog: throat.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark  his face turned away from the
text: viewfinder.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: ... frightened ... for you...
text: There's the sound of a car pulling up. He hurries to the
dialog: other room.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The Police arrive: three cars. Mark appears at an upstairs
text: window with his camera.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Look out!
text: He thinks Mark has a gun. They all duck. Mark raises his
text: camera and photographs them. The Police recover and charge
text: for the house. Mark disappears.
scene_heading: INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
text: Mark hurries back into the room carrying his camera. He
dialog: knows exactly what he has to do.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Mark! Mark! Give yourself up!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I've been ready for this... for
dialog: such a long time...
text: Rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall. Then
text: he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards
dialog: him...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What are you...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It'll be all right.
text: He makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera,
text: then switches on all the floodlights. WE CAN HEAR the
text: Policemen pounding on the door.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I can beat that!
text: He crosses to a switch - presses it. The room is filled
text: with a small boy's screaming.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Give yourself up... Mark!
text: He stands next to her, and looks at his long array of
text: cameras. WE SEE that each one of them has been fitted with
text: a small metal disc (a delayed release), and that some of
text: the older cameras have flashlights attached.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Watch them, Helen... Watch them
dialog: say goodbye - one by one -
dialog: (he presses a master
dialog: switch on the wait)
dialog: I've timed this... so often...
text: Slowly he walks past his cameras. As he does, the metallic
text: disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the eye
text: of each camera winks once as if in salute. Some go off
text: with flashlights on either side of the room. The sound of
text: footsteps hurrying up the stairs.
text: Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer  are the spikes of
text: the tripod. The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the
text: approach - and Helen's terrified face.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No - No!
text: The child's screaming reaches its peak as Mark approaches
text: the spikes... Ahead of him, on the small table where his
text: projector stands, is Helen's book The Magic Camera.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I wish... I could have found your
dialog: faces for you...
text: The Policemen are now rattling on the dark-room door.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Helen - I'm afraid!
text: We see his face, terrified, in the magnifying mirror. The
text: spikes are against his throat. The eye of the camera is
text: winking rapidly.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm glad I'm afraid!
text: Heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark-room door...
text: as it breaks in, Mark lunges forward against the spikes.
text: The cine-camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls
text: back. He crashes against the small table, which falls over.
text: He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him by
text: the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face
text: like a canopy. WE SEE his face in the lens of the cine-
text: camera. and WE SEE his hand - lying limp on the cover of
dialog: The Magic Camera.
text: The Policemen hurry into the room. They stare motionless
text: at what they see.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Helen - her face buried in her hands.
text: The child's screaming stops suddenly... and in the absolute
text: silence which follows WE HEAR the voice of Mark's father:
speaker_heading: FATHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Don't be a silly boy... there's
dialog: nothing to be afraid of...
text: And a small voice answers.
speaker_heading: CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Good night, Daddy...
text: The spotlights begin to dim... The dazzling white of the
text: 16mm screen fades slowly into greyness...
text: The room is filled with the gentle breathing of a small
dialog: child.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
