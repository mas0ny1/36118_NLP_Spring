dialog: Max! MAX!!! Max! Max! Max! Max!
dialog: Max!
text: Exhausted, she pushes an upside down clay pot towards the

speaker_heading: GIDGET (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TIBERIUS (0.S.)

speaker_heading: GIDGET

speaker_heading: TIBERIUS (0.S.)

speaker_heading: GIDGET
dialog: Uh...Hello?
text: Through a SMALL WINDOW, we see the dark shape of TIBERIUS, A

speaker_heading: TIBERIUS
dialog: I can see for miles. If you let me
dialog: out, I’ll find your friend.

speaker_heading: GIDGET

speaker_heading: TIBERIUS
dialog: You're sweet, too.
dialog: (sniffs)
speaker_heading: GIDGET
dialog: Oh, thanks, stranger!
speaker_heading: TIBERIUS
dialog: But not too sweet. There’s also a
text: salty, gamey thing going on.
speaker_heading: GIDGET
dialog: Yeah, that’s me! Come on, let’s get
dialog: you out of that shed.
text: Gidget opens the door. As she walks toward Tiberius, we hear
text: a horrible CRUNCHING sound. Light hits Tiberius and we see
text: that he’s wearing a HOOD.
speaker_heading: TIBERIUS
dialog: Yeah. That’s it. Just step over
text: the pile of bones.
speaker_heading: GIDGET
dialog: Pile of bones, okay, will do! I

speaker_heading: TIBERIUS
dialog: You're a very thoughtful food.
dialog: Food? I didn’t say that, I said

speaker_heading: GIDGET
dialog: I’m sure lucky I found you, uh...
speaker_heading: TIBERIUS
dialog: ...Tiberius. And yes, this is a

speaker_heading: GIDGET
dialog: Ahhh, no! Aaah!
dialog: The Secret Life of Pets 38.

speaker_heading: GIDGET
dialog: Oh! You tried to eat me!
speaker_heading: TIBERIUS
dialog: (ashamed)

speaker_heading: GIDGET
dialog: You should be sorry! You deserve

dialog: bird!
text: Tiberius looks guilty.
speaker_heading: TIBERIUS
dialog: I can’t help it. I was born with
dialog: killer instincts.
speaker_heading: GIDGET
dialog: That is just no excuse!
speaker_heading: TIBERIUS
dialog: You're right. Even for a predator,

speaker_heading: TIBERIUS

text: After a tense beat, he takes a deep breath...
speaker_heading: TIBERIUS
dialog: So what does this "Max" look like?
speaker_heading: GIDGET
text: Brown and white. He’s a short

speaker_heading: TIBERIUS

speaker_heading: SNAKES

speaker_heading: SNOWBALL

speaker_heading: SNOWBALL (CONT'D)
dialog: Follow me.

speaker_heading: SNOWBALL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAX

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: No. Wait, oh, I--
dialog: (sighs, collapses)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: I dunno, Duke, maybe the legend of
