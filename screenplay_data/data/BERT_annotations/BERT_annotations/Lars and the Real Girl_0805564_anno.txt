scene_heading: EXT. MIDWEST WINTER LANDSCAPE -- EARLY MORNING
text: The beginning of winter. Dead cold fields; pine and bare tree
text: woods; a highway that leads to a small town, a lake.
text: Beautiful in a stark winter way but very cold.
scene_heading: EXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE
dialog: Establishing.
scene_heading: EXT. LARS'S GARAGE APT. -- MORNING
dialog: Establishing.
scene_heading: INT. LARS'S GARAGE APT. -- MORNING
text: Lars is dressed for church. He wears an old, hand-knitted
text: paby blanket like a shawl. He looks out the window, watches
text: smoke rise from the chimneys in the neighborhood. He watches
text: the family next door--husband, wife, children--in an ordinary
text: Sunday morning routine. His breath mists the glass.
text: His rooms are sterile: bed, computer, one bowl, one plate,
text: one cup; furniture he must have grown up with. We see a
text: wedding picture of his parents, a wedding picture of his
text: brother Gus and his sister-in-law Karin.
scene_heading: EXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: BACKYARD -- CONTINUOUS
text: From the main house, KARIN, early 30's, pregnant but not
text: showing yet, hurries across the backyard, past a big stack of
text: firewood, to the garage. She’s thrown a sweater over her
text: bathrobe and wears slippers. She's the kind of woman who
text: looks good in cold weather and no make-up.
scene_heading: INT. LARS’S GARAGE APT.--WINTER--CONTINUOUS
text: Lars opens the door. He’s awkward and nervous with her, and
text: concerned to see her in the cold.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Karin!
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: I'm inviting you for breakfast.
text: Lars puts his blanket around her shoulders, careful not to
text: touch her.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Sorry, I’m on my way to church.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: After church, then. Come on, we
dialog: haven’t seen you for so long.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: You're going to have a baby, run
dialog: back in the house, what if you get
dialog: sick?
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: Come on, please.
text: She reaches to touch him, he takes a little step back. It’s a
text: subtle, practiced move, he does it unconsciously with
dialog: everybody, most people don’t notice. But today she does.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Yes, yes, okay.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: Promise?
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Promise.
text: He watches her run back to the house--he wants to make sure
text: she arrives safely. The house, to Lars, seems very far away.
scene_heading: INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: Karin enters.
dialog: cus
dialog: (sleepy)
dialog: well?
text: Karin crawls back in bed with GUS, 40, a bigger, stronger,
dialog: warmer version of Lars.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: You owe me five dollars.
dialog: Gus
text: Not till he's sitting at the table.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: Something's going on with him. I'm
dialog: worried.
text: Gus doesn’t pay much attention. He nuzzles her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

dialog: 
dialog: LARS by Nancy Oliver - 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You keep saying that. Your maternal
text: instincts are kicking in.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: He never lets me touch him.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Well, we're not like your family.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: What does that mean?
dialog: cus
dialog: A million brothers and sisters
text: fighting and hugging all the time.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: That’s the way it’s supposed to be.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: He's shy, he'll grow out of it. I
dialog: sure did.
text: He pounces on her, making her laugh. They forget about Lars.
text: We hear church bells.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH - MORNING
dialog: A small Protestant church, friendly, not forbidding. We can
text: hear sincere, bad Protestant singing.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
text: It’s bright inside, white walls, stained glass, full of
text: ordinary working- and middle-class people. Behind REVEREND
text: BOCK the choir sits, among them MARGO, same age and type as
text: LARS. She looks out and notices Lars, he doesn’t see her. As
text: usual with sermons, no one’s listening.
speaker_heading: REVEREND BOCK
dialog: Now, we have books and books and
dialog: books of laws. But in all the
dialog: world, there‘s really only one law.
text: During the sermon, Lars’s POV: he looks at the cross,
text: candles, flowers, a stained glass portrait of Mary and baby
dialog: Jesus, other people‘s families, the little dramas in every
text: pew. His gaze pauses on Margo who is looking through her
text: music. Next to Lars, a restless little boy drops a stuffed
text: animal. Lars picks it up, hands it back. He and the little
text: boy look at each other.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: LARS by Nancy Oliver - 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: e@ REVEREND BOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: We need never ask, “what should I
dialog: do?” We need never pray, “Lord,
dialog: what should I do?” Because the Lord
dialog: has told us, “Love one another.”
dialog: That, my friends, is the one true
dialog: law. “Love one another” is God in
dialog: action.
text: The choir rises to sing badly again.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - LATER
text: People file out after the service. A brisk older lady, MRS.
text: GRUNER, 60's, tries to lift an unwieldy flower arrangement.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Need help, Mrs. Gruner?
scene_heading: MRS. GRUNER
dialog: Thank you, dear, it’s my turn to
text: drop them off at the hospital.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT -- LATER
text: e Lars carries the flowers as they walk to Mrs. Gruner‘s car.
text: She looks him over, approving.
scene_heading: MRS. GRUNER
dialog: You’re a handsome fella, Lars.
dialog: Where‘s your girlfriend?
dialog: This is a question that causes Lars pain.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: I don’t have one.
scene_heading: MRS. GRUNER
dialog: Are you gay? Wouldn't bother me. My
dialog: grandson’s gay, I know all about
dialog: the gays.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: No, I’m not gay.
scene_heading: MRS. GRUNER

dialog: good for you.
text: She hands him a flower from the arrangement.
speaker_heading: MRS. GRUNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Give this to somebody nice, for a
dialog: start.
text: She drives away. Margo walks up behind LARS.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Hello, Lars.
text: He turns and steps back.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Hello, Margo.
text: Neither of them can think what to say.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: See you at work tomorrow?
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Lars starts to walk away. Margo is disappointed. Then he
text: turns back and thrusts the flower at her. She lights up.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Oh! Wait--
text: But Lars power-walks away.
scene_heading: INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: KITCHEN -LATER
text: Gus cooks as he and Karin argue in a friendly way.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: He’s 30 years old. Maybe he WANTS
dialog: to be left alone.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: That‘s NOT what he wants.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: Because that’s not how people are.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Through the window, we can see Lars sneak past, gradually
dialog: increasing speed.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (spots him)
dialog: Whoops, there he goes!
text: He and Karin run to the door.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Lars!
text: Lars dashes toward his apartment.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: You promised!
text: Lars waves and disappears inside.
dialog: cus
dialog: Five bucks.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: Is that normal?
text: Gus shrugs, turns back to cooking. Karin turns back to Lars‘s
text: apartment, a determined look on her face.
scene_heading: INT. LARS’S GARAGE APT.~-WINTER--NIGHT
text: Lars rocks in the rocker, still wearing his church clothes,
text: his bed made. It’s 4 AM. He’s been awake all night.
scene_heading: EXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: DRIVEWAY -- NEXT MORNING
text: Haggard, Lars drives out. Karin watches him from the house.
scene_heading: EXT. LARS’S CAR — DAY
text: Lars drives to work through small-town landscape, winter
dialog: bleak.
scene_heading: EXT, INDUSTRIAL PARK -- LATER

speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: (lying)
dialog: Oh, yeah. Woo.
text: He's very aware of her curves, they make him anxious, yet he
text: can’t make himself move away from them. Cindy is fond of Lars
dialog: and likes to fix people up.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: The new girl’s cute. You and Margo,
dialog: what do you think?
text: Lars struggles to speak but can‘t, makes a few strange
dialog: noises.
speaker_heading: CINDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (mystified)
dialog: Lars?
text: Mute, Lars waves and walks away.
speaker_heading: CINDY (CONT’D)
dialog: Take care}!
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Discouraged, Lars enters a room with three cubicles. KURT, a
text: knee-jiggling co-worker, is already at his computer. Each
text: cubicle features personal items: KURT’s is full of action
text: figures. Margo's has plants and a teddy bear. Lars’s is spare-
text: - maybe a small picture of Gus and Karin. We hear the
text: distinctive REAL GIRL music theme.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You gotta see this!
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: I’m not in the mood for porn.
speaker_heading: KURT

speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, it is, but check it out!

dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: Huh? Huh?
text: Lars looks closer.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Inflatable?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Nope. Real. Like if she’d weigh a
dialog: hundred twenty-five pounds, she
dialog: weighs a hundred twenty-five
dialog: pounds.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Look, you can customize everything.
dialog: They have all these different heads
dialog: and parts. You can design your own
dialog: woman}
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Mine has the “Monique” head and the
text: “Jennifer” boobs and the “Tracy”
text: waist and the “Veronica” butt and
text: the “Roxanne” legs.
dialog: (man to man)
dialog: Lars, she‘s anatomically correct.
dialog: You can do anything with her.
speaker_heading: LARS

dialog: Don't tell me you’re gonna get one.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Nah, they cost six thousand bucks.
text: I‘m wiped out from the new X-box.
text: Enter Margo. She and Kurt have a playful, adversarial
dialog: relationship.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Morning.
text: They don’t notice her. She tries again, louder.
speaker_heading: MARGO (CONT'D)
dialog: Morning!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Whoa!
text: He zaps up a screensaver. Lars is embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (to Lars)
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 
text: Lars ducks his head, acknowledging her, scoots back into his
text: cubicle. Kurt turns on his headbanger work music. Lars jumps,
text: nerves raw. He has to tell Kurt this every day.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Headset!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Lars, it’s your day to get us
dialog: coffee.
text: He puts on his headset, but also watches Lars and Margo.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I was thinking, we’re the only ones
dialog: from the lake, maybe we could
dialog: carpool.
text: Lars scoots out. Margo looks after him, not understanding.

speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Oh, shut up.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE HALLWAY -~- CONTINUOUS
text: Lars is extremely frustrated by his inability to respond to
text: Margo. He mutters to himself, runs his hands through his
text: hair, leaving it spiky and disheveled.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE: COFFEE ROOM ~-- CONTINUOUS
text: STEVE, a co-worker on his way out with a plate of frosted Pop
text: Tarts, looks at Lars.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You okay, buddy?
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Sure.
text: As soon as Steve leaves, Lars opens the refrigerator freezer
text: and sticks his head in to revive himself. But when he takes
text: his head out, he feels the same.
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE - DUSK
text: Lars steps out of the building and watches the winter sunset.
text: It's cold. He's not wearing hat or gloves. A razor wind
dialog: blows.
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE PARKING LOT -- LATER
text: Margo’s car is next to Lars's car. She pretends to fumble
text: with her keys, watching him approach. He’s troubled, remote.
text: LARS POV: He sees Margo, small and far away although she
text: really isn’t. He stops at a distance from her.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: LARS

scene_heading: INT. MALL -- LATER
text: Lars wanders aimlessly. SANDY, 30‘s, stylish, waves at him
text: from her dress shop, he waves back, joyless. Lars sits at the
text: mall fountain. He sees nothing but families and couples. At
text: the food court, same thing. He buys mall food but can‘t eat.
text: He feels his isolation like a physical illness.
scene_heading: EXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: DRIVEWAY -- LATER
text: As Lars drives in from work, Karin stands in the middle of
text: the driveway with a flashlight, flagging him down like the
text: airport person on a runway. He slams on the brakes and jumps
text: out of his car, fearing disaster.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Are you okay? What happened? What's
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: We want you to come for dinner.
text: Lars is immediately wary. Karin bounces a little on her toes,
text: preparing to move.
speaker_heading: LARS.
dialog: (lying) I can’t. I brought work
dialog: home.
text: He tries to dodge her, she blocks him.
speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: No, you didn’t.
speaker_heading: LARS

speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Okay, okay.
scene_heading: INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: DINING ROOM -- LATER
text: The end of the meal. Lars is distant and quiet, he’s hardly

speaker_heading: KARIN
dialog: (to Lars, gentle)
dialog: Tf that’s all you can eat...
speaker_heading: LARS

dialog: that.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: Well, I’m not Dad!
text: Gus is startled by his vehemence.
speaker_heading: LARS (CONT'D)
dialog: He was more like a refrigerator
dialog: than a man.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No, he wasn’t.
text: Lars looks at him, he concedes.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Only after Mom died. I wish you
dialog: could have known him before.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: I wish I could have known HER.
text: Gus is sympathetic but more occupied with his own discomfort
text: than Lars’s feelings, of which he is barely aware. He makes
text: an offer, just short of sincere.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You know, we'd really like it if
dialog: you move in.
text: Lars shakes his head no. He knows Gus doesn't really mean it.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY
text: A funeral on a beautiful, sunny spring day. Around the grave,

dialog: Almost everyone we've seen is present except children. Lars

text: restless, unsure of how to behave at such a curious occasion.
speaker_heading: REVEREND BOCK
dialog: Lars asked us not to wear black

text: @ The mourners settle, interested.
speaker_heading: REVEREND BOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Without even trying, Bianca brought

dialog: courage and constancy. Did you ever
dialog: once see her yield to disability or
dialog: despair?
dialog: People shake their heads, no, they never did. Everyone is
dialog: moved in their own way.

text: Everyone becomes aware of him. They watch him, compassionate.
speaker_heading: REVEREND BOCK (CONT’D)
dialog: ESPECIALLY him. But Lars, don’t

text: Lars nods. He won't forget.
speaker_heading: REV. BOCK
dialog: So let us not grieve for her. Let

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY -- LATER
text: The cemetery is empty except for Lars, Margo and Dagmar, who

speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: We used to come here sometimes. She

speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I like it, too. Peaceful.

speaker_heading: LARS

speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Me, neither.
speaker_heading: LARS
dialog: We'll feel better as time goes on.
