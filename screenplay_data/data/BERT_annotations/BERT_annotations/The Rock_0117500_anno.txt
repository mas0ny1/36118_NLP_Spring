speaker_heading: CAPTAIN FRYE
dialog: Would the General like a recitation of our service records?
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: I'm well aware of your service records, Captain, they are
dialog: excellent. I want to be clear on why you - why all of us are here. You
dialog: both stand to profit from this.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN FRYE
dialog: Profit is not my motive, sir. I am here to redress a
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN DARROW
dialog: Yes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson.
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: This country has places where wrongs are redressed, Captain
dialog: Darrow: They are called courts of law. In the military, they are called
dialog: Courts Martial. This country has places where lessons a-re leaned. They
dialog: are called schools. Am I confusing you?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN DARROW
dialog: Well, sir, frankly ...

speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: The only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason.
dialog: Plain and simple. An insurrection against a government to which we have
dialog: sworn allegiance. Everyone in this room must understand that.
text: Hummel looks from face to face, studying each.
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: The question is what kind of traitor are we. Coward or lion?
dialog: Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson? I have posed that question to
dialog: myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear. Have all of you?
speaker_heading: HUMMELS' OFFICERS
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: HUMMEL

speaker_heading: OTHER OFFICERS

speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: Well, I cannot. So, regardless of what happens on this island in

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN HENDRIX
dialog: But General, you'll be prosecuted.
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: Yes, Captain. And I plan on conducting my own defense. it will

scene_heading: LOUIS LINDSTROM, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs GENERAL ALBERT KRAMER, Air

speaker_heading: GENERAL KRAMER
text: Last night Hummel and eleven marines, under the guise of

dialog: discovered until the shift change this morning.
text: ON THE SCREEN - A YOUNGER HUMMEL in Vietnam.
speaker_heading: GENERAL KRAMER
dialog: Here he is in Vietnam - I think a Major at the time.
text: MORE SLIDES OF HUMMEL in various international theaters.
speaker_heading: HAYDEN SINCLAIR

dialog: Three purple hearts... two silver stars and... the Congressional Medal

dialog: (looks up)
text: The man is a hero.
speaker_heading: GENERAL KRAMER
dialog: A legend. During Tet he held off a brigade of V.C.
dialog: single-handedly. Saved his whole company. Hence the nickname
dialog: "gunfighter."
scene_heading: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
dialog: What was this book Hummel wrote on Vietnam?
dialog: Anybody read it?
speaker_heading: RAYDEN SINCLAIR
dialog: No. Give me the skinny.
speaker_heading: GENERAL KRAMER
dialog: The "skinny," Mr. Sinclair, is that the U.S. should have
dialog: either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting
dialog: American lives. I happen to share General Hummells view.
text: The door opens. A NAVAL ATTACHE pokes his head in.
speaker_heading: NAVAL ATTACHE
text: General, it's him. The call connects to a phone on the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: GENERAL KRAMER
dialog: Frank, this is Albert Kramer.
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: Hello Al. Howlre Judy and the kids?
speaker_heading: GENERAL KRAMER
dialog: They're fine. I'm with General Peterson, F.B.I.
dialog: Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security Advisor Lindstrom,
dialog: and C.I.A. Director Amway. You've got a lot of people worried, Frank.
dialog: Can you help us out?
scene_heading: INTERCUT - PENTAGON and ALCATRAZ as necessary.
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three
dialog: Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands.
dialog: Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China ...
speaker_heading: HAYDEN SINCLAIR
dialog: Southern China? We never admitted we sent troops into
dialog: China.

speaker_heading: HUMMEL

speaker_heading: HAYDEN SINCLAIR
dialog: White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General.
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair.
speaker_heading: RAYDEN SINCLAIR
dialog: I'm thirty-three.
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday
dialog: I had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed
dialog: that many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat,
dialog: ignorant mouth. He has shit for brains and he is wasting my time.
text: Sinclair's irritation is relieved by the Naval Attache, entering again,
text: who hands him a phone and whispers:
speaker_heading: NAVAL ATTACHE
text: The President calling from Moscow.
text: Sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone, speaking
dialog: sotto voice.
speaker_heading: GENERAL KRAMER
dialog: Continue Frank.
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
text: Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and
dialog: El Salvador. Remember the Gulf War. Those pretty "smart bomb" pictures
dialog: on C.N.N.? My men lased those targets. Ten were left to rot outside
dialog: Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu,
dialog: gentlemen. No benefits were paid to their families; no medals
dialog: conferred. These men died for their country and they weren't even given
text: a coddamn military burial.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This situation will not stand: you
dialog: will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman "Red Sea Trading
dialog: Company" account to an account I designate. From these funds,
dialog: reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83
dialog: marines, families. The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's
dialog: expenses. Am I clear?
scene_heading: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
dialog: Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: Identify yourself.
scene_heading: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
dialog: F.B.I. Director Womack, General.
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the
dialog: Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.
speaker_heading: GENERAL KRAMER
dialog: Frank, Jesus, this is classified information.
speaker_heading: WOMACK
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Is this true?
text: General Kramer, embarrassed, nods yes.
speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney

text: Hayden Sinclair returns to the table.
speaker_heading: HAYDEN SINCLAIR
dialog: General, I've just spoken to the President and he is

speaker_heading: HUMMEL
dialog: Someone please gag that man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Alert the media, I launch the gas. Refuse payment, I launch the gas.
dialog: It is just after midnight. You have 36 hours - all of today and half
dialog: of tomorrow, until 12 noon - to transfer the money. Don't even consider
dialog: the standard counter measure, General.
speaker_heading: GENERAL KRAMER
dialog: What's the potential casualty rate of a single rocket

speaker_heading: GENERAL PETERSON
text: In a dense urban area, sixty, seventy ...
speaker_heading: RAYDEN SINCLAIR
dialog: Well that's not so bad ...
speaker_heading: I GENERAL PETERSON
dialog: Thousand. Seventy thousand. Dead. one teaspoon will
dialog: kill all living organisms in a three story office building. Get the
dialog: point?
scene_heading: F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK
dialog: What did Hummel mean by ",standard countermeasure," General?
speaker_heading: GENERAL PETERSON
dialog: Napalm. Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm.
text: It burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation. The problem is
text: that V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm.
dialog: Hummel must know about Willy Peter, General.
speaker_heading: GENERAL KRAMER
dialog: 'Course he does.
dialog: (explaining to others)
dialog: "Willy Peter," short for "White Phosphorous Incendiary Device," still
text: in its test phase. It detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up V.X.
dialog: (dawning on him)
dialog: That explains Hummells time frame. He knows we're not
dialog: operational. What would it take, General?
speaker_heading: GENERAL PETERSON
dialog: To equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36
dialog: hours? An act of God.
dialog: (off Kramer's look)
dialog: All right, we can try. But
dialog: view the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative.
speaker_heading: GENERAL KRAMER
dialog: Then on to our primary initiative. (hits intercom button)
dialog: Send in S.E.A.L. Team Leader Anderson. (to F.B.I. Womack) Who's your

dialog: route he took through the island's tunnels.
speaker_heading: AGENT SANCHEZ
dialog: You want him conscious or unconscious afterward?
