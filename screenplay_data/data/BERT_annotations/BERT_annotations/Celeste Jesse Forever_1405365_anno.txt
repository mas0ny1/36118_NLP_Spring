speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Well, it's not just her. It's
dialog: everyone behind her too. So, if you
dialog: want to ask all these people if

dialog: Senior year of college, we had a
dialog: tradition. Every Sunday, come rain
dialog: or shine, Beth and Tucker would
dialog: meet me and Jesse at the Bishop
text: with a 12-pack of Miller High Life,
dialog: the champagne of beers, and we
dialog: would meet to talk about what was
dialog: important in the world, you know,
dialog: Heidegger's influence on hip-hop.
dialog: Or the feminist duality on "Melrose
dialog: Place." Life's big questions. Beth
dialog: and Tucker were just friends then
dialog: but there was always something
dialog: there. Just an ease they had with
dialog: each other. Jesse and I spent years
dialog: trying to get them together,
dialog: unsuccessfully.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
dialog: But we all remained friends and

dialog: 
text: Tucker flinches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
text: Finally, he removed his head from
text: his ass, and saw what was in front
dialog: of him. And that was beautiful
dialog: Beth. And none of us could be
dialog: happier about it; they were
text: perfect. At last. Love wins.
dialog: 
text: Wedding guests clap. They think it's over. It's not.

speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
dialog: Um...Jesse and I are getting a
dialog: divorce. So that's...yeah, our
dialog: timing was not as good, I guess.
dialog: Beth and Tucker, you are lucky to
dialog: be best friends. Work hard and
dialog: respect that. It doesn't come
dialog: easily. Be patient, don't always
dialog: think you're right. And if you are,
dialog: it doesn't fucking matter anyway.
