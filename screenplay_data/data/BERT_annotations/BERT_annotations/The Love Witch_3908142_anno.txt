scene_heading: TO THE READER:
text: This is a tale of witchcraft, told as a simple family of
dialog: seventeenth century New England might have believed it to be. All
text: of their folkloric and religious beliefs, in this film, are true.
text: It was inspired by various folktales, fairytales and recorded
dialog: accounts (journals, diaries, court records etc.) of historical
dialog: witches and possessions from New England and Western Europe before
text: the Salem outbreak in 1692. Much of the dialogue, in fact, comes
dialog: directly from those sources.
dialog: In order to effectively depict this world in which ordinary people
dialog: understood supernatural occurrences to be an expected part of
dialog: life, it is essential that all aspects of the film to be carried
text: out with utter naturalism. The characters must appear as real
text: farmers, not actors with dirty faces. Even the supernatural
text: elements must be photographed as realistically as possible. Yet,
dialog: with all this authenticity and “realism," it is still a folktale,
text: a dream. A nightmare from the past.
speaker_heading: BLACK.
text: TITLE: THE WITCH.
dialog: A New-England Folktale.
scene_heading: INT. MEETING HOUSE. SALEM PLANTATION - DAY - 1630s - MARCH
text: CLOSE ON: THOMASIN (13) listening attentively. Her sweet farm-
text: girl's face is utterly still. Afraid. Tense. Confused.
text: A low, deliberate, voice echoes through the wooden church:
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (0.S.)
dialog: What went we out into this
dialog: wilderness to find? Leaving our
dialog: country, kindred, our father’s
dialog: houses? We have travailed a vast
dialog: ocean... For what?
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR (0.S.)
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: We must ask thee to be silent!
text: CLOSE ON: CALEB (11), THOMASIN’S brother. He doesn’t blink,
text: just listens. Fear in his belly.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM DEPUTY GOVERNOR (0.S.)
dialog: (overlapping) (overlapping)
dialog: Was it not for the pure and No More!
dialog: faithful dispensation of the
dialog: Gospels and the Kingdom of
dialog: God?
speaker_heading: MINISTER (0.S.)
dialog: We are your judges, and not you
dialog: ours!
text: MEDIUM WIDE: THOMASIN & CALEB stand in a row beside the
scene_heading: TWINS, JONAS & MERCY (5) and their PREGNANT MOTHER,
text: KATHERINE, WHOSE FACE WE DO NOT SEE. JUST THE CHILDREN.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (0.S.)
dialog: I cannot be judged by false
dialog: contented Christians under an un-
dialog: separated church! An English
dialog: king’s church.
scene_heading: WIDE, REVERSE: WE REVEAL THE GOVERNOR, THE MINISTER AND OTHER
text: BLACK CLOTHED DIGNITARIES sitting at a long table on a raised
text: platform in front of the pulpit. Their dour faces are
text: exasperated.
text: WILLIAM, back to camera, stands below them in the center of
text: the primitive church. His family by his side.
text: The whole congregation of about fifty men, women and children
text: are all crammed together, all standing in heavy silence. Men
text: on one side, women on the other.
text: Their eyes on WILLIAM.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: Must you continue to dishonor the
dialog: laws of the commonwealth and the
dialog: church with your prideful conceit?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: If my conscience sees it fit.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: Then shall you be banished out of
dialog: this plantation’s liberties!
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I would be glad on it.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: Then take your leave, and trouble
dialog: us no further.
text: CLOSE ON: WILLIAM’s eyes burn indignantly below his furrowed
dialog: brow.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: How sadly hath The Lord testified
dialog: against you.
text: He turns to walk out of the meeting house.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Katherine.
text: MED: THE CHILDREN, scared and confused, are yanked through
text: THE THRONG OF ANGRY PURITANS by their FATHER AND MOTHER.
text: THOMASIN stays still. Shocked.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Come along now. Come along.
text: THOMASIN doesn’t move. She doesn’t want to leave. Her
text: brother grabs her in the commotion.
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: Thomasin! Come.
scene_heading: EXT. SALEM PLANTATION GATE - EARLY MORNING
text: The view of the pitiful, snow-covered MEDIEVAL-LOOKING
text: VILLAGE disappears as TWO MILITIA MEN slowly close the
text: plantation’s tall PALISADE DOORS. A FEW NAUMKEAG TRADERS
text: with painted faces and A ROUGH LOOKING WHITE MAN stand near
dialog: by with their goods.
text: THOMASIN, CALEB, THE TWINS, and FOWLER THE DOG, watch the
text: doors close as they rock back and forth sitting in a rickety
text: two-wheeled CART.
text: WILLIAM walks alongside the workhorse pulling a cart strapped
text: with a trunk, a chair, clinking pots and pans and few other
dialog: miscellaneous articles. Surely not enough to survive on.
text: KATHERINE, sits in the cart with the children. She sings:
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: (sings)
dialog: I will confess Jehovah with all
dialog: heart in secret and in assembly of
dialog: the just.
text: THOMASIN rests her head on KATHERINE’S PREGNANT BELLY.
text: KATHERINE strokes THOMASIN’S hair. THOMASIN LOOKS BACK TOWARD
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE PLANTATION.
text: THOMASIN joins her hymn:
scene_heading: KATHERINE & THOMASIN
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Great are the works of our Lord,
dialog: sought out of all that in them do
dialog: delight.
dialog: EVERYONE joins:
speaker_heading: FAMILY
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Beautiful and glorious his work is,
dialog: and his righteousness endureth
dialog: forever...
text: All but WILLIAM keep their eyes on the safe PLANTATION WALLS
text: as they head into a VAST UNTOUCHED WILDERNESS. Their song of
text: hope slowly fading away.
dialog: Hold.
scene_heading: EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY
text: THE FAMILY as they travel slowly in the light March snow.
text: Nature envelopes them.
text: They walk on.

dialog: Hold.
speaker_heading: BLACK.
scene_heading: EXT. A CLEARING - AFTERNOON
text: WILLIAM LIES FACE DOWN ON THE HALF FROZEN GROUND. HIS EYES
speaker_heading: CLOSED.
text: He sits up, the warm afternoon light hitting his hopeful,
text: teary cheeks. He lifts his hands toward heaven.
text: The wind blows.
text: KATHERINE takes his hand. THE FAMILY is in a circle, on
text: their knees, in joyful, silent prayer. Their faces beaming.
text: Before them is a BEAUTIFUL, IDYLLIC NATURAL CLEARING OF
text: ROLLING HILLS...
text: but... the clearing is surrounded by a FOREST - A DARK AND
scene_heading: ANCIENT WOOD. ITS ENORMOUS PINES STAND LIKE GIANTS ABOVE THE
speaker_heading: FAMILY.
text: THE PRESENCE OF THE WOOD IS PROFOUND, DISTURBING, OMINOUS.
text: But the family is wrapped in prayer.
scene_heading: BLACK. HOLD.
text: AUDIO: The wind blows.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SAME CLEARING —- DAWN - NOVEMBER
text: It is now late autumn. Anorexic CORNSTALKS are scattered
text: across a muddy field.
text: A FLEDGLING FARM sits on top of a hill at the foot of THE
text: WOOD. MONSTROUS TREES loom over THE RAMSHACKLE COTTAGE. Its
text: crooked clapboards to are beginning to grey and the gabled
text: thatch to brown. Behind the house are a few shoddy structures
dialog: and scrap-wood fences for keeping in the small amount of
text: livestock. The frame of the INCOMPLETE BARN looks as if it
dialog: will collapse at any moment. Tools and raw lumber littler
dialog: the yard.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING
text: CLOSE ON: THOMASIN. Her large blue eyes gaze earnestly
text: toward heaven. Her chin rests on little dirty fingers. She
text: says her words with surprising acceptance:
speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: O most merciful father: I here
dialog: confess I have lived in sin.
dialog: I have been idle of my work,
dialog: disobedient of mine parents,
dialog: neglectful of my prayer. I have, in
dialog: secret, played upon thy sabbath and
dialog: broken every one of thy
dialog: commandments in thought... followed
dialog: the desires of my own will, and not
dialog: the holy Spirit. I know I deserve
dialog: all shame and misery in this life,
dialog: and everlasting hell-fire. But I
dialog: beg thee, for the sake of thy Son.
dialog: Forgive me. Show me mercy. Show
dialog: me thy light.
dialog: I thank thee that thou hast
dialog: defended me this night, and brought
dialog: me safe unto this day. These and
dialog: all other graces, I beg at thy
dialog: hands in that prayer which Christ
dialog: himself hath taught me:
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING
scene_heading: MED CLOSE: KATHERINE BREAST FEEDS SAMUEL, THE BABY, now 6

dialog: hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
dialog: come.
scene_heading: EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY
text: WIDE: WILLIAM AND CALEB have their backs to camera working in
text: a patchy, dying cornfield. Their clothes now well worn.
text: WILLIAM cuts the corn from the stalks. CALEB bundles the
text: chaff into shocks. JONAS AND MERCY fill baskets of with the
dialog: ears of corn. It is hard repetitive work for all. But they
dialog: are used to it.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (V.O.)
dialog: Thy will be done even in earth, as
dialog: it is in heaven. Give us this day
dialog: our daily bread.
scene_heading: EXT. GOAT SHED - LATER THAT DAY
text: MED WIDE: THOMASIN shovels dung out of the shed.
text: It is heavy. But she is used to it.

scene_heading: EXT. FARMYARD - AFTERNOON
text: MED TRACKING: KATHERINE hands THE BABY to THOMASIN.
text: KATHERINE needs both of her hands to stoke the fire of the
text: outdoor bake-oven. THOMASIN walks away with SAM THE BABY,
text: disappearing into the cloud of grey smoke.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (V.O.)
dialog: And lead us not into temptation,
dialog: but deliver us from evil: for thine
dialog: is the kingdom, and the power, and
dialog: the glory for ever. Amen.
speaker_heading: BLACK.
text: AUDIO: THE BABY’S LAUGHTER is heard. Then, THOMASIN’S playful
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (0.S.)
dialog: Where’s Sam? Where is Sam?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (Pause).
dialog: Peeeeeeep...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD - DUSK
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (0.S.)
dialog: Boo!
text: CLOSE ON: SAMUEL, THE BABY, is lying in the grass.
text: He is stunned, smiling with huge baby eyes and a little wet
dialog: mouth.
dialog: HE SQUEALS WITH LAUGHTER! Too adorable!
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: There you are! There you are!
text: SAMUEL laughs more and more. He is clearly being tickled!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK.
text: SAMUEL'S laughter subsides. He breathes heavily, almost
dialog: panting.
text: He lets out a quiet half-laugh. He sounds worried.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Peeeeeep...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Boo!
text: CLOSE ON: SAMUEL. He shrieks with laughter again! He raises
text: his arms up and down in delight and kicks his legs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: Where is Sam? Where’s Sam? Where is

speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Peeeeeeep...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: LOW CLOSE ON: THOMASIN, kneeling on the ground. She uncovers
text: her big sparkling eyes in the “peek-a-boo” fashion and
dialog: shouts:
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Boo!
text: Her rosy-cheeked face is frozen in joy.
text: Suddenly, her eyes register what is in front of her...
text: Her compelling smile disappears... Her face loses all
dialog: color...
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Sam?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE ON: Nothing. The dead grass where SAMUEL had been
dialog: lying.
text: All is silent except for THOMASIN’S panicking breath. Where
dialog: is he?
text: The wind blows.
text: THE CAMERA slowly tilts up through the tall grass and weeds,
dialog: toward...
text: «+. THE WOOD.
text: The wild grass that leads to the edge of THE WOOD is MOVING
text: SLIGHTLY, as if something had just run through it.
text: THOMASIN screams:
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Sam! Samuel!!
text: THOMASIN runs into frame and stops, STARING INTO THE OPENING
text: OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST. IT SEEMS TO BECKON HER.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (CONT'D)
dialog: SAM!!!
scene_heading: EXT. THE WOOD - NIGHTFALL
text: The autumn mist is thick. Boney-fingered branches crack in
dialog: the wind.
text: A SMALL HUNCHED FIGURE in a tattered RED CLOAK hobbles
text: quickly through the enormous mossy trees.
text: A distorted old breath comes from under THE RED HOOD,
text: wheezing, trying to keep pace. From a little lower in the
text: cloak comes the sound of a gargling BABY. One of SAMUEL'S
text: HANDS pokes out.
text: Dusk is at its end.
scene_heading: INT. THE WITCH’S HOVEL - NIGHT
text: DARKNESS. It is almost impossible to see.
text: Passing through the shadows, extremely old and bent HANDS
text: with long dirty talons briefly catch the firelight. They
text: place SAMUEL upon the center of a crude table. Overwhelmed by
text: the dark, he senses the danger. His delicate baby FINGERS
text: open and close reflexively, grasping at the air.
text: Seen in flickering glimpses, the greasy RED CLOAK falls to
text: the dirt floor. TINY FEET step around THE CLOAK and kick off
text: square-toed shoes. Jagged, fungal toe-nails poke out of
text: soiled wool stockings.
text: THE OLD HANDS grab the BABY’S COLLAR, tear open his linen
text: shift, and strip it off the child. SAMUEL starts to cry.
text: THE FIGURE steps away from the table, her back to camera.
text: Hobbling in and out of blackness of the hovel, she takes off
text: her bonnet and scanty grey locks fall to her shoulders,
text: snaking across her bent spine. She removes the rest of her
text: filthy clothes, and for an instant, HER NAKED BODY is
text: revealed... before she moves back into shadow.
text: HER HANDS reach up to the low THATCH CEILING, over THE BABY,
text: and tear out a mossy clump. Little bits of dirt and reed, and
text: other natural scantlings fall on SAMUEL. BRIGHT MOONLIGHT
text: shines through the hole, bathing the child in its light.
text: OFF SCREEN, THE OLD WOMAN hums a haunting song. Her HANDS
text: stroke the baby tenderly and pinches the fatty areas around
text: his thighs and biceps.
text: Her HAND take a LARGE RUSTY KNIFE... she holds it up over the
text: child's breast... she continues to hum her song...
text: CAMERA ON: The humpback and scabby head of THE OLD WOMAN...
text: She brings the knife up... and then down in a swift motion!
text: (WE DO NOT SEE THE BABY, only the back of THE OLD WOMAN)
dialog: 10.
text: AUDIO: CHOP! THE BABY WAILS.
speaker_heading: - LATER
text: Back to camera, THE OLD WOMAN'S SILHOUETTE sits by a low-
text: burning fire.
text: She grinds at her MORTAR AND PESTLE. One can easily assume
dialog: its contents.
text: Scattered beside her are a messy assortment of EARTHEN JARS.
text: Each jar emits a more awful stench than the other.
speaker_heading: - LATER
text: THE FIRE IS OUT.
text: Illuminated in the dimmest traces of moonlight, THE OLD WOMAN
text: has A THICK BLOODY GREASE in her hands. She rubs this UNGUENT
text: all over her NAKED BODY.
speaker_heading: - MOMENTS LATER
text: She rubs THE UNGUENT on THE WOODEN HANDLE OF A BROOMSITCK. It
text: foams around her thumb and forefinger.
speaker_heading: - MOMENTS LATER
text: CAMERA ON HER BACK: Barely visible, THE NAKED OLD WOMAN
text: stands near the hearth.
text: She mounts THE BROOM.
text: She is still.
text: Suddenly, her head moves. First a jerk, then it slows. Her
text: gaze going upward.
text: Her eyes roll to the back of her head and her eyelids flutter
text: in and out of the moonlight. Her face remains unseen.
text: SHE TREMBLES AND COLLAPSES TO THE GROUND.
text: SHE BREATHES HEAVILY AND RHYTHMICALLY, GROANING AND GROANING,
text: TREMORING IN THE DIRT AND DARKNESS.
text: SHE GRIPS THE BROOMSTICK FIRMLY.
scene_heading: EXT. THE WITCH’S HOVEL - NIGHT
text: LOW WIDE: Shadowed by a confusion of twisted branches, THE
scene_heading: WITCH RISES AWAY FROM CAMERA - SLOWLY, WEIRDLY, PHANTOM-LIKE
text: -— THROUGH THE THATCH SMOKE-HOLE OF HER ROOF, ASCENDING INTO
dialog: 11.
text: THE NIGHT TOWARD THE MOON.
text: Her naked body scrapes against the branches, clicking,
text: clacking and cracking as she rises. “Clickety-clackety,
dialog: clickety-clackety, clickety-clackety.”
scene_heading: BLACK. HOLD.
text: AUDIO: A rooster crows. Other quite farm noises.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE, GARRET - DAWN
text: A WOODEN SHUTTER is unlatched from a small glass-less window.
text: A WOMAN'S MUFFLED CRYING AND MUMBLING IS HEARD.
text: Dim dawn light hits CALEB’S gaunt, freckled face. His light
text: eyes are full of worries. Painfully anxious.
text: The dawn glows red.
text: CALEB picks up his homespun doublet. He stumbles quietly over
text: and through the pile of sleeping SWEATY-FACED SIBLINGS and
text: straw mattresses on the floor. Dwindling food stores hang
text: from the pitched ceiling, almost knocking his head.
text: MERCY is curled up with JONAS, who sucks his thumb.
text: THOMASIN has JONAS’ DIRTY FEET near her FACE.
text: As CALEB takes a big step, THOMASIN moves in her sleep.
text: CALEB looks down and notices THE SIDE OF HIS SISTER’S BREAST
text: in her somewhat open shift, and her faint armpit hair.
dialog: Pause.
text: Embarrassed, CALEB looks away.
text: THOMASIN moves again. Blankets rustle.
dialog: CALEB look back:
text: THOMASIN’S face is contorted in pain. Her eyes twitch under
text: her eyelids. SHE IS HAVING A NIGHTMARE.
text: CALEB hesitates. He kneels down and gently shakes her
dialog: shoulders:
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: (whispers, almost
dialog: inaudible)
dialog: Thomasin.
dialog: 12.
text: CALEB shakes her again...
speaker_heading: CALEB (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: Thomasin.
text: THOMASIN’S EYES OPEN and she gasps clenching her fists.
text: CALEB puts his hand gently over her mouth. She jerks,
text: disoriented.
text: CALEB pantomimes a “shh” with his other hand. They pause.
text: THEY LISTEN TO THEIR MOTHER'S WEEPING AND PRAYING from
dialog: downstairs...
text: CALEB uncovers THOMASIN’S mouth. She looks at him.
dialog: Pause.
text: THOMASIN’S face is as mournful as their mother’s weeping. Her
text: eyes beg for comfort.
speaker_heading: CALEB (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispers, almost
dialog: inaudible)
dialog: Sleep. All will be well. Sleep.
text: CALEB keeps his eyes on his sister till she reluctantly lies
text: back in bed.
text: Then, he climbs down the rickety ladder to...
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: «+. the ground floor of the family’s extremely primitive one-
text: room home. The stench of squalor and smoke hangs in the air.
text: FOWLER THE DOG, is near an EMPTY WOODEN CRADLE. He is up too.
text: CALEB steps over his parent’s chamber pot, and pushes a
text: wandering HEN away from his shoes that are near his parent’s
dialog: bedside.
text: He can still hear his MOTHER crying softly from behind the
text: shabby bed curtains. THE DOG whines and tries to peek in.
text: CALEB turns his head to the door and puts on his doublet.
text: THE FRONT DOOR is half open...
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FARM - CONTINUOUS
text: CALEB walks out the door... past a TALL PILE OF STACKED
text: FIREWOOD... past the chopping block and AXE...
scene_heading: EXT. THE FARM/CORNFIELD - CONTINUOUS
text: -.. He continues toward THE SILHOUETTED FIGURE at the bottom
text: of the hill in the CORNFIELD. It’s WILLIAM.
text: CALEB approaches tentatively.
text: He gently touches WILLIAM'S shoulder...
text: He is startled and turns:
text: He sees his son out of the corner of his eye, peeking through
text: his long thinning hair. HE TURNS AWAY.
text: His smoky voice rumbles:
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Caleb.
text: CALEB tries to initiate contact.
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: God give you good morrow.
dialog: (Pause. )
text: WILLIAM frowns, biting on a his mustache and beard.
text: His coarse hand holds an EAR OF INDIAN CORN. His wide-brimmed
text: hat is in the other. THE CORN IS SHRIVELED, HALF GROWN AND
text: ROTTING. A DISGUSTING MALIGNANT FUNGUS is bursting between
text: its kernels.
text: CHICKENS cluck several yards away.
speaker_heading: CALEB (CONT'D)
dialog: All are still a-bed.
dialog: (Pause. )
dialog: Save Mother.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: No ease to rise on a grey day. The
dialog: Devil holds fast your eyelids.
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: I‘’ll wake ‘em.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Let ‘em be.
text: CALEB looks surprised.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Thy mother’s not slept a night
dialog: since.
text: WILLIAM looks at the ground.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: We can search no longer, Caleb. We
dialog: cannot. If not a wolf, hunger’d
dialog: have taken him yet.
dialog: Pause.
text: WILLIAM looks at the devastated cornfield. Disfigured corpses
text: of infected corn-ears lay upon the grey soil.
text: WILLIAM THROWS THE EAR OF CORN HE HAS BEEN HOLDING WITH ALL
text: HIS MIGHT. It disappears into the hazy dawn.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s to The Wood.
text: CALEB looks very surprised.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been a-laying traps for some
dialog: while - before even this new
dialog: misery.
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: Within The Wood?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Will you not help thy father?
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: You and mother have always forbad
dialog: us to set foot there.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: This is our home now. Fear it not.
dialog: Eh? Did not we build our house of
dialog: timbers?
dialog: (Pause. )
dialog: We must conquer this wood. It will
dialog: not consume us.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: Perchance you snared that wolf.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Aye. Fetch thy hat, tis bitter
dialog: cold.
text: WILLIAM smiles hopefully at CALEB again and touches his bare
dialog: head.
text: CALEB smiles back and runs toward the house.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: And the gun.
scene_heading: EXT. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD - EARLY MORNING
text: WILLIAM is only a small speck beneath the THREATENING TREES.
text: The thick trunks moan and creak, swaying ever so slightly in
dialog: the wind.
text: He walks quietly into the darkness of THE WOOD.
text: CALEB stands still, several paces back with FOWLER THE DOG.
text: HE HOLDS HIS FATHER’S MUSKET.
text: CALEB looks up at the high treetops, afraid to enter.
text: FOWLER whimpers a little.
dialog: WILLIAM calls from within:
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (0.S.)
dialog: Caleb!
text: Caleb catches up and crosses THE FORBIDDEN THRESHOLD.
scene_heading: EXT. THE WOOD - EARLY MORNING
text: Father and son walk in the early morning mist, FOWLER by
dialog: their side.
text: Their wooden powder flasks clink and clatter against their
text: bony chests.
text: Grey leaves crunch beneath their feet.
text: A dense pine canopy bristles above them, shadowing the forest
text: floor. CALEB’S LESSON echoes through the trees:
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Art thou then born holy and
dialog: righteous?
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: No, nay! My first father sinned and
dialog: I in him.
dialog: CALEB wants to be serious, however, with all the danger and
text: excitement a small but uncontrollable grin has appeared on
text: his face. He recites with pride:
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Art thou then born a sinner?
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: Aye. I was conceived in sin, and
dialog: born in - iniquity.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Good. Then what is thy birth sin?
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: Adam's sin imputed to me, and a
dialog: corrupt nature dwelling within me.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Well-remembered Caleb. Very well.
dialog: And canst thou tell me what thy
dialog: corrupt nature is?
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: My corrupt nature is empty of
dialog: grace, bent unto sin, only unto
dialog: sin, and that continually.
text: CALEB pauses for a moment. THE WORDS OF HIS CATECHISM SINKING
dialog: IN.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Soft now.
text: They come upon a LARGE OVERTURNED TREE. Its sprawling root
text: system is far taller than WILLIAM.
text: CALEB watches WILLIAM find a TRAP he had laid near it.
text: WILLIAM kicks THE TRAP softly with the toe of his boot.
text: IT IS SHUT. THERE IS NO CATCH.
text: WILLIAM hides his disappointment.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: We must lay’t again.
text: CALEB goes to the trap. He stops himself from touching the
text: big iron teeth. He looks imploringly at his father. May I set
dialog: it?
text: WILLIAM nods and smiles affirmatively.
text: CALEB bends down to open the jaws. He struggles a bit.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, mind thy hand Caleb. Mind thy
dialog: hand.
text: CALEB slows his work... thinking again:
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: Was... was Samuel born a sinner?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM pauses.
dialog: He nods “yes.”
dialog: CALEB was expecting that answer.
speaker_heading: CALEB (CONT'D)
dialog: How might then -
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: We pray he hath entered God’s
dialog: Kingdom.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: What wickedness hath he done?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Place faith in God - Caleb, mind
dialog: thy hand, I say.
dialog: (Pause. )
dialog: We'll speak no more on thy brother.
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM

dialog: are still closed.
text: She walks forward slowly and peeks in through some frayed

scene_heading: EXT. FARMYARD - LATER
text: CLOSE ON: THOMASIN, still affected by the sight of her
dialog: mother.
text: She carries a heavy pail of water on her head, bracing it
text: with one hand. She can’t hold it up very well and the ground

text: water sloshes out of the bucket on to her shoulders, soaking
text: her. She shudders with frustration.
text: She puts the bucket down for a moment to wipe her cold nose.

scene_heading: INT. GOAT SHED - LATER

speaker_heading: CALEB (CONT'D)

dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: CALEB (CONT'D)
dialog: Father?!
text: WILLIAM sits up, but cannot look CALEB in the eye.
text: CALEB puts his hand on his FATHER’S shoulder.
speaker_heading: CALEB (CONT'D)
dialog: We’ll make a catch father, I know
dialog: it.
text: WILLIAM gives in and embraces CALEB tightly for a moment.
text: FOWLER wanders over and kisses WILLIAM’S blackened face.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM

speaker_heading: THOMASIN

dialog: That's how I signed his book.
speaker_heading: MERCY
dialog: No!
text: THOMASIN grows more serious in her play.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: He bade me bring him an unbaptized

text: EVERYONE is at the table in prayer.
text: Food is very scant.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)

dialog: For as we hunger for this food of

speaker_heading: KATHERINE (CONT’D)
dialog: Didst not bed them down before
dialog: supper? Thomasin?
scene_heading: EXT. FARMYARD - NIGHT
text: Another bleat, even wilder. The frightening sound echoes in
dialog: the night.
text: THOMASIN walks alone with a lantern to THE GOAT SHED. Her
text: cloak has been hastily thrown on.
text: The darkness of the farmyard is heavy on her.
text: She can faintly hear CALEB reading from The Bible.
text: As she walks, something moves in the trees.
text: She turns her head to the treetops and hears the “clickety-
dialog: clackety.”
dialog: Pause.
text: Her breath quickens.
text: She walks closer, cautiously, slowly.
text: A terrible screeching and grunting coming from the GOAT SHED.
text: She walks closer to the open door... she holds up her lamp...
text: INSIDE, BLACK PHILLIP IS VIOLENTLY COPULATING WITH ONE OF THE
dialog: 
text: NANNY GOATS. THE NANNY GOAT screams as she tries to pull away

speaker_heading: KATHERINE

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Katherine, I must tell thee-
speaker_heading: KATHERINE

dialog: We might have sold it.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: What?

speaker_heading: THOMASIN (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?

speaker_heading: CALEB

speaker_heading: CALEB

speaker_heading: THOMASIN

speaker_heading: THOMASIN (CONT'D)
dialog: As you like.

speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: If thou wilt back to sleep, and
dialog: keep silent of this, I promise
dialog: thee, you’ll need not leave to
dialog: serve the Tildens nor any family
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: Caleb -

dialog: 49.
scene_heading: EXT. THE WOOD - EARLY MORNING
text: The Wood is still dark.
text: THOMASIN rides BURT. CALEB is on foot, holding the reins and

text: FOWLER trots along beside them.
text: CALEB has the musket. The match-cord is lit.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - MORNING

speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: Well?
text: CALEB turns to her with a smile! They’ve made a catch!
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - DAY
text: CALEB and THOMASIN move now with a swifter, more assured
dialog: pace.
text: A muskrat and other small game hang from the horse’s tack.
dialog: Their spirits are light:
speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: Aye but we did!
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: Nay.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: We did.
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: THOMASIN

speaker_heading: CALEB
speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: Dost not remember Fowler laying on
dialog: the floor i’the sun? You must! And

speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: Nay.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: You do! And where the sun would
dialog: shine, would he warm himself. (to
dialog: Fowler) Wouldn’t you, thou idler?
dialog: Remember once he lay upon the
dialog: table, and Father saw him and he
dialog: saith “we will have him for meat!
dialog: Kate, Kate! We will roast this
dialog: beast”(she laughs). You must
dialog: remember that!
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: I remember that day, but no glass.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: Well...
text: THOMASIN is very frustrated that Caleb cannot remember... and
text: finds herself surprisingly emotional about this window.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...it was pretty.
text: Suddenly, FOWLER starts tracking something.
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: What is’t boy?
speaker_heading: FOWLER POINTS:
text: CALEB and THOMASIN look ahead.
dialog: 51.
text: Standing about fifty yards before them is same giant HARE
dialog: from yesterday!
text: BURT IS SPOOKED. He neighs and clomps around, kicking up dirt
text: and tossing his head up oddly. THOMASIN holds tight to the
text: work saddle. CALEB tries to keep his footing.
speaker_heading: CALEB (CONT'D)
dialog: Burt, calm thee.
text: THOMASIN pats BURT to calm him and CALEB gives her the reins.
text: THE HARE stays motionless, looking straight at CALEB.
text: CALEB carefully prepares the musket.
text: He takes aim... He shouts:
speaker_heading: CALEB (CONT'D)
dialog: Fowler, thence!
text: FOWLER RUNS toward THE HARE, barking loudly!
text: BURT neighs again, going rampant, nearly knocking THOMASIN
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: Burt!

text: FOWLER FOLLOWS HIM AND DISAPPEARS!
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: Fowler Nay! Fowler!

speaker_heading: CALEB

dialog: 52.
text: THE HORSE REARS AND BUCKS AGAIN, KNOCKING THOMASIN TO THE

speaker_heading: THUD!
text: THOMASIN IS LEFT UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FOREST FLOOR.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - LATER
text: CALEB travels deeper into The Wood, running.
text: THE TREES have become more indiscernible from one another.
text: Tall seemingly identical trunks stand looming in every
text: direction. He stops, panting. He turns around.
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: Thomasin? Thomasin!
text: He hears nothing.
text: He tries to whistle for Fowler like his father does. It comes
text: out airy and quiet.
speaker_heading: CALEB (CONT'D)
dialog: Folwer!
text: He attempts to whistle again. It doesn't work.
scene_heading: EXT. FARM YARD - LATER
text: JONAS AND MERCY are tethered to a long rope tied to the fence
text: so they cannot wander from the farm. THE GOAT-BELLS from the
text: nanny goats have also been tied to them.
speaker_heading: TWINS
dialog: Caleb! Caleb!
text: THE BELLS CLANK as they walk.
text: KATHERINE and WILLIAM are in the distant fields near THE WOOD

speaker_heading: KATHERINE & WILLIAM
dialog: (in the distance)
dialog: Caleb, lad! Thomasin!
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - AFTERNOON
text: THOMASIN wakes.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: Caleb?
text: SHE stand, uneasy. She looks around.
text: SHE knows where she is. She is near OVERTURNED TREE where
text: Caleb set the first trap.
dialog: How did she get there?
text: She turns back.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Caleb! Burt?!
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Caleb!!
text: She runs on toward home!
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - LATER
text: CALEB holds his musket ready. THE TREES and underbrush have
text: become even more dense and tangled.
text: He prays aloud as he walks:
speaker_heading: CALEB
dialog: O God my Lord, I now begin,
dialog: O help me and I'll leave my sin.
dialog: For I repentant now will be,
dialog: From evil I will turn to thee.
dialog: None ever shall destroy my faith,
dialog: Nor do I mind what Satan saith.
dialog: O God my Lord, I now begin,
dialog: O help me and I'll leave my sin -
text: He hears the yelp of the dog. It echoes in the wood.
text: He runs fast after the noise. He cannot see through the mist.
text: He keeps running.
dialog: Running.
text: He trips and falls.
text: IN FRONT OF HIM ARE THE BLOODY REMAINS OF FOWLER, STILL HOT,
text: STILL BREATHING HIS LAST BREATHS!
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - DUSK
text: THOMASIN clumsily weaves through crackling branches.
text: Daylight is waning.
text: She breaths heavily, trying to run, but she is exhausted.
text: All of a sudden, she hears something faint... voices!
text: They are almost inaudible:
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (0.S)
dialog: Caleb! Thomasin!
speaker_heading: KATHERINE (0.S.)
dialog: Caleb!
dialog: She picks up her pace!
scene_heading: EXT. A WINDING PATH - DUSK
text: CALEB trudges through a strange winding path of dense,
text: twisting, vines and thorns.
text: He tries to run, but the rain, fog, and spiky terrain slow
dialog: him down.
text: His stockings get caught on some thorns.
text: He recoils in pain and drops THE MUSKET.
text: He tries to disentangle himself, further cutting his fingers
dialog: and legs.
text: He tries to pick up the musket but it is caught in THE
text: THORNS. He pulls and pulls and it only makes things worse.
text: His hands bleed more. He is crying.
text: IN THE DISTANCE IS A SWEET MELODY. A WOMAN HUMMING.
text: He turns his head to find where the music is coming from.
text: A few yards in front of him is THE HARE!
text: THE HARE JUMPS AWAY.
text: CALEB FOLLOWS, LEAVING THE MUSKET IN THE RAIN.
scene_heading: EXT. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD - THE NEXT MOMENT
text: THOMASIN comes to the edge of the tree line and sees her
dialog: 55.
text: father in the last light of dusk.
speaker_heading: THOMASIN
dialog: Father! Father!
text: He hears her and runs toward her!
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Thomasin!
text: They meet, WILLIAM picks her up in his arms.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Thomasin! My girl.
text: He hugs her tight in the rain. He rubs his cheek on hers.
text: WILLIAM looks into her glassy eyes:
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is thy brother?
scene_heading: EXT. WITCH’S HOVEL - DUSK
text: CALEB emerges from the barbed path to see a faint warm light.
text: The humming is more distinct.
text: Through the mist and rain THE WITCH’S HOVEL becomes visible:
text: The pointed structure sits up high on four knotted tree
text: trunks. Matted branches overhang its sagging moss-grown
text: thatch-roof, upon which there is no chimney, just a hole
text: puffing smoke. The whole thing looks held together by ill-
text: omened weeds, plants, and sinister roots that grow all over
text: and through the muddy walls like a plague.
text: A rotting foot-ladder leads up to the slightly open front
text: door. Firelight glows from within.
text: CALEB continues to walk toward the humming. THE HARE is
text: nowhere to be seen.
text: He stumbles through a large FIRE PIT with BONES strewn about
text: the ground. Rain plinks on a huge IRON CAULDRON in the center
dialog: of the pit.
text: Just then, THE DOOR opens wider...
text: CALEB stops short.
text: Out steps a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (20s) IN A RED CLOAK. She smokes
text: a small CLAY PIPE.
dialog: 56.
text: CALEB steps back. He is soaking wet. He tries his best to
dialog: stop crying, to no avail.
text: THE WOMAN comes forward and her very dirty, but dainty, bare
text: foot takes one step down the foot ladder.
text: She leans forward. She reaches her arms out sympathetically
text: toward CALEB.
text: Her face is greasy, but stunning. Her filthy bodice is cut
text: quite low. There are a few small moles on her ample breast.
text: CALEB sees this all. He stays still. The rain falls.
text: THE WOMAN beckons him.
text: CALEB walks toward her, he is drawn to her. He can’t help
dialog: it.
text: She crouches on the foot ladder.
text: CALEB is now face to face with her.
text: She smiles at CALEB.
text: Some of her teeth are crooked and browned near the gums, it
text: is startling, but she is beautiful all the same.
text: She strokes CALEB’S head and embraces him.
text: Tears still fall from CALEB’S eyes. He trembles.
text: He looks at THE WOMAN’S face, he looks into her hypnotic
speaker_heading: AMBER EYES.
text: She smiles so sweetly.
text: She draws CALEB NEAR.
text: SHE KISSES CALEB SENSUALLY ON THE MOUTH!
text: SHE PULLS HIM IN TIGHTER...
scene_heading: SUDDENLY, HER HAND, NOW OLD AND UGLY, CREEPS AROUND AND GRABS
text: THE BACK OF HIS HEAD LIKE A CLAW. SHE PUSHES HIS MOUTH
text: FURTHER INTO HERS!!

speaker_heading: BLACK PHILLIP (0.S.)

speaker_heading: BLACK.
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF THE WOOD - NIGHT
text: WIDE, CAMERA ON HER BACK: THOMASIN rides naked on the back of
text: BLACK PHILLIP (a goat again), her hair falls freely behind
text: her. They journey deep into THE WOOD.
scene_heading: INT. THE WOOD - NIGHT
text: Now within the wood, the “clickety-clackety” of broomsticks
text: flying through trees above their heads is heard.
scene_heading: EXT. THE WITCH’S HOVEL - NIGHT
text: AS THOMASIN emerges from the path, she sees a freakish sight:
text: Half-visible in the darkness, still far from THOMASIN, are a
text: dozen women: old women, women in their middle years, young
text: women - all grotesque - some humpbacks and cripples. All
text: appear misshapen and distorted by the night. All of them are
text: filthy and nude or in strange patches and shreds of clothing.
text: They hold broomsticks, poles, distaffs and pitchforks.
text: THE WITCHES DANCE, gyrating, shaking, and quivering in a
text: trance-like reverie around a cauldron and fire in front of
text: THE WITCH'S HOVEL. Depraved. Subhuman. Bestial.
text: THOMASIN AND BLACK PHILLIP walk closer to the circle.
text: WHEN THE COVEN OF WITCHES sees them, they shriek and cackle
text: with delight - their faces contort from their laughter. THEY
text: WELCOME THOMASIN with their eyes.
text: THOMASIN, still astride BLACK PHILLIP, smiles. SHE JOINS THE
text: CIRCLE, laughing a little too, blushing... then laughs more
text: and more, WITH EVERY GROWING MOMENT HER SORROWS MELT AWAY.
dialog: 
text: VERY SLOWLY, AS THIS LAUGHTER INCREASES THE WITCHES BEGIN TO
text: LEVITATE AROUND THE FIRE, rising on their brooms and poles...
text: THEN, THOMASIN AND BLACK PHILLIP RISE TOO... SLOWLY GOING
dialog: 105.
scene_heading: HIGHER AND HIGHER.
text: THOMASIN KEEPS LAUGHING, EVER INCREASING IN PLEASURE AND
text: FREEDOM. TEARS ROLL DOWN HER CHEEKS AS SHE LAUGHS. PURE
speaker_heading: ECSTACY.
text: THEY RISE HIGHER.
scene_heading: BLACK. THE END.
