text: screaming fans at Madison Square Garden.
text: The sounds of a SCREAMING, CHEERING CROWD overwhelm us. Over
text: the images, RINGSIDE ANNOUNCERS boom commentary:
dialog: —"Oh, my! Ram hit with a devastating piledriver!”
dialog: —"I've never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!”
dialog: —"The Ayatollah taking it to The Ram outside the ring!”

scene_heading: INT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
text: Present day. Post-match. Randy, pushing 50, still with the
text: same long, dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys
text: locker room of a Wilmington, Delaware high school.
scene_heading: CHYRON: 20 YEARS LATER
text: He pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. Lime-green
text: ram’s horns run up the sides. They’re the same kind of tights
text: as in the ‘80s pics—and may well be the actual same pair.
text: Naked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath. Achy,
text: sweaty, saggy, exhausted. A battered warrior. Scars all over
text: his body. Despite the rough shape he’s in, it’s clear he’s
text: just given it his all in the ring. He swigs down a few pills
text: with a beer.
text: Promoter SCOTT BRUMBERG, a heavyset man in a Mets jersey with
text: BRUMBERG - 44 on the back, approaches.
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG
dialog: Great show, Ram. Ya turned it out.
dialog: (a little sad)
dialog: As always.
text: He hands Randy some cash. Randy counts it. It’s not much.
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT’D)
dialog: Sorry. I was sure the gate’d be
dialog: bigger.
text: Randy just shrugs resignedly.
scene_heading: EXT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Randy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the
text: school, each step labored and painful. Waiting near the
text: entrance are TWO FANS, both men in their 30s.
speaker_heading: FAN #1
dialog: Yo, Ram. Think you could...?
text: Fan #1 holds out a SHARPIE and an old WRESTLING PROGRAM from
text: the ‘80s. On the cover is a shot of Randy wrestling CORPORAL
text: PUNISHMENT, a heel in a drill instructor get-up.
text: Randy takes the program, happy to oblige.
speaker_heading: FAN #1 (CONT'D)
dialog: I was there.
text: Randy hands back the program. FAN #2 hands him a MINI-POSTER.
text: The faded, mid-'’80s poster features Randy, biceps bulging,
text: crushing a head of broccoli between his fists. Across the
text: top, it says “EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, PUNK!"
speaker_heading: FAN #2
dialog: (as Randy signs)
dialog: My first match ever was you versus
text: Davey Diamond at the Spectrum.
dialog: (nostalgic)
dialog: 1985...
text: Randy smiles a little. He remembers, too. He hands back the
text: poster. Fan #2 looks fondly at Randy, a part of his boyhood.
speaker_heading: FAN #2 (CONT'D)
dialog: (vaguely sad)
dialog: You were awesome.
text: Randy nods, a bit uncomfortably. The two fans, muttering
text: thanks, drift off into the Delaware night. Randy is left
text: standing alone, still holding Fan #1'’s pen.
text: He walks over to a beat-up old CONVERSION VAN and climbs in.
text: Turns on the engine. Music starts up on the stereo mid-song.
scene_heading: MUSIC: CINDERELLA - “DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU GOT (TIL IT’S GONE)”
scene_heading: INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE OAKS - RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Randy parks in front of his TRAILER. He gets out and heads
text: toward it. A dismayed look comes over his face.
text: RANDY'S POV: The door is PADLOCKED.
text: He tugs on the lock. Tugs on the door. No dice.
text: He violently kicks the padlock in a moment of rage.
scene_heading: EXT. RANDY’S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Randy resignedly climbs into the BACK OF HIS VAN.
scene_heading: INT. BACK OF VAN - LATER
text: Randy lies on a scrunched-up mattress on the floor, unable to
dialog: sleep.
text: The van wall is decorated with a MINI-SHRINE Randy has built
text: to himself. Old magazine and newspaper clippings, mini-
text: posters, etc. A few changes of clothes lie in a messy heap in
dialog: the corner.
text: He grabs a bottle of pills and pops a few, washing them down
text: with a beer. He closes his eyes, trying to unwind.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BACK OF VAN - NEXT MORNING

text: Randy glares at Len, the trailer park’s MANAGER.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: C'mon, Len. Don’t be such a fuckin’
text: ballbreaker.
speaker_heading: LEN THE MANAGER
dialog: You'll get in when I get my rent.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You know I’m good for it.
speaker_heading: LEN THE MANAGER
dialog: Sure. You’re good for it every time
dialog: this happens.
text: Randy sigh-groans in frustration.
speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: LEN THE MANAGER
dialog: Twenty bucks.
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE OAKS - IN BACK - EVENING
text: Randy sits on a MILK CRATE by his parked van. On the ground
text: in front of him is a BLENDER connected to an extension cord
text: stretching to another TRAILER. He pours a protein-shake
text: packet into the blender.
text: The trailer door opens. A WOMAN comes out. Lighting a
text: cigarette, she looks up at the cloudless, starry sky.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Thanks, Meg.
text: She gives Randy a small “You got it” wave.

scene_heading: INT. WAYNE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Sitting behind a desk is store manager WAYNE (40). He looks
text: up at Randy, irked.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Do we not know how to knock?
text: Wayne casually clicks a porn site closed on his computer.
speaker_heading: WAYNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's try that again.
text: Randy steps out and closes the door behind him. He knocks.
speaker_heading: WAYNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come in!
text: Randy enters.
speaker_heading: WAYNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, hi, Randy! What can I do for
dialog: you?
text: Randy groans privately. He really hates Wayne.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Do you have any extra shifts you
dialog: could throw my way?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What’s the matter, they raise the
dialog: price of tights?
text: Randy is not amused. Wayne grabs a LOOSELEAF BINDER.
speaker_heading: WAYNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s see what we got.
text: Wayne starts flipping through.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Pretty much anything weekday...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: ANGLE ON bottle: The label says SUSTANON 250. The rest of the
speaker_heading: label is in SPANISH.
speaker_heading: GREGG
dialog: I’m tellin’ ya, bro, it’s identical
dialog: to the German.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I tried Mexican sus once. Gave me

speaker_heading: GREGG

speaker_heading: KOREAN LADY
dialog: Okay, okay, no problem.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VAN - DAY
scene_heading: MUSIC: GREAT WHITE - “ONCE BITTEN TWICE SHY”
text: Randy is driving along Route 21. “Once Bitten Twice Shy” is
text: blasting on the stereo. One hand on the wheel, he bangs out
text: the song’s piano riff on the dash with the other.
text: He passes Cheetah’s, a STRIP CLUB. He keeps an eye on it as
text: he drives past.
text: The song fades out. He pops the tape out of the deck and
text: tosses it on the passenger seat. On it is a messy pile of old
text: cassettes. Skid Row. Métley Criie. AC/DC. Guns ‘N’ Roses. He
text: sifts through the selection, one eye on the road.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
scene_heading: MUSIC: AC/DC - “BACK IN BLACK”

text: Volpe walks off.
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA —- SHORT TIME LATER
text: Randy sits alone a table toward the back. He takes a roll of
text: athletic tape out of his supplies-filled WHEELIE TRAVEL BAG.
text: He starts WRAPPING HIS KNEES AND ANKLES. He does it ina

scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA —- SHORT TIME LATER
text: Randy is hashing out the match with his opponent, a wiry
text: Puerto Rican kid whose shiny vinyl pants identify him as KID
speaker_heading: LOCO (22).
speaker_heading: RANDY

text: Kid Loco nods, listening closely, deferential to the legend.

speaker_heading: LEX LETHAL

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER
text: Randy emerges from the cafeteria. A look of PLEASED SURPRISE
text: comes over his face.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What’s up, kiddo?
text: RANDY'S POV: Standing there in an otherwise empty hallway is
text: a plain-ish YOUNG WOMAN (22). She looks at him with an
text: unsmiling expression. This is STEPHANIE.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Long time no see.
text: Randy pulls her in for a hug. She doesn’t really hug back.
text: She steps back, breaking off the hug. A brief, awkward pause.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Whatcha doing here? Here to root on
dialog: your old man?
text: She shakes her head no.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s okay—as long as you’re not
dialog: rooting against me!
text: She is irked by his jokiness.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Is there someplace we can talk?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I’m on in a sec.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: It won’t take much of your time.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What’s up?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: I’m here because...
text: Stephanie gathers herself. This isn’t easy for her.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I came to make amends.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Amends?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: I’m supposed to talk to people I’ve
dialog: hurt.
text: Randy is puzzled for a moment. Then, it clicks in.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Ohh... 12-stepper.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: (nods )
dialog: AA.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Good for you. That’s great.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Thank you. I’m sure you mean that.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I do.
text: She smile-nods insincerely.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT’D)
dialog: So's that it?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: I need to apologize.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: For anything I’ve done or said over
dialog: the years. All the anger at you.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Okay...
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Like the last time I saw you... I’m
dialog: sorry for what I said.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (dismissive wave)
dialog: Don’t worry about it.
text: Stephanie is irked by his lack of engagement. She looks at
text: him with suspicion.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Do you even know what I said?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: What did I say?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: It was about your mom. And me.

text: MEATHEAD #1 gives Randy an excited high-five.
speaker_heading: MEATHEAD #2
dialog: We gonna see some action tonight?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (sly grin)
dialog: Tonight’s forecast calls for severe
dialog: butt-whoopin’s with a 100 percent
dialog: chance of pain.
text: Psyched “Yeah!”"s from the meatheads. Stephanie is pissed at
text: the interruption. And, even more, Randy’s embrace of it.
speaker_heading: MEATHEAD #1
dialog: Could we get a picture?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: No problemo.
text: The two meatheads flank Randy, their arms around his broad
text: shoulders. Meathead #1 looks tentatively at Stephanie,
text: holding up his DIGITAL CAMERA.
speaker_heading: MEATHEAD #1
dialog: Think you could...?
text: She coldly takes it.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: No problemo.
text: She looks into the camera. The meatheads stick their tongues
text: out and throw up devil signs. Randy flexes theatrically,
text: making his best “Aaargh!” wrestling face.
text: Stephanie snaps a shot. Meathead #1 takes back his camera. He
text: and his buddy pat Randy heartily on the back.
speaker_heading: MEATHEAD #1
dialog: Thanks a lot, yo. Kick some ass out
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You know it, broski!
text: The meatheads excitedly head off.

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT’D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Same shit.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: They’re fans.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I hafta. It’s work.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: I’m in the middle of saying
dialog: something important and you drop it
dialog: for the fucking wrestling.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I didn’t ask them to come over.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: It’s like I’m 10 all over again.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Are we almost done with this?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: This what?
speaker_heading: RANDY

text: Kid Loco falls to the canvas.
text: Randy struts around the ring, exhorting the crowd, soaking up
text: their cheers.
text: Distracted, Randy doesn’t notice Kid Loco peeling himself off
text: the mat. Kid Loco sneaks up behind Randy and SMASHES HIM IN
text: THE HEAD. Randy goes down.
text: Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They’re both on their knees, chest-
text: to-chest. Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him.
text: Kid Loco tightens around Randy’s arms, arches his back,
text: presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a
text: LATERAL DROP. Randy’s head hits the canvas hard as he slams
text: down on his back.
text: As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS FOR THE
scene_heading: TURNBUCKLE.
text: RANDY'S POV: Kid Loco is untying the turnbuckle’s padded
dialog: cover.
text: Randy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the
text: waistband of his tights and pulls out a RAZOR BLADE. He tucks
text: the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm.
dialog: 16.
text: Kid Loco heads back to Randy. He picks up him by the hair and
text: drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him HEAD-FIRST into the
text: exposed metal post beneath.
text: Randy, clutching his smashed head, discretely runs the blade
text: along his hairline. No one sees it happen.
text: BLOOD STREAMS DOWN Randy’s forehead. The crowd’s ELECTRIFIED.
text: Kid Loco slams Randy’s head into the metal post again. Again.
text: Randy slumps over the corner ropes. Kid Loco cockily struts
text: around the ring.
speaker_heading: KID LOCO
dialog: Look at this loser! How pathetic.
text: ANGLE ON Randy. The taunting stirs something in him. A look
text: comes over him, like he’s Bruce Banner about to become the
dialog: Hulk.
text: Kid Loco saunters back over to Randy. He grabs his head for
text: another post smash, but HE CAN’T. Randy’s neck and arm
text: muscles bulge. His neck veins pop like he’s suddenly super-
dialog: charged.
text: A look of FEAR comes over Kid Loco. He knows the tide is
text: about to turn.
text: Randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs Kid Loco by the
text: hair. He pulls him in close.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (under breath)
dialog: Let’s go home.
text: Randy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage
text: he needs for a throw. Kid Loco shakes his head, begging no.
text: Randy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks
text: down on Kid Loco’s head. Kid Loco’s feet fly off the canvas
text: as his head gets BURIED INTO THE MAT. He gets stuck UPSIDE
text: DOWN with his feet over the ropes.
text: Randy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his
text: knee into Kid Loco’s stomach. Again. Again.
text: Kid Loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes.
text: He scurries away. Randy goes after him.
text: Randy hits Kid Loco with everything he’s got. Dropkicks.
text: Elbows. Bodyslams. He pours it on, unstoppable.
text: Randy drags Kid Loco into the middle of the ring. He looks
text: out at the crowd.
dialog: 17.
text: RANDY'S POV: A trio of fans are chanting.
speaker_heading: TRIO
dialog: Ram Jam! Ram Jam! Ram Jam!...
text: Randy cups his hand to his ear. The chant quickly spreads.
speaker_heading: WHOLE CROWD (0.S.)
dialog: RAM JAM! RAM JAM! RAM JAM!...
text: Randy “mulls” it over. He looks at his laid-out foe. He looks
text: at the corner. He heads for the corner.
text: Randy climbs to the top rope. He looks around at the crowd
text: like he’s still undecided.
text: RANDY'S POV: The fans are cheering, wild with anticipation.
text: Randy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his
text: head like ram’s horns. (Just like in the photo in the opening
dialog: montage. )
dialog: He LEAPS.
text: The leap is not terribly high or graceful. He crashes down
text: onto Kid Loco horns-first. Kid Loco’s whole body convulses.
dialog: The fans lose it. This is what they wanted. The Ram Jam. The
dialog: money shot.

scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

speaker_heading: ON STAGE:
text: A YOUNG STRIPPER (22) works the pole, grinding lewdly to
text: “Stuntin’ Like My Daddy”, a bass-heavy Dirty South rap song.
speaker_heading: RANDY:

dialog: Apologize to this lady.
text: Everyone is taken aback, including Cassidy.
speaker_heading: DUDE #3
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: CASSIDY

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: No, it’s not okay. This is
dialog: definitely not okay.

speaker_heading: DUDE #4
dialog: (to Dude #1)
dialog: You hear what he just called Gina?!
speaker_heading: DUDE #1
dialog: That's my fuckin’ sister!
text: Dude #1 steps to Randy, chest puffed out. Randy whips around
text: and GRABS THE CHAIR OUT FROM UNDER THE BACHELOR. He wields it
text: menacingly at Dude #1, who backpedals, terrified.
text: Randy makes like he’s going to hit the guy with the chair.
text: Instead, he FLINGS IT AT THE WALL.
speaker_heading: DUDE #2 DUDE #1
dialog: Jesus!! What the FUCK!!
text: The entire bachelor party rushes for the curtain. Just like
dialog: that, they’re GONE.
text: Randy looks at Cassidy, expecting a hearty thank you. Instead

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Thanks a lot. That was 200 bucks
dialog: just walked out.
text: Randy is totally taken aback.
speaker_heading: RANDY

dialog: matches in history. 20,000 people.
dialog: Another million and a half watching

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: We were going back and forth, just
text: killin’ each other for a half hour.
dialog: Any wrestling fan, they know all

dialog: Million and a half? Shit.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Yeah, it was big. So a rematch...

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddamn you are smokin’.

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Who knows. I put on a good show...
text: Cassidy nods supportively, sincerely.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Could be the thing that gets me

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You never know who’s in that crowd.

speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus.
text: Randy follows her eyes to his HAIRLINE.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: You're bleeding.
text: A small amount of BLOOD is trickling down from his stitches.
text: He grabs a COCKTAIL NAPKIN and casually dabs it.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Got cut tonight.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Ah, it’s nothing.

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: CASSIDY

text: A TEENAGER in the crowd holds up a sign reading HELLBILLY
text: CANNIBAL SUCKS A FAT DICK.
text: Hellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a
text: folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where

text: Cannibal’s chair is his canvas sack. Under Randy’s is his
text: Dollar Tree plastic shopping bag.
text: Hellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly
text: Cannibal. They take turns punching each other, each shot a
text: little harder than the last. It’s like a violent game of
text: “slaps”.
text: After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his
text: sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in
text: Randy's face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around
text: the ring clutching his face, howling in agony.
text: Hellbilly Cannibal smashes the blinded Randy over the head
text: with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. Hellbilly Cannibal
text: reaches into his sack and pulls out a FLUORESCENT LIGHT TUBE.
text: Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS RANDY in the face. The tube
text: explodes with a pop.
text: Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward
text: Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie
text: board. Just as he’s about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS
text: OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal’s spine gets a violent
text: jolt as the chair hits the mat.
text: Randy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out an
text: aluminum COOKIE TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal in the
text: face with it. The tray makes an awesomely loud METALLIC
text: CLANG. Randy hits him a bunch more times.

text: Randy is starting to get winded. His heart beats faster.
text: He picks up Hellbilly Cannibal and flings him toward the

text: awaiting forearm. He bounces off the opposite ropes and
text: crashes into Randy knee-first.
text: Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his
text: face into the corner post. He scoops him up and FLIPS HIM
text: OVER THE TOP ROPE, out of the ring. Randy LANDS HARD on the

text: over the barricade, into the crowd. Fans scatter in an
text: exhilarated panic.
text: Hellbilly Cannibal throws Randy into a row of empty chairs.
text: Randy goes sprawling. Chairs fly everywhere.
text: Randy gets up. His heart is beating LOUD. FAST.
text: Randy, dazed, heads toward the SNACK-BAR AREA. Hellbilly
text: Cannibal follows after him. Randy grabs a metal GARBAGE CAN
text: and WHIPS AROUND WITH IT, smacking Hellbilly Cannibal square
text: in the face. Hellbilly Cannibal goes down.
text: Randy shakes out the can’s contents over Hellbilly Cannibal,
text: showering him in trash. He shoves Hellbilly Cannibal’s head
text: into the can and falls on it, ass-first.
text: Randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. He
text: POUNDS THE GARBAGE CAN with it, making an UNHOLY RACKET.
text: With the can still over his head, Hellbilly Cannibal rises to
text: his feet. He HEADBUTTS RANDY with the can. Randy, stumbling
text: around, gets headbutted again. Hellbilly Cannibal throws off
text: the can and drags Randy back to the ring by his hair,
text: carrying the ladder in his other hand.
text: Plopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up
text: the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and
text: grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He
text: reaches into Randy’s Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF
text: THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table.
text: Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and pulls him up the ladder
text: with him. They stand at the top, perched high above the
text: table. Just as Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy
text: surprises him with a VICIOUS HEAD-BUTT. Hellbilly Cannibal is
text: caught totally off guard. Randy headbutts him again. Randy
text: grabs Hellbilly Cannibal and PUSHES OFF.
dialog: 32.
text: In mid-air, Randy does a 180 twist, causing Hellbilly
text: Cannibal to CRASH THROUGH THE TABLE with Randy on top of him.
text: Hellbilly Cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back
text: bloodied and covered with tacks. He staggers to his feet.
text: Randy hits him with a dropkick.
text: Randy’s heartbeat is DEAFENING. All other sounds drop out.
text: Randy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up
text: for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A look comes over his
text: face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on the mat.
text: Randy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching
text: his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking at
dialog: the air.
text: RANDY'S POV: The fans are unaware anything is wrong. They
dialog: assume it’s part of the act.
text: Hellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy’s eyes. He
text: knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd.
scene_heading: HELLBILLY CANNIBAL
dialog: Is there a doctor?
text: Few fans look around. Most of them still think this is a gag.
text: Among those who sense it’s real is JERRY DIFUSCO, the event’s

speaker_heading: JERRY DIFUSCO (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LEX LETHAL
dialog: Put him down.
text: They lower him to the mat. Lex hops out of the ring and grabs
text: Randy’s ankles.
dialog: 33.
text: Several of the other guys hop out of the ring, supporting
text: Randy’s underside as they carefully, awkwardly pull him out.
text: By now, the crowd realizes this is real. They surge forward

speaker_heading: JERRY DIFUSCO

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: So, like, wrestling...
scene_heading: DR. TARACHANDANI
dialog: Not a good idea.
speaker_heading: RANDY

text: on the screen:
scene_heading: 1 PLAYER <PLEASE SELECT> 2 PLAYER

scene_heading: INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Randy, standing in the middle of the trailer, does a JUMPING

text: He starts to CRY.
text: Angry, bitter, frightened tears roll down his cheeks.
scene_heading: INT. CHEETAH’S - NIGHT
text: Randy enters the club. It’s crowded tonight. He looks around

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Hey, sweetie. You’re back soon.

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I had a heart attack.

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Where are you parked?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: In back.
text: Another pause of hesitation from Cassidy. This is big.

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: That’s okay.

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Feelin’ much better.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Good, good. What happened?
speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Oh, man. That’s terrible.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Yeah, it was pretty fucked up.

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)

dialog: with the fans.
dialog: (amused grin)
dialog: Promoter told me everybody was

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: That’s funny.

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Doctor says I can’t wrestle no
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Damn. What are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I don’t know. I don’t know what to
dialog: do. If I can’t wrestle...
text: He loses himself in some bleak thought.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: It just happened. You don’t have to
dialog: figure everything out this second.
dialog: Give yourself some time.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Time’s all I got. I just sit there

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You really shouldn’t be alone right

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: That’s why I came to see you.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: (a little unnerved)
dialog: Randy...
text: She looks at him with sympathy.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: I feel bad what happened. But you
dialog: and me... I can’t go there.
text: Randy gives her a sour, disappointed look.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)

dialog: she?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: We don’t really get along too good.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: It doesn’t matter. You need her.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (bitter chuckle)
dialog: She don’t need me.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Everybody needs a father. Trust me.

speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m sorry. I gotta get back in.
text: She puts a sympathetic hand on his knee.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: You take care of yourself.
text: She gives him a peck on the cheek. He lingers there for a
text: second. A weird, tentative moment.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: You gonna be okay?
text: He nods, putting his brave face back on.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I’m Randy The Ram. I’ve taken
dialog: bigger bumps than this.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I’m sure.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Maybe I’1l give my daughter a call.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You should.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Why the fuck not? I’m her father. A

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Unless you’re adopted.
dialog: 46.
text: Cassidy laughs. She gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You're gonna be just fine.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Definitely.

text: His cheery expression fades. He is alone again.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RANDY’S TRAILER - DAY
text: Randy sits on his bed, sifting through a messy, junk-filled
text: shoebox. He pulls out an OLD PHOTO.
text: RANDY'S POV: It’s a mid-’80s photo of Randy and his infant
text: daughter Stephanie in front of the family Christmas tree.
text: Randy, wearing a Santa cap, is smiling and laughing,
text: Stephanie perched on his huge, steroid-pumped bicep.
dialog: 47.
text: He flips the photo over. On the back are a bunch of scribbled
text: PHONE NUMBERS. They’re all crossed-out except the last one.
text: The numbers get progressively more faded from bottom to top,
text: as if they’ve been written down over the course of years.
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Randy stands at a PAY PHONE with the photo, ringing phone
text: cradled to his ear.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE’S VOICE

dialog: do.
speaker_heading: (answering machine BEEP)
text: Randy listens to the silence. He hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - LATER
text: Randy sits in his van by the curb of a modest, lower-middle-
text: class house. He looks at the house, working up the nerve to
dialog: approach.
scene_heading: EXT. STEPHANIE’S HOUSE - LATER
text: Randy stands at the doorstep of the house. Steeling himself,
text: he rings the bell. A WOMAN (22) appears at the door in a T-
text: SHIRT and PANTIES.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (a little thrown)
dialog: Hey... Is Stephanie home?
text: The woman looks at Randy a little coldly, sensing who he is.
speaker_heading: THE WOMAN
dialog: Who can I say it is?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Her father.
text: She disappears into the house.
text: A few moments later, Stephanie emerges with a BACKPACK slung

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where you going?
text: He goes after her.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Can we talk?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE

scene_heading: DEVELOPMENT.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're walking pretty fast there.
dialog: You running late?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: I could help you with that.
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Give you a ride.
text: She keeps right on walking.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: New Jersey Transit sucks!
dialog: And walking.
speaker_heading: RANDY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: The buses smell like piss!
text: She fights off an amused smile. She slows a tiny bit.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Randy is driving Stephanie.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
text: Left at the second stop sign.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Yes, ma’am!
text: Randy drives. He slows at the second stop sign, which is at a
text: bigger, FOUR-LANE STREET. He makes the left. They drive for a
text: stretch in awkward silence. Randy seems a little nervous.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: You gonna talk?
text: A pause as Randy gathers his words.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: There’s something I wanted to tell
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I had a heart attack.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Last week.
dialog: 50.
text: He looks at her earnestly.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I wanna try to fix things.
text: Stephanie sits there in calm silence, processing all of this.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: You are such an asshole.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Now you wanna fix things. Now that
dialog: suddenly you’re all scared and
dialog: alone from your heart attack.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What? No. It’s not like—
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: This is so fuckin’ you. You only
dialog: come around when you need something
dialog: from somebody, when they can do
dialog: something for you. Selfish fuck.
dialog: Good. Be alone.
text: She suddenly OPENS HER DOOR as the van is moving. She HOPS
text: OUT. Randy hits the brakes, alarmed.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Stephanie stumbles and falls. She gets up. Walks off in the
dialog: direction they came from.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Stephanie!

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - NIGHT

text: RAHWAY AUTOGRAF SHOW.
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: INT. RAHWAY RECREATION CENTER - GYMNASIUM - MORNING
text: Randy, standing at a folding table in a gym, unzips a duffel
text: bag. He pulls out a stack of 8x10 GLOSSIES of himself. It’s a

dialog: ‘80s glory.
text: He puts them on the table. Looks around the gym.
text: RANDY'S POV: He’s at an AUTOGRAPH SHOW that hasn’t started
text: yet. Around the perimeter of the gym, TEN FOLDING TABLES are
text: set up. At each one, a BEAT-UP, WORN-OUT OLD WRESTLER is
text: laying out his wares—8x1l0s, old match tapes, etc.
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG (0.S.)
dialog: Didn't think I’d see you here.

text: beginning. He’s wearing the same “BRUMBERG - 44” Mets jersey.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG
dialog: Heard you collapsed at the DiFusco
dialog: show. Sounded pretty scary.
text: Randy smiles coyly.
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT’D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Sold the shit outta that one.
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG
dialog: No way!
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I gotta give credit. DiFusco came
dialog: up with the idea. We’re setting up
text: an angle for a grudge match.
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG
dialog: Wow... Dude, you are good.
text: Randy gives a proud “Hey, what can I say?” shrug.
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT’D)
dialog: I was sure I’d have to cancel the

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What minivan?
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG

text: the floor, etc.) He grabs one and brings it back over.
speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG
dialog: Should get a pretty good crowd
dialog: today.
text: Randy holds up his hand, wiggling his fingers for Brumberg.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I'll start loosening up.
text: Brumberg walks off. Randy looks at the flyer again. A sour

scene_heading: INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
text: The signing is underway. FIVE OR SO FANS mill about the room,

speaker_heading: ON RANDY:

speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: RANDY

scene_heading: INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Randy sits at his table, bored. There are NO TAKERS. He looks

text: RANDY'S POV: One is asleep. Another looks borderline

text: WHEELCHAIR. Attached to his calf is a URINE BAG. A feeble
text: stream of urine trickles into the bag.
dialog: 54.
text: Randy looks down at the stack of Randy The Ram 8x10s on the

speaker_heading: SCOTT BRUMBERG (0.S.)

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Would you like a lapdance, sweetie?
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: That’s okay.
text: Cassidy moves along. She approaches a PAIR OF GUYS. She leans
text: in to one of them.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Would you like a lapdance?
speaker_heading: GuY #1
dialog: Not right now.
text: She looks toward the other guy. Before she can even ask:
speaker_heading: GUY #2
dialog: I’m good.
text: Cassidy heads off, rejected.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: RANDY (0.S.)
dialog: Hey.
text: She turns and sees Randy. She’s happy to see him after the
dialog: string of no’s.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Hey. How ya feeling?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Better. Good.
text: She leads him over to a table. They sit.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: How'd it go with your daughter?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (unconvincing)
dialog: Good. Fine.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Yeah?
text: Randy dodges her eye contact.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Not too good, actually. She tore me
dialog: a new asshole.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Shit. That sucks.
text: He nods dispiritedly.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s tough. You can’t give up. You
dialog: gotta keep trying.
text: Another half-hearted nod. A brief conversational lull.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I was thinking about maybe getting
dialog: her a present.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: That’s a great idea!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What’s she into?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I’m not sure.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: How old is she?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: 22, 23?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: What kind of music does she like?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Is she into books? Cooking?
text: Randy just looks at her blankly.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: How could you not know? She’s your
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I’m a shitty fuckin’ father.
text: Cassidy, feeling bad, is hit with an urge to help.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: She’s 22? Okay...
dialog: (riffing)
dialog: You should get her some clothes,
dialog: some kinda clothes... All girls
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: That could work.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I know the perfect place. This kick-
dialog: ass little vintage shop in
dialog: Westfield.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Saturday's the best time to go.
dialog: That’s when they get the new stuff
dialog: in, all these boxes full of great
dialog: shit.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Okay. Cool.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I'll write it down.
text: Cassidy grabs a pen and a cocktail napkin off the bar.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m pretty sure it’s on 28.
text: She scribbles down YESTERDAZE - WESTFIELD. Hands it to him.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Good tip. Thanks.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You got it.
text: Cassidy starts dancing for him, as is their routine. Randy
dialog: doesn’t seem into it.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I’m gonna grab a drink at the bar.
text: Randy gets up and heads off toward the bar. She watches him
dialog: go, feeling rejected.
text: Cassidy gets up. CAMERA stays on her face as she does a lap
text: around the club. She glances back toward the bar.
text: CASSIDY’S POV: Randy is sitting at bar.
text: She scans the room. A CUSTOMER is looking her way. She starts
text: to approach. Then, she STOPS. She looks back toward Randy
text: again. He’s sitting at the bar alone. She heads over to him.
text: He looks up from his drink.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: That was fast.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Listen...
text: Cassidy pauses, hesitant. She takes the plunge:
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: How ‘bout I meet you there
dialog: Saturday? Help you out.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: (“casual”)
dialog: I’m actually gonna be running
dialog: around right in that area anyway,
dialog: so it’s not really a pain.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: All right. Thanks.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: No problem. You got it.

text: Randy knocks on Wayne’s door.
speaker_heading: WAYNE (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah?
scene_heading: INT. WAYNE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Wayne looks up at Randy, mildly annoyed by the disruption. On
text: his computer screen is an ONLINE POKER game.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Hey, Wayne. Got a sec?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Not really. What?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I was wondering if you had
text: something more steady. Full-time.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Only thing I got right now’s got
dialog: weekends.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: That works.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Isn't that when you sit on other
dialog: dudes’ faces?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Deli counter.
text: Randy seems a little hesitant.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: So, like, working with customers?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
text: All day long, hot horny housewives
dialog: begging for your meat.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And prepared salads.
text: Randy thinks it over.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: That's the only thing you got?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: At the moment. You interested?
scene_heading: EXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Randy stands alone in front of YESTERDAZE, a strip-mall
text: vintage clothing store. He looks at his watch, almost
text: thinking of leaving.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (0.S.)
dialog: Hey.
text: Randy looks up. He seems slightly thrown by what he sees.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Hey.
text: RANDY'S POV: It’s his first time seeing Cassidy in street
text: clothes and in daylight. She’s not wearing makeup, and her
text: hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She’s also a good three
text: inches shorter out of her stripper heels.
text: They shake hands, a bit awkwardly.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I almost didn’t recognize you. You
dialog: look all... clean.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: “Clean”?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Like classy.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Gee, thanks.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Nah, nah, I don’t mean that bad. I
dialog: like it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s like in “Grease”, where she
text: turns into the hot rock ‘n’ roll
text: chick at the end. Except backwards.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Oh-kaay...
text: Randy looks at her sneakers, a far cry from the clear heels
dialog: he’s used to.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy
dialog: or Pam?
text: She gives the question genuine thought.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Pam.
dialog: (playful finger wag)
dialog: But don’t get used to it.
scene_heading: INT. YESTERDAZE - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Randy follows Cassidy toward the back of the store. He looks
text: around, taking in the array of funky ‘50s/'60s/'70s clothes.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: This is awesome...
dialog: (rubs hands together,
dialog: psyched)
dialog: We are gonna find something great!
text: Cassidy is less loose and playful than Randy, much more in
text: business mode. They come to the back where, against the wall,
text: she finds what she’s looking for: a bunch of CARDBOARD BOXES
text: bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops, skirts,
text: pants, etc. She starts sifting through.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Do you know her size?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: She's kinda skinny, a little
dialog: shorter than you.
dialog: 61.
text: Cassidy spots a fun, multi-color MINI-SKIRT. She pulls it
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Could you see her in this?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Maybe.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Not really.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m not sure.
text: Cassidy tosses it back in. She unearths a Flashdance-style
scene_heading: SWEATSHIRT.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: What about this?
text: Randy makes a sour face. She tosses it back.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: So like, what is she? Goth? Punk?
dialog: Hippie?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Preppy? Stoner?
text: Randy ponders the choices.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Not really...
text: Cassidy lets out a good-natured groan of frustration. Randy
text: watches as she continues searching.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Pam?
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Thank you very much.
text: Cassidy looks at him. She can feel his sincere appreciation.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You’re welcome.
text: She returns to searching. Sift, sift, sift, sift.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I think she might be a lesbian.
dialog: 62.
text: Cassidy stops sifting. She looks up at him.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Does that help?
text: Cassidy leads Randy by the arm over to the...
speaker_heading: MEN'S AREA:
text: Cassidy heads to a RACK OF CLOTHES. She quickly zeroes in on
text: a RETRO BOWLING SHIRT. She holds it up to Randy, who makes a
text: scrunched-up face.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Ah, maybe she’s just a friend.
text: Cassidy puts the bowling shirt back. As she does, something
text: catches Randy’s eye.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s that?
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: The green.
text: Cassidy holds up the item for Randy.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: This?
text: An excited look comes over Randy's face.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: It’s perfect.
text: RANDY'S POV: A satin-green ROLLER-DISCO JACKET. Embroidered
text: on the left breast is a big “S” in purple script. It’s UGLY.
text: Cassidy looks at the jacket. She clearly finds it awful.
text: She looks at Randy, who’s beaming with excitement and pride.
text: She finds it very endearing.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I agree.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Yesterdaze bag in hand, Randy opens the door to his van. He
text: and tosses the bag inside. He’s on a post-shop high, mission
dialog: accomplished.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Thanks again.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You found it.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I never woulda known about this
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Okay, I’1l give you that.
text: A tentative pause. Cassidy looks at him, ready to part ways.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: Look, I...
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Man, I worked up a pretty good
dialog: thirst in there. What say we grab a
dialog: beer?
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I gotta get going.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: One beer! We gotta re-hydrate!
text: Cassidy seems torn.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I really can’t.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I got a kid at home.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You have a kid?
dialog: Cassidy nods. Yup.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I had no idea.
text: Cassidy shrugs casually.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Boy or girl?
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Boy. Daniel.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: How old?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Nine.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Wow... I had no friggin’ idea.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: It’s not something I usually tell
text: customers. Not exactly a turn-on.
text: Randy looks off at something by his van. An idea hits him.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Wait.
text: He unlocks the door. Leaning into the van, he TEARS THE RANDY
text: THE RAM ACTION FIGURE OFF THE DASHBOARD. He proudly,
text: excitedly holds it out to Cassidy.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now both our kids got something.
text: She looks at the action figure, reluctant to take it.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're gonna turn this down, too?
dialog: Man, you’re rough!
text: Cassidy chuckles a little. She takes it.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: That's very nice of you. Thank you.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Tell him to take good care of that.
dialog: $300 bucks on eBay.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Nah.
text: Cassidy laughs a little. She can’t help but be charmed by his
text: sweetness and earnestness. After a pause...
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: One beer.
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: INT. LOCAL BAR - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Randy and Cassidy are having beers at the bar. He’s holding
text: her CELLPHONE, looking at PICTURES of her son. He moves on to
dialog: the next one.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: He’s a good-lookin’ kid.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I see where he gets it from.
text: Cassidy smiles, flattered.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: He sure doesn’t get it from his
dialog: douchebag father.
text: Randy skips to the next pic. It’s a shot of an UNDER-
scene_heading: CONSTRUCTION CONDO BUILDING.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Just this condo thing, down by
dialog: Trenton.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You moving there?
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Working on it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s a great area. Way cheaper. And
dialog: the schools are awesome.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What about Cheetah’s?
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I’m done. I’m quitting.
speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)

dialog: give it.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon. Let’s dance.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Right here.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Who cares? Fuckin’ Def Lep!
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: (chuckles )
dialog: I've danced to this plenty.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Fine. Then I’m dancing for you.
text: Randy starts DANCING in front of Cassidy, who’s sitting on a
text: barstool. She smiles.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Is this a lapdance I’m getting?
text: Randy goes into lapdance mode, “seductively” writhing for
text: her, silly and self-aware.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Just sit back and enjoy.
text: He turns around, wiggling his ass a little for her. He runs
text: his hands up and down her sides. He drapes his long blond
text: mane over her shoulders, running it over her face. She
text: laughs, charmed and amused.
text: He gazes into her eyes intensely.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: The lapdancer has become the
text: lapdanced.
text: Cassidy laughs. He continues dancing, totally unembarrassed.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I think we can get you a shift.
text: Randy bobs his head along to the kick-ass Def Leppard tune,
dialog: really loving it.
text: The song builds to its chorus. Randy SINGS ALONG.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Take a bottle, shake it up/ Break
dialog: the bubble, break it u-up...

dialog: I'm hot, sticky sweet/ From my head
dialog: to my feet yeah...
text: From here, the song veers off into a GUITAR PART. Randy nods
text: along, savoring the awesome hair-metal riffing.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: They don’t make ‘em like they used
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Fuckin’ eighties, man. Best shit
dialog: ever.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Def Lep, Gunners...
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: The Criie...
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Then that Cobain pussy had to come

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: No shit...
text: Their EYES MEET. A moment of CHEMISTRY. Mutual attraction.
text: Randy moves closer, his eyes locked on hers. He leans in
dialog: for... a KISS.
text: They MAKE OUT for a few seconds. Cassidy PULLS BACK.
text: She gives Randy a playfully scolding FINGER WAG, masking her
text: fear and discomfort with what just happened.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (CONT’D)
dialog: No contact with the customers.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You're right. My bad.
text: He keeps right on dancing, totally unaware of the shift that

speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What’s up?
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: (glancing at watch)
dialog: I totally didn’t realize the time.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: We just got here.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: I should get home.
text: She stands up. Randy is very disappointed.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: C'mon. You said one beer!
text: Randy points toward her ALMOST-FULL BEER on the bar. She
text: picks it up and CHUGS the whole thing. She slaps the empty

speaker_heading: CASSIDY

text: He walks over to a mirror to see how he looks in his new
text: uniform. He feels a little silly.
speaker_heading: WAYNE (0.S.)
dialog: Here ya go.
text: He turns and sees Wayne, who hands him something. Randy looks

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I thought it was gonna say Randy.
text: ANGLE ON item, a Shop-Rite NAME TAG. The name on it is ROBIN.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Guess they got it off your W-4.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Do I really even need to wear one?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: (sarcastic)

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Yeah, but I—
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Then yes.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Could they maybe re-do it?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Just wear the fucking thing.
text: Wayne walks off. Randy pins the name tag to his apron. He
text: takes another look in the mirror, sighing unhappily.
text: Randy looks up at the employee-room clock. It’s 8:59 AM.
text: He heads toward a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN leading to the deli
text: counter. Standing before the curtain, he pauses a moment,

scene_heading: INT. DELI COUNTER - DAY
text: About 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the deli counter with

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)

text: RANDY'S POV: It says HUDSON ACRES TURKEY BREAST - $5.99/LB.
text: He still has no idea.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd prefer the maple-glazed, but if
dialog: it’s full price...
dialog: 71.
text: Randy briefly catches eyes with another customer, a BIG-
text: HAIRED, SEMI-HOT PARTY CHICK in her forties. The kind of
text: woman Randy would hit on in a bar. He dodges her eye contact,
text: embarrassed by the context.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (to circular lady)
dialog: Hang on, let me...
text: Randy picks up a phone behind the counter.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone, over

dialog: Wayne, please come to the deli
dialog: counter.
text: He cringes a bit as his voice booms over the store speakers.

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)

text: The woman, nodding, looks into the deli case again.
speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Pesto change-o.

text: the container onto the scale. It reads .51 LB.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow. I am good.
text: This gets Randy a small chuckle from the woman. Randy slaps a

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I get you anything else?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Nope. That’s it.
text: He hands her the container.

speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Anytime you wanna join in.
text: Randy scoops up The Ayatollah and drops him over his knee
text: with a BACKBREAKER. The Ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits

text: with a FLYING ELBOW DROP.
text: The Ayatollah gets up, pissed at the rough treatment.
text: Randy goes for a dropkick, but The Ayatollah catches his
text: ankles in midair. He JERKS UPWARD on Randy’s legs, sending

text: Randy off the mat by his neck. Randy THRASHES AROUND,
dialog: fighting for breath.

text: to the ground, gasping for air. The Ayatollah picks up Randy
text: by his hair and flings him back in the ring.
speaker_heading: THE RING:
text: The Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He
text: SMASHES RANDY OVER THE HEAD with it. Randy’s forehead is
