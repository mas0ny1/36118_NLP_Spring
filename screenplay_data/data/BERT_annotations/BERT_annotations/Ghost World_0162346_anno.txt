scene_heading: OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE - EVENING
text: We MOVE through the city in a series of brief shots that
dialog: define and establish our setting, from commercial district
dialog: to residential neighborhood. Eventually we find ourselves
text: moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings. Many
text: of the windows are lit from within by an EERIE BLUE LIGHT.
text: As we track past at window-level we see:
text: A glum, sedated-looking COUPLE watching TV. An ignored TODDLER
text: runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays..
text: An empty room...
text: A large, hirsute MAN, wearing only Lycra jogging shorts,
text: watching the Home Shopping Network while eating mashed
dialog: potatoes with his fingers...
text: A dazed old woman staring out the window.
text: The silhouette of a TEENAGE GIRL dancing by herself.
text: We enter her room and see the TV SCREEN. The source of the
text: THEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production
text: number from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of
text: clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks. We see her silhouetted

scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION - AFTERNOON NEXT DAY.
text: A modern high school auditorium. Over the entrance a banner
text: with a "Coca Cola" logo reads: "GRADUATION TODAY 2 PM."
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - SAME DAY
text: A graduation ceremony is in progress. We DOLLY PAST the bland
text: faces of teary-eyed graduates until we stop on ENID. At first,
text: we only see the top of her mortarboard; as she lifts her
text: head we see that she's trying desperately not to laugh.
text: She makes eye-contact with REBECCA, another graduate, who is
text: also trying to stifle her laughter. The SPEAKER is in an
text: elaborate wheelchair with severe-looking traction devices.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: High school is like the training
text: wheels for the bicycle of real life.
dialog: It is a time for young people to
dialog: explore different fields of interest
dialog: and to hopefully grow from their
dialog: experiences. After all, that which
dialog: we learn from our mistakes can be as
dialog: valuable as what we learn from our
dialog: textbooks, and often we can turn the
dialog: negative experiences that are common
dialog: to all high-schoolers into positive
dialog: steps toward personal growth and
dialog: achievement. In coming to terms with
dialog: my own personal setback, which I'm
dialog: sure you've all heard about, I've
dialog: been able to learn a lot about myself.
dialog: I've learned for one thing that I
dialog: don't need to rely on drugs and
dialog: alcohol
speaker_heading: (APPLAUSE)
dialog: and that I'm very lucky-that more
dialog: people besides Carrie and myself
dialog: weren't hurt in the accident; I've
dialog: learned that I'm blessed with
dialog: wonderful parents, teachers and above
dialog: all the best classmates in the world --
dialog: I love each and every one of you
dialog: guys!!
speaker_heading: (APPLAUSE)
dialog: and I've learned that to get through
dialog: life's obstacles you need faith,
dialog: hope and, most of all, a sense of
dialog: humor.
speaker_heading: (BIG APPLAUSE)
text: A trio of TEENAGE GIRLS (one white, one Asian, one black)
text: come running out from the wings and start dancing and rapping.
text: The audience loves them.

scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The auditorium door opens and GRADUATES emerge. Enid &amp; Rebecca
text: run away from the crowd, triumphantly holding rolled up
text: diplomas. They run toward the school playground, nearly
text: bursting with excitement over their long-awaited release.
text: Enid stops and looks back at the school. She gives it THE
text: FINGER. They sit on a see-saw, out of breath.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: God, what a bunch of retards...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I thought Chipmunk-face was never
dialog: going to shut up.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I know, I liked her better when she
dialog: was an alcoholic crack addict! She
text: gets in one car wreck and all of a
dialog: sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and
dialog: everybody loves her.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It's totally sickening.
text: (she unrolls her
speaker_heading: DIPLOMA)
dialog: Let's see if they gave me the right
dialog: diploma...
text: Enid opens hers. Instead of a diploma, it's an OFFICIAL
text: LOOKING DOCUMENT with a pink Post-It note on the front page.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: These assholes are saying that I
dialog: have to go to Summer school and take
dialog: some stupid art class!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Remember that stupid hippie art
dialog: teacher who failed me sophomore year?
dialog: I didn't think that just because you
dialog: get an "F" that means you have to
dialog: take the class over again.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You loser.
scene_heading: EXT. "DAYS INN" HOTEL - EVENING

scene_heading: INT. "DAYS INN" HOTEL - EVENING
text: Party in progress in the "Gold Room". A band plays TOP-40

speaker_heading: REBECCA

dialog: This is so bad, it's almost good.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: This is so bad it's gone past good
dialog: and back to bad again...
text: CLOSE-UP ON ENID, we see the party from her POV: The six or
text: seven MOST POPULAR STUDENTS huddle closely together.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Just think, we'll never have to see
dialog: any of these creepy faces ever again.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Unless they're in your Summer school
dialog: class!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Uh oh... don't turn around...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Forget it...
text: MELORRA, an ambitious, incessantly upbeat classmate,
text: approaches them.
speaker_heading: MELORRA
dialog: Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe
dialog: we made it!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, we graduated high school --
dialog: how totally amazing.
speaker_heading: MELORRA
dialog: So what are you guys doing this
dialog: Summer?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: MELORRA
dialog: I'm going to be in this actor's
dialog: workshop, and I'm hoping to start
dialog: going on auditions soon. I'm so
dialog: excited to finally have some free
dialog: time. We have to get together this
dialog: summer!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
speaker_heading: MELORRA
dialog: (spotting better people
dialog: to talk to)
dialog: Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
text: Melorra leaves.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Since when is she an "actress"?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I know, she needs to die immediately.
text: TODD, a friendly but slightly below-average-looking guy,
text: approaches from behind.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Hey Rebecca!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh... hi...
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So... we finally --
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What about me? Am I not even here?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Oh, hey Enid...
dialog: (starting over)
dialog: So... we finally made it!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (awkward pause)
dialog: So... where are you going to college?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (before Rebecca can
dialog: answer)
dialog: We're not.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Really? Both of you?... Why not?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Just because.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We have other plans.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I guess I should have figured that
dialog: you two would do something different.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What are you going to be when you
dialog: grow up, Todd?
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Well I'm going to major in Business
dialog: Administration and, I think, minor
dialog: in Communications.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: See, that's exactly the kind of thing
dialog: we're trying to avoid.
dialog: (pause)
text: Todd starts to talk again but Enid has noticed something off
text: to the side.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: So... I --
text: Enid grabs Rebecca and turns her away from Todd before he
text: can finish his sentence.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler
dialog: going out with Rod Harbaugh?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: How perfect.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: He better watch out or he'll get
text: AIDS when he date-rapes her.
text: Todd, forgotten, walks away. The singer wails a sappy, maudlin
text: ballad. Enid spots DENNIS, the class loser, wandering around
dialog: by himself.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: God, just think, we'll never see
dialog: Dennis again.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: God, think about that... that's
dialog: actually totally depressing.
scene_heading: INT. THE QUALITY CAFE - DAY
text: The QUALITY CAFE is Enid and Rebecca' s hangout. A 50-ISH
text: MAN with shaved head, and his VAGUELY DIABOLICAL WIFE sit
text: eating lunch. Enid is drawing a picture of them in her
text: sketchbook when Rebecca arrives.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Look at these people behind you.
dialog: I'm totally convinced they're
dialog: Satanists.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Just look at them!
text: REBECCA turns and makes eye contact with MR. SATANIST. She
text: calmly turns back to face Enid before cracking up.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: So, when are we going to start looking
dialog: for our apartment?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Soon... I have to wait and see how
dialog: this Summer class goes.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Did you sign up yet?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, I just picked the one that
dialog: sounded the easiest.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: God, it's so weird that we're finally
dialog: out of high school... We've been
dialog: waiting for this our whole life! Now
dialog: we can get our own apartment and do
dialog: anything we want. It's such a weird
dialog: feeling.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
text: Enter JOHN ELLIS, an obnoxious young man with a perpetual
dialog: smirk.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca,
dialog: the little Jewish girl and her Aryan
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You're late, asshole.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Fine, and how are you?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Did you bring that tape?
text: He puts a videotape on the table, just out of reach.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You never paid me for that tape with
text: the Indian dance routine.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I did too!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Tsk! You Jews are so clever with
dialog: money...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: We should follow them!
text: As the SATANISTS walk outside, they open umbrellas, even
text: though it's a bright, sunny day.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Totally... Oh my God, look!
text: The girls get up to follow them. Enid grabs the videotape.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (to John)
dialog: Thanks for the tape - I'll have to
dialog: pay you later, I'm broke.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey, where are you going?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Later, "Dude".
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Much later.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: In fact, never.
scene_heading: EXT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY
text: Under harsh, glaring sunshine, the girls follow a half-block
text: behind the SATANISTS.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What do you do if you're a satanist,
dialog: anyway?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You know, sacrifice virgins and
dialog: stuff...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That lets us off the hook.
scene_heading: EXT. ACROSS FROM WOWSVILLE - TEN MINUTES HAVE PASSED
text: The SATANISTS continue slowly along with Enid &amp; Rebecca still
dialog: following.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Maybe there's some weird secret
text: satanic society that meets at the
dialog: Quality Cafe and all of the other
dialog: regular customers are in on it except
dialog: for us.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Or maybe not.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or
dialog: they're planning to brainwash us and --
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Okay, okay!
scene_heading: EXT. WOWSVILLE DINER - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hey, look at this...
text: Enid points at the mini-mall in front of them. A new
text: restaurant - we see their banner: "GRAND OPENING. WOWSVILLE -
scene_heading: THE AUTHENTIC 50'S DINER".
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: "Authentic 50's diner"? Since when
dialog: were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: God, it's so totally pathetic.
scene_heading: INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - DAY
text: They're in a booth looking at menus. It's a less accurate
text: version of "Johnny Rockets". A golden oldie from the 80's
text: plays on the jukebox.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Who can forget this great hit from
dialog: the 50's?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I feel as though I've stepped into a
dialog: time warp!
text: The WAITER approaches. He has an ostentatious 70's-style
dialog: perm.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Check out the awesome "fifties" hairdo
text: on the waiter.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Hi, my name is Allen, and I'll be
dialog: your waiter this afternoon.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hi, Al!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Can we call you "Weird Al"?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Heh heh. Our specials today are pasta
text: Vasilio, which is a pasta salad with
dialog: a light basil vinaigrette--
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That was a popular dish in the 50's,
dialog: huh Weird Al?
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: I imagine so! Also, we have a spinach
text: tortellini in a ricotta sauce. Both
dialog: of those are $6.95... shall I give
dialog: you a few minutes to mull it over?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I just want an order of onion rings.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I might actually get the pasta
dialog: special.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You loser!
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Pasta special and an order of onion
dialog: rings. Very good.
text: Al leaves.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Did you notice all those weird things
dialog: on the menu? Like "The Salad
dialog: Explosion"?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I know... and instead of "dessert"
dialog: it says "Mindbenders."
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What does that even mean?
scene_heading: INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - TEN MINUTES LATER
text: Enid spots an abandoned newspaper, THE FREE WEEKLY, on the
text: adjoining table.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Check out the Personals... maybe our
dialog: future husbands are trying to contact
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: God, this paper is so boring. Who
dialog: reads all this shit?
dialog: (flips through it
dialog: until she gets to
dialog: the Personals)
dialog: Here we go...
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ,
dialog: maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the
dialog: clubs, make each other laugh!"
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You can have that one.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Okay, well here's yours...
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Who said all the most eligible
dialog: bachelors are taken? Not this one!
text: Stunning bod, very snugglelicious
dialog: ocean sunset dreamer."
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Gross.
text: Al returns with their food.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Can I get you ladies anything else,
dialog: or are you all set?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Later I might be interested in one
dialog: of those far-out "mindbenders."
text: Al leaves. Enid goes back to the paper.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you
dialog: remember me? Airport shuttle, June
dialog: 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow
dialog: dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes.
dialog: I was the bookish fellow in the green
dialog: cardigan who helped you find your
dialog: contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we
dialog: have a moment?"
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: God, that's so pathetic. I bet she
text: didn't even notice him.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I know. And he's like psychotically
text: obsessing over every little detail.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We should call him and pretend to be
dialog: the redhead.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh, we totally have to.
text: Enid tears out the ad and puts it in her sketchbook.
text: CU of sketchbook.
scene_heading: INT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: Enid and Rebecca sit with Rebecca's grandmother OOMIE in her
text: living room. They eat TV dinners while watching Oomie's
text: favorite TV SHOW, which we hear but don't see.
speaker_heading: NASAL-VOICED GIRL (V.O.)
dialog: So what happened next, Donna?
speaker_heading: DONNA (DUMB BLONDE'S V.O.)
dialog: Then I told him he'd better take out
dialog: his hose and pump me!
scene_heading: NASAL-VOICED GIRL/ANOTHER GIRL (V.O.)
dialog: Don-na?!
speaker_heading: DONNA (V.O.)
dialog: You guys! My car was out of gas!
text: LAUGH TRACK. Enid leans toward Rebecca.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Does Oomie really like this show?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
speaker_heading: OOMIE
dialog: Girls! Shh!
text: Enid and Rebecca exit.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - EVENING
text: Rebecca looks through Enid's sketchbook while Enid fiddles
text: with the remote, fast-forwarding through a tape in the VCR.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: So what should we do?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Wait... I just want to see what's on
dialog: this tape.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I dunno. John Ellis always puts on
dialog: all this sick stuff that I have to
text: fast-forward past to get to the good
dialog: stuff. There's supposed to be a Don
text: Knotts movie on here someplace.
text: Sound of FAST-FORWARDING. Rebecca glances up from the
dialog: sketchbook.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Wait, what is that?
text: Enid stops fast-forwarding. We don't see the screen but we
text: hear weird sounds like BOOTS WALKING THROUGH DEEP MUD.
speaker_heading: ENID &amp; REBECCA
speaker_heading: EEEEWWWW!
text: Enid lurches forward to avert her gaze. She clicks off the
text: VCR, but leaves the TV on. She notices a PHOTO ALBUM on a
text: bookshelf under the television.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hey - why do you have this?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I've been looking all over for this.
text: ANGLE ON ALBUM as she leafs through it. We see a picture of
text: a FIVE-YEAR-OLD ENID with glasses.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Look at how cute I am!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What a little hosebag.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON PHOTO of ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD ENID &amp; REBECCA at a party.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Look, that's back when I hated you.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I remember every minute of that party.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (another page)
dialog: There's my dad with Joanie.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I can never keep them all straight -
dialog: was she the super-bitch?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: No, she was the second wife. The
dialog: third one was the super-bitch -
dialog: Maxine.
dialog: (finds a picture)
dialog: There! Look at her!
text: ANGLE ON PHOTO of MAXINE.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What a fucking monster!
text: Something on TV catches Rebecca's eye.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh my God! This is that comedian I
dialog: was telling you about! You have to
dialog: see this guy -- he's the absolute
dialog: worst!
text: A dead-pan comedian, JOEY McCOBB, is doing his stand-up
text: routine in a standard brick-wall comedy venue. He has a
dialog: contrived "I'm a weirdo" shtick.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Just because I live with my mother
dialog: people think I'm peculiar... so what
dialog: if she's been dead for fifteen years!
dialog: Hehn hehn...
dialog: (Peter Lorre laugh)
speaker_heading: REBECCA (V.O.)
dialog: God, that's barely even a joke.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: As I always say, take my life...
dialog: please!
speaker_heading: ENID (V.O.)
dialog: If he's supposed to be so weird, how
dialog: come he's wearing Nikes?
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Joey McCobb, ladies and gentlemen...
dialog: Joey McCobb!
speaker_heading: (APPLAUSE)
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Joey McCobb is our God.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I want to do him!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I bet! Actually he reminds me of
dialog: that one creep you went out with --
dialog: you always go for guys with some
text: lame, fake shtick.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What are you talking about -- who?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That Larry guy -- what look was he
dialog: going for? A gay tennis player from
dialog: the forties?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Rebecca turns the page of Enid's sketchbook to the torn-out
dialog: personal ad.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Which loser?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You know, the green cardigan guy.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: Rebecca goes to the phone and offers the receiver.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You call.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Why do I always have to do it?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You're better at it.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (as she dials)
dialog: I remember when I first started
dialog: reading these I thought DWF stood
dialog: for "dwarf!"
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (ear up to phone)
dialog: What does it stand for?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Shh, it's his answering machine...
dialog: (pause)
text: We hear the indistinct traces of a
text: musical message followed by a faint
speaker_heading: BEEP.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hi, it's me - your "striking blonde."
dialog: Of course I remember you. Let's get
dialog: together for lunch sometime... How
dialog: about Friday at one o'clock?... Why
dialog: don't you meet me at my favorite
dialog: restaurant, "Wowsville"... It's in
dialog: the mall on Century Parkway... I'll
dialog: see you there, darling... and be
dialog: sure to wear that sexy green
dialog: cardigan...
text: As Enid hangs up they both start laughing.

text: A franchise convenience store with a western motif.
scene_heading: INT. SIDEWINDER - DAY
text: JOSH, 19, is taking his apron off as his BOSS, a humorless

speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: AH AH AH! What you think you doing?
dialog: You still got five minutes left on
dialog: you shift!
text: Enid (wearing wraparound shades) &amp; Rebecca enter.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Well hello there, young employee of

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Look, I already told you I'm not
dialog: going to give you a ride.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What can you tell me, young man,
dialog: about the various flavors of "frozen
dialog: yogurt"?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Look, I'll be done in a minute.
dialog: Just wait outside.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm afraid I don't understand. I

speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: JOSH! WHAT YOU DOING!?
speaker_heading: JOSH
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: The flavors we're featuring this
dialog: week, in addition to old favorites
dialog: chocolate and vanilla, are Six-Gun
dialog: Strawberry, Wild Cherry Round-up,
dialog: and Ten Gallon Tangerine.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I don't believe I care for any of

text: Rebecca giggles. A customer, DOUG, enters: a lowly specimen

text: filthy designer jeans and no shirt.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, Josh... I need two packs of
dialog: smokes. I'm on a double shift
dialog: tonight... fuckin' sixteen hours,
dialog: man.
text: Doug brings a 40-ouncer to the counter. Josh has two packs

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, and gimme six of these beef
dialog: jerkys too - I'm hungry enough to
dialog: chew the crotch out of a rag doll!

speaker_heading: BOSS

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: So Josh...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm
dialog: almost done.
text: Enid looks at herself in the security mirror. She takes off

text: and replaces them with her standard horn-rims.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (nudging Enid, points
dialog: outside)
dialog: Look at this!
text: Outside we see Doug practicing with nunchuks and drinking a
text: beer. Heavy metal music blares from his car radio. The BOSS
text: sees this and goes out to yell at him.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: You get out of here!

dialog: That guy rules!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Who, Doug? He spends more time here
dialog: than I do...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: So Josh, will you give us a ride?
dialog: Please? Pretty please? It's going to
dialog: be super fun!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Please Josh?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Forget it, there's no way... find
text: some other poor sucker to abuse.
scene_heading: EXT. JOSH'S CAR - DAY
text: Josh is driving, chauffeur-like, with the two girls relaxing
text: in the back seat.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why do you even need a ride? You
dialog: could walk there in two minutes.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It's just an excuse for us to spend
dialog: time with you.
text: Enid and Rebecca giggle.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: So Josh, if this guy freaks out,
dialog: will you protect us?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He has every reason to freak out --
dialog: this is a totally fucked-up thing to
dialog: do to somebody!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: God, I think Josh is too mature for
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I know, look at the way he drives...
dialog: he's like an old man.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
scene_heading: EXT. GAFFEY STREET - DAY
text: Their car accelerates.
scene_heading: INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - 12:35 PM.
text: The three of them are seated at a corner booth. A song from
text: any decade other than the 50's PLAYS on the jukebox. A
text: BUSINESSMAN enters.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Look, maybe that's him!
speaker_heading: ENID
text: It's still twenty-five minutes early.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Aren't there a million places like
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: This is the ultimate. It's like the
text: Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: So, where's "Weird Al"?
speaker_heading: ENID
text: SHH! He's back there. I can see his
text: hair bobbing up and down.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I want to "make love" to him.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm going to tell him you said that.
text: WEIRD AL approaches with menus.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: So nice to see you again, ladies.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hey, Weird Al, there's something my
dialog: friend wants to tell you --
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: SHUT UP!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: She says she wants to MMPH!
text: Rebecca puts her hand over Enid's mouth.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A PUSH SWEEPER, SWEEPING THE CARPET.
text: ANGLE ON: OLD WOMAN slowly sweeping.
text: WE FOLLOW HER BACK TO: Enid, Rebecca &amp; Josh. They're now
text: eating: ten minutes have passed, it's 12:45.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: So Josh... Becky and I are trying to
dialog: figure out what makes you tick.
dialog: Tell us about your political beliefs.
speaker_heading: REBECCA laughs.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: No, I'm serious. Give us your whole
text: basic philosophy in a nutshell.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh my God, look, that's got to be
dialog: him!
text: A GUY enters.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Is he wearing a green cardigan?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
text: The GUY joins a friend.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking
dialog: me out.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: In answer to your question, I suppose
dialog: I endorse policies that are opposed
dialog: to stupidity and violence and cruelty
dialog: in any form...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I figured something like that...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh my God!
text: They see a somewhat funny-looking guy in his late 30's,
text: wearing a green cardigan, SEYMOUR, enter. Enid and Rebecca
text: hunch down in their seats.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It's obviously him!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I can't believe it!
text: Seymour sits down and looks around. Weird Al brings a menu.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE ON: WEIRD AL bringing his milkshake. Ten more
text: minutes have passed, it's 12:55.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What's going on now? What's he doing?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh my god, he just ordered a giant
dialog: glass of milk!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (bursting her bubble)
text: It's a vanilla milkshake.
text: Fifteen more minutes have passed - it's 1:10 PM. Seymour
text: looks around, still hopeful. His date is now TEN MINUTES
speaker_heading: LATE.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What's he doing now?
speaker_heading: ENID
text: He's still just sitting there. God,
dialog: this is totally unbearable!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I wish I could see him.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Go ahead and look, but don't make it
dialog: too obvious...
text: Rebecca turns around and pretends to look past Seymour.
text: It's now 1:30 PM. His date is 30 MINUTES LATE. Seymour gets
text: up and walks sadly towards the cashier (Weird Al).
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Do you think he knows?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I dunno...
text: They watch him leave. Enid goes up to pay the bill while
text: Josh and Rebecca go outside.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hey Weird Al, did that guy say
dialog: anything to you before he left?
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Not a thing.
text: Enid goes back to the table to leave a tip, two dollars. Al
text: passes behind her.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: (cheerfully
dialog: professional despite
dialog: her abuse)
dialog: Thank you and come again.
text: Enid hesitates, overcome with guilt. She glances back at Al,
text: then digs every penny out of her pocket (about seven dollars
text: in coins and wadded up bills) and adds it to his tip.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
text: The trio drive in silence. Suddenly, an extra-wide pick-up
text: vrooms past Josh, cutting off the driver (SEYMOUR) next to
text: him. SEYMOUR bobs violently as he screams silent obscenities.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Jesus, look at this guy.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh my God, that's HIM!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Totally! Look!
text: ANGLE ON: SEYMOUR really having a fit now. Once it's out of
text: his system, he reverts to an amiable poker-face.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: He's insane!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We should follow him home.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Come on, Josh... don't you want to
dialog: see where he lives?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: But this guy is like a one-of-kind,
dialog: rare butterfly, and we have to follow
dialog: him back to his natural habitat...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You need counseling.
scene_heading: EXT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Several minutes have passed. Seymour parks.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: God, he lives right in our
dialog: neighborhood!
text: Seymour gets out and disappears up the steps of his building.
speaker_heading: ENID
text: He doesn't even look that bummed
dialog: out, really.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I know... wouldn't you be totally
dialog: pissed off?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: This kind of thing must happen to
dialog: him all the time.
scene_heading: INT. EXPERIMENTAL FILM - DAY
text: FULL SCREEN: grainy B&amp;W video footage. The CAMERA travels up
text: a shadowy flight of stairs. We hear FOOTSTEPS, a rhythmic
text: POUNDING, and a deranged CHILDREN'S CHOIR ("LALALALALALA").
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: (cheap echo effect)
dialog: Returning to the house of my
dialog: Fatherfatherfatherfather...
text: The CAMERA reaches the top of the stairs, we see a door that
text: slowly CREAKS open. We move into the room beyond, it's
text: decorated with stuff from the 50's and a giant crucifix. We
text: HEAR a televangelist's sermon. We MOVE CLOSE on a little
text: girl's doll. Very slowly a MAN'S HAND reaches for the doll
text: and drags it into the shadows. The hand throws the now
text: mutilated doll into a toilet; water and blood swirl around.
text: We see grainy footage (shot off of TV) of Christians angrily
text: picketing an abortion clinic. CREDITS come up: THE END. A
scene_heading: FILM BY ROBERTA ALLSWORTH.
scene_heading: INT. ART CLASS - DAY
text: The lights go on, the VIDEO ends and the monitor is shut
dialog: off.
text: There are about a dozen students, mostly pimply 14-year-old
text: boys, a few 14-ish girls, and Enid, dressed in schoolgirl
text: outfit. The teacher, ROBERTA ALLSWORTH, addresses the class.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: That piece is entitled
dialog: "Mirror/Father/Mirror." I like to
dialog: show it to people I'm meeting for
dialog: the first time because it says so
dialog: much about who I am and what it feels
dialog: like to inhabit my specific skin.
dialog: And this is exactly what I'm hoping
dialog: to get from each of you over the
dialog: course of this Summer: a picture of
dialog: your own self-exploration. My own
text: background is in video and performance
dialog: art, but I'm hoping that doesn't
dialog: influence you and that you'll find
dialog: your own ways of externalizing the
dialog: internal. At the end of the Summer,
dialog: this class has been invited, along
dialog: with several others in the area, to
dialog: participate in a show of High-School
dialog: art at the Neighborhood Activity
dialog: Center. The title of the show will
dialog: be "Brotherhood and Community: Art
dialog: as Dialogue." I think the
dialog: "Brotherhood" theme ties in nicely
dialog: with the theme of self-discovery
dialog: that I'd like to emphasize in this
dialog: class. Are there any questions so
dialog: far?
dialog: (she's completely
dialog: lost them)
dialog: Great...
scene_heading: EXT. SEYMOUR'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: Enid and Rebecca stand in front of Seymour's apartment.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: This is way too creepy.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: He won't see us... we'll just stalk
text: him from a distance.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start
dialog: feeling really bad again.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: So what should we do? We can't just
dialog: hide all day waiting for him to come
dialog: out...
scene_heading: EXT. SEYMOUR'S BUILDING - MAILBOX
text: There are three mail slots. Enid pulls the mail out of the
text: first one. We see FLOWER BULB CATALOGUES, and LADIES HOME
speaker_heading: JOURNAL.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: This is girl mail.
text: She grabs the mail out of SLOT NUMBER TWO.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: This is all computer catalogues and
dialog: stuff...
text: Rebecca is looking at the mail from SLOT NUMBER THREE.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...
text: (she flips through
dialog: the mail)
dialog: Oh my God, The National Psoriasis
dialog: Foundation!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Bingo!
text: She shoves back the contents of slot number two and grabs
text: the mail from Rebecca. We hear MALE VOICES around the corner.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Wait! Do you hear that?
text: Enid jams the mail back in the slot in a panic.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Shit!
text: They slowly walk around the bushes toward the voices.
scene_heading: INT. SEYMOUR &amp; JOE'S GARAGE SALE - DAY
text: They see the GARAGE SALE, in progress. They've all spotted
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What should we do? What if he
dialog: recognizes us?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Come on, it's too late now...
text: A middle-aged HOUSEWIFE browses with little enthusiasm as
text: Enid &amp; Rebecca tentatively approach. Enid spots a MONGOOSE
text: VS. COBRA taxidermy piece near Joe...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Ew, look at this...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Gross!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I think it's cute - look at his little
text: weasel teeth.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Ew, it's like some gross rat...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (hardly looking up
dialog: from TV)
dialog: It's a mongoose.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Mm...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A mongoose... they eat snakes... you
dialog: never heard of a mongoose? That's a
text: classic piece of vintage taxidermy.
dialog: Nobody alive today knows how to do
dialog: work like that.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (looking underneath
dialog: it)
dialog: How much is this?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Umm... That's not officially for
dialog: sale... I might have to hang onto
dialog: that for the time being.
text: Joe shuts off the TV. He turns to the girls, not wanting to
dialog: lose the rapport he's established with two potential
dialog: customers.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So, are you looking for anything in
dialog: particular? There's a lot of other
dialog: stuff in storage...
text: He picks up a plastic Casio-type guitar/keyboard (a child's
text: toy) and starts noodling pre-programmed rock licks.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to
dialog: you. Absolutely no practice
dialog: necessary. You shread like a giant.
dialog: Just press a button.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That's okay...
text: She notices several modern jazz LPs on Joe's table.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Do you have any other old records
dialog: besides these?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Seymour does.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Who does?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Him. Seymour. He's the man with the
dialog: records.
text: Enid glances at Rebecca and mouths the implausible name:
text: "Seymour?!" Rebecca snorts, unable to control her laughter,
text: and turns away from the table. Enid keeps her cool...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Do you have any old Indian records?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Indian records?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You know, like weird 1960's Indian
dialog: rock n' roll music.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I don't have anything after about
dialog: 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from
dialog: the twenties in my collection, but
dialog: it's not really for sale. I don't
dialog: really collect "foreign."
text: Enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of 78s.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Those are all 78s... Can you play
dialog: 78s?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I
dialog: can play regular records...
text: He points her to a nearby box of LPs.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: There's some good stuff in here...
dialog: do you like old music?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Sure, I guess.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Well there's a few choice LPs in
dialog: here that re-issue some really great
dialog: old blues stuff.
text: Rebecca tugs on Enid's sleeve. Enid gets free and continues
text: looking through the records. She stops on one with an
dialog: especially wacky cover.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Is this one any good?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Nah, it's not so great. Here's the
dialog: one I'd recommend.
text: He pulls out a bland-looking record: "COLLECTOR'S ITEMS,
text: VOLUME THREE." Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: This track alone by Memphis Minnie
dialog: is worth about $500 if you have the
dialog: original 78. She was one of the
dialog: greatest guitar players that ever
dialog: lived, and a great singer and
dialog: songwriter as well. I know the guy
dialog: who owns the original and lent it
dialog: for use on this reissue.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Wow!
text: Rebecca snorts at Enid's over-exuberance. Enid kicks her.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: How much is it?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
text: A dollar seventy-five.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Okay.
text: She pays him.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: If you don't like it bring it back
dialog: for a refund. We're here every
dialog: Saturday.
text: He puts the record into a bag.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm sure it's fine.
scene_heading: INT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY
text: Enid &amp; Rebecca sit in their usual booth. Rebecca is reading
text: THE FREE WEEKLY.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That was truly pathetic.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I know... I still can't get over
dialog: that his name was "Seymour."
text: Rebecca starts looking through the APARTMENT LISTINGS. She
text: takes a pen out of her purse.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: He was so excited when you bought
dialog: that record -- you're a saint!...
dialog: God, these apartments are super
dialog: expensive...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It was so cute how he had his own
dialog: little bags. I thought I was going
dialog: to start crying!... Do you think
dialog: they're gay?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What about the "striking redhead in
dialog: the yellow dress"?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh yeah...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: He should totally just kill himself...
dialog: Hey, here's one
dialog: (circles it)
dialog: ...Oh wait...
dialog: (crosses it out)
dialog: you have to share it with a non
dialog: smoking feminist and her two cats...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I dunno... I kind of like him...
dialog: He's the exact opposite of everything
dialog: I really hate... In a way he's such
text: a clueless dork that he's almost
dialog: cool...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That guy is many things but he
dialog: definitely isn't "cool"... This one
dialog: would be okay, but there's no
dialog: kitchen...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Not really...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Forget it, I can't explain it...
text: Awkward silence. Melorra enters.
speaker_heading: MELORRA
dialog: Oh my god, what are you guys doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What are you doing here, Melorra?
speaker_heading: MELORRA
dialog: My acting workshop is across the
dialog: street from here. I'm just on my
dialog: break.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Well, we won't keep you.
speaker_heading: MELORRA
dialog: I love this place... it's so - you
dialog: know, "funky."
text: Enid and Rebecca look at each other.
speaker_heading: MELORRA
dialog: What are you guys up to?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We're looking for an apartment.
speaker_heading: MELORRA
dialog: God how cool. Where are you moving?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: We're not sure yet, that's why we're
dialog: looking.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
text: Somewhere downtown.
speaker_heading: MELORRA
dialog: God that's so exciting!
dialog: (looks at clock)
dialog: Oops, I should go. Bye you guys!
dialog: Call me.
text: Melorra leaves quickly.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: "Funky"?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What, is she black now?
text: They watch her cross the street - she's dressed in expensive
text: "casual" clothes with a fancy backpack.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I've been thinking about when we
dialog: look for our apartment how we have
dialog: to try and convince people that we're
dialog: like these totally rich yuppies...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That's who people want to rent to.
dialog: It's a known fact that it's way easier
dialog: to get a job and everything if you're
dialog: rich... All we have to do is buy a
dialog: few semi-expensive outfits and act
dialog: like it's no big deal... it'll be
dialog: fun.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You just want an excuse to dress
dialog: like some stupid fashion model without
dialog: me making fun of you.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Just promise you'll do it.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're
dialog: out of your mind.
scene_heading: INT. ENID'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Loud water running; PUNK ROCK blares from adjoining bedroom
text: as Enid, her head in the sink, sings along, making up her
text: own words. As she straightens INTO FRAME, we see that she's
text: dyed her hair green. She grabs a towel and heads into the
dialog: bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Her DAD enters with a mixing bowl, oblivious to the green
text: hair and loud music.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (over music)
dialog: Have you seen my blue spatula?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Not if I don't find that goddamn
dialog: spatula.
text: Dad leaves. Enid messes up her hair in different ways while
text: singing along to the tape and looking at herself in the
text: mirror. Rebecca opens the door and stands in the doorway.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (disdainful)
dialog: When did you do that?
text: Enid turns around, startled, but instantly regains helps
dialog: composure.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What? How long have you been standing
dialog: there?
scene_heading: EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/NEAR ACME SHOES - DAY
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Did you have to buy new hair dye or
dialog: did you still have some left over
dialog: from eighth grade?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Fuck you, bitch!
text: They walk past a sad-looking ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE, in
text: a distinctive old building, that looks as if it's been there
text: forever. They stop and peer through the window.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: We still have to go in there sometime.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It's always closed...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I bet they have tons of incredible
text: shoes hidden in the back.
text: They continue walking.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hey look, it's the pants.
text: We see a pair of discarded jeans on the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Let's go hassle Josh.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: "Hassle"?
text: They see a MIDDLE-AGED MAN dressed in a shabby threadbare
text: suit and hat sitting at what was once a bus stop. The rusty
text: sign has a red sticker on it that says "No longer in service."
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: There he is...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: As always.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Waiting for the bus that never
dialog: comes...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I wonder if he's just totally insane
text: and he really thinks a bus is coming
dialog: or --
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Why don't you ask him.
text: Enid sits next to THE MAN. Rebecca stands behind the bench,
text: taken aback that Enid is going to end the long standing
dialog: speculation.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hi... what's your name?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (looks at watchless
dialog: wrist, then down the
dialog: street)
dialog: Norman.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: ...are you waiting for a bus?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I hate to tell you this but they
dialog: cancelled this bus line two years
dialog: ago... There are no buses on this
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
scene_heading: EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Enid &amp; Rebecca are on the outside porch/walkway on the second
text: floor of Josh's building. Enid POUNDS on his pasteboard door;
text: the windows RATTLE with each hollow THUD.
speaker_heading: ENID
speaker_heading: JOSH!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: JOSH!
speaker_heading: ENID &amp; REBECCA
speaker_heading: JOSH!
speaker_heading: ENID
text: He's probably in there jerking off.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'll bet he never jerks off...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Should we leave a note?
text: Enid finds a piece of paper - the back of a pizza flyer.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Do you have a pen?
text: She writes, while Rebecca looks over her shoulder. "Dear
dialog: Josh. We came by to fuck you but you didn't answer the door.
dialog: Therefore you are gay. Signed, Tiffany and Amber."
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You're not really going to leave
dialog: that are you?
text: Enid pushes the note over his doorknob.
scene_heading: EXT. ENTERING ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Why are we going here? I hate this
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It'll only take a second.
scene_heading: INT. ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY
text: They enter. We see racks of books-with titles like "Make
text: Explosives At Home." Rebecca walks over to the magazine rack.
speaker_heading: CREEP #1
dialog: -- I'm telling you, you're wrong --
dialog: carpet beetles are the only way to
dialog: get the flesh off a corpse... Boiling
dialog: is strictly for amateurs!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Don't you creeps ever talk about
dialog: anything nice? Don't you ever talk
dialog: about fluffy kittens or the Easter
dialog: Bunny?
speaker_heading: CREEP #1
dialog: Look who's talking - little miss
dialog: badass...
speaker_heading: CREEP #2
dialog: Yeah, nice outfit - who are you
dialog: supposed to be, Cyndi Lauper?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Blow me, doofus!
text: John Ellis emerges from the back and begins to unload a box
text: of books onto the shelves. He stops and looks at Enid.
speaker_heading: JOHN ELLIS
dialog: Didn't they tell you?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Tell me what?
speaker_heading: JOHN ELLIS
dialog: Punk rock is over!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I know it's over, asshole, I --
speaker_heading: JOHN ELLIS
dialog: If you really want to "fuck up the
dialog: system" - you should go to business
dialog: school -- that's what I'm gonna do:
dialog: get a job at some big corporation
dialog: and fuck things up from the inside!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That's not even --
speaker_heading: JOHN ELLIS
dialog: Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
text: She wads up a twenty-dollar bill and throws it at him.
speaker_heading: JOHN ELLIS
dialog: Oh, how "punk."
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That tape sucked, by the way!
speaker_heading: JOHN ELLIS
dialog: I'm so sorry if you were offended!
text: He heads toward the back room with the empty box.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Go die, asshole!
speaker_heading: JOHN ELLIS
dialog: Get a job!
text: He exits. Rebecca walks over to Enid.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What was that all about?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It's not like I'm some modern Punk
dialog: dickhead... It's obviously supposed
dialog: to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess
dialog: Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I didn't get it either.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Everybody's too stupid!
scene_heading: INT. ENID'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - EVENING
text: Enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom.
text: She rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box
text: (black hair dye). She wets her hair, then goes into the
text: bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box. The punk
text: rock song we heard earlier plays. She yanks out the tape and
text: flings it away. She skims through her records and CDs,
text: dismissing them all. She notices Seymour's bag in the corner.
text: She takes out the record and puts it on. The first tune is
text: an upbeat instrumental number. She returns to the bathroom.
text: Several minutes pass. TRACK TWO begins on the LP. She (and
text: we) slowly begin to take notice. It's a strange, haunting
text: old BLUES RECORD. We see that the tune has struck a nerve.
scene_heading: INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The song continues. Enid sits in her bean-bag chair. Her
text: hair is now dyed back to black. As the song ends, she picks
text: up the needle and starts it again.
scene_heading: INT. SEYMOUR &amp; JOE'S GARAGE SALE - DAY
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, it took a while before I got a
dialog: chance to play it, but when I heard
dialog: that song it was like --
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: So you really liked it? Yeah, there's
dialog: some really rare performances. You
dialog: liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, that's good too... the whole
dialog: record was good, but that one song,
dialog: "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly
dialog: just keep playing that one over and
dialog: over... Do you have any other records
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: The Skip James record? Yeah, that's
dialog: a masterpiece. There are no other
dialog: records like that! I actually have
dialog: the original 78 of it in my
dialog: collection. It's one of maybe five
dialog: known copies.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (nearly sincere)
dialog: Wow!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Do you want to see it? I can run
dialog: upstairs and get it...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, sure, I guess...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (to Joe, he always
dialog: says this when he
dialog: leaves his table)
dialog: Watch my stuff.
text: Seymour exits. An uncomfortable pause as Enid stands at the
text: table. She touches the mongoose's tooth.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: You still interested in that?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I thought it wasn't for sale.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it
dialog: go...
speaker_heading: ENID
text: It's kind of falling apart.
text: Seymour returns with the 78, holding it like a precious
dialog: object.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Here it is. It's only about V minus
text: and has an incipient lam crack, but
dialog: plays decent as I recall.
text: Seymour passes the 78 to Enid who follows suit and holds it
text: carefully by the edges.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Wow...
text: Enid pretends to drop the record.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oops! I dropped it!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: NO!!!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hey, I was only kidding!
text: She hands the record back to Seymour, who's shaken and
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Jesus, Seymour... are you all right?
scene_heading: INT. ART CLASS - DAY
text: Starts with a PAN ACROSS a wall of unimpressive high school
text: art: dumb drawings of fighting Chuck Norris-types, traced
text: centerfolds, highly sexualized horses, etc. And, on a table,
text: a wire sculpture made from two coathangers.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm not going to start a discourse
dialog: on the subject of "good" art vs.
dialog: "bad" art; these judgments are for
dialog: each person to make on his own. I
dialog: merely want to help each of you find
dialog: the best way to look within yourselves
dialog: the best key to your particular lock.
dialog: Last week I asked you to-try and
dialog: create a piece of artwork that
dialog: responds to something that you have
dialog: strong feelings about.
text: Enid enters late and puts her sketchbook on the table.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: And it looks like we have some really
dialog: interesting work up here....
text: Roberta peruses some of the art, then points to a very violent
dialog: drawing.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: What can you tell, us about your
dialog: piece... uh...
dialog: (struggles to read
dialog: signature)
dialog: ...Phillip?
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: (very stupid and
dialog: nervous)
dialog: Uh... it's uh... it's about The
dialog: Mutilator...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: My goodness!
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: It's this really great video game
dialog: about a guy who kills people with a
dialog: big hammer...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (trying to make a
dialog: joke)
dialog: I thought maybe this was supposed to
dialog: be your father.
text: No response from Phillip. Roberta nicks up Enid's sketchbook
text: and leafs through it.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: And what can you tell us about this...
dialog: (searches for name)
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Enid. It's sort of like a diary I
dialog: guess.
text: We see several sketches, including the drawing of the
text: SATANISTS. Roberta shows a few pages to the class.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I think that Phillip and Enid can
dialog: help us to see that there are-many
dialog: different ways we can express
dialog: ourselves. We can do things like
dialog: these cartoons that are amusing as a
dialog: sort of light entertainment or we
dialog: can do work that is more serious in
dialog: scope and feeling and that deals
dialog: with issues; emotional, spiritual,
dialog: political; of great importance. I
dialog: hope that you will each have the
dialog: tools to do that type of work by the
dialog: end of this class.
dialog: (pause, points at
speaker_heading: WIRE SCULPTURE)
dialog: Who is responsible for this?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Talk to us about it...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It's my response to the issue of a
dialog: woman's right to choose... it's
dialog: something I feel super-strongly about.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Isn't this a wonderful piece, class?
dialog: This definitely falls into that higher
dialog: category of art I was speaking of
dialog: earlier.
text: MARGARET glances over at Enid. Enid gives her a dirty look.
scene_heading: INT. "MASTERPIECE VIDEO" STORE - AFTERNOON.
text: On a monitor, a generic trailer is playing.
scene_heading: MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1
dialog: Hello and welcome to Masterpiece
dialog: video. How may I help you this
dialog: afternoon, sir?
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: I'm looking for a copy of 8 1/2.
scene_heading: MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1
dialog: Yessir! Is it a new release, sir?
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: No, it's the classic Italian film.
scene_heading: MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1
dialog: Let me look that up on the computer
dialog: for you, sir!
scene_heading: (FIDDLES WITH COMPUTER)
dialog: Yes, here it is - 9 1/2 WEEKS with
dialog: Mickey Rourke. It's in our "Erotic
dialog: Dramas" section.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: No, not "9 1/2", 8 1/2 , the Fellini
dialog: film.
scene_heading: MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #1
dialog: I'll check that for you sir. How do
dialog: you spell the actor's name - F-I-L-E-
scene_heading: E-P-E-E...?
text: WE SEE Enid &amp; Rebecca, dressed up in sexy outfits.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: How about this one?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hey, you have to see my new good
dialog: luck charm.
text: She pulls out a small porcelain figure of a MAN FLUSHING
text: HIMSELF DOWN A TOILET with the words "Goodbye Cruel World"
text: on the base.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Ew ... when did you get that?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: This morning at Seymour's garage
dialog: sale.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: God, aren't you tired of Seymour
dialog: yet?
text: Rebecca picks up another tape.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: How about this?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All
dialog: these movies suck.
text: An obnoxious SIX-YEAR-OLD tries to get his PARENTS to add
text: another tape to their already tall stack. He stares at the
text: video monitor.
text: Another MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE reshelves videos near them.
scene_heading: MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE #2
dialog: (overly cheerful)
dialog: Hello! How are you young ladies this
dialog: evening? May I help you find a
dialog: particular Masterpiece movie?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: No.
text: They walk by him.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Let's get out of here, this place
dialog: makes me sick.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We have to do something fun tonight
dialog: this is my last weekend of freedom
dialog: before I start my stupid job.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I know a party we could go to...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What? Where?!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It's a surprise.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't believe you.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: If I promise you there's really a
dialog: party with a lot of guys, do you
dialog: promise you'll go?
scene_heading: INT. SEYMOUR &amp; JOE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: A depressing COLLECTORS' GET-TOGETHER in progress. Enid &amp;
text: Rebecca sit on an old sofa in the corner. Nine or ten RECORD
text: COLLECTORS mill about.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: There are some records I will pay
dialog: serious money for, provided they're
dialog: a sincere V plus. Other than that
dialog: I'd prefer to just have them on CD.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: CDs will never have the presence of
dialog: an original 78.
speaker_heading: JEROME
text: WRR-ONG! A digital transfer adequately
dialog: mastered will sound identical to the
dialog: original. Do you have a decent
dialog: equalizer?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I have a Klipsch 2B3.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Obviously the problem! You expect a
dialog: ten-band equalizer to impart state
dialog: of-the-art sound? Dream a little
dialog: dream! etc...
text: Enid &amp; Rebecca are sitting nearby.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I totally, totally hate you.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
text: ANGLE ON: Joe stands talking to GERROLD, an obnoxious, pushy,
text: fast-talking guy who keeps eyeing Rebecca. He shovels food
text: into his mouth as he speaks.
speaker_heading: GERROLD
dialog: So what's the story with the two
dialog: cheerleaders over here?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: They're Seymour's.
speaker_heading: GERROLD
dialog: Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't worry about it. He's not gettin'
dialog: any and neither are you.
speaker_heading: GERROLD
dialog: (poking Joe in the
dialog: chest)
dialog: Let me tell ya somethin', Joe...
dialog: Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a
dialog: home run without swinging the bat!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Right.
text: Gerrold walks over to where Rebecca is sitting. He sits on
text: the arm of sofa next to her.
speaker_heading: GERROLD
dialog: Mind if I sit here?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (staring straight
dialog: ahead)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GERROLD
dialog: Whoa, that was cold! Hey, you're
dialog: okay, you're pretty sharp. So uh...
dialog: hey, you're wearing a green dress -
dialog: whadda you Irish? I bet you're Irish.
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Melorra...
speaker_heading: GERROLD
dialog: Melorra, listen to me - let me tell
dialog: you something Melorra... you seem
dialog: like an interesting chick - what are
dialog: you doing hanging out with these
dialog: losers here? Whaddya say you and me
dialog: take off and hit some nightspots
dialog: etc. etc.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get
dialog: a beer.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
speaker_heading: (to ENID)
dialog: Wait...
text: Enid goes over to the beer keg. Nearby Seymour stands talking
text: to PAUL - a humorless, middle-aged guy in a suit and tie
text: who's contemptuously examining one of Seymour's 78s.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: ...but it plays like new. There's no
dialog: groove wear.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh please... It has an enlarged center
text: hole and a hair crack.
text: Enid approaches them.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: But the crack is so tight it's
text: completely inaudible.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: A tight hair crack is just that - a
dialog: crack. I don't collect cracked
dialog: records.
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: I only pay a premium for mint records
dialog: Seymour, you know that! Please!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What was all that stuff about enlarged
dialog: holes and tight cracks?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I... I didn't think you would have
dialog: any interest in this get together...
dialog: I mean if you had told me you were
dialog: coming I would have warned you --
dialog: it's not like a real party or
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You're right about that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So this is your record collection?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Oh God no. This is just junk I have
dialog: for sale or trade. The record room
dialog: is off-limits.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Really? Can I see it?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yeah, well sure... you can if you
dialog: want to... it's just I don't want
dialog: all these guys in there at once...
dialog: you know...
scene_heading: INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Enid &amp; Seymour enter his inner sanctum, beverage containers
text: in hand -- nicely-displayed old collectibles cover just about
text: every inch of wall space.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Wow! This is like my dream room!
dialog: Are these all records!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I have about fifteen hundred 78s at
dialog: this point. I've tried to pare down
dialog: my collection to the essential...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: God, look at this poster! I can't
dialog: believe this room! You're the luckiest
dialog: guy in the world! I'd kill to have
dialog: stuff like this!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Please... go ahead and kill me!
dialog: This stuff doesn't make you happy,
dialog: believe me.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh, come on! What are you talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: You think it's healthy to obsessively
dialog: collect things? You can't connect
dialog: with other people so you fill your
dialog: life with stuff... I'm just like
dialog: all the rest of these pathetic
dialog: collector losers.
text: Enid writes her name in the dust.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: No you're not! You're a cool guy,
dialog: Seymour.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why
dialog: haven't I had a girlfriend in four
dialog: years? I can't even remember the
dialog: last time a girl talked to me.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm talking to you... I'll bet there
dialog: are tons of women who would go out
dialog: with you in a minute!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Oh, right...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: No really... I guarantee I could get
dialog: you a date in like two seconds...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Good luck...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm totally serious!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yeah, well...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I mean it -- You leave everything to
dialog: me -- I'm going to be your own
dialog: personal dating service!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I appreciate the offer but you really
dialog: don't --
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Mark my words, by the end of this
dialog: summer you'll be up to your neck in
dialog: pussy!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid
dialog: but I - I really --
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
text: As Enid and Seymour walk. A 20-ish secretary-type passes.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What about her? Would you go out
dialog: with her?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I don't know, what kind of question
dialog: is that? I mean it's totally
dialog: irrelevant because a girl like that
dialog: would never be caught dead with me...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: But putting that aside for now, would
dialog: you go out with her?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I really didn't get a good look at
dialog: her.
text: A breasty, overweight 40-year-old walks by.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Okay, what about this one? Are you
dialog: into girls with big tits?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect
dialog: data here! Don't you want me to find
dialog: you your perfect dream girl?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I'm just not one of those guys who
dialog: has a "type"...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Every guy has a type!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (he doesn't really
dialog: mean this)
dialog: I mean as long as she's not a complete
dialog: imbecile and she's even remotely
dialog: attractive...
text: They walk by "the pants."
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hey look, there's Norman!
text: He's sitting as before at the defunct bus stop.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hi Norman.
text: Norman nods politely. Seymour looks quizzically at Enid.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET/NEAR SIDEWINDER - DAY
text: They're in another part of town near THE SIDEWINDER.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: We need to narrow this down somehow...
dialog: we need to find a place where you
dialog: can meet women who share your
dialog: interests.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Maybe I don't want to meet someone
dialog: who shares my interests. I hate my
dialog: interests! Where can I go to meet
dialog: the exact opposite of myself?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your
dialog: five main interests, in order of
dialog: importance.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Well, let's see... I guess I'd have
dialog: to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and
text: Ragtime music at the top of the list,
dialog: then probably...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Let's just say "music" - that way
dialog: you only use up one...
dialog: (spots The Sidewinder)
dialog: Wait, we have to go in here for a
dialog: second...
scene_heading: INT. SIDEWINDER - DAY
text: They enter. Josh has his back to the counter as he makes a
text: complicated frozen yogurt sundae for a little girl.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hi Josh.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (without turning around)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I just stopped in to say hi.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah, well... hi...
text: He turns around non-chalantly, holding the sundae. He looks
text: up and sees Enid with the guy from Wowsville (Seymour).
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: This is my friend Seymour.
text: Josh is startled and drops the sundae. The girl starts crying.
text: Josh immediately starts to clean up the mess. Enid, satisfied,
text: heads with Seymour for the door.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: See you later, Josh!
text: As the door closes, we hear a familiar voice.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: JOSH! WHAT YOU DOING!?
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
text: Enid &amp; Seymour continue walking.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So is that your boyfriend?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend...
dialog: He's just this guy that Becky and I
dialog: like to torture.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Well are --
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (interrupts suddenly)
dialog: Oh my god! We have to go in here!
text: They are in front of STAN'S, a porno shop.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yeah, sure... very funny....
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Please, Seymour... Becky and I have
dialog: been dying to go in here but we can't
dialog: get any boys to take us... Please?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I - I'd really rather not...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: We'll just go in for one minute --
dialog: it'll be a riot!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I don't think so...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: PLEASE? We have to!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I really don't think it's a good
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Fine, I'll go by myself then...
scene_heading: INT. ANTHONY'S II - DAY
text: Enid &amp; Seymour enter. There are a half dozen MEN browsing
text: through the videos and magazines.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Wow! Look at all these creeps!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Shh!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: OH MY GOD!
text: Enid runs over and grabs a BLOW-UP SEX DOLL. Everyone in the
text: store looks at them. Seymour blushes and sweats.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What kind of weirdo would actually
dialog: have sex with this? We have to buy
dialog: this!
text: She looks around, over-stimulated.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: God, this place is a total riot!
text: She picks up a magazine.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" -
dialog: isn't child pornography totally
dialog: illegal?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: These are older women just dressed
dialog: up to look young... I think.
text: ANGLE ON a pair of THIGH-HIGH LEATHER FETISH BOOTS.
speaker_heading: ENID (V.O.)
dialog: Oh my god!
text: WIDER ANGLE: She's in another part of the store near the
speaker_heading: CASHIER.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: How much are these boots? Do you
dialog: have these in size five?
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: That's the only pair of those I have
dialog: right now. I'm getting a new order
dialog: in next week...
text: She spots something and gasps. She yells across the store.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: OH MY GOD SEYMOUR! You have to lend
dialog: me the money to buy this.
text: Everyone looks at Seymour as he sheepishly approaches. He
text: takes out his wallet.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Uh, I don't have much money with me
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: C'mon, Seymour, please?
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Why don't you come back in two weeks -
dialog: we'll be having our annual Back-to-
dialog: School sale.
scene_heading: INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Rebecca is at the counter serving a long line of YUPPIES. We
text: can see a sign next to the counter that reads: "Answer today's
dialog: trivia question and get a free small coffee".
speaker_heading: YUPPIE #1
dialog: I'd like a medium latte for here.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Can I get you a biscotti to go with
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: YUPPIE #1
dialog: NO! Just the latte.
text: Enid is next wearing a RUBBER BONDAGE MASK with devil horns.
speaker_heading: ENID (V.O.)
dialog: Give me all your money, bitch!

speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You won't believe it! Guess!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Anthony's II!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No way... when?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Just now... I went with Seymour.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You cunt!
text: FELDMAN is in line behind Enid. He's a poodle-haired, fedora
text: wearing eccentric in a motorized wheelchair-golf cart
text: contraption.
speaker_heading: FELDMAN
dialog: Excuse me - I can't read the trivia
dialog: question!
text: Enid is in the way. She reads it to him.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: "Where on the human body is the
dialog: 'Douglas Pouch' located?"
text: Feldman grunts and starts to tap away on his powerbook while
text: Rebecca, rolling her eyes, goes to get his coffee. A DIGITAL
text: GRAPHIC of the FEMALE FORM on his computer screen. With a
text: few keyboard strokes he zeroes in on a schematic of the
text: REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. An area behind the cervix BLINKS.
speaker_heading: FELDMAN
text: Slightly below the uterus on a female.
text: He takes his coffee and putters towards the door.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That guy is totally amazing.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: He does that every single day.
speaker_heading: YUPPIE #2
dialog: Can I get a decaf mocha to go?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Can I get you a...
speaker_heading: YUPPIE #2
dialog: NO, I don't want a biscotti with
dialog: that.
text: YUPPIE #2 pays and leaves.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: God, how can you stand all these
dialog: assholes?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't know... Some people are okay,
dialog: but mostly I feel like poisoning
dialog: everybody.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: At least the wheelchair guy is sort
dialog: of entertaining...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: He's a total asshole... He doesn't
dialog: even need that wheelchair, he's just
dialog: totally lazy!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That rules!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No, it doesn't. You'll see... you
dialog: get totally sick of all the creeps
dialog: and losers and weirdos.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: But those are our people...
speaker_heading: REBECCA

speaker_heading: ENID

speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Nothing. Don't worry... I promise

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Are you still looking for a job? Do

speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Will you get off my back for once?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It's tough to find a good job without

speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Look, I told you I'm not going to
dialog: college.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, I think it's good to keep all
dialog: your options open. You can always
dialog: enroll for the winter quarter. You
dialog: could even live here and go to the

speaker_heading: ENID

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: ENID

speaker_heading: ENID

speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You hang out with me because nobody

speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Or maybe... did you ever think that

speaker_heading: REBECCA

speaker_heading: ENID

text: MOVE IN CLOSER to her head as though entering her thoughts,
text: which slowly fade in: WE MOVE TOWARD a vertical sliver of
text: light -- a cracked-open bathroom door.
text: WE MOVE into the bathroom and see Enid taking a shower. Josh
text: enters, dressed in a black suit, holding a large bouquet of
text: flowers. CUT. We start again, exactly as before, only without
text: the flowers. He starts to take off his clothes. CUT. He enters

speaker_heading: ROBERTA

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It's a tampon in a teacup...
speaker_heading: Class GIGGLES.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I can see that... now what can you
dialog: tell us about it? First of all, what
dialog: kind of sculpture is this?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It's a "found object"... that's when
text: an artist takes an ordinary object
dialog: and places it in an artistic context
dialog: and thus it becomes art.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Very good. Now, what can you tell us
dialog: about it in regard to your artistic
dialog: intent?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I guess I see the teacup as a symbol
dialog: for womanhood, because of tea parties
dialog: in the olden days, but instead of
dialog: tea I was trying to kind of confront
dialog: people with this... like...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
text: This shocking image of repressed
dialog: femininity!
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Right, exactly!
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I think it's really a wonderful piece,

speaker_heading: SEYMOUR

dialog: Hey don't go away because we've got
text: Blueshammer coming up in just a
dialog: minute!
text: A CUTE GIRL, mid-20's, stands near their table sipping her

dialog: if to say, "check it out."
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yes, that would certainly do...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Well, offer her a seat! You want me
dialog: to do it?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I
dialog: gotta think of something to talk to
dialog: her about. No! No...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Just wait here.
text: Enid gets up before Seymour can stop her and talks to CUTE

speaker_heading: CUTE GIRL
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Hello. Uh... that was great music,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: CUTE GIRL
dialog: (sitting down)
dialog: Yeah, I just love blues.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Actually, technically what he was
dialog: mostly playing would more accurately
dialog: be classified in the "ragtime" idiom.
dialog: Although of course not in the
dialog: strictest sense of the more classical
dialog: ragtime piano music like that of
dialog: Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb. Authentic
dialog: Blues has a more conventional twelve-
text: bar structure in its stanzas.
speaker_heading: CUTE GIRL
dialog: Oh if you like authentic blues, you've
dialog: just gotta see Blueshammer! They're
dialog: so great!
text: ANGLE ON: Enid standing alone at the bar. We see Seymour and
text: Cute Girl from her POV. Her gaze drifts to the other people
text: in the bar. WE MOVE OVER the faces of all the guys and stop
text: on a skinny, introverted-looking guy with a pool-cue. He
text: makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue
text: twirling routine. Her gaze drifts on.
text: She sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off
text: her hat reconfiguring her hair. She reaches into her purse
text: and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses. This is interrupted
text: by BLUESHAMMER taking the stage. Young, white, cocky, pretty
dialog: boys.

text: sitting), spilling his drink as they vie to dance with her.
text: Seymour extricates himself from the table and walks toward
text: the bar where Enid sits.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: What did you tell that girl?
speaker_heading: ENID

speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It's not hopeless...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yeah, well it's simple for everybody
dialog: else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair
dialog: of Nikes and they're happy! I just
dialog: can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity
dialog: either, but I don't think it's totally
dialog: hopeless...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: But it's not totally hopeless for
dialog: you... I've had it. I don't even
dialog: have the energy to try anymore. You
dialog: should make sure you do the exact
dialog: opposite of everything I do so you
dialog: don't end up like me...
speaker_heading: ENID

speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: If you don't mind my asking -- why
dialog: do you care so much if I get a date

speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I dunno... because I can't stand the
dialog: idea of a world where a guy like you
dialog: can't get a date...
text: Enid finds a PAINTING leaning in a pile of stuff against the
text: wall in the corner. It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype
text: of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What the fuck, Seymour?! What is
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: What?... Oh that... I borrowed that
dialog: from work about fifteen years ago...
dialog: I guess it's mine now.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What, are you a klansman or something?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks
dialog: a lot!... Do you know the Cook's
dialog: Chicken franchise?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (quoting TV commercial
dialog: in deep voice)
dialog: "Four-piece Cook's special deep fried
dialog: with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made
dialog: up name. When they originally opened
dialog: back in 1922 they were named "The
dialog: Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early
dialog: painting of their first logo.
text: He takes out a scrapbook.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I'm obsessed with all this stuff -
dialog: this lost culture of the 20th century.
text: She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken
text: logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then
text: into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "Cook's
text: Chicken Inn." Then to a white version of the same chef,
text: followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's
text: version. On another page is a collection of cosmetic labels
text: tracing the design evolution of a different company.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Why doesn't everybody know this?
text: The record ends. Seymour gets up to take it off the turntable.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (somewhat bitterly)
dialog: It's ancient history. The same reason
dialog: nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco
dialog: record.
text: He puts on another record.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Actually, I was a whole lot more
dialog: interested in the Cook's phenomenon
dialog: when I was about your age. I've kind
dialog: of lost interest since I've been
dialog: working for them...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You work at Cook's Chicken?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: For nineteen years...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What are you, a fry cook or something?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Nothing so glamorous... actually,
dialog: I'm an assistant manager at their
dialog: corporate headquarters.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work
text: in an office all day.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Hey, I get good benefits, a good
dialog: early retirement plan, nobody ever
dialog: bothers me...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, but still...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I make enough money to eat and buy
dialog: old records... what more do I want?
text: Enid puts down the scrapbook, stares at the painting.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: So, I don't really get it -- are you
dialog: saying that things were better back
dialog: then
dialog: (points at painting)
dialog: even though there was stuff like
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: No, in a lot of ways things are better
dialog: now... I dunno... it's complicated.
dialog: Everybody still hates each other,
dialog: but they know how to hide it better,
dialog: or something...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Hey, can I borrow this?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I promise I'll take good care of it.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I dunno... they're very sensitive at

speaker_heading: SNOTTY GIRL
dialog: I don't like it.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Can you tell us why?
speaker_heading: SNOTTY GIRL
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: HIPPY-ISH BOY
dialog: I think it's totally weak.
speaker_heading: BLACK GIRL
dialog: Yeah, it's not right.
text: More kids respond at once. Even Margaret is confused.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: These are all valid comments, but I
dialog: think we should see if the artist
dialog: has anything to bring to this.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Well, I got the idea when I was doing
dialog: some research and I discovered that
dialog: Cook's Chicken used to be called
dialog: Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to
dialog: do my project based on this discovery
dialog: as kind of a comment on racism...
dialog: and the way racism is whitewashed
dialog: over in our culture...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Did you actually do this painting?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Well, no - it's more like a "found
dialog: art object."
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: And how do you think this addresses
dialog: the subject of racism?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It's complicated... I guess I'm trying
dialog: to show how racism used to -- more
text: out in the open and now it's hidden,
dialog: or something...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: And how does an image like this help
dialog: us to see that?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm not sure... I mean...
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: I guess because when we see something
dialog: like this it seems really shocking
dialog: and we have to figure out why it's
dialog: so shocking?
text: A long pause as Roberta and the class stare at the painting.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA

text: It's the next day. Enid has set up a GARAGE SALE in front of
text: her apartment building. Rebecca arrives.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: This is it? I can't believe you're
dialog: selling some of this stuff.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Fuck it. Everything must go!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh my god, I remember this hat...
dialog: this was during your little old lady
dialog: phase...
text: A trendy young HIPSTER happens along and looks through the
text: clothes, then to the table where he picks up a ridiculous
text: looking stuffed animal.
speaker_heading: HIPSTER
dialog: How much is this?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That's not for sale.
speaker_heading: HIPSTER
dialog: (noticing price tag)
dialog: Wait, it says five dollars...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh, that's a mistake -- I decided
dialog: not to sell it...
text: The HIPSTER looks around a little more and then leaves.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What was that all about? I thought
dialog: everything must go!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let
dialog: some asshole with a goatee own Goofy
dialog: Gus.
text: A couple is browsing. The GIRL, a severely skinny, CLUBHOPPER
text: TYPE in platform shoes looks at the clothes; the BOY, a long
text: haired SKATEBOARDER, goes through her records.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: How much is this dress?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh my god, you're selling that?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: That's five hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Five hundred.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You're crazy -- it should be like
dialog: two dollars!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I was wearing that dress the day I
dialog: lost my virginity.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Well why do I care about that?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Why do you even want it? It would
dialog: look stupid on you.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: God, fuck you!
text: Enid turns to the boy - he's holding some records and a book.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Put that stuff back, it's not for
dialog: sale.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: What is this? Some fuckin' joke?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yes! Go away!
text: They stomp off.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Now are you going to get a regular
dialog: job?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (defeated, quiet)
dialog: Don't worry.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: If it makes you feel any better, I
dialog: don't think you could've gotten more
dialog: than ten bucks for all this stuff.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, thanks.
scene_heading: EXT. ENID'S GARAGE SALE - DAY
text: Twenty minutes later. Most of the stuff is gone. Enid packs
text: up one last box to carry inside.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Do you want to do something tonight?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Shit! What time is it? I have to go
dialog: to the store! I was going to make
dialog: him a cake...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (miffed, sighs)
dialog: Well, are we still going shopping
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, I guess... call me...
text: She heads toward the stairs with the box. Rebecca watches
dialog: her go.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Since when can you make a cake?
scene_heading: INT. SEYMOUR'S ROOM - EVENING
text: Enid presents Seymour with a HOSTESS CUPCAKE with a single
text: lit candle in the center. The lights are off.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You can open your eyes now.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I
dialog: really appreciate it...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: No, Doofus... blow it out!
text: He leans forward and blows out the candle, then abruptly
text: straightens up and holds the small of his back in pain. Enid
text: turns the lights back on.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: It's just my stupid back. I'll be
dialog: all right in a minute...
text: She notices him adjust something under his shirt.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Oh... uh... It's just this elastic
dialog: thing I have to wear for lumbar
dialog: support...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What, like a girdle?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Maybe now you understand why I can't
dialog: get a date.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, well, you're not the only one.
dialog: Everybody I know has totally fucked
dialog: up problems... It seems like only
dialog: stupid people have good
dialog: relationships...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (sarcastically cheering
dialog: her on)
dialog: That's the spirit!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I mean, I'm eighteen years old and
dialog: I've never even had a real, steady
dialog: boyfriend for more than like two
dialog: weeks!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Never...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I'm starting to think that even if I
dialog: did get a girlfriend it really
dialog: wouldn't change anything.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I know. It's not like it makes all
dialog: your problems go away.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Then again, that's easy for me to
dialog: say, since I'll never even get a
dialog: date. I'm sure you have hundreds of
dialog: guys who are interested in you.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Actually, I've got a total crush on
dialog: this one guy right now, but it's a
dialog: really fucked-up situation...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh wait, you met him... remember
dialog: that guy Josh? I'm like practically
dialog: obsessed with him, but I can't do
dialog: anything about it because Becky would
dialog: freak out.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Never mind, it's way too
dialog: complicated...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Did you have problems like this when
dialog: you were my age - where you're totally
dialog: confused all the time?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I won't even dignify that with a
dialog: response.
text: He gets up and looks through his shelves for a record.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (looking at his records)
dialog: I wonder if you really like all these
dialog: old records or if you only like the
dialog: fact that nobody else likes them?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (a sore subject)
dialog: Who knows?
text: The phone RINGS. Seymour ignores it.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Aren't you going to get that?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Let the machine get it. I have no
dialog: desire to talk to anyone who would
dialog: be calling me...
text: After several more RINGS the machine picks up and we hear
text: Seymour's message. After the BEEP there's a long fumbling
dialog: pause...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I knew it... it's my mother.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON MACHINE
dialog: Uh... HI! Uh... I'm calling for...
dialog: um... you placed an ad in the Weekly
dialog: over a month ago and... well, I'm
text: the redhead in the yellow dress...
dialog: at least I think I am... I saw the
dialog: ad when you first placed it but I
dialog: was in this relationship at the time
dialog: so I cut it out, and now I'm not in
dialog: the relationship anymore...
dialog: (giggles)
dialog: God, this is really confusing...
dialog: anyway, if you still want to talk to
dialog: me I can be reached at KL5-2603,
dialog: that's my work number and my name is
dialog: Dana... um... BYE!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Wow!
dialog: (feigning ignorance)
dialog: What was that all about?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That didn't sound like a joke to
dialog: me... what, did you write a personal
dialog: ad or something?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (still confused)
dialog: Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called
dialog: before once... it's just somebody
dialog: trying to humiliate me.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a
dialog: joke -- you have to call her back!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: How can you be so sure?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff
dialog: like this -- she was totally for
dialog: real!
scene_heading: INT. ENID'S APARTMENT - ABOUT 10 PM
text: Enid enters - a light is on in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: DAD (O.S.)
dialog: Pumpkin? Could you come in here for
dialog: a minute?
text: She walks slowly to the kitchen - a suspenseful moment. She
text: sees, first, her Dad (wearing an apron) and then, a hauntingly
text: familiar MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Pumpkin, do you remember Maxine?
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: Hi, Enid.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hi.
dialog: (to Dad)
dialog: Look, I'm kind of tired - I think
dialog: I'll go to bed.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I-I really have to get up early for
dialog: class tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: It's really quite something to see
dialog: you all grown up like this, Enid.
dialog: (no response from
dialog: Enid)
dialog: I'd love to hear about what you're
dialog: doing. I can't help but feel that I
dialog: had some small part in how you turned
dialog: out...
dialog: (another silent pause)
dialog: What are you studying? You were always
dialog: such a smart little girl.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm taking a remedial high school
dialog: art class for fuck-ups and retards.
scene_heading: INT. ART CLASS - DAY
text: A toothy, zit-covered 14-YEAR-OLD BOY poses with a very poorly-
text: made sculpture. A flash goes off and he jumps slightly,
text: sending pieces of his sculpture flying.
text: It's Roberta, taking photos. She moves on to Enid, in front
dialog: of her big painting.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Smile, Enid...
text: Enid ad-libs a weird expression as... the flash goes off.
text: Roberta now turns to address the class.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm going to miss you people... I
dialog: feel that we've all done a lot of
dialog: growing this summer. I hope that
dialog: each of you feels as though you'll
dialog: be taking away something from this
dialog: experience; I know I certainly will
dialog: be...
text: A long "poignant" pause as she smiles admiringly at them.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Remember, the art show is this
dialog: Saturday at seven-thirty sharp. Try
dialog: to get there at least 15 minutes
dialog: early.
text: The students get their things together and file out.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Uh-oh.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I
dialog: was just wondering what your plans
dialog: were for next year?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm not really sure - working, I
dialog: guess...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, I know this is really short
dialog: notice, but I got a call from a very
dialog: close friend at the Academy of Art &amp;
dialog: Design and she tells me that I'm
dialog: allowed to place one student from
dialog: your graduating class in a one year
dialog: scholarship program... and, well, I
dialog: hope you don't mind, Enid, but I
dialog: took the liberty of submitting your
dialog: name.
text: She gives her a booklet and an application form.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hmm.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: As far as I know it includes housing
dialog: and meals and everything... it is
dialog: really quite an offer...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: ...wow...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So what do you think?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I dunno... Would I have to take
dialog: classes and stuff?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well, yes...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Let me know as soon as you can, Enid.
dialog: This could be a great thing for you.
scene_heading: INT. INDOOR SHOPPING MALL - DAY
text: Enid &amp; Rebecca are in a Crate &amp; Barrel-type store looking at
dialog: housewares.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I think one of us should fuck Josh...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Go ahead...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: No, really...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: God, you're really obsessed...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I am not -- I just think it'd be
dialog: funny to see what he'd do...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I thought we decided that Josh was
dialog: way too cool to be interested in
dialog: sex, and that he's the only decent
dialog: person left in the world and we would
dialog: never want to bring him down to our
dialog: level and all that...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, but maybe one of us should at
dialog: least try...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No matter what happened it would be
dialog: a big disaster... Let's just try and
dialog: keep everything the way it is.
text: Rebecca spots some particularly fetching dishware.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Look, we have to get these...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I can't afford stuff like this right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm sick of waiting - we need to
dialog: start getting stuff if we're ever
dialog: going to move.
dialog: (pause, sees towels)
dialog: Aren't these the greatest towels?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Why do you care about this kind of
dialog: stuff?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Don't you want nice stuff?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I can't imagine spending money on
dialog: towels.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You don't have to. I'll pay for all
dialog: the stuff right now and you can pay
dialog: me back when you finally get a job.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You're insane.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Do you still want to go to that thing
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What thing?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That guy's band is playing tonight...
dialog: Alien Autopsy.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going
dialog: on his big date tonight and I kind
dialog: of want to be around when he calls,
dialog: so I can hear how bad it went.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
scene_heading: INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - EVENING
text: Seymour is just finishing the dinner DANA has cooked for
text: them at her place. Dana is an attractive redhead, about 40.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: That was great - jeez, thanks again
dialog: for cooking all this.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Oh I love to cook. I guess most women
dialog: wouldn't invite a man over on the
dialog: first date, but I believe you should
dialog: trust your instincts. When I talked
dialog: to you on the phone you just seemed
dialog: so... I don't know... harmless. Ready
dialog: for ice cream?
text: Dana heads for the kitchen. Seymour gets up to relieve his
text: backache. He walks over to a framed photo on the wall.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Here we are... it's mocha mint from
dialog: Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that
dialog: photograph just heart-rending?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Was it Bosnia? I forget...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire
dialog: country eloquently captured in the
text: face of one little boy.
dialog: (pause)
text: A Soul/Funk song starts up on the
text: radio that catches her attention.
text: She goes over and turns it up.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it
dialog: great? Doesn't it make you want to
dialog: dance? C'mon!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance,
dialog: heh, heh...
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Don't be silly, anyone can dance.
dialog: Here, just follow me... watch my
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: No, really I --
text: She drags him around. He's still holding his ice cream.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: C'mon Seymour, it's all in your mind.
dialog: Just loosen up and feel the music!
dialog: Here, put down your bowl of ice cream.
text: She takes his ice cream and puts it on a table.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (checking his watch)
dialog: Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're
dialog: gonna have to leave now if we're
dialog: going to make that movie.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just
dialog: let me put a few things away.
text: She shuts off the stereo as he sits and eats his ice cream.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: I'm so excited to see this film -
dialog: Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant
dialog: director! Did you see his last film,
dialog: The Flower That Drank The Moon? It
dialog: was simply glorious!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Uh, no. I missed that one. But what
dialog: do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy
dialog: movies.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Really? I never really cared for
dialog: those. Why does the fat one always
dialog: have to be so mean to the skinny
dialog: one?
scene_heading: INT. ENID'S ROOM - EVENING
text: It's 9:30 PM. Enid is drawing in her sketchbook. She looks

scene_heading: INT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Seymour picks up the phone. Dana is in the background getting

speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hi, it's me...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Oh, hi...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: So, what happened?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (almost whispering)
dialog: Actually, it's kind of still
dialog: happening... she's over here right
dialog: now... I think everything's going
dialog: pretty well...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What? You're kidding me...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yeah, so I better go -- it's not
dialog: really the best time to talk...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What, are you going to like have sex
dialog: with her on your first date?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you
dialog: later... bye!
text: He hangs up. Enid is stunned... Now what? She calls Rebecca.
scene_heading: INT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Rebecca is sitting on the couch in her pajamas when the phone
text: RINGS. She picks it up.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Do you still want to do something
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What happened to Seymour?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (still shocked by
dialog: this)
dialog: I can't believe it - he actually
dialog: scored!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: How repulsive!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: So should I come over?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Actually, I'm just about to go out
dialog: with some friends...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What are you talking about? Who?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Just some people from work...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I don't believe you.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yeah well, you said you were busy...
dialog: look, I'd better get going... I'll
dialog: call you tomorrow.
text: Rebecca hangs up. Clearly, she's not going anywhere.
scene_heading: EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Enid stands outside Josh's door. A tentative pause; then she
text: knocks. Josh opens the door, stunned. Enid is wearing an
text: uncharacteristically "sexy" outfit.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Hi... what's up?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Can I come in?
scene_heading: INT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: She goes in and looks around nervously... the note (Tiffany
text: &amp; Amber) is tacked to the wall.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Are you the one who left that note?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I guess.
text: Pause. Enid sits down on futon/sofa.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: So what's up?
text: He picks up half-finished beer and drinks self-consciously.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I don't know... I'm totally
dialog: confused...
text: Josh doesn't respond - there's another awkward pause.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Sit over here.
text: He sits, tentatively. Long pause.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Do you want something to drink?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What do you mean "why"?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Are you trying to get me wasted so
dialog: you can take advantage of my womanly
dialog: charms?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah, right...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: "Yeah, right"... well why not? What's
dialog: so wrong with me?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Then why do you hate me so much?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: When did I say I hated you?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You've never once said anything even
dialog: remotely nice to me.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You make me nervous! I always feel
dialog: like you're going out of your way to
dialog: make me feel uncomfortable so you
dialog: can laugh at me!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That's just the way I am!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah, well --
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It's just my stupid way of getting
dialog: attention! God, I practically love
dialog: you, Josh!
text: Stunned pause, then she bravely leans forward and kisses
text: him. He kisses back but she is clearly the aggressor...
text: they get more and more into it.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Do you have any protection?
scene_heading: INT. JOSH'S APT. - 1 AM.
text: Later, post-coital on the now unfolded futon... Enid lies on
text: her back, Josh is face-down on top of her with his head to
text: the side. Enid has a blank, disillusioned stare.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (now he's romantic
dialog: and sappy)
dialog: You must have known all along how I --
dialog: you know -- how I felt about you --
dialog: it must be totally obvious... God...
dialog: I always used to dream about this...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (staring ahead)
dialog: Why do you have that stupid poster?
scene_heading: INT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: It's the next morning. Josh is asleep. Enid, fully awake and
text: dressed, sits on the bed looking at him, thoroughly
text: disillusioned. She pulls out a record from his collection
text: and grimaces. She opens a closet door and finds an electric
dialog: guitar.
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: (waking up, groggy,
dialog: happily surprised)
dialog: Oh, hi...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Why do all guys have to play stupid
dialog: guitars? It's so typical... Either
dialog: they're into cars or guns or sports
dialog: or guitars... it's so obvious...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: How long have you been up?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I couldn't sleep... I should get
dialog: going; I feel really weird...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Do you want to go get breakfast
dialog: somewhere?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I don't think we should... Look, you
dialog: have to totally promise me you won't
dialog: tell Becky about this.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Because if you do, I'll kill you!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Okay... I promise.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Just take my word for it... if she
dialog: ever finds out about this I'll never
dialog: hear the end of it...

speaker_heading: ENID

speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: No, actually Joe told me you were

speaker_heading: SEYMOUR

speaker_heading: ENID

dialog: you know...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: So, what kind of stuff do you guys

dialog: and stuff?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Sort of... she doesn't dislike any

speaker_heading: SEYMOUR

dialog: Aren't you even going to ask me how
dialog: I'm doing?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I dunno... okay, I guess...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I fucked that guy Josh finally...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: ...so... is he your boyfriend now?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be,
dialog: of course. I'm weighing several offers
dialog: at the present time...
text: Suddenly, Dana enters.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess
dialog: I'm a little early...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Dana! Hi!
dialog: (pause as the gears
dialog: whirl)
dialog: Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Hello...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It's great to finally meet you!
text: Dana sits next to Seymour, facing Enid.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: (looking back and
dialog: forth between Enid
dialog: and Seymour)
dialog: How do you two know each other?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm surprised he hasn't mentioned me
dialog: we're old friends.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yes, we're very close... In fact, I
text: was standing right next to Seymour
dialog: the first time you called. If not
dialog: for me, he would have never called
dialog: you back!
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Is that right?
text: Seymour begins to stammer some kind of response.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (phony)
dialog: Oops! Look at the time! I've got to
dialog: run! I'll stop by to see you some
dialog: time, Seymour...
dialog: (then to Dana)
dialog: It was really great to meet you!
scene_heading: INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING
text: Enid is in her room getting dressed. Dad enters.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I have some good news for you,
dialog: Pumpkin.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: What is it now?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Are you still looking for a job?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, Maxine thinks she can get you
text: a sales job at Computer Station.
dialog: Normally you have to have references
dialog: and at least two years of experience,
text: but she thinks she can convince them.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Tell her to forget it - I don't need
dialog: her help.
scene_heading: INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING
text: A homemade banner reads: "HIGH SCHOOL ART SHOW - BROTHERHOOD
text: AND COMMUNITY: ART AS DIALOGUE." Along one wall is all the
text: work from Roberta's class: a collection of eccentric abstract
text: bric-a-brac and Enid's large painting. The painting has drawn
text: a small crowd. We see a chain of events beginning with three
text: PARENTS talking to a matronly DIRECTOR/CURATOR who in turn
text: seeks out Roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish clothes for
dialog: the first time).
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: I'm afraid you're simply going to
dialog: have to take that painting down.
dialog: Several of the parents have
dialog: complained.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I will do no such thing.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Then you leave me no other choice
dialog: than to remove it myself!
text: She marches towards it. Roberta runs after her.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I think we should give the artist a
dialog: chance to talk to the parents about
dialog: her intentions with this piece...
dialog: We should be promoting discussion as
dialog: a solution, not censorship.
text: Roberta sees Margaret and grabs her.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Margaret, have you seen Enid?
text: Margaret shrugs "no." ROBERTA looks through the crowd. A
text: college-age news-hack-type with a FREE WEEKLY T-SHIRT snaps
text: a photo of the DIRECTOR removing Enid's painting.
scene_heading: EXT. SEYMOUR'S APT. BLDG. - EVENING
text: Enid, dressed as though for a glamorous date, stands knocking
text: on Seymour's door.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Oh... uh, hi... What's up?
scene_heading: INT. SEYMOUR'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS
text: Enid worms her way past his unwelcoming stance. Seymour is
text: wearing designer stone-washed denim jeans that look ridiculous
text: on him. Joe can be seen in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm going to this stupid art show
dialog: and I want you to be my date...
dialog: There's something I have to show
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I... I don't know. I don't really
dialog: think I should...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Of course you should. C'mon, I'm
text: already a million hours late.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: ...I better not...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well forget the art show... let's do
dialog: something else.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I... I wish I could, Enid, but I
dialog: really can't right now... I -- it's
dialog: just that I --
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Well when can we do something?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: It's just that, well, you know, Dana
dialog: just got out of a really bad
dialog: relationship and I don't want to
dialog: give her the wrong idea... you know...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (walking by with his
dialog: sandwich)
dialog: Don't mind me, I'll just be in my
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Where did you get those pants?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Oh, uh... they were a present from
dialog: Dana.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: And you like them?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Well, you know... what do I know
dialog: about clothes... I've never been the
dialog: most fashionable guy -- it's nice to
dialog: have someone do all the work for
dialog: me...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So that's it? You don't ever want to
dialog: see me again?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: No, of course I do... It's just that
dialog: right now I need to --
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What's her problem anyway? Did she
dialog: actually tell you you couldn't see
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: No, no... not exactly... she just
dialog: doesn't understand how I would know
dialog: somebody like you...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What does she mean by that - "somebody
dialog: like me"?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Just someone so young...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You must have done something to make
dialog: her think you like me.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I... I don't think so.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Does that mean you don't like me?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: No, of course not.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (looks him in the eye)
dialog: So, do you like me, Seymour?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: In what way do you mean?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: In whatever way you think I mean.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (not sure what to
dialog: say; long pause)
dialog: I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's
dialog: a very jealous person. I just don't
dialog: want to screw that up right now...
dialog: I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we
dialog: can go back to being friends...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I don't think you understand how I
dialog: really feel about you, Seymour.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: ...What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother
dialog: you any more.
scene_heading: EXT. ENID'S NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING
text: A LONG SHOT of Enid as she walks home alone.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: Enid &amp; Rebecca walk down the street. Both wear landlord
text: friendly J. Crew outfits.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Where are we? This is a weird
dialog: neighborhood...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It's a totally normal, average
dialog: neighborhood!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I just mean it's weird to me...
dialog: I've never been anywhere near here
dialog: in my life.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Josh says this is a really good
dialog: neighborhood...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What? When did you see Josh?!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: He came into work.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Why? What did he say?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: When was this?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't know! God, don't act so
dialog: jealous I only talked to him for two
dialog: minutes.
text: They walk along in conspicuous silence.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you
dialog: see it?
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: That must be it...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (without enthusiasm)
dialog: Great...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What?! It looks totally normal...
dialog: what's wrong with it?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I said "great"...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh yeah, I can tell you really love
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Well, what am I supposed to say? "I
dialog: can't wait to live in some depressing
dialog: shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: There's something wrong with every
dialog: single place we look at! Why don't
dialog: you just come right out and tell me
dialog: you don't want to move in with me?!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Because you'll freak out and act
text: like a total psycho about it.
text: A few passersby stop to watch.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You're the psycho! You haven't been
dialog: able to deal with anything since
dialog: high school ended!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You're the one who's still living
dialog: out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
text: (as she walks away
dialog: giving her the finger)
dialog: FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your
dialog: dad for the rest of your life!
scene_heading: INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY
text: Enid is on her bed, crying. Her jacket and shoes are strewn
text: about the floor.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: God FUCK YOU TOO!
text: We see her Dad standing outside her bedroom. As he enters he
text: tries to make enough noise so that she notices him before
text: she really embarrasses herself. She stops crying and pretends
dialog: to be asleep.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Pumpkin? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (her back to him,
dialog: doesn't move)
dialog: Nothing.
text: Dad sits next to her on the bed and puts his hand on her
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: If there's something wrong I wish
dialog: you'd tell me about it...
text: Enid pulls away from him and sits up on the opposite side of
text: the bed, facing away from him
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It's nothing -- it's just some
dialog: hormonal thing... don't worry about
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I've got some important news to tell
dialog: you, but it can wait till later if
dialog: you're not feeling...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (speaking slowly and
dialog: methodically)
dialog: Well... as you know, Maxine and I
dialog: have been seeing a lot of each other,
dialog: and we decided it might be a good
dialog: idea for all of us if she came back
dialog: here to live at the end of the Summer,
dialog: just so we can all get to know each
dialog: other and to make sure this is what
dialog: we want.
text: Enid maintains a poker face for several long seconds before
text: she bursts into tears, utterly defeated.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALL - DAY
text: Enid, determined, walks down the empty halls. She goes into
text: a room marked "Art Class".
scene_heading: INT. ART CLASS - CONTINUOUS
text: Roberta is in there with a bearded EX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE.
text: They're covering a STUDENT in plaster.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hi I brought over my application for
dialog: the art academy... I hope it's not
dialog: too late...
text: Roberta, absorbed in her plastering, glances at Enid.
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Just a minute...
text: Then, realizing who it is...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Enid! I'm so sorry about what
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: The whole business with the art show
dialog: and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I didn't check my messages...
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Oh my goodness... well, the whole
dialog: thing is just ridiculous, and as
text: soon as the school board is back in
dialog: session next Fall I'm going to do
dialog: everything I can to help you.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Help me what?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: Well they're forcing me to give you
dialog: a non-passing grade in the class
dialog: because of what happened at the
dialog: exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm
dialog: sure I'll be able to get you your
dialog: diploma in the Fall!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (pause, overwhelmed)
dialog: But... can I still get that
dialog: scholarship to the Art Academy?
speaker_heading: ROBERTA
dialog: I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an
dialog: official high school graduate before
dialog: I can nominate you. I had to give
dialog: it to someone else... But I'm sure
dialog: next year I can --
text: The PLASTER-COVERED STUDENT makes an uncomfortable moaning
dialog: noise.
scene_heading: EX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE
dialog: (flustered, to Roberta)
dialog: Hey, can you help me out over here?
scene_heading: EXT. QUALITY CAFE - EVENING (SAME DAY)
text: Enid walks the streets - it's dark out now. She goes by the
text: Cafe - it's CLOSED FOR REMODELING.
scene_heading: EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - LATER
text: She continues walking until she's across the street from
text: Norman's bus stop. She sees him there, as always. Suddenly,
text: a BUS, well-lit from the inside and completely empty, pulls
text: up to the stop and Norman gets on.
scene_heading: INT. SEYMOUR'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (ABOUT 11 PM)
text: A knock on the door - Seymour shuffles out in T-shirt, pants,
text: and goofy slippers. He looks through the peephole and sees
text: Enid. He opens the door.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I had to see you.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Can you at least let me in?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Uh... sure... come in.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Look, I just need somebody to be
dialog: nice to me for five minutes and then
dialog: I'll leave you alone.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Do you have anything to drink?
text: Enid goes to look for herself.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Uh... I think there's some root
dialog: beer...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What about this?
text: She returns from the kitchen with a giant bottle of champagne.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be
dialog: saving it for our two-month
dialog: anniversary. You better not --
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (as she starts opening)
dialog: FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
text: She opens it and drinks straight from the bottle. Seymour's
dialog: look says: "Oh well, I'm fucked, I give up."
scene_heading: INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Enid &amp; Seymour sit on the bed listening to old records and
text: drinking out of the bottle.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You need a bigger place - this is
text: like a little kid's room.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I could never move - I've got too
dialog: much stuff.
text: Enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner.
text: She goes over and picks it up.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Where did you get this?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Dana bought it when we went antique
dialog: shopping. She said it didn't go with
dialog: her stuff, so she gave it to me...
dialog: she thought it fit in better with my
dialog: "old time thingamajigs."
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Jesus, how can you stand her?
text: Seymour takes another slug off the bottle.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: God, she's going to kill me... this
dialog: bottle is half-empty!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: That's great! "Half-empty" - that's
dialog: what I like about you, Seymour, you're
dialog: a natural pessimist!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: If you expect the worst, you're never
dialog: disappointed.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What are you talking about? You're
dialog: disappointed every minute of your
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I'm just being realistic.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: At least you're not like every other
dialog: stupid guy in the world - all they
dialog: care about are guitars and sports...
dialog: they're all such fags!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I hate sports.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: How come in all that time I was trying
dialog: to get you a date, you never asked
dialog: me out?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: You're a beautiful young girl... I
dialog: can't imagine you would ever have
dialog: had any interest in me, except as an
text: amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, but still... it's kind of
dialog: insulting for a girl to be ignored
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I mean... of course I... why wouldn't
dialog: I want to go out with you?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I dunno... I always feel like
dialog: everybody secretly hates me. I'm
dialog: just paranoid I guess. I mean, you
dialog: like me don't you? We're good friends,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yeah, sure. Of course.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (contemplative pause)
dialog: ...Maybe I should just move in here
dialog: with you... I could do all the cooking
dialog: and dust your record collection and
dialog: stuff until I get a job.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: What about Joe?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh yeah... and Dana...
dialog: (says her name with
text: whiny, disdainful
dialog: voice)
dialog: You were a lot more fun before you
dialog: met Dana. You've been acting way too
dialog: normal lately... you're a bitter,
dialog: twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour,
dialog: that's why I like you.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (more drunk than before)
dialog: Yeah, well I like you too...
scene_heading: TEN MINUTES LATER
text: The bottle is empty.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You know what my number one fantasy
dialog: used to be?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I used to think about one day not
dialog: telling anybody and just taking off
dialog: and going to some random place...
dialog: Do you ever think about stuff like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I guess I probably used to when I
dialog: was your age.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It would have to be some totally
dialog: average day when nobody was expecting
dialog: it, and I'd just disappear and they'd
dialog: never see me again.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Sounds like a healthy way to deal
dialog: with your problems.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: You know what we should do? Let's go
dialog: get in your car right now and just
dialog: take off! We could just drive away
dialog: and find some new place and start a
dialog: whole new life... fuck everybody!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I don't think I'm in any condition
dialog: to drive.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in
dialog: a blaze of glory!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: So where would we go?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Who cares? Let's just go... what's
dialog: stopping us?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I dunno, I...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm serious! I'm just so sick of
dialog: everybody! Why can't I just do
dialog: whatever I want?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I-I-I...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What's the matter with you, Seymour?
dialog: Don't you like me? Be a man for once
dialog: in your life!
text: She kisses him passionately. He's shocked but kisses back.
text: This escalates, leading to the sex act, shown with merciful
dialog: brevity.
dialog: WE SEE Enid &amp; Seymour, post-coital.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: God, Dana's going to kill you!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: ...Do you really want us to drive
dialog: away somewhere?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I will if you want to.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: No... forget it...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (embarrassingly sappy)
dialog: I-I never expected anything like
dialog: this to happen...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Yeah, well... me neither...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: You must know I always... did you
dialog: really mean all that about moving in
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I was just thinking out loud...
dialog: (doesn't want to hurt
dialog: his feelings)
dialog: I mean, you've got this whole thing
dialog: with Dana -- I'm not going to let
dialog: you fuck that up...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: But, I...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Shhh... I really need to get some
dialog: sleep.
text: Enid turns her back to him. We see from REVERSE ANGLE that
text: she's only pretending to be asleep. She looks troubled, as
text: though she's just made a big mistake. Seymour puts his arm
text: around her. It's the only time we've seen him look relaxed
dialog: and happy.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Good night...
text: He kisses her arm and goes to sleep.
scene_heading: INT. SEYMOUR'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Seymour wakes up. Enid is gone.
scene_heading: INT. DANA'S OFFICE - EXPANSION REALTY - DAY
text: Dana is on the phone. A lantern-jawed male COLLEAGUE listens
text: in, his head pressed up against hers.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: It's a thirty-year fixed at five and-
dialog: a-half...
text: Seymour nervously enters her "workspace". Dana is pleasantly
text: surprised - she stops her conversation.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: (covering receiver)
dialog: Seymour! Hello! What are you doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt
dialog: finish your phone call.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: We're almost done.
dialog: (she continues into
dialog: phone)
dialog: Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded.
dialog: They've already paid the earnest
dialog: money... well, let them bring it up
text: if they notice it at the final walk
dialog: through. Right, great, sounds good!
text: She hangs up and high-fives her colleague. They bear-hug.
speaker_heading: COLLEAGUE
dialog: Great job! I'm proud of ya! Well,
dialog: I'll check you guys later. I'm gonna
dialog: go start the paperwork.
text: Colleague leaves; Dana turns to Seymour.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Hey... so, what brings you down here?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I uh... I feel that I need to uh --
dialog: there's something I feel I have to
dialog: say... I uh, I've never said this to
dialog: anyone before -- believe me, I've
dialog: stayed in horrible relationships for
dialog: years just so I wouldn't have to do
dialog: this, but I uh...
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: What are you trying to say?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: It's just that I feel like it's maybe
dialog: not a good idea for us to keep going
dialog: out.
text: Dana sits down, staring ahead, stunned for a moment. Suddenly
text: she breaks down sobbing.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I-I honestly never intended for this
dialog: to happen...
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Enid and I were just friends. You
dialog: know... we feel comfortable around
dialog: each other... she really likes my
dialog: old records and...
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: I can't believe this! I thought at
dialog: the very least a guy like you would
dialog: never pull this kind of shit on me!
text: She starts crying again. Seymour awkwardly tries to comfort
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Dana, I... um...
text: Dana pushes him away violently.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: You disgusting pig! You're just an
dialog: overgrown baby who can't deal with a
dialog: woman your own age. You pathetic
dialog: weakling! You make me sick!
scene_heading: INT. ENID'S ROOM - THE SAME DAY
text: Enid is now utterly defeated. The phone rings. She lets the
text: machine pick it up. Maxine enters.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: May I ask what you're doing?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Shhh!
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: I want to know what you think you're
dialog: doing, staying out all night and
dialog: worrying your father to death!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
speaker_heading: MAXINE
dialog: Listen, young lady... I know you
dialog: don't like me -- I don't really care
dialog: whether you do or not -- but I will
dialog: not allow you to treat your father
dialog: the way you do.
text: We hear Seymour on the machine in the background...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR (V.O.)
dialog: I really want to talk to you. I've
dialog: been thinking about what you said
dialog: about moving in here...
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I can treat him any way I want to -
dialog: I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
text: Maxine leaves. Seymour finishes his message. Enid picks up
text: the phone and dials.
speaker_heading: REBECCA (V.O.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I need to talk to you.
scene_heading: INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY
text: Enid &amp; Rebecca sit at a table. Rebecca is wearing her uniform.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm sorry about the other day. I
dialog: don't know what's wrong with me...
dialog: I really do want to move in with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't know... I was thinking maybe
dialog: I should live alone. I decided to
dialog: rent that place we looked at. I'm
dialog: moving in next week.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Please let me come with you. Please
dialog: please please...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't know - I'm not sure it's a
dialog: good idea.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Of course it's a good idea... it's
dialog: our plan.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: But how are you gonna pay rent and
dialog: everything? You don't even have a
dialog: job.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise.
dialog: If I don't, you can totally tell me
dialog: to fuck off.
scene_heading: INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE MORNING
text: Enid is putting on her shoes. Her Dad opens the door slightly
text: and sticks his head in.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Pumpkin, are you in there?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Are you going to yell at me?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, I heard about that.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I was in a horrible mood - tell her
dialog: not to worry, I'll be completely out
dialog: of her life in a few days.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: She understands what you're going
dialog: through and she really wants to help
dialog: you. She says that job at Computer
dialog: Station is still available if you
dialog: want it.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Actually, I was just checking to see
dialog: if you were here - your friend Seymour
text: is on his way up.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What do you mean "on his way up"!?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I just buzzed him in.
text: Just then, three sharp KNOCKS on the front door.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm
dialog: not here!
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: But I can't --
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: JUST DO IT!
text: Dad goes to answer the door. Enid hides in her room.
speaker_heading: DAD (V.O.)
dialog: I'm not sure when she'll be back...
text: Enid looks out the window and sees Seymour walking away. She
text: has a terribly sad look on her face.
scene_heading: INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique "candlestick"
text: telephone. In the background, a Peter, Paul and Mary concert
text: plays on the TV. We hear three rings followed by Enid's
text: answering machine message. He hangs up before it finishes.
text: Joe walks by the doorway.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, here's where the fun never
dialog: stops!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yeah, I'm really, really happy.
dialog: Really having a good time.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Still torturing yourself over that
dialog: Enid, huh?
text: Seymour doesn't answer. He looks away.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Where else am I ever going to find
text: another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley
dialog: records?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: She could at least have the decency
dialog: to call me back.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Maybe she was just using you to try
dialog: and get back at some guy. Who knows?
dialog: It could be a million things. It's
dialog: wasted time trying to logically figure
dialog: out the female brain, that's for
dialog: sure.
text: Again no answer from Seymour, he stares off into space.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (bummed out, wants
dialog: Joe to stop)
dialog: Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: No problem.
text: Seymour looks so miserable that even Joe has some compassion
dialog: for him.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Look at it this way - at least things
dialog: can't get any worse.
text: Joe leaves. Seymour is left listening to the record.
scene_heading: INT. COOK'S CHICKEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY.
text: Seymour is at work, walking down a carpeted hallway with
text: many doors on both sides. A door opens and a Tony Robbins-
text: ish, 35 year-old MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE sticks his head out.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Seymour! Just the man I want to see.
dialog: Step in here for a minute.
text: Seymour enters.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Have a seat.
text: He plunks down the current issue of THE FREE WEEKLY - it's
text: open to a 1/2 page article on page 8 with the headline "Oh
text: Brother!" and a photo of THE PAINTING being removed.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: What can you tell me about this,
dialog: Seymour?
scene_heading: INT. ENID &amp; REBECCA'S NEW APT.
text: Enid is wearing a bright orange "Computer Station" T-shirt
text: and a yellow vest with a "trainee" tag. She's looking around
text: at her new home: a hopelessly drab, characterless apartment.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: So, whaddya think?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It's fine.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: So where's all your stuff?
text: Enid points to a small box with sketchbook, etc.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: There.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That's all you're bringing?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I'm gonna finish packing tonight...
dialog: I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What time?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: I dunno...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Make sure you're here by noon - we
dialog: have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah!
dialog: I have to show you something else!
text: She drags Enid into the kitchen and opens a BUILT-IN IRONING
text: BOARD as though it's the most amazing thing she's ever-seen.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Isn't this the greatest?
scene_heading: INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE EVENING
text: Enid is sorting her stuff into boxes. Digging through her
text: closet, she finds a box that she doesn't recognize. Inside
text: are her old children's records (45's). She excitedly takes
text: one out and plays it. She folds her clothes while listening
text: to this song, which clearly is getting to her. She grabs
text: mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. It's
text: the uniform from her job at "Computer Station." She folds
text: it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange
dialog: fabric.
scene_heading: INT. ENID AND REBECCA'S APT. - THE NEXT DAY
text: Rebecca is nervously arranging and re-arranging her stuff.
text: She puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the
text: time to 12:45. She goes to the phone and calls Enid. The
text: machine picks up and Rebecca hangs up. She does another
text: tedious, pointless task. IT'S NOW 3:30. She's pissed off and
text: goes to the phone to call again. As it rings there's a knock
text: on the door. Relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
text: (as she opens the
dialog: door)
dialog: What's wrong with you, retard - it's
dialog: three-thirty!
text: It's Seymour standing there, not Enid.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother
dialog: told me I'd find her here?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: She's not at home?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: No... they said she was here...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What the fuck is she doing?! She was
dialog: supposed to be here three hours ago!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really
dialog: need to talk to her.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (allows him to step
text: inside but leaves
dialog: the door open)
dialog: Are you sure she wasn't there? Maybe
dialog: she was just hiding from you.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Why would she be hiding from me?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't know... where is she, then?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Maybe she's with Josh?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Why? What did she tell you?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: She just mentioned him a few times
dialog: and said that they had been dating -
dialog: I thought maybe she was...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What? Is she having some secret affair
dialog: with Josh?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I have no idea - I just want to...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no
dialog: way! She could never keep that to
dialog: herself... you're crazy.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Really, I don't know enough about it
dialog: to...
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That slut!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: (changing subject
dialog: back to me)
dialog: Why did you say she might be hiding
dialog: from me? Did she say anything to you
dialog: about me?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (getting revenge on
dialog: Seymour)
dialog: Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Did she say that?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Look, what do you expect? Considering
dialog: how we met you.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
text: On that pathetic fake blind date.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Didn't she ever tell you about that?
dialog: God, she really is pathological...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: What fake blind date? What are you
dialog: talking about?
text: Rebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box
text: and flips through it. When she gets to the right page she
text: hands it to Seymour.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Here. Read it and weep.
text: We see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR
text: in Wowsville. On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH
text: with his name surrounded by RED HEARTS.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON
text: Seymour's car screeches into the parking lot. He bursts into
text: the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene.
scene_heading: INT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON
text: Josh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee machine,
text: with his back to the entrance, as Seymour storms in. Doug is
text: over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I hope you had a good laugh at my
dialog: expense.
text: Josh turns around - what's going on? He recognizes Seymour.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Huh... oh... hi... uh...
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: You want to see something funny?
dialog: I'll show you something funny!
text: As he says this he flips over a SMALL DISPLAY RACK of potato
text: chips. Then he tries to flip over a BIG DISPLAY CASE in front
text: of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying
text: and gets more and more frustrated.
speaker_heading: JOSH
speaker_heading: HEY!
text: Josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he
text: creates a huge mess. He tries to grab Seymour and they get
text: into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. Seymour starts yelling.
text: Suddenly Doug appears and gets Seymour in a choke hold with
text: his nunchucks. Doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. Josh is freaked
text: out. Seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry.
text: The Boss comes out of the back room...
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: Josh! What going on here?!
scene_heading: INT. ENID &amp; REBECCA'S APARTMENT - AROUND MIDNIGHT
text: The apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh, annoying
text: streetlight. Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes,
text: exasperated. She goes to look out the window. Cars with loud
text: radios can be heard driving by. She goes to the phone - she
text: checks it and hangs up. Pause. She picks it up again - one
text: last try. She dials the number and waits. We hear the BEEP
text: of the answering machine. Rebecca hangs up.
text: She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a
text: cold linoleum floor). She zips the zipper all the way over
text: her head and curls up into a whimpering ball.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: "SEVERAL MONTHS LATER"
scene_heading: INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The dialogue begins in voice-over as the title card fades.
text: We slowly fade in to see Seymour, lying on a pink pastel
text: psychiatrist's couch, as he speaks to his THERAPIST, a
text: handsome, well-coiffed woman in her late 40s.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: I have to admit, things have really
dialog: started looking up for me since my
dialog: life turned to shit.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: So tell me more about this job.
dialog: What exactly will you be doing?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Well, mostly archival research,
dialog: cataloguing old records and writing
text: liner notes for their CD reissues.
dialog: It's really... I can't believe it.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Remember what I said when we first
dialog: started -- this little breakdown
dialog: might turn out to be the best thing
dialog: that ever happened to you!
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: It doesn't pay very much, but I should
dialog: be able to afford my own place in a
dialog: few months... Do you think that's
dialog: too soon? I'm really anxious to get
dialog: my record collection out of storage...
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Why don't we start with that next
dialog: week?
text: Seymour looks up. She nods toward the large wall clock behind
text: her: thirty seconds after five. Re gets up and she walks him
text: slowly toward the door.
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Thank you, doctor.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
text: (as she opens the
dialog: door)
dialog: Don't thank me. You're doing all the
dialog: work.
text: A pause. They stand facing each other.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Seymour?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Do you have a check for me?
text: Seymour takes a filled-out check from his shirt pocket. In
text: the waiting room, we see SEYMOUR'S MOTHER.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Seymour? Are you done? Did you have
dialog: a chance to think about what you
dialog: might want for dinner while you were
dialog: in there?
speaker_heading: SEYMOUR
dialog: We can talk about it in the car,
dialog: Ma...
text: As they leave Seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the
dialog: doctor.
scene_heading: INT. QUALITY CAFE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The Cafe has been FULLY REMODELED and now resembles Wowsville
dialog: more than the old Quality Cafe. There are no neighborhood
dialog: "characters" anymore, only well-heeled twenty-somethings. We
text: see that Rebecca is now a waitress here. She tears off a
text: check and places it in front of a super-muscular, polo shirted
text: EUROPEAN HIPSTER, who is too busy tapping away at his
text: POWERBOOK to notice.
text: She walks toward the end of the counter to total up her
text: receipts. She looks up and sees Enid, wearing tasteful 1930's
text: style clothes, sitting across from her.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize
dialog: you -- I think I need to get glasses;
dialog: you're all blurry!
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: (nodding toward
speaker_heading: muscular HIPSTER)
dialog: You're lucky then, you can't see the
text: veins on that guy's biceps.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Actually, he's a really nice guy.
dialog: We see at this point that Rebecca &amp; Enid are no longer
text: friends, but there are also no hard feelings evident.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Do you want anything?
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Maybe an orange juice.
text: Rebecca goes to get it. Enid looks around, bemused and
text: saddened by what The Quality Cafe has become.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hey, look what I got...
text: She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out
speaker_heading: her DIPLOMA.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Wow... finally.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: It just came yesterday...
text: Pause. Josh enters. Enid turns around.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Hi Enid.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Hey Josh.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Are you ready to go?
text: For a moment it's not clear who he's talking to, and then:
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (still counting
dialog: receipts)
dialog: Yeah, just one second...
text: She finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind
text: the counter. She kisses Josh perfunctorily.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (to Josh)
dialog: Did you remember to pay the phone
dialog: bill?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (to Enid)
dialog: Call me sometime.
speaker_heading: ENID
dialog: Definitely. We still have to go to
dialog: that shoe store sometime.
text: Rebecca &amp; Josh leave. Enid is totally alone in the now-alien
text: world of the Quality Cafe. A momentary pause as she calmly
text: stares into her orange juice. We see a small, round TRAVEL
text: BAG at her feet.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS/ACME SHOES - EVENING
text: We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.
text: It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises.
text: She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE. It
text: looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands
text: right in front of it. She looks through the partially papered
text: over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures:
text: a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a
text: FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC. A sign in the window reads: "Coming
text: Soon: Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - EVENING
text: She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm
text: stillness to the city. She turns a corner and is startled by
text: her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. She
text: stops and looks at herself. Everything about her looks perfect
text: for once; no need to change a thing. She moves closer to the
text: glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside.
text: She continues walking. Darkness is just setting in and she
text: has the street all to herself.
scene_heading: EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - NIGHT
text: We see Enid at NORMAN'S BUS STOP, sitting on the bench. She
text: looks at the apartment building across the street. A woman
text: who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV, bathing
text: her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT. The same thing
text: happens in another window down the street... then another...
text: Enid looks down the street. In the distance A BUS rounds the
text: corner and heads toward her.
text: From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus
text: as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view. A moment
text: later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. The CAMERA moves
text: upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the
dialog: credits roll.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING
text: The bus disappears over the crest of the bridge.
speaker_heading: THE END
