speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It's great that you
dialog: won the contest, Laura, but let's try not to brag about it.
dialog: (to Bob)
dialog: Nice one with the
dialog: lights, Bob!
speaker_heading: BOB, covered in
text: map, receives DAD's sincere compliment sarcastically (with a forced smile and
text: laugh). He then snaps angrily:
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: My pleasure. For the next song, maybe I can drive into
dialog: the river!
text: DAD startles at
dialog: BOB's aggression.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: (cheer, then singing)

dialog: Drive into the

scene_heading: EXTERIOR - NIGHT.
scene_heading: WINDING RURAL ROAD.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Oh... I'm Sorry.
dialog: We see DAD leaning
dialog: over attempting to help BOB. Map

scene_heading: NIGHT. VEGGIE VAN.
dialog: laura

dialog: Is there anything
dialog: you want me to tell Twippo, when I meet him?

dialog: Guitar gets stuck

dialog: Bob
dialog: Do you mind?
speaker_heading: DaD
dialog: I'm stuck. (Grunt)
dialog: Dad struggles to
text: free the guitar. He is excited when he finally pulls it free, but both Dad and
text: Bob are horrified as they realize that the steering wheel is pulled off, still
text: stuck to the guitar.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Aaaahhhh!
dialog: Bob
dialog: Get it on! Fix it!
dialog: Put it back!
dialog: 
dialog: Much chaos.
dialog: Van out of
dialog: control. We hear more yelling, guitar
text: boinging, etc.... In the foreground, a
text: family of porcupines - a momma and 2 kids, are crossing the road. The van is headed right at them! We cut to the momma porcupine's
text: reaction. She's shocked and terrified! She looks to her babies. Cute, innocent and unaware of the danger,
text: they look back at her with kinked heads and blink. Momma porcupine looks tenderly at her babies, then turns angrily
text: toward the approaching van.
text: Dramatically, she "winds-up".
speaker_heading: INTERIOR -
scene_heading: NIGHT. VEGGIE VAN.
dialog: We cut back to Bob
text: as the map falls below his eyes. He reacts in terror to what he then sees:
text: Momma porcupine has her quilled back toward the van with her head turned -
text: looking right at him. The babies stand innocently and blink.
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: PORCUPINE!
scene_heading: EXTERIOR - NIGHT.
scene_heading: WINDING RURAL ROAD.
dialog: Momma porcupine
text: then "pitches" a swarm of quills at the front tires. We follow the
text: flight of the quills on the "quill cam" as they punch into the
text: tires. We hear a couple of explosions
text: from the tires popping.
speaker_heading: INTERIOR -
scene_heading: NIGHT. VEGGIE VAN.
dialog: all
speaker_heading: AAAHH!
scene_heading: EXTERIOR - NIGHT.
scene_heading: WINDING RURAL ROAD.
dialog: The van performs
text: some donuts as it continues forward.
text: Much screams. Bob spins the
text: wheel wildly, trying to regain control of the van. The porcupines watch in interest as the "screaming" van
text: spins off the side of the road and heads down a steep wooded hill that leads to
text: a river! Bob steers wildly as the van
text: heads through some brush... the kids in the back scream in terror.
dialog: In rapid succession,
text: Bob must avoid a series of obstacles, which Dad calls out like a
text: highly-caffeinated sports announcer.
speaker_heading: daD
dialog: Tree!!!!
text: Bob swerves wildly
dialog: to miss a huge tree. Cut to kids in the
text: back, bouncing up and down and screaming as if they were riding bikes down a
dialog: flight of stairs.
dialog: dad (cont'd)
dialog: Cabin!!!!
text: Bob swerves wildly
text: to miss a small FISHERMAN'S CABIN. He
text: avoids the obstacle, but heads right toward the fisherman's CLOTHESLINE, a
text: sturdy, multi-line job strung with several items of clothing, most prominently,
text: a large pair of polka-dotted boxer
dialog: shorts.
speaker_heading: DAD (cont'd)
dialog: UNDERWEAR!!!!!!
dialog: Bob can't turn in
text: time, and the van heads right through the clothesline, with the boxer shorts
text: plastered across the windshield. The
text: kids startle and scream as if an alien had just landed on the windshield. Amazingly, the 5 nylon cords of the
text: clothesline hold tight, and slow the van to a stop like a small plane caught by
text: cartoon power lines. With visible and
text: audible tension, the stretched cords hold the van still at a 45 degree angle on
text: the side of the hill, no more than 20 feet from the river.
dialog: Kids
dialog: Aaaaaahhh!
speaker_heading: intERIOR van -nIGHT
text: All is still. Kids are silent, in shock. After a moment, Bob turns to look back and
dialog: says...
speaker_heading: boB
dialog: Heh, heh... Well
dialog: I'm glad that's over!
dialog: There is a loud
dialog: "poing!" SFX. Bob snaps to
dialog: Dad, who still hasn't moved.
dialog: bob (cont'd)
dialog: Did you say
dialog: something?
dialog: Another
dialog: "poing," and now we see what it is.
text: The nylon cords of the clothesline are snapping, one by one.
speaker_heading: BOB (cont'd)
dialog: (eyes widening)
dialog: Oh...
dialog: dad
dialog: (eyes widening)
dialog: ... dear...
dialog: Poing! Poing!
text: Poing! The last 3 cords snap in
text: rapid succession, and the van lurches toward the river. The kids' eyes widen and they all press back
text: against their seats in unison, and everyone screams like mad!
dialog: all
dialog: Aaaaaaaaah!!!!!!
dialog: eXT. hill -nIGHT
dialog: As the van rolls
text: perilously toward the river, a low-angle shot reveals a thick tree stump in its
text: path, about bumper-height, unnoticed by the van's occupants. As they scream and roll ahead, suddenly the
text: bumper meets the tree stump, and the van stops cold, no more than 6 feet from
dialog: the river
speaker_heading: intERIOR. vAN -
speaker_heading: nIGHT
dialog: The tree stump
text: stops the van cold, but also fires both front seat airbags, which inflate and
text: completely engulf Bob and Dad's faces.
text: The screaming dies out. Silence. The kids are afraid to blink. The airbags remain completely inflated,
text: engulfing Bob and Dad who stare into them motionless... wondering if they are
text: dead. After a pause, and not quite sure
dialog: what has happened, Bob speaks.
dialog: bob
dialog: (sfx - talking in balloon)
dialog: Am I in... heaven?
text: Beat. There is dust in the air from the airbags.
dialog: dad
dialog: (sniffs)
dialog: Smells like...
dialog: Wisconsin.
dialog: The kids finally
text: let their breath out, and fall back into their seats.
speaker_heading: KiDS
dialog: (exhale / sigh)
dialog: Phew!!!
speaker_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE
speaker_heading: -NIGHT
dialog: LS of the van at
text: the bank of the river. After a pause,
text: the sliding passenger side door opens and we see the veggie kids and dad
text: peeking out into the moonlit night.
text: Dust is settling. Bob pops
text: through the crowd, looks around and exits the van. He looks around a little more.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well. Nobody got hurt!
dialog: We hear the flying
text: quill SFX and a doink.
speaker_heading: BOB (cont'd)
speaker_heading: AAAAHHHH!
dialog: BOB looks over his
text: "shoulder" to find a small quill stuck in his behind. We hear high pitched laughing. Dad looks back up the hill and sees the
text: three porcupines standing where the van left the road. This time one of the babies has his back to
text: Bob - as if he were the one responsible for the "shot". His mother and sibling are laughing
text: approvingly.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Wow. What a shot!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (in pain)
speaker_heading: Hrrrgrrr.
speaker_heading: JR
dialog: Hey! What's that?
dialog: Everyone directs
text: their attention to that which Jr. has observed. It's an old rundown shack under a bridge along the bank of the
text: river. The lights from the building
text: glow eerily, dimly illuminating the surrounding landscape. A Red Neon sign reading "SEAFOO"
text: buzzes. There is a dock attached to the
text: restaurant to which are tied a couple decrepid rowboats and a larger
dialog: "pirate" type ship (see "The Pirates that Don't do Anything's"
text: ship). A fog rises from the river which
text: overflows onto the land. A FOG HORN
text: sounds and a SHIP BELL rings. An
text: occasional SEAGULL call fills the air.
dialog: Eerie. Cut back to our group's
dialog: reaction.
speaker_heading: ALL
speaker_heading: (except BOB,)
dialog: Oooooh.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What's
speaker_heading: "SEAFOO"?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: ... Maybe it's
dialog: like... tofu.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: ... Only saltier.
dialog: Cut back to the
text: restaurant. A "D" on the end
text: of the sign flickers a few times, revealing the real word, "SEAFOOD".
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: AAAhhhhh.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:Black
dialog: .
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
dialog: Interior - night. LOBBY of
dialog: Seafood restaurant
dialog: We hear Jr. teasing
text: Laura and Bob scolding Dad as our group comes through the front door of the
dialog: seafood restaurant. It's set up like a
text: typical Red Lobster with a hostess station and waiting area in the lobby,
text: bathrooms and telephones off to the side and a dining room beyond a clam and
text: lobster montage arch. Jean Claude and Phillipe Pea are the hosts and are
text: standing on the host podium. The walls
text: are filled with every imaginable sea creature - both stuffed and painted. Fishing nets hang. A picture of Ahab and Moby Dick adorns the walls, as well. The atmosphere is very mysterious and
dialog: "salty." The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything's theme in a
text: "moody/nautical" style is playing over the audio system. Dialogue is occurring simultaneously:

dialog: May we help you?
dialog: Our friends stop in

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The Asparagus
text: whacked me in the head with a guitar and our van got taken out by a mad
dialog: porcupine, then another one got me...
speaker_heading: BOB turns around

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Maybe it's because

dialog: Say... I need to call my wife... Do you have a phone?
speaker_heading: JR
dialog: Laura was teasing
dialog: me with her "special ticket," and then it flew right out the window
text: and she screamed and made the van crash..
dialog: Jr turns to Laura
speaker_heading: JR (cont'd)

speaker_heading: ANNIE waits for

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: JEAN CLAUDE and

speaker_heading: PHillipe
dialog: Down the hall,

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE hops off

text: PERCY looks on.
speaker_heading: PERCY

speaker_heading: JEAN CLAUDE and

text: DRUMS stop as abruptly as they started.
text: BOB, LAURA and JR look at each other, concerned. BOB returns a cautious nod.
speaker_heading: INTERIOR -
scene_heading: NIGHT. DINING ROOM OF SEAFOOD
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT
speaker_heading: BOB, LAURA and JR
text: hop toward their table. They are led by
text: JEAN CLAUDE (menus in hand) and followed by PHILLIPE. PHILLIPE takes note of the quill in BOB'S behind. THE PIRATES WHO DON'T DO ANYTHING theme
text: MUSIC plays over the sound system.
speaker_heading: PhILLIPE
dialog: Do you prefer
dialog: "poking" or "non-poking?"
speaker_heading: BOB returns an
text: annoyed, forced laugh to PHILLIP'S bad pun.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: heh heh heh... non.
speaker_heading: JEAN CLAUDE
dialog: Good one
dialog: Phillipe! You are one clever pea, no?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPE
dialog: (with his little French laugh)
dialog: Un huh huh!
speaker_heading: PHILLIPE
text: "yanks" the quill out. This
text: can be implied with a sound effect ("doink") and then showing
text: Phillipe holding the quill.
speaker_heading: BOB
speaker_heading: AAAH!
speaker_heading: PHILLIPE stops hopping
text: and stands there examining the quill as JEAN CLAUDE continues with the other
dialog: three.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPE
dialog: (looking at quill)
dialog: Whala! A skewer for zee scampi!
speaker_heading: PHILLIPE hops back
text: toward the kitchen, revealing (rack focus) three scraggly pirates in a
dialog: booth. It's "The Pirates Who Don't
text: Do Anything": Pa Grape, Mr. Lunt and Larry. They join into the intercom music lazily singing like old high
dialog: school football players reminiscing about their glory days:
speaker_heading: PIRATES
dialog: (Singing)
dialog: We are The Pirates
dialog: Who Don't Do Anything! We just stay
dialog: home and lie around! And if
dialog: you ask us to do anything,
dialog: We'll just tell
dialog: you...
dialog: We don't do
dialog: anything!
speaker_heading: Cut back to JEAN
text: CLAUDE, BOB, JR and LAURA as they reach their booth. Coincidently, it is right beside where the pirates are
text: sitting. The booths are divided by a
dialog: sheet of translucent Plexiglas. We hear
text: the light, lazy banter of the pirates (having finished their little chorus)
text: beyond the glass as background noise.
speaker_heading: JEAN CLAUDE
dialog: Please make
dialog: yourselves comfortable, I will be back to take your orders...
speaker_heading: JEAN CLAUDE places
text: menus on table and hops away.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Why don't you two
dialog: wait here. I'm gonna go call a tow
dialog: truck. Maybe we can still make it to
dialog: the concert on time.
text: BOB hops off.
speaker_heading: lAURA
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Yeah... everyone
dialog: but me...
speaker_heading: jR
dialog: Hey, it's your own
dialog: fault for teasing me! You're just
dialog: getting what you deserve!
dialog: LAURA is frustrated
text: and hurt. She looks to BOB hopping off.
text: Jr. smiles, self-righteously.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (frustrated noise)
dialog: Hrrrrrrrg... I'm coming
dialog: with you Mr. Bob...
speaker_heading: PIRATES
dialog: [add lib lazy
dialog: comments]
dialog: LAURA hops off
text: after BOB. JR remains at the table,
text: gloating in the "divine justice" of Laura's plight. He looks around the restaurant, taking in
text: the surroundings - which are slightly eerie once again. He can see the silhouettes of the pirates
text: through the Plexiglas. They continue
text: their banter. He realizes he is alone,
text: and feels a little frightened.
dialog: We return to JR. at
text: the table. He nervously looks around,
text: then spots the menu in front of him. He opens it up and starts to read. We scan it as he reads...
dialog: STEAK AND SHRIMP ... $10.00
speaker_heading: SCAMPI ON A
dialog: SKEWER ...
dialog: $7.50
speaker_heading: SCAMPI ON A
speaker_heading: CLEAN SKEWER ... $10.00
scene_heading: COMPASSION ... MARKET PRICE
dialog: This last item
text: seems odd to JR. He raises an eyebrow. We hear a SLIDING SFX.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Excuse me!
dialog: JR is taken by
text: surprise and startles. He drops his menu, revealing the pirates. They have slid back the translucent
text: Plexiglas from between the booths and now seem quite close. They're all staring at JR.
speaker_heading: JR
speaker_heading: AAAAAH!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: How's it goin?
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: Hey. What's up?
speaker_heading: JR
dialog: (still scared)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: PIRATES look around
dialog: and behind themselves.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Who us?
dialog: JR thought the
dialog: question was obvious.
speaker_heading: JR
dialog: ...Yeah...
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Oh!... We are...
dialog: "The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything!"...
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: Oh you know that's
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: Zilch.
speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: PA GRAPE

dialog: a little thing with your friend over there.
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: Yeah. You weren't being very nice...
speaker_heading: JR
dialog: Well, it's her own
dialog: fault! She was teasing me and now she's
dialog: getting what she deserves!
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Right.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Junior... we've
dialog: seen these types of situations before.
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: Happens all the
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: What you need is a
dialog: little compassion.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: ...And maybe some
dialog: scampi.
dialog: JR throws off
dialog: LARRY'S comment and comments to PA;
speaker_heading: JR
dialog: Hey... I saw that
dialog: in the menu... What is that? What's
dialog: compassion?
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: Ooh. That's a hard question.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Mmmm Hmmm.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Well... Compassion
dialog: is when ya see that someone needs help, and ya wanna help 'em!
text: JR looks confused.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: That's what I
dialog: thought you'd say.
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: They all do.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: We find it helpful
text: to illustrate with a little story.
dialog: JR seems
dialog: interested.
speaker_heading: JR
dialog: A story?
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Yep. You know, we call ourselves, "The
dialog: Pirates Who Don't Do Anything."
dialog: But that's not entirely accurate...
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: Yeah! Remember when we did that one thing... with
dialog: that one guy?
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Oh do I ever...

speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE

speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: Monday's good for

speaker_heading: pA narrator (V.O.)

dialog: So, what do we do
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: laRRY
dialog: Mmm - nothing.
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: You are a genius!
dialog: Pirates exit,
text: passing by booth where Man is buying fish from Ninevites. 2 Ninevites have a pile of old fish in front
text: of them. Flies buzz around the pile.
dialog: Man
dialog: Are these fish
dialog: fresh?
speaker_heading: jeAN CLAUDE
dialog: You bet!
speaker_heading: PhilLIPE
dialog: Oh, ya!
dialog: Man sniffs - fish
text: are obviously rotten. He nearly faints,
text: then turns and walks away indignantly.
dialog: Man
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: jeAN CLAUDE
dialog: What?!? They were
dialog: fresh when we caught them...
speaker_heading: PhILLIPE

dialog: Mm. Ninevites.
speaker_heading: pa narrator (VO)
dialog: Beside the fact
dialog: that we were low on funds, this was a memorable day because he showed
dialog: up!
dialog: Larry and others
text: turn to look at a tall figure entering the market. It is JONAH (Archibald Asparagus), riding very regally on his camel REGINALD. As Pa speaks, we watch Jonah ride into the
text: market as well as the reactions of the crowd to the presence of a prophet. (SCORE - Theme 2B-271.)
dialog: pa narrator (cont'd)
dialog: Jonah!
dialog: (musical sting)
dialog: Now Jonah was a
dialog: prophet of God - which means he was one of the very special people God used to
dialog: deliver messages to Israel. He was kind
dialog: of like a mailman, except his letters came straight from God!!
dialog: (Pa gets a little too excited on that line.)
dialog: Ahem. Anyway...
dialog: Jonah loved helping his friends by bringing them God's messages. Sometimes the
dialog: messages were good, sometimes they were not so good. But when a prophet talked, everybody listened!
speaker_heading: nEZZER
dialog: (yelling out)
dialog: What's the word,
dialog: Jonah?
dialog: townspeople
dialog: (various)
dialog: (What's the
dialog: word? Yeah, what's the word?)
dialog: Jonah looks around
text: smartly, then pulls up his camel.
dialog: jonah
dialog: Stop right here,
dialog: Reginald.
dialog: Reginald
speaker_heading: Rpbbpbpbf!
dialog: Reginald snuffles
text: and pulls up short. From his demeanor,
text: it is obvious that he too, is British.
text: Jonah glances around for a moment, then speaks. Music starts.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: Dear people, I
dialog: bring you a message from the Lord!
dialog: The crowd catches
text: their breath and stiffens, fearing the worst.
dialog: Crowd

dialog: everyone! Thank you very much!
speaker_heading: pa nARRATOR (vo)
dialog: That was pretty
dialog: much Jonah's life! Town to town... bringing God's messages to his friends...
dialog: not a bad gig, overall!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: diSSOLVE TO:
text: ext - night. outside jonah's tent.
dialog: Small, colorful
text: tent set up on the edge of town. (Big
dialog: enough to stand up in, but wouldn't hold more than 3 or 4 people.) Oil lamp is primary source of light, hanging
text: near tent's small window.
speaker_heading: disSOLVE TO:
text: int - night. inside jonah's tent.
dialog: Jonah is ready for
text: bed, praying. Either seated or
dialog: standing, depending on acting logistics.
text: There is a map of Israel on the wall, painted on a large piece of
text: papyrus. The map extends just enough to
text: show Nineveh in the far upper right corner.
speaker_heading: pa nARRATOR
dialog: So, every night
dialog: before he went to sleep, Jonah would pray and ask God if there was a new
dialog: message for him to deliver. And this
dialog: night, there was a message that would change Jonah's life!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: jonAH
dialog: (eyes closed - 'conversing' with God)
dialog: A new message...
dialog: yes... what's that? People being
dialog: unkind? Lying? Stealing?
dialog: Oh, dear! Sounds like a standard
dialog: "turn and repent" to me.
dialog: Alright... name the town! I'll
dialog: be on my way first thing in the morning!
dialog: Where is it? Jericho? Damascus?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What? Nineveh?
dialog: Jonah opens his
text: eyes and scans his map.
speaker_heading: joNAH (cont'd)
dialog: (confused)
dialog: I'm not aware of
dialog: any Nineveh's in Israel... no, I don't think...
dialog: (pause - eyes widen)
dialog: Oh... you mean that
dialog: Nineveh?
speaker_heading: PA NARRATOR
dialog: (Pan and zoom across map to Nineveh.)
dialog: That Nineveh wasn't in Israel at all! It was the capital of Assyria and it was the
dialog: biggest, meanest city around!
dialog: (Show dark, scary city)
dialog: Now, the people of
dialog: Nineveh were particularly mean to Jonah's people - the Israelites. They lied!
dialog: They stole! But worst of all,
dialog: they slapped people with fishes!
dialog: (Show Ninevites doing the above to several Israelites)
dialog: Ninevite pea
dialog: Yes!!
speaker_heading: PA NARRATOR
dialog: They even slapped
dialog: each other with fishes! They didn't
dialog: know the difference between right and wrong.
dialog: The Ninevites were so mean, in fact, that most Israelites - including
dialog: Jonah - wished God would just wipe Nineveh off the face of the Earth!
dialog: (Show fire from heaven consuming Nineveh - comically)
dialog: Ninevite pea
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Pa Narrator
dialog: Needless to say, Jonah was shocked that God
dialog: would want him to deliver a message to his enemies
dialog: Back to Jonah.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (confused)
dialog: You - you don't
dialog: want me to go there.... You don't know
dialog: what Nineveh is like! Perhaps you've
dialog: never been there... Well, of course, you haven't! A god like you would never go to a place like Nineveh! For that matter, either would a prophet like
dialog: me! Ha ha..
dialog: (nervous laugh - then singing )
dialog: No, it cannot
dialog: be...
dialog: Your messages
dialog: are meant for me... and my brothers.
dialog: We are you're
dialog: chosen people - and Nineveh... well, they're not!
dialog: 
dialog: There must be
dialog: some mistake - a big misunderstanding.
dialog: It's really hard
dialog: to take - how could you be so demanding?
dialog: 
dialog: For years I've
dialog: been your messenger from Moresheth to Gath.
dialog: But Nineveh
dialog: should get no chance to turn - they've earned your wrath!
dialog: 
dialog: No, it cannot
dialog: be...
dialog: Your messages
dialog: are meant for me... and my brothers.
dialog: We are you're
dialog: chosen people - and Nineveh... well, they're not!
dialog: 
dialog: (speaking)
dialog: We're the good
dialog: guys... they're the bad guys! Please,
dialog: don't send me there with a message of your mercy!
dialog:

dialog: Any town in

dialog: 
dialog: Shiloh, Gilgal,
dialog: Jericho - just say the word!
dialog: But Nineveh -
dialog: that is just absurd!
dialog: Joppa, Aphek,
dialog: Jezreel - they're all just fine -
dialog: But Nineveh...
dialog: (thoughtful)
dialog: oh, Nineveh...
dialog: (resolute)
dialog: No! Nineveh is where I draw the line!
text: Jonah rips off
text: section of map containing Nineveh on closing beat, cutting a clear line across
dialog: map.
dialog: cut TO:
text: ext - night. Jonah's tent. near ground angle.
dialog: Glow in tent window
text: is the only warm tone in an otherwise blue night scene. He's the only one awake in town. Jonah flings the crumpled up piece of map
text: out the window. It bounces up near the
dialog: camera.
dialog: cut TO:
dialog: int - Jonah's tent.
dialog: Jonah lies back on
text: his mat, staring up thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: jonAH
dialog: (singing)
dialog: No, it cannot
dialog: be...
dialog: Your messages
dialog: are meant for me.
dialog: 
text: He turns away from
text: the camera and the wind picks up,
text: blowing out his small OIL LAMP.
dialog: cut to black.
dialog: int - night. seafood restaurant
dialog: Besides Junior, a
text: few more people have gathered around to hear the story, Laura included. They are entranced.
dialog: Laura is now
text: sitting beside Junior, listening.
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE
dialog: Yup. It sounded like God wanted to offer mercy to
dialog: Jonah's enemies.
dialog: Bob returns,
text: sliding into the booth, oblivious to the story.
dialog: bob
dialog: The tow truck's on
dialog: it's way. Ya know, Junior, I love your
dialog: dad and all, but that's the last time I pick him for a copilot
dialog: Bob notices the
dialog: pirates staring.
speaker_heading: bOB (cont'd)
dialog: Uh... what's going
dialog: on?
text: Lunt slurps on his
text: straw. Pa stares at him for a beat.
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE
dialog: Ahem... We're
dialog: telling a little story. You should
dialog: listen, too.
text: Bob glances around,
text: then nods and smiles feebly.
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: As I was saying, it
dialog: sounded like God wanted to offer mercy to the Ninevites.
dialog: laura
dialog: What's 'mercy'?
dialog: lunt
dialog: It's what this
dialog: whole story is about!
dialog: junior
dialog: I thought it was
dialog: about compassion... remember? The menu?
dialog: Mr. Lunt looks a
dialog: little embarrassed.
dialog: lunt
dialog: Uh, yeah. There's that, too.
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE
dialog: Better check your
dialog: menu again - we got TWO specials today... and they go hand in hand!
dialog: Junior picks up his
text: menu, just in time to see "MERCY..... MARKET PRICE" fade in right
dialog: beneath compassion.
dialog: larry
dialog: Compassion is when
dialog: you want to help someone who needs help.
dialog: Mercy is when you give someone a second chance... even if they don't
dialog: deserve it! This story is about both of
dialog: them!
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: That's right, my
dialog: cucumber friend. Ya can't have mercy
dialog: without compassion... but mercy is even more important! Jonah was afraid God was going to give
dialog: Nineveh a second chance - that he was going to help them even though they
dialog: didn't deserve it!
dialog: laura
dialog: So what did he do?
speaker_heading: dissOLVE TO:
dialog: ext - day. outside
dialog: jonah's tent.
speaker_heading: pa nARRATOR
dialog: Well, never before
dialog: had he gotten a message from God that he didn't want to deliver! He didn't know what to do!
dialog: Jonah backs out of
text: tent, shutting the flap behind him. No
text: sooner does he turn around, than he is greeted warmly by townspeople.
dialog: jerry
dialog: Good morning,
dialog: Jonah! What's the word?
dialog: Jonah starts to
dialog: panic.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: What? Nothing!
dialog: There is no word!
dialog: jerry
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Nothing at all?
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: No!! Nothing at all! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm very busy!
dialog: Jonah hurries off,
text: only to be greeted by another townsperson.
speaker_heading: neZZER
dialog: Good morning
dialog: Jonah! What's the word?
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (very panicky)
dialog: Stop it!! There is no word!! Nothing!!
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I've got to get out
dialog: of here!
dialog: Jonah starts to
text: run. Nezzer looks after, confused.
speaker_heading: joNAH (cont'd)
dialog: (running, looking over shoulders to make sure no one's following)
dialog: There is no
dialog: word... I have no new messages!!
dialog: And above all, I am
dialog: not... going... to... Nineveh!!
dialog: Jonah runs face
text: first into giant map of middle east, posted next to a merchant's booth advertising
dialog: cruise tickets.
dialog: cut TO:
dialog: ext - day.
dialog: dockside.
dialog: The merchant is
text: SCOOTER. He has a small booth right at
text: the edge of the dock. He sells tickets
dialog: for cruises out of this small port.
text: There are several ships docked behind him, one of which belongs to the Pirates.
dialog: scooter
dialog: Sorry, sir! I can't sell ya a ticket to Nineveh!
speaker_heading: jonAH
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?!? Who are you?!?
dialog: scooter
dialog: The name's
dialog: Angus. I sell cruise tickets! There's nothing like a cruise on the Great
dialog: Sea ta clean the sand outa yer wicket, aye?
dialog: But ya can't sail ta Nineveh!
dialog: It's landlocked! See?
dialog: (gestures with a loud 'thwack!' to map with pointer)
dialog: Ya can't go by
dialog: sea... ya gotta go by land!
speaker_heading: jonAH
dialog: (still confused)
dialog: But I don't want to
dialog: go to-
dialog: Jonah is
text: interrupted by passing townspeople
speaker_heading: wOMAN #1
dialog: Oh, hello Mr.
dialog: Jonah! What's the word?
speaker_heading: sCOOTER
dialog: Ah! He's goin' ta Nineveh!!
speaker_heading: wOMAN #1
dialog: Oh, really?
speaker_heading: jonAH
dialog: (erupts)
dialog: I am not
dialog: going to Nineveh! Why on Earth would I
dialog: want to go to Nineveh?!? In fact, I'm
dialog: going in the opposite direction!
dialog: (looks to map)
dialog: What's the furthest
dialog: thing in the world from Nineveh?
speaker_heading: SCOOTER
dialog: Well if you have a
dialog: few days, you could sail down to Egypt... it's lovely this time of year...
dialog: Something on the
text: map has caught Jonah's eye. He isn't
dialog: listening.
speaker_heading: jonAH
dialog: There! I want to go there!
dialog: Camera follows
text: Jonah's gaze to the far end of the map - to an area called
dialog: "Tarshish."
speaker_heading: SCOOTER
dialog: Wha-? Tarshish?
dialog: Why, that would take weeks! It's
dialog: the other end of the world!!
speaker_heading: jonAH
dialog: Perfect! How much?
speaker_heading: SCOOTER
dialog: Even if you had the
dialog: money, no one around here has the time to sail all the way to Tarshish...
dialog: Scooter notices one
text: of the Pirates lounging above deck in a recliner, listening to their theme song
text: on a cheap, AM radio.
speaker_heading: scoOTER (cont'd)
dialog: Then again...
dialog: Jonah notices Pirates
dialog: as well.
dialog: cut TO:
dialog: ext - day. Pirate ship - above deck.
dialog: All 3 Pirates are
dialog: lined up, explaining why they can't possibly sail to Tarshish.
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: We couldn't
dialog: possibly... we're very busy with... cargo... and stuff...
dialog: lunt
dialog: You know, Pirates
dialog: have to pillage and plunder and... uh, that really takes it out of you...
dialog: larry
dialog: ... and Alf is on
dialog: in a half-hour so I don't think we should... uh...
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE
dialog: ... and besides
dialog: that, we don't really sail.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: At all.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So the answer is
dialog: 'no.'
speaker_heading: jonAH
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Money is no object.
dialog: Pregnant
text: pause. The Pirates are motionless. Then Pa Grape breaks the silence.
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE
dialog: Next stop,
dialog: Tarshish! I'll hoist the mainsail!
dialog: larry
dialog: I'll pop the
dialog: popcorn!
speaker_heading: lunT
dialog: I'll get the moist
dialog: towelettes! Where did we put them? Hey, Larry, have you seen the towelettes?
speaker_heading: LarrY
dialog: I got it! I got it!
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: No, those are baby
dialog: wipes. They'll dry your skin out.
dialog: Pirates scurry
dialog: around like crazy, imagining all the cheese curls their newfound wealth will
text: buy. Jonah smiles - relieved - but then
text: looks a bit concerned as he realizes he is now 'officially' running away from
dialog: God.
dialog: The Pirates prattle
text: on as their ship moves away from the dock under full sail. Sailing erratically, they careen into the
text: ship next to them as they head toward the open sea.
dialog: pa grape (os)
dialog: Sorry! My fault!!
speaker_heading: Pa NARRATOR
dialog: Even though we'd
dialog: never sailed before, we took to it like a fish to water!
dialog: Cut to Larry
text: standing dramatically in the crow's nest, spyglass to his eye. He scans the sea
text: aggressively. He spots something.
speaker_heading: LarrY
dialog: Thar she blows!
dialog: Cut to Lunt,
text: staring up at him from the deck
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: LarrY
dialog: (looking down at the deck)
dialog: Right there! Next
dialog: to the grill!
dialog: We cut to Larry's
text: POV through the telescope to show a ping-pong ball on the deck of the ship next
text: to the BBQ grill. Lunt moves into shot. Cut to Lunt on deck.
speaker_heading: LUNT
dialog: Got it!
dialog: Lunt takes the ball
text: to the pint pong table. Pa is standing on the top of one side of the table with
text: paddle. Jonah stands behind the opposite side, holding paddle lethargically.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: 6-0!
dialog: Pa serves the ball.
text: It bounces right past Jonah, who makes no attempt to hit it. He's too depressed
text: to try. He watches it bounce off the table and over toward the grill.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: 7-0! That's a
dialog: skunk! I win!
dialog: Jonah looks on
text: dryly. Lunt and Larry cheer.
dialog: Lunt and Larry
dialog: Yeah! Yippee
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: Whadaya say, Jonah?
dialog: 2 out of 3?
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Ahh... No. I'm
dialog: done.
dialog: Jonah turns and
text: listlessly walks away from the table.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Argh! When we get
dialog: to Tarshish, Ho-ho's! On me!
speaker_heading: LuNT AND LARRY
dialog: Yeah! Yippee
dialog: (cheering in unison!)
dialog: We winny at the
dialog: ping pong!
dialog: We get the ho-ho
dialog: and the ding dong!
dialog: Ding-dong!
dialog: Cut to shot from
text: the bulkhead ad Jonah listlessly walks toward stairs to go below deck.
speaker_heading: pa nARRATOR
dialog: Once we finally got
dialog: out to sea, Jonah went below deck to rest a bit.
dialog: cut TO:
text: int - day. SHIP'S HOLD.
dialog: Typical ship's
text: hold. Dark and musty. Bags of grape leaves on floor, barrels of
text: who-knows-what, etc. Two bunks hang off
text: one wall - one over the other. Light
text: comes from several oil lanterns, plus some natural light down ladder from above
text: deck and through cracks in planking above.
text: Jonah enters and looks around.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (a little depressed)
dialog: Oh, what have I
dialog: done? What have I done?
dialog: Jonah grabs bag of
text: grape leaves and tosses it on bunk to use as a pillow. He drops onto the bunk on his back, with his
text: head on the bag, unaware that there is a large worm in the bag he has chosen.
dialog: tape
dialog: (from bag)
dialog: You are powerful
dialog: and attractive.
dialog: jonah
dialog: (glances around nervously)
dialog: What? Who's there?
speaker_heading: TAPE
dialog: You do not run from
dialog: your problems, but confront them face-to-face.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (jumping up)
dialog: Ah!! The bag! It speaks!
dialog: Throws bag against
dialog: opposite wall.
dialog: Khalil
dialog: (from pillow)
dialog: Ow! What did you do that for?
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: Mr. Twisty? ...
dialog: Who's there? Show yourself!
text: Worm crawls up on
text: barrel or something. He is holding
text: headphones, which he places back in the bag of leaves. Jonah has never seen a
dialog: worm exactly like this one.
dialog: Khalil
dialog: Hello!
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: What are you?
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: Who, me?... Oh, my
dialog: name is Khalil. I am a
dialog: caterpillar. Well, that's only half
dialog: true. My mother was a caterpillar. My father was a worm. But I'm okay with that now.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (can't pronounce)
dialog: Khalil?
dialog: khalil
dialog: Khalil. You've got to get your gut into it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I bet you're
dialog: wondering why I'm here.
dialog: jonah
dialog: (not really interested)
dialog: Aaah... you... tidy
dialog: up around the ship?
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: Oh, no - I do not
dialog: work on the ship.
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: I am a small
dialog: business operator! A traveling
dialog: salesman! I sell Persian rugs door to
dialog: door! See?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (still not interested)
dialog: Oh - lovely. A-
dialog: Jonah opens his
text: mouth to speak, but Khalil cuts him off.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: By the way, do you
dialog: know where this ship is going?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Yes, Tarshish.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: (eyes widen)
dialog: Tarshish! What a trip!
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: You know, that may
dialog: be just what I need! The Persian rug
dialog: business has not been going very well around here...
dialog: (brightens)
dialog: But I still have a
dialog: positive mental attitude... because of my motivational tapes!
dialog: Pulls headphones
text: out of bag of leaves - tape is still playing.
text: Jonah looks on curiously.
dialog: tape
dialog: You are a skilled
dialog: metalworker.
text: Khalil smiles big.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: I am a skilled
dialog: metalworker!
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I did not know
dialog: that!
dialog: Jonah stares,
text: perplexed. Khalil puts headphones back
text: in back - clicks off tape. Jonah turns
text: to straighten his bunk.
speaker_heading: jONAH
dialog: Yes... well, that's
dialog: lovely, Carlyle, but if you don't mind, I think I'll just get some rest...
dialog: Khalil is staring
text: intently at Jonah's profile. It looks
text: very familiar. Suddenly, he realizes
text: who he's looking at.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Jonah!?!
text: Jonah startles.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Huh - ?
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: You're Jonah!!
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: You know me?
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: Of course I
dialog: do! You are the most famous prophet in
dialog: the whole world!!
dialog: Jonah is flattered,
text: tries to hide a smile.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Well, I don't know
dialog: if I'd say -
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: I sell your
dialog: licensed merchandise! Look! I have the Jonah rugs...
dialog: Pulls out Persian
text: rug with Jonah's profile on it.
speaker_heading: khaLIL (CONT'D)
dialog: ... the Jonah plush
dialog: toy...
dialog: Pulls out tiny
dialog: plush Jonah.
speaker_heading: KHALIL (CONT'D)
dialog: ... with sound
dialog: chip!
dialog: Khalil gives the
text: Jonah doll a few whacks to the belly.
dialog: plush toy
dialog: (tinny - sound chip style)
dialog: A message from the
dialog: Lord!
dialog: (whack)
dialog: A message from the
dialog: Lord!
speaker_heading: jONAH
dialog: Well, I'm...
dialog: flattered...
speaker_heading: khALIL
dialog: You are huge!! You are a celebrity!!
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (modestly)
dialog: Well... I...
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: From town to town -
dialog: delivering God's messages! What a
dialog: life! You are a big shot!!
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (still hiding a smile)
dialog: Oh, no... it's
dialog: really...
speaker_heading: kHALIL
dialog: (not slowing down a bit)
dialog: The man God can
dialog: count on to deliver his messages!
dialog: This line nicks Jonah,
text: and his fake modesty starts to fade.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (deflating)
dialog: Yes... well...
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: You and God are
text: like peas in a pod! Like two humps on a
dialog: camel - you always 'sway the same way!'
text: Jonah is wilting.
speaker_heading: kHALIL (CONT'D)
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Oh, that's a good
dialog: one! You know, humor runs very deep in
dialog: my family! My uncle was a big star
dialog: back at a comedy club in Nineveh... the Taj Ma-Haha... Standing room only!
dialog: (grows sober)
dialog: Then he was hit
dialog: with a fish. I'm telling you, those
dialog: people don't know right from wrong.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: Oh, Nineveh.
dialog: Khalil
dialog: Hmm? You are sad now, my friend? Something about Nineveh makes you feel sad
dialog: inside?
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: I don't really want
dialog: to talk about it... I just need some rest...
dialog: Khalil
dialog: Oh, you do not have
dialog: to tell me.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: Good.
dialog: Khalil
dialog: Because I already
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (startles)
dialog: You do?
dialog: Khalil
dialog: Oh, yes. There is a woman in Nineveh, is there
dialog: not? A beautiful young asparagus! She is waiting there for you, no?
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: Um, no.
dialog: Khalil
dialog: (keeps right on going)
dialog: You were promised
dialog: to be married - but your job is now in the way. The woman's father is the head of an international ring of camel
dialog: thieves! This very day you set sail for
dialog: Tarshish to deliver a message that will break the back of the camel thieves -
dialog: but in the process will break the heart of the woman you love!
dialog: Jonah stares -
dialog: unable to speak.
speaker_heading: Khalil (CONT'D)
dialog: Insight runs very
dialog: deep in my family. Do not worry, the
dialog: first one is free.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (beyond desperate)
dialog: Please, Carlyle...
dialog: I just need to get some rest...
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: It's Khalil. But you can call me Carlyle if you want
dialog: to! When we get to Tarshish, you can
dialog: deliver the message, and I'll sell the plush toys! We can be a team!
dialog: Jonah stares at the
text: wall and groans.
dialog: Toy
dialog: A message from...
dialog: the Lord!
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Ugh...
speaker_heading: kHALIL
dialog: Well, sweet dreams
dialog: travelling buddy! We can make our plans
dialog: to save those camels tomorrow!
dialog: Clearly depressed,
text: Jonah closes his eyes. We hear the
text: "click" of Khalil's tape recorder, as the motivational tape starts
text: back up. The look on Jonah's face
text: contrasts with the line from the tape.
speaker_heading: tAPE
dialog: You are a
dialog: go-getter.
speaker_heading: fade tO bLACK.
dialog: 
dialog: int - dream
text: sequence. Cut to white limbo.
dialog: Jonah over white
dialog: limbo background. Jonah is
text: walking. Passes Scooter, dressed as
dialog: ticket merchant. Everything is
dialog: mysterious.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: Yes - which way is
dialog: Tarshish?
speaker_heading: sCOOTER
dialog: (kind of trance-like)
dialog: Right this way...
dialog: ya can't miss it!
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: Thank you!
dialog: Jonah continues -
text: relieved to be heading for Tarshish.
dialog: Suddenly God's voice
text: interrupts, which sounds suspiciously like Pa Grape.
dialog: god
dialog: Jonah...
dialog: Jonah is surprised
dialog: - looks around for source.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: What? Who is it?
dialog: god
dialog: Jonah... Where are
dialog: you going?
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: Oh! It's you, Lord.
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Um - I'm going
dialog: to... I'm going...
dialog: god
dialog: Jonah!
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: I'm sorry, I can't
dialog: hear you!
dialog: Jonah starts to
dialog: walk very quickly.
dialog: god
dialog: Jonah!
dialog: Jonah starts to
dialog: run.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: I can't hear
dialog: you! Lalalalalalala...!
dialog: god
dialog: Jonah!
dialog: Suddenly, running
text: becomes difficult. Jonah looks down and
text: sees that he is now running in water, and the water seems to be rising.
speaker_heading: joNAH (o.S.)
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: I... can't...
dialog: hear... you!
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE (o.S.)
dialog: Jonah!
dialog: Water splashes
text: Jonah's face as he tries vainly to run against the rising tide.
dialog: dissolve TO:
dialog: int - day. Ship's hold.
dialog: Dream transition
text: back to Jonah, tossing in his bunk. The
text: hold of the ship is flooding and water is splashing Jonah's face. Pa Grape is trying to wake him.
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE
dialog: Jonah! Jonah! Jonah!
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (eyes closed)
dialog: No! I- I can't hear you!
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE
dialog: Come on, wake
dialog: up! We got trouble!
dialog: Jonah finally opens
text: his eyes and sees his surroundings.
text: Water sloshes around the hold as the ship is rocked by an immense storm.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: What?
dialog: (notices situation)
dialog: What's happening?!?
speaker_heading: PA
speaker_heading: GRAPE
dialog: We're in a
dialog: storm! Like I've never seen
dialog: before! If we don't do something quick,
dialog: we're gonna sink!!
dialog: We cut to the WORM
text: with his mouth stuffed with grape leafs, bobbing around in a small pot while
text: munching away and licking his fingers.
dialog: Khalil
dialog: (speaking with his mouth full)
dialog: We seem to have
dialog: sprung a leak, traveling buddy!
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE spots the
dialog: worm and becomes angry.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Huh?... Hey! What are you doin' here?
speaker_heading: The WORM looks
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: Didn't I tell you
dialog: to get off my ship, ya lousy leaf eater?
speaker_heading: The WORM nods
text: timidly in affirmation.
dialog: Khalil
dialog: Well, yes... but
dialog: you see, my new friend and I are going to Tarshish to break the back of the
dialog: camel thieves!!
dialog: Pa glances
text: curiously at Jonah, who gives him an "it's a long story" look.
speaker_heading: Khalil (cONT'D)
dialog: Crime-fighting runs
dialog: very deep in my family!
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: ... Why if it
dialog: wasn't for this storm I'd make ya walk the plank!
dialog: (turning his attention to Jonah)
dialog: And you! How can
dialog: you sleep at a time like this?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: I'll tell you
dialog: what's going on! We're all gonna be
dialog: fish food if I don't get some help!
speaker_heading: JONAH and the WORM
dialog: startle.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (panic)
dialog: Well - what can we
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Get up and pray to
dialog: your god! Maybe he'll have mercy on us and spare our lives! ... Oy!
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE turns to
dialog: go above deck.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: Somebody "up
dialog: there" must be really upset with somebody "down here!"
speaker_heading: JONAH looks
text: nervous, the WORM looks at JONAH. PA GRAPE then turns back and brightens, just
dialog: having had a realization.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: ...Wait a minute!
dialog: That's it!... Alright you two, follow me!
speaker_heading: The WORM and JONAH
text: look curiously at each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXTERIOR -
scene_heading: DAY. PIRATE SHIP AT SEA
speaker_heading: LARRY and MR LUNT
text: are on deck at a small folding table, playing go fish with a deck of fish
dialog: cards. MR LUNT has a big
dialog: "handful" of cards. LARRY is
text: holding only one card and has his "suits" laid out neatly in front of
text: him. The ship is rocking violently and
text: the two pirates and their table slide up and down the deck as they play.
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: You got electric
dialog: eel?
dialog: Larry
dialog: Nope. Go Fish...
dialog: (tauntingly)
dialog: ...one more
dialog: card....
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: You are one
dialog: cheatin' buccaneer.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: How'm I supposed to
dialog: cheat at "go fish?"
speaker_heading: MR LUNT thinks
dialog: about the question.
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: Uhhh... I don't know...
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: (Off-screen)
dialog: Alright ya Lazy's!
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE, JONAH and
text: the WORM approach.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: Game over! Shuffle 'em up and deal us in!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: ...but...
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: (Mockingly)
dialog: Hee Hee.
dialog: The other three
text: gather around the table. MR LUNT
text: gathers the cards and "shuffles" them. PA GRAPE lays the ground rules... We cut between character's reactions as he speaks.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Okay! Here's the
dialog: deal. The way I see it, there is a
dialog: reason for this storm. Somebody
dialog: "up there" is really upset with somebody "down here." And
dialog: it's not gonna let up until we know who that "somebody" is. It could be any one of us...
speaker_heading: MR LUNT deals the
dialog: cards.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: ...I have my
dialog: suspicions...
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE turns
text: sharply toward the WORM, who reacts in terror.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: But we won't know
dialog: for sure until we figure it out scientifically.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE looks at
dialog: each other suspiciously.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: All right men -- Go
dialog: fish!... looser takes a swim!
speaker_heading: LIGHTNING
text: flashes. EVERYONE startles.
dialog: We montage through
text: an intense game of "go fish" as the storm continues to rage. We dissolve between different types of fish
text: cards being flipped up, passed around, and set down on the table. We see
text: character's faces as the game progresses - if they're holding a lot of cards,
text: they look nervous, if not, they're relaxed. MR LUNT appears to be losing at one
text: point, then the game shifts and the WORM is on the loosing end. We cut away to a wide shot of the pirate
text: ship and see it being tossed around by the waves. The worm starts to make a comeback. We hear reverby "go fishes" and various
text: "aarghs" and "uh-ohs" throughout the game . Finally, only the WORM and JONAH are left
dialog: with cards. They both look very
text: nervous. MUSIC stops. The WORM asks timidly;
speaker_heading: KhaLIL
dialog: ...You got any...
dialog: trout?
speaker_heading: JONAH'S face
text: drops. He slides the WORM a card. The WORM picks the card up, then slowly lays
dialog: down his last four cards face up - four
text: whales! The WORM is out. JONAH is the
text: loser. All eyes turn toward JONAH. PA GRAPE is confused.
speaker_heading: KhaLIL (cONT'D)
dialog: Hmmm? What a goose I am! It's a match! I had it
dialog: all along!
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Huh??!! I thought for sure...
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Alright! I admit
dialog: it. It's my fault! All my fault! I'm the one to blame!
dialog: Khalil looks at
dialog: Jonah, confused.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: But... I... the
dialog: worm...
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (cutting PA off)
dialog: I am a Hebrew, and
dialog: I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the land. And I'm
dialog: running away from Him! He told me to go to Nineveh, but I didn't listen! You
dialog: know, I don't like those people...
dialog: Mr. Lunt
dialog: (chiming in)
dialog: Oooh. Fish
dialog: slappers.
dialog: Cut back to Khalil,
text: shaking his head in disbelief.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Yes... so I ran.
dialog: I ran and I ended up here and now everyone's in terrible danger all
dialog: because of me. I'm afraid the only thing left is to be thrown into the sea!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Awww... you don't
dialog: have to do that... we gotta plank. You
dialog: can just walk off...
speaker_heading: JONAH, thinking
text: himself noble for the offer, is a little surprised by LARRY'S comment and
dialog: comments dryly...
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: ...Yes... thank
dialog: you. You're too kind.
speaker_heading: LARRY smiles at the
dialog: compliment.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Well Jonah, ol'
dialog: buddy. It was nice knowin' ya... Normally you'd be entitled to a refund, but
dialog: under the circumstances - you know, with you dyin' and all ...
speaker_heading: JONAH is again
text: underwhelmed by his hosts' benevolence.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: ...
dialog: No... I don't suppose a refund would do me much good now, would it?...
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Ah, thanks! You're a trooper.
speaker_heading: (to LARRY)
dialog: Ain't he a trooper?
speaker_heading: LARRY nods and
text: smiles in agreement. JONAH looks down
text: and catches Khalil's eye.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: But... the
dialog: camels...
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (looks down)
dialog: Oh...
dialog: Jonah shakes his
text: head sadly, then looks pitifully toward the sea.
speaker_heading: Suddenly, MR LUNT
text: brightens up, then chimes in...
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: Hey! Wait a minute!
dialog: I just remembered something! Maybe you don't have to walk the plank, after all!
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Huh?!!
dialog: Exterior -
text: day. REAR OF Pirate ship at sea
dialog: Our friends have
text: all gathered around a big lump covered with a tarp at the back of the
text: ship. The storm continues to rage.
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: Every winter, my
dialog: cousin from Moose Lake asks me to take care of this...
text: MR LUNT peels off
text: the tarp revealing a large gas powered outboard dual propeller boat motor.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Oooooh.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: This my friends, is
text: a Jupiter 1600 horsepower, high-octane, dual propeller, pull ignition, outboard
text: motor... with the optional chrome trim package.
dialog: The chrome
text: shimmers.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: (in the same tone)
dialog: Oooooh.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (in the same tone)
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: (in the same tone)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: It gets us back to
dialog: Joppa.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Well... How does it
dialog: work?
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: That I don't know.
dialog: Everyone stands
text: there and stares at the engine. The
text: WORM then speaks up.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: Perhaps I could
dialog: help.
dialog: (to Jonah)
dialog: You know, technical
dialog: competency runs -
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I know, very deep
dialog: in your family.
dialog: The worm is
dialog: surprised.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: Oh! Our reputation precedes us! Well then... it appears that one should pull
dialog: the cord and then perhaps push this black bubbly thingy...
dialog: Everyone thinks
dialog: that's as good of an idea as any other. They all ignorantly nod in
dialog: agreement. The WORM does just
dialog: that. He pulls the cord a couple of
text: times and the engine turns over but does not start. He then squeezes the fuel line bubble a couple of times. Nothing happens. Everyone looks at the WORM, who becomes a little nervous that his
dialog: plan did not work. He revises it:
speaker_heading: KHALIL (cONT'D)
dialog: Oh.. no... Maybe
dialog: it's the other way around. Perhaps if
text: one first pushes the black bubbly thingy and then pulls the cord...
dialog: Everyone again
text: ignorantly nods. The WORM squeezes the
text: fuel line bubble a couple of times then gives the cord a firm pull. The engine starts up immediately. The propellers start spinning.
dialog: All
dialog: Aaah!
dialog: The WORM, proud of
dialog: himself, adds:
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: See?
dialog: All
dialog: (Yelling)
dialog: Ahhhhh!
dialog: Just then, the
text: propellers catch the surface of the deck of the ship. Wood chips fly as the spinning blades propel the engine all the
text: way across the deck - ripping a trail in the planks. Cut to shots of the
text: propeller chasing characters through screen. They scream as the motor follows.
text: It then crashes through the guard rail on the bow of the ship and drops into
text: the sea. Everyone stares in disbelief.
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Yep. That's how it
dialog: works.
dialog: Everyone turns
text: angrily to the worm, who is standing there dumbfounded. He notices the glares and becomes
dialog: frightened.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: It has been
dialog: delightful, but I must go now...
speaker_heading: The WORM runs away
text: from the group and dives into an Art Bigotti bowling bag in the pirate's pile
text: of leisure gear next to the card table.
text: We cut to CU of JONAH who offers a resigned look as the camera pushes in
dialog: to his eyes- this is his fate. He has
dialog: no other choice but to...
dialog: Exterior -
text: day. The Plank of Pirate ship at sea
dialog: We pull out of
text: JONAH'S face to reveal a different background.
text: He's now standing on the "plank" of the ship and is wearing a
text: little ducky flotation ring and a swim cap.
text: The PIRATES stand at the base of the plank with their heads bowed and
text: their eyes closed. The storm continues
dialog: to rage.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: (Praying)
dialog: Oh Lord, don't let
dialog: us die for this man's sin. And don't hold us responsible for his death, because
dialog: it isn't our fault. O Lord, you have sent this storm upon him for your own good
dialog: reasons.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: And keep my ducky
dialog: safe.
speaker_heading: PIrates
dialog: Amen.
speaker_heading: The PIRATES look up
text: from their prayer to JONAH. He looks at
text: them, gulps, then turns toward the sea.
dialog: Jonah
dialog: Gulp!
dialog: We cut to the WORM
text: poking his head out of the bowling bag - he looks sad for his friend. JONAH
text: bounces a few times then jumps off the plank and splashes into the sea. Immediately, the winds begin to die down and
text: the sea starts to calm. The clouds part
text: and sun shines once again. In a matter
text: of seconds, the sea and air are completely calm. JONAH bobs up and down softly in his little ducky ring. He looks around. The PIRATES, a little surprised that their plan actually worked,
text: look over the side of the ship at JONAH.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: That was easy.
dialog: Exterior -
dialog: day. Underwater
dialog: We cut to a below
text: the water looking up at JONAH shot. We hear the PIRATE'S voices through the
text: water as OMINOUS "JAWS-LIKE" STRINGS sound.
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: Well.. Should we
dialog: pull him back in?
speaker_heading: BAAAA DUMMM
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: I don't see why
dialog: not.
speaker_heading: BAAAA DUMMM
speaker_heading: EXTERIOR -
scene_heading: DAY. PIRATE SHIP AT SEA
text: PIRATES looking at
text: JONAH. LARRY acquires a lifesaver ring and tosses it out to JONAH. He misses by
dialog: a mile.
speaker_heading: JONAH is not sure
text: what to make of the situation. He thinks for a moment and then opens his mouth
text: to speak. Before he can say anything,
text: something brushes up against him causing him to turn a few degrees. STRINGS back in. BAAAA DUMM. JONAH looks
text: nervous. The PIRATES look nervous. STRINGS back in full. LARRY pulls the ring
text: back in quickly and throws it out again. Not even close. JONAH looks over at
text: the distant ring and gets pushed a few feet through the water as the music
text: intensifies. JONAH is getting very scared.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Something touched
dialog: me!... There's something in the water!...
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE and MR
text: LUNT yell frantically as LARRY pulls the ring back in once again.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Hurry up! Hurry!
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: I'm hurrying!
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Hang on, Jonah!
dialog: (to Lunt)
dialog: Aim this time!
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: I was aiming!
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: I can never tell
dialog: where you're looking...
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: You should talk!
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Hurry!
dialog: Lunt throws the
dialog: ring... It misses again.
speaker_heading: JoNAH (cont'd)
dialog: Fellows... please!
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: Pull it back in.
dialog: Hurry!
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: Okay, okay! I got
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: Let me do that!
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: No, no! I'll throw
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Fellows... Please!
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: Com'on! Give it
dialog: here!
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: I said I got
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: LarrY
dialog: Excuse me,
dialog: gentlemen! Perhaps I can be of some assistance.
speaker_heading: LARRY tosses the
text: ring. This time it's headed right for JONAH! Slow motion. Very dramatic. Very
text: Bay Watch. The ring lands perfectly around JONAH - just like the ring toss at
text: the carnival! LARRY smiles - proud of his achievement. MUSIC relaxes slightly.
text: LARRY begins to pull JONAH in. Just as JONAH begins to move toward the boat -
text: looking a little more hopeful, we see a GIANT WHALE come to the surface behind
text: JONAH and swallow him whole. The PIRATE'S expressions turn from relief to
dialog: shock. LARRY reacts:
speaker_heading: LARRY (cont'd)
dialog: Oops.
dialog: One of the Pirates
text: notice that the life-ring rope is sailing out very rapidly, as the whale swims
text: away with the life-ring in it's mouth.
text: They are attached to the whale.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Huh? (Gasp)
dialog: The rope reaches
text: its full length, pulls taut, and then the metal cleat fastening it to the mast
text: breaks loose, sailing toward the front of the ship. They are no longer attached to the whale!
speaker_heading: pirateS
dialog: (all relieved)
dialog: [sigh]
dialog: Back to the cleat,
text: which sails towards the bow. It fails
text: to clear the rail, however, and instead wedges firmly against the front rail. Back to the Pirates, whose faces fall as
text: they realize they are one again attached to the whale.
dialog: pirates (cont'd)
dialog: Hm?
dialog: Before they can
text: speak, the boat jerks into motion. All
text: three Pirates are knocked backwards off their feet, rolling head over heals all
text: the way across the deck to the wall of the poop deck.
speaker_heading: PIRATES (cont'd)
dialog: Aaaaaaahhh!!!
speaker_heading: The SHIP races
text: through the water. PA GRAPE gets up and frantically looks around for a solution
dialog: to the problem.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Man the cannon!
speaker_heading: Mr LUNT
dialog: Aye, aye cap'n!
dialog: Larry and Pa run up
text: to the cannon at the bow. Mr. Lunt
text: looks on concerned.
speaker_heading: MR. LUNT
dialog: (standing)
dialog: We don't got no
dialog: ammo!
speaker_heading: LARRY looks around
text: and spots the pile of leisure gear.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Oh yes we do!
dialog: The ship races
dialog: through the water.
dialog: Exterior -
dialog: day. Cannon of pirate ship.
dialog: Our brave buccaneer
text: LARRY stuffs the cannon with various leisure items and fire them off. A TENNIS
speaker_heading: RACKET,
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Fire one!
dialog: MR LUNT pulls a
text: string on the cannon. The TENNIS RACKET
text: flies out, spins wildly out of control and splashes into the sea nowhere near
text: the whale. LARRY then stuffs in two croquet mallets.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: Fire Two!
speaker_heading: MR LUNT pulls the
text: string on the cannon. Same result. LARRY then spots the ammo jackpot - the Art
text: Bigotti bowling ball bag. He removes the ball and places in the cannon. Just
text: before the ball sinks into the cannon, the worm pops his head out of the
text: thumb-hole and says pathetically...
speaker_heading: kHALIL
dialog: Hello?!?
text: The BALL drops in.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Fire three!
speaker_heading: MR LUNT pulls the
text: string. The Ball comes roaring out of the cannon. We follow it's flight as the worm pops his head out of the thumb
text: hole again and screams in terror.
speaker_heading: kHALIL
speaker_heading: AAAAAAAAIIIIIII'm
dialog: coming traveling buddy!
speaker_heading: From the WORM'S
text: POV, the camera flies to where the WHALE had been - but now it is nowhere in
text: sight. Presumably it has gone deep below the surface. We cut back to the WORM,
text: who looks confused. He calls out and whistles as if looking for a lost dog;
speaker_heading: kHALIL (cONT'D)
dialog: Traveling buddy?..
dialog: (whistle) Where are you?
speaker_heading: Suddenly, the WHALE
text: leaps out of the water catching the bowling ball in his mouth like a dog
text: catching a treat. Hanging in the air (ala Free Willy), he holds it in it his
text: mouth and we hear a loud gulping noise.
text: With that, the WHALE crashes back into the sea, releasing the life
text: preserver as he disappears.
dialog: We see the life
text: preserver pop out of the water. As it does, the PIRATE SHIP slows - they are no
text: longer attached to the WHALE.
dialog: 100 ft off the bow
text: of the ship, The PIRATES stand and look out in relief toward sea as the ship
text: comes to a stop. Pause as they reflect.
text: Pa and Mr. Lunt remove their hats in respect.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Now that boy really
dialog: knows how to go fish.
speaker_heading: The RUBBER DUCKY
text: floatation ring pops out of the water in the foreground. Larry face lights up. He turns to the others, who do not share his
text: joy. Self-consciously, he tries to
dialog: match their somber looks.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
dialog: int. - whale.
dialog: The scene is quite
text: dark, with JONAH forlornly sitting on a barrel
text: or some other indigestible object inside the whale. After a moment, the bowling ball rolls up next to him.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: Oh, look... a
dialog: bowling ball. If I could only find some
dialog: pins...
dialog: The worm pops up
text: out of the bowling ball like a girl jumping out of a cake.
speaker_heading: kHALIL
dialog: You found better
dialog: than that, travelling buddy! It's me!!
speaker_heading: jONAH
text: (shudders as if he suddenly feels ill)
dialog: Oh, my...
speaker_heading: kHALIL
dialog: So forget about
dialog: Tarshish! All we need to do is get this
dialog: whale to swim to Nineveh! You give the
dialog: message - I sell the plush toys - we'll be right back on track!
speaker_heading: jONAH
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Carlyle, please
dialog: don't speak to me. I'm having a rather
dialog: bad day.
dialog: Jonah stands and
text: walks away from worm, depressed and annoyed.
speaker_heading: kHALIL
dialog: Well you don't need
dialog: to be so down about it - Mr. Grumpy-pants!
text: Jonah whirls back
dialog: toward worm, irate.
dialog: jonah
dialog: Look around
dialog: you! We're inside a whale! We're going to be digested!! Do you know what that means?!?
speaker_heading: kHALIL
dialog: Of course I do!
dialog: Digestion runs very deep in my family.
dialog: I'm just trying to have a positive outlook, you know!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You know the
dialog: difference between you and me is that you see the whale as half empty, but I
dialog: see the whale as half full!
dialog: Jonah is dumbfound.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: I don't know what
dialog: that means.
speaker_heading: kHALIL
dialog: (thinks for a moment)
dialog: Neither do I.
dialog: Worm looses energy
text: - looks around. Jonah turns away and
text: sits down forlornly.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: Oh, I might as well
dialog: face it. God gave me a job to do and I
dialog: disobeyed him. I ran the other
dialog: way! I've done something terrible and
dialog: now I'm getting what I deserve. [sigh.]
dialog: I'm going to die here in this whale.
dialog: The worm looks back
text: at Jonah sympathetically - opens his mouth to speak, but realizes he has no way
dialog: to cheer up his travelling buddy.
text: VOICES are heard from elsewhere in the whale.

dialog: Crusoe-ish.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: (moan)
text: He moans a bit,
text: then rolls over and looks up - right into the face of his camel, Reginald!
speaker_heading: joNAH (cont'd)
dialog: (still on his back)
dialog: Oh! Reginald!
dialog: Good to see you! Yes... well...
speaker_heading: disSOLVE TO:
dialog: ext day - road to
dialog: nineveh
dialog: Lawrence of Arabia
text: shot... endless desert. Jonah rides Reginald across barren countryside. Clip clop, clip clop. Worm is riding in Jonah's bag, peering out
text: at the monotonous landscape, which grows more barren as they near Nineveh - as
dialog: if the cruelty of the Ninevites has disrupted nature.
speaker_heading: pa nARRATOR
dialog: So God told the
dialog: whale to burp up Jonah - and Jonah got his second chance!
speaker_heading: disSOLVE TO:
dialog: Jonah and Khalil
dialog: riding toward Nineveh.
speaker_heading: Pa nARRATOR (cont'd)
dialog: And just like he
dialog: promised, he headed straight for Nineveh!
dialog: Jonah passes
dialog: signs... "Welcome to Nineveh - Home of the Mister Twisty's Twisted Cheese
dialog: Curls!" ... Followed by "Visitors Welcome... To Leave!"
dialog: Jonah and Khalil
text: look pretty nervous. They enter the canyon leading to Nineveh. Jonah looks
text: around, uncomfortably. Then a noise ahead attracts his attention. A CRAZED MAN,
text: possibly from Joppa, is running right at him... His eyes wide with terror.
dialog: Crazed Man
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: Turn back!! Turn
dialog: back!! Turn back!!!
dialog: The man runs right
text: by Jonah, who turns to watch, eyes wide.
speaker_heading: CRAZED MAN (cont'd)
dialog: The slapping!
dialog: Whack! He runs
text: right into an outcrop on the canyon wall... Bounces back, then keeps on going.
speaker_heading: CrAZED MAN (cont'd)
dialog: The slapping!
dialog: Jonah and Khalil
text: stare after, eyes wide. We hear the crazed man's voice trail off in the distance.
speaker_heading: CrAZED MAN (cont'd)
dialog: Turn back! Turn
dialog: back!
dialog: Jonah and Khalil
text: look at each other, clearly frightened, then turn ahead and nervously continue
text: their journey. They continue a bit, and then round a corner. Light from Nineveh
text: fills Jonah's face and he pulls up Reginald in awe of the sight he sees. Just
text: ahead, the canyon opens up and Nineveh spreads out in front of him, under a
text: red, hazy sky. The sound of 'urban chatter' and distant fish slapping drifts
text: up. Swallowing hard, Jonah urges Reginald on. (Maybe we should include a shot
dialog: of Reginald looking back at Jonah reluctantly.)
dialog: Jonah approaches
text: the gate of the great city, and two guards step out in from of him, blocking
text: his path. They are pea Ninevite guards, with Cockney accents. (rapid-fire
dialog: exchange as guards interrupt Jonah.)
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Go in, give the
dialog: message, get out...
dialog: Go in, give the
dialog: message, get out...
dialog: Guard 1
dialog: Who goes 'ere?
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Ah, yes... My name
dialog: is Jonah... And I'm a prophet... from -
dialog: Guard 2
dialog: You're not from
dialog: 'ere, are you?
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Um... No, you see,
dialog: I'm from -
speaker_heading: GUARD 1
dialog: That would make you
dialog: a stranger, wouldn't it?
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Well, um, yes. I
dialog: suppose so... But I -
speaker_heading: GUARD 2
dialog: We don't like
dialog: strangers.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: No... yes, I've
dialog: heard that... But you see I have a -
speaker_heading: GUARD 1
dialog: So why're you
dialog: 'ere?!?
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Well - I have a
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: GUARD 1
dialog: A message? For who?
dialog: Jonah wasn't
dialog: expecting this question.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Well... For
dialog: everyone! For the whole city!
dialog: The guards find
dialog: this ludicrous.
speaker_heading: GUARD 1
dialog: You've got a
dialog: message for the 'ole city?!?
speaker_heading: GUARD 2
dialog: ... the 'ole city?!?
speaker_heading: GuarD 1
dialog: Oh, that's rich!!!
dialog: Guards start to
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: GUARD 2
dialog: I'll alert the
dialog: king! "You're honor! A Bleached asparagus has a message for us all!"
speaker_heading: GUARD 1
dialog: Most important!
dialog: They laugh
text: themselves silly. Khalil pears around Jonah's shoulder.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: I do not think this
dialog: is going very well.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Oh, let's just go
dialog: home! I did what you said, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
dialog: Jonah turns
text: Reginald to leave during this line. Just as he starts to trot away, someone
dialog: calls his name.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE (o.S.)
dialog: Jonah?!?
dialog: Jonah spins around
text: to see the Pirates standing in the entrance to the city, apparently on their
text: way out. They look rather silly, as each wears what appears to be a large foam
text: cheese curl on their head. (similar to Wisconsin's "cheddar heads.")
dialog: Jonah
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
dialog: The Pirates step
text: out of the gate, with mouths agape. Jonah recognizes them, and slides off
dialog: Reginald.
speaker_heading: KhALIL
dialog: (excited)
dialog: It is our friends
dialog: from the ship!
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: (recognizing them)
dialog: What on earth... ?
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: LarrY
dialog: What are you
dialog: doing here?
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: Ya! You were... you
dialog: were...
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: ...fish food!
dialog: The two parties
text: meet off to the side of the gate. While they are talking, Jonah periodically
text: glances up curiously at the Pirates headgear.
speaker_heading: KhALIL
dialog: The whale spit us
dialog: out like so much bad cous-cous, and here we are now! Delivering the message to
dialog: Nineveh!
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: But they wouldn't
dialog: let us in, so I guess we're going home.
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: Hey, I bet we could
dialog: get him in...
dialog: Jonah pulls back,
text: not expecting this. On his shoulder, Khalil smiles broadly.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Huh?
dialog: Cut TO:
dialog: Ext. Nineveh gate -
speaker_heading: momenTS LATER
dialog: CU on Guard 1, who
text: snaps to attention as travelers approach.
dialog: Cut to his POV -
text: the three pirates stand smiling in front of him, with Jonah behind them and
text: Khalil peering from is shoulder. They look like they're posing for a family
dialog: picture. (Though Jonah doesn't look like he wants to be part of the family.)
dialog: Guard 1 softens as
dialog: he recognizes the celebrities
speaker_heading: GuaRD 1
dialog: Hey, look! It's the
dialog: cheese curls blokes!
dialog: The pirates smile.
speaker_heading: GUARD 1 (cont'd)
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: Comin' back for a
dialog: visit, are ya?
dialog: (notices Jonah - hardens)
dialog: Ahem - is this
dialog: fella with you?
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: Oh, yes! He's with
dialog: us!
speaker_heading: GUARD 1
dialog: (to Jonah)
dialog: You're with them,
dialog: eh?
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: (trying to smile)
dialog: Yes, indeed! Why, I
dialog: sailed halfway across the world with these... fine... gentlemen.
dialog: Has to force out
text: those last few words... His smile fading like he's feeling suddenly ill.
speaker_heading: GuARD 1
dialog: (eyeing Jonah suspiciously)
dialog: Alright. You can
dialog: come in.
dialog: (pause as they pass)
dialog: Enjoy your stay in
dialog: Nineveh.
dialog: The group passes
text: through the gate. Jonah and Khalil glance back nervously, to see Guard 1
text: continue to make strange, comically menacing, "eye on you" faces.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: What was that all
dialog: about? How did you do that?
dialog: Pa snaps to,
text: excited to tell his story.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: Remember that money
dialog: you gave us?
dialog: (suddenly concerned)
dialog: By the way, you
dialog: aren't gonna want that refund, are ya?
dialog: Jonah
dialog: (considers)
dialog: Ah...
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Good. Cuz we spent
dialog: it!!! Every last penny! On cheese curls!
dialog: Jonah stares.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Cheese curls?
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: Yup! 1458 bags of
dialog: "Mister Twisty's Twisted Cheese Curls!"
speaker_heading: LarrY
dialog: And you'll never
dialog: guess what we found in bag 497...
dialog: Jonah doesn't have
dialog: a clue.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: (leaning in - hushed tone)
dialog: The golden ticket!
dialog: Jonah doesn't get
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: We won the
dialog: "Mister Twisty's Twisted Cheese Curl Sweepstakes!"
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: And the prize
dialog: was... ?
dialog: Jonah glances back
text: and forth at their hats. Pa looks up.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Mmm hmm. But in
dialog: addition to our enviably fashionable headgear, we also got a tour of Mister
dialog: Twisty's factory - right here in Nineveh!
dialog: The group enters
text: the crowded market area. Ninevites mill around... Assorted fish slapping in the
text: background. Jonah and Khalil aren't wild about what they see.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: Which, despite its
dialog: unseemly location, was a splendid experience!
speaker_heading: LarRY
dialog: And, believe it or
dialog: not, in this town we are famous!
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: (noticing something)
dialog: Hey, look! Here
dialog: comes a city official to greet us!!
dialog: Everyone looks to
text: see a Ninevite and several guards walking aggressively toward them. They do not
dialog: look happy.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: (aloof)
dialog: Hello! We were in
dialog: the neighborhood, so we thought we'd -
dialog: City Official
dialog: (referring to Pirates)
dialog: These are the men!
dialog: Arrest them at once!!
dialog: Everyone's in
dialog: shock.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Excuse me. What
dialog: have they done?
speaker_heading: CITY OFFICIAL
dialog: Thievery! High
dialog: theft against the Royal City of Nineveh!
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: That's ridiculous!!
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: Oh, is it?!?
dialog: He grabs Larry and
text: spins him around. On his back is a small pack. The City Official pulls out a
text: knife, and everyone gasps. He slits the bottom of Larry's pack, and 8-10
text: mini-sized bags of Mister Twisty's Cheese Curls fall to the floor.
speaker_heading: LarrY
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: No! Wait! I thought
dialog: they were free samples!!
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: Take them away!!
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: You can't do that!
dialog: The city official
dialog: spins to Jonah.
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: I'm sorry... are
dialog: you with these men?
dialog: Jonah isn't sure
dialog: how to answer.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Well, um... yes, I
dialog: suppose...
dialog: Jonah glances to
text: the side to see a guard approaching him swiftly.
dialog: Jonah (cont'd)
dialog: Hello... What are
dialog: you doing?
speaker_heading: Jonah's POV - the
text: guard rears back, his fish flashes through the air toward Jonah. SFX - SMACK!
text: And simultaneous BLACKOUT.
dialog: Cut to:
dialog: Ext. Nineveh market
speaker_heading: - latER
dialog: Tight on Jonah's
text: head - covered by a black bag. The bag is pulled off and Jonah blinks around in
dialog: the sunlight.
dialog: Cut to Jonah's POV
text: - a good sized crowd of Ninevites stands in a circle around him, staring
text: intently at him.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: (encouraged)
dialog: Oh! Wonderful! It
dialog: must be time for my speech!
dialog: Cut to bag coming
text: off Pa Grape's head. He tries to move, but is tied tight.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: Hey! I can't move!
dialog: Cut to bag off
text: Lunt's head. He pulls against ropes!
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: I can't move,
dialog: either!!
dialog: Cut to Larry, who's
text: bag is off and who also can't move.
dialog: Cut to Jonah, who
text: looks down confused and realizes that he can't move either. He looks over to Pa
text: in his confusion and sees that...
dialog: (LS Pa) Pa can't
text: move because he's tied back-to-back with Lunt to the front of, beneath a huge,
text: ominously hanging metal fish held up with a rope. This doesn't look good.
dialog: Cut to Jonah's face
text: - his eyes widen and his mouth falls.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: [Gasp!]
dialog: Cut back to LS pa
text: on bulls-eye. Pa looks up and notices Jonah looking at him with panic on his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: What? Have I got
dialog: somethin' on my face?
dialog: Cut to Pa's face -
text: he sees Jonah's situation.
dialog: Cut to LS Jonah
dialog: (Pa's POV) - also, in the same situation.
dialog: Cut to Pa's face
text: who echoes Jonah's reaction.
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: [Gasp!]
dialog: Cut to Lund, who
text: repeats this sequence by looking at Larry's situation.
speaker_heading: luNT
dialog: [Gasp!]
dialog: Cut to Larry, who
text: repeats by looking at Lunt's situation.
dialog: larry
dialog: [Gasp!]
dialog: Jonah
dialog: This doesn't look
dialog: good...
dialog: Cut to Larry, who
dialog: feels responsible.
speaker_heading: LarrY
dialog: (on the verge of tears)
dialog: I'm sorry guys! I
dialog: thought they were free samples. They were right out there in the open... in a
dialog: big bowl. Very misleading!
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: Oh, don't go
dialog: blamin' yourself!
dialog: Lund is cranky with
dialog: Pa.
speaker_heading: LuNT
dialog: No... blame HIM!
dialog: (gestures over shoulder to Pa)
dialog: "Let's put it
dialog: all in cheese curls," he says. "No," I say, "We need a
dialog: BALANCED portfolio!" A little stock, a little bonds... A little cash or
dialog: cash equivalents... And THEN maybe some snacks. But no. "Put it all in
dialog: cheese curls!" he says.
dialog: (to Pa)
dialog: Man, you gotta plan
dialog: for the future!
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: What? It got us
dialog: here, didn't it?!?
dialog: Everyone stares at
text: Pa, confused. Pa realizes what they are thinking.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE (cont'd)
dialog: (gestures around)
dialog: Not
dialog: "here" literally... But...
dialog: (looks off mistily)
dialog: We were somebody!
dialog: We were celebrities!
speaker_heading: LunT
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: We are going to
dialog: die!
dialog: Lunt is interrupted
dialog: by the City Official
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: People of Nineveh!
dialog: These four men...
dialog: (glances toward Khalil)
dialog: ... and that
dialog: small... whatever-it-is...
speaker_heading: KhALIL
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: I am a
dialog: caterpillar!!
dialog: (to self)
dialog: Well, that is only
dialog: half true...
speaker_heading: City OFFICIAL
dialog: Have been found
dialog: guilty of high thievery against the Royal City of Nineveh!
text: The crowd hisses.
speaker_heading: City OFFICIAL (cont'd)
dialog: For their
dialog: punishment... "The Slap of No Return!"
dialog: The crowd looks
text: quizzically at the fish poles, no sure what to make of them. The pirates look
text: up at them, not sure whether to be frightened or not. The City Official notices
dialog: the lack of respect for his latest invention.
dialog: Larry
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: Observe!
dialog: The Pirates and Jonah
text: look on as the City Official places a large pumpkin on a small wooden platform
text: in from of the fifth fish pole. There is a hush as he walks over to the rope,
text: anchored to a stake in the ground, raises a curved sword high in the air, and
text: brings it down, severing the rope
dialog: The fish falls,
text: splattering the pumpkin to bits. Pumpkin hits Jonah's face. After a beat, the
text: crowd starts cheering and the Pirates and Jonah start crying like little
dialog: babies.
dialog: All
dialog: [No! Waaaaaaaaah!
dialog: Etc.]
dialog: Cut to Khalil, who
text: is tied with string to the backside of Jonah. He can't see anything.
speaker_heading: KhALIL
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What is happening
dialog: that is making you all cry like little babies?!?
dialog: Jonah yells over
dialog: the commotion
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Why on earth do you
dialog: take snack food so SERIOUSLY?!?
dialog: The city official
text: turns to answer, but it interrupted by a trumpet fanfare. He spins back to the
dialog: crowd.
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: People of Nineveh!
dialog: I give you... King Twistomer!!
dialog: More trumpet
text: fanfare... Camera pans up the building facing the "condemned" to a
text: balcony several stories overhead. 2 attendants stand on either end of the
text: balcony. From the shadows between them emerges King Twistomer (the giant gourd
dialog: from "Hi Silk Hat" - with Goliath's voice) a very large,
text: grumpy-looking gourd, with more than a passing resemblance to the more chipper,
text: slimmer pitchman Jonah has seen on several snack bags and billboards. The
text: Pirates' jaws drop.
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: It's "Mister
dialog: Twisty"
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Well, that explains
dialog: it!
dialog: Lunt and Larry
text: squint up at the gourd.
speaker_heading: LarRY
dialog: He looks happier on
dialog: the bag.
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: (to King)
dialog: Your royal
dialog: gourdliness... These are the perpetrators of the heinous act against your curls
dialog: of cheese!
dialog: King Twistomer
dialog: scowls.
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL (cont'd)
dialog: For their
dialog: punishment... "The Slap of No Return!"
dialog: A rise from the
text: crowd. King Twistomer smiles.
dialog: King twistomer
dialog: Proceed.
dialog: The city official
text: spins with his sword. Jonah's eyes widen.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Wait!
dialog: (to King)
dialog: Won't you at least
dialog: give the guilty parties the chance to speak in their own defense?!?
dialog: The City Official
text: looks up to the king, who ponders.
speaker_heading: KinG TWISTOMER
dialog: You may speak.
dialog: The sword is
text: lowered. Jonah relaxes a bit.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Well... As I
text: understand it, the snacks in question were right out in the open... In a large
dialog: bowl!!
dialog: (pleading to crowd)
dialog: I think we'll all
dialog: agree this was somewhat misleading...
dialog: (looks for support)
dialog: Don't you think?
dialog: The city official
text: glances to the king. The king ponders... softening... nodding... then looks
dialog: down to the city official.
speaker_heading: KinG TWISTOMER
dialog: Slap them.
dialog: Again the sword
text: flashes high in the air. Jonah panics! The Pirates start whimpering loudly.
text: Jonah no desperately appeals directly to the City Official.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: No! You don't
dialog: understand! I'm not REALLY with them... I mean... How could I be? While they
dialog: were taking the tour, I was in the belly of a whale!!
dialog: The City Official
text: freezes - the sword jerking in his hand. The crowd around them hushes down
text: some. The Official looks up to Jonah quizzically.
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: What... did you...
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: (not really noticing the reaction)
dialog: I said while they
dialog: were on the tour... I was in the belly of a whale!!
dialog: The crowd GASPS.
text: The Official steps back - clearly shaken.
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: But... You are not
dialog: dead!
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: No! That's just it!
dialog: I was in the whale for 3 days and nights! Then I prayed to my God, and the
dialog: great monster spit me up onto the shore... So that I could bring you all a
dialog: message.
dialog: The official is
text: shaken... The crowd whispers among themselves. The king's eyes widen - then
text: narrow. He approaches the edge of the balcony.
speaker_heading: King TWISTOMER
dialog: Hmm... Asparagus...
dialog: Here in Nineveh we bow to the Great Fish... We celebrate the Great Fish in our
dialog: art...
dialog: Jonah looks around
text: at the whale images on buildings and the large metal fish hanging over his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Yes, I noticed...
speaker_heading: King TWISTOMER
dialog: If what you are
dialog: saying is true...
dialog: The King ponders
text: for a moment. The Official steps up and responds...
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: Yes... How do we
dialog: know if he is telling the truth, sire?
speaker_heading: King TWISTOMER
dialog: (to Official)
dialog: Smell him.
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Y-your highness?
speaker_heading: King TWISTOMER
dialog: Smell him.
speaker_heading: The Official
text: awkwardly approaches Jonah, and takes a big whiff. Jonah smells TERRIBLE. He
text: stagers back, reeling... Barely able to stay on his feet.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: I'm... terribly
dialog: sorry... I've been meaning to shower...
dialog: The King's eyes
dialog: widen.
speaker_heading: King TWISTOMER
dialog: He has been in the
dialog: Great Fish. We must hear the message.
dialog: This is so
text: unexpected that Jonah isn't sure what to do next.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: What? Oh...the
dialog: message... Yes...
dialog: Jonah thinks - but
dialog: it has been so long he has a hard time remembering what he was supposed to say.
text: As he stammers, Khalil shakes his head in disbelief.
speaker_heading: JoNAH (cont'd)
dialog: ...the message...
dialog: What was the message?
speaker_heading: KhALIL
dialog: Com'on!
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: (to King)
dialog: It's been so
dialog: long... I...
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh! Yes Ahem...
dialog: (collects himself)
dialog: Stop it!!
dialog: The crowd gasps and
text: recoils. The King's eyes widen.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Stop cheating! Stop
dialog: lying! And especially, stop slapping people with fishes!! Or this entire city
dialog: will be destroyed!!
dialog: Jonah looks around
text: dramatically. The crowd shudders... The King looks concerned. Back to Jonah who
text: is smiling contentedly.
speaker_heading: JoNAH (cont'd)
dialog: A message from the
dialog: Lord!
speaker_heading: Pa nARRATOR
dialog: Well, the King was
dialog: very upset! He had no idea they weren't suppose to do that stuff! No one had
dialog: ever told him that before!
dialog: A decree is handed
dialog: to the city official.
speaker_heading: CiTY OFFICIAL
dialog: A decree from the
dialog: King! Let everyone call urgently to God. Let them give up their evil ways and
dialog: their violence. Perhaps the God that brought this man out of the Great Fish,
dialog: will give us... a second chance!
dialog: Score swells...
text: Crowd erupts... Everyone smiles. Jonah looks around, tugging against his ropes.
speaker_heading: King TWISTOMER
dialog: And let the asparagus
dialog: and his friends go free!
dialog: They are all untied
text: and congratulated by the crowd. Happy, happy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXTERIOR - DAY.
speaker_heading: NINEVEH
dialog: Wide shot of
text: NINEVEH. The clouds have completely
text: moved away and it's a perfectly sunny day. SCORE is triumphant. Birds sing.
text: Flower bouquets fly like graduation caps.
speaker_heading: pa nARRATOR
dialog: So the king and the
dialog: people of Nineveh said they were sorry, stopped the fish-slapping and started
dialog: being nice to people...
dialog: cut to:
dialog: Interior night - seafood restaurant
dialog: laura
dialog: Wow! That's great!
dialog: junior
dialog: Yeah! Everyone musta been really happy, right?
speaker_heading: pa NARRATOR
dialog: Well, almost
dialog: everyone.
speaker_heading: dissOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: ext. day - NINEVEH
dialog: Jonah and worm are
text: being warmly thanked by Ninevites. Worm
text: is eating it up, but Jonah is just nodding along. Several Ninevite kids run happily away from Jonah and the worm,
text: clutching Jonah plush toys to their chests.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: (ad lib)
dialog: Yes, thank you!
dialog: Farewell! Goodbye, thank you!
speaker_heading: KhALIL
dialog: (ad lib)
dialog: Goodbye all you
dialog: lovely people!
speaker_heading: pa NARRATOR
dialog: You see, Jonah
dialog: figured God wouldn't really forgive the Ninevites. I mean, they had done some
dialog: terrible stuff. No! He figured God had something else in mind.
speaker_heading: JoNAH
dialog: Sigh...
dialog: Jonah sits in the
text: sand, silently, staring at Nineveh. The
dialog: worm is a bit confused.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: What are we doing?
dialog: jonah
dialog: Oh, it's time to
dialog: watch the fun!
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: Aaaand what fun
dialog: would that be?
dialog: jonah
dialog: Well, I did what I
dialog: was supposed to do... I warned them that they were going to get in big
dialog: trouble! So now that they've had their
dialog: warning, it's time to watch God wipe them off the face of the Earth! Aha!
dialog: Worm looks at Jonah
text: quizzically. Jonah doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: jONAH (cont'd)
dialog: I picked a safe
dialog: distance so we won't get singed.
dialog: Jonah sits back to
dialog: watch the destruction. The worm looks
text: at Jonah, then looks at Nineveh.
text: Time goes by. The hot sun beats down. Nothing happens. Jonah is sweating, but still smiling.
speaker_heading: joNAH (cont'd)
dialog: This is going to be
dialog: great! The bad guys! Finally getting what they deserve!
text: More time goes by. The sun is intense. Jonah is wilting.
dialog: pa narrator
dialog: So Jonah waited for
dialog: God to destroy Nineveh. Even now, God
dialog: was compassionate towards Jonah and caused a plant to grow that shaded him from
dialog: the hot sun.
dialog: Jonah looks up and
text: sees large weed hanging overhead
dialog: like an umbrella.
speaker_heading: joNAH
dialog: Hmm? Oh! Yes! Very nice!
dialog: Thank you! Very nice!
dialog: He settles in to
text: watch some more. The worm looks back
dialog: and forth between Jonah and Nineveh.
text: Then he notices the weed and looks -
dialog: suddenly - hungry.
dialog: pa narrator
dialog: Jonah kept waiting.
dialog: But it didn't seem like anything was
dialog: happening! He wondered if maybe God was
dialog: forgetting something.
dialog: Jonah stands and
text: looks up toward heaven, then back to Nineveh.
dialog: jonah
dialog: Alright! I did my job! So... fire!
dialog: Brimstone! Whatever! You pick!
dialog: Right over there!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'll just... sit
dialog: here under my weed... and wait.
dialog: Jonah sits back
text: down and forces a smile, leaning up against the weed. Without warning, the weed and Jonah crash to the ground. Jonah sits up quickly and looks around.
speaker_heading: jONAH (cont'd)
dialog: What? - What
dialog: happened?
dialog: Jonah spies worm,
text: happily munching a mouthful of weed, and sees the partially chewed weed stump.
speaker_heading: jONAH (cont'd)
dialog: What? How could you?!?
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Hmm? All your whining made me hungry! It was just a weed...
speaker_heading: jONAH
dialog: (suddenly despondent)
dialog: Just a weed?!? It - it was my shade! It was my friend!
dialog: (melodramatic)
dialog: Oh, dear Lord, how
dialog: could you let this happen?!?
dialog: Jonah mourns for
dialog: the weed like a fallen comrade. The
dialog: worm can take it no more.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: Would you look at
dialog: yourself?!?
dialog: Jonah looks up -
text: startled by the worm's intensity.
speaker_heading: KHALIL (cont'd)
dialog: You care more about
dialog: that weed than about all the people in Nineveh!!
speaker_heading: jONAH
dialog: Well... I...
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: Why are you here
dialog: now? Instead of back in the belly of
dialog: that whale?
dialog: Jonah opens his
text: mouth, but doesn't have an answer.
speaker_heading: KHALIL (cONT'D)
dialog: Because God is
dialog: compassionate! He wanted to help
dialog: you! And because he is merciful! He gave you a second chance!
speaker_heading: jONAH
dialog: (chipper)
dialog: Oh, yes - and I'm very
dialog: grateful-
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: Has it ever
dialog: occurred to you that maybe God loves everybody! Not just you! That maybe he wants to give everyone
dialog: a second chance!
speaker_heading: jONAH
dialog: Uh - well...
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: He saw that those
dialog: people needed help - that they didn't know right from wrong - and he wanted to
dialog: help them! And that is why he sent you!
speaker_heading: jONAH
dialog: Ah-
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: And when you told
dialog: them what they were doing wrong they said they were sorry - they put down their
dialog: mackerels and their halibuts - and they asked God for a second chance. And by golly, he gave them one!!
dialog: (Jonah ponders)
dialog: Don't you see? God wants to give everyone a
dialog: second chance! And so should we!
dialog: Jonah is initially
text: moved by this truth, but then becomes theatrically pouty - like the spoiled
text: rich kid who isn't getting his way.
speaker_heading: jONah
dialog: Well, if they
dialog: get a second chance - those fish-slappers - well, then... it would be better if
dialog: I were dead!
dialog: (flops onto the ground)
dialog: Oh, I wish I were
dialog: back in that whale!
dialog: Jonah is a basket
text: case. The worm looks at him in
dialog: disbelief.
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: You are pathetic.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You know, patience
dialog: runs very deep in my family... but not that deep. I'm out of here!
dialog: Khalil starts to
dialog: walk off.
speaker_heading: jONah
dialog: What? What are you doing?
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: (turning back)
dialog: I wanted to be big
dialog: and important... just like you! But the
dialog: world doesn't need more people who are "big and important," the world
dialog: needs more people who are nice.
dialog: And compassionate. And merciful.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That's what I want
dialog: to be.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You can find
dialog: yourself a new traveling buddy.
dialog: Goodbye.
speaker_heading: jONah
dialog: You can't just
dialog: leave!
speaker_heading: KHALIL
dialog: Can and am!
speaker_heading: jONah
dialog: But... who will I
dialog: talk to? You can't just leave me here
dialog: all alone?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: Reginald? Carlisle?
dialog: Khowleel? Carleel? Howie? (etc... ad lib)
dialog: Jonah tries to call
text: the worm's name - but can't get the pronunciation right. He tries several times with comical results
text: as the camera cranes higher above him, revealing the worm walking further and
text: further away and Jonah looking smaller and more alone.
dialog: cut TO:
dialog: int. night -
dialog: seafood restaurant
dialog: Abrupt cut to shot
text: of Pirates peering over booth.
dialog: pa grape
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: The end!
dialog: Immediately, the
text: Pirates slide the Plexiglas divider shut between the two booths. It shuts with a loud whack, startling the
text: listeners in the next booth who continue staring in disbelief.
dialog: bob
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Wait a minute...
dialog: its's over?
dialog: pa grape (os)
dialog: Yup!
dialog: Bob
dialog: That's how it
dialog: ends?!?
speaker_heading: Pa GRAPE
dialog: Yup!
dialog: junior
dialog: But what did Jonah
dialog: learn?
dialog: Lunt opens screen
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: lunT
dialog: (looking at Junior)
dialog: The question, my
dialog: friends, is not "what did Jonah learn." The question is - what did you learn?
dialog: junior
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Well, I learned
dialog: that we need to help people who need help...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And we need to give
dialog: 2nd chances. Even if they don't deserve them.
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: But what's that got
dialog: to do with us?
dialog: Pa turns and looks
text: directly at Bob, who startles.
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE
dialog: Hey... tomato...
dialog: bob
dialog: Eh?
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE
dialog: Your friend
dialog: there... the big asparagus. If I'm not
dialog: mistaken, he didn't do such a good job helping you with the map.
dialog: bob
dialog: Oh, it was a
dialog: disaster! He said he was sorry and that
dialog: he'd do better next time, but no way!
dialog: Uh uh!
text: (Bob realizes what he's said and looks down)
dialog: Mercy. I guess everyone deserves a second
dialog: chance.
dialog: Dad Asparagus
dialog: smiles.
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE
dialog: Yup! Now get outa
dialog: here before my crab legs get cold!
dialog: Pirates shut window
dialog: once more. Veggies smile, then Dad
text: snaps out of the "feel good" moment.
dialog: dad
dialog: You know, that
dialog: still wasn't a very good way to end a story!
text: Others agree. From across the barrier, Pa yells out...
speaker_heading: pa GRAPE (os)
dialog: Well, whadya
dialog: want? A big musical number?!?
dialog: Everyone looks at
dialog: each other and agrees that sound pretty good.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well... yeah!
dialog: Pa turns to Larry.
speaker_heading: PA GRAPE
dialog: Who do they think I
dialog: am... Twippo?
dialog: A male voice from
dialog: the lobby.
dialog: voice (o.S.)
dialog: Yes?
dialog: Several veggies
text: look up, as they recognize the voice.
text: They turn in their seats and peer over the booth to the entry-way, where
dialog: they see none other than Twippo himself!
dialog: (Archibald Asparagus, dressed in an Elvis-y sort of outfit.)
dialog: veggies
dialog: Twippo!!!
dialog: Twippo smiles - a
text: little apprehensively. Veggies rush him
dialog: - Bob in front.
speaker_heading: VeGGIES (cont'd)
dialog: Yeah... (etc., ad
dialog: lib)
speaker_heading: bOB
dialog: What are you
dialog: doing here?!?
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Well, I've got a
dialog: concert tonight, but I'm running late!
dialog: Can't find Route 59 to save my life!
dialog: So I stopped here for directions.
dialog: jr.
dialog: We're going to your
dialog: concert tonight!
dialog: (pause - looks down)
dialog: At least we were...
dialog: bob
dialog: (downcast)
dialog: And then...
dialog: porcupines!!
speaker_heading: dAD
dialog: ... and underwear!!
dialog: Annie
dialog: ... and pirates!!
speaker_heading: bOB
dialog: ... and now it
dialog: looks like we aren't going to make it at all.
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Good heavens! Well, if it's a ride you need, I've got
dialog: plenty of room in my bus... you can all come with me!
dialog: Veggies eyes widen
dialog: - big smiles!
speaker_heading: veGGIES
dialog: [That's be
dialog: great! Wow! etc.]
dialog: Laura looks down -
dialog: she can't come.
speaker_heading: lAURA
dialog: ...yeah. Everyone
dialog: but me.
dialog: Junior notices...
text: Thinks...camera pushes in slowly as Junior makes his big decision. Touching
text: score. Junior smiles and offers Laura his ticket.
speaker_heading: JR
dialog: Laura... You can
dialog: have my ticket.
dialog: Pause on Laura. She
text: is surprised and touched.
speaker_heading: LaURA
dialog: But Junior, it was
dialog: my fault.
dialog: Junior simply
text: smiles and lifts the ticket up to her once again. Laura looks tenderly at
text: Junior and smiles.
dialog: Everyone smiles -
text: amazed. Score swells.
dialog: Twippo is
dialog: impressed.
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Why, that was a
dialog: very compassionate thing to do!
dialog: Bob
dialog: And merciful!
speaker_heading: TwipPO
dialog: Tell you what...
dialog: I'll give you all a ride to the concert, and I'll make sure you ALL get have
dialog: backstage passes!
dialog: Veggies erupt in
dialog: celebration. Happy, happy!
speaker_heading: VeGGIES
dialog: (celebration!)
dialog: Hurray! (ad lib)
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Speaking of mercy,
dialog: have any of you heard the story of a man named... Jonah?
dialog: Veggies freeze, not
dialog: sure what to say, then all respond at once.
speaker_heading: veGGIES
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Twippo is taken
dialog: aback.
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Oh. Well... uh, would you like to hear a song
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: pERCY
dialog: Is it like the bald
dialog: bunny song?
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Not really... it's
dialog: more of a 'big musical number.'
speaker_heading: dAD
dialog: Perfect!
dialog: wipe to:
dialog: Twippo on stage at
dialog: Seafood Restaurant. Theatrical lights
text: on him. He's holding his guitar, ready
dialog: to play.
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: (singing - ballad-like)
dialog: When I was a boy I
dialog: went to church back home in Arizona
dialog: And that was where
dialog: I heard the tale of a man whose name was Jonah!
dialog: Now Jonah was a
dialog: prophet, but that's not why he's remembered.
dialog: We tell the tale,
dialog: 'cuz in a whale he nearly was dismembered!
dialog: Horns and drums
dialog: jump in - big band feel. Either curtain
text: behind Twippo or wall itself pulls back to reveal Broadway musical-ish set with
text: fake, 2D pirate ship rocking to beat on fake, 2D waves. Actual pirates are perched atop fake ship.
speaker_heading: pirATES
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Jonah was a
dialog: prophet!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Ooh, ooh!
dialog: pirates
dialog: But he really never
dialog: got it!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Sad, but true!
speaker_heading: PIRATES
dialog: If you've been
dialog: watching you can spot it!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Doodle-ee-doo!
speaker_heading: PIRATES
dialog: He did not get the
dialog: point!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Compassion and
dialog: mercy!
dialog: From me to you and
dialog: you to me!
dialog: Exactly what God
dialog: wants to see!
dialog: And yes, that is
dialog: the point!
speaker_heading: pirATES
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Jonah was a
dialog: prophet!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Ooh, ooh!
dialog: pirates
dialog: But he really never
dialog: got it!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Sad, but true!
speaker_heading: PIRATES
dialog: If you've been
dialog: watching you can spot it!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Doodle-ee-doo!
speaker_heading: PIRATES
dialog: He did not get the
dialog: point!
dialog: Twippo, now playing
text: the role of Jonah, jumps up on the pirate ship cutout.
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Now Jonah set sail
dialog: On a pirate ship in
dialog: a dreadful gale
dialog: Wind blows, fake
dialog: lighting. Pirates takeover narrative as
text: Twippo either falls or flies on a line into the mouth of a fake whale cutout
text: that has been wheeled on stage.
speaker_heading: piRATES
dialog: Got eaten up by a
dialog: giant whale
dialog: But managed not to
dialog: be dead.
dialog: Twippo sticks his
text: head out of the top of the whale, (blowhole region) to prove he's still
text: alive. Smiles big.
speaker_heading: pirATES (cont'd)
dialog: You'd think he
dialog: would learn a lot
dialog: From being saved
dialog: from a awful spot
dialog: But the second
dialog: chance that he had got
dialog: He didn't want to
dialog: be spread!
dialog: Whale cutout leaves
dialog: - maybe pull in Nineveh cutout, or string of Ninevites for Twippo to scowl
dialog: at. Musical break - little dance time -
text: then set changes to Jonah on hill, under cutout weed. Pirates get melodramatically sorrowful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: piRATES (cont'd)
dialog: (weepy)
dialog: So poor old Jonah -
dialog: Now he's all
dialog: alone-a!
dialog: Pirates raise
text: energy as giant megaphone cutout lowers from above, letting them yell at Jonah
dialog: on hill.
speaker_heading: PIRATES (cont'd)
dialog: Gotta use a
dialog: megaphone-a!
dialog: To get it through
dialog: to his head!
dialog: (shouted through megaphone)
dialog: Hey!!!
dialog: Hill and weed
text: "blow away" from force of shouted 'hey.' Twippo stands and comes forward on stage, no longer playing
dialog: Jonah.
speaker_heading: pirATES (cont'd)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Jonah was a
dialog: prophet!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Ooh, ooh!
dialog: pirates
dialog: But he really never
dialog: got it!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Sad, but true!
speaker_heading: PIRATES
dialog: If you've been
dialog: watching you can spot it!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Doodle-ee-doo!
speaker_heading: PIRATES
dialog: He did not get the
dialog: point!
dialog: Musical break -
dialog: seque ways into more intimate spoken part.
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: (spoken)
dialog: Now, true, in your
dialog: life you probably don't ride on a camel
dialog: And you probably
text: won't wake up inside a large, aquatic mammal.
dialog: But all the same,
dialog: like Jonah, there is something you can do -
dialog: Everyone deserves to get a second chance from you!
dialog: Big horn sting,
dialog: then all sing together...
dialog: all
dialog: Compassion and
dialog: mercy!
dialog: From me to you and
dialog: you to me!
dialog: Exactly what God
dialog: wants to see!
dialog: And yes, that is
dialog: the point!
dialog: Start
dialog: "bringing it down." Maybe
text: Twippo starts pulling pirate ship across stage, faking an 'exit.'
speaker_heading: pirATES
dialog: (softer)
dialog: Jonah was a
dialog: prophet!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: (softer)
dialog: Ooh, ooh!
dialog: pirates
dialog: But he really never
dialog: got it!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Sad, but true!
speaker_heading: pirATES
dialog: (even softer)
dialog: Jonah was a
dialog: prophet!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Ooh, ooh!
dialog: pirates
dialog: But he really never
dialog: got it!
speaker_heading: Twippo
dialog: Sad, but true!
dialog: Stop exit at
text: center-stage - turn and strike a pose.
speaker_heading: pirATES
dialog: (loud)
dialog: Jonah was a
dialog: prophet!
dialog: Big chord - end of
text: song. Crowd goes wild. Voice heard from the foyer...
speaker_heading: KhaliL
dialog: I beg your pardon.
dialog: I hate to break up the party, but who needed a tow?
dialog: Everyone looks at
dialog: Khalil.
speaker_heading: TwiPPO
dialog: Ah... Have we met?
text: Khalil smiles at
dialog: camera - cut to black
speaker_heading: THE END
